An ha'penny invested in a London newspaper gave them the news\r\nthat Niazi bey had taken to the Macedonian highlands, and that a\r\nrevolution was threatening to overthrow the absolutist _régime_ of\r\nAbdul Hamid.  The sixteenth century was forgotten in the absorbing and\r\ncompelling interest of the twentieth.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later the students were entering the harbour of Smyrna on a\r\nFrench steamer which was bringing back to constitutional Turkey the\r\nYoung Turk exiles, including Prince Sabaheddine effendi of the Royal\r\nOttoman House.  From that day to this, the path of the two Americans,\r\nwhose knowledge of history heretofore had been gained only in\r\nlibraries, has led them through massacres in Asia Minor and Syria, and\r\nthrough mobilizations and wars in Constantinople, Bulgaria, Macedonia,\r\nGreece, and Albania, back westward to Austria-Hungary, {x} Italy, and\r\nFrance, following the trail of blood and fire from its origin in the\r\nEastern question to the great European conflagration.\r\n\r\nOn the forty-fourth anniversary of Sedan, when German aëroplanes were\r\nflying over Paris, and the distant thunder of cannon near Meaux could\r\nbe heard, this book was begun in the Bibliothèque Nationale by one of\r\nthe students, while the other yielded to the more pressing call of Red\r\nCross work. It is hoped that there is nothing that will offend in what\r\nis written here. At this time of tension, of racial rivalry, of mutual\r\nrecrimination, the writer does not expect that his judgments will pass\r\nwithout protest and criticism. But he claims for them the lack of bias\r\nwhich, under the circumstances, only an American--of this generation at\r\nleast--dare impute to himself.\r\n\r\nThe changes that are bringing about a new map of Europe have come\r\nwithin the intimate personal experience of the writer.\r\n\r\nIf foot-notes are rare, it is because sources are so numerous and so\r\naccessible. Much is what the writer saw himself, or heard from actors\r\nin the great tragedy, when events were fresh in their memory. The books\r\nof the colours, published by the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of the\r\ncountries interested, have been consulted for the negotiations of\r\ndiplomats. From day to day through these years, material has been\r\ngathered from newspapers, especially the Paris _Temps_, the London\r\n_Times_, the Vienna _Freie Press_, the Constantinople _Orient_, and\r\nother journals of the Ottoman capital.  {xi} The writer has used his\r\nown correspondence to the New York _Herald_, the New York\r\n_Independent_, and the Philadelphia _Telegraph_.  For accuracy of\r\ndates, indebtedness is acknowledged to the admirable British _Annual\r\nRegister_.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to my friends, Alexander Souter, Litt.D., Professor of\r\nHumanity in Aberdeen University, and Mrs. Souter, for reading the\r\nproofs of this book and seeing it through the press in England.  In the\r\nUnited States, the same kind office has been performed by my brother,\r\nHenry Johns Gibbons, Esq., of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nAs this book goes to press for the third American edition, I wish to\r\nexpress my thanks to readers in Great Britain, America, France,\r\nGermany, and Australia for suggestions and corrections, and in\r\nparticular to Baron Shaw of Dunfermline, to whom I owe the idea of the\r\nmap that has been added to face the title-page.\r\n\r\nPARIS, July, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE\r\n  NEW MAP OF EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{1}\r\n\r\nThe New Map of Europe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nGERMANY IN ALSACE AND LORRAINE\r\n\r\nThe war of 1870 added to the German Confederation Alsace and a large\r\nportion of Lorraine, both of which the Germans had always considered\r\ntheirs historically and by the blood of the inhabitants.  In annexing\r\nAlsace and Lorraine, the thought of Bismarck and von Moltke was not\r\nonly to bring back into the German Confederation territories which had\r\nformerly been a part of it, but also to secure the newly formed Germany\r\nagainst the possibility of French invasion in the future.  For this it\r\nwas necessary to have undisputed possession of the valley of the Rhine\r\nand the crests of the Vosges.\r\n\r\nFrom the academic and military point of view, the German thesis was not\r\nindefensible.  But those who imposed upon a conquered people the Treaty\r\nof Frankfort forgot to take into account the sentiments of the\r\npopulation of the annexed territory.  Germany annexed land.  That was\r\npossible by the {2} right of the strongest.  She tried for over forty\r\nyears to annex the population, but never succeeded.  The makers of\r\nmodern Germany were not alarmed at the persistent refusal of the\r\nAlsatians to become loyal German subjects.  They knew that this would\r\ntake time.  They looked forward to the dying out of the party of\r\nprotest when the next generation grew up,--a generation educated in\r\nGerman schools and formed in the German mould by the discipline of\r\nmilitary service.\r\n\r\nThat there was still an Alsace-Lorraine \"question\" after forty years is\r\na sad commentary either on the justice of the annexation of\r\nAlsace-Lorraine by Germany or on the ability of Germany to assimilate\r\nthat territory which she felt was historically, geographically, and\r\nracially a part of the Teutonic Empire.  In 1887, when \"protesting\r\ndeputies\" were returned to the _Reichstag_ in overwhelming numbers,\r\ndespite the governmental weapons of intimidation, disenfranchisement,\r\nand North German immigration, Bismarck was face to face with the one\r\ngreat failure of his career.  He consoled himself with the firm belief\r\nthat all would be changed when the second generation, which knew\r\nnothing of France and to which the war was only a memory, peopled the\r\nunhappy provinces.\r\n\r\nBut that second generation came.  Those who participated in the war of\r\n1870, or who suffered by it, were few and far between.  The hotheads\r\nand extreme francophiles left the country long ago, and their place was\r\ntaken by immigrants who were supposed to be loyal sons of the\r\nVaterland.  Those of {3} the younger indigenous brood, whose parents\r\nhad brought them up as irreconcilables, ran away to serve in the French\r\nforeign legion, or went into exile, and became naturalized Frenchmen\r\nbefore their time of military service arrived.  And yet the unrest\r\ncontinued.  Strasbourg, Metz, Mulhouse, and Colmar were centres of\r\npolitical agitation, which an autocratic government and Berlin police\r\nmethods were powerless to suppress.\r\n\r\nThe year 1910 marked the beginning of a new period of violent protest\r\nagainst Prussian rule.  Not since 1888 was there such a continuous\r\nagitation and such a continuous persecution.  The days when the\r\nPrussian police forbade the use of the French language on tombstones\r\nwere revived, and the number of petty police persecutions recorded in\r\nthe local press was equalled only by the number of public\r\ndemonstrations on the part of the people, whose hatred of everything\r\nPrussian once more came to a fever-heat.\r\n\r\nLet me cite a few incidents which I have taken haphazard from the\r\njournals of Strasbourg and Metz during the first seven months of 1910.\r\nThe _Turnverein_ of Robertsau held a gymnastic exhibition in which two\r\nFrench societies, those of Belfort and Giromagny, were invited to\r\nparticipate.  The police refused to allow the French societies to march\r\nto the hall in procession, as was their custom, or to display their\r\nflags.  Their two presidents were threatened with arrest.  A similar\r\nincident was reported from Colmar.  At Noisseville and Wissembourg the\r\nfortieth annual commemoration services held by the {4} French veterans\r\nwere considered treasonable, and they were informed that they would\r\nnever again be allowed to hold services in the cemetery.  At Mulhouse\r\nthe French veterans were insulted by the police and not allowed to\r\ndisplay their flags even in the room where they held their banquet.  At\r\nthe college of Thann a young boy of twelve, who curiously enough was\r\nthe son of a notorious German immigrant, whistled the _Marseillaise_\r\nand was locked up in a cell for this offence.  The conferring of the\r\ncross of the Legion of Honour on Abbé Faller, at Mars-la-Tour, created\r\nsuch an outburst of feeling that the German ambassador at Paris was\r\ninstructed to request the French Government to refrain from decorating\r\nAlsatians.  A volunteer of Mulhouse was reprimanded and refused\r\nadvancement in the army because he used his mother-tongue in a private\r\nconversation.  On July 1st, twenty-one border communes of Lorraine were\r\nadded to those in which German had been made the official language.  On\r\nJuly 25th, for the first time in the history of the University of\r\nStrasbourg, a professor was hissed out of his lecture room.  He had\r\nsaid that the Prussians could speak better French than the Alsatians.\r\nThe most serious demonstration which has occurred in Metz since the\r\nannexation, took place on Sunday evening, January 8, 1910, when the\r\npolice broke up forcibly a concert given by a local society.  The\r\nnewspapers of Metz claimed that this was a private gathering, to which\r\nindividual invitations had been sent, and was neither public nor\r\npolitical.  The police invaded the hall, and requested the audience {5}\r\nto disband.  When the presiding officer refused, he and the leader of\r\nthe orchestra were arrested.  The audience, after a lively tussle, was\r\nexpelled from the hall.  Immediately a demonstration was planned to be\r\nheld around the statue of General Ney.  A large crowd paraded the city,\r\nsinging the _Sambre-et-Meuse_ and the _Marseillaise_.  When the police\r\nfound themselves powerless to stop the procession without bloodshed,\r\nthey were compelled to call out the troops to clear the streets with\r\nfixed bayonets.\r\n\r\nThese incidents demonstrated the fact that French ideals, French\r\nculture, and the French language had been kept alive, and were still\r\nthe inspiration of the unceasing--and successful--protest of nearly two\r\nmillion people against the Prussian domination.  The effervescence was\r\nundoubtedly as strong in Alsace-Lorraine \"forty years after\" as it had\r\nbeen on the morrow of the annexation.  But its francophile character\r\nwas not necessarily the expression of desire for reunion with France.\r\nThe inhabitants of the \"lost provinces\" had always been, racially and\r\nlinguistically, as much German as French.  Now that the unexpected has\r\nhappened, and reunion with France seems probable, many Alsatians are\r\nclaiming that this has been the unfailing goal of their agitation.  But\r\nit is not true.  It would be a lamentable distortion of fact if any\r\nsuch record were to get into a serious history of the period in which\r\nwe live.\r\n\r\nThe political ideal of the Alsatians has been self-government.  Their\r\nagitation has not been for separation _from_ the German Confederation,\r\nbut {6} for a place _in_ the German Confederation.  A great number of\r\nthe immigrants who were sent to \"germanize\" Alsace and Lorraine came to\r\nside with the indigenous element in their political demands.  If the\r\nquestion of France and things French entered into the struggle, and\r\nbecame the heart of it, two reasons for this can be pointed out: France\r\nstood for the realization of the ideals of democracy to the descendants\r\nof the Strasbourg heroes of 1793; and the endeavour to stamp out the\r\ntraces of the former nationality of the inhabitants of the provinces\r\nwas carried on in a manner so typically and so foolishly Prussian that\r\nit kept alive the fire instead of extinguishing it.  Persecution never\r\nfails to defeat its own ends.  For human nature is keen to cherish that\r\nwhich is difficult or dangerous to enjoy.\r\n\r\nTo understand the Alsace-Lorraine question, from the internal German\r\npoint of view, it is necessary to explain the political status of these\r\nprovinces after the conquest, and their relationship to the Empire, in\r\norder to show that their continued unrest and unhappiness were not due\r\nto a ceaseless and stubborn protest against the Treaty of Frankfort.\r\n\r\nWhen the German Empire was constituted, in 1872, it comprehended\r\ntwenty-five distinct sovereign kingdoms, duchies, principalities, and\r\nfree cities, and in a subordinate position, the territory ceded by\r\nFrance, which was made a _Reichsland_, owned in common by the\r\ntwenty-five confederated sovereignties.  The King of Prussia was made\r\nEmperor of the Confederation, and given extensive executive powers.\r\nTwo assemblies were created to legislate {7} for matters affecting the\r\ncountry as a whole.  The _Bundesrath_ is an advisory executive body as\r\nwell as an upper legislative assembly.  _It is composed of delegates of\r\nthe sovereigns of the confederated states_.  The lower imperial house,\r\nor _Reichstag_, is a popular assembly, whose members are returned by\r\ngeneral elections throughout the Empire.  In their internal affairs the\r\nconfederated states are autonomous, and have their own local\r\nParliaments.  This scheme, fraught with dangers and seemingly\r\nunsurmountable difficulties, has survived; and, thanks to the\r\npredominance of Prussia and the genius of two great emperors, the\r\nseemingly heterogeneous mass has been moulded into a strong and\r\npowerful Empire.\r\n\r\nIn such an Empire, however, there never has been any place for\r\nAlsace-Lorraine.  The conquered territory was not a national entity.\r\nIt had no sovereign, and could not enter into the confederacy on an\r\nequal footing with the other twenty-five states.  The Germans did not\r\ndare, at the time, to give the new member a sovereign, nor could they\r\nconjointly undertake its assimilation.  Prussia, not willing to risk\r\nthe strengthening of a south German state by the addition of a million\r\nand a half to its population, took upon herself what was the logical\r\ntask of Baden or Wurtemberg or Bavaria.\r\n\r\nSo Alsace-Lorraine was an anomaly under the scheme of the organization\r\nof the German Empire.  During forty years the _Reichsland_ was without\r\nrepresentation in the _Bundesrath_, and had thus had no real voice in\r\nthe management of imperial affairs.  By excluding the \"reconquered\r\nbrethren\" from {8} representation in the _Bundesrath_, Germany failed\r\nto win the loyalty of her new subjects.  Where petty states with a\r\ntithe of her population and wealth have helped in shaping the destinies\r\nof the nation, the _Reichsland_ had to feel the humiliation of\r\n\"taxation without representation.\"  It was useless to point out to the\r\nAlsatians that they had their vote in the _Reichstag_.  For the\r\n_Bundesrath_ is the power in Germany.\r\n\r\nNor did Alsace-Lorraine have real autonomy in internal affairs.  The\r\nexecutive power was vested in a _Statthalter_, appointed by the\r\nEmperor, and supported by a foreign bureaucracy and a foreign police\r\nforce.  Before the Constitution of 1911, there was a local Parliament,\r\ncalled the _Landesausschuss_, which amounted to nothing, as the\r\nimperial Parliament had the privilege of initiating and enacting for\r\nthe _Reichsland_ any law it saw fit.  Then, too, the delegates to the\r\n_Landesausschuss_ were chosen by such a complicated form of suffrage\r\nthat they represented the _Statthalter_ rather than the people.  And\r\nthe _Statthalter_ represented the Emperor!\r\n\r\nIn the first decade after the annexation, Prussian brutality and an\r\nunseemly haste to impose military service upon the conquered people led\r\nto an emigration of all who could afford to go, or who, even at the\r\nexpense of material interest, were too high-spirited to allow their\r\nchildren to grow up as Germans.  This emigration was welcomed and made\r\neasy, just as Austria-Hungary encouraged the emigration of Moslems from\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina.  For it enabled Bismarck to introduce a strong\r\nPrussian {9} and Westphalian element into the _Reichsland_ by settling\r\nimmigrants on the vacant properties.  But most of these immigrants,\r\ninstead of prussianizing Alsace, have become Alsatians themselves.\r\nSome of the most insistent opponents of the Government, some of the\r\nmost intractable among the agitators, have been those early immigrants\r\nor their children.  This is quite natural, when we consider that they\r\nhave cast their lot definitely with the country, and are just as much\r\ninterested in its welfare as the indigenous element.\r\n\r\nThe revival of the agitation against Prussian Government in 1910 was a\r\nmovement for autonomy on internal affairs, and for representation in\r\nthe _Bundesrath_.  The Alsatians wanted to be on a footing of\r\nconstitutional equality with the other German States.  One marvels at\r\nthe Prussian mentality which could not see--either with the Poles or\r\nwith the Alsatians--that fair play and justice would have solved the\r\nproblems and put an end to the agitation which has been, during these\r\npast few years especially, a menace on the east and west to the\r\nexistence of the Empire.\r\n\r\nSomething had to be done in the _Reichsland_.  The anomalous position\r\nof almost two million German subjects, fighting for their political\r\nrights, and forming a compact mass upon the borders of France, was a\r\nquestion which compelled the interest of German statesmen, not only on\r\naccount of its international aspect, but also because of the growing\r\nGerman public sentiment for social and political justice.  The\r\n_Reichstag_ was full of champions of the {10} claims of the\r\nAlsatians,--champions who were not personally interested either in\r\nAlsace-Lorraine or in the influence of the agitation in the\r\n_Reichsland_ upon France, but who looked upon the Alsace-Lorraine\r\nquestion as a wrong to twentieth-century civilization.\r\n\r\nOn March 14, 1910, Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg announced to the\r\n_Reichstag_ that the Government was preparing a constitution for\r\nAlsace-Lorraine which would give the autonomy so long and so vigorously\r\ndemanded.  But he had in his mind, not a real solution of the question,\r\nbut some sort of a compromise, which would satisfy the confederated\r\nstates, and mollify the agitators of the _Reichsland, but at the same\r\ntime preserve the Prussian domination in Alsace-Lorraine_.  In June,\r\nHerr Delbrück, Secretary of State for the Interior, was sent to\r\nStrasbourg to confer with the local authorities and representatives of\r\nthe people concerning the projected constitution.  It was during this\r\nvisit that the Alsatians were disillusioned.  A dinner, now famous or\r\nnotorious, whichever you like, was given by the _Statthalter_, to which\r\nrepresentative (!) members of the _Landesausschuss_ were invited.  At\r\nthis dinner the real leaders of the country, such as Wetterlé, Preiss,\r\nBlumenthal, Weber, Bucher, and Theodor,--the very men who had made the\r\ndemand for autonomy so insistent that the Government could no longer\r\nrefuse to entertain it--were conspicuous by their absence.  Those\r\nbidden to confer with Herr Delbrück in no way represented, but were on\r\nthe other hand hostile to, the wishes of the people.\r\n\r\nWe cannot go into the involved story of the fight {11} in the\r\n_Reichstag_ over the new Constitution.  The Delbrück project was\r\napproved by the _Bundesrath_ on December 16, 1910, and debated in the\r\nfollowing spring session of the _Reichstag_.  Despite the warnings of\r\nthe deputies from the _Reichsland_, and the brilliant opposition of the\r\nSocialists, the Constitution given to Alsace-Lorraine, on May 31st, was\r\na pure farce.  In no sense was it what the people of the _Reichsland_\r\nhad wanted, although representation in the _Bundesrath_ was seemingly\r\ngiven to them.  The new Constitution preserved the united sovereignty\r\nof the confederated states, and its delegation to the Emperor, who\r\nstill had the power to appoint and recall at will the _Statthalter_,\r\nand to initiate legislation in local matters.  A _Landtag_ took the\r\nplace of the _Landesausschuss_.  The Upper Chamber of the _Landtag_\r\nconsists of thirty-six members, representing the religious confessions,\r\nthe University and other bodies, the supreme court of Colmar, and the\r\nmunicipalities and chambers of commerce of Strasbourg, Mulhouse, Metz,\r\nand Colmar, to the number of eighteen; _and the other eighteen chosen\r\nby the Emperor_.  The Lower Chamber has sixty members, elected by\r\ndirect universal suffrage, with secret ballot.  Electors over\r\nthirty-five possess two votes, and over forty-five three votes.\r\n\r\nBy forcing this Constitution upon Alsace-Lorraine, the interests of\r\nPrussia and of the House of Hohenzollern were considered to the\r\ndetriment of the interests of the German Empire.  A glorious\r\nopportunity for reconciliation and assimilation was lost.  The Emperor\r\nwould not listen to the admission of {12} Alsace-Lorraine to the\r\n_Bundesrath_ in the only logical way, by the creation of a new dynasty\r\nor a republican form of government, so that the Alsatian votes would\r\nrepresent a _sovereign_ state.  Prussia in her dealings with\r\nAlsace-Lorraine, has always been afraid, on the one hand, of the\r\naddition of _Bundesrath_ votes to the seventeen of Bavaria, Saxony,\r\nBaden, and Wurtemberg, and on the other hand, of the repercussion upon\r\nher internal suffrage and other problems with the Socialists.\r\n\r\nSince 1911, the eyes of many Alsatians have been directed once more\r\ntowards France as the only--if forlorn--hope of justice and peace.\r\nWhat words could be found strong enough to condemn the suicidal folly\r\nof the German statesmen who allowed the disappointment over the\r\nConstitution to be followed by a series of incidents which have been\r\nlike rubbing salt into a raw wound?\r\n\r\nThe first _Landtag_, in conformity to the Constitution of 1911, was\r\nelected in October.  It brought into life a new political party, called\r\n\"The National Union,\" led by Blumenthal, Wetterlé, and Preiss, who\r\nunited for the purpose of demanding what the Constitution had not given\r\nthem--the autonomy of Alsace and Lorraine.  This party was badly beaten\r\nin this first election.  But its defeat was not really a defeat for the\r\nprinciples of autonomy, as the German press stated at the time.  The\r\nmembership of the new _Landtag_ was composed, in majority, of men who\r\nhad been supporters of the demand for autonomy, but who had not joined\r\nthe new party for reasons of local politics.  Herr Delbrück had given\r\n{13} universal suffrage (a privilege the Prussian electorate had never\r\nbeen able to gain in spite of its reiterated demands) to the\r\n_Reichsland_ in the hope that the Socialists would prevent the\r\nNationalists from controlling the Alsatian _Landtag_.  Many Socialists,\r\nhowever, during the elections at Colmar and elsewhere, did not hesitate\r\nto cry in French, \"_Vive la France!  A bas la Prusse!_\"\r\n\r\nThe Prussian expectations were bitterly deceived.  The Landtag promptly\r\nshowed that it was merely the Landesausschuss under another name.  The\r\nnationalist struggle was revived; the same old questions came up again.\r\nThe Government's appropriation \"for purposes of state\" was reduced\r\none-third, and it was provided that the _Landtag_ receive communication\r\nof the purposes for which the money was spent.  The _Statthalter's_\r\nexpenses were cut in half, and a bill, which had always been approved\r\nin previous years, providing for the payment of the expense of the\r\nEmperor's hunting trips in the _Reichsland_, failed to pass.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1912, the Prussians showed their disapproval of the\r\nactions of the new _Landtag_ by withdrawing the orders for locomotives\r\nfor the Prussian railways from the old Alsatian factory of Grafenstaden\r\nnear Strasbourg.  This was done absolutely without any provocation, and\r\naroused a violent denunciation, not only among the purely German\r\nemployés of the factory and in the newspapers, but also in the\r\n_Landtag_, which adopted an order of the day condemning most severely\r\nthe attitude of the Imperial Government towards {14} Alsace-Lorraine,\r\nof which this boycott measure was a petty and mean illustration.\r\n\r\nThe indignation was at its height when Emperor Wilhelm arrived in\r\nStrasbourg on May 13th.  Instead of acting in a tactful manner and\r\npromising to set right this wrong done to the industrial life of\r\nStrasbourg, the Emperor addressed the following words to the Mayor:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Listen.  Up to here you have known only the good side of me; it is\r\npossible that you will learn the other side of me.  Things cannot\r\ncontinue as they are: if this situation lasts, we shall suppress your\r\nConstitution and annex you to Prussia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis typically Prussian speech, which in a few lines reveals the\r\nhopelessly unsuccessful tactics of the German Government towards the\r\npeoples whom it has tried to assimilate the world over, only served to\r\nincrease the indignation of the inhabitants of the _Reichsland_; in\r\nfact, the repercussion throughout all Germany was very serious.\r\n\r\nThe arbitrary threat of the Emperor was badly received in the other\r\nfederated states, whose newspapers pointed out that he had exceeded his\r\nauthority.  It gave the Socialists an opportunity to attack Emperor\r\nWilhelm on the floor of the _Reichstag_.  Four days after this threat\r\nwas made, an orator of the Socialist party declared\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We salute the imperial words as the confession, full of weight and\r\ncoming from a competent source, that annexation to Prussia is the\r\nheaviest punishment that one can threaten to impose upon a {15} people\r\nfor its resistance against Germany.  It is a punishment like hard\r\nlabour in the penitentiary with loss of civil rights.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis speech caused the Chancellor to leave the room with all the\r\nMinistry.  On May 22d, the attack upon Emperor Wilhelm for his words at\r\nStrasbourg was renewed by another deputy, who declared that if such a\r\nthing had happened in England, \"the English would shut up such a King\r\nat Balmoral or find for him some peaceful castle, such as that of\r\nStemberg or the Villa Allatini at Salonika.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer of the _Landtag_ to Emperor Wilhelm's threat was the passing\r\nof two unanimous votes: one demanding that hereafter the Constitution\r\ncould not be modified except by the law of the country and not by the\r\nlaw of the Empire, and the other demanding for Alsace-Lorraine a\r\nnational flag.\r\n\r\nOne could easily fill many pages with illustrations of senseless\r\npersecutions, most of them of the pettiest character, but some more\r\nserious in nature, which Alsace and Lorraine have had to endure since\r\nthe granting of the Constitution.  Newspapers, illustrated journals,\r\nclubs and organizations of all kinds have been annoyed constantly by\r\npolice interference.  Their editors, artists, and managers have been\r\nbrought frequently into court.  Zislin and Hansi, celebrated\r\ncaricaturists, have found themselves provoked to bolder and bolder\r\ndefiances by successive condemnations, and have endured imprisonment as\r\nwell as fines.  Hansi was sentenced to a year's imprisonment by the\r\nHigh Court of Leipsic only a month {16} before the present war broke\r\nout, and chose exile rather than a Prussian fortress.\r\n\r\nThe greatest effort during the past few years has been made in the\r\nschools to influence the minds of the growing generation against the\r\n\"_souvenir de France_\" and to impress upon the Alsatians what good\r\nfortune had come to them to be born German citizens.\r\n\r\nAmong the boys, the influence of this teaching has been such that over\r\ntwenty-two thousand fled from home during the period of 1900-1913 to\r\nenlist in the Foreign Legion of the French Army.  The campaign of the\r\nGerman newspapers in Alsace-Lorraine, and, in fact, throughout Germany,\r\nwas redoubled in 1911.  Parents were warned of the horrible treatment\r\naccorded to the poor boys who were misguided enough to throw away their\r\ncitizenship, and go to be killed in Africa under the French flag.  The\r\nresult of this campaign was that the Foreign Legion received a larger\r\nnumber of Alsatians in 1912 than had enlisted during a single year\r\nsince 1871!\r\n\r\nAmong the girls, the German educational system flattered itself that it\r\ncould completely change the sentiments of a child, especially in the\r\nboarding-schools.  Last year the Empress of Germany visited a girls'\r\nschool near Metz, which is one of the best German schools in the\r\n_Reichsland_.  As she was leaving, she told the children that she\r\nwanted to give them something.  What did they want?  The answer was not\r\nsweets or cake, but that they might be taught a little French!\r\n\r\n{17}\r\n\r\nSince 1910, the German war budget has carried successively larger items\r\nfor the strengthening of forts and the building of barracks in Metz,\r\nColmar, Mulhouse, Strasbourg, Neuf-Brisach, Bischwiller, Wissembourg,\r\nMohrange, Sarrebourg, Sarreguemines, Saarbruck, Thionville, Molsheim,\r\nand Saverne.  The former French provinces have been flooded with\r\ngarrisons, and have been treated just as they were treated forty years\r\nago.  The insufferable spirit of militarism, and the arrogance of the\r\nPrussian officers in Alsatian towns, have served to turn against the\r\nEmpire many thousands whom another policy might have won.  For it must\r\nbe remembered that by no means all the inhabitants of the _Reichsland_\r\nhave been by birth and by home training French sympathizers.  Instead\r\nof crushing out the \"_souvenir de France_,\" the Prussian civil and\r\nmilitary officials have caused it to be born in many a soul which was\r\nby nature German.\r\n\r\nThe most notorious instance of military arrogance occurred in the\r\nautumn of 1913 in Saverne.  Lieutenant von Forstner, who was passing in\r\nreview cases of discipline, had before him a soldier who had stabbed an\r\nAlsatian, and had been sentenced to two months' imprisonment.  \"Two\r\nmonths on account of an Alsatian blackguard!\" he cried.  \"I would have\r\ngiven you ten marks for your trouble.\"  The story spread, and the town,\r\ntired of the attitude of its garrison, began in turn to show its\r\ncontempt for the Kaiser's soldiers.  Windows in von Forstner's house\r\nwere broken.  Every time officers or soldiers appeared on the streets\r\nthey were hooted.  Saverne {18} was put under martial law.  Threats\r\nwere made to fire upon the citizens.  One day Lieutenant von Forstner\r\nstruck a lame shoemaker across the forehead with his sword.  The affair\r\nhad gone so far that public sentiment in Germany demanded some action.\r\nInstead of adequately punishing von Forstner and other officers, who\r\nhad so maddened the civil population against them, the German military\r\nauthorities gave the guilty officers nominal sentences, and withdrew\r\nthe garrison.\r\n\r\nAll these events had a tremendous repercussion in France.  It is\r\nimpossible to exaggerate the ill-feeling aroused on both sides of the\r\nRhine, in Germany, in Alsace-Lorraine, and in France by the\r\npersecutions in the _Reichsland_.  Only one who knows intimately the\r\nFrench can appreciate their feeling--or share it--over the Zislin and\r\nHansi trials, the Saverne affair, the suppression of the _Souvenir\r\nFrançais_, the _Lorraine Sportive_ and other organizations, and the\r\ncampaign against the Foreign Legion.  It has given the French soldiers\r\nin the present war something to fight for which is as sacred to them as\r\nthe defence of French soil.  The power of this sentiment is indicated\r\nby the invasion of Alsace, the battle of Altkirk, and the occupation of\r\nMulhouse at the beginning of August.  The French could not be held back\r\nfrom this wild dash.  Strategy was powerless in the face of the\r\nsentiment of a _national_ army.\r\n\r\nThe Alsatian leaders themselves have seen the peril to the peace of\r\nEurope of the German attitude towards their country.  They did not want\r\nFrance drawn into a war for their liberation.  They were {19} alarmed\r\nover the possibility of this, and desired it to be understood that\r\ntheir agitation had nothing international in it.  The attitude of all\r\nthe anti-Prussian parties may be summed up in the words of Herr Wolff,\r\nleader of the Government Liberal party, who declared that \"all the\r\ninhabitants of the _Reichsland_ had as their political ambition was\r\nonly the elevation of Alsace-Lorraine to the rank of an independent and\r\nfederated state, like the other twenty-five component parts of the\r\nGerman Empire.\"  Their sincerity and their desire to preserve peace is\r\nproved by the motion presented by the leaders of four of the political\r\ngroups in the _Reichsland_, which was voted on May 6, 1912, without\r\ndiscussion, by the _Landtag_:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Chamber invites the _Statthalter_ to instruct the representatives\r\nof Alsace-Lorraine in the _Bundesrath_ to use all the force they\r\npossess against the idea of a war between Germany and France, and to\r\ninfluence the _Bundesrath_ to examine the ways which might possibly\r\nlead to a _rapprochement_ between France and Germany, which\r\n_rapprochement_ will furnish the means of putting an end to the race of\r\narmaments.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mismanagement of the _Reichsland_ has done more than prevent the\r\nharmonious union of the former French provinces with Germany.  It has\r\nhad an effect, the influence of which cannot be exaggerated, upon\r\nnourishing the hopes of revenge of France, and the resentment against\r\nthe amputation of 1870.  On neither side of the Vosges has the wound\r\nhealed.  The same folly which has kept alive a Polish question in\r\neastern Prussia for one hundred {20} and twenty-five years, has not\r\nfailed to make impossible the prussianizing of Alsace and Lorraine.\r\nThe Prussian has never understood how to win the confidence of others.\r\nThere has been no Rome in his political vision.  As for conceptions of\r\ntoleration, of kindness, and of love, they are non-existent in Prussian\r\nofficialdom.  Nietzsche revealed the character of the Prussian in his\r\ndevelopment of the idea of the _übermensch_.  The ideal of perfect\r\nmanhood is the imposition of one will on another will by force.  Mercy\r\nand pity, according to Nietzsche, were signs of weakness, the symbols\r\nof the slave.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, then, we are compelled after forty-five years\r\nto revise our estimate of Bismarck's sagacity.  His genius was limited\r\nby the narrow horizon of his own age.  He did not see that the future\r\nGermany needed other things that France could give far more than she\r\nneeded Alsace and Lorraine.  In posterity, Bismarck would have had a\r\ngreater place had he, in the last minutes of the transactions at\r\nVersailles, given back Alsace and Lorraine to France, waived the war\r\nindemnity, and asked in return Algeria or other French colonies.\r\n\r\nBut would it have been different under Germany in the French colonies?\r\nA Herrero, employed in the Johannesburg mines, wrote his brother in\r\nGerman South-West Africa: \"The country of the English is truly a good\r\ncountry.  Even if your superior is present, he doesn't strike you, and\r\nif he strikes you and goes thus beyond legal limits, he is punished\r\nlike anyone else.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{21}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE \"WELTPOLITIK\" OF GERMANY\r\n\r\nWhen the transrhenane provinces of the old German Empire were added to\r\nFrance in the eighteenth century, the assimilation of these territories\r\nwas a far different proposition from their refusion into the mould of a\r\nnew German Empire in 1871.  In the first place, the old German Empire\r\nwas a mediæval institution which, in the evolution of modern Europe,\r\nwas decaying.  Alsace and Lorraine were not taken away from a political\r\norganism of which they were a vital part.  The ties severed were purely\r\ndynastic.  In the second place, the consciousness of national life was\r\nawakened in Alsace and Lorraine during the time that they were under\r\nFrench rule, and because they shared in the great movement of the birth\r\nof democracy following the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nFrance, then, by the Treaty of Frankfort, believed that she had been\r\nrobbed of a portion of her national territory.  The people of the\r\nannexed provinces, as was clearly shown by the statement of their\r\nrepresentatives at Bordeaux, did not desire to enter the German\r\nConfederation.\r\n\r\n{22}\r\n\r\nGermany failed to do the only thing that could possibly have made her\r\nnew territories an integral part of the new Empire, _i.e._ to place\r\nAlsace-Lorraine upon a footing of equality with the other states of the\r\nConfederation, and make their entry that of an autonomous sovereign\r\nstate.  Consequently, neither in France nor in the _Reichsland_ was the\r\nTreaty of Frankfort accepted as a permanent change in the map of\r\nEurope.  Germany has always been compelled, in her international\r\npolitics, to count upon the possibility of France making an attempt to\r\nwin back the lost provinces.  She has sought to form alliances to\r\nstrengthen her own position in Europe, and to keep France weak.\r\nFrance, the continued object of German hostility, has found herself\r\ncompelled to ally herself with Russia, with whom she has never had\r\nanything in common, and to compound her colonial rivalries in Africa\r\nwith her hereditary enemy, Great Britain.  This is the first cause of\r\nthe unrest in Europe that has culminated in a general European war.\r\n\r\nThe second cause is the _Weltpolitik_ of Germany which has brought the\r\nGerman Empire into conflict with Great Britain and France outside of\r\nEurope, and with Russia in Europe.\r\n\r\nOn the map of Europe, Russia, Great Britain, and France are, in 1914,\r\npractically what they were in 1815.  The changes, logical and in\r\naccordance with the spirit of centralization of the nineteenth century,\r\nhave transformed middle and south-eastern Europe.  The changes in\r\nsouth-eastern Europe have been effected at the expense of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire, and {23} have been a gradual development throughout the\r\ncentury, from the outbreak of the Greek revolution in 1822 to the\r\nTreaty of London in 1913.  In middle Europe, during the twelve years\r\nbetween 1859 and 1871, the three Powers whose national unity, racially\r\nas well as politically, was already achieved at the time of the\r\nCongress of Vienna, were brought face to face with three new Powers,\r\nunited Germany, united Italy, and the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century has been called the age of European\r\ncolonization.  Europe began to follow its commerce with other\r\ncontinents by the imposition of its civilization and its political\r\nsystem upon weaker races.  Checked by the rising republic of the United\r\nStates from encroaching upon the liberties of the peoples of North and\r\nSouth America, there have been no acquisitions of territory by European\r\nnations in the western continents since the Congress of Vienna.\r\nEuropean expansion directed itself towards Africa, Asia, and the\r\nislands of the oceans.  There was no Oriental nation strong enough to\r\npromulgate a Monroe Doctrine.\r\n\r\nIn extra-European activities, Great Britain, France, and Russia were\r\nthe pioneers.  That they succeeded during the nineteenth century in\r\nplacing under their flag the choicest portions of Africa and the\r\nbackward nations of Asia, was due neither to the superior enterprise\r\nand energy, nor to the greater foresight, of the Anglo-Saxon, French,\r\nand Russian nations.  They had achieved their national unity, and they\r\nwere geographically in a position to take advantage of the great\r\nopportunities which were opening to the world {24} for colonization\r\nsince the development of the steamship and the telegraph.\r\n\r\nBut the other three Powers of Europe came late upon the scene.  It has\r\nonly been within the last quarter of a century that Germany and Italy\r\nhave been in the position to look for overseas possessions.  It has\r\nonly been within the last quarter of a century that Austria, finding\r\nher union with Hungary a durable one, has been able to think of looking\r\nbeyond her limits to play a part, as other nations had long been doing,\r\nin the history of the outside world.\r\n\r\nBy every force of circumstances, the three new States--threatened by\r\ntheir neighbours, who had looked with jealous, though powerless, eyes\r\nupon their consolidation--were brought together into a defensive\r\nalliance.  The Powers of the Triple Alliance drifted into a union of\r\ncommon general aims and ambitions, if not of particular interests,\r\nagainst their three more fortunate rivals, who had been annexing the\r\nbest portions of the Asiatic and African continents while they were\r\nstruggling with internal problems.\r\n\r\nOceans of ink have been wasted upon polemics against the\r\npeace-disturbing character of the Triple Alliance.  Especially has\r\nGermany and her growing _Weltpolitik_ been subject to criticism,\r\ncontinuous and untiring, on the part of the British and French press.\r\nBut the question after all is a very simple one: the three newer Powers\r\nof Europe have not been willing to be content with an application in\r\npractical world politics of the principle that \"to him that hath shall\r\nbe given.\"  Germany and Italy, transformed under {25} modern economic\r\nconditions into industrial states, have been looking for outside\r\nmarkets, and they have wanted to enjoy those markets in regions of the\r\nglobe either actually under their flag or subjected to their political\r\ninfluence.  In other words, they have wanted their share in the\r\ndivision of Africa and Asia into spheres under the control of European\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nIs a logical and legitimate ambition to play a part in the world's\r\npolitics in proportion to one's population, one's wealth, one's\r\nindustrial and maritime activity, necessarily a menace to the world's\r\npeace?  It has always been, and I suppose always will be, in the nature\r\nof those who have, to look with alarm upon the efforts of those who\r\nhave not, to possess something.  Thus capital, irrespective of epoch or\r\nnationality or of religion, has raised the cry of alarm when it has\r\nseen the tendency for betterment, for education, for the development of\r\nideals and a sense of justice on the part of labour.  In just the same\r\nway, Russia with her great path across the northern half of Asia and\r\nher new and steadily growing empire in the Caucasus and central Asia;\r\nFrance with the greater part of northern and central Africa, and an\r\nimportant corner of Asia under her flag; and Great Britain with her\r\nvast territories in every portion of the globe, raised the cry of\r\n\"Wolf, Wolf!\" when the Powers of the Triple Alliance began to look with\r\nenvious eye upon the rich colonies of their neighbours, and to pick up\r\nby clever diplomacy--and brutal force, if you wish--a few crumbs of\r\nwhat was still left for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe result of these alarming ambitions of the {26} Triple Alliance has\r\nbeen the coming together of Russia, France, and England, hereditary\r\nenemies in former days but now friends and allies, in the maintenance\r\nof the colonial \"trust.\"\r\n\r\nThe great cry of the Triple Entente is the maintenance of the European\r\nequilibrium.  For this they have reason.  Europe could know no lasting\r\npeace under Teutonic aggression.  But is there not also to the account\r\nof the Triple Entente some blame for the unrest in Europe and for the\r\ngreat catastrophe which has come upon the world?  For while their\r\npolicy has been the maintenance of the European equilibrium, it has\r\nbeen coupled with the maintenance of an extra-European balance of power\r\nwholly in their favour.\r\n\r\nThe sense of justice, of historical proportion, and the logic of\r\neconomic evolution make one sympathize, in abstract principle, not only\r\nwith the _Weltpolitik_ of Germany, but also with Austria-Hungary's\r\ndesire for an outlet to the sea, and with Italy's longing to have in\r\nthe Mediterranean the position which history and geography indicated\r\nought to be, and might again be, hers.\r\n\r\nBut sympathy in abstract principle is quite another thing from sympathy\r\nin fact.  In order to appreciate the _Weltpolitik_ of Germany, and be\r\nable to form an intelligent opinion in regard to it--_for it is the\r\nmost vital and burning problem in the world to-day_--we must consider\r\nit from the point of view of its _full significance in practice_ in the\r\nhistory of the world.\r\n\r\nBismarck posed as the disinterested \"honest courtier\" of Europe in the\r\nCongress of Berlin.  The declaration he had made, that the whole\r\nquestion {27} of the Orient \"was not worth the finger bone of a\r\nPomeranian grenadier,\" was corroborated by his actions during the\r\nsessions of the Congress.  We have striking illustrations of this in\r\nthe memoirs of Karatheodory pasha, who recorded from day to day, during\r\nthe memorable sessions of the Congress, his astonishment at the\r\nindifference which Bismarck displayed to the nationalities of the\r\nBalkans, and to the complications which might arise in Europe from\r\ntheir rivalries.\r\n\r\nBismarck did not see how vital was to be the Balkan question with the\r\nfuture of the nation he had built.  Nor did he see the intimate\r\nrelationship between the economic progress of united Germany and the\r\nquestion of colonies.  One searches in vain the speeches and writings\r\nof the Iron Chancellor for any reference to the importance of the two\r\nproblems, in seeking the solution of which the fabric of his building\r\nis threatened with destruction.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is easy for us, in looking backwards, to point out the lack\r\nof foresight which was shown by Bismarck in regard to the future of\r\nGermany.  Forty-five years later, we are able to pass in review the\r\nunforeseen developments of international politics and the amazing\r\neconomic evolution of contemporary Europe.  Perhaps it is unreasonable\r\nto expect that much attention and thought should have been given by the\r\nmaker of modern Germany to the possible sphere that Germany might be\r\ncalled upon to play in the world outside of Europe.\r\n\r\nFor we must remember that the new Germany, after the Franco-Prussian\r\nWar, was wholly in an {28} experimental stage, and that the duty at\r\nhand was the immediate consolidation of the various states into a\r\npolitical and economic fabric.  There was enough to demand all the\r\nattention and all the genius of Bismarck and his co-workers in solving\r\nthese problems.  Cordial relationship with Austria had to be\r\nreëstablished.  The dynasties of the south German kingdoms and of the\r\nlesser potentates, whose names still remained legion in spite of the\r\n_Reichsdeputationshauptschluss_ of 1803, had to be carefully handled.\r\nThere were four definite internal problems which confronted Bismarck:\r\nthe relationship of the empire to the Catholic Church; the\r\nreconciliation of the different peoples into a harmonious whole; the\r\nestablishment of representative government without giving the strong\r\nsocialistic elements the upper hand; and the development of the\r\neconomic wealth of Germany.\r\n\r\nThere was little time to think of Germany's place in the world's\r\npolitics.  In foreign affairs, it was considered that the exigencies of\r\nthe moment could be met by adopting a policy of conciliation towards\r\nboth Russia and Austria, and the winning of the friendship of Italy.\r\nThe _Kulturkampf_, the creation of the _Bundesrath_ under Prussian\r\nhegemony, and the formation of the Triple Alliance and the events\r\nconnected with them, are important in an analysis of Germany's\r\ninternational politics.  Unfortunately we cannot bring them into the\r\nscope of this book.  We can mention only the various factors that have\r\nbeen directly responsible for giving birth to what is called the\r\n_Weltpolitik_.\r\n\r\n{29}\r\n\r\nThese factors are the belief of the German people in the superiority of\r\ntheir race and its world-civilizing mission; their connotation of the\r\nword \"German\"; the consciousness of their military strength being\r\ndisproportionate to their political influence; the rapid increase of\r\nthe population and the development of the industrial and commercial\r\nprosperity of the empire; and the realization of the necessity of a\r\nstrong navy, with naval bases and coaling-stations in all parts of the\r\nworld, for the adequate protection of commerce.\r\n\r\n_The belief of the German people in the superiority of their race and\r\nits world-civilizing mission is a sober fact_.  It pervades every class\r\nof society from the Kaiser down to the workingman.  It is heralded from\r\nthe pulpit, taught in the schools, and is a scientific statement in the\r\nwork of many of Germany's leading scholars.  The anthropologist\r\nWoltmann said that \"the German is the superior type of the species\r\n_homo sapiens_, from the physical as well as the intellectual point of\r\nview.\"  Wirth declared that \"the world owes its civilization to Germany\r\nalone\" and that \"the time is near when the earth must inevitably be\r\nconquered by the Germans.\"  The scientific book--a serious one--in\r\nwhich these statements occur was so popular that it sold five editions\r\nin three years!  Paulsen remarked that \"humanity is aware of, and\r\nadmires, the German omnipresence.\"  Hartmann taught that the European\r\nfamily is divided into two races, male and female, of which the first,\r\nof course, was exclusively German, while the second included Latins,\r\nCelts, and Slavs.  \"Marriage is inevitable.\" Goethe expressed in\r\n_Faust_ the opinion that the work {30} of the Germans was to make the\r\nhabitable world worth living in, while Schiller boasted, \"Our language\r\nshall reign over the whole world,\" and that \"the German day lasts until\r\nthe end of time.\"  Schiller also prophesied that \"two empires shall\r\nperish in east and west, I tell you, and it is only the Lutheran faith\r\nwhich shall remain.\"  Fichte, one hundred years ago, exhorted the\r\nGermans to be \"German patriots, and we shall not cease to be\r\ncosmopolitan.\"  Heine believed that \"not only Alsace and Lorraine, but\r\nall France shall be ours.\"\r\n\r\nTo show the German state of mind towards those whom they have not\r\nhesitated to provoke to arms, the remarkable teaching of Hummel's book,\r\nwhich is used in the German primary schools, is a convincing\r\nillustration.  Frenchmen are monkeys, and the best and strongest\r\nelements in the French race asserted to be German by blood.  The\r\nRussians are slaves, as their name implies.  Treitschke's opinion of\r\nthe British is that \"among them love of money has killed all sentiment\r\nof honour and all distinction of just and unjust.  Their setting sun is\r\nour aurora.\"  One of the leading newspapers of Germany recently said:\r\n\"The army of the first line of which Germany will dispose from the\r\nfirst day of the mobilization will be sufficient to crush France, even\r\nif we must detach a part of it against England.  If England enters the\r\nwar, it will be the end of the British Empire, for England is a\r\ncolossus with feet of clay.\"\r\n\r\nThe Kaiser has been the spokesman of the nation in heralding publicly\r\nthe belief in the superiority of the German people, and its world\r\nmission.  It was {31} at the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding\r\nof the Empire that the scope of the _Weltpolitik_ was announced by\r\nWilhelm II.  He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The German Empire has become a world empire (_ein Weltreich_).\r\nEverywhere, in the most distant lands, are established thousands and\r\nthousands of our compatriots.  German science, German activity, the\r\ndefenders of the German ideal pass the ocean.  By thousands of millions\r\nwe count the wealth that Germany transports across the seas.  It is\r\nyour duty, gentlemen, to aid me to establish strong bonds between our\r\nEmpire of Europe and this greater German Empire (_dieses grëssere\r\nDeutsche Reich_) ... May our German Fatherland become one day so\r\npowerful that, as one formerly used to say, _Civis romanus sum_, one\r\nmay in the future need only to say, _Ich bin ein deutscher Burger_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Aix-la-Chapelle, on June 20, 1902, he revealed his ambition in one\r\nsentence, \"_It is to the empire of the world that the German genius\r\naspires_.\"  Just before leaving for the visit to Tangier in 1905--the\r\nvisit which was really the beginning of one of the great issues of the\r\npresent war--he said at Bremen: \"If later one must speak in history of\r\na universal domination by the Hohenzollern, of a universal German\r\nempire, this domination must not be established by military\r\nconquest....  _God has called us to civilize the world: we are the\r\nmissionaries of human progress_.\" This idea was developed further at\r\nMünster, on September 1, 1907, when the Kaiser proclaimed: \"The German\r\npeople will be the block of granite on which our Lord will be able to\r\nelevate and achieve the civilization of the world!\"\r\n\r\n{32}\r\n\r\nThis attitude of mind is as common among the disciples of those\r\nwonderful leaders who founded the international movement for the\r\nsolidarity of interests of labour, as it is among the aristocratic and\r\nintellectual elements of the nation.  The German Socialist has\r\nproclaimed the brotherhood of man, and the common antagonism of the\r\nwage-earners of the world against their capitalistic oppressors.  But,\r\nfor all his preaching, the German Socialist is first of all a German.\r\nHe has come to believe that the mission of Socialism will be best\r\nfulfilled through the triumph of Germanism.  This belief is sincere.\r\nIt is a far cry from Karl Marx to the militant--or rather\r\nmilitarist--German Socialist, bearing arms gladly upon the battlefields\r\nof Europe to-day, because he is inspired by the thought that the\r\ntriumph of the army in which he fights will aid the cause of\r\nSocialism.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] While the _Landtage_ of the German states are mostly controlled by\r\nConservative elements, owing to restricted suffrage, the _Reichstag_ is\r\none of the most intelligently democratic legislative bodies in the\r\nworld.  Its social legislation is surpassed by that of no other\r\ncountry.  During thirty years the Socialist vote in Germany has\r\nincreased one thousand per cent.  It now represents one-third of the\r\ntotal electorate.  But the Socialists are to a man behind the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a striking analogy between the German Socialist of the present\r\ngeneration and the Jacobins of 1793.  The heralders of _Liberté,\r\nEgalité et Fraternité_ fought for the spread of the principles of the\r\nRevolution through God's chosen instruments, the armies of France, and\r\nwere carried away by their enthusiasm until they became the facile\r\nagents for saddling Europe with the tyranny of Napoleon.  Love for {33}\r\nhumanity was turned into blood-lust, and fighting for freedom into\r\nseeking for booty and glory.  Are the profound thinkers of the German\r\nuniversities, and the visionaries of the workingmen's forums following\r\nto-day the same path?  Does the propagation of an ideal lead inevitably\r\nto a blind fanaticism, where the dreamer becomes in his own imagination\r\na chosen instrument of God to shed blood?\r\n\r\nThere is undoubtedly an intellectual and idealistic basis to German\r\nmilitarism and to German arrogance.\r\n\r\n_Their connotation of the word_ \"_German_\" has led the Germans to look\r\nupon territories outside of their political confines as historically\r\nand racially, hence rightfully, virtually, and eventually theirs.  A\r\ngeography now in its two hundred and forty-fifth edition in the public\r\nschools (Daniel's _Leitfaden der Geographie_) states that \"Germany is\r\nthe heart of Europe.  Around it extend Austria, Switzerland, Belgium,\r\nLuxemburg, and Holland, which were all formerly part of the same state,\r\nand are peopled entirely or in the majority by Germans.\"\r\n\r\nWhen German children have been for the past generation deliberately\r\ntaught as a matter of fact--not as an academic or debatable\r\nquestion--that _Deutschland_ ought to be more than it is, we can\r\nunderstand how the neutrality of their smaller neighbours seems to the\r\nGermans a negligible consideration.  No wonder the soldiers who ran up\r\nagainst an implacable enemy at Liège, Namur, and Charleroi thought\r\nthere must be a mistake somewhere, and were more angered against the\r\nopposition of those whom they regarded as their brothers of {34} blood\r\nthan they later showed themselves against the French.  No wonder that\r\nthe sentiment of the whole German nation is for the retention of\r\nBelgium, their path to the sea.  It was formerly German.  Its\r\ninhabitants are German.  Let it become German once more!\r\n\r\nBut to the Germans there are other and equally important elements\r\nbelonging to their nation outside of the states upon the confines of\r\nthe empire.  These are the German emigrants and German colonists in all\r\nportions of the world.  In recent years there has come to the front\r\nmore than ever the theory that _German nationality cannot be lost by\r\nforeign residence or by transference of allegiance to another State:\r\nonce a German, always a German_.\r\n\r\nConvincing proof of this is found in the new citizenship law,\r\nsanctioned with practical unanimity by the _Reichstag_ and\r\n_Bundesrath_, which went into effect on January 1, 1914.  According to\r\nArticle XIII of this law, \"a former German who has not taken up his\r\nresidence in Germany may on application be naturalized.\"  This applies\r\nalso _to one who is descended from a former German, or who has been\r\nadopted as the child of such_!  According to Article XIV, any former\r\nGerman who holds a position in the German Empire in any part of the\r\nworld, in the service of a German religious society or of a German\r\nschool, is looked upon as a German citizen \"by assumption.\"  Any\r\nforeigner holding such a position may be naturalized without having a\r\nlegal residence in Germany.  The most interesting provision of all is\r\nin Article XXV, section 2 of which says: \"Citizenship is not lost by\r\n{35} one who before acquiring foreign citizenship has secured on\r\napplication the written consent of the competent authorities of his\r\nhome state to retain his citizenship.\"\r\n\r\nGermany allows anyone of German blood to become a German citizen, even\r\nif he has never seen Germany and has no intention of taking up his\r\nresidence there; and Germans, who have emigrated to other countries,\r\nsecure the amazing opportunity to acquire foreign citizenship without\r\nlosing their German citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe result of this law, since the war broke out, has been to place a\r\nnatural and justifiable suspicion upon all Germans living in the\r\ncountries of the enemies of Germany.  It is impossible to overestimate\r\nthe peril from the secret ill-will and espionage of Germans residing in\r\nthe countries that are at war with Germany.  There are undoubtedly many\r\nthousands of cases where Germans have been honest and sincere in their\r\nchange of allegiance, but how are the nations where they have become\r\nnaturalized to be sure of this?  A legal means has been given to these\r\nnaturalized Germans to retain, _without the knowledge of the nation\r\nwhere their oath of allegiance has been received in good faith_,\r\ncitizenship in Germany.\r\n\r\nGerman emigration and colonization societies, and many seemingly purely\r\nreligious organizations for \"the propagation of the faith in foreign\r\nlands,\" have been untiring in their efforts to preserve in the minds of\r\nGermans who have left the Fatherland the principle, \"once a German\r\nalways a German.\"  The Catholic as well as the Lutheran Church has lent\r\n{36} itself to this effort.  Wherever there are Germans, one finds the\r\nGerman church, the German school, the _Zeitung_, the _Bierhalle_, and\r\nthe _Turnverein_.  The Deutschtum is sacred to the Germans.  One cannot\r\nbut have the deepest respect for the pride of Germans in their\r\nancestry, in their language, in their church, and in the preservation\r\nof traditional customs.  There is no better blood in the world than\r\nGerman blood, and one who has it in his veins may well be proud of it:\r\nfor it is an inheritance which is distinctly to a man's intellectual\r\nand physical advantage.  But, in recent years, the effort has been made\r\nto confuse _Deutschtum_ with _Deutschland_.  Here lies a great danger.\r\nWe may admire and reverence all that has come to us from Germany.  But\r\nthe world cannot look on impassively at a propaganda which is leading\r\nto _Deutschland über alles!_\r\n\r\nWhen we take the megalomania of the Germans, their ambition to fulfil\r\ntheir world mission, their belief in their peculiar fitness to fulfil\r\nthat mission, and their idea of the German character of the\r\nneighbouring states, and contrast the dream with the reality, we see\r\nhow they must feel, _especially as they are conscious of the fact that\r\nthey dispose of a military strength disproportionate to their position\r\nin mondial politics_.  Great Britain, with one-third less population,\r\n\"the colossus with the feet of clay,\" owns a good fourth of the whole\r\nworld; France, the nation of \"monkeys,\" which was easily crushed in\r\n1870, holds sway over untold millions of acres and natives in Africa\r\nand Asia; while Russia, the nation of \"slaves,\" has a half of Europe\r\nand Asia.\r\n\r\n{37}\r\n\r\nThe most civilized people in the world, with a world mission to fulfil,\r\nis dispossessed by its rivals of inferior races _and of inferior\r\nmilitary strength_!  The thinking German is by the very nature of\r\nthings a militarist.\r\n\r\nBut even if the _logic_ of the _Weltpolitik_, under the force of\r\ncircumstances, did not push the German of every class and category to\r\nthe belief that Germany must solve her great problems of the present\r\nday by force of arms, especially since her military strength is so much\r\ngreater than that of her rivals, the nature of the German would make\r\nhim lean towards force as the decisive argument in the question of\r\nextending his influence.  For from the beginning of history the\r\n_German_ has been a _war man_.  He has asserted himself by force.  He\r\nhas proved less amenable to the refining and softening influences of\r\nChristianity and civilization than any other European race.  He has\r\nworshipped force, and relied wholly upon force to dominate those with\r\nwhom he has come into contact.  The leopard cannot change his spots.\r\nSo it is as natural for the German of the twentieth century to use the\r\nsword as an argument as it was for the German of the tenth century, or,\r\nindeed, of the first century.  We cannot too strongly insist upon this\r\nfatal tendency of the German to subordinate natural, moral, legal, and\r\ntechnical rights to the supremacy of brute force.  There is no\r\nconception of what is called \"moral suasion\" in the German mind.\r\nAlthough some of the greatest thinkers of the world have been and are\r\nto-day Germans, yet the German nation has never come to the realization\r\nthat the pen {38} may be mightier than the sword.  Give the German a\r\npen, and he will hold the world in admiration of his intellect.  Give\r\nhim a piano or a violin, and he will hold the world in adoration of his\r\nsoul.  But give him a sword, and he will hold the world in abhorrence\r\nof his force.  For there never was an _übermensch_ who was not a devil.\r\nElse he would be God.\r\n\r\nBut the _Weltpolitik_ has had other and more tangible and substantial\r\ncauses than the three we have been considering.  It is not wholly the\r\nresult of the German idea that Germany can impose her will upon the\r\nworld and has the right to do so.  The power of Germany comes from the\r\nfact that her people have been workers as well as dreamers.  _The rapid\r\nincrease of the population and development of the industrial and\r\ncommercial prosperity of the empire_ have given the Germans a wholly\r\njustifiable economic foundation for their _Weltpolitik_.\r\n\r\nUnited Germany, after the successful war of 1870, began the greatest\r\nera of industrial growth and prosperity that has ever been known in the\r\nhistory of the world.  Not even the United States, with all its annual\r\nimmigration and opening up of new fields and territories, has been able\r\nto show an industrial growth comparable to that of Germany during the\r\npast forty years.  In this old central Europe cities have grown almost\r\nover night.  Railways have been laid down, one after the other, until\r\nthe whole empire is a network of steel.  Mines and factories have\r\nsprung into being as miraculously as if it had been by the rubbing of\r\nAladdin's lamp.  The population has increased more than half in forty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n{39}\r\n\r\nIt was as her population and her productive power increased far more\r\nquickly and far beyond that of her neighbours, that Germany began to\r\nlook out into the extra-European world for markets.  She had reached\r\nthe point when her productivity, in manufacturing lines, had exceeded\r\nher power of consumption.  Where find markets for the goods?  German\r\nmerchants, and not Prussian militarists, began to spread abroad in\r\nGermany the idea that there was a world equilibrium, as important to\r\nthe future of the nations of Europe as was the European equilibrium.\r\nGermany, looking out over the world, saw that the prosperity of Great\r\nBritain was due to her trade, and that the security and volume of this\r\ntrade were due to her colonies.\r\n\r\nWho does not remember the remarkable stamp issued by the Dominion of\r\nCanada to celebrate the Jubilee of Queen Victoria?  On the mercatorial\r\nprojection of the world, the British possessions were given in red.\r\nOne could not find any corner of the globe where there were not ports\r\nto which British ships in transit could go, and friendly markets for\r\nBritish commerce.  The Germans began to compare their industries with\r\nthose of Great Britain.  Their population was larger than that of the\r\ngreat colonial power, and was increasing more rapidly.  Their\r\nindustries were growing apace.  For their excess population, emigration\r\nto a foreign country meant annual loss of energetic and capable\r\ncompatriots.  Commerce had to meet unfair competition in every part of\r\nthe world.  Outside of the Baltic and North Seas, there was no place\r\nthat a {40} German ship could touch over which the German flag waved.\r\n\r\nIt was not militarism or chauvinism or megalomania, but the natural\r\ndesire of a people who found themselves becoming prosperous to put\r\nsecure and solid foundations under that prosperity, that made the\r\nGermans seek for colonies and launch forth upon the _Weltpolitik_.\r\n\r\nThe first instance of the awakening on the part of the German people to\r\na sense that there was something which interested them outside of\r\nEurope, was the annexation by Great Britain in 1874 of the Fiji\r\nIslands, with which German traders had just begun, at great risk and\r\npainstaking efforts, to build up a business.  This was the time when\r\nthe Government was engaged in its struggles with the Church and\r\nsocialism, and when the working of the _Reichstag_ and the _Bundesrath_\r\nwas still in an experimental stage.  Nothing could be done.  _But there\r\nbegan to be a feeling among Germans that in the future Germany ought to\r\nbe consulted concerning the further extension of the sovereignty of a\r\nEuropean nation over any part of the world then unoccupied or still\r\nindependent_.  But Germany was not in a position either to translate\r\nthis sentiment into a vigorous foreign policy, or to begin to seize her\r\nshare of the world by taking the portions which Great Britain and\r\nRussia and France had still left vacant.\r\n\r\nGerman trade, still in its infancy, received cruel setbacks by the\r\nBritish occupation of Cyprus in 1878 and of Egypt in 1883, the French\r\noccupation of Tunis in 1881, and the Russian and British dealings {41}\r\nwith central Asia and Afghanistan.  The sentiment of the educated and\r\nmoneyed classes in Germany began to impose upon the Government the\r\nnecessity of entering the colonial field.  The action in Egypt and in\r\nTunis brought about the beginning of German colonization.  Bismarck had\r\njust finished successfully his critical struggle with the socialists.\r\nThe decks were cleared for action.  In 1882, a Bremen trader, Herr\r\nLüdritz, by treaties with the native chiefs, gained the Bay of\r\nAngra-Pequena on the west coast of Africa.  For two years no attention\r\nwas paid to this treaty, which was a purely private commercial affair.\r\nIn 1884, shortly after the occupation of Egypt, a dispute arose between\r\nthe British authorities at Cape Town and Herr Lüdritz.  Bismarck saw\r\nthat he must act, or the old story of extension of British sovereignty\r\nwould be repeated.  He telegraphed to the German Consul at Cape Town\r\nthat the Imperial Government had annexed the coast and _hinterland_\r\nfrom the Orange River to Cape Frio.\r\n\r\nOther annexations in Africa and the Pacific followed in the years\r\n1884-1886.  In Africa, the German flag was hoisted over the east coast\r\nof the continent, north of Cape Delgado and the river Rovuma, and in\r\nKamerun and Togo on the Gulf of Guinea.  In the Pacific, Kaiser\r\nWilhelm's Land was formed of a portion of New Guinea, with some\r\nadjacent islands, and the Bismarck Archipelago, the Solomon Islands,\r\nand the Marshall Islands were gathered in.  Since those early years of\r\nfeverish activity, there have been no new acquisitions in Africa, other\r\nthan the portion of French Congo ceded {42} in 1912 as \"compensation\"\r\nfor the French protectorate of Morocco.  In the Pacific, in 1899, after\r\nthe American conquest of the Philippines, the Caroline, Pelew, and\r\nMarianne groups and two of the Samoan Islands were added.\r\n\r\nIn China, Germany believed that she had the right to expect to gain a\r\nposition equal to that of Great Britain at Hongkong and Shanghai, of\r\nFrance at Tonkin, and Russia in Manchuria.  She believed that it was\r\njust as necessary for her to have a fortified port to serve as a naval\r\nbase for her fleet as it was for the other Powers, and that by a\r\npossession of territory which could be called her own she would be best\r\nable to get her share of the commerce of the Far East.  From 1895 to\r\n1897, Germany examined carefully all the possible places which would\r\nserve best for the establishment of a naval and commercial base.  At\r\nthe beginning of 1897, after naval and commercial missions had made\r\ntheir reports, a technical mission was sent out whose membership\r\nincluded the famous Franzius, the creator of Kiel.  This mission\r\nreported in favour of Kiau-Chau on the peninsula of Shantung in north\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nWhen negotiations were opened with the Chinese, the answer of the\r\nChinese Government was to send soldiers to guard the bay!  The Kaiser,\r\nin a visit to the Czar at Peterhof in the summer of 1897, secured\r\nRussian \"benevolent neutrality.\"  The murder of two missionaries in the\r\ninterior of the province, on November 1st of the same year, gave\r\nGermany her chance.  Three German war vessels landed troops on the\r\npeninsula, and seized Kiau-Chau and Tsing-Tau.  {43} After five months\r\nof tortuous negotiations, a treaty was concluded between Germany and\r\nChina on March 6, 1899.  Kiau-Chau with adjacent territory was leased\r\nto Germany for ninety-nine years.  To German capital and German\r\ncommerce were given the right of preference for every industrial\r\nenterprise on the peninsula, the concession for the immediate\r\nconstruction of a railway, and the exclusive right to mining along the\r\nline of the railway.  Thus the greater part of the province of Shantung\r\npassed under the economic influence of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe entry of Japan into the war of 1914 is due to her desire to remedy\r\na great injustice which has been done to Japanese commerce in the\r\nprovince of Shantung by the German occupation, to her fear of this\r\nnaval base opposite her coast (just as she feared Port Arthur), and\r\nprobably to the intention of occupying the Marianne Islands, the\r\nMarshall Islands, and the Eastern and Western Carolines, in order that\r\nthe Japanese navy may have important bases in a possible future\r\nconflict with the United States.\r\n\r\nWhen Germany leased Kiau-Chau, she declared solemnly that the port of\r\nTsing-Tau would be an open port, _ein frei Hafen für allen Nationen_.\r\nBut Japanese trade competition soon caused her to go back on her word.\r\nShe conceived a clever scheme in 1906, by which the Chinese customs\r\nduties were allowed to be collected within the Protectorate in return\r\nfor an annual sum of twenty per cent. upon the entire customs receipts\r\nof the Tsing-Tau district.  In this way, she is more than recompensed\r\nfor the generosity displayed in allowing German goods to {44} be\r\nsubject to the Chinese customs.  She reimburses herself at the expense\r\nof the Japanese!  Berlin could not have been astonished at the\r\nultimatum of August 15th from Tokio.\r\n\r\nThere has always been much opposition in Germany to the colonization\r\npolicy of the Government, the dissatisfaction over the poor success of\r\nthe attempts at African colonization led Chancellor Caprivi to state\r\nthat the worst blow an enemy could give him was to force upon him more\r\nterritories in Africa!  The Germans never got on well with the negroes.\r\nTheir colonists, for the most part too poor to finance properly\r\nagricultural schemes, lived by trading.  Like all whites, they cheated\r\nthe natives and bullied them into giving up their lands.  In South-West\r\nAfrica, a formidable uprising of the Herreros resulted in the massacre\r\nof all the Germans except the missionaries and the colonists who had\r\nestablished themselves there before the German occupation.  The\r\nsuppression of this rebellion took more than a year, and cost Germany\r\nan appalling sum in money and many lives.  But it cost the natives\r\nmore.  Two thirds of the nation of the Herreros were massacred: while\r\nonly six or seven thousand were in arms, the German official report\r\nstated that forty thousand were killed.  The Germans confiscated all\r\nthe lands of the natives.\r\n\r\nIn 1906, after twenty-one years of German rule, there were in\r\nSouth-West Africa sixteen thousand prisoners of war out of a total\r\nnative population of thirty-one thousand.  All the natives lived in\r\nconcentration camps, and were forced to work for the {45} Government.\r\nIn commenting upon the Herrero campaign, Pastor Frenssen, one of the\r\nmost brilliant writers of modern Germany, put in the mouth of the hero\r\nof his colonial novel the following words: \"God has given us the\r\nvictory because we were the most noble race, and the most filled with\r\ninitiative.  That is not saying much, when we compare ourselves with\r\nthis race of negroes; but we must act in such a way as to become better\r\nand more active than all the other people of the world.  It is to the\r\nmost noble, to the most firm that the world belongs.  Such is the\r\njustice of God.\"\r\n\r\nGerman opposition has been bitter also against the occupation of\r\nKiau-Chau.  For traders have claimed that the _political_ presence of\r\nGermany on the Shantung peninsula and the dealings of the German\r\ndiplomats with the Pekin court had so prejudiced the Chinese against\r\neverything German that it was harder to do business with them than\r\nbefore the leasehold was granted.  They actually advocated the\r\nwithdrawal of the protectorate for the good of German commerce!\r\n\r\nBut German pride was at stake in Africa after the Herrero rebellion.\r\nAnd in China, Kiau-Chau was too valuable a naval base to give up.  In\r\n1907, a ministry of colonies was added to the Imperial Cabinet.  Since\r\nthen the colonial realm has been considered an integral part of the\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nAt every point of this colonial development, Germany found herself\r\nconfronted with open opposition and secret intrigue.  The principal\r\nstrategic value of south-west Africa was taken away by the {46} British\r\npossession of Walfisch Bay, and of east Africa by the protectorate\r\nconsented to by the Sultan of Zanzibar to the British Crown.  Togoland\r\nand Kamerun are hemmed in by French and British possession of the\r\n_hinterland_.  The Pacific islands are mostly \"left-overs,\" or of minor\r\nimportance.  In spite of the unpromising character of these colonies,\r\nthe commerce of Germany with them increased from 1908 to 1912 five\r\nhundred per cent., and the commerce with China through Kiau-Chau from\r\n1902 to 1912 nearly a thousand per cent.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, in comparison to her energies and her willingness--let us\r\nleave till later the question of ability and fitness--Germany has had\r\nlittle opportunity to exercise a colonial administration on a large\r\nscale.  She must seek to extend her political influence over new\r\nterritories.  Where and how?  That has been the question.  Most\r\npromising of all appeared the succession to the Portuguese colonies,\r\nfor the sharing of which Great Britain declared her willingness to meet\r\nGermany halfway.  An accord was made in 1898, against the eventuality\r\nof Portugal selling her colonies.  But since the Republic was\r\nproclaimed in Portugal, there has been little hope that her new\r\nGovernment would consider itself strong enough to part with the\r\nheritage of several centuries.\r\n\r\nFor the increase of her colonial empire, Germany has felt little hope.\r\nSo she has tried to secure commercial privileges in various parts of\r\nthe world, through which political control might eventually come.  We\r\nhave already spoken of her effort in {47} China.  Separate chapters\r\ntreat of her efforts in the three Moslem countries, Morocco, Persia,\r\nand Turkey, and show how in each case she has found herself checkmated\r\nby the intrigues and accords of the three rich colonial Powers.\r\n\r\nLong before the political union of the German States in Europe was\r\naccomplished, there were German aspirations in regard to the New World,\r\nwhen Pan-Germanists dreamed of forming states in North and South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThese enthusiasts did not see that the Civil War had so brought\r\ntogether the various elements of the United States, the most prominent\r\nand most loyal of which was the German element, that any hope of a\r\nseparatist movement in the United States was chimerical.  As late as\r\n1885, however, the third edition of Roscher's _Kolonien,\r\nKolonialpolitik und Auswanderung_ stated that \"it would be a great step\r\nforward, if the German immigrants to North America would be willing to\r\nconcentrate themselves in one of the states, and transform it into a\r\nGerman state.\"  For different reasons Wisconsin would appear to be most\r\nparticularly indicated.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1849, the Germans commenced to organize emigration to\r\nBrazil through a private society of Hamburg (_Hamburger\r\nKolonisationverein_), which bought from the Prince de Joinville,\r\nbrother-in-law of Dom Pedro, vast territories in the state of Santa\r\nCatharina.  There the German colonization in Brazil began.  It soon\r\nextended to the neighbouring states of Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul.\r\nThere are now about three hundred and fifty thousand {48} Germans,\r\nforming two per cent. of the population.  In no district are they more\r\nthan fifteen per cent.  However, in Rio Grande, there is a territory of\r\ntwo hundred kilometres in which the German language is almost wholly\r\nspoken; and a chain of German colonies binds Sao Leopoldo to Santa Cruz.\r\n\r\nAmong the Pan-Germanists, the three states of southern Brazil have been\r\nregarded as a zone particularly reserved for German expansion.  The\r\ncolonial congress of 1902 at Berlin expressed a formal desire that\r\nhereafter German emigration be directed towards the south of Brazil.\r\nAn amendment to include Argentina was rejected.  The decree of Prussia,\r\nforbidding emigration to Brazil, was revoked in 1896 in so far as it\r\nwas a question of the three states of Paraná, Santa Catharina, and Rio\r\nGrande do Sul.\r\n\r\nIt has not been very many years since diplomatic incidents arose\r\nbetween Brazil and Germany over fancied German violation of Brazilian\r\nterritory by the arrest of sailors on shore.  But Germany has not\r\nentertained serious hope of getting a foothold in South America.\r\nBrazil has increased greatly in strength, and there is to-day in South\r\nAmerica a tacit alliance between Argentina, Brazil, and Chile to\r\nsupport the American Monroe Doctrine.  Germany found, when she was\r\ntrying to buy a West India island from Denmark, that she had to reckon\r\nnot only with Washington, but also with Buenos Ayres, Rio, and Santiago.\r\n\r\nFinding herself so thoroughly hemmed in on all sides, in the New World\r\nand in the Old World, by alliances and accords directed against her\r\noverseas {49} political expansion, modern Germany has repeated the\r\nhistory of the Jews.  Deprived of some senses, one develops\r\nextraordinarily others.  Deprived of civil and social rights for\r\ncenturies, the Jews developed the business sense until to-day their\r\nwealth and influence in the business world are far beyond the\r\nproportionate numbers of their race.  Deprived of the opportunity to\r\nadminister and develop vast overseas territories, the Germans have\r\nturned to intensive military development at home and extensive\r\ncommercial development abroad, until to-day they are the foremost\r\nmilitary Power in Europe, and are threatening British commercial\r\nsupremacy in every part of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe German counterpart of the British and French and Russian elements\r\nthat are directing the destinies of vast colonies and protectorates is\r\ninvesting its energy in business.  During the past generation, the\r\nGerman campaign for the markets of the world has been carried on by the\r\nbrightest and best minds in Germany.  There have been three phases to\r\nthis campaign: manufacturing the goods, selling the goods, and carrying\r\nthe goods.  German manufactures have increased so greatly in volume and\r\nscope since the accession of the present Emperor that there is hardly a\r\nline of merchandise which is not offered in the markets of the world by\r\nGerman firms.\r\n\r\nArticles \"made in Germany\" may not be as well made as those of other\r\ncountries.  But their price is more attractive, and they have driven\r\nother goods from many fields.  One sees this right in Europe in the\r\nmarkets of Germany's competitors and enemies.  {50} Since the present\r\nwar began, French and British patriots are hard put to it sometimes\r\nwhen they find that article after article which they have been\r\naccustomed to buy is German.  In my home in Paris, the elevator is\r\nGerman, electrical fixtures are German, the range in my kitchen is\r\nGerman, the best lamps for lighting are German.  I have discovered\r\nthese things in the past month through endeavouring to have them\r\nrepaired.  Interest led me to investigate other articles in daily use.\r\nMy cutlery is German, my silverware is German, the chairs in my\r\ndining-room are German, the mirror in my bathroom is German, some of my\r\nfood products are German, and practically all the patented drugs and\r\nsome of the toilet preparations are German.\r\n\r\nAll these things have been purchased in the Paris markets, without the\r\nslightest leaning towards, or preference for, articles coming from the\r\nFatherland.  I was not aware of the fact that I was buying German\r\nthings.  They sold themselves,--the old combination of appearance,\r\nconvenience, and price, which will sell anything.\r\n\r\nThat I am unconsciously using German manufactured articles is largely\r\ndue to the genius of the salesman.  It is a great mistake to believe\r\nthat salesmanship is primarily the art of selling the goods of the\r\nhouse you represent.  That has been the British idea.  It is today\r\nexploded.  Is it because the same type as the Britisher who is devoting\r\nhis brains and energy to solving the problems of inferior people in\r\ndifferent parts of the world is among the Germans devoting his energies\r\nto German commerce in those {51} same places, that the Germans have\r\nfound the fine art of salesmanship to be quite a different thing?  It\r\nis studying the desires of the people to whom you intend to sell,\r\nfinding out what they want to buy, and persuading your house at home to\r\nmake and export those articles.  From the Parisian and the Londoner,\r\nand the New Yorker down to the naked savage, the Germans know what is\r\nwanted, and they supply it.  If the British university man is enjoying\r\na position of authority and of fascinating perplexity in some colony,\r\nand feels that he has a share in shaping the destinies of the world,\r\nthe German university man is not without his revenge.  Deprived of one\r\nsense, has he not developed another--and a more practical one?\r\n\r\nThe young German, brought up in an overpopulated country, unable to\r\nenter a civil service which will keep him under his own flag--and\r\nremember how intensely patriotic he is, this young German, just as\r\npatriotic as the young Frenchman or the young Britisher,--must leave\r\nhome.  He is not of the class from which come the voluntary emigrants.\r\nHis ties are all in Germany: his love--and his move--all for Germany.\r\nSo he becomes a German resident abroad, in close connection with the\r\nFatherland, and always working for the interests of the Fatherland.  He\r\ngoes to England or to France, where he studies carefully and\r\nmethodically, as if he were to write a thesis on it (and he often\r\ndoes), the business methods of and the business opportunities among the\r\npeople where he is dwelling.  He is giving his life to put _Deutschland\r\nüber alles_ in business right in the {52} heart of the rival nation,\r\n_and he is succeeding_.  During October, 1914, when they tried to\r\narrest in the larger cities of England the German and Austrian subjects\r\nthey had to stop--there was not room in the jails for all of them!  And\r\nin many places business was paralyzed.\r\n\r\nIn carrying the products of steadily increasing volume to steadily\r\ngrowing markets, Germany has been sensible enough to make those markets\r\npay for the cost of transport.  Up to the very selling price, all the\r\nmoney goes to Germany.  The process is simple: from German factories,\r\nby German ships, through German salesmen, to German firms, in every\r\npart of the world--beginning with London and Paris.\r\n\r\nGermany's merchant marine has kept pace with the development of her\r\nindustry.  Essen may be the expression of one side of modern Germany,\r\nwhich is said to have caused the European war.  But one is more logical\r\nin believing that Hamburg and Bremen and the Kiel Canal have done more\r\nto bring on this war than the products of Krupp.  During the last\r\ntwenty-five years the tonnage of Germany's merchant marine has\r\nincreased two hundred and fifty per cent., a quarter of which _has been\r\nin the last five years, from 1908-1913_.  There are six times as many\r\nsteamships flying the German flag as when Wilhelm II mounted the\r\nthrone.  In merchant ships, Germany stands today second only to Great\r\nBritain.  The larger portion of her merchant marine is directed by\r\ngreat corporations.  The struggle against Great Britain and France for\r\nthe freight carrying of outside nations has been most bitter--and most\r\nsuccessful.  _Before {53} the present war, there was no part of the\r\nworld in which the German flag was not carried by ships less than ten\r\nyears old_.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Kiau-Chau, the colonies of Germany have never\r\nbeen of much practical value, except as possible coaling and wireless\r\nstations for the German fleet.  But here also the opposition of her\r\nrivals has minimized their value.  Walfisch Bay and Zanzibar have, as\r\nwe have already said, lessened the strategical value of the two large\r\ncolonies on either side of the African continent.  In the division of\r\nthe Portuguese colonies agreed to by Great Britain, it was \"the\r\nmistress of the seas\" who was to have the strategic places--not part of\r\nthem, but all of them, the Cape Verde Islands, Madeira, and the Azores.\r\n\r\nAs Germany's commerce and shipping have so rapidly developed, the\r\nseeking for opportunities to extend her political sovereignty outside\r\nof Europe has not been so much an outlook for industrial enterprise as\r\nthe imperative necessity of finding naval bases and coaling stations in\r\ndifferent parts of the world for the adequate protection of commerce.\r\nThe development of the German navy has been the logical complement of\r\nthe development of the German merchant marine.  Germany's astonishing\r\nnaval program has kept pace with the astonishing growth of the great\r\nHamburg and Bremen lines.  Germany has had exactly the same argument\r\nfor the increase of her navy as has had Great Britain.  Justification\r\nfor the money expended on the British navy is that Great Britain needs\r\nthe navy to protect her commerce, upon which the life of the nation is\r\ndependent, {54} and to guarantee her food-supplies.  The industrial\r\nevolution of Germany has brought about for her practically the same\r\neconomic conditions as in Great Britain.  In addition to the dependence\r\nof her prosperity upon the power of her navy to protect her commerce,\r\nGermany has felt that she must keep the sea open for the sake of\r\nguaranteeing uninterrupted food-supplies for her industrial population.\r\nIt must not be forgotten that Germany is flanked on east and west by\r\nhereditary enemies, and has come to look to the sea as the direction\r\nfrom which her food supplies would come in case of war.\r\n\r\nThis last factor of the _Weltpolitik_, the creation of a strong navy,\r\nmust not be looked upon either as a provocation to Great Britain or as\r\na menace to the equilibrium of the world.  If it has brought Germany\r\ninevitably into conflict with Great Britain, it is because the navy is\r\nthe safeguard of commerce.  The _Weltpolitik_ is essentially a\r\n_Handelspolitik_.  The present tremendous conflict between Great\r\nBritain and Germany is the result of commercial rivalry.  It is more a\r\nquestion of the pocket-book than of the sacredness of treaties, if we\r\nare looking for the cause rather than the occasion of the war.  It has\r\ncome in spite of honest efforts to bring Great Britain and Germany\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nLord Haldane, in February, 1912, made a trip to Berlin to bring about a\r\ngeneral understanding between the two nations.  But while there was\r\nmuch discussion of the question of the Bagdad Railway, Persian and\r\nChinese affairs, Walfisch Bay, and the division of Africa, nothing came\r\nof it.  On March {55} 18th, Mr. Churchill said to the House of Commons:\r\n\"If Germany adds two ships in the next six years, we shall have to add\r\nfour; if Germany adds three, we shall have to add six.  Whatever\r\nreduction is made in the German naval program will probably be followed\r\nhere by a corresponding naval reduction.  The Germans will not get\r\nahead of us, no matter what increase they make; they will not lose, no\r\nmatter what decrease they make.\"  This was as far as Great Britain\r\ncould go.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1912, the British fleet was concentrated in the North\r\nSea, and an accord was made with France for common defensive action in\r\nthe North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.  At the same time, during M.\r\nPoincaré's trip to Petrograd, an accord was signed between France and\r\nRussia for common naval action in time of war.\r\n\r\nThe Pan-Germanic movement in recent years has not been a tool of the\r\nGovernment, but rather a party, including other parties, banded\r\ntogether more than once to oppose the German Government in an\r\nhonourable attempt to preserve peace with the neighbours in the west.\r\n\r\nIt is a tremendous mistake--and a mistake which has been continuously\r\nmade in the French, British, and American press since the beginning of\r\nthe war--to consider the _Weltpolitik_ as an expression of the\r\nsentiments of the German Emperor and his officials.  Since it was\r\nforced upon Bismarck against his will, Pan-Germanism has been a power\r\nagainst which the Emperor William II has had to strive frequently\r\nthroughout his reign.  For it has never hesitated to {56} force him\r\ninto paths and into positions which were perilous to the theory of\r\nmonarchical authority.  The Kaiser has resented the pressure of public\r\nopinion in directing the affairs of the Empire.  Pan-Germanism has been\r\na striking example of democracy, endeavouring to have a say in\r\ngovernmental policies.  The Naval and Army Leagues, the German Colonial\r\nSociety, and the Pan-Germanic Society are private groups, irresponsible\r\nfrom the standpoint of the Government.  They have declared the\r\ngovernmental programs for an increase in armaments insufficient, and\r\nhave bitterly denounced and attacked them from the point of view\r\nexactly opposite to that of the Socialists.  The Pan-Germanic Society\r\nrefused to recognize the treaty concluded between Germany and France\r\nafter the Agadir incident.  Said Herr Klaas at the Hanover Conference\r\non April 15, 1912: \"We persist in considering Morocco as the country\r\nwhich will become in the future, let us hope the near future, the\r\ncolony for German emigration.\" The same intractable spirit was shown in\r\nDr. Pohl's address at the Erfurt Congress in September, 1912.\r\n\r\nWe hear much about the Kaiser and the military party precipitating war.\r\nA review of the German newspapers during the past few years will\r\nconvince any fair-minded reader that German public opinion, standing\r\nconstantly behind the Pan-Germanists, has frequently made the German\r\nForeign Office act with a much higher hand in international questions\r\nthan it would have acted if left to itself, and that German public\r\nopinion, from highest classes to lowest, is for this war to the bitter\r\nfinish.  _It is the war of the {57} people, intelligently and\r\ndeliberately willed by them_.  The statement that a revolution in\r\nGermany, led by the democracy to dethrone the Kaiser or to get him out\r\nof the clutches of the military party, would put an end to the war, is\r\nfoolish and pernicious.  For it leads us to false hopes.  It would be\r\nmuch nearer the truth to say that if the Kaiser had not consented to\r\nthis war, he would have endangered his throne.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the _Weltpolitik_, imposed upon European diplomacy by\r\nthe German nation in the assembling of the Conference of Algeciras, was\r\nthat no State should be allowed to disturb the existing political and\r\nterritorial _status quo_ of any country still free, in any part of the\r\nworld, without the consent of the other Powers.  This _Weltpolitik_\r\nwould have the natural effect, according to Karl Lamprecht, in his _Zur\r\nJüngsten Deutschen Vergangenheit_, of endangering a universal and\r\npitiless competition among the seven Great Powers in which the weakest\r\nwould eventually be eliminated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{58}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE \"BAGDADBAHN\"\r\n\r\nIn the development of her _Weltpolitik_, the most formidable, the most\r\nfeasible, and the most successful conception of modern Germany has been\r\nthe economic penetration of Asiatic Turkey.  She may have failed in\r\nAfrica and in China.  But there can be no doubt about the successful\r\nbeginning, and the rich promise for the future, of German enterprises\r\nin the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\nThe countries of sunshine have always exercised a peculiar fascination\r\nover the German.  His literature is filled with the Mediterranean and\r\nwith Islam.  From his northern climate he has looked southward and\r\neastward back towards the cradle of his race, and in imagination has\r\nlived over again the Crusades.  As long as Italy was under Teutonic\r\npolitical influence, the path to the Mediterranean was easy.  United\r\nItaly and United Germany were born at the same time.  But while the\r\nbirth of Italy threatened to close eventually the trade route to the\r\nMediterranean to Germany, the necessity of a trade route to the south\r\nbecame more vital than ever to the new German Confederation from the\r\nsequences of the union.\r\n\r\n{59}\r\n\r\nWhen her political consolidation was completed and her industrial era\r\ncommenced, Germany began to look around the world for a place to\r\nexpand.  There were still three independent Mohammedan\r\nnations--Morocco, Persia, and Turkey.  In Morocco she found another\r\ncause for conflict with France than Alsace-Lorraine.  In Persia and\r\nTurkey, she faced the bitter rivalry of Russia and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe rapid decline of the Ottoman Empire, and the fact that its\r\nsovereign was Khalif of the Moslem world, led German statesmen to\r\nbelieve that Constantinople was the best place in the world to centre\r\nthe efforts of their diplomacy in the development of the _Weltpolitik_.\r\nThrough allying herself with the Khalif, _Germany would find herself\r\nable to strike eventually at the British occupation of India and Egypt,\r\nand the French occupation of Algeria and Tunis, not only by joining the\r\ninterests of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Germanism, but also by winning a\r\nplace in Morocco opposite Gibraltar, a place in Asia Minor opposite\r\nEgypt, and a place in Mesopotamia opposite India_.\r\n\r\nThe certainty of economic success helped to make the political effort\r\nworth while, even if it came to nothing.  For Asia Minor and\r\nMesopotamia are countries that have been among the most fertile and\r\nprosperous in the whole world.  They could be so again.  The present\r\nbackward condition of Asia Minor and Mesopotamia is due to the fact\r\nthat these countries have had no chance to live since they came under\r\nOttoman control, much less to develop their resources proportionately\r\nto other nations.  The {60} natives have been exploited by the Turkish\r\nofficials and by foreign holders of concessions.  Frequently\r\nconcessions have been sought to stop, not to further, development.  If\r\nthere have been climatic changes to account for lack of fertility in\r\nAsia Minor, this is largely due to deforestation.  Ibn Batutah, the\r\nfamous Moorish traveller of the first half of the fourteenth century,\r\nand Shehabeddin of Damascus, his contemporary, have left glowing\r\naccounts of the fertility and prosperity of regions of Asia Minor, now\r\nhopelessly arid, as they existed on the eve of the foundation of the\r\nOttoman Empire.  Not only have all the trees been cut down, but the\r\nroots have been torn up for fuel!  One frequently sees in the markets\r\nof Anatolian towns the roots of trees for sale.  The treatment of trees\r\nis typical of everything else.  The country has had no chance.  In\r\nMesopotamia, the new irrigation schemes are not innovations of the\r\ntwentieth century, but the revival of methods of culture in vogue\r\nthousands of years before Christ.\r\n\r\nThe Romans and Byzantines improved their inheritance.  The Osmanlis\r\nruined it.\r\n\r\nIn addition to sunshine and romance, political advantages, and\r\nprospects of making money, another influence has attracted the Germans\r\nto the Ottoman Empire.  There is a certain affinity between German and\r\nOsmanli.  The Germans have sympathy with the spirit of Islam, _as they\r\nconceive it to be interpreted_ in the Turk.  They admire the _yassak_\r\nof the Turk, which is the counterpart of their _verboten_.  The von\r\nMoltke who later led Prussia to her great victories had at the\r\nbeginning of his career an intimate knowledge {61} of the Turkish army.\r\nHe admired intensely the blind and passive obedience of the Turk to\r\nauthority, his imperturbability under misfortune and his fortitude in\r\nfacing hardship and danger.  \"Theirs not to reason why: theirs but to\r\ndo and die\" is a spirit which German and Turk understand, and show, far\r\nbetter than Briton, with all due respect to Tennyson.  A Briton may\r\nobey, but he questions all the same, and after the crisis is over he\r\ndemands a reckoning.  Authority, to the Anglo-Saxon, rests in the body\r\npolitic, of which each individual is an integral--and\r\nineffaceable--part.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish military and official cast is like that of the Germans in\r\nthree things: authority rests in superiors unaccountable to those whom\r\nthey command; the origin of authority is force upholding tradition; and\r\nthe sparing of human life and human suffering is a consideration that\r\nmust not be entertained when it is a question of advancing a political\r\nor military end.  I have seen both at work, and have seen the work of\r\nboth; so I have the right to make this statement.  For all that, I have\r\nGerman and Turkish friends, and deep affection for them, and deep\r\nadmiration for many traits of character of both nations.  The trouble\r\nis that the people of Germany and the people of Turkey allow their\r\nofficial and military castes to do what their own instincts would not\r\npermit them to do.  The passivity of the Turk is natural: it is his\r\nreligion, his background, and his climate.  The passivity of the German\r\nis inexcusable.  He will not exorcise the devil out of his own race.\r\nIt must be done for him.\r\n\r\n{62}\r\n\r\nIn 1888, a group of German financiers, backed by the Deutsche Bank,\r\nwhich was to have so powerful a future in Turkey, asked for the\r\nconcession of a railway line from Ismidt to Angora.  The construction\r\nof this line was followed by concessions for extension from Angora to\r\nCæsarea and for a _branch_ from the Ismidt-Angora line going south-west\r\nfrom Eski Sheir to Konia.  The extension to Cæsarea was never made.\r\nThat was not the direction in which the Germans wanted to go.  The Eski\r\nSheir-Konia spur became the main line.  The Berlin-Bagdad-Bassorah \"all\r\nrail route\" was born.  The Germans began to dream of connecting the\r\nBaltic with the Persian Gulf.  The Balkan Peninsula was to revert to\r\nAustria-Hungary, and Asia Minor and Mesopotamia to Germany.  The south\r\nSlavs and the populations of the Ottoman Empire would be dispossessed\r\n(the philosopher Haeckel actually prophesied this in a speech in 1905\r\nbefore the Geographical Society of Jena).  Russia would be cut off from\r\nthe Mediterranean.  This was the Pan-Germanist conception of the\r\n_Bagdadbahn_.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment the first railway concession was granted to Germans in\r\nAsia Minor, which coincided with the year of his accession, Wilhelm II\r\nhas been heart and soul with the development of German interests in the\r\nOttoman Empire.  His first move in foreign politics was to visit Sultan\r\nAbdul Hamid in 1889, when he was throwing off the yoke of Bismarck.\r\nThis visit was the beginning of an intimate connection between\r\nWilhelmstrasse and the Sublime Porte which has never been\r\ninterrupted--excepting {63} for a very brief period at the beginning of\r\nthe First Balkan War.  The friendship between the Sultan and the Kaiser\r\nwas not in the least disturbed by the Armenian massacres.  The\r\nhecatombs of Asia Minor passed without a protest.  In fact, five days\r\nafter the great massacre of August, 1896, in Constantinople, where\r\nTurkish soldiers shot down their fellow-citizens under the eyes of the\r\nSultan and of the foreign ambassadors, Wilhelm II sent to Abdul Hamid\r\nfor his birthday a family photograph of himself with the Empress and\r\nhis children.\r\n\r\nIn 1898, the Kaiser made his second voyage to Constantinople.  This\r\nvoyage was followed by the concession extending the railway from Konia\r\nto the Persian Gulf.  It was the beginning of the _Bagdadbahn_ in the\r\nofficial and narrower sense.  After this visit of the Kaiser to Abdul\r\nHamid, the pilgrimage was continued to the Holy Land.  At Baalbek,\r\nthere is a stone of typically German taste, set in the wall of the\r\ngreat temple, to commemorate the visit of the man who dreamed he would\r\none day be master of the modern world.  If this inscription seems a\r\nsacrilege, what name have we for the large gap in the walls of\r\nJerusalem made for his triumphal entry to the Holy City?  The great\r\nProtestant German Church, whose corner-stone was laid by his father in\r\n1869, was solemnly inaugurated by the Kaiser.  As solemnly, he handed\r\nover to Catholic Germans the title to land for a hospital and religious\r\nestablishment on the road to Bethlehem.  Still solemnly, at a banquet\r\nin his honour in Damascus, he turned to the Turkish Vali, and declared:\r\n\"Say to the three hundred million {64} Moslems of the world that I am\r\ntheir friend.\"  To prove his sincerity he went out to put a wreath upon\r\nthe tomb of Saladin.\r\n\r\nWilhelm II at Damascus is reminiscent of Napoleon at Cairo.  Egypt and\r\nSyria and Mesopotamia have always cast a spell over men who have\r\ndreamed of world empires; and Islam, as a unifying force for conquest,\r\nhas appealed to the imagination of others before the present German\r\nKaiser.  I have used the word \"imagination\" intentionally.  There never\r\nhas been any solidarity in the religion of Mohammed; there is none now;\r\nthere never will be.  The idea of community of aims and community of\r\ninterests is totally lacking in the Mohammedan mind.  Solidarity is\r\nbuilt upon the foundation of sacrifice of self for others.  It is a\r\nvirtue not taught in the Koran, nor ever developed by any Mohammedan\r\ncivilizations.  The failure of all political organisms of Mohammedan\r\norigin to endure and to become strong has been due to the fact that\r\nMohammedans have never felt the necessity of giving themselves for the\r\ncommon weal.  The virility of a nation is in the virile service of\r\nthose who love it.  If there is no willingness to serve, no incentive\r\nto love, how can a nation live and be strong?\r\n\r\nThe revelation of Germany's ambition by the granting of the concession\r\nfrom Konia to the Persian Gulf, and the application of the German\r\nfinanciers for a _firman_ constituting the Bagdad Railway Company, led\r\nto international intrigues and negotiations for a share in the\r\nconstruction of the line through Mesopotamia.  It would be wearisome\r\nand profitless {65} to follow the various phases of the Bagdad\r\nquestion.  Germany did not oppose international participation in the\r\nconcession.  The expense of crossing the Taurus and the dubious\r\nfinancial returns from the desert sections influenced the Germans to\r\nwelcome the financial support of others in an undertaking that they\r\nwould have found great difficulty in financing entirely by their own\r\ncapital.  The _Bagdadbahn_ concession was granted in 1899: the _firman_\r\nconstituting the company followed in 1903.\r\n\r\nRussia did not realize the danger of German influence at\r\nConstantinople, and of the eventualities of the German \"pacific\r\npenetration\" in Asia Minor.  She adjusted the Macedonian question with\r\nEmperor Franz Josef in order to have a free hand in Manchuria, and she\r\nmade no opposition to the German ambitions.  She needed the friendly\r\nneutrality of Germany in her approaching struggle with Japan.  Once the\r\nstruggle was begun, Russia found herself actually dependent upon the\r\ngoodwill of Germany.  It was not the time for Petrograd to fish in the\r\ntroubled waters of the Golden Horn.\r\n\r\nThe situation was different with Great Britain.  The menace of the\r\nGerman approach to the Persian Gulf was brought to the British Foreign\r\nOffice just long enough before the Boer crisis became acute for a\r\ndecision to be made.  Germany had sent engineers along the proposed\r\nroute of her railway.  She had neglected to send diplomatic agents!\r\n\r\nThe proposed--in fact the only feasible--terminus on the Persian Gulf\r\nwas at Koweit.  Like the Sultan of Muscat, the Sheik of Koweit was\r\npractically {66} independent of Turkey.  While showing deference to the\r\nSultan as Khalif, Sheik Mobarek resisted every effort of the Vali of\r\nBassorah to exercise even the semblance of authority over his small\r\ndomain.  In 1899, Colonel Meade, the British resident of the Persian\r\nGulf, signed with Mobarek a secret convention which assured to him\r\n\"special protection,\" _if he would make no cession of territory without\r\nthe knowledge and consent of the British Government_.  The following\r\nyear, a German mission, headed by the Kaiser's Consul General at\r\nConstantinople, arrived in Koweit to arrange the concession for the\r\nterminus of the _Bagdadbahn_.  They were too late.  The door to the\r\nPersian Gulf was shut in the face of Germany.\r\n\r\nWilhelm II set into motion the Sultan.  The Sublime Porte suddenly\r\nremembered that Koweit was Ottoman territory, and began to display\r\ngreat interest in forcing the Sheik to recognize the fact.  A Turkish\r\nvessel appeared at Koweit in 1901.  But British warships and British\r\nbluejackets upheld the _independence_ of Koweit!  Since the\r\nConstitution of 1908, all the efforts of the Young Turks at Koweit have\r\nbeen fruitless.  Germany remains blocked.\r\n\r\nBritish opposition to the German schemes was not limited to the\r\nprevention of an outlet of the _Bagdadbahn_ at Koweit.  In 1798, the\r\nEast India Company established a resident at Bagdad to spy upon and\r\nendeavour to frustrate the influence of the French, just beginning to\r\npenetrate towards India through the ambition of Napoleon to inherit the\r\nempire of Alexander.  Since that time, British interests have not\r\nfailed to be well looked after in Lower Mesopotamia.  {67} After the\r\nLynch Brothers, in 1860, obtained the right of navigating on the\r\nEuphrates, the development of their steamship lines gradually gave\r\nGreat Britain the bulk of the commerce of the whole region, in the\r\nPersian as well as the Ottoman _hinterland_ of the Gulf.  In 1895,\r\nGerman commerce in the port of Bushir was non-existent, while British\r\ncommerce surpassed twelve million francs yearly.  In 1905, the market\r\nwas shared about equally between Great Britain and Germany.  In 1906,\r\nthe Hamburg-American Line established a service to Bassorah.  British\r\nmerchants began to raise the cry that if the _Bagdadbahn_ appeared the\r\nGermans would soon have not only the markets of Mesopotamia but also\r\nthat of Kermanshah.  The Lynch Company declared that the _Bagdadbahn_\r\nwould ruin their river service, and their representations were listened\r\nto at London, despite the absurdity of their contention.  The Lynches\r\nwere negotiating with Berlin also.  This mixture of politics and\r\ncommerce in Mesopotamia is a sordid story, which does not improve in\r\nthe telling.\r\n\r\nThe revolution of 1908 did not injure the German influence at\r\nConstantinople as much as has been popularly supposed.  The Germans\r\nsucceeded during the first troubled year in keeping in with both sides\r\nthrough the genius of Baron Marschall von Bieberstein, in spite of the\r\nBosnia-Herzegovina affair.  Germany was fortunately out of the Cretan\r\nand Macedonian muddles, in which her rivals were hopelessly entangled.\r\nMahmud Shevket pasha was always under German influence, and the Germans\r\nhad Enver bey, \"hero of liberty,\" in training at Berlin.  {68} German\r\ninfluence at Constantinople succeeded also in withstanding the strain\r\nof the Tripolitan War, although it grew increasingly embarrassing as\r\nthe months passed to be Turkey's best friend and at the same time the\r\nally of Italy!  During the first disastrous period of the war of the\r\nBalkan Allies against Turkey, it seemed for the time that the enemies\r\nof Germany controlled the Sublime Porte.  But the revolver of Enver bey\r\nin the _coup d'état_ of January, 1913, brought once more the control of\r\nTurkish affairs into hands friendly to Germany.  They have remained\r\nthere ever since.\r\n\r\nGermany strengthened her railway scheme, and her hold on the\r\nterritories through which it was to pass, by the accord with Russia at\r\nPotsdam in 1910.\r\n\r\nThe last clever attack of British diplomacy on the _Bagdadbahn_ was\r\nsuccessfully met.  In tracing the extension of the railway beyond\r\nAdana, it was suggested to the Department of Public Works that the cost\r\nof construction would be greatly reduced and the usefulness of the line\r\nincreased, if it passed by the Mediterranean littoral around the head\r\nof the Gulf of Alexandretta.  Then the control of the railway would\r\nhave been at the mercy of the British fleet.  When the \"revised\" plans\r\nwent from the Ministry of Public Works to the Ministry of War, it was\r\nnot hard for the German agents to persuade the General Staff to restore\r\nthe original route inland across the Amanus, following the old plan\r\nagreed upon in the time of Abdul Hamid.  More than that, the Germans\r\nsecured concessions for a branch line from Aleppo to the Mediterranean\r\nat Alexandretta, {69} and for the construction of a port at\r\nAlexandretta.  The _Bagdadbahn_ was to have a Mediterranean terminus at\r\na fortified port, and Germany was to have her naval base in the\r\nnorth-east corner of the Mediterranean, eight hours from Cyprus and\r\nthirty-six hours from the Suez Canal!  This was the revenge for Koweit.\r\n\r\nA month before the Servian ultimatum, Germany had contracted to grant a\r\nloan to Bulgaria, one of the conditions of which was that Germany be\r\nallowed to build a railway to the Ægean across the Rhodope Mountains to\r\nPorto Laghos, and to construct a port there, six hours from the mouth\r\nof the Dardanelles.  There was a panic in Petrograd.\r\n\r\nThe events in Turkey since the opening of the war are too recent\r\nhistory and as yet too little understood to dwell upon.  But the\r\nreception accorded to the _Goeben_ and _Breslau_ at the Dardanelles,\r\ntheir present[1] anomalous position in \"closed waters\" in defiance of\r\nall treaties, the abolition of the foreign post-offices, the unilateral\r\ndecision to abrogate the capitulations--all these straws show in which\r\ndirection the wind is blowing on the Bosphorus.  A successful\r\ntermination of the German campaign in France, which at this writing\r\nseems most improbable (in spite of the fact that the Germans are at\r\nCompiègne and their aëroplanes pay us daily visits), would certainly\r\ndraw Turkey into the war--and to her ruin.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] October, 1914.\r\n\r\n[2] This chapter was written before the sudden and astonishing acts of\r\nwar by Turkey in sinking a Russian ship and bombarding Russian Black\r\nSea ports on October 29, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n{70}\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the German reliance upon embarrassing the French and\r\nBritish in their Moslem colonies through posing as the defenders of\r\nIslam and Islam's Khalif has not been well-founded.  On the battlefield\r\nof France, thousands of followers of Mohammed from Africa and Asia are\r\nfighting loyally under the flags of the Allies.  The Kaiser, for all\r\nhis dreams and hopes, has not succeeded in getting a single Mohammedan\r\nto draw his sword for the combined causes of Pan-Germanism and\r\nPan-Islamism.  Have the three hundred million Moslems forgotten the\r\ndeclaration of Damascus?\r\n\r\nIn seeking for the causes of the present conflict, it is impossible to\r\nneglect Germany in the Ottoman Empire.  As one looks up at Pera from\r\nthe Bosphorus, the most imposing building on the hill is the German\r\nEmbassy.  It dominates Constantinople.  There has been woven the web\r\nthat has resulted in putting Germany in the place of Great Britain to\r\nprevent the Russian advance to the Dardanelles, in putting Germany in\r\nthe place of Russia to threaten the British occupation of India and the\r\ntrade route to India, and in putting Germany in the place of Great\r\nBritain as the stubborn opponent of the completion of the African\r\nEmpire of France.  The most conspicuous thread of the web is the\r\n_Bagdadbahn_.  In the intrigues of Constantinople, we see develop the\r\npolitical evolution of the past generation, and the series of events\r\nthat made inevitable the European war of 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{71}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nALGECIRAS AND AGADIR\r\n\r\nIn 1904, an accord was made between Great Britain and France in regard\r\nto colonial policy in northern Africa.  Great Britain recognized the\r\n\"special\" interests of France in Morocco in exchange for French\r\nrecognition of Great Britain's \"special\" interests in Egypt.  There was\r\na promise to defend each other in the protection of these interests,\r\nbut no actual agreement to carry this defence beyond the exercise of\r\ndiplomatic pressure.  The accord was a secret one.  Its exact terms\r\nwere not known until the incident of Agadir made necessary its\r\npublication in November, 1911.\r\n\r\nBut that there was an accord was known to all the world.  Germany, who\r\nhad long been looking with alarm upon the extension of French influence\r\nin Morocco, found in 1905 a favourable moment for protest.  Russia had\r\nsuffered humiliation and defeat in her war with Japan.  Neither in a\r\nmilitary nor a financial way was she at that moment a factor to be\r\nreckoned with in support of France.  Great Britain had not recovered\r\nfrom the disasters to her military organization of the South African\r\ncampaign.  Her domestic politics were in a chaotic state.  The {72}\r\nConservative Ministry was losing ground daily in bye elections; the\r\nIrish question was coming to the front again.\r\n\r\nGerman intervention in Morocco was sudden and theatrical.  On March 31,\r\n1905, a date of far-reaching importance in history, Emperor William\r\nentered the harbour of Tangier upon his yacht, the _Hohenzollern_.\r\nWhen he disembarked, he gave the cue to German policy by saluting the\r\nrepresentative of the Sultan, with peculiar emphasis, as the\r\nrepresentative of an independent sovereign.  Then, turning to the\r\nGerman residents in Morocco who had gathered to meet him, he said: \"I\r\nam happy to greet in you the devoted pioneers of German industry and\r\ncommerce, who are aiding in the task of keeping always in a high\r\nposition, in a _free land_, the interests of the mother country.\"\r\n\r\nThe repercussion of this visit to Tangier in France and in Great\r\nBritain was electrical.  It seemed to be, and was, a direct challenge\r\non the part of Germany for a share in shaping the destinies of Morocco.\r\nIt was an answer to the Anglo-French accord, in which Germany had been\r\nignored.  Great Britain was in no position to go beyond mere words in\r\nthe standing behind France.  France knew this.  So did Germany.  After\r\nseveral months of fruitless negotiations between Berlin and Paris, on\r\nJune 6th, it was made plain to France that there must be a conference\r\non the Moroccan question.\r\n\r\nM. Delcassé, at that time directing with consummate skill and courage\r\nthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs, urged upon the Cabinet the necessity\r\nfor accepting {73} Germany's challenge.  But the Cabinet, after hearing\r\nthe sorrowful confessions of the Ministers of War and Navy, and\r\nlearning that France was not ready to fight, refused to accept the\r\nadvice of the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  M. Delcassé resigned.  A\r\nblow had been struck at French prestige.\r\n\r\nFor six months the crisis continued in an acute stage.  The\r\nchauvinistic--or shall we say, patriotic?--elements were determined to\r\nwithstand what they called the Kaiser's interference in the _domestic_\r\naffairs of France.  But France seemed isolated at that moment, and\r\nprudence was the part of wisdom.  M. Rouvier declared to the Chamber of\r\nDeputies on December 16th: \"France cannot be without a Moroccan policy,\r\nfor the form and direction which the evolution of Morocco will take in\r\nthe future will influence in a decisive manner the destinies of our\r\nNorth African possessions.\"  France agreed to a conference, but won\r\nfrom Germany the concession that France's special interests and rights\r\nin Morocco would be admitted as the basis of the work of the conference.\r\n\r\nOn January 17, 1906, a conference of European States, to which the\r\nUnited States of America was admitted, met to decide the international\r\nstatus of Morocco.  For some time the attitude of the German delegates\r\nwas uncompromising.  They maintained the Kaiser's thesis as set forth\r\nat Algiers: the _complete_ independence of Morocco, and sovereignty of\r\nher Sultan.  But they finally yielded, and acknowledged the right of\r\nFrance and Spain to organize in Morocco an international police.\r\n\r\nThe Convention was signed on April 7th.  It {74} provided for: (1)\r\npolice under the sovereign authority of the Sultan, recruited from\r\nMoorish Moslems, and distributed in the eight open ports; (2) Spanish\r\nand French officers, placed at his disposal by their governments, to\r\nassist the Sultan; (3) limitation of the total effective of this police\r\nforce from two thousand to two thousand five hundred, of French and\r\nSpanish officers, commissioned sixteen to twenty, and non-commissioned\r\nthirty to forty, appointed for five years; (4) an Inspector General, a\r\nhigh officer of the Swiss army, chosen subject to the approval of the\r\nSultan, with residence at Tangier; (5) a State Bank of Morocco, in\r\nwhich each of the signatory Powers had the right to subscribe capital;\r\n(6) the right of foreigners to acquire property, and to build upon it,\r\nin any part of Morocco; (7) France's exclusive right to enforce\r\nregulations in the frontier region of Algeria and a similar right to\r\nSpain in the frontier region of Spain; (8) the preservation of the\r\npublic services of the Empire from alienation for private interests.\r\n\r\nChancellor von Bülow's speech in the _Reichstag_ on April 5, 1906, was\r\na justification of Germany's attitude.  It showed that the policy of\r\nWilhelmstrasse had been far from bellicose, and that Germany's demands\r\nwere altogether reasonable.  The time had come, declared the\r\nChancellor, when German interests in the remaining independent portions\r\nof Africa and Asia must be considered by Europe.  In going to Tangier\r\nand in forcing the conference of Algeciras, Germany had laid down the\r\nprinciple that there must be equal opportunities for {75} Germans in\r\nindependent countries, and had demonstrated that she was prepared to\r\nenforce this principle.\r\n\r\nWhen one considers the remarkable growth in population, and the\r\nindustrial and maritime evolution of Germany, this attitude cannot be\r\nwondered at, much less condemned.  Germany, deprived by her late\r\nentrance among nations of fruitful colonies, was finding it necessary\r\nto adopt and uphold the policy of trying to prevent the pre-emption,\r\nfor the benefit of her rivals, of those portions of the world which\r\nwere still free.\r\n\r\nNeither France nor Spain had any feeling of loyalty toward the\r\nConvention of Algeciras.  However much may have been written to prove\r\nthis loyalty, the facts of the few years following Algeciras are\r\nconvincing.  After 1908, Spain provoked and led on by the tremendous\r\nexpenditures entailed upon her by the Riff campaigns began to consider\r\nthe region of Morocco in which she was installed as exclusively Spanish\r\nterritory.  French writers have expended much energy and ingenuity in\r\nproving the disinterestedness of French efforts to enforce loyally the\r\ndecisions of Algeciras.  But they have explained, they have protested,\r\ntoo much.  There has never been a moment that France has not dreamt of\r\nthe completion of the vast colonial empire in North Africa by the\r\ninclusion of Morocco.  It has been the goal for which all her military\r\nand civil administrations in Algeria and the Sahara have been working.\r\nTo bring about the downfall of the Sultan's authority, not only press\r\ncampaigns were undertaken, but anarchy on the Algerian frontier {76}\r\nwas allowed to go on unchecked, until military measures seemed\r\njustifiable.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way, the German colonists of Morocco did their best to\r\nbring about another intervention by Germany.  Their methods were so\r\ndespicable and outrageous that they had frequently to be disavowed\r\nofficially.  In 1910, the German Foreign Office found the claims of\r\nMannesmann Brothers to certain mining privileges invalid, because they\r\ndid not fulfil the requirements of the Act of Algeciras.  But the\r\nMannesmann mining group, as well as other German enterprises in\r\nMorocco, were secretly encouraged to make all the trouble they could\r\nfor the French, while defending the authority of the Sultan.  The\r\nCasablanca incident is only one of numerous affronts which the French\r\nwere asked to swallow.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain had her part, though not through official agents, in the\r\nintrigues.  There is much food for thought in the motives that may, not\r\nwithout reason, be imputed to the publication in the _Times_ of a\r\nseries of stories of Moroccan anarchy, and of Muley Hafid's cruelties.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1911, it was realized everywhere in Europe that the\r\nSultan's authority was even less than it had been in 1905.  The Berber\r\ntribes were in arms on all sides.  In March, accounts began to appear\r\nof danger at Fez, not only to European residents, but also to the\r\nSultan.  The reports of the French Consul, and the telegrams of\r\ncorrespondents of two Paris newspapers, were most alarming.  On April\r\n2d, it was announced that the Berber tribes {77} had actually attacked\r\nthe city and were besieging it.  Everything was prepared for the final\r\nact of the drama.\r\n\r\nA relief column of native troops under Major Bremond arrived in Fez on\r\nApril 26th.  The very next day, an urgent message for relief having\r\nbeen received from Colonel Mangin in Fez, Colonel Brulard started for\r\nthe capital with another column.  Without waiting for further word, a\r\nFrench army which had been carefully prepared for the purpose, entered\r\nMorocco under General Moinier.  On May 21st, Fez was occupied by the\r\nFrench.  They found that all was well there with the Europeans and with\r\nthe natives.  But, fortunately for the French plans, Muley Hafid's\r\nbrother had set himself up at Mequinez as pretender to the throne.  The\r\nSultan could now retain his sovereignty only by putting himself under\r\nthe protection of the French army.  Morocco had lost her independence!\r\n\r\nGermany made no objection to the French expeditionary corps in April.\r\nShe certainly did not expect the quick succession of events in May\r\nwhich brought her face to face with the _fait accompli_ of a strong\r\nFrench army in Fez.  As soon as it was realized at Berlin that the\r\nfiction of Moroccan independence had been so skilfully terminated,\r\nFrance was asked \"what compensation she would give to Germany in return\r\nfor a free hand in Morocco.\"  The _pourparlers_ dragged on through\r\nseveral weeks in June.  France refused to acknowledge any ground for\r\ncompensation to Germany.  She maintained that the recent action in\r\nMorocco had been at the request {78} of the Sultan, and that it was a\r\nmatter entirely between him and France.\r\n\r\nGermany saw that a bold stroke was necessary.  On July 1st, the gunboat\r\n_Panther_ went to Agadir, a port on the Atlantic coast of Morocco.  To\r\nGreat Britain and to France, the dispatch of the _Panther_ was\r\nrepresented as due to the necessity of protecting German interests,\r\nseeing that there was anarchy in that part of Morocco.  But the German\r\nnewspapers, even those which were supposed to have official relations\r\nwith Wilhelmstrasse, spoke as if a demand for the cession of Mogador or\r\nsome other portion of Morocco was contemplated.  The Chancellor\r\nexplained to the Reichstag that the sending of the _Panther_ was \"to\r\nshow the world that Germany was firmly resolved not to be pushed to one\r\nside.\"\r\n\r\nBut in the negotiations through the German Ambassador in Paris, it was\r\nclear that Germany was playing a game of political blackmail.  The\r\nGerman Foreign Office shifted its claims from Morocco to concessions in\r\nCentral Africa.  On July 15th, Germany asked for the whole of the\r\nFrench Congo from the sea to the River Sanga, and a renunciation in her\r\nfavour of France's contingent claims to the succession of the Belgian\r\nCongo.  The reason given to this demand was, that if Morocco were to\r\npass under a French protectorate, it was only just that compensation\r\nshould be given to Germany elsewhere.  France, for the moment,\r\nhesitated.  She definitely refused to entertain the idea of\r\ncompensation as soon as she had received the assurance of the {79} aid\r\nof Great Britain in supporting her against the German claims.\r\n\r\nOn July 1st, the German Ambassador had notified Sir Edward Grey of the\r\ndispatch of the _Panther_ to Agadir \"in response to the demand for\r\nprotection from German firms there,\" and explained that Germany\r\nconsidered the question of Morocco reopened by the French occupation of\r\nFez, and thought that it would be possible to make an agreement with\r\nSpain and France for the partition of Morocco.  On July 4th, Sir Edward\r\nGrey, after a consultation with the Cabinet, answered that Great\r\nBritain could recognize no change in Morocco without consulting France,\r\nto whom she was bound by treaty.  The Ambassador then explained that\r\nhis Government would not consider the reopening of the question in a\r\nEuropean conference, that it was a matter directly between Germany and\r\nFrance, and that his overture to Sir Edward Grey had been merely in the\r\nnature of a friendly explanation.\r\n\r\nGermany believed that the constitutional crisis in Great Britain was so\r\nserious that the hands of the Liberal Cabinet would be tied, and that\r\nthey would not be so foolhardy as to back up France at the moment when\r\nthey themselves were being so bitterly assailed by the most influential\r\nelements of the British electorate on the question of limiting the veto\r\npower of the House of Lords.  It was in this belief that Germany on\r\nJuly 15th asked for territorial cessions from France in Central Africa.\r\nWilhelmstrasse thought the moment well chosen, and that there was every\r\nhope of success.\r\n\r\n{80}\r\n\r\nBut the German mentality has never seemed to appreciate the frequent\r\nlesson of history, that the British people are able to distinguish\r\nclearly between matters of internal and external policy.  Bitterly\r\nassailed as a traitor to his country because he advocates certain\r\nchanges of laws, a British Cabinet Minister can still be conscious of\r\nthe fact that his bitterest opponents will rally around him when he\r\ntakes a stand on a matter of foreign policy.  This knowledge of\r\nadmirable national solidarity enabled Mr. Lloyd George on July 21st,\r\nthe very day on which the King gave his consent to the creation of new\r\npeers to bring the House of Lords to reason, at a Mansion House\r\nbanquet, to warn Germany against the danger of pressing her demands\r\nupon France.  The effect, both in London and Paris, was to unify and\r\nstrengthen resistance.  It seemed as if the _Panther's_ visit to Agadir\r\nhad put Germany in the unenviable position of having made a threat\r\nwhich she could not enforce.\r\n\r\nBut the ways of diplomacy are tortuous.  Throughout August and\r\nSeptember, Germany blustered and threatened.  In September, several\r\nevents happened which seemed to embarrass Russia and tie her hands, as\r\nin the first Moroccan imbroglio of 1905.  For Premier Stolypin was\r\nassassinated at Kiev on September 14th; the United States denounced its\r\ncommercial treaty with Russia on account of the question of Jewish\r\npassports; and the Shuster affair in Persia occupied the serious\r\nattention of Russian diplomacy.  Had it not been for the splendidly\r\nloyal and scrupulous attitude of the {81} British Foreign Office\r\ntowards Russia in the Persian question, Germany might have been tempted\r\nto force the issue with France.\r\n\r\nGerman demands grew more moderate, but were not abandoned.  For members\r\nof the House of Commons, of the extreme Radical wing in the Liberal\r\nparty, began to put the British Government in an uncomfortable\r\nposition.  Militarism, entangling alliances with a continental Power,\r\nthe necessity for agreement with Germany,--these were the subjects\r\nwhich found their way from the floor of the House of Commons to the\r\npublic press.  A portion of the Liberal party which had to be reckoned\r\nwith believed that Germany ought not to have been left out of the\r\nAnglo-French agreement.  So serious was the dissatisfaction, that the\r\nGovernment deemed it necessary to make an explanation to the House.\r\nSir Edward Grey explained and defended the action of the Cabinet in\r\nsupporting the resistance of France to Germany's claims.  The whole\r\nhistory of the negotiation was revealed.  The Anglo-French agreement of\r\n1904 was published for the first time, and it was seen that this\r\nagreement did not commit Great Britain to backing France by force of\r\narms.\r\n\r\nUncertainty of British support had the influence of bringing France to\r\nconsent to treat with Germany on the Moroccan question.  Two agreements\r\nwere signed.  By the first, Germany recognized the French protectorate\r\nin Morocco, subject to the adhesion of the signers of the Convention of\r\nAlgeciras, and waived her right to take part in the negotiations\r\nconcerning Moroccan spheres of influence {82} between Spain and France.\r\nOn her side, France agreed to maintain the open door in Morocco, and to\r\nrefrain from any measures which would hinder the legitimate extension\r\nof German commercial and mining interests.  By the second agreement,\r\nFrance ceded to Germany, in return for German cessions, certain\r\nterritories in southern and eastern Kamerun.\r\n\r\nThere was a stormy Parliamentary and newspaper discussion, both in\r\nFrance and Germany, over these two treaties.  No one was satisfied.\r\nThe treaties were finally ratified, but under protest.\r\n\r\nIn France, the Ministry was subject to severe criticism.  There was\r\nalso some feeling of bitterness--perhaps a reaction from the\r\nsatisfaction over Mr. Lloyd George's Mansion House speech--in the\r\nuncertainty of Great Britain's support, as revealed by the November\r\ndiscussions in the House of Commons.  This uncertainty remained, as far\r\nas French public opinion went, until Great Britain actually declared\r\nwar upon Germany in August, 1914.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, the _Reichstag_ debates revealed the belief that the Agadir\r\nexpedition had, on final analysis, resulted in a _fiasco_.  An\r\nastonishing amount of enmity against Great Britain was displayed.  It\r\nwas when Herr Heydebrand made a bitter speech against Great Britain,\r\nand denounced the pacific attitude of the German Government, in the\r\nReichstag session of November 10th, that the Crown Prince made public\r\nhis position in German foreign policy by applauding loudly.\r\n\r\nThe aftermath of Agadir, as far as it affected Morocco, resulted in the\r\nestablishment of the French {83} Protectorate, on March 30, 1912.  The\r\nSultan signed away his independence by the Treaty of Fez.  Foreign\r\nlegations at Fez ceased to exist, although diplomatic officials were\r\nretained at Tangier.  France voted the maintenance of forty thousand\r\ntroops in Morocco \"for the purposes of pacification.\"  The last\r\ncomplications disappeared when, on November 27th, a Franco-Spanish\r\nTreaty was signed at Madrid, in which the Spanish zones in Morocco were\r\ndefined, and both states promised not to erect fortifications or\r\nstrategic works on the Moroccan coast.\r\n\r\nBut the aftermath of Agadir in France and Germany has been an increase\r\nin naval and military armaments, and the creation of a spirit of\r\ntension which needed only the three years of war in the Ottoman Empire\r\nto bring about the inevitable clash between Teuton and Gaul.  Taken in\r\nconnection with the recent events in Alsace and Lorraine, and the\r\nvoting of the law increasing military service in France to three years,\r\nthe logical sequence of events is clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{84}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE PASSING OF PERSIA\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the Ottoman Empire and of Morocco served to bring the\r\ncolonial and commercial aspiration of Germany into conflict with other\r\nnations of Europe.  The recent fortunes of Persia, the third--and only\r\nother--independent Mohammedan state, have also helped to make possible\r\nthe general European war.\r\n\r\nThe first decade of the twentieth century brought about in Persia, as\r\nin Turkey, the rise of a constitutional party, which was able to force\r\na despotic sovereign to grant a constitution.  The Young Persians had\r\nin many respects a history similar to that of the Young Turks.  They\r\nwere for the most part members of influential families, who had been\r\neducated in Europe, or had been sent into exile.  They had imbibed\r\ndeeply the spirit of the French Revolution from their reading, and had\r\nat the same time developed a narrow and intense nationalism.  But to\r\nsupport their revolutionary propaganda, they had allied themselves\r\nduring the period of darkness with the Armenians and other non-Moslems.\r\nAs Salonika, a city by no means Turkish, was the _foyer_ of the young\r\nTurk movement, so Tabriz, {85} capital of the Azerbaidjan, a city by no\r\nmeans Persian, was the centre of the opposition to Persian despotism.\r\n\r\nYoung Turks, Young Persians, Young Egyptians, Young Indians, and Young\r\nChinese have shown to Europe and America the peril--and the pity--of\r\nour western and Christian education, when it is given to eastern and\r\nnon-Christian students.  They are born into the intellectual life with\r\nour ideas and are inspired by our ideals, but have none of the\r\nbackground, none of the inheritance of our national atmosphere and our\r\nfamily training to enable them to live up to the standards we have put\r\nbefore them.  Their disillusionment is bitter.  They resent our\r\nattitude of superiority.  They hate us, even though they feign to\r\nadmire us.  Their jealousy of our institutions leads them to console\r\nthemselves by singling out and forcing themselves to see only the weak\r\nand vulnerable points in our civilization.  Educated in our\r\nuniversities, they return to their countries to conspire against us.\r\nThe illiterate and simple Oriental, who has never travelled, is\r\nfrequently the model of fidelity and loyalty and affection to his\r\nOccidental master or friend.  But no educated non-Christian Oriental,\r\nwho has travelled and studied and lived on terms of equality with\r\nEuropeans or Americans in Europe or America, can ever be a sincere\r\nfriend.  The common result of social contact and intellectual\r\ncompanionship is that he becomes a foe,--and conceals the fact.\r\nFamiliarity has bred more than contempt.\r\n\r\nThe Young Persians would have no European {86} aid.  They waited, and\r\nsuffered.  Finally, after a particularly bad year from the standpoint\r\nof financial exactions, the Moslem clergy of the North were drawn into\r\nthe Young Persia movement.  A revolution, in which the Mohammedan\r\n_mullahs_ took part, compelled the dying Shah, Muzaffereddin, to issue\r\na decree ordering the convocation of a _medjliss_ (committee of\r\nnotables) on August 5, 1906.  This improvised Parliament, composed only\r\nof delegates of the provinces nearest the capital, drafted a\r\nconstitution which was promulgated on New Year's Day, 1907.  The\r\nfollowing week, Muzaffereddin died and was succeeded by his son,\r\nMohammed Ali Mirza, a reactionary of the worst type.\r\n\r\nMohammed Ali had no intention of putting the Constitution into force.\r\nA serious revolution broke out in Tabriz a few weeks after his\r\naccession.  He was compelled to acknowledge the Constitution granted by\r\nhis father.  In order to nullify its effect, however, the new Shah\r\ncalled to the Grand Vizierate the exiled Ali Asgar Khan, whom he\r\nbelieved to be strong enough to overrule the wishes of the Parliament.\r\nThe Constitutionalists formed a society of _fedavis_ to prevent the\r\nreturn to absolutism.  At their instigation, Ali Asgar Khan was\r\nassassinated.  The country fell into an anarchic state.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Persia, as much because of the inexperience of the\r\nConstitutionalists as of the ill-will of the Shah, was worse off than\r\nunder the despotism of Muzaffereddin.  There was no money in the\r\ntreasury.  The peasants would not pay their taxes.  One can hardly\r\nblame them, for not a cent of the {87} money ever went for local\r\nimprovements or local government.  Throughout Persia, even in the\r\ncities, life was unsafe.  The Persians, no more than the Turks, could\r\ncall forth from the ranks of their enthusiasts a progressive and\r\nfearless statesman of the type of Stambuloff or Venizelos.  In their\r\nParliament they all talked at once.  None was willing to listen to his\r\nneighbour.  It may have been because there was no Mirabeau.  But could\r\na Mirabeau have overcome the fatal defects of the Mohammedan training\r\nand character that made the Young Persians incapable of realizing the\r\nconstitutionalism of their dreams?  Every man was suspicious and\r\njealous of his neighbour.  Every man wanted to lead, and none to be\r\nled.  Every man wanted power without responsibility, prestige without\r\nwork, success without sacrifice.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that one of the most significant events of\r\ncontemporary times was helped to fruition by the state of affairs in\r\nPersia.  Great Britain and Russia, rivals--even enemies--in western and\r\ncentral Asia, signed a convention.  Their conflicting ambitions were\r\namicably compromised.  Along with the questions of Afghanistan and\r\nThibet, this accord settled the rivalry that had done much to keep\r\nPersia a hotbed of diplomatic intrigue like Macedonia ever since the\r\nCrimean War.\r\n\r\nIn regard to Persia, the two Powers solemnly swore to respect its\r\nintegrity and its independence, and then went on to sign its death\r\nwarrant, by agreeing upon the question of \"the spheres of influence.\"\r\nIn spite of all sophisms, this convention marked the {88} passing of\r\nPersia as an independent state.  Persia is worse off than Morocco and\r\nEgypt.  For one master is better than two!\r\n\r\nHere enters Germany.  For many years German merchants had looked upon\r\nPersia as they looked upon Morocco and Turkey.  Here were the\r\nlegitimate fields for commercial expansion.  Probably there were also\r\ndreams of political advantages to be gained later.  In their dealings\r\nwith the three Moslem countries that were still \"unprotected\" when they\r\ninaugurated their _Weltpolitik_, the Germans had been attentive\r\nstudents of British policy in the days of her first entry into India\r\nand to Egypt.  There were many Germans who honestly believed that their\r\nactivities in these independent Moslem countries would only give them\r\n\"their place under the sun,\" and a legitimate field for the overflow of\r\ntheir population and national energy, but that it would also be a\r\ndistinct advantage to the peace of the world.  Great Britain and Russia\r\nand France had already divided up between them the larger part of Asia\r\nand Africa.  In the process, Great Britain had _recently_ come almost\r\nto blows with both her rivals.  If Germany stepped in between them,\r\nwould this not prevent a future conflict?  But the rivals \"divided up.\"\r\nGermany was left out in the cold.  It is not a very far cry from\r\nTeheran and Koweit and Fez to Liège and Brussels and Antwerp.  Belgium\r\nis paying the bill.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Russian convention of August 31, 1907, was the first of three\r\ndoors slammed in Germany's face.  The Anglo-French convention of April\r\n{89} 8, 1904, had been an attempt to do this.  But by Emperor William's\r\nvisit to Tangiers in 1905, Germany got in her foot before the door was\r\nclosed!  In Persia there was no way that she could intervene directly\r\nto demand that Great Britain and Russia bring their accord before an\r\ninternational congress.\r\n\r\nGermany began to work in Persia through two agencies.  She incited\r\nTurkey to cross the frontier of the Azerbaidjan, and to make the\r\nperfectly reasonable request that the third limitrophe state should be\r\ntaken into the _pourparlers_ which were deciding the future of Persia.\r\nThen she sent her agents among the Nationalists, and showed them how\r\nterrible a blow this convention was to their new constitutionalism.\r\nJust at the moment when they had entered upon a constitutional life,\r\nGreat Britain and Russia had conspired against their independence, went\r\nthe German thesis.\r\n\r\nIf only there had been a sincerity for the Constitution in the heart of\r\nthe Shah, and an ability to establish a really constitutional _régime_\r\nin the leaders of Young Persia, the Anglo-Russian accord might have\r\nproved of no value.  But--unfortunately for Persia and for Germany--the\r\nShah, worked upon skilfully by Russian emissaries and by members of his\r\n_entourage_, who were paid by Russian gold, attempted a _coup d'état_\r\nagainst the Parliament in December, 1907.  He failed to carry it\r\nthrough.  With a smile on his lips and rage in his heart, he once more\r\nwent through the farce of swearing to be a good constitutional ruler.\r\nBut in June, 1908, he succeeded {90} in dispersing the Parliament by\r\nbombarding the palace in which it sat.\r\n\r\nIt would be wearisome to go into the story of the revolts and anarchy\r\nin all parts of Persia in 1908 and 1909.  After a year of fighting and\r\nOriental promises, of solemn oaths and the breaking of them, the\r\nconstitutionalists finally drove Mohammed Ali from Teheran in July,\r\n1909.  The Shah saved his life by taking refuge in the Russian\r\nlegation.  A few days later, he took the road to exile.  He has since\r\nreappeared in Persia twice to stir up trouble in the north.  On both\r\noccasions, it was when the Russians were finding it hard to justify\r\ntheir continued occupation of the northern provinces.\r\n\r\nMohammed Ali was succeeded by his son Ali Mirza, a boy of eleven years,\r\nwho was still too young to be anything more than a mere plaything in\r\nthe hands of successive regents.\r\n\r\nThe civil strife in Persia gave Great Britain and Russia the excuse for\r\nentering the country.  In accord with Great Britain, Russia sent an\r\nexpedition to occupy Tabriz on April 29, 1909.  Later, Russian troops\r\noccupied Ardebil, Recht, Kazvin, and other cities in the Russian sphere\r\nof influence.  Owing to the anarchy in the south during 1910, Great\r\nBritain prepared to send troops \"to protect the safety of the roads for\r\nmerchants.\"  This was not actually done, for conditions of travel\r\nslightly ameliorated.  But Persia has rested since under the menace of\r\na British occupation.\r\n\r\nEvery effort made to bring order out of chaos in Persia has failed.\r\nSerious attempts at financial {91} reform were undertaken by an\r\nAmerican mission, under the direction of a former American official in\r\nthe Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nThe new American Treasurer-General would not admit that the\r\nAnglo-Russian accord of 1907 was operative in Persia.  One day in the\r\nsummer of 1911, I was walking along the Galata Quay in Constantinople.\r\nI heard my name called from the deck of a vessel just about to leave\r\nfor Batum.  Perched on top of two boxes containing typewriters, was a\r\nyoung American from Boston, who was going out to help reform the\r\nfinances of Persia.  I had talked to him the day before concerning the\r\nextreme delicacy and difficulty of the task of the mission whose\r\nsecretary he was.  But his refusal to admit the political limitations\r\nof Oriental peoples made it impossible for him to see that\r\nconstitutional Persia was any different, or should be treated any\r\ndifferently, from constitutional Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nFrom the sequel of the story, it would seem that Mr. Shuster had the\r\nsame attitude of mind as his secretary.  He refused to appoint fiscal\r\nagents in the Russian \"sphere\" on any other ground than personal\r\nfitness and ability.  Russia protested.  Mr. Shuster persisted.  A\r\nmarch on Teheran to expel the Americans was threatened.  Persia yielded\r\nand gave up the American mission--and her independence.\r\n\r\nWhen Germany saw that the Russian troops had entered northern Persia\r\nwith the consent of Great Britain, and had come to stay, there was\r\nnothing for her to do but to treat with Russia.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1910, when the Czar was visiting {92} the Kaiser, Russian\r\nand German ministers exchanged views concerning the ground upon which\r\nGermany would agree to the _fait accompli_ of Russia's exclusive\r\npolitical interests in Northern Persia, and the Russian military\r\noccupation.  Satisfactory bases were found for an agreement between\r\nRussia and Germany concerning their respective interests in Persia and\r\nAsiatic Turkey.  The Accord of Potsdam, as it is called, was made in\r\nthe form of a note presented by the Russian Government to Germany, and\r\naccepted by her.  Russia declared that she would in no way oppose the\r\nrealization of the project of the Bagdad railway up to the Persian\r\nGulf, and that she would construct to the border of Persia a railway to\r\njoin a spur of the Bagdad railway from Sadije to Khanikin.  In return\r\nfor this, Germany was to promise not to construct railway lines outside\r\nof the Bagdad railway zone, to declare that she had no political\r\ninterest in Persia, and to recognize that \"Russia has special interests\r\nin Northern Persia from the political, strategic, and economic points\r\nof view.\"  The German Government was to abandon any intention of\r\nsecuring a concession for a trans-Persian railway.  On the other hand,\r\nRussia promised to maintain in Northern Persia the \"open door,\" so that\r\nGerman commercial interests should not be injured.\r\n\r\nThe accord between Russia and Germany was badly received everywhere.\r\nFrance feared that Germany was trying to weaken the Franco-Russian\r\nalliance.  Great Britain did not look with favour upon a recognition by\r\nRussia of German interests in Asiatic Turkey.  The Sublime Porte felt\r\nthat {93} Russia and Germany had shown a disregard for the elementary\r\nprinciples of courtesy in discussing and deciding questions that were\r\nof tremendous importance to the future of Turkey without inviting the\r\nSublime Porte to take part in the negotiations.  Turkey in the Potsdam\r\naccord was ignored as completely as Morocco had been in the Algeciras\r\nConvention and Persia in the Russo-British accord.\r\n\r\nThe Potsdam stipulations brought prominently before Europe the possible\r\nsignificance of Germany's free hand in Anatolian and Mesopotamian\r\nrailway constructions.  It also aroused interest in the possibility of\r\nan all-rail route from Calais to Calcutta, in which all the Great\r\nPowers except Italy would participate.\r\n\r\nThe trans-Persian and all other railway schemes in Persia came to\r\nnothing.  Between 1872 and 1890 twelve district railway projects had\r\nreceived concessions from the Persian Government.  One of these, the\r\nReuter group, actually started the construction of a line from the\r\nCaspian Sea to the Persian Gulf.  A French project for a railway from\r\nTrebizond to Tabriz had gained powerful financial support.  All these\r\nschemes were frustrated by Russian diplomacy.  In 1890, Russia secured\r\nfrom the Persian Government the exclusive right for twenty-one years to\r\nconstruct railways in Northern Persia.  Needless to say, no lines were\r\nbuilt.  Russia had all she could do with her trans-Siberian and\r\ntrans-Caucasian schemes.  But she deliberately acted the dog in the\r\nmanger.  By preventing private groups from building railways in Persia\r\nwhich she would not {94} build herself, Russia has retarded the\r\neconomic progress, and is largely responsible for the financial,\r\nmilitary, and administrative weakness, of contemporary Persia.  By the\r\naccords of 1907 with Great Britain and 1911 with Germany, Russia\r\nsecured their connivance in still longer continuing this shameful\r\nstagnation.  To this day no railroad has been built in the Shah's\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\nJust a month before the outbreak of the European war, the boy Shah of\r\nPersia was solemnly crowned at Teheran.  It was an imposing and\r\npathetic ceremony.  The Russians and British saw to it that full honour\r\nshould be given to the sovereign of Persia.  The pathos of the event\r\nwas in the fact that the Russian and British legations at Teheran paid\r\nthe expenses of the coronation.  The Shah received his crown from the\r\nhands of his despoilers.  A similar farce was enacted a little while\r\nbefore in Morocco.  Turkey alone of Moslem nations remains.\r\n\r\nThe last effort of Persia to shake off the Russian octopus was made on\r\nOctober 8, 1914, when Russia was requested once more to withdraw her\r\ntroops from the Azerbaijan.  The Russian Minister at Teheran, without\r\ngoing through the form of referring the request to Petrograd, answered\r\nthat the interests of Russia and other foreign countries could be\r\nsafeguarded only by the continued occupation.  To this response his\r\nBritish colleague gave hearty assent.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the passing of Persia is two-fold.  It shows how in\r\none more direction Germany found herself shut out from a possible field\r\nof expansion.  Through the weakness of Persia, Great Britain {95} and\r\nRussia, after fifty years of bitter struggle, were able to come to a\r\nsatisfactory compromise.  It was in Persia that their animosity was\r\nburied, and that co-operation of British democracy and Russian\r\nautocracy in a war against Germany was first envisaged.  The failure of\r\nthe Persian constitutional Government was a tremendous blow to Germany.\r\nIt strengthened the bases of the Triple Entente.  For the events of\r\n1908 and 1909 put the accord to severe test, and proved that it was\r\nbuilt upon a solid foundation.  The agony of one people is often the\r\njoy of another.  Has Persia suffered vicariously that France may be\r\nsaved?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{96}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE PARTITIONERS AND THEIR POLES[*]\r\n\r\n\r\n[*] This chapter has not been written without giving consideration to\r\nthe Russian point of view.  There is an excellent book on Russia since\r\nthe Japanese War (from 1906 to 1912) by Peter Polejaïeff.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Russia, Austria, and Prussia partitioned Poland at the end of the\r\neighteenth century, there were at the most six million Poles in the\r\nvast territory stretching from the Baltic nearly to the Black Sea.  Of\r\nthese a large number, especially in Eastern Prussia and in Silesia, had\r\nalready lost their sense of nationality.  Poland was a country of\r\nfeudal nobles, whose inability to group under a dynasty for the\r\nformation of a modern state, made the disappearance of the kingdom an\r\ninexorable necessity in the economic evolution of Europe, and of\r\nignorant peasants, who were indifferent concerning the political status\r\nof the land in which they lived.\r\n\r\nTo-day there are twenty million Poles.  Although they owe allegiance to\r\nthree different sovereigns, they are more united than ever in their\r\nhistory.  For their national feeling has developed in just the same way\r\nthat the national feeling of Germans and Russians has developed, by\r\neducation primarily, and by that remarkable tendency of industrialism,\r\n{97} which has grouped people in cities, and brought them into closer\r\nassociation.  This influence of city life upon the destinies of Poland\r\ncomes to us with peculiar force when we realize that since the last map\r\nof Europe was made Warsaw has grown from forty thousand to eight\r\nhundred thousand, Lodz from one thousand to four hundred thousand,\r\nPosen from a few hundreds to one hundred and fifty thousand, Lemberg\r\nand Cracow from less than ten thousand to two hundred thousand and one\r\nhundred and fifty thousand respectively.  These great cities (except\r\nLodz, which Russia foolishly allowed to become an outpost of\r\nPan-Germanism in the heart of a Slavic population) are the _foyers_ of\r\nPolish nationalism.\r\n\r\nThe second and third dismemberments of Poland (1793 and 1795) were soon\r\nannulled by the Napoleonic upheaval.  The larger portion of Poland was\r\nrevived in the Grand Duchy of Warsaw.  The Congress of Vienna, just one\r\nhundred years ago, made what the representatives of the partitioning\r\nPowers hoped would be a definite redistribution of the unwelcome ghost\r\nstirred up by Napoleon.  Poznania was returned to Prussia, and in the\r\nwestern end of Galicia a Republic of Cracow was created.  The greater\r\nportion of Poland reverted to Russia, _not as conquered territory, but\r\nas a separate state, of which the Czar assumed the kingship and swore\r\nto preserve the liberties_.  The unhappiness, the unrest, the\r\nagitation, among the Poles of the Muscovite Empire, just as among the\r\nFinns, came from the breaking of the promises by Russia to Europe when\r\nthese subjects of alien races were allotted to her.\r\n\r\n{98}\r\n\r\nThe story of modern Poland is not different from that of any other\r\nnationalistic movement.  A sense of nationality and a desire for racial\r\npolitical unity are not the phenomena which have been the underlying\r\ncauses of the evolution of Europe since the Congress of Vienna.  In\r\nItaly, in Germany, in Poland, in Alsace-Lorraine, in Finland, among the\r\nvarious races of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Balkan Peninsula,\r\nas well as in Turkey and Persia, the underlying cause of political\r\nagitation, of rebellions and of revolutions has been the desire to\r\nsecure freedom from absolutism.  Nationalism is simply the tangible\r\noutward manifestation of the growth of democracy.  There are few\r\nnational movements where separatism could not have been avoided by\r\ngranting local self-government.  Mixed populations can live together\r\nunder the same government without friction, if the lesser races are\r\ngranted social, economic, and political equality.  But nations that\r\nhave achieved their own unity and independence through devotion to a\r\nnationalistic movement have shown no mercy or wisdom with smaller and\r\nless fortunate races under their domination.  The very methods that\r\nEuropean statesmen have fondly believed were necessary for assimilation\r\nhave proved fatal to it.\r\n\r\nThe Polish question, as we understand it to-day, has little connection\r\nwith the Polish revolutions of 1830 and of 1863.  These movements\r\nagainst the Russian Government were conducted by the same elements of\r\nprotest against autocracy that were at work in the larger cities and\r\nuniversities throughout Europe during the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.  {99} Nationalism was the reason given rather than the cause\r\nthat prompted.  The revolutions were unsuccessful because they were not\r\nsupported by the nation.  The mass of the people were indifferent to\r\nthe cause, just as in other countries similar revolutions against\r\ndespotism failed for lack of real support.  The apathy of the masses\r\nhas always been the bulwark of defence for autocracy and reactionary\r\npolicies.  Popular rights do not come to people until the masses demand\r\nthem.  Education alone brings self-government.  This is the history of\r\nthe evolution of modern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Poles _as a nation_ began to worry their partitioners in the decade\r\nfollowing the last unsuccessful revolution against Russia.  To\r\nunderstand the contemporary phases of the Polish question, it is\r\nnecessary for us to follow first its three-fold development, as a\r\nquestion of internal policy in Russia, Germany, and Austria.  Only then\r\nis its significance as an international question clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLES SINCE 1864 IN RUSSIA\r\n\r\nThe troubles of Russia in her relationship to the Poles have come\r\nlargely from the fact that the distinction between Poland proper,\r\ninhabited by Poles, and the provinces which the Jagellons conquered but\r\nnever assimilated, was not grasped by the statesmen who had to deal\r\nwith the aftermath of the revolution.  What was possible in one was\r\nthought to be possible in the other.  What was vital in one was\r\nbelieved to be vital in the other.  In the kingdom {100} of Poland, as\r\nit was bestowed upon the Russian Czar by the Congress of Vienna, there\r\nwere massed ten million Poles who could be neither exterminated nor\r\nexiled.  Nor was there a sound motive for attempting to destroy their\r\nnational life.  The kingdom of Poland was not an essential portion of\r\nthe Russian Empire, and was not vitally bound to the fortunes of the\r\nEmpire.  So unessential has the kingdom of Poland been to Russia, and\r\nso fraught with the possibilities of weakness to its owner, that\r\npatriotic and far-sighted Russian publicists have advocated its\r\ncomplete autonomy, its independence or its cession to Germany.  Because\r\nit was limitrophe to the territories occupied by the Poles of the other\r\npartitioners, there was constantly danger of weakening the defences of\r\nthe empire and of international complications.  Through failing to\r\ntreat these Poles in such a way that they would be a loyal bulwark\r\nagainst her enemies, Russia has done irreparable harm to herself as\r\nwell as to them.\r\n\r\nThe Polish question in Lithuania, Podolia, and the Ukraine was a\r\ntotally different matter.  These provinces had been added to Russia in\r\nher logical development towards the west and the south-west.  Their\r\npossession was absolutely essential to the existence of the Empire.\r\nTheir population was not Polish, but Lithuanian, Ruthenian, and\r\nRussian.  From the Baltic to the Black Sea, the acquisition of these\r\nterritories made possible the entrance of Russia into the concert of\r\nEuropean nations.  They had been conquered by Poland during the period\r\nof her greatness, and had naturally been lost by her {101} when she\r\nbecame weak.  In these portions of Greater Poland, the Poles were\r\nlimited to the landowning class, and to the more prosperous artisans in\r\nthe cities and villages.  They were the residue of an earlier\r\nconquering race that had never assimilated the country.  They had\r\nabused their power, and were heartily disliked.  These provinces were\r\nvital to Russia, and she was able to carry out the policy of uprooting\r\nthe Poles.  Their villages were burned, their fortunes and their lands\r\nconfiscated, the landed proprietors deported to Siberia, and others so\r\ncruelly persecuted that, when their churches and schools were closed\r\nand they found themselves forbidden to speak their language outside of\r\ntheir own homes, they emigrated.  In Lithuania, the Lithuanian language\r\nwas also proscribed.  The Russians had no intention of blotting out a\r\nPolish question in order to make place for a Lithuanian one.\r\n\r\nWhere the Poles were few in number, these measures, which were exactly\r\nthe same as the Poles had employed themselves in the same territories\r\nseveral centuries before, were successful.  The peasants were glad to\r\nsee their traditional persecutors get a taste of their own medicine.\r\nIt was not difficult to make these provinces Russian.  They have\r\ngradually been assimilated into the Empire.  In all fairness, one can\r\nhardly condemn the Russian point of view, as regards the Poles in\r\nLithuania, Podolia, and the Ukraine.  Only youthful Polish irredentists\r\nstill dream of the restoration of the Empire of the Jagellons.\r\n\r\nIn the kingdom of Poland, the situation was {102} entirely different.\r\nThis huge territory had been given to Russia by the Congress of Vienna\r\nupon the solemn assurance that it was to be governed as a separate\r\nkingdom by the Romanoffs.  There was no thought in the Congress of\r\nVienna of the disappearance of the Poles as a separate nationality from\r\nthe map of Europe.  But the autonomy of Poland was suppressed after the\r\nrebellion of 1830.\r\n\r\nAfter the rebellion of 1863, Russia tried to assimilate the kingdom of\r\nPoland as well as the Polish marches.  The repression was so severe\r\nthat Polish nationalism was considered dead.  The peasants had been\r\nindifferent to the movement.  Not only had they failed to support it,\r\nbut they had frequently shown themselves actually hostile to it.\r\n\r\nIt was because the nobles and priests were believed to be leaders of\r\nnationalistic and separatist movements, not only in Poland but in other\r\nallogeneous portions of the composite Empire, that Czar Alexander II\r\nemancipated the serfs.  The policy of every autocratic government, when\r\nit meets the first symptoms of unrest in a subject race, is to strike\r\nat their church and their aristocracy.  The most efficient way to\r\nweaken the power of the nobles is to strengthen the peasants.\r\nAlexander himself may have been actuated by motives of pure humanity,\r\nbut his ministers would never have allowed the _ukase_ to be\r\npromulgated, had they not seen in it the means of conquering the\r\napproaching revolution in Poland.  For the moment it was an excellent\r\nmove, and accomplished its purpose.  The Polish {103} peasants were led\r\nto believe that the Czar was their father and friend and champion\r\nagainst the exactions of the church and landowner.  Was not their\r\nemancipation proof of this?\r\n\r\nBut in the long run the emancipation of the serfs proved fatal to\r\nRussian domination in Poland.  For the advisers of Alexander had not\r\nrealized that freemen would demand and attend schools, and that\r\nschools, no matter how careful the surveillance and restrictions might\r\nbe, created democrats.  Democrats would seize upon nationalism to\r\nexpress their aspiration for self-government.  The emancipation of the\r\nserfs, launched as a measure to destroy Poland, has ended in making it.\r\nEmancipation created Polish patriots.  It was a natural and inevitable\r\nresult.  The artificial aid of a governmental persecution helped and\r\nhastened this result.  The Irishman expressed a great truth when he\r\nsaid that there are things that are not what they are.\r\n\r\nA flock of hungry Russian functionaries descended upon Poland in 1864.\r\nThey took possession of all departments of administration.  The Polish\r\nlanguage was used in courts only through an interpreter, and was\r\nforbidden as the medium of instruction in schools.  No Polish signs\r\nwere tolerated in the railways or post-offices.  In the parts of the\r\nkingdom where there were bodies of the Lithuanians, their nationalism\r\nwas encouraged, and they were shown many favours, in contradiction to\r\nthe policy adopted towards the Lithuanians of Lithuania.  Catholics who\r\nfollowed the Western Rite were forced to join the national church.\r\nThere was a clear intention {104} to assimilate as much as possible the\r\npopulations of the border districts of Poland.\r\n\r\nAfter thirty years of repression, Russia had made no progress in\r\nPoland.  In 1897, Prince Imeretinsky wrote to the Czar that the policy\r\nof the Government had failed.  Polish national spirit, instead of\r\ndisappearing, had spread remarkably among the peasant classes.  The\r\nsecret publication and importation of unauthorized journals and\r\npamphlets had multiplied.  The number of cases brought before the\r\ncourts for infraction of the \"law of association,\" which forbade\r\nunlicensed public gatherings and clubs, had so increased that they\r\ncould not be heard.  Heavy fines and imprisonment seem to have had no\r\ndeterring effect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map--Partitions of Poland]\r\n\r\nCould Russia hope to struggle against the tendencies of modern life?\r\nFree press and free speech are the complement of education.  When men\r\nlearn to read, they learn to think, and can be reached by propaganda.\r\nWhen men increase in prosperity, they begin to want a voice in the\r\nexpenditure of the money they have to pay for taxes.  When men come\r\ntogether in the industrial life of large cities, they form\r\nassociations.  No government, no system of spies or terrorism, no laws\r\ncan prevent propaganda in cities.  From 1864 to 1914, the kingdom of\r\nPoland has become more Polish than ever before in her history.  Instead\r\nof a few students and dreamers, fascinated by the past glories of their\r\nrace, instead of a group of landowners and priests, thinking of their\r\nprivate interests and of the Church, there is awakened a spirit of\r\nprotest against Russian {105} despotism in the soul of a race become\r\nintelligently nationalistic.\r\n\r\nThe issue between Russia and her Poles has become clearer, and for that\r\nreason decidedly worse, since the disastrous war with Japan.  The Poles\r\nhave demanded autonomy in the fullest sense of the word.  The Russians\r\nhave responded by showing that it is their intention to destroy Poland,\r\njust as they intend to destroy Finland.  There is an analogy between\r\nthe so-called constitutional _régimes_ in Russia and Turkey.  In each\r\nEmpire, the granting of a constitution was hailed with joy by the\r\nvarious races.  These races, who had been centres of agitation,\r\ndisloyalty, and weakness, were ready to co-operate with their\r\ngovernments in building up a large, broad, comprehensive, national life\r\nupon the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity.  But in both\r\nEmpires, the dominant race let it soon be understood that the\r\nConstitution was to be used for a destructive policy of assimilation.\r\nIn the Ottoman Empire, the Constitution was a weapon for destroying the\r\nnational aspirations of subject races.  In Russia it has been the same.\r\n\r\nAfter the Russo-Japanese War, Czar Nicholas and his ministers had their\r\ngreat opportunity to profit by the lessons of Manchuria.  But the\r\ngranting of a constitution was a pure farce.  Blind to the fact that\r\nthe enlightened Poles were interested primarily in political reforms,\r\nand in securing equity and justice for the kingdom of Poland, instead\r\nof for the advancement of a narrow and theoretical nationalistic ideal,\r\nthe Russians repulsed the proffered {106} loyalty of the Poles to a\r\nfree and constitutional Russian Empire.  In the second Duma, Dmowski\r\nand other Polish deputies unanimously voted the supplies for\r\nstrengthening the Russian army.  They stated that the Poles were\r\nwilling to cast their lot loyally and indissolubly with constitutional\r\nRussia.  Were they not brethren, and imbued with the same Pan-Slavic\r\nidea?  Was it not logical to look to Russia as the defender of all the\r\nSlavs from Teutonic oppression?\r\n\r\nBut Poland, like Finland, was to continue to be the victim of Russian\r\nbureaucracy and of an intolerant nationalism which the Russians were\r\nbeginning to feel as keenly and as arrogantly as the Prussians.  Is the\r\nKaiser, embodying the evils of militarism, more obnoxious and more\r\ndangerous to civilization than the Czar, standing for the horrors of\r\nbureaucratic despotism and absolutism?  Have not the Armenian\r\nmassacres, ordered from Constantinople, and the Jewish pogroms, ordered\r\nfrom Petrograd, associated Christian Czar with Mohammedan Sultan at the\r\nbeginning of the twentieth century?\r\n\r\nThe first deliberate violation of the integrity of the kingdom of\r\nPoland was sanctioned by the Russian Duma in the same session in which\r\nit approved violation of Russian obligations to Finland.  A law\r\nseparating Kholm from the kingdom of Poland was voted on July 6, 1912.\r\nThe test of the law declared that Kholm was still to be regarded as a\r\nportion of the kingdom of Poland, but to be directly attached to the\r\nMinistry of the Interior without passing by the intermediary of the\r\nGovernor-General of Warsaw; {107} and to preserve the Polish adaptation\r\nof the Code Napoléon for its legal administration, but to have its\r\ncourt of appeal at Kief.\r\n\r\nThe elections of 1913 from the kingdom of Poland to the Duma gave a\r\ndecided setback to the party of Dmowski, who had so long and so ably\r\npled for a policy of Pan-Slavism through accommodation with Russia.\r\nThe law concerning Kholm had been the response of the Duma to Dmowski's\r\nolive branch.  The moderates were discredited.  But the failure of the\r\nradical nationalists to conciliate the Jewish element caused their\r\ncandidates to lose both at Warsaw and Lodz.\r\n\r\nThe birth of an anti-Semitic movement has been disastrous to Polish\r\nsolidarity during recent years.  The Polish nationalists suspected the\r\nJews of working either for German or Russian interests.  They were\r\nexpecially bitter against the _Litvak_, or Lithuanian and south Russian\r\nJews, who had been forced by Russia to establish themselves in the\r\ncities of Poland.  Poland is one of the most important pales in the\r\nEmpire.  The Jewish population is one-fifth of the total, and enjoys\r\nboth wealth and education in the cities.  Their educated youth had been\r\ncourageous and forceful supporters of Polish nationalism.  Before the\r\nRussian intrigues of the last decade and the introduction of these\r\nnon-Polish Jews, there had never been a strong anti-Semitic feeling in\r\nPoland.  The Polish protests against the encroachment of the Russians\r\nupon their national liberties have been greatly weakened by their\r\nantagonism to the Jews.  The anti-Semitic movement, which has carried\r\naway {108} both the moderate party of Dmowski and the radical\r\nnationalists, as was expected, has played into the hand of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Muscovite statesmen, while endeavouring to use the Balkan Wars for\r\nthe amalgamation of south Slavic races under the wing of Russia against\r\nAustria have treated the Poles as if they were not Slavs.  During 1913\r\nand the first part of 1914, the policy of attempting to russianize the\r\nPoles has proved disastrous to their feeling of loyalty to the Empire.\r\nThe government announced definitely that the kingdom of Poland would be\r\n\"compensated\" for the loss of Kholm by a law granting self-government\r\nto Polish cities.  This promise has not been kept.  The municipal\r\nself-government project presented to the Duma was as farcical in\r\npractical results as all democratic and liberal legislation which that\r\nimpotent body has been asked to pass upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLES SINCE 1867 IN AUSTRIA-HUNGARY\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of Austria from Germany after the battle of Sadowa\r\nled to the organization of a new state, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\r\nWe must divorce in our mind the Austria before 1867 from the\r\nAustria-Hungary of the Dual Monarchy.  The political situation changed\r\nentirely when Austrians and Hungarians agreed to live together and\r\nshare the Slavic territories of the Hapsburg Crown.  Austria no longer\r\nhad need of her Galicians to keep the Hungarians in check.  But there\r\nwas equally important work for them to do.\r\n\r\n{109}\r\n\r\nThe Austrians have always treated the Poles very well.  Galicia, which\r\nhad been Austria's share in the partition of Poland, was given local\r\nself-government, with its own Diet, and proper representation in the\r\nAustrian _Reichsrath_.  Poles were admitted in generous numbers to the\r\nfunctions of the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe Polish nationalists of Russia and Prussia feel very bitter about\r\nthe indifference of the Galicians to the nation at large--or rather in\r\ncaptivity.  They claim that the lack of national feeling among the\r\nAustrian Poles is due to the fact that they have been bribed by the\r\nAustrians to desert not only their brethren of Russia and of Prussia,\r\nbut also their fellow-Slavs of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  I have\r\nheard this criticism ably and feelingly presented, but I do not think\r\nit just.  Since national aspirations are awakened and sustained by the\r\neffort to secure political equality and justice, the enjoyment of these\r\ntakes away need or desire to plot against the Government.  The Poles of\r\nAustria are like the French of Canada.  Their nationalism is literary\r\nand religious in character.  There is no reason for its being\r\nanti-governmental.\r\n\r\nOf late years, however, there has been a national Polish agitation in\r\nGalicia.  It is directed not against the Government, but against the\r\nRuthenians, who, to the number of three millions--nearly forty per\r\ncent. of the total population--inhabit the eastern section of Galicia.\r\nThis local racial conflict, which has strengthened rather than weakened\r\nthe attachment of the Poles to the Vienna Government, arose after the\r\nintroduction of universal suffrage, when {110} eastern Galicia began to\r\nsend in large numbers Ruthenian deputies to the Galician Diet and to\r\nthe Austrian Parliament.\r\n\r\nOn April 12, 1908, Count Potocki was assassinated by a Ruthenian\r\nstudent, whose death sentence was commuted to twenty years'\r\nimprisonment.  With the complicity of wardens, the assassin escaped\r\nfrom jail after three years.  There has never been peace between the\r\nPoles and the Ruthenians since that time.  After serious disorders at\r\nthe University of Lemberg, where the Ruthenian students were treated\r\ndisgracefully, Polish and Ruthenian leaders tried to find common ground\r\nfor reconciliation in December, 1911.  The Ruthenians demanded\r\nelectoral reform with greater representation, and the creation of a\r\nRuthenian university.  The imperial government communicated to the\r\nrepresentatives of the two nationalities the project of a decree of\r\npublic instruction in Galicia in January, 1913.  The project was a\r\nmarvel of ingenuity.  A Ruthenian university was to be established\r\nafter four years, but if by October 1, 1916, the law voting credits for\r\nit was not yet passed, a special school for Ruthenians would be\r\nattached to the University of Lemberg, until their own university was a\r\nreality.  The teaching of the Ruthenian language would cease in the\r\nUniversity of Lemberg when this \"special school\" was inaugurated.  The\r\nRuthenians were suspicious of a trick in the project.  They could not\r\nunderstand its vagueness.  It looked as if they would be giving up\r\ntheir present rights in the University of Lemberg, limited as they\r\nwere, for an uncertainty.  Why was {111} no definite date for opening\r\nspecified, or indication given of the new university's location?  Would\r\nit be maintained by Galicia with a budget appropriation in proportion\r\nto the taxes paid by Ruthenians?\r\n\r\nThe Ruthenian question in Galicia has been cited here to show how there\r\nare wheels within wheels in the complex questions of nationalities.\r\nEuropean racial questions seem to follow the law of the animal world.\r\nThe littlest animals are eaten by little animals, who in turn serve as\r\nfood for larger animals.  Nations which have suffered most cruelly from\r\nrace persecution are generally themselves relentless and fanatical when\r\nthe power to persecute is in their hands.\r\n\r\nThe Ruthenian question shows also how Poles and Austrians work\r\ntogether, and are content with the mutual advantages of their union.  I\r\nhave never met an Austrian Pole, who lived in Galicia and had a settled\r\nprofession or business there, who was not a loyal--even\r\nardent--supporter of the Hapsburg Monarchy.  Austrian Poles are\r\ndismayed as they face the terrible dilemma of union with Russia or\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLES SINCE 1870 IN GERMANY\r\n\r\nGermany, like Russia, has had a twofold Polish question: The\r\nacquisition of Polish territory on either side of the Vistula to the\r\nBaltic Sea was as essential to the creation of a strong Prussian\r\nkingdom as was the acquisition of Pomerania.  The portion of Poland\r\nwhich, before the partition, cut off eastern {112} from western Prussia\r\nwas fully as much German as Polish,--in fact more so.  It became German\r\nby logical and natural conquest in the course of Prussia's evolution.\r\n\r\nThe situation was different in Poznania.  This territory of the later\r\npartition reverted to Prussia at the Congress of Vienna.  In 1815, its\r\npopulation was only twenty per cent. German.  For fifty years the\r\nprocess of Germanization went on naturally--in no way forced.  When the\r\nGerman Empire was formed, nearly half of Poznania was German.  Many of\r\nthe leading Poles had lost their sense of Polish nationality.  They had\r\nbecome German in language and in culture.  How many families there are\r\nin Prussia whose Polish origin is betrayed only by their names!\r\n\r\nBut the Germanized Poles, for the most part, retained their religion.\r\nThe notorious _Kulturkampf_ of Bismarck aroused again the sense of\r\nnationality which had been lost, not only among the prosperous Poles of\r\nPoznania, but even of Silesia.  Only the bureaucratic classes were\r\nunaffected by this renaissance of nationalism awakened by revolt\r\nagainst religious persecution.\r\n\r\nJust after the formation of the Empire, when Prussia needed all her\r\nstrength and force to preserve her hegemony in the new confederation\r\nand to lead modern Germany in the path of progress and civilization, on\r\neither side of her kingdom she had to cope with nationalist movements\r\nof Danes and of Poles.  But she did not fear to undertake also the\r\nassimilation of Alsace and Lorraine!\r\n\r\n{113}\r\n\r\nSince the _Kulturkampf_, the Polish renaissance in Prussia has thrived\r\nin spite of persecution.  As in Russia, the Polish language was\r\nbanished, Polish teachers were transferred to schools in other parts of\r\nthe Empire, and about forty thousand Poles of Russian and Austrian\r\nnationality were expelled from the country.  The persecution has been\r\ncarried on in the schools, in the army, and in the church.  School\r\nchildren have been forbidden to pray in the Polish language.  Two\r\nunconstitutional laws have been passed by the Prussian Diet.  The first\r\nof these forbade the Poles to speak Polish in public gatherings.  The\r\nsecond, sanctioned by the _Landtag_ on March 8, 1908, authorized the\r\nGovernment to expropriate land owned by Poles _for the purpose of\r\nselling it to Germans_.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian scheme for getting rid of the Poles was to drive them from\r\ntheir lands and instal German colonists.  Private enterprise was first\r\ntried.  A \"colonization society\" was formed, with a large capital, and\r\ngiven every encouragement by Prussian officialdom.  But economic laws\r\nare not controlled by politics.  The colonists were boycotted.\r\nEnormous sums of money were lost in wasted crops.  The farms of the\r\ncolonists had to be resold by the sheriff, and were bought in by Poles.\r\nTo discourage the buying back of the German farms, a law was passed\r\nforbidding Poles to build upon land acquired by them after the date of\r\nthe colonization society's failure.  The Poles got around this law most\r\ncleverly.  If one goes into Poznania to-day, he will see farmhouses,\r\nbarns, dairies, stables--even chicken-coops--on {114} wheels.  The\r\npeople live in glorified wagons.  They do not build.  Will there be a\r\nlaw now against owning wagons?\r\n\r\nWhen the failure of private enterprise was demonstrated, the Prussian\r\nGovernment announced its intention of applying the law of expropriation\r\n\"for the use of the commission of colonization.\"  This was in October,\r\n1912.  At the beginning of 1913, the Polish deputies to the _Reichstag_\r\nbrought before their colleagues of all Germany the question of the\r\nexpropriation of Polish lands in Prussia.  They asked the\r\nrepresentatives of a supposedly advanced and constitutional nation what\r\nthey thought of this injustice.  Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg tried\r\nto keep the question from being debated.  He argued with perfect reason\r\nthat it was a purely internal Prussian matter, which the Imperial\r\nParliament was incompetent to discuss.  But the Catholic centre and the\r\nSocialist left combined to vote an order of the day allowing the\r\ndiscussion of the Polish lands question.\r\n\r\nIn the history of the German confederation, it was the first time that\r\nan imperial chancellor had received a direct defiance.  This vote is\r\nmentioned here to show how Prussian dealings with the Poles, just as\r\nwith Alsace-Lorraine, have tended to weaken the purely Prussian\r\nsubstructure of the German confederation, and to arouse a dangerous\r\nprotest against Prussian hegemony.  Contempt for the elementary\r\nprinciples of justice has been the key-note of Chancellor von\r\nBethmann-Hollweg's career.  His mentality is typical of that of German\r\nbureaucracy--no, more than that, of German statesmanship.  It is {115}\r\npossible to have sympathy with German national aspirations, but not\r\nwith the methods by which those aspirations are being interpreted to\r\nthe world.  To show how little regard he had for parliamentary opinion\r\nin the German confederation, the Chancellor forced through the Prussian\r\n_Landtag_, on April 22, 1913, only three months after his rebuke from\r\nthe _Reichstag_, an infamous law, voting one hundred and twenty-five\r\nmillion marks for German colonization in Prussian Poland.  Shortly\r\nbefore the European war broke out, another unconstitutional law was\r\npassed, which makes possible the arbitrary division of large landed\r\nproperties owned by Poles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INTERNATIONAL ASPECT OF THE POLISH QUESTION\r\n\r\nDuring the war with Japan, the Czar and the Kaiser understood each\r\nother perfectly on the Polish question.  The neutrality of Germany was\r\nessential to Russia at that time.  The Russians owe much to Germany for\r\nher benevolent attitude of those trying days.  The Poles have since\r\npaid the bill.\r\n\r\nAs in Prussia, the Poles of Russia have seen their liberties menaced\r\nmore than ever before during the past decade, and have had to struggle\r\nhopelessly against a policy of ruthless extermination.  If on the one\r\nhand the Prussian persecution is more to be condemned because Germany\r\nasks the world to believe that she is an enlightened, constitutional\r\nnation, and \"the torch-bearer of civilization,\" while Russia is\r\nadmittedly reactionary and still half-barbarous, on the other hand\r\nthere is less excuse for {116} the Russian persecution of the Poles.\r\nFor in Russia it is not Teuton against Slav, but Slav against Slav.\r\n\r\nGermany and Russia have had the common interest of fellow-criminals in\r\ntheir relation to the Polish nation.  Russia has not hesitated to\r\nco-operate with Germany through diplomatic and police channels in\r\nriveting more securely the fetters of the Poles.  Her championship of\r\nthe south Slavs against Teutonic aggression has been supposedly on the\r\ngrounds of \"burning love for our brothers in slavery, in whose veins\r\nruns the same blood as ours.\"  The sham and hypocrisy of this attitude\r\nis revealed when we consider the fact that Russia has never protested\r\nto Germany against the treatment of the Poles of Poznania, nor shown\r\nany inclination to treat with equity her own Poles.  Here are \"brothers\r\nin slavery\" nearer home.  There is ground for suspicion that her\r\ninterest in the south Slavs has been purely because they are on the way\r\nto Constantinople and the Mediterranean.  One who reads the recent\r\nhistory of Russia stultifies himself if he allows himself to believe\r\nthat Russia has entered into the present war to defend Servia from\r\nAustrian aggression _through any love for or humanitarian interest in\r\nthe Servians_.  If Russia gets the opportunity, will her treatment of\r\nServian national aspirations be any different from that of\r\nAustria-Hungary?  When we try to answer this question, let us think of\r\nBulgaria after 1878 (the last \"war of liberation\") and of Poland _in\r\n1914_.\r\n\r\nOn August 16, 1914, when I read the proclamation of Czar Nicholas to\r\nthe partitioned Poles, promising {117} to restore administrative\r\nautonomy to the kingdom of Poland, and posing as the liberator of Poles\r\nnow under the yoke of Austria and of Prussia, it was hard to be\r\nenthusiastic.  For the Jews of Odessa and Kief, and the Finns of\r\nHelsingfors, rise up to add their cry of warning to the bitter comments\r\nof Polish friends.  Only two years ago I saw in those cities subjects\r\nof the Czar suffering cruelly from fanaticism and broken promises, and\r\ndeprived of that which is now being held out as bait to the Poles, and\r\nas a sop to Russia's Allies.\r\n\r\nAustria-Hungary has been able to use the Russian treatment of Poland as\r\na means of strengthening her own hold on the border regions of the\r\nEmpire.  It was at the instigation of Ballplatz that the Galician\r\ndeputies, on December 16, 1911, made a motion in the Reichsrath,\r\ninviting the Minister of Foreign Affairs \"to undertake steps among the\r\nPowers who signed the conventions at Vienna in 1815 to assure the\r\nmaintenance of the frontiers of the kingdom of Poland, of which Russia,\r\nin violation of her international obligations, was threatening the\r\nintegrity.  For the separation of Kholm from Poland is an attack upon\r\nPolish historic and national consciousness.\"  It was tit for tat with\r\nthe two Eastern Powers.  Russia burned with indignation for the\r\nfeelings of Servia when Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina.\r\nAustria-Hungary burned with indignation for the feelings of her own\r\nloyal Polish subjects, when Russia separated Kholm from Poland.  Both\r\nhad violated international treaties.  Russia had no genuine interest in\r\nthe Servians, and Austria {118} none in the Poles.  They merely seized\r\nupon weapons with which to attack each other.\r\n\r\nIt is a mystery how French and British public opinion, always so\r\ntraditionally favourable to downtrodden races, and especially to the\r\nPoles, can hail the Russian entry into Lemberg as a \"victory for\r\ncivilization.\"  To the Austrian Poles, the coming of the Cossacks is as\r\nthe coming of the Uhlans to the Belgians.  They look upon the Russian\r\ninvasion of Galicia as a calamity to their national life.  Fighting\r\nwith the Austrians are thirty thousand young Poles who call themselves\r\nSokols (falcons).  Their organization is something like the German\r\n_Turnverein_, but more purely military.  The Poles of Austria-Hungary\r\nare a unit against Russia.\r\n\r\nOne can make no such positive statement about the attitude of the Poles\r\nof the other two partitioners.  They have little hope of any\r\namelioration of their lot from a change of masters through the present\r\nwar.  As I write, the thunder of German cannon is heard at Warsaw, and\r\nthe unhappy kingdom of Poland is the centre of conflict between Russia\r\nand Germany.  The Poles are fighting on both sides, and Polish\r\nnon-combatants are suffering from the brutality of both \"liberating\"\r\narmies.  The situation is exactly expressed by a Polish proverb which\r\nis the fruit of centuries of bitter experience: _Gdzie dwóch panów sie,\r\nbije, ch[l-tilde]op w skur[e-cedille], dostaje_--\"When two masters\r\nfight, the peasant receives the blows.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{119}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nITALIA IRREDENTA\r\n\r\nIrredentism grew inevitably out of the decisions of the Congress of\r\nVienna, whose members were subjected to two influences in making a new\r\nmap of Europe.  The first consideration, so common and so necessary in\r\nall diplomatic arrangements, was that of expediency.  The second\r\nconsideration was to prevent the rise of liberalism and democracy.  The\r\ndecisions on the ground of the first consideration were made under the\r\npressure and the play and the skill of give and take by the\r\nrepresentatives of the nations who fondly believed that they were\r\nmaking a lasting peace for Europe.  The decisions on the ground of the\r\nsecond consideration were guided by the idea that the checking of\r\nnational aspirations was the best means of preventing the growth of\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nThe decisions of Vienna, like the later modifications of Paris and\r\nBerlin, could not prevent the development of the national movements\r\nwhich have changed the map as it was rearranged after the collapse of\r\nthe Napoleonic _régime_.\r\n\r\nDuring the past hundred years, ten new states have appeared on the map\r\nof Europe: Greece, {120} Belgium, Servia, Italy, the German\r\nConfederation, Rumania, Montenegro, Norway, Bulgaria,\r\nand--possibly--Albania.  With the exception of Albania (and is this the\r\nreason why we have to qualify its viability by the word _possibly?_),\r\n_all of these states have appeared upon the map against the will of,\r\nand in defiance of, the concert of the European Powers_.  They have\r\nall, again with the exception of Albania, been born through a rise of\r\nnational consciousness preceded and inspired by a literary and\r\neducational revival.  The goal has been democracy.  None of them, in\r\nachieving independence, has succeeded in including within its frontiers\r\nall the territory occupied by people of the same race and the same\r\nlanguage.  _Irredentism is the movement to secure the union with a\r\nnation of contiguous territories inhabited by the same race and\r\nspeaking the same language_.  It is the call of the redeemed to the\r\nunredeemed, and of the unredeemed to the redeemed.\r\n\r\nIf we were to regard the present unrest in Europe and the antagonism of\r\nnations from the standpoint of nationalism, we could attribute the\r\nbreaking out of contemporary wars to five causes: the desire of nations\r\nto get back what they have lost, illustrated by France in relationship\r\nto Alsace-Lorraine; the desire of nations to expand according to their\r\nlegitimate racial aspirations, illustrated by the Balkan States in\r\nrelationship to Turkey and Austria-Hungary, and Italy in relationship\r\nto Austria-Hungary; the desire of nations to expand commercially and\r\npolitically because of possession of surplus population and energy,\r\nillustrated by Germany in her {121} _Weltpolitik_; the desire of\r\nnations to prevent the commercial and political expansion of their\r\nrivals, illustrated by Great Britain and Russia; and the desire of\r\nnations to stamp out the rise of national movements which threaten\r\ntheir territorial integrity, illustrated by Austria-Hungary and Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe irredentism of the Balkan States led, first, to their war with\r\nTurkey; second, to their war with each other; and third, to Servia\r\nbecoming the direct cause of the European war.  The aspirations of none\r\nhave been satisfied.  Rumanian irredentism has stood between Rumania\r\nand the Triple Alliance.  The irredentism of Italy has not yet led to\r\nanything, but it is so full of significance as a possible factor in\r\nbearing upon and changing the whole destinies of Europe during the\r\nwinter of 1914-1915, that it cannot be overlooked in a study of\r\ncontemporary national movements and wars.\r\n\r\nThe entrance of Italy into an alliance with the Teutonic Powers of\r\nCentral Europe was believed by her statesmen to be an act of\r\nself-preservation.\r\n\r\nThe opposition of the French clerical party to the completion of the\r\nunification of Italy during the last decade of the Third Empire\r\ndestroyed whatever gratitude the Italian people may have felt for the\r\ndecisive aid rendered to the cause of Italian unity at Solferino.  On\r\nthe part of the moving spirits of Young Italy, indeed, this gratitude\r\nwas not very great.  For the first great step in the unification of\r\nItaly had been accompanied by a dismemberment of the territories from\r\nwhich the royal house of Piedmont took its name.  Young Italy felt that\r\nthe French {122} had been paid for their help against Austria, and paid\r\ndearly.  The cession of his birthplace, at the moment when the nation\r\nfor which he had suffered so terribly and struggled so successfully\r\ncame into being, hurt Garibaldi more than the French bullets lodged in\r\nhis body eight years later at Mentana.  When the French look to-day\r\nwith joy upon Italian irredentism as the hopeless barrier between Italy\r\nand Austria-Hungary, they should not forget that, even though fifty\r\nyears have passed, Italian irredentism includes also Savoy and Nice.\r\n\r\nAfter the Franco-German War, there were two tendencies in the policy of\r\nthe Third Republic to prevent an understanding between France and\r\nItaly.  The first of these was the recurrence in France of the old\r\nbitter clericalism of the Empire.  Italy feared that French soldiers\r\nmight again come to Rome.  The second was the antagonism of France to\r\nthe budding colonial aspirations of Italy.  When France occupied Tunis,\r\nItaly felt that she had been robbed of the realization of a dream,\r\nwhich was hers by right of history, geography, and necessity.\r\n\r\nSo Italy joined the Triple Alliance.  It is argued with reason in\r\nFrance that the alliance of Teuton and Latin was unnatural.  Since\r\nItaly had become wholly Guelph to realize its unity, why this sudden\r\nreturn to Ghibellinism?  The alliance of Italy with Germany and\r\nAustria-Hungary, however, was not more paradoxical than the alliance of\r\nincreasingly democratic and socialistic and anti-clerical France with\r\nmediæval Russia.  The reasons dictating the alliance were practically\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n{123}\r\n\r\nBut there was this difference.  Italy entered into an alliance with a\r\nformer enemy and oppressor, who was still holding certain unredeemed\r\nterritories of the united Italy as it had existed in the minds of the\r\nenthusiasts of the middle of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nToo many books have been written about the distribution of populations\r\nin the Austro-Hungarian Empire to make necessary going into the details\r\nhere of the Italian populations of the Austrian Tyrol and of the\r\nAustrian provinces at the north of the Adriatic Sea.  The Tyrolese\r\nItalians are undoubtedly Italian in sympathies and characteristics.\r\nBut is their union with Italy demanded by either internal Italian or\r\nexternal European political and economic considerations more than would\r\nbe the union with Italy of the Italian cantons of the Swiss\r\nconfederation?\r\n\r\nItalian irredentism in regard to the Adriatic littoral is a far more\r\nserious and complicated problem.  One is struck everywhere in the\r\nAdriatic, even as far south as Corfu, by the Italian character of the\r\ncities.  Cattaro, Ragusa, Spalato, Zara, Fiume, Pola, and Trieste, all\r\nhave an indefinable Italian atmosphere.  It has never left them since\r\nthe Middle Ages.  It is in the buildings, however, rather than in the\r\npeople.  One hesitates to attribute even to the people of Fiume and\r\nTrieste Italian characteristics in the narrower sense of the word.  On\r\nthe Dalmatian coast, the Slavic element has won all the cities.  In\r\nFiume and Trieste, it is strong enough to rob these two cities of their\r\ndistinctive Italian character.  One's misgivings concerning the claims\r\nof Italian irredentists grow when he leaves the cities.  {124} There\r\nare undoubtedly several hundred thousands of Italians in this region.\r\nItalian is the language of commerce, and on the Austrian-Lloyd and\r\nHungaro-Croatian steamship lines, Italian is the language of the crews.\r\nBut the people who speak Italian are not Italians, in every other case\r\nyou meet, nor do they resemble Italians.  Why is this?\r\n\r\nNationality, in the twentieth century, has a mental and civic, rather\r\nthan a physical and hereditary basis.  _We are the product of our\r\neducation and of the political atmosphere in which we live_.  This is\r\nwhy assimilation is so strikingly easy in America, where we place the\r\nimmigrant in touch with the public school, the newspaper, and the\r\nballot.  Just as the Italians and Germans and French of Switzerland are\r\nSwiss, despite their differences of language, so the Italians of the\r\nAdriatic littoral are the product of the dispensation under which they\r\nhave lived.  Unlike the Alsatians, they have never known political\r\nfreedom and cultural advantages in common with their kin across a\r\nfrontier forcibly raised to cut them off; unlike the Poles, they have\r\nnot been compelled to revive the nationalism of an historic past as a\r\nmeans of getting rid of oppression; unlike the Slavs of the Balkans,\r\ntheir national spirit has not been called into being by the tyranny of\r\na race alien in civilization and ideals, because alien in religion.\r\n\r\nI have among my clippings from French newspapers during the past five\r\nyears a legion of quotations from Vienna and Rome correspondents,\r\nconcerning the friction between Austria-Hungary and Italy, and between\r\nthe Italian-speaking population {125} of Austria and the Viennese\r\nGovernment, over the question of distinct Italian nationality of\r\nAustro-Hungarian subjects.  There have been frontier incidents; there\r\nhave been demonstrations of Austrian societies visiting Italian cities\r\nand Italian societies visiting Trieste; there has been much discussion\r\nover the creation of an Italian Faculty of Law at the University of\r\nVienna, and the establishment of an Italian University at Trieste or\r\nVienna; and there have been occasional causes of friction between the\r\nAustrian Governor of Istria and the Italian residents of the province.\r\nBut the general impression gained from a study of the incidents in\r\nquestion, and the effort to trace out their aftermath, leads to the\r\nconclusion that these irredentist incidents have been magnified in\r\nimportance.  A clever campaign of the French press has endeavoured to\r\ndetach Italian public opinion from the Triple Alliance by publishing in\r\ndetail, on every possible occasion, any incident that might show\r\nAustrian hostility to the Italian \"nation.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1844, Cesare Balbo, in his _Speranze d'Italia_, a book that is as\r\nimportant to students of contemporary politics as to those of the\r\nRisorgimento, set forth clearly that the hope of Italy to the exclusion\r\nof Austria from Lombardy and Venetia was most reasonably based _upon\r\nthe extension of the Austrian Empire eastward through the approaching\r\nfall of the Ottoman Empire_.  Balbo was a man of great vision.  He\r\nlooked beyond the accidental factors in the making of a nation to the\r\ngreat and durable considerations of national existence.  He grasped the\r\nfact {126} that the insistence of the Teutonic race upon holding in\r\nsubjection purely Italian territories, and its hostility to the\r\nunification of the Italian people, was based upon economic\r\nconsiderations.  Lombardy and Venetia had been for a thousand years the\r\npathway of German commerce to the Mediterranean.  If Austria, Balbo\r\nargued, should fall heir to a portion of the European territories of\r\nthe Ottoman Empire, she would have her outlet to the Mediterranean more\r\nadvantageously than through the possession of Lombardy and Venetia.\r\nOnce these Ottoman territories were secured, Austria would be ready to\r\ncede Lombardy and Venetia to a future united Italy.\r\n\r\nAfter the unity of Italy had been achieved, and Austria had been driven\r\nout of Lombardy and Venetia, she did receive compensation in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, and, just as Balbo predicted, there was born the Austrian\r\nambition to the succession of Macedonia.  _That this ambition has not\r\nbeen realized, and that Russia was determined to prevent the attempt to\r\nrevive it, explains the Austro-Hungarian willingness to fight Russia in\r\nthe summer of 1914_.\r\n\r\nAustria and Hungary, from the very beginning of existence as a Dual\r\nMonarchy, have been caught in the vise between Italian irredentism and\r\nServian irredentism.  They have not been able to secure their outlet\r\nthrough Macedonia to the Ægean Sea.  They have been constantly\r\nthreatened by their neighbours on the south-east and south-west with\r\nexclusion altogether from the Adriatic, their only outlet to the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nFrom the economic point of view, one cannot {127} but have sympathy\r\nwith the determination of the Austrians and Hungarians to prevent the\r\ndisaster which would certainly come to them, if the aspirations of\r\nItalian and Servian irredentism were realized.  The severity of Hungary\r\nagainst Croatia and the oppression of the Servians in\r\nBosnia-Herzegovina and Dalmatia by Austria have been dictated by the\r\nsame reasons which led England and Scotland to attempt to destroy the\r\nnational spirit of Ireland for so many centuries after they had robbed\r\nher of her independence.  They could not afford to have their\r\ncommunications by sea threatened by the presence and growth of an\r\nindependent nation, especially since this nation was believed to be\r\nsusceptible to the influence of hereditary enemies.\r\n\r\nIt has been fortunate for Austria-Hungary that the claims of the\r\nirredentists at the head of the Adriatic have overlapped and come into\r\nconflict in almost the same way that the claims of Greece and Bulgaria\r\nhave come into conflict in Macedonia.  From time immemorial, the\r\nItalian and Greek peoples, owing to their position on peninsulas, have\r\nbeen seafaring.  Consequently, it is they who have developed the\r\ncommercial life of ports in the eastern Mediterranean.  Everywhere\r\nalong the littoral of the Ægean and the Adriatic, Greeks and Italians\r\nhave founded and inhabited, up to the present day, the chief ports.\r\nBut, by the same token, those engaged in commercial and maritime\r\noccupations have never been excellent farmers, shepherds, or woodsmen.\r\nSo, while the Italians and Greeks have held the predominance in the\r\ncities of the littoral, the {128} _hinterland_ has been occupied by\r\nother races.  Just as the _hinterland_ of Macedonia is very largely\r\nBulgarian, the _hinterland_ of the upper end of the Adriatic is very\r\nlargely Slavic.  Just as the realization of the dreams of Hellenic\r\nirredentists would give Greece a narrow strip of coast line along\r\nEuropean Turkey to Constantinople, with one or two of the larger inland\r\ncommercial cities, while the Slavs would be cut off entirely from the\r\nsea, the realization of the dreams of Italian irredentists would give\r\nto Italy the ports and coast line of the northern end of the Adriatic,\r\nwith no _hinterland_, and the Slavs, Hungarians, and Germans an\r\nenormous _hinterland_ with no ports.\r\n\r\nItalian irredentism, in so far as the Tyrol goes, is not unreasonable.\r\nBut its realization in Istria and the Adriatic littoral is\r\nimpracticable.  Our modern idea of a state is of people living together\r\nin a political union that is to their economic advantage.  Only the\r\nthoughtless enthusiasts could advocate a change in the map of Europe by\r\nwhich fifty million people would be cut off from the sea to satisfy the\r\nnational aspirations of a few hundred thousand Italians.\r\n\r\nThe Italian Society _Dante Alighieri_ has gotten into the hands of the\r\nirredentists, and, before the Tripolitan conquest, was successful in\r\ninfluencing members of Parliament to embarrass the Government by\r\ninterpellations concerning the troubles of Italians who are Austrian\r\nsubjects.  This society has advocated for Italy the adoption of a law\r\nso modifying the legislation on naturalization that Italians who\r\nemigrate can preserve their nationality even if they acquire that of\r\nthe countries to which they have gone.  {129} It was a curious\r\nanticipation of the famous Article XXV, of the German Citizenship Law\r\nof 1914.  In 1911, a Lombard deputy tried to raise the old cry of alarm\r\nconcerning German penetration into Italy, and emphasized the necessity\r\nof the return to the policy of the Ghibelline motto, \"_Fuori i\r\nTedeschi_\"--\"Expel the Germans.\"\r\n\r\nItalian statesmen, however, have never given serious attention to the\r\nclaims of the irredentists.  The late Marquis di San Giuliano deplored\r\ntheir senseless and harmful manifestations.  In trying for the\r\nimpossible, and keeping up an agitation that tended to make friction\r\nbetween Italy and Austria-Hungary, he pointed out that they harmed what\r\nwere the real and _attainable_ Italian interests.\r\n\r\nThe antagonism between Italy and Austria-Hungary has had deeper and\r\nmore logical and justifiable foundation than irredentism.  The two\r\nnations have been apprehensive each about allowing the other to gain\r\ncontrol of the Adriatic.  Up to 1903, Spezzia was the naval base for\r\nthe whole of Italy.  Since that time, Tarento has become one of the\r\nfirst military ports, important fortifications have been placed at\r\nBrindisi, Bari, and Ancona, and an elaborate scheme has been drawn up\r\nfor the defence of Venice.  The Venetians have been demanding that\r\nVenice become a naval base.\r\n\r\nItalian naval and maritime activity having increased in the Adriatic,\r\nthere has naturally been more intense opposition and rivalry between\r\nthe two Adriatic Powers over Albania.  The spread of Austro-Hungarian\r\ninfluence has been bitterly fought {130} by the Italian propaganda.\r\nThis problem was becoming a serious one for the statesmen of the two\r\nnations while Albania was still under Turkish rule.  Since, at the\r\njoint wish of Italy and Austria-Hungary, Albania has been brought into\r\nthe family of European nations, the question of the equilibrium of the\r\nAdriatic has only become more unsettled.  For free Albania turned out\r\nto be a fiasco.\r\n\r\nIf the relations between Austria-Hungary, fighting for life, and her\r\npassive ally of the Triple Alliance have become more strained since the\r\nEuropean war began, let it be hoped for the future stability of Europe\r\nthat it has not been because Italian irredentism has gained the upper\r\nhand at Rome.  For if Italy were to intervene in the war for the\r\npurpose of taking away from Austria-Hungary the Adriatic littoral\r\ninhabited by Italians, she would be menacing her own future, and that\r\nof Switzerland as well.  To entertain the hope of taking and keeping\r\nTrieste would be folly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{131}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE DANUBE AND THE DARDANELLES\r\n\r\nThe River Danube and the Straits leading from the Black Sea to the\r\nÆgean Sea have been the waterways of Europe whose fortunes have had the\r\ngreatest influence upon the evolution of international relations during\r\nthe last half century.  The control of these two waterways, as long as\r\nthe Ottoman Empire remained strong, was not a question of compelling\r\ninterest to Europe.  It was only when the decline of the Ottoman power\r\nbegan to foreshadow the eventual disappearance of the empire from\r\nEurope that nations began to think of the vital importance of the\r\ncontrol of these waterways to the economic life of Europe.\r\n\r\nThere is an extensive and interesting literature on the history of the\r\nevolution of international law in its relationship to the various\r\nquestions raised by the necessarily international control of the Danube\r\nand the Dardanelles.  In a book like this, an adequate statement of the\r\nhistory and work of the Danube Commission, and of the various\r\ndiplomatic negotiations affecting the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles,\r\ntheir freedom of passage, their fortifications, their {132}\r\nlighthouses, and their life-saving stations, cannot be attempted.  It\r\nis my intention, therefore, to treat these great waterways only in the\r\nbroader aspect of the important part that the questions raised by them\r\nhave played in leading up to the gigantic struggle which foreshadows a\r\nnew political reconstruction of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Danube is navigable from Germany all the way to the Black Sea.  On\r\nits banks are the capitals of Austria, Hungary, and Servia.  It\r\ntraverses the entire Austro-Hungarian Empire, forms a natural boundary\r\nbetween Austria and Servia, Rumania and Bulgaria, and then turns north\r\nacross Rumania to separate for a short distance Rumania and Russia\r\nbefore finally reaching the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nThe volume of traffic on the Danube has increased steadily since the\r\nCrimean War.  It has become the great path of export for Austrian and\r\nHungarian merchandise to the Balkan States, Russia, Turkey, and Persia,\r\nand for Servian, Bulgarian, and Rumanian products to Russia and Turkey.\r\nThe passenger service on the Danube has kept pace with the competition\r\nof the railways.  Eastward, it is frequently quicker, cheaper, and more\r\nconvenient than the railway service.  You can leave Vienna or\r\nBuda-Pesth in the evening, and reach Buda-Pesth or Belgrade in the\r\nmorning.  From Belgrade to the Hungarian and Rumanian frontier towns,\r\nthe Danube furnishes the shortest route.  From Bulgaria to Russia, the\r\nDanube route, via Somovit and Galatz to Odessa, is in many ways\r\npreferable to the through train service.  It is by spending days on the\r\nDanube that I have come to {133} realize how vital the river is to\r\nfreight and passenger communications between Austria-Hungary, the\r\nBalkan states, and Russia.  Travel gives life and meaning to\r\nstatistics.  The Danube interprets itself.\r\n\r\nThe Congresses of Paris and Berlin considered carefully the entrance of\r\nthe Danube question into international life through the enfranchisement\r\nof the Balkan States.  International laws, administered by an\r\ninternational commission, govern the Danube.  It is a neutral waterway.\r\nProblems, similar to those of the Scheldt, have arisen, however, in the\r\npresent war between Austria-Hungary and Servia.  If Rumania and\r\nBulgaria should join in the European war, no matter on which side they\r\nshould fight, the whole Danube question would become further\r\ncomplicated.  When war actually breaks out, the rulings of\r\ninternational law concerning neutrality are invariably violated.\r\nStates act according to their own interests.\r\n\r\nIn its larger European aspect, the Danube, as an international\r\nwaterway, is dependent upon the Dardanelles.  Were Rumania to close the\r\nnavigation of the Danube, or were she to preserve its neutrality, she\r\nwould only be preventing or assisting the commerce of the riverain\r\nstates with the Black Sea.  Unobstructed passage to the outside world\r\nfor Danube commerce depends upon the control of the outlet from the\r\nBlack Sea to the Ægean Sea.  The Hungarian and Servian peasant looks\r\nbeyond his own great river to the narrow passage from the Sea of\r\nMarmora.  The question of the Danube is subordinated to the question of\r\nthe Dardanelles.\r\n\r\nThat the passage from the Black Sea to the outside {134} world remain\r\nopen and secure from sudden stoppage or constant menace is of vital\r\nimportance to the riverain Danube states, Austria-Hungary and Servia,\r\nto the states bordering the Black Sea, Russia, Rumania, and Turkey, and\r\nto Persia, whose nearest communications with Europe are by way of the\r\nBlack Sea.  Austria-Hungary, however, has another outlet through the\r\nAdriatic, Servia is pressing towards the Adriatic and the Ægean,\r\nBulgaria has recently secured an Ægean littoral, Persia is dependent\r\nupon Russia, and Turkey holds the straits.  There remain Russia and\r\nRumania, to whom the question of the Dardanelles is a matter of life\r\nand death.\r\n\r\nThe international position of Rumania is most unfortunate.  She must\r\nmake common cause with Germanic Europe or with Turkey to prevent her\r\nonly waterway to the outside world from falling into the hands of\r\nRussia, or she must ally herself with Russia, and, by adding Bukovina\r\nand Transylvania, increase her numbers to the point where she can hope\r\nto resist the tide of Slavs around her.  In discussing the neutrality\r\nof Rumania, the French and British press have given too much emphasis\r\nto the loyalty of King Carol for the Hohenzollern family, of which he\r\nwas a member, as the cause of the failure of Rumania to join the\r\nenemies of the Germanic Powers, and to the hope that the death of the\r\nsovereign who made Rumania may result in a favourable change in the\r\npolicy of the Bukarest Cabinet.  The new sovereign, King Ferdinand, is\r\nalso a Hohenzollern.  The hesitation of Rumania has not been, and is\r\nnot, primarily because of the family ties of her rulers.  {135} The\r\nRumanians in Hungary may call for union with their enfranchised\r\nbrethren, just as the Italians in Austria may call for union with the\r\nItalians who were liberated in 1859 and 1866.  But is irredentism the\r\nonly factor in influencing the policy of Italy and Rumania?  For\r\nRumania, at least, the hope of acquiring Transylvania and Bukovina in\r\nthe international settlement following the war is offset by the\r\napprehension of seeing Russia at the Dardanelles.\r\n\r\nThe Dardanelles has been the scene of struggles for commercial\r\nsupremacy since the days of the Peloponnesian wars.  It was in the\r\nDardanelles that the great battle was fought which brought about the\r\ndownfall of Athenian hegemony.  It was over the question of fortifying\r\nthe island of Tenedos that Venice and Genoa in the latter half of the\r\nfourteenth century fought the war during which the Genoese occupation\r\nof Chioggia nearly caused the destruction of Venice.  Then came the\r\nOttoman occupation to put a stop to international jealousies until\r\nmodern times.\r\n\r\nThe political development of Russia from Moscow has been a consistent\r\nforward march towards ocean waterways.  There have been six possible\r\noutlets for Russia, the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, the White Sea, the\r\nYellow Sea, the Persian Gulf, and the Adriatic.  At different periods\r\nof her history, Russia has expended her efforts continuously in these\r\nvarious directions.  To reach the Baltic, Peter the Great built\r\nPetrograd.  One has to stand on the Kremlin on a beautiful summer day\r\nand look out over the sacred city of the Russians to grasp the fulness\r\nof {136} the sacrifice and the marvellous daring of the man who\r\nabandoned Moscow to build another capital on piles driven into dreary\r\nsalt marshes.  It was for the sea and contact with the outside world!\r\nTo reach the Pacific Ocean, Russia patiently conquered the former\r\nempire of the Mongols, steppe by steppe, and when she thought the\r\nmoment of realization had arrived, did not hesitate to throw a band of\r\nsteel across the continent of Asia.  To reach the Persian Gulf, she\r\ncrossed the Caucasus and launched her ships upon the Caspian Sea.  To\r\nreach the Black Sea, she broke the military power of the houses of\r\nJagello and Osman, building laboriously upon the ruins of Poland and\r\nthe Ottoman Empire.  Is it to reach the Adriatic that her forces are\r\nnow before Przemysl?\r\n\r\nIn spite of her struggles through three centuries, Russia is still\r\nlandlocked.  The ice is an insurmountable barrier to freedom of exit\r\nfrom the White Sea, her only undisputed outlet.  Japan has arisen to\r\nshatter the dreams of the future of Port Dalny, and make useless the\r\nsacrifices to gain the Pacific.  The control by Germany of the exit\r\nfrom the Baltic Sea has been strengthened in recent years by the\r\nconstruction and fortification of the Kiel Canal.  The Persian Gulf has\r\nbeen given up by the accord of 1907 with Great Britain.  There has\r\nremained what has always been the strongest hope, and the one for the\r\nrealization of which Russia has made consistent and stupendous efforts.\r\n\r\nRadetsky, in his memoirs, has summed up the attitude of Russia towards\r\nthe Ottoman Empire in {137} words that give the key to the whole\r\nEastern Question during the past century:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Owing to her geographical position, Russia is the national and eternal\r\nenemy of Turkey....  Russia must therefore do all she can to take\r\npossession of Constantinople, for its possession alone will grant to\r\nher the security and territorial completeness necessary for her future.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThree times during the nineteenth century Russia endeavoured to destroy\r\nthe Ottoman Empire in Europe so that she might gain control of the exit\r\nto the Ægean Sea.  In 1828, her armies reached Adrianople, and half a\r\ncentury later the suburbs of Constantinople.  In both instances,\r\nespecially the second, it was the opposition of Great Britain that\r\nforced Russia to make peace without having attained her end.  In 1854,\r\nFrance and Italy joined Great Britain in the invasion of the Crimea to\r\npreserve \"the integrity of the Ottoman Empire.\"  In 1856, at the\r\nCongress of Paris, Russia saw the western Powers uphold the principle\r\nthat the Czar had no right to sovereignty even on the Black Sea, a half\r\nof which his ancestors had wrested from the Turks.  It was no use for\r\nRussia to plead that she had \"special interests\" in her own territorial\r\nwaters.  The Black Sea was neutralized.  The expression \"_selon nos\r\nconvenances et intérêts_\" was understood by Great Britain to refer only\r\nto British interests!  It was by right of might that Russia was held in\r\ncheck.  In 1870, Bismarck purchased the neutrality of Russia in his war\r\nagainst France by agreeing to Russia's {138} denunciation of the Paris\r\ntreaty clauses which held her impotent in the Black Sea.  But again, in\r\n1878, Great Britain interfered to bottle up Russia.  Since then the\r\nRussian navy has been a prisoner in the Black Sea.  Will it continue to\r\nbe so after the war of 1914?\r\n\r\nJust when Ottoman power was receding, the rapid development of steam\r\npower began to make southern Russia the bread basket of Europe.  Steam\r\nmachinery increased the yield of these vast and rich lands, steam\r\nrailways enabled the farmers to send their harvests to Black Sea ports,\r\nand steamships made possible the distribution of the harvests\r\nthroughout Europe.  I used to live on the Bosphorus, and from my study\r\nwindow I could see every day the never-ceasing procession of grain\r\nships of all nations going to and coming from the Black Sea.  In May,\r\n1912, when the Dardanelles was closed for a month during the Italian\r\nwar, two hundred steamships lay at anchor in the harbour of\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nAnother influence whose importance cannot be overestimated has\r\nconstantly turned the eyes of Russians towards Constantinople.  Slavs\r\nare idealists.  For an ideal, one makes sacrifices that material\r\nconsiderations do not call forth.  To the Russians, Constantinople is\r\nTsarigrad, the city of the Emperor.  It is from Constantinople that the\r\nRussians received their religion.  Their civilization is imbued with\r\nthe spirit of Byzantium.  Just as one sees in the Polish language the\r\ninfluence of Latin in the construction of the sentence, one sees in the\r\nkindred Russian tongue the influence of Greek.  I have frequently been\r\nstruck {139} with the close and vital relationship between\r\nConstantinople and Russia during the period of the development of the\r\nRussian nation.  _Now that Russia seems to be entering upon a period of\r\nnational awakening, the sentiment is bound to be irresistible among the\r\nRussians that they are the rightful inheritors of the Eastern Empire,\r\neclipsed for so many centuries by the shadow of Islam and now about to\r\nbe born again_.\r\n\r\nOn a July evening in 1908, when the constitutional revolution in Turkey\r\nwas beginning to occupy the attention of Europe, I sat with my wife in\r\nthe winter garden of the Grand Hotel in Paris.  We were listening to a\r\ncharming and intelligent Russian gentleman explain to us the aims of\r\nthe political parties in the Duma of 1907.  A waiter came to tell us\r\nthat our baggage was ready.  \"Where are you going?\" asked the Russian.\r\n\"To Constantinople,\" we answered.  An expression of wistful sadness or\r\njoy--you can never tell which it is meant to be with a Russian--came\r\nacross his face.  \"Constantinople!\" he murmured, more to himself than\r\nto us: \"This revolution will fail.  You will see.  For we must come\r\ninto our own.\"\r\n\r\nThe political aspect of the question of the Dardanelles has changed\r\ngreatly since Great Britain and France fought one war with Russia, and\r\nGreat Britain stood ready to fight a second, in order to prevent this\r\npassage from falling into Russian hands.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after the crisis of San Stefano and the resulting\r\nrevision of the Russo-Turkish treaty at Berlin, the interests of Great\r\nBritain were diverted from the north-east to the south-east {140}\r\nMediterranean.  She decided that her permanent route to India was\r\nthrough the Suez Canal, and made it secure by getting possession of the\r\nmajority of the shares of the Canal and by seizing Egypt.  The\r\nBulgarians began to show themselves lacking in the expected docility\r\ntowards their liberator.  British diplomats realized that they had been\r\nfearing what did not happen.  They began to lose interest in the\r\nDardanelles.  This loss of interest in the question of the straits as a\r\nvital factor in their world interests has grown so complete in recent\r\nyears that Russia has no reason to anticipate another visit of the\r\nBritish fleet to Besika Bay if--I refrain from prophesying.  It is safe\r\nto say, however, that London has forgotten Mohammed Ali, the Crimea,\r\nand the Princes' Islands, while the traditions of Unkiar Skelessi are\r\nstill dominating the foreign policy of Petrograd.\r\n\r\nFor, while the future of the Dardanelles has come to mean less to Great\r\nBritain, it means more than ever before to Russia.  Russia has been\r\nturned back from the Pacific.  The loss of Manchuria in the war with\r\nJapan caused her once again to cast her eyes upon the outlet to the\r\nMediterranean.  To the increase in her wheat trade has been added also\r\nthe development of the petroleum trade from the Caucasus wells.  Since\r\nthe agreement for the partition of Persia with Great Britain in 1907,\r\nand the mutual \"hands off\" accord with Germany at Potsdam in 1910, the\r\nexpectations of a brilliant Russian future for northern Persia and the\r\nArmenian and Kurdish corner of Asiatic Turkey have been great.\r\n\r\n{141}\r\n\r\nSince the Congress of Berlin, Germany has come into the place of Great\r\nBritain as the enemy who would keep Russia from finding the Ægean Sea.\r\nThe growth of German interests at Constantinople and in Asia Minor has\r\nbecome the India--in anticipation--of Germany.  When Russia, after her\r\nill-fated venture in the Far East, turned her efforts once more towards\r\nthe Balkan peninsula, it began to dawn upon her that the _Drang nach\r\nOesten_ might prove a menace to her control of the Dardanelles, fully\r\nas great as was formerly the British fetish of the integrity of the\r\nOttoman Empire to keep open the route to India.  Diplomacy endeavoured\r\nto ward off the inevitable struggle.  But the Balkan wars created a new\r\nsituation that broke rudely the accords of Skierniewice and Potsdam.\r\nAustria-Hungary in the Balkans and Germany in Asia Minor became the\r\nnightmare of Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{142}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nAUSTRIA-HUNGARY AND HER SOUTH SLAVS\r\n\r\nIt has often been predicted in recent years that the union between\r\nAustria and Hungary would be broken by internal troubles.  Hungary has\r\nbeen credited with desiring to cut loose from Austria.  The frequent\r\nand serious quarrels between the members of the Dual Monarchy have\r\ncaused many a wiseacre to shake his head and say, \"The union will not\r\noutlive Franz Josef!\"  But the Austro-Hungarian Empire has been founded\r\nupon sound political and economic principles, which far transcend a\r\nsingle life or a dynasty.  Austrians and Hungarians may be unwilling\r\nyoke-fellows.  But they know that if they do not pull together, they\r\ncannot pull at all.  They have too many Slavs around them.\r\n\r\nThe principle upon which Austrians and Hungarians have founded a Dual\r\nMonarchy is the old Latin proverb, _divide et impera_.  In the Empire,\r\nAustrians and Hungarians are in the minority.  In each kingdom, by\r\ndividing the Slavs cleverly between them, they hold the upper hand.\r\nThe German race is, {143} therefore, the dominant race in Austria, and\r\nthe Hungarian race is the dominant race in Hungary.\r\n\r\nIf one looks at the map, and studies the division of the Empire, he\r\nwill readily see that it is much more durably constructed than he would\r\nhave reason to believe from statistics of the population.  _The Slavic\r\nquestion in the Dual Monarchy is not how many Slavs of kindred races\r\nare to be found in Austria-Hungary, but how they are placed in\r\nrelationship to each other and to neighbouring states_.  It is a\r\nquestion of geography rather than of census.  The student needs a map\r\ninstead of columns of figures.\r\n\r\nIn only one place is the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy very weak, and that\r\nis in the south.  The sole port for the thirty millions of Austria is\r\nTrieste.  To reach Trieste one passes through a belt of Slavic\r\nterritory, and Trieste itself is more Italian than German.  The sole\r\nport of Hungary is Fiume.  To reach Fiume one passes through a belt of\r\nSlavic territory, and there are hardly any Hungarians in Fiume itself.\r\nThe Slavs which cut off Fiume from Hungary and the Slavs of the\r\nDalmatian coast and of all Bosnia and Herzegovina belong to the same\r\nfamily.  They speak practically the same language as the Servians and\r\nMontenegrins.\r\n\r\nThe Hungarians, then, have exactly the same interest as the Austrians\r\nin every move that has been made since the proclamation of the\r\nconstitution of Turkey to prevent the foundation of a strong\r\nindependent Servian State on the confines of the {144} Austro-Hungarian\r\nEmpire, and to prevent the Slavs from reaching the Adriatic Sea.\r\n\r\nAustria has not been necessarily influenced in her attitude towards the\r\nBalkan problem by Germany.  Although her _Drang nach Osten_ is\r\nfrequently interpreted as a part of the Pan-Germanic movement, the\r\nGermans of Austria have needed no German sentiment and no German\r\nprompting to arrive at their point of view in regard to the Balkan\r\nnationalities.  It must be clearly kept in mind that the Convention of\r\nReichstadt in 1876, which was the beginning of Austria's consistent\r\npolicy towards the Balkan peninsula, was signed before the alliance\r\nwith Germany; that it was the conception of a _Hungarian_ statesman,\r\nand that _the occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina had nothing whatever\r\nto do with Pan-Germanism_.  It was a measure of self-protection to\r\nprevent these remote provinces of Turkey from forming a political union\r\nwith Servia, should the Russian arms, intervening on behalf of the\r\nsouth Slavs against Turkey, prove successful.  The extension of\r\nsovereignty over Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1908 was to prevent the\r\nconstitutional _régime_ from trying to weaken the hold of\r\nAustria-Hungary upon these provinces.  Austria-Hungary certainly would\r\nhave preferred the more comfortable status of an occupation to the\r\nlegal adoption of a _Reichsland_.  But she could take no chances with\r\nthe Young Turks.  Her military occupation of the _Sandjak_ of Novi\r\nBazar was inspired as much by the necessity of preventing the union of\r\nMontenegro and Servia as by the desire to provide for a future railway\r\nextension to Salonika.\r\n\r\n{145}\r\n\r\nHungary has had to grapple with two Balkan problems, the rise of\r\nRumania and the rise of Servia.  She has had within her kingdom several\r\nmillion Rumanian subjects and several million South Slavic subjects.\r\nMost of her Rumanians, however, have been separated from Rumania from\r\nthe natural barrier of the Carpathian mountains, and have not found\r\ntheir union with Hungary to their disadvantage.  For the Rumanians of\r\nHungary enjoy through Buda-Pesth and Fiume a better outlet to the\r\nmarkets of the world, and a cheaper haul, than they would find through\r\nRumania.  They have benefited greatly by their economic union with\r\nHungary.  It is not the same with the Croatians.  They are situated\r\nbetween Buda-Pesth and the Adriatic.  They have a natural river outlet\r\nto the Danube.  They are not separated by physical barriers from their\r\nbrothers of race and language in Servia, Bosnia, and Dalmatia.  Were\r\nthey to separate from Hungary, they would not find their economic\r\nposition in any way jeopardized.\r\n\r\nMany South Slavs have advocated a trialism to replace the present\r\ndualism.  They have claimed that the most critical problems of the\r\nAustro-Hungarian Empire could be solved in this way.  Added to Hungary\r\nand Austria, there could be a Servian kingdom, perhaps enlarged by the\r\ninclusion of independent Servia and Montenegro, whose crown could be\r\nworn by the Hapsburg ruler.\r\n\r\nBut this solution has never found favour, simple and attractive though\r\nit sounds on first sight, with {146} either Hungarians or Austrians.\r\nFor it would mean the cutting off of both kingdoms from the sea.  The\r\nHungarians would be altogether land-locked, and surrounded on all sides\r\nby alien races.  Austria would be forced into hopeless economic\r\ndependence upon Germany.  The Germans of Austria and the Hungarians of\r\nHungary have felt that their national existence depended upon keeping\r\nin political subjection the South Slavs, and upon repressing\r\nmercilessly any evidences of Italian irredentism upon the littoral of\r\nthe Adriatic.  Italian irredentism is treated in another place.  The\r\nrepression of national aspirations among the South Slavs, which\r\ninterests us here, has been the corner-stone of Austro-Hungarian policy\r\nin the Balkans.  For Hungary it has also been an internal question in\r\nher relationship with Croatia.\r\n\r\nThe Serbo-Croatian movement in southern Hungary has been repressed by\r\nHungary with the same bitterness and lack of success that have attended\r\nthe attempts to stifle national aspirations elsewhere in Europe.  No\r\nweapon has been left unused in fighting nationalism in Croatia.\r\nOfficial corruption, bribery, manipulation of judges, imprisonment\r\nwithout trial, military despotism, gerrymandering, electoral\r\nintimidation,--this has been for years and is still, the daily record\r\nin Croatia.  If there were a Slavic Silvio Pellico, the world would\r\nknow that the ministers of the aged Franz Josef are not very different\r\nfrom the ministers of the young Franz Josef, who crushed the Milanese\r\nand tracked Garibaldi like a beast.  Radetzkys and Gorzkowskis are\r\nstill wearing {147} Austrian livery.  To Austria and Hungary, Salonika\r\nand Macedonia may have been the dream.  But Trieste, Fiume, and\r\nDalmatia have always been the realities.  If Hungary took her heel off\r\nthe neck of the Croatians, Buda-Pesth might become another Belgrade and\r\nHungary another Servia, land-locked with no other outlet than the\r\nDanube.  This does not excuse, but it explains.  In this world the\r\nbattle is to the strong.  The survival of the fittest is a historical\r\nas well as a biological fact.\r\n\r\nIn spite of their juxtaposition, the Serbo-Croats have never been able\r\nto unite.  There have been more reasons for this than their political\r\nseparation.  They are divided in religion.  The Servians are Orthodox,\r\nand the Croatians and Dalmatians Catholic.  In Bosnia and Macedonia,\r\nthe race adhered to both confessions, though in majority Orthodox, and\r\nhas also a strong Mohammedan element.  The Orthodox Servians of Servia\r\nuse the Cyrillic alphabet, and the Catholic Croatians and Dalmatians of\r\nAustria-Hungary the Latin alphabet.\r\n\r\nUntil the recent Balkan Wars, the Croatians and Dalmatians considered\r\nthemselves a much superior branch of the race to the Servians.  They\r\nhave certainly enjoyed a superior education and demonstrated a superior\r\ncivilization.  The probable reason for this is that they did not have\r\nthe misfortune to be for centuries under the Ottoman yoke.  The\r\nCroatians have never been willing to play the understudy to the\r\nServians.  Agram has considered itself the centre of the Serbo-Croat\r\nmovement rather than Belgrade.  {148} It is a far more beautiful and\r\nmodern city than Belgrade.  Few cities of all Europe of its size can\r\nequal Agram for architecture, for municipal works, and for keen,\r\nstimulating intellectual life.  Its university is the _foyer_ of\r\nSerbo-Croat nationalism and of _risorgimento_ literature.  It was here\r\nthat the one Roman bishop of the world, who dared to speak openly in\r\nthe Vatican Council of 1870 against the doctrine of papal infallibility\r\nand remain within the Church, gave to his people the prophetic message\r\nthat nationality transcended creeds.  Here also another Catholic priest\r\ntaught the oneness of Servians and Croatians in language and history,\r\nand proved by scholarly research which is universally admired, that\r\nCroatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia formed a triune kingdom, whose juridic\r\nunion with the Austro-Hungarian Empire was wholly personal connection\r\nwith the Hapsburg Crown, and had never been subjection to the Magyar.\r\nThe Hungarians, during the past few years of bitterest persecution at\r\nAgram, have not been able to drive away the ghosts of Strossmayer and\r\nRacki.  In Croatia, the pen has proved mightier than the sword.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, Austria-Hungary has not felt uneasy about the\r\nrelationship between the Croatians and the Servians of the independent\r\nkingdom.  But there has never been a minute since the annexation of\r\n1908 that the statesmen of the Ballplatz have not been nervous about\r\nthe Servian propaganda in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  To keep Catholic\r\nCroatians and Orthodox Servians in {149} antagonism with each other and\r\nwith the Moslems, to prevent the education and economic emancipation of\r\nthe Orthodox peasants, and to introduce German colonists and German\r\nindustrial enterprises everywhere, has been the Austro-Hungarian\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nVienna has used the Catholic Church and the propaganda of Catholic\r\nmissions for dividing the Orthodox Servians in Bosnia from their\r\nCroatian brothers of the Catholic rite.  Missionaries give every\r\nencouragement to Servians to desert the Orthodox Church.  In the\r\ngreater part of Bosnia, the Government has made it absolutely\r\nimpossible for a child to receive an education elsewhere than in the\r\nCatholic schools.  There are only two hundred and sixty-eight schools\r\nsupported by the Government, of which one-tenth are placed in such a\r\nway that they serve exclusively other populations.  The Bosnian budget\r\nprovides four times as much money for the maintenance of the\r\n_gendarmerie_ as for public schools.\r\n\r\nMoslem law provides that all conquered land belongs to the Khalif.  He\r\nfarms it out in annual, life, or hereditary grants.  In the Ottoman\r\nconquest of the Balkan Peninsula, the territories acquired were granted\r\nto successful soldiers on a basis which provided for a feudal army.\r\nThe feudal proprietors, or _beys_, left the land to the peasants who\r\noccupied it, in consideration of an annual rental of a third of the\r\nyield of the land.  The peasants had in addition to pay their tenth to\r\nthe tax collectors of the Sultan.  In territories that were on the\r\nborders of the Ottoman {150} Empire, like Bosnia and Albania, the lands\r\nwere largely retained by their former proprietors, who became Moslems.\r\nSo the landed aristocracy remained indigenous.\r\n\r\nThe lot of the peasants in Bosnia, who were largely Orthodox Servians\r\nwas not intolerable under Turkish rule, except when Moslem fanaticism\r\nwas aroused by Christian separatist propaganda.  Austria-Hungary\r\nclaimed, however, that her occupation of the province was a measure\r\ndictated by humanity to ameliorate the lot of the enslaved Christians.\r\nBut the Austrian administration has accomplished just the opposite.\r\nThe new government from the beginning supported its authority upon the\r\nMoslem landowners, upon whose good-will they were dependent to prevent\r\nthe awakening of national feeling among the peasants.  Vienna was more\r\ncomplacent in overlooking abuses of the _beys_ than had been\r\nConstantinople.  For the Turks held their _beys_ in check when\r\nexactions grew too bad.  The Sublime Porte was afraid of giving an\r\nexcuse for Christian intervention.  But the Austrians encouraged the\r\nexactions of the _beys_ in order to keep in abject subjection the\r\nServian peasant population.\r\n\r\nFrom the first moment of the Austro-Hungarian occupation, the peasants\r\nfound that they would no longer enjoy undisturbed possession of their\r\nlands.  The exodus of Mohammedan Bosnians, who, as we have seen\r\nelsewhere, were urged to follow the Ottoman flag, gave the Germans the\r\nopportunity of settling colonists on the vacated lands.  This process\r\n{151} of colonization was afterwards pursued to the detriment of the\r\nindigenous Christian population.  Ernest Haeckel, the great\r\nphilosopher, once said in a lecture at Jena that \"the work of the\r\nGerman people to assure and develop civilization gives it the right to\r\noccupy the Balkans, Asia Minor, Syria, and Mesopotamia, and to exclude\r\nfrom these countries the races actually occupying them which are\r\npowerless and incapable.\"  This statement, publicly made before a body\r\nof distinguished German thinkers, reveals the real ulterior ideal of\r\nthe _Drang nach Osten_.  Professor Wirth, dealing specifically with\r\npresent possibilities, stated that the policy of Austria-Hungary in\r\nBosnia must be to keep the peasantry in slavery and, as much as\r\npossible, to encourage them by oppression to emigrate.  The reason\r\ngiven for this was: \"_To render powerful the Bosnian peasant is to\r\nrender powerful the Servian people, which would be the suicide of\r\nGermany._\"  Can we not see from this how public sentiment in Germany\r\nhas stood behind the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Servia?\r\n\r\nFrom 1890 to 1914, the theory of Haeckel and the advice of Wirth have\r\nbeen followed by the Austrian functionaries in Bosnia.  No stone has\r\nbeen left unturned to drive the peasants from their lands.  Right of\r\ninheritance has been suppressed, a tax collector has been introduced\r\nbetween the bey and his peasants, the taxes have been raised in many\r\ncases arbitrarily to the point where the peasants have been compelled\r\nto abandon their land.  To German immigrants have been given {152}\r\ncommunal lands which were necessary to the peasants for pasturage and\r\nthe forests where their swine fed on acorns.\r\n\r\nThe population of Bosnia hardly surpasses thirty-five inhabitants to\r\nthe kilometre.  The total population is about two millions, of whom\r\neight hundred thousand are Orthodox, six hundred thousand Moslem, and\r\nfive hundred thousand Catholic.  But practically all of this\r\npopulation--except one hundred thousand who are Jews, Protestants, and\r\nother German immigrants--is Servian or Servian-speaking.  There are\r\nthirty-five thousand Germans, as opposed to one million eight hundred\r\nthousand Slavs.  And yet German is the language of the administration,\r\nand the only language of the railways and posts and telegraphs, which\r\nin Bosnia have not ceased to be under the control of the military\r\ngovernment.  Many functionaries after thirty years of service in Bosnia\r\ndo not know the language of the country.  Two German newspapers are\r\nsupported at the expense of the public budget to attack indigenous\r\nelements.  In German schools, pupils are taught the history of Germany,\r\nbut in Slavic schools the history of the south Slavs is excluded from\r\nthe curriculum.  There are fourteen schools for ten thousand Germans,\r\nand one school for every six thousand Slavs.\r\n\r\nIn the administration of Bosnia, only thirty-one out of three hundred\r\nand twenty-two functionaries are Servians, only twelve out of one\r\nhundred and twenty-five professors of lyceums, only thirty-one out of\r\ntwo hundred and thirty-seven judges and {153} magistrates.  And yet the\r\nOrthodox Servians form forty-four per cent. of the population.  The\r\nyoung Bosnians who have graduated from the Austro-Hungarian\r\nuniversities find themselves excluded from public life.  Turning to\r\ncommercial life, they find eighty per cent. of the large industries\r\ncontrolled by German capital and managed exclusively by Germans.\r\nTurning to agriculture, they find economic misery and hopeless\r\nignorance among the peasants of their race, and every effort made by\r\nthe Government to prevent the bettering of their lot.  Turning to\r\njournalism and public speaking to work for their race, they find an\r\nunreasoning censorship and a law against assemblies.  As one of them\r\nexpressed it to me, \"We must either cease to be Slavs or become\r\nrevolutionaries.\"\r\n\r\nDid Austria-Hungary need to look to Servian propaganda, to influences\r\n_from the outside_, to find the cause of the assassination of Franz\r\nFerdinand?  Political assassinations were not new in the south Slavic\r\nprovinces of the monarchy.  A young Bosnian student attempted to\r\nassassinate the Governor of Bosnia at Sarajevo on June 6, 1910, at the\r\ntime of the inauguration of the Bosnian _Sabor_ (Diet).  Two years\r\nlater the royal commissioner in Croatia was the object of an attempt at\r\nassassination by a Bosnian at Agram.  In September of the same year, a\r\nCroatian student shot at the Ban of Croatia.  The same Ban, Skerletz,\r\nwas attacked again at Agram by another young Croatian on August 18,\r\n1913.  These assassinations preceded those of the Archduke and his\r\nwife.  They {154} were all committed by students of Austro-Hungarian\r\nnationality.  Only the last one had ever been in Servia.\r\n\r\nIn theory, Bosnia has had since February 20, 1910, a constitution with\r\na deliberative assembly.  But the _Sabor_ can discuss no projects of\r\nlaw that have not been proposed by the two masters.  Once voted, a law\r\nhas to pass the double veto of Vienna and Buda-Pesth.  As if this were\r\nnot enough, the Viennese bureaucracy has so arranged the qualification\r\nof the electorate and the electoral laws that the suffrage does not\r\nrepresent the country.  Then, too, the constitution decides arbitrarily\r\nthat the membership of the _Sabor_ must be divided according to\r\nreligions, one Jew, sixteen Catholics, twenty-four Moslems, and\r\nthirty-one Orthodox.  The Government has reserved for itself the right\r\nof naming twenty members!  The constitution provides for individual\r\nliberty, the inviolability of one's home, liberty of the press and\r\nspeech, and secrecy of letters and telegrams.  This enlightened measure\r\nof the Emperor was heralded to the world.  But of course there was the\r\njoker, Article 20.  Vienna held the highest card!  In case of menace to\r\nthe public safety, all public and private rights may be suspended by a\r\nword from Vienna.  Public safety always being menaced in Bosnia, the\r\nconstitution is perpetually suspended.  The Government even goes as far\r\nas to prosecute deputies for their speeches in Parliament.  Newspapers\r\nare continually censored.  Their telegraphic news from Vienna and\r\nBuda-Pesth is suppressed without reason.  Particularly severe {155}\r\nfines--sometimes jail sentences--are passed upon offending journalists.\r\n\r\nIs it necessarily because of instigation and propaganda from Belgrade\r\nthat of the three Servian political parties in Bosnia two (the _Narod_\r\nand the _Otachbina_) are closely allied to the Pan-Servian Society\r\n_Narodna Obrana_, and that these two parties openly support the\r\nseparatist movement?\r\n\r\nIn Bosnia, Dalmatia, and Croatia in 1914 the bureaucracy of Vienna has\r\nbeen engaged in the same process of repression and police persecution\r\nas in Italy during the half century from 1815 to the liberation of\r\nItaly.  The local constitutions have been suspended everywhere.  Why\r\nhave the Austrians, in spite of the lessons of the beginning of the\r\npresent reign, dared to tempt providence in exactly the same way after\r\nthe Golden Jubilee?\r\n\r\nThe victories of the Allies in the Balkans were a terrible blow to\r\nAustria-Hungary.  Not only was her dream of reaching the Ægean Sea\r\nthrough the _sandjak_ of Novi Bazar and Macedonia shattered by the\r\nGreek occupation of Salonika, but the aggrandizement of Servia, caused\r\nby a successful war, threatened to have a serious effect upon the\r\nfortunes of the Empire.  The appearance of the Servians on the Adriatic\r\nwould mean really the extension of Russian influence through Bulgaria\r\nand Servia to the Austrian and Italian private lake, and would cut off\r\nAustria for ever from her economic outlet to the Ægean.  But there\r\n{156} was more than this to cause alarm both in Austria and in Hungary.\r\nBosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, and Dalmatia--would they remain loyal to\r\nthe Empire, if once they came under the spell of the idea of Greater\r\nServia?  Leaving Russia entirely out of the calculation, an\r\nindependent, self-reliant, and enlarged Servia, extending towards the\r\nAdriatic and Ægean Seas, if not actually reaching it,--would it not be,\r\nas Professor Wirth declared, \"the suicide of Germany\"?  The statesmen\r\nof the Hohenzollern and Hapsburg Empires determined that it should not\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nFrom the very moment that the Servian armies drove the Turks before\r\nthem, Austria-Hungary began to act the bully against Servia.  The\r\nAustrian consuls at Prisrend and Mitrovitza were made the first cause\r\nof Austrian interference.  It was pretended that Herr Prochaska had\r\nbeen massacred and mutilated at Prisrend, and that the life of Herr\r\nTáhy had been threatened so that he was forced to flee for safety from\r\nMitrovitza.  A formal inquest showed that the first of these consuls\r\nwas safe, and that the trouble had been merely a discussion between\r\nServian officers and Herr Prochaska over some fleeing Albanians who had\r\ntaken refuge in the consulate, in the other case, there seemed to be no\r\nground at all for complaint.  But on January 15, 1913, the Servians\r\nacceded to the demand of Austria that the reparation be granted for the\r\nPrisrend incident.  A company of Servian soldiers saluted the\r\nAustro-Hungarian flag as Consul Prochaska {157} solemnly raised it.\r\nThis incident seems too petty to mention, but in that part of the world\r\nand at that moment we thought it very serious.  For it showed how\r\nanxious Austria-Hungary was to pick a quarrel with Servia in the midst\r\nof the Balkan War.\r\n\r\nTwo other incidents of an even more serious character immediately\r\nfollowed.  Servia refused the Austrian demand that Durazzo be\r\nevacuated, supporting herself upon the hope that Russia would\r\nintervene.  During December and January, deluded by unofficial\r\nrepresentatives of Russian public sentiment and by demonstrations\r\nagainst Austria-Hungary in Moscow and Petrograd, Servia held out.  It\r\nwas only when she saw that Russian support was not forthcoming that she\r\nwithdrew from Durazzo.  The international situation during January,\r\n1913, was similar to that during July, 1914, and the cause of the\r\ncrisis was practically the same.  In both cases Servia backed down, but\r\nthe second time Austria-Hungary and Germany determined to provoke the\r\nwar which they believed would be the end of Servia and the destruction\r\nof Russia's power to influence the political evolution of Balkan\r\nPeninsula.\r\n\r\nAfter Durazzo, it was Scutari.  Servia for the third time bowed before\r\nthe will of Austria.\r\n\r\nThe next move against Servia was the annexation on May 12, 1913, of the\r\nlittle island of Ada-Kaleh on the Danube, which had curiously enough\r\nremained Turkish property after the Treaty of Berlin.  It had actually\r\nbeen forgotten at that time.  {158} This island, situated in front of\r\nOrsova, would have given Servia a splendid strategic position at the\r\nmouth of the river.  Austria-Hungary anticipated the Treaty of London.\r\n\r\nIt was to reduce Servia that secret encouragement was given to Bulgaria\r\nto provoke the second Balkan war.  There is no doubt now as to the rôle\r\nof the Austro-Hungarian Minister at Sofia in allowing this crisis to be\r\nprecipitated.\r\n\r\nHad Germany been willing to stand behind her at Bukarest,\r\nAustria-Hungary would have prevented the signing of the treaty between\r\nthe Balkan States by presenting an ultimatum to Servia.  But Germany\r\ndid not seem to be ready.  The reason commonly given that Emperor\r\nWilliam did not want to embarrass King Carol of Rumania, a prince of\r\nhis own house, and his brother-in-law, the King of Greece, does not\r\nseem credible.  In view of the events that have happened since, the\r\nsigning of the Treaty of Bukarest is a mystery not yet cleared up.\r\n\r\nThe second Balkan war acted as a boomerang to Austria-Hungary.  It\r\nincreased tremendously the prestige of Servia abroad, and the\r\nconfidence of the Servians in themselves.  The weakness of the Turkish\r\narmies in the first Balkan war had been so great that Servia herself\r\nhardly considered it a fair test of her military strength.  To have\r\nmeasured arms successfully with Bulgaria was worth as much to Servia as\r\nthe territory that she gained.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how strained were the relationships of Austria-Hungary as\r\nseparate kingdoms and {159} together as an empire in their relationship\r\nwith their south Slavic subjects.  The Croatians, the Dalmatians, and a\r\nmajor portion of the inhabitants of Bosnia-Herzegovina were Servian in\r\nlanguage and sympathies.  They had never thought of political union\r\nwith Servia, the petty kingdom which had allowed its rulers to be\r\nassassinated, and which seemed to be insignificant in comparison with\r\nthe powerful and brilliant country of which they would not have been\r\nunwilling, if allowed real self-government, to remain a part.  But a\r\nlarge and glorified Servia, with an increased territory and a\r\nwell-earned and brilliant military reputation--would this prove an\r\nattraction to win away the dissatisfied subjects of the Dual Monarchy?\r\n\r\nAustria-Hungary by the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina had taken to\r\nherself more Servians in a compact mass than she could well assimilate.\r\nThey were not scattered and separated geographically like her other\r\nSlavic subjects.  It was a danger from the beginning.  After the Balkan\r\nwars, it became an imminent peril.\r\n\r\nThe death sentence of Servia was decided by the statesmen of\r\nAustria-Hungary and Germany the moment their newspapers brought to them\r\nthe story of the battle of Kumonova.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget my presentiment when I heard on June 29, 1914,\r\ndown in a little Breton village, that a Bosnian student had celebrated\r\nthe anniversary of the battle of Kossova by assassinating the Archduke\r\nFranz Ferdinand.  The incident for which Austria was waiting had\r\nhappened.  There {160} came back to me the words of Hakki Pasha, \"If\r\nItaly declares war on Turkey, the cannon will not cease to speak until\r\nall Europe is in conflagration.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--As a commentary on Austrian rule in Bosnia, particularly in\r\nconnection with the statistics on pages 152-153 of this chapter,\r\nconsider von Kállay who, as Governor of Bosnia-Herzegovina, fought so\r\nbitterly the rise of national feeling among the Servians through the\r\nteaching in their schools.  This same von Kállay, in his earlier days,\r\nwrote a scholarly history of Servia, which I have had occasion to use.\r\nIt is admirably written and accurate in detail.  As a research scholar,\r\nvon Kállay believed that Bosnians, Serbs, and Croats were _the same\r\nrace_, and supported this thesis; but, as an Austrian official, he\r\ndisclaimed such dangerous teaching by placing the ban upon his own\r\nbook, which he forbade to be introduced into the provinces of which he\r\nwas governor!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{161}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nRACIAL RIVALRIES IN MACEDONIA\r\n\r\nIn the latter half of the nineteenth century, the peace of Europe was\r\ntwice disturbed, and terrible wars occurred, over the question of the\r\nintegrity of the Ottoman Empire.  Since it is still the same question\r\nwhich has had most to do--directly at least--with bringing on the\r\ngeneral European war of 1914, it is important to consider what has\r\nbeen, since the Treaty of Berlin, the very heart of the Eastern\r\nquestion in relation to Europe, the rivalry of races in Macedonia.\r\n\r\nWhen the European Powers, following the lead of Great Britain,\r\nintervened after the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 to annul the Treaty\r\nof San Stefano, they frustrated the emancipation from Moslem rule of\r\nthe Christian populations in Macedonia.  A Balkan territorial and\r\npolitical _status quo_ was decided upon by a Congress of the Powers at\r\nBerlin in 1878.  In receiving back Macedonia, Turkey solemnly promised\r\nto give equal rights to her Christian subjects.  In taking upon\r\nthemselves the terrible responsibility of restoring Christians to\r\nTurkish rule, the Powers assumed at the same time the obligation to\r\nwatch Turkey and _compel her to keep her promises_.\r\n\r\n{162}\r\n\r\nThe delegates of the Powers brought to the Congress of Berlin a\r\ndetermination to solve the problems of South-eastern Europe, according\r\nto what they believed to be the personal selfish interests of the\r\nnations they represented.  From the beginning of the Congress to the\r\nend, there was never a single thought of serving the interests of the\r\npeople whose destinies they were presuming to decide.  They compromised\r\nwith each other \"to preserve the peace of Europe.\"  This formula has\r\nalways been interpreted in diplomacy as the getting of all you can for\r\nyour country without having to fight for it!\r\n\r\nPractically every provision of the Treaty of Berlin has been\r\ndisregarded by the contracting parties and by the Balkan States.  The\r\npolicy of Turkey in this respect has not been different from that of\r\nthe Christian Powers.  Great Britain and France, as their colonial\r\nempires increased, ignored the obligations of the treaty which they had\r\nsigned, because they feared the effect upon their commercial and\r\ncolonial interests overseas, were they to press the Khalif.  The only\r\neffective pressure would have been force of arms.  When popular\r\nsympathy was stirred to the depths by the cruelty of Abdul Hamid's\r\noppression and massacres, successive British and French Cabinets washed\r\ntheir hands of any responsibility towards the Christians in Turkey.\r\nPan-Islamism was their nightmare.  They had an overwhelming fear of\r\narousing Mohammedan sentiment against them in their colonies.  Germany\r\nrefused to hold Abdul Hamid to his promises, because she wanted to\r\ncurry favour with him to get a foothold in Asiatic Turkey.  {163}\r\nRussia and Austria, the Powers most vitally interested in the Ottoman\r\nEmpire, because they were its neighbours, were agreed upon preserving\r\nthe Sultan's domination in the Balkan Peninsula, no matter how great\r\nthe oppression of Christians became.  Neither Power wanted to see the\r\nother increase in influence among the Balkan nationalities.\r\n\r\nThe centres of intrigue were Bulgaria, Albania, Thrace, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, and Macedonia, the portions of the Peninsula which had\r\nbeen refused emancipation by the Congress of Berlin.  Bulgaria worked\r\nout her own emancipation.  She refused the tutelage of Russia, annexed\r\nEastern Rumelia in defiance of the Powers in 1885, and proclaimed her\r\nindependence in 1908.  The fortunes of Albania have been followed in\r\nanother chapter.  Thrace was too near Constantinople, the forbidden\r\ncity, too unimportant economically, and too largely Moslem in\r\npopulation to be coveted by the Balkan States.  Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nadministered by Austria-Hungary since 1878, were annexed in defiance of\r\ntreaty obligations in 1908.  The principal victim of the mischief done\r\nby the Congress of Berlin was Macedonia.\r\n\r\nThe future of Macedonia has been the great source of conflict between\r\nAustria-Hungary and Russia, and between the Balkan States.  At Athens,\r\nSofia, Belgrade, Bukarest, and Cettinje, the diplomats of Russia,\r\nAustria-Hungary, and Turkey, from the morrow of the Berlin Congress to\r\nthe eve of the recent Balkan Wars, played a game against each other,\r\nendeavouring always to use the Balkan States {164} as pawns in their\r\nsordid strife.  Turkey was backed by France and England, whenever it\r\nsuited opportune diplomacy to do so.  Austria-Hungary was backed by\r\nGermany, who at the same time did not hesitate to play a hand with the\r\nTurks.  Russia has always stood more or less alone in the Balkan\r\nquestion, even after the conclusion of the alliance with France.\r\nExcept at Cettinje, Italian activity in this diplomatic game has never\r\nbeen particularly marked.\r\n\r\nWhat has been the object of the game?  This is difficult to state\r\ncategorically.  Aims have changed with changing conditions.  For\r\nexample, during the five years immediately following the Congress of\r\nBerlin, British diplomacy was directed strenuously towards keeping down\r\nemancipated Bulgaria, and towards preventing the encroachment of Servia\r\nin the direction of the Adriatic and the Ægean.  But when she saw that\r\nBulgaria had refused to be the tool of Russia, and when her problem of\r\nthe trade route of India had been solved by the buying up of the\r\nmajority of shares in the Suez Canal and the occupation of Egypt, Great\r\nBritain championed Bulgaria and sustained her in the annexation of\r\nEastern Rumelia.  British policy remained anti-Servian for thirty\r\nyears.  There was more in the withdrawal of the British Legation from\r\nBelgrade than disapproval of a dastardly regicide.  But the moment\r\nBritish commerce began to fear German competition, and an accord had\r\nbeen made with Russia to remove causes of conflict, the British press\r\nbegan to change its tone towards Servia.  What a miracle has been\r\nwrought in the decade since \"an {165} immoral race of blackguards, with\r\nno sense of national honour\" has become \"that brave and noble little\r\nrace, spirited defenders of the liberties of Europe!\"  I quote these\r\ntwo sentiments from the same newspapers.  If Premier Asquith is sincere\r\nin his belief that this present war is to defend the principle of the\r\nsanctity of treaties, will he insist, when peace is concluded, that\r\nServia make good her oath to Bulgaria, and Russia her international\r\ntreaty obligations in regard to the kingdom of Poland?  Great Britain\r\nis the least of the offenders when it comes to diplomatic cant and\r\nhypocrisy.  For the British electorate has a keen sense of justice, and\r\nan intelligent determination that British influence shall be exerted\r\nfor the betterment of humanity.  Cabinets must reckon with this\r\nelectorate when they decide questions of foreign policy.\r\n\r\nBut we do not want to lose ourselves in a maze of diplomatic intrigue,\r\nwhich it is fruitless to follow, even if we could.  We must limit\r\nourselves to an exposition of the ambitions of Austria-Hungary and of\r\nthe Balkan States to the possession of this coveted province.\r\n\r\nSince the creation of modern Italy, the great German trade route to the\r\nMediterranean has been changed.  The influence in Teutonic commercial\r\nevolution of the passing of Lombardy and Venetia from the political\r\ntutelage of a thousand years has been of tremendous importance, for the\r\nconnection between Germany and Italy had always been vital.  It was the\r\nfirst Napoleon who broke this connection.  It was the third Napoleon\r\nwho nullified the effort {166} of the Congress of Vienna to\r\nre-establish it.  United Italy gave a new direction to Teutonic\r\nexpansion.  United Germany gave to it a new impulsion.  The _Drang nach\r\nOsten_ was born.\r\n\r\nBy the Convention of Reichstadt in 1876, Austria-Hungary secured from\r\nRussia the promise of the Turkish provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nin return for her neutrality in the \"approaching war of liberation\" of\r\nRussia against Turkey.  In order to liberate some Slavs, Russia changed\r\nthe subjection of others.  The Convention of Reichstadt is really the\r\nstarting-point of the quarrel which has grown so bitterly during the\r\nlast generation between Austria and Russia over the Slavs of the Balkan\r\nPeninsula.  Russia paid dearly for a \"free hand\" with Turkey in 1877.\r\nShe is paying still.\r\n\r\nIn her attitude towards the Balkans, Austria has had three distinct\r\naims: the prevention of a Slavic outlet to the Adriatic, the\r\nrealization of a German outlet to the Ægean, and the effectual\r\nhindrance of the growth in the Balkans of a strong independent south\r\nSlavic state, which might prove a fatal attraction to her own provinces\r\nof Croatia and Dalmatia.  It was this triple consideration that led her\r\nto the occupation and annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to the\r\npolicy of hostility to Servia, which is developed in another chapter.\r\nDesiring to possess for herself the wonderful port of Salonika on the\r\nÆgean bea, to reach which her railroads would have to cross Macedonia,\r\nthe policy of Austria-Hungary towards Macedonia has been consistently\r\nto endeavour to uphold the semblance of Turkish {167} authority, and at\r\nthe same time to make that authority difficult to uphold through the\r\nexciting of racial rivalry among Greece, Servia, Bulgaria, Rumania, and\r\nAlbania, in this turbulent country.  Turkey and Austria met on the\r\ncommon ground of \"keeping the pot boiling,\" although with a different\r\naim.  By keeping the pot boiling, Turkey thought that her sovereignty\r\nwas safe, while Austria hoped that when Turkey and the Balkan States\r\nhad worn themselves out, each opposing the other, she could step in and\r\ncapture the prize.\r\n\r\nTurkey and Austria-Hungary, then, conspired together to create as many\r\npoints of conflict as possible among the Macedonians of different\r\nraces.  The most devilish ingenuity was constantly exercised in\r\nstirring up and keeping alive the hatred of each race over the other.\r\nWhile frequently aroused to the point of making perfunctory protests,\r\nthe other nations of Europe, with the exception of Russia, let Austria\r\nand Turkey do as they pleased, just as Turkey was allowed a free hand\r\nin massacring the Armenians.  The _laissez faire_ policy of the Powers\r\nwas a denial of their treaty obligations.\r\n\r\nIt was only when the Balkan States awoke to the realization of the fact\r\nthat they were regarded as mere pawns upon the chessboard of world\r\npolitics, to be sacrificed without compunction by the European Powers\r\nwhenever it was to their interest, that they buried differences for a\r\nmoment, and worked out their own salvation.  If the Balkan Wars have\r\nbrought the present terrible disaster upon Europe, it is no more than\r\nthe contemptible {168} diplomacy of self interest and mutual jealousy\r\ncould expect.\r\n\r\nWhy was the Austro-Turkish policy possible, and why did it succeed for\r\na whole generation?\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Empire was founded in the Balkan peninsula by rulers whose\r\nmilitary genius was coupled with their ability to use one Christian\r\npopulation against the other.  The Osmanlis never fought a battle in\r\nwhich the Balkan Christians did not give valuable assistance in forging\r\nthe chains of their slavery.  The Osmanlis conquered the Balkan peoples\r\nby means of the Balkan peoples.  They kept possession of the country\r\njust as long as they could pit one chief against another, and then,\r\nwhen national feeling arose, one race against another.\r\n\r\nGradually, in the portion of the Balkans where one race was\r\npredominant, nationalities began to form states, which secured\r\nindependence as soon as they demonstrated the possibility of harmony.\r\nGreece was the first, and was followed by Servia.  Moldavia and\r\nWallachia united into the principality of Rumania.  Last of all came\r\nBulgaria.  After having gained autonomy, independence was only a matter\r\nof form.  But in the central portion of the Balkan Peninsula, from the\r\nBlack Sea to the Ægean, through Thrace, Macedonia, and Albania, the\r\nsovereignty of Turkey, restored by the Treaty of Berlin, was able to\r\nendure.  For the people were mixed up, race living with race, and in no\r\nplace could the Christians of any one race claim that the country was\r\nwholly theirs.\r\n\r\nAs emancipated Greeks, Servians and Bulgarians {169} formed independent\r\nstates, they looked towards Macedonia as the legitimate territory for\r\nexpansion.  But here their claims, both historically and racially,\r\noverlapped.  Greece regarded Macedonia as entirely Hellenic.  Had it\r\nnot always been Greek before the Osmanlis came, from the days of Philip\r\nof Macedon to the Paleologi of the Byzantine Empire?  The Servians, on\r\nthe other hand, invoked the memory of the Servian Empire of Stephen\r\nDushan, who in the fourteenth century, on the eve of the Ottoman\r\nconquest, was crowned \"King of Romania\" at Serres.  It was from the\r\nServians and not from the Greeks, that the Osmanlis conquered Macedonia\r\nin the three battles of the Maritza, Tchernomen, and Kossova.  The\r\nBulgarians invoked the memory of their mediæval domination of Macedonia\r\nand Thrace.  It was by the Bulgarians that northern Thrace was defended\r\nagainst the Ottoman invasion; a Bulgarian prince was the last\r\nindependent ruler of central Macedonia; and long before the ephemeral\r\nServian Empire of Stephen Dushan, the Bulgarian Czars were recognized\r\nfrom Tirnova to Okrida.  This latter city, in fact, was the seat of the\r\nautonomous Bulgarian patriarchate in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nThese historical claims, to us of western Europe, would have only a\r\nsentimental value.  They had been forgotten by the subject populations\r\nof European Turkey for many centuries.  The first revival of political\r\nambitions was that of Hellenism.  Modern Greece, divorcing itself from\r\nthe impossible and pagan dream of a restoration of classic Greece, with\r\nAthens as its capital, which had been woven for it {170} by western\r\nEuropean admirers during the first half century of its liberation,\r\nbegan to take stock of its Byzantine and Christian heritage during the\r\nlatter part of the reign of Abdul Aziz.  The new Hellenism, as the\r\nprestige of the Ottoman Empire decreased, took the definite form of a\r\ndetermination to succeed the Ottoman Empire, as it had preceded it,\r\nwith Constantinople as capital.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks believed themselves to be the unifying Christian race of the\r\nBalkan Peninsula.  They had a tremendous advantage over the Slavs,\r\nbecause the ecclesiastical organization, to which all the Christians of\r\nthe Balkan Peninsula owed allegiance, was in their hands.  When\r\nMohammed the Conqueror entered Constantinople, he gave to the Patriarch\r\nof the Eastern Church the headship of the Balkan Christians.  The\r\nspirit of Moslem institutions provides for no other form of government\r\nthan a theocracy.  Religion has always been to the Osmanli the test of\r\nnationality.  The Christians formed one _millet_, or nation.  This\r\n_millet_ was Greek.  During all the centuries of Ottoman subjection,\r\nthe Balkan Christians owed allegiance to the Greek Patriarchate.\r\nWhatever their native tongue, the language of the Church and _of the\r\nschools_ was Greek.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Hellenism, the new Greek aspirations came into\r\nimmediate conflict with the renaissance of the Bulgarian nation.\r\nRussia had long been encouraging, for the purposes of Pan-Slavism, the\r\nawakening of a sense of nationality in the south Slavs.  Her agents had\r\nbeen long and patiently working among the Bulgarians.  But they {171}\r\novershot their mark.  When Bulgarian priests and the few educated men\r\nof the peasant nation turned their attention to their past and their\r\nlanguage, it was not the idea of their kinship with the great Slavic\r\nPower of eastern Europe that was aroused, _but the consciousness of\r\ntheir own particular race_.  Bulgaria had been great when Russia was\r\npractically unknown.  Bulgaria could be great once more, when, by the\r\ndisappearance of Ottoman rule, the Bulgarian Empire of the Middle Ages\r\nwould be born again in the Balkans.\r\n\r\nOne can readily appreciate that _the first necessity of Bulgarian\r\nrenaissance was liberation from the Greek Church_.  Russia strenuously\r\nopposed this separatist agitation.  What she wanted was a Slavic\r\nmovement within the bosom of the Greek Orthodox Church, which, if\r\nbitterly persecuted by the Patriarchate, would throw the south Slavs\r\nupon the Russian Synod for protection, or, if tolerated, would give\r\nRussia a powerful voice in the councils of the Orthodox Church in the\r\nOttoman Empire.  But the Bulgarians had progressed too far on the road\r\nof religious separation from the Greeks to be arrested by their Russian\r\ngodfather.  It was a prophecy of the future independent spirit of the\r\nBulgarian people, which Beaconsfield and Salisbury unfortunately failed\r\nto note, that the Bulgarians determined to go the length of uniting\r\nwith Rome in order to get free from Phanar.  Another Uniate sect would\r\nhave been born had Russia not yielded.  With bad grace, her Ambassador\r\nobtained from Sultan Abdul Aziz the _firman_ of March 11, 1870,\r\ncreating the Bulgarian Exarchate.\r\n\r\n{172}\r\n\r\nThe cleverness of the Bulgarians outwitted the manoeuvre made to have\r\nthe seat of the Exarchate at Sofia.  The Greeks realized that a\r\nformidable competitor had entered into the struggle for Macedonia.\r\nFrom that moment there has been hatred between Greek and Bulgarian.  In\r\nspite of the treaty of Bukarest, the end of the struggle is not yet.\r\nThe policy and ambition of the modern state are dictated by strong\r\neconomic reasons, of which sentimental aspirations are only the outward\r\nexpression.  If wars and the treaties that follow them were guided by\r\nhonest confession of the real issues at stake, how much easier the\r\nsolution of problems, and how much greater the chances of finding\r\ndurable bases for treaties!  The whole effort of Bulgaria in Macedonia\r\nmay be explained by the simple statement that the Bulgarian race has\r\nbeen seeking its natural, logical, and inevitable outlet to the Ægean\r\nSea.\r\n\r\nDuring the middle of the nineteenth century, Servian national\r\naspirations were directed toward Croatia, Dalmatia, and\r\nBosnia-Herzegovina.  The Servians thought only in terms of the west.\r\nIt was the foundation of the Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy in 1867,\r\nfollowed by the Austrian occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and of the\r\n_sandjak_ of Novi Bazar, that let Servia to enter into the struggle for\r\nMacedonia.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Russia saw that she could not control Bulgaria, she began to\r\nfavour a Servian propaganda in the valley of the Vardar.  Russian\r\nintrigues at Constantinople led to the suppression of the Bulgarian\r\nbishoprics of Okrida, Uskub, Küprülü (Veles) {173} and Nevrokop.\r\nBulgaria secured the restoration of these bishoprics through the\r\nefforts of Austria-Hungary and Great Britain.  The story of Macedonia\r\nis full of instances like this of intrigue and counter intrigue by\r\nEuropean Powers at the Sublime Porte.  Combinations of interests\r\nchanged sometimes over night.  Is it any wonder that the Turks grew to\r\ndespise the European alliances, and to laugh at every \"joint note\" of\r\nthe Powers in relation to Macedonia?\r\n\r\nAustria-Hungary opposed the Russian aid given to Servia by introducing\r\na new racial propaganda.  Ever since the Roman occupation there had\r\nbeen a small, but widely diffused, element in the population of\r\nMacedonia, which retained the Roman language, just as the Wallachians\r\nand Moldavians north of the Danube had done.  Diplomatic suggestion at\r\nBukarest succeeded in interesting Rumania in these Kutzo-Wallachians,\r\nas they came to be called.  Rumania did not have a common boundary with\r\nEuropean Turkey.  But her statesmen were quick to see the advantage of\r\nhaving \"a finger in the pie\" when the Ottoman Empire disappeared from\r\nEurope.  So Rumania became protector of the Kutzo-Wallachian.  The\r\nSublime Porte gladly agreed to recognize this protectorate.  The\r\ndevelopment of a strong Rumanian element in Macedonia would help\r\ngreatly to preserve Turkish sovereignty.  For Rumania could have no\r\nterritorial aspirations there, and would look with disfavour upon\r\nRumania being swallowed up by Greece, Servia, or Bulgaria.  Another\r\npropaganda, well financed, and encouraged {174} by the Austro-Hungarian\r\nand Turkish Governments was added to the rivalry of races in Macedonia.\r\n\r\nWe cannot do more than suggest these intrigues.  After 1885, the\r\nMacedonian question became gradually the peculiar care of the two \"most\r\ninterested\" Powers.  There was little to attract again international\r\nattention until the question of Turkey's existence as a state was\r\nbrought forward in a most startling way by the repercussion throughout\r\nthe Empire of the Armenian massacres of 1893-96.  _By refusing to\r\nintervene at that time, the Powers, who fondly thought that they were\r\nacting in the interest of the integrity of the Empire, were really\r\ncontributing to its further decline_.\r\n\r\nElsewhere we have spoken of the Cretan insurrection of 1896 and the\r\ntrain of events that followed it, ending in the formation of the Balkan\r\nalliance to drive Turkey out of Europe.  Here we take up the other\r\nthread which leads us to the Balkan Wars.  Bulgaria, remembering the\r\nhappy result of her own sufferings from the massacres of twenty years\r\nbefore, was keen enough to see in the Asiatic holocausts of the \"Red\r\nSultan\" a sign of weakness instead of a show of strength.  The\r\nstatesmen of the European Powers had not acted to stop the massacres of\r\nthe Armenians.  But their indecision and impolitic irresolution was not\r\nan expression of the sentiments of the civilized races whom they\r\nrepresented.  The time was ripe for an insurrection in Macedonia.\r\nPublic opinion in Europe would sustain it.  The movement was launched\r\nfrom Sofia.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment, Turkish sovereignty was {175} doomed.  Turkey did not\r\nrealize this, however.  Instead of adopting the policy of treating with\r\nBulgaria, and giving her an economic outlet to the Ægean Sea, the\r\nSublime Porte was delighted with the anticipation of a new era of\r\nracial rivalry in Macedonia.  For it knew that Bulgaria's efforts to\r\nsecure Macedonian autonomy would be opposed by Servia and Greece.  In\r\nfact, the Greeks were so alarmed by the Bulgarian activity that\r\nimmediately after their unhappy war with Turkey they gave active\r\nsupport to the Turks in putting down the Bulgarian rebels.  The\r\nservices of the Greek Patriarchate were particularly valuable to Turkey\r\nat this time.\r\n\r\nNor did Austria-Hungary and Russia appreciate the significance of the\r\nBulgarian movement.  In 1897, they signed an accord, solemnly agreeing\r\nthat the _status quo_ be preserved in the Balkan peninsula.  Russia was\r\nanxious for this convention with Austria.  For the moment all her\r\nenergies were devoted to developing the policy in the Far East that was\r\nto end so abruptly eight years later on the battlefield of Mukden.\r\nAustria-Hungary was delighted to have the solution of the Macedonian\r\nproblem delayed.  _She felt that every year of anarchy in European\r\nTurkey would bring her nearer to Salonika_.  The _Drang nach Osten_ was\r\nto be made possible through the strife of Servian, Bulgarian, and Greek.\r\n\r\nThe moment was favourable for the Bulgarian propaganda.  Russia was too\r\nmuch involved in Manchuria to help the Servians.  The Greeks had lost\r\nprestige with the Macedonians by their easy {176} and humiliating\r\ndefeat at the hands of Turkey.  Gathering force with successive years,\r\nand supported by the admirably laid foundation of the Bulgarian\r\necclesiastic and scholastic organizations throughout Macedonia, the\r\nBulgarian bands gradually brought the _vilayets_ of Monastir, Uskub,\r\nand Salonika into a state of civil war.  In 1901 and 1902, conditions\r\nin Macedonia were beyond description.  But the Powers waited for some\r\nnew initiative on the part of Austria-Hungary and Russia.\r\n\r\nEmperor Franz Josef and Czar Nicholas met at Mürszteg in the autumn of\r\n1903.  Russia, more and more involved in Manchuria, and on the eve of\r\nher conflict with Japan, found no difficulty in falling in with the\r\nsuggestion of the Austrian Foreign Secretary that the two Powers\r\npresent to the signers of the Treaty of Berlin a program of \"reforms\"\r\nfor Macedonia.  Europe received with delight this new manifestation of\r\nharmony between Austria-Hungary and Russia.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 the \"Program of Mürszteg\" was imposed upon Turkey by a\r\ncomic-opera show of force on the part of the Powers.  An international\r\n_gendarmerie_ was their solution of the Macedonian problem.  Different\r\nspheres were mapped out, and allotted to officers of the different\r\nPowers.  Germany refused to participate in this farce, just as she had\r\nrefused to participate in \"protecting\" Crete.\r\n\r\nThe international \"pacification\" failed in Macedonia for the same\r\nreasons that it had failed in Crete, and was to fail a third time ten\r\nyears later in Albania.  _It was a compromise between the Powers, {177}\r\ndictated by considerations which had nothing whatever to do with the\r\nproblem of which it was supposed to be the solution_.  This is the\r\nstory of European diplomacy in the Near East.\r\n\r\nFrom the very moment that Turkey found herself compelled to accept the\r\npolicing of Macedonia by European officers, she set to work to make\r\ntheir task impossible.  Hussein Hilmi pasha was sent to Salonika as\r\nGovernor.  An accord was quickly established between him and the\r\nAustro-Hungarian agents in Macedonia.  Where the Bulgarians were weak,\r\nthe Turks and the Austrian emissaries encouraged the Bulgarian\r\npropaganda.  Where the Greeks were weak, Hellenic bands were allowed\r\nimmunity.  Where the Servians were weak, the connivance of the\r\nGovernment.  The European _gendarmerie_ was powerless to struggle\r\nagainst Turkish, Austro-Hungarian, and Balkan intrigues.  The\r\ncorrespondence of the European officers and consuls, and of journalists\r\nwho visited Macedonia during this period, makes interesting reading.\r\nTheir point of view is almost invariably that of their surroundings.\r\nIt depended upon just what part of Macedonia one happened to be in, or\r\nthe company in which one travelled, whether a certain nationality were\r\n\"noble heroes suffering for an ideal\" or \"blood-thirsty ruffians.\"  Why\r\nare so many writers who pretend to be impartial observers like\r\nchameleons?\r\n\r\nGreece, Servia, and Bulgaria were alike guilty of subsidizing bands of\r\narmed men, who imagined that they were fulfilling a patriotic duty in\r\nbrutally {178} forcing their particular nationality upon ignorant\r\npeasants, most of whom did not know--or care--to what nation they\r\nbelonged.  There was little to choose between the methods and the\r\nactions of the different bands.  Everywhere pillage, incendiarism, and\r\nassassination were the order of the day.  When Christian propagandists\r\nlet them alone, the poor villagers had to endure the same treatment\r\nfrom Moslem Albanians and from the Turkish soldiery.\r\n\r\nIn order to give the \"reforms\" of the Program of Mürszteg a chance,\r\nAthens, Sofia, and Belgrade ostensibly withdrew their active support of\r\nthe bands.  But the efforts of the Powers had still not only the secret\r\nbad faith of Austria-Hungary and Turkey to contend with, but also the\r\ndetermination of the Macedonians themselves not to be \"reformed\" _à\r\nl'européenne_, that is to say, _à la turque_.  The powerful Bulgarian\r\n\"interior organization\" in Macedonia kept up the struggle in the hope\r\nthat the continuation of anarchy would bring the Powers to see that\r\nthere was no other solution possible of the Macedonian question _than\r\nthe autonomy of Macedonia under a Christian governor_.  Greeks and\r\nServians opposed the project of autonomy, however, because they knew\r\nthat it would result eventually in the reversion of Macedonia to\r\nBulgaria.  The history of Eastern Rumelia would be repeated.  In\r\nconsidering the Macedonian problem, it must never be forgotten that the\r\ngreat bulk of the population of Macedonia is Bulgarian, in spite of all\r\nthe learned dissertations and imposing statistics of Greek and Servian\r\nwriters.  But the difficulty is that this {179} Bulgarian population is\r\nagricultural.  In the cities _near the sea_ and all along the seacoast\r\nfrom Salonika to Dedeagatch the Greek element is predominant.  No\r\ngeographical division of Macedonia can be made, viable from the\r\neconomic point of view, which satisfies racial claims by following the\r\nprinciple of preponderant nationality.\r\n\r\nAfter her disasters in the Far East, Russia began to turn her attention\r\nonce more to the Near East.  A reopening of the Macedonian question\r\nbetween Austria-Hungary and Russia was imminent when the Young Turk\r\nrevolution of July, 1908, upset all calculations, and brought a new\r\nfactor into the problem of the future of European Turkey.\r\nAustria-Hungary boldly challenged--more than that, defied--Russia by\r\nannexing Bosnia-Herzegovina.  In this action she was backed by Germany.\r\nRussia and France were not ready for war.  Great Britain and Italy,\r\neach involved in an internal social revolution of tremendous\r\nimportance, could not afford to risk the programs of their respective\r\ncabinets by embarking upon uncertain foreign adventures.\r\n\r\nThe Balkan States were left to solve the Macedonian problem by\r\nthemselves.  Their solution was the Treaty of Bukarest.  The success of\r\nServia in planting herself in the valley of the Vardar, and in\r\noccupying Monastir, is the result of the struggle of races in\r\nMacedonia.  It is the direct, immediate cause of the European War of\r\n1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{180}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG TURK _RÉGIME_ IN THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE\r\n\r\nNo event during the first decade of the twentieth century was heralded\r\nthroughout Europe with so great and so sincere interest and sympathy as\r\nthe bloodless revolution of July 24, 1908, by which the _régime_ of\r\nAbdul Hamid was overthrown and the constitution of 1876 resuscitated.\r\n\r\nAlthough the world was unprepared for this event, it was not due to any\r\nsudden cause.  For twenty years the leaven of liberalism had been\r\nworking in the minds of the educated classes in the Ottoman Empire.\r\nMoslems, as well as Christians, had been in attendance in large numbers\r\nat the American, French, Italian, and German schools in Turkey, and had\r\ngone abroad to complete their education.  Just as in Italy and in\r\nGermany, Young Turkey had come into existence through contact with\r\nthose free institutions in the outside world which other races enjoyed,\r\nhad been emancipated from superstition and from the stultifying\r\ninfluences of religious formalism, and had grown, in the army, to\r\nnumbers sufficient to dictate the policy of the Government.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Abdul Hamid had {181} done all in his\r\npower to prevent the growth of the liberal spirit.  The result of\r\nthirty years, in so far as civil officials of the Government were\r\nconcerned, had been the stamping out of every man who combined ability\r\nwith patriotism and devotion to an ideal.  The best elements had taken\r\nthe road to death, to imprisonment, or to exile, so that from the\r\npalace down to the humblest village, the Turkish civil service was\r\ncomposed of a set of men absolutely lacking in independence and in\r\nhonour, and devoted to the master who ruled from Yildiz.  But in the\r\narmy, this same policy, though attempted, had not wholly succeeded.  A\r\nportion at least of the officers received an education; many of them,\r\nindeed, had been sent abroad to Germany and to France in order to keep\r\nabreast with the development of military science, so essential to the\r\nvery existence of Turkey.  In the army, then, hundreds of officers of\r\nhigh character and high ideals were able to avoid the fate which had\r\ncome to other educated Moslems in Turkey.  They learned to love their\r\ncountry, and with that love came a sense of shame for the results of\r\nthe despotism under which they existed.  To have lived in Paris or in\r\nBerlin was enough to make them dissatisfied; to have visited Cairo or\r\nAlexandria, Sofia or Bukarest or Athens, and to have contrasted the\r\nconditions of life in these cities, recently their own, with\r\nConstantinople, Salonika, and Smyrna, was sufficient.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible in the limits of this book to tell how this bloodless\r\nrevolution was planned by exiles abroad and officers at home.  It was\r\nsuccessful, as {182} well as bloodless, because the army refused to\r\nobey the orders of the Sultan.  To save his life and his throne, Abdul\r\nHamid was compelled to resuscitate the constitution which he had\r\ngranted, and then suppressed, at the beginning of his reign.\r\n\r\nWe who lived through those dream days of the beginning of the new\r\n_régime_ will never forget the sense of joy of an emancipated people.\r\nThe spy system was abolished, newspapers were allowed to tell the truth\r\nand express their own opinions, passports and _teskeres_ (permissions\r\nto travel from one point to another within the Empire) were declared\r\nunnecessary, _bakshish_ was refused at the custom house and police\r\nstation.  Moslem _ulema_ and Christian clergy embraced each other in\r\npublic, rode through the streets in triumph in the same carriages, and\r\nharangued the multitudes from the same platform in mosque and church.\r\nA new era of Liberty, Fraternity, and Equality, they said, had dawned\r\nfor all the races in Turkey.  The Sultan was the father, Turkey the\r\nfatherland, barriers and disabilities of creed and race had ceased to\r\nexist.  It seemed incredible, but these scenes were really happening\r\nfrom the Adriatic to the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\nOptimism, hope for the future, was so strong that one had not the heart\r\nto express very loudly his belief that no real revolution was ever\r\nbloodless, that no real change in political and social life of the\r\npeople could come in a single day or as a result of an official\r\ndocument.  No one could think of anything else but the constitution,\r\nwhich had broken the chains for Moslem and Christian alike, the\r\nconstitution which {183} was going to restore Turkey to its lawful\r\nplace among the nations of Europe, the constitution which was to heal\r\nthe sick man and solve the question of the Orient.  In Smyrna, in\r\nConstantinople, in Beirut, and in Asia Minor, I heard the same story\r\nover and over again.  But there was always the misgiving, the\r\napprehension for the future, from which the foreigner in Turkey is\r\nnever free.  It seemed too good to be true; it _was_ too good to be\r\ntrue.  It was against the logic of history.  The most wonderful\r\nconstitution that the world has ever known is that of England.  It does\r\nnot exist on paper; there is no need for a document.  It is good, and\r\nit has endured, because it has been written in blood, in suffering, and\r\nin the agony of generations, on the pages of eight centuries of\r\nhistory.  Could Turkey hope to be free in a day?\r\n\r\nThe first test of the constitution came, of course, with the election\r\nand composition of the Parliament.  The election was held quietly, in\r\nsome parts of the Empire secretly even, and when the Parliament\r\nassembled at Constantinople, one began to see already the handwriting\r\non the wall.  For its composition was in no way in accordance with the\r\ndistribution of population in the Empire.  The Turk--and by the Turk I\r\nmean the composite Moslem race which has grown up through centuries of\r\ninter-marriage and forcible conversion--had always been the ruling\r\nrace.  With the establishment of a constitutional _régime_, the Young\r\nTurks did not mean to abdicate in favour of Moslem Arabs or Christian\r\nGreeks and Armenians.  They had \"arranged\" the elections in such a way\r\nthat they would have in the {184} Parliament a substantial majority\r\nover any possible combination of other racial elements.\r\n\r\nOne cannot but have sympathy with the natural feeling of racial pride\r\nwhich is inborn in the Turks.  A race of masters,--who could expect\r\nthat they would be willing to surrender the privileges of centuries?\r\nBut they forgot that a constitutional _régime_ and the principles of\r\nLiberty, Equality, and Fraternity must necessarily imply the yielding\r\nof their unique position in the Empire.  The Turk, as a race, is\r\ncomposed of two elements, a ruling class of land-owners and military\r\nand civil officials, arrogant though courteous, corrupt though honest\r\nin private life, parasitical though self-respecting, and a peasant\r\nclass, hopelessly ignorant, lacking in energy, initiative, ambition,\r\naspirations, and ideals.  The great bulk of the Turkish element in the\r\nEmpire looked with the indifference of ignorance and the hostility of\r\njealous regard for their unique position in the community upon the\r\ngranting of a constitution.  I doubt if five per cent. of the Turkish\r\npopulation of the Empire has ever known what a constitutional _régime_\r\nmeans, or cared whether it exists or not.\r\n\r\nThere remains the five per cent.  Of these the great bulk belong either\r\nto the corrupt official class, whose subjection to the tyranny of\r\nYildiz Kiosk had totally unfitted them for service under the new\r\n_régime_ on which they were entering, and the land-owners, whose wealth\r\nwas dependent upon the unequal privileges that the law allowed to them\r\nas Moslems, and whose interests were totally at variance with the\r\nspirit of the constitution.  There are {185} left small groups of\r\nyounger army officers and of professional men, who had been educated in\r\nforeign schools or by foreign teachers in Turkey and abroad.  They\r\nwere, for the most part, either without the knowledge of any other\r\n_métier_ than the army, or, if civilian, unfitted by training and\r\nexperience for governmental executive and administrative work.\r\nConsequently from the very beginning, the genuine Young Turks who were\r\nhonest in their idealism had to make a compact with the higher army\r\nofficers and with corrupt civil officials of Abdul Hamid.  When the\r\nreal Young Turks controlled the Cabinet, their disasters were those of\r\ntheorists and visionaries.  When they yielded the control of affairs to\r\nmen more experienced than they, it was simply the renewal of the\r\ntyranny of Abdul Hamid.  It was because these two elements were united\r\nin the firm resolution to keep the control in the hands of Moslem\r\nTurks, that the constitutional _régime_ in Turkey has gone from Scylla\r\nto Charybdis without ever entering port.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning, thoughtful men pointed out that there was only\r\none way of salvation and of liberal evolution for the Ottoman Empire.\r\nThat was an honest and sincere co-operation with the Christian elements\r\nof the Empire, and with the Arabic and Albanian Moslem elements.\r\nFanaticism and racial pride prevented the Young Turks from adopting the\r\nsole possible way of establishing the constitutional _régime_.  From\r\nthe very beginning, then, they failed, and it is their failure which\r\nhas plunged Europe into the series of wars that has ended in the\r\ndevastation of unhappy Belgium, so far remote from the cause and {186}\r\nso innocent of any part in the events which brought upon her such\r\nterrible misfortunes.  One could write a whole book upon the events of\r\nthe first five years of constitutional government in Turkey and could\r\nshow, beyond a shadow of a doubt, how from the very beginning there was\r\nno honest and loyal effort made to apply even the most rudimentary\r\nprinciples of constitutional government.  Despotism means the\r\nsubjection of a country to the will of its rulers.  Constitutionalism\r\nmeans the subjection of the rulers to the will of the country.  The\r\nYoung Turks, embodied in the \"Committee of Union and Progress,\" merely\r\ncontinued the despotism of Abdul Hamid.  They were far worse than Abdul\r\nHamid, however, for they were irresponsible and unskilled.  One\r\nhandling the helm, knowing how to steer, might have kept the ship of\r\nstate afloat, all the more easily, perhaps, because the waters were so\r\ntroubled.  Many hands, none knowing where or how to go, steered the\r\nOttoman Empire to inevitable shipwreck.\r\n\r\nAlthough the vicissitudes of various Cabinets and Parliaments can have\r\nplace in our work only so far as they have a direct bearing on foreign\r\nrelations, there are six matters of internal policy which must be\r\nmentioned in order to explain how rapidly and surely the Ottoman Empire\r\nwent to its destruction; the treatment of Armenians before and after\r\nthe Adana massacres; the attempt to suppress the liberties of the\r\nOrthodox Church; the Cretan question, ending in the Greek boycott; the\r\nMacedonian policy; the Albanian uprisings; and the lack of co-operation\r\nand sympathy with the Arabs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{187}\r\n\r\nTHE ARMENIANS AND THE ADANA MASSACRES\r\n\r\nAmong the various races of the Ottoman Empire, none was more overcome\r\nwith joy at the proclamation of the constitutional _régime_ than the\r\nArmenian.  Scattered everywhere throughout the Empire, and in no region\r\nan element of preponderance, the Armenians had always made themselves\r\nfelt in the commercial and intellectual life of Turkey far out of\r\nproportion to their numerical strength.  They appreciated and\r\nunderstood, best of all the Christian populations, the significance of\r\nconstitutional government.  Honestly applied, it meant more to them\r\nthan to any other element of the Empire.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the burden of Turkish and Moslem oppression had\r\nfallen most heavily on them.  It was not only the massacres of 1894 to\r\n1896, horrible as they were, which had put the Armenians in continual\r\nfear for their lives; it was the centuries-old petty persecution, from\r\nwhich they believed they were now to be freed.  Turkish officialdom had\r\ngrown rich in extorting the last farthing from the Armenians.  Only\r\nthose who had seen this persecution and extortion can realize how large\r\na part it played in the daily life of the Armenians, and how continuous\r\nand rich a source of revenue it was to the official Turk.  For every\r\nlittle service the official expected his fat fee, always charging up to\r\nthe limit his victim was able to pay.  You could not carry on your\r\nbusiness, you could not build a house, you could not enlarge or alter\r\nor repair your shop, you could not get a tax on your harvest estimated,\r\nyou could {188} not travel even from one village to another for the\r\npurpose of business or pleasure or study, without paying the officials.\r\nVery frequently between the local Turkish official and the Armenian\r\nstood a middle man who must also be paid for the purpose of carrying\r\nthe fee or bribe to the official in charge.  How people could have\r\nlived under such a _régime_ and have prospered, is beyond the\r\ncomprehension of the Occidental.  Nothing speaks so eloquently for the\r\nbusiness acumen of the Armenian race, as well as for devotion to the\r\nreligion of its fathers.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the Armenians expected that the constitution would bring to\r\nthem a complete relief from economic repression, as well as from the\r\nterrors of massacre.  They were led to believe this by the Young Turks\r\nwho had so long plotted the overthrow of Abdul Hamid's despotism.\r\nDuring the campaign from 1890-1908, the Young Turks needed the money\r\nand the brains of Armenians in the larger centres of population where\r\nthey had their _foyers_, and in the cities abroad where they lived in\r\nexile.  It cannot be doubted that there were among the Young Turks\r\nduring the period when they had to keep alive their ideals in the fire\r\nof hope, an honest intention to give the Armenians a share in the\r\nregeneration of the Ottoman Empire.  But, as soon as they realized\r\ntheir ambitions, racial and religious fanaticism came to them with such\r\nforce that they forgot the brilliant promises as well as the\r\naffectionate intercourse of the days of suffering and struggle.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, Armenians, unlike the Greeks, the Macedonians, and\r\nthe Arabs, had, as a race, no {189} separatist tendencies.  They were\r\nnot looking towards another state to come and redeem them.  They feared\r\nRussia.  They were too scattered to hope to form, by the break-up of\r\nthe Ottoman Empire, a state of their own.  They loved the land in which\r\nthey lived with all the passion of their nature.  In many regions,\r\nTurkish was their native tongue.  They were industrious tillers of the\r\nsoil, as well as merchants.  The Sultan could have had no more loyal\r\nsubjects than these, had he so desired.\r\n\r\nAlthough the composition of the new Parliament chosen in October, 1908,\r\nand of the first constitutional Cabinet, was a prophecy of how they\r\nwere to be left out in the cold, the Armenians were throughout that\r\nwinter, when the constitution was new, firm and loyal, as well as\r\nintelligent, supporters of regenerated Turkey.  The wish was father to\r\nthe thought.  For them there was no longer the barrier of race and\r\ncreed.  All were Osmanlis, and willing to lose their identity in the\r\npolitically amalgamated race.  The reign of Abdul Hamid was a\r\nnightmare, quickly forgotten.  The future was full of hope.  If only\r\nthe Young Turks had realized what a tremendous influence the Armenians\r\ncould have played in the creation of New Turkey, if only they had been\r\nwilling to use these allies, we might have been able to write a\r\ndifferent history of the past few years in Europe.\r\n\r\nBut the awakening was to be cruel.  It came in a region of the Empire\r\nthat never before experienced the horrors of a general massacre, where\r\nChristians felt not only at ease, but on friendly terms with their\r\nMoslem neighbours.\r\n\r\n{190}\r\n\r\nOn April 14, 1909, on a morning when the sun had risen upon the\r\npeaceful and happy city of Adana, out of a clear sky came the tragedy\r\nwhich was the beginning of the end of the Ottoman Empire.  Without\r\nprovocation, the Moslem population began to attack and kill the\r\nChristians.  The Governor of the province and his military officials\r\nnot only did nothing whatever to stop the bloodshed, but they actually\r\nhanded out arms and munitions to the blood-frenzied mob of peasants,\r\nwho were pouring into the city.  For three days, killing, looting, and\r\nburning of houses were aided by the authorities.  The massacres spread\r\nwest through the great Cilician plain to Tarsus, and east over the\r\nAmanus Range into northern Syria, as far as Antioch, where the\r\nfollowers of Jesus were first called Christians.  The world, horrified\r\nby the stories which soon made their way to the newspapers, realized\r\nthat the \"bloodless revolution\" had not regenerated Turkey.  The blood\r\nhad come at last, and without the regeneration!  The Great Powers sent\r\ntheir warships to Mersina, the port of Tarsus and Adana.  Even from the\r\ndistant United States came two cruisers, under pressure, over six\r\nthousand miles.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, events of great importance, but not of equal\r\nsignificance in the future of Turkey, were taking place at\r\nConstantinople.  On the eve of the first Adana massacre, Abdul Hamid,\r\nhaving corrupted the soldiers of the Constantinople garrison, set in\r\nmotion a demonstration against the constitution.  The soldiers shot\r\ndown their officers in cold blood, marched to Yildiz Kiosk, and\r\ndemanded of the {191} Sultan the abolition of the constitution, which\r\nthey declared was at variance with the _Sheriat_, the sacred law of\r\nIslam.  Abdul Hamid gladly consented.  Popular sympathy in\r\nConstantinople and throughout the Empire was with the Sultan, as far as\r\nthe object of the revolution went.  But the way in which it was brought\r\nabout made it impossible for the Sultan to remain within the pale of\r\ncivilization.  Of all nations, none relied on its army more than\r\nTurkey.  Were the assassination of the officers to go unpunished, the\r\ndisintegration of the Empire necessarily followed.  So the military\r\nhierarchy, \"Old\" Turks as well as \"Young,\" rose against the Sultan.\r\nThe army corps in Salonika under the command of Mahmud Shevket pasha,\r\nmarched against the capital and with very little resistance mastered\r\nthe mutiny of the Constantinople garrison.  Abdul Hamid was deposed,\r\nand sent into exile at the Villa Alatini at Salonika.  His brother,\r\nReshid Mohammed, came to the throne, under the title of Mohammed V.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Young Turks found themselves again in control of the\r\nsituation, even before the proclamation of the new Sultan, they sent\r\nfrom Beirut to Adana a division of infantry to \"re-establish order.\"\r\nThese regiments disembarked at Mersina on the day Mohammed V ascended\r\nthe throne, April 25th.  Immediately upon their arrival in Adana they\r\nbegan a second massacre which was more horrible than the first.\r\nThousands were shot and burned, and more than half the city was in\r\nruins.  This second massacre occurred in spite of the fact {192} that a\r\ndozen foreign warships were by this time anchored in the harbour of\r\nMersina.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to estimate the losses of life and property in the\r\n_vilayets_ of Cilicia and northern Syria during the last two weeks of\r\nApril, 1908.  Not less than thirty thousand Armenians were massacred.\r\nThe losses of property in Adana alone were serious enough to cause the\r\nforemost fire insurance company in France to fight in the courts for\r\ntwo years the payments of its claims.  But it is not in the realm of\r\nour work to follow out the local aftermath of this terrible story.  We\r\nare interested here only in its bearing on the fortunes of the Empire\r\nand of Europe.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning, the Young Turks, now re-established in\r\nConstantinople with a Sultan of their own creation, and having nothing\r\nmore to fear from the genius and bad will of Abdul Hamid, protested\r\nbefore Europe that the massacres were due to the old _régime_ and that\r\nthey had been arranged by Abdul Hamid, whose deposition cleared them of\r\nresponsibility.  But the revelations of the _New York Herald_, the\r\n_Tribuna_ of Rome, and the _Berliner Tageblatt_, translated and\r\nreprinted in the British, French, and Russian press, were so moving\r\nthat it was necessary for the Young Turks to send special commissions\r\nto the capitals of Europe to counteract the impression of these\r\narticles.\r\n\r\nEurope was willing to accept the explanation of the Constantinople\r\nCabinet, and to continue its faith, though shaken, in the intentions of\r\nthe Young Turks to grant to the Christians of Turkey the _régime_ of\r\nequality and security of life and property {193} which the constitution\r\nguaranteed.  Even the Armenians, terrible as this blow had been, were\r\nalso willing to forgive and forget.  But the condition of forgiveness,\r\nand the proof of sincerity of the declarations of the Young Turks, both\r\nto the outside world and to the Armenians, would be the punishment of\r\nthose who had been guilty of this most horrible blot upon the\r\ncivilization of the twentieth century.  This was to be the test.\r\n\r\nThe Court-Martial, sent to Adana from Constantinople after the new\r\nSultan was established upon the throne and the Young Turks were certain\r\nof their position, had every guarantee to enable it to do its work\r\nthoroughly and justly.  It was not influenced or threatened.  There\r\nwas, however, no honest intention to give decisions impartially and in\r\naccordance with the facts that the investigation would bring forth.\r\nThe methods and findings of the Court-Martial were a travesty of\r\njustice.  Its members refused absolutely to go to the bottom of the\r\nmassacre, and to punish those who had been guilty.  I happen to be the\r\nonly foreign witness whose deposition they took.  They refused to allow\r\nme to testify against the Vali and his fellow-conspirators.  The line\r\nof conduct had been decided before their arrival.  The idea was to\r\ncondemn to death a few Moslems of the dregs of the population, who\r\nwould probably have found their way to the gallows sooner or later any\r\nway.  With them were to be hanged a number of Armenians, whose only\r\ncrime was that they had defended the lives and honour of their women\r\nand children.  The Vali of Adana, who had planned the {194} massacre\r\nand had carried it out, and two or three Moslem leaders of the city who\r\nhad co-operated with him and with the military authorities in the\r\neffort to exterminate the Armenians, were not even sent to prison.  No\r\ntestimony against them was allowed to be brought before the\r\nCourt-Martial.  They went into exile \"until the affair blew over.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a future generation has the prospective to make researches into\r\nthe downfall of the Young Turk constitutional _régime_ in Turkey, they\r\nwill probably find the beginning of the end in the failure to punish\r\nthe perpetrators of the Adana massacres.  For this was a formal\r\nnotification to the Christians of Turkey that the constitutional\r\n_régime_ brought to them no guarantees of security, or justice, but, on\r\nthe other hand, made their position in the Empire even more precarious\r\nthan it had been under the despotism of Abdul Hamid.  After Adana, the\r\nArmenian population became definitely alienated from the constitutional\r\nmovement, and was convinced that its only hope lay in the absolute\r\ndisappearance of Turkish rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE ATTEMPT TO SUPPRESS THE LIBERTIES OF\r\n  THE ORTHODOX CHURCH\r\n\r\nWhen Mohammed the Conqueror entered Constantinople in 1453, he showed a\r\nwise determination to continue the policy of his predecessors by\r\npreserving the independence of the Orthodox Church.  For he knew well\r\nthat the success of the Osmanlis had been due to religious toleration,\r\nand that no durable empire could be built in Asia Minor and the Balkan\r\n{195} Peninsula by a Moslem government, unless the liberties of the\r\nChristian inhabitants were assured through the recognition of the Greek\r\npatriarchate.  The first thing that Mohammed did was to seek out the\r\nGreek patriarch, and confirm him in his position as the political, as\r\nwell as the religious, head of Christian Ottoman subjects.\r\n\r\nIslam is a theocracy.  The spirit of its government is inspired by the\r\nsacred law, the _Sheriat_, based upon the Koran and the writings of the\r\nearliest fathers of Islam.  Down to the smallest details, the\r\norganization of the state, of the courts of justice, and of the social\r\nlife of Mohammedan peoples, is influenced by ecclesiastical law, and by\r\nthe power of the Church.  As this law does not provide for the\r\ninclusion of non-Moslem elements either in the political or social life\r\nof the nation, it has always been evident that people of another\r\nreligion, within the limits of a Moslem state, can exist only if they\r\nhave an ecclesiastical organization of their own, with well-defined\r\nliberties, privileges, and safeguards.\r\n\r\nThis principle was recognized by the Osmanlis for over five hundred\r\nyears; even the most despotic of sultans never dreamed of abandoning\r\nit.  There might be persecutions, there might be massacres, there might\r\nbe even assassination of patriarchs, but, until the Young Turk\r\n_régime_, no Ottoman ministry ever dreamed of destroying the organism\r\nwhich had made possible the life of Moslem and Christian under the same\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nThe thesis of the Young Turks was, from a theoretical standpoint,\r\nperfectly sound and just.  They {196} said that ecclesiastical autonomy\r\nwas necessary under a despotism, but that it had ceased to have a\r\n_raison d'être_ under a constitutional government.  The constitution\r\nguaranteed equal rights, irrespective of religion, to all the races of\r\nthe Empire.  Therefore the Greek Church must resign its prerogatives of\r\na political nature, for they were wholly incompatible with the idea of\r\nconstitutional government.\r\n\r\nMany foreigners, carried away by the reasonableness of this argument,\r\nseverely condemned the Orthodox Church for continuing to resist the\r\nencroachments of the new Government upon its secular\r\nprivileges--secular in both senses of the word.  They attributed the\r\nattitude of the Greek ecclesiastics to hostility to the constitution,\r\nto the reactionary tendency of every ecclesiastic organization, and to\r\nselfish desire to hold firmly the privileges which enabled them to keep\r\nin their clutches the Greek population of Turkey, and continue to enjoy\r\nthe prestige and wealth accruing to them from these privileges.  Such\r\ncriticism only revealed ignorance of history and a lack of appreciation\r\nof the real issue at stake.\r\n\r\nNo ecclesiastical organization can, under a constitutional government,\r\ncontinue indefinitely to be a state within a state, and to enjoy\r\npeculiar privileges and immunities.  But the application of the\r\nconstitution must come first.  It must enter into the life of the\r\npeople.  It must become the vital expression of their national\r\nexistence, evolved through generations of testing and experimenting.\r\nThe constitution is finally accepted and supported by a nation {197}\r\nwhen, and because, it has been found good and has come to reflect the\r\nneeds and wishes of the people.  Then, without any great trouble, the\r\necclesiastical organization will find itself gradually deprived of\r\nevery special privilege.  For the privileges will have become an\r\nanachronism.\r\n\r\nBut, just as in the establishment of the constitution, in their\r\nattitude toward the Greek Church the Young Turks acted as if the work\r\nof generations in other countries could be for them, in spite of their\r\npeculiarly delicate problems and the differences in creed involved, the\r\nact of a single moment.  This mentality of the half-educated, immature\r\nvisionary has been shown in every one of the numerous senseless and\r\ndisastrous decisions which have brought the Ottoman Empire so speedily\r\nto its ruin.\r\n\r\nThe Greek Church resisted bitterly every move of the Young Turks to\r\nbring about the immediate millennium.  The patriarch was a man of wide\r\nexperience, of sound common sense, and of undaunted courage.  Backed by\r\nthe Lay Assembly, which has always been an admirable democratic\r\ninstitution of the Orthodox Church, he refused to give up realities for\r\nchimeras.  With all its privileges and all its power, it had been hard\r\nenough for the Orthodox Church to protect the Greek subjects of Turkey.\r\nThe patriarch did not intend to surrender the safeguards by which he\r\nwas enabled to make tolerable the life of his flock for illusory and\r\nuntested guarantees.  Let the constitution become really the expression\r\nof the will of the people of Turkey, let it demonstrate the uselessness\r\nof any safeguards for {198} protecting the Christians from Moslem\r\noppression, let the era of liberty and equality and fraternity actually\r\nbe realized in the Ottoman Empire, and then the Church would resign its\r\nprivileges.  For they would be antiquated, and fall naturally into\r\ndesuetude.  But in constitutions, as in other things, the proof of the\r\npudding is in the eating.\r\n\r\nWhat the Young Turks attempted to do was to destroy the privileges of\r\nthe Orthodox Church, on the ground that these privileges were a barrier\r\nto the assimilation of the races in the Empire.  Americans, above all\r\nnations, have deep sympathies for, and well justified reasons for\r\nhaving faith in, the policy of assimilation.  Have not the various\r\nraces of Europe, different in religion and in political and social\r\ncustoms, passed wonderfully through the crucible of assimilation on\r\nAmerican soil?  But by assimilation the Young Turks meant, not the\r\namalgamation of races, each co-operating and sharing in the building up\r\nof the fatherland, as in America, but the complete subjection and\r\nultimate disappearance of all other elements in the Empire than their\r\nown.  They intended, from the very first days of the constitutional\r\n_régime_, to make Turkey a nation of Turks.  Theirs was the strong,\r\nvirile race, into which the other races would be fused.  Turkey was\r\nweak, they declared, because it was the home of a conglomeration of\r\npeoples.  If Turkey was to become like the nations of Europe, these\r\ndifferent nationalities must be destroyed.  To destroy them, the\r\nGovernment had first to aim at the _foyer_ of national life, the\r\necclesiastical hierarchies.\r\n\r\n{199}\r\n\r\nI have talked with many a zealous Young Turk.  What I have written here\r\nis not only the logical interpretation of the facts; it is also the\r\nfaithful expression of the ideas of the most earnest and intelligent\r\nTurkish partisans of the new _régime_.  They pointed out, with perfect\r\nlogic, that this process had gone on in every European country, and\r\nthat it was the only way in which a strong nation could be built.  So\r\nfar they were right.  But, aside from the fact that in Europe this\r\npolitical and social evolution had taken centuries, there was also the\r\nworking of the law of the survival of the fittest.  In European nations\r\nit had been the element, always composite, which deserved to live, that\r\nformed the nucleus of a nationality.  The whole root of the question in\r\nTurkey was, were the Young Turks justified in believing that the Turk\r\nwas this element?\r\n\r\nThere is not space to discuss the reasons for the supremacy of the\r\nOsmanli in the Ottoman Empire.  Up to the eighteenth century, the\r\nOsmanli was undoubtedly the \"fittest\" element.  For the past two\r\nhundred years, the continued domination of Turk and the continued\r\nsubjection of Christian populations, in Turkey, has been due to causes\r\noutside of the Empire.  The Turk has remained the ruling race.  But is\r\nhe still the fittest?  One may examine the different elements of the\r\nOttoman Empire, and measure them by the tests of civilization.  From\r\nthe intellectual standpoint, from the business standpoint, from the\r\nadministrative standpoint, the Turk is hardly able to sustain his claim\r\nto continue to be, in a twentieth-century empire, the element which can\r\n{200} hope to assimilate Greek, Armenian, Albanian, Slav, and Arab.  He\r\nis less fit than any of the others, especially than the Greek and\r\nArmenian in intellectual and business faculties, and than the Albanian\r\nin administrative faculties.  There remains, then, as his sole claim to\r\ndominate the other races, his physical superiority.  By history and by\r\nlegend, he is the fighting man and rules by right of conquest and force.\r\n\r\nIt was always the sane--and only safe--policy of the Turks to keep\r\nChristians out of the army.  They saw to it that the _métier_ of arms\r\nremained wholly to the Moslems.  In spite of the increasing wealth and\r\neducation of the Christian elements of the Empire, the ascendancy was\r\npreserved to the Turk through the army.  But at what a sacrifice!  By\r\nreason of military service, the Turkish peasant has been kept in\r\neconomic and intellectual serfdom, while his Christian neighbour\r\nprogressed.  The Turkish population has actually decreased, and the\r\nravages of garrison life, due to dyspepsia and syphilis, have\r\ndiminished fearfully the physical vigour of the race.  By the same\r\ntoken, the upper classes, knowing only the life of army officers, have\r\nbeen removed from the necessity of competing in the world for position\r\nand success.  Can manhood be formed in any other mould than that of\r\ncompetition, where the goal is achievement, and is reached only by\r\ncontinued effort of will and brain?  The upper class Turk is a\r\nparasite, and, like all parasites, helpless when that upon which he\r\nfeeds is taken from him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map--Europe in 1911]\r\n\r\n{201}\r\n\r\nThe attack of the Young Turk party upon the Greek Church failed.  The\r\npatriarch refused to surrender his privileges.  The Greek clergy and\r\nthe Lay Council held out under persecution and threats.  In October,\r\n1910, when the Lay Council met in Constantinople, its members were\r\narrested, and thrown into jail.  In Macedonia and Thrace, in the Ægean\r\nIslands, along the coast of Asia Minor, the bishops and clergy suffered\r\nuntold persecutions.  Some were even assassinated.  I shall never\r\nforget a memorable interview I had with Joachim III, during that\r\ncrisis.  His Holiness untied with trembling fingers the _dossier_ of\r\npersecutions, which contained letters and sworn statements from a dozen\r\ndioceses.  \"They treat us like dogs!\" he cried.  \"Never under Abdul\r\nHamid or any Sultan have my people suffered as they are suffering now.\r\nBut we are too strong for them.  We refuse to be exterminated.  I see\r\nall Europe stained with blood because of these crimes.\"  How prophetic\r\nthese words as I record them now!\r\n\r\nThe Turk could not hope to assimilate the Greek by peaceful methods,\r\nbecause he was his intellectual inferior.  When he planned to use\r\nforce, the Balkan Alliance was formed.  The battle of Lulé Burgas took\r\naway from the Turk his last claim to fitness as dominant race.  He\r\ncould no longer fight better than Christians.  The first Balkan War\r\ngave the _coup de grâce_ to the final--and has it not been all along\r\nthe only?--argument for Turkish racial supremacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRETAN QUESTION AND THE GREEK BOYCOTT\r\n\r\nThe island of Crete had long been to Turkey, in relation to Greece,\r\nwhat Cuba had been to Spain, in {202} relation to the United States.\r\nIn both cases, and about the same time, wars of liberation broke out.\r\nBut Greece was not as fortunate in her efforts for the emancipation of\r\nan enslaved and continually rebellious population as was the United\r\nStates.  Powerless and humiliated, after the war of 1897, Greece could\r\nno longer hope to have a voice, by reason of her own force, in the\r\ndirection of Cretan affairs.  Crete became the foundling of European\r\ndiplomacy.\r\n\r\nTogether with the declaration of Bulgarian independence, and the\r\nannexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary, the Young\r\nTurks had to face a decree of the Cretan assembly to the effect that\r\nCrete was indissolubly united to the kingdom of Greece.  The Young\r\nTurks could do nothing against Bulgaria.  For the ceremony of Tirnovo\r\nhad been no more than the _de jure_ sanction of a _de facto_ condition.\r\nThe only cause for conflict, the question of the railroads in eastern\r\nRumelia, was solved by Russian diplomacy.  Against Austria-Hungary a\r\nboycott was declared.  It resulted in a few successful attempts to\r\nprevent the landing of mails and freights from Austrian steamers, and\r\nin the tearing up of several million fezes which were of Austrian\r\nmanufacture.  These, by the way, were soon replaced by new fezes from\r\nthe same factories.  The Sublime Porte settled the Bosnia-Herzegovina\r\nquestion by accepting a money payment from Austria-Hungary.\r\n\r\nAll the rancour resulting from these losses and humiliation, all the\r\nvials of wrath, were poured upon the head of Greece.  The Cretan\r\nquestion became {203} the foremost problem in European diplomacy.  The\r\nCretans stubbornly refused to listen to the Powers, and decided to\r\nmaintain their decision to belong to Greece.  But Greece was threatened\r\nwith war by Turkey, if she did not refuse to accept the annexation\r\ndecree voted by the Cretans themselves.  In order to prevent Turkey\r\nfrom attacking Greece, the Powers decided to use force against the\r\nCretans.  Turkey, not satisfied with the efforts of the Powers to\r\npreserve the Ottoman sovereignty and Ottoman pride in Crete, demanded\r\nstill more of Greece.  She asked that the Greek Parliament should not\r\nonly declare its disinterestedness in Crete, but should take upon\r\nitself the obligation to maintain that disinterestedness in the future.\r\n\r\nTo go into all the tortuous phases of the Cretan question up to the\r\ntime of the Balkan War would make this chapter out of proportion; and\r\nyet Crete, like Alsace-Lorraine, has had a most vital influence upon\r\nthe present European war.  The one point to be emphasized here is, that\r\nto bring pressure to bear upon Greece in defining her attitude toward\r\nCrete, the Young Turks decided to revive the commercial boycott which\r\nthey had used against Austria.  I have seen from close range the\r\nnotorious Greek boycott of 1910 to 1912.  It was far more disastrous to\r\nthe Turks than to the Greeks of Turkey.  It threatened so completely,\r\nhowever, the economic prosperity of Greece, which is a commercial\r\nrather than an agricultural country, that it forced Greece into the\r\nBalkan Alliance much against her will, for the sake of\r\nself-preservation.\r\n\r\n{204}\r\n\r\nIf this boycott had been carried on against the Greeks of Greece alone,\r\nit would not have affected vitally the prosperity of the Greeks in the\r\nOttoman Empire.  Their imports come from every country, and for their\r\nexports the freight steamers of all the European nations competed.  But\r\nit was directed also against the Greeks who were Ottoman subjects.  In\r\nSalonika, Constantinople, Trebizond, Smyrna, and other ports, commerce\r\nwas entirely in the hands of Greeks.  They owned almost every steamer\r\nbearing the Ottoman flag.  They owned the cargoes.  They bought and\r\nsold the merchandise.  The Young Turks, working through the _hamals_ or\r\nlongshoremen and the boatmen who manned the lighters,--all Turks and\r\nKurds,--succeeded in tying up absolutely the commerce of Ottoman\r\nGreeks.  The Greek merchants and shippers were ruined.  It was urged\r\ncleverly that this was the chance for Moslems to get the trade of the\r\ngreat ports of Turkey into their own hands.  The Government encouraged\r\nthem by buying and maintaining steamship lines.  But the Turks had no\r\nknowledge of commerce, no money to buy goods, and no inclination to do\r\nthe work and accept the responsibilities necessary for successful\r\ncommercial undertakings.  The result was that imports were stopped,\r\nprices went up, and the Moslems were hurt as much as, if not more than,\r\nthe Christians.  After several voyages, the new government passenger\r\nvessels were practically _hors de combat_.  There was no longer first,\r\nsecond, and third class.  Peasants squatted on the decks and in the\r\nsaloons.  Filth reigned supreme, and hopeless confusion.  No {205}\r\nEuropean could endure a voyage on one of these steamers, and no\r\nmerchant cared to entrust his shipments to them.\r\n\r\nThe boycott died because it was a hopeless undertaking.  For many\r\nmonths, the Government lost heavily through the falling off in the\r\ncustom house receipts.  The labouring class (almost wholly Moslems) of\r\nthe seaports suffered terribly, as our labouring class suffers during a\r\nprolonged strike.  The boycott was removed, Greeks were allowed to\r\nresume their business, so essential for the prosperity of the\r\ncommunity, and, as is always the case in Turkey, everything worked\r\nagain in the same old way.\r\n\r\nBut, just as the failure to punish the perpetrators of the Adana\r\nmassacre alienated definitely and irrevocably the sympathy and loyal\r\nsupport of the Armenian element from the constitutional _régime_, so\r\nthe boycott, iniquitous and futile, lost to the Young Turks the\r\nallegiance of the Greeks of the Empire.  Already alarmed by the attack\r\nupon the liberties of the patriarchate, the Greeks began to look to\r\nGreece for help; and, in the islands of the Ægean and in Macedonia, the\r\nhope was strong that a successful war might put an end to what they\r\nwere suffering.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks of Turkey are not free from the universal characteristic of\r\nhuman nature.  You can persecute and browbeat a man, you can bully him\r\nand do him physical injury, you can refuse him a share in the\r\ngovernment and put him in an inferior social position, and he will\r\ncontinue to endure it.  But, {206} rob him of the chance of making a\r\nlivelihood, and he will commence to conspire against the government.  A\r\nman's vital point is his pocket-book.  That vital point the Young Turks\r\nthreatened by their boycott.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG TURKS AND THE MACEDONIAN PROBLEM\r\n\r\nIt was at Salonika that the Young Turk movement first gained its\r\nfooting in the Ottoman Empire, and until the loss of European Turkey,\r\nafter the disastrous war with the Balkan States, Salonika continued to\r\nbe the centre of the \"Committee of Union and Progress.\"  Its congresses\r\nwere always held there.  From Salonika the third army corps went forth\r\nto suppress, in April, 1909, the counter-revolution in Constantinople.\r\nTo the Young Turks, Salonika seemed the safest place in all the Ottoman\r\ndominions for the imprisonment of Abdul Hamid.  Many of the leading\r\nmembers of the party were natives of Macedonia.  In fact, it was\r\nbecause the Young Turks saw clearly that European Turkey would soon be\r\nlost to the Empire, unless there was a regeneration, that they\r\nprecipitated in 1908 the revolution which had so long been brewing.\r\n\r\nIt is natural, then, that the Macedonian problem should be the first\r\nand uppermost of all the many problems that had to be solved in the\r\nregeneration of Turkey.  The \"Committee of Union and Progress\" saw that\r\nimmediate action must be taken to strengthen Ottoman authority, so\r\nseverely shaken since the war with Russia, in the European _vilayets_.\r\n\r\nWe have already shown in a previous chapter how {207} the struggle of\r\nraces in European Turkey had made Macedonia the bloody centre of Balkan\r\nrivalry, and had reduced the _vilayets_ of Uskub and Salonika to\r\nanarchy.\r\n\r\nUp to the coming of the constitutional _régime_, there had been a very\r\nstrong element in Macedonia, principally Bulgarian, which saw--oh, how\r\nprophetically!--that the liberation of Macedonia from Turkish rule\r\nwould endanger, rather than aid, the propaganda for eventual Bulgarian\r\nhegemony in the Balkan Peninsula.  These Bulgarians, wise in their day\r\nand generation beyond their emancipated brethren, advocated the\r\nintervention of Bulgarian arms, not to secure independence, but\r\nautonomy.  They felt that by the creation, for a period of years, of an\r\nautonomous province of Macedonia under the suzerainty of the Sultan,\r\nthe felicitous history of Eastern Rumelia would repeat itself.\r\n\r\nThe Young Turks decided to solve the Macedonian problem by\r\nstrengthening the Moslem element in every corner of the _vilayets_ of\r\nSalonika and Uskub.  The means of doing this were at hand.  After the\r\nannexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Turkish agents began to work\r\namong the Moslem population in these countries to induce them to\r\nemigrate and come under the dominion of the \"Padishah,\" as the Sultan\r\nis called by his faithful subjects.  They were brought in and settled,\r\nwith the help of the Government, in those districts of Macedonia where\r\nthe Moslem element was weak.  This was a repetition of the policy of\r\nAbdul Hamid after the Congress of Berlin, when, in Eastern Rumelia and\r\nThrace, {208} to oppose the Bulgarians Circassians from the lost\r\nCaucasus were settled, and to oppose the Servians Albanian emigration\r\ninto old Servia and the Sandjak of Novi Bazar was encouraged.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, the Young Turks decided to secure the loyalty of\r\ntheir Christian subjects in European Turkey by abolishing the _karadj_\r\n(head tax) which exempted Christians from military service.\r\nBulgarians, Greeks, and Servians were summoned to serve in the Ottoman\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nThe first of these measures should never have been adopted.  The bitter\r\nexperience of former years should have taught the Young Turks the\r\nlesson that emigration of this nature not only tended to arouse\r\nreligious fanaticism, but also introduced an element, ignorant and\r\nunruly, and wholly worthless from the economic point of view.  It has\r\noften been recorded that Moslems, prompted to the sacrifice of\r\nabandoning everything for their love of remaining Turkish subjects,\r\nhave made these \"treks\" after the unsuccessful wars of Turkey _of their\r\nown initiative_.  Nothing is farther from the truth.  There has never\r\nbeen an exodus of this sort which has not been due to the instigation\r\nof political agents.  From the very fact that large industrious and\r\ninfluential Moslem elements have remained and prospered under Russian,\r\nBulgarian, and Austrian rule, it can be inferred that those who yielded\r\nto the solicitation of Turkish agents were the undesirable Moslem\r\nelement, who, never having acquired anything where they were, had\r\nnothing to lose by making a change.  If one excepts a certain portion\r\nof the Circassians, the {209} statement may well be made that these\r\nemigrants--_muhadjirs_ they are called in Turkish--are an element\r\nforming the lowest dregs of the population, as worthless and shiftless\r\nas the great majority of the Jews whom the Zionist movement has\r\nattracted to Palestine.  More than this, the _muhadjirs_ have been\r\nfanatical and lawless, and it is they whose massacres of Christians\r\nhave invariably ended in irretrievable disaster for Turkey.\r\n\r\nIn Macedonia, the muhadjirs, in conjunction with the Albanian Moslem\r\nimmigrants, were responsible for the succession of massacres in 1912,\r\nsuch as those of Ishtip and Kotchana, which helped to bring about the\r\nBalkan alliance.  The same thing is happening to-day in the coast towns\r\nof Asia Minor and Thrace, where the brutality and blood lust of the\r\n_muhadjirs_ since 1913 will eventually cause another attack of Greece\r\nupon Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe second policy--that of enrolling Christians in the army--was\r\nrecorded, back in the days of the first attempt at the emancipation of\r\nChristians, the _Tanzimat_ of 1839, as a measure which would ameliorate\r\ntheir lot and bring about equality.  The idea was splendid, but its\r\napplication was impracticable.  Ottoman Christians are so wholly\r\nincompatible, from their social and educational background, with\r\nOttoman Moslems, that they cannot be placed in the army, in mixed\r\nregiments, without incurring humiliation, degradation, and persecution\r\nof the most cruel sort.\r\n\r\nThe only way in which Christians could be called to serve in the\r\nOttoman army would have been the formation, at first, of separate\r\nregiments, where the {210} soldiers would enjoy immunity from\r\npersecution.  When this reform was made, there should have been also a\r\nprovision from the very first, that the ranks of officers be recruited\r\nfrom the Christian elements in the Empire, in proportion to their\r\nnumerical strength.  But with both Christians and Jews, obligatory army\r\nservice was used from the beginning--it is still used today--as a means\r\nof extorting money from those who could pay, and terrorizing and\r\nreducing to slavery those who could not raise the forty pounds required\r\nfor exemption.  Even if there were no religious fanaticism, even if it\r\nwere not necessary for Christians of intelligence to serve in an army\r\nwholly officered by Moslems, the terrible and criminal conditions of\r\nservice which they were called upon to suffer would have justified the\r\nChristians in adopting every possible measure to avoid military service.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Empire, intelligent Christians who could not purchase\r\ntheir freedom from this obligation preferred exile to military service.\r\nFrom 1909 to 1914, Turkey has lost hundreds of thousands of its best\r\nyoung blood.\r\n\r\nThe result in Macedonia of the coming of the _muhadjirs_ and the taking\r\nof Christians for the army, was that the Macedonians abandoned their\r\nadvocacy of autonomy, under the suzerainty of the Sultan, and looked to\r\nthe Balkan States for freedom from Turkish rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALBANIAN UPRISINGS\r\n\r\nAlbania was never fully conquered by the Osmanlis.  Like the\r\nMontenegrins, the Albanians were always {211} able to resist the\r\nextension of Turkish authority in their mountains.  Not only did the\r\nnature of the country favour them, but their proximity to the Adriatic,\r\nand their ability to call at will for Italian and Austrian help, made\r\nit advisable for the Supreme Porte to compromise with them.  Many\r\nAlbanians, including principally, as in Bosnia, the landowning\r\nfamilies, were converted to Mohammedanism, and attached themselves to\r\nthe fortunes of Turkey.  Without ever giving up their local\r\nindependence, these renegade Albanians became the most loyal and\r\nefficient supporters of Ottoman authority _outside of Albania_.\r\n\r\nTurkey has gained much from the Albanians.  Her higher classes, endowed\r\nwith extreme intelligence and physical activity, have been the most\r\nvaluable civil and military officials that the Government has ever\r\nenjoyed.  Because they were Moslems, they were able to take high\r\npositions in the army and government service.  It is one of the most\r\nremarkable facts of Ottoman history that the great majority of the\r\nreally great statesmen and soldiers of the Empire, if not of Christian\r\nancestry, have been, and still are, Albanians.  In strengthening the\r\nTurkish domination in the European provinces, after the period of\r\ndecline set in, the Albanians have been indispensable.  Their\r\nemigration from their mountains into Epirus, Old Servia, the valley of\r\nthe Vardar, and the coast towns of Macedonia checked for a long time\r\nthe conspiracies and rebellions of the Christian elements.\r\n\r\nThe Sultans of Turkey and their counsellors have always recognized the\r\nvalue of the Albanians.  In {212} return for their great services to\r\nthe Empire, they were allowed to retain their local privileges.  This\r\nmeant independence, in reality, rather than autonomy.  They gave what\r\ntaxes they pleased, or none.  Military service was rendered upon their\r\nown terms.  Christian Albanians, as well as Moslem, have preferred\r\nOttoman sovereignty to any other.  They have never thought of\r\nindependence, because this would have brought them responsibilities and\r\ndangers from which, under the fetish of \"the integrity of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire,\" they were free.  So they resisted every effort of Italian,\r\nAustrian, Slav, and Greek to weaken their allegiance to the Sultan.\r\nTurkey also allowed them to remain under the mediæval conditions in\r\nwhich they lived back in the fourteenth century.  They wanted neither\r\nrailways, roads, nor ports.  Among all the subjects of the Sultan, the\r\nAlbanians were best satisfied with the absolute lack of progress under\r\nMoslem rule.  These are the reasons why the majority of Albanians want\r\nto return once more to the fold of Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe Young Turks were no more felicitous in their treatment of the\r\nAlbanians than of the Greeks and Armenians.  Without any consideration\r\nof the peculiar problems involved, they decided immediately, tackling\r\nevery problem at once, that Albania must be civilized and that Ottoman\r\nsovereignty must work there in exactly the same way as in any other\r\npart of the Empire.  Albanians must render military service, and submit\r\nto being sent wherever the authorities at Constantinople decided.\r\nLocal independence must cease.  Taxes must be paid regularly.  When the\r\n{213} Albanians resisted, as they did immediately, an army was sent to\r\npacify the country.\r\n\r\nOne cannot but sympathize with the principle laid down by the Minister\r\nof the Interior at Constantinople, that the central authority must be\r\nrecognized and that the only way to stamp out the Albanian anarchy was\r\nto disarm the population.  But the Young Turks knew no other way of\r\ndoing this than by force.  They did not realize that anarchy and\r\nlawlessness disappear only with education and economic progress.\r\nInstead of starting to \"civilize\" the Albanians by establishing schools\r\nand opening up the country with railways, they sent rapid-firing guns.\r\nIn the summer of 1909, the rebellion was stamped out with ruthless\r\ncruelty by the burning of villages, the destruction of crops, and the\r\nseizing of cattle.  Such measures were a very poor argument for the\r\nAlbanian to induce him to comply with the disarmament decree.  Under\r\nordinary circumstances an Albanian would rather lose his leg than his\r\ngun.  Under these circumstances, he preferred risking his life to\r\ngiving up what he considered his only means of defence.\r\n\r\nEvery year the Albanian rebellion broke out afresh.  Every year the\r\nYoung Turks exhausted the strength and spent the resources of their\r\narmies in European Turkey against the invulnerable mountains of\r\nAlbania.  After every \"pacification,\" Albania in arms was just as\r\ncertain each May as the coming again of summer.\r\n\r\nIn 1912, when affairs were in a critical state as regards the Christian\r\nneighbours, the Cabinet in {214} Constantinople was once more engaged\r\nin the hopeless task of subduing Albanian opposition.  The Albanians,\r\nhowever, seemed to gain strength rather than lose it.  In September,\r\n1912, I was in Uskub just four weeks before the Balkan War broke out.\r\nThe Albanian chieftains were there, having made a truce for Ramazan\r\n(the sacred month of the Moslem fasting).  They said to me that the\r\nnext year, if the Turks did not stop persecuting them, they would take\r\ntheir army to Constantinople.  Others were to get ahead of them, and\r\nthey were to win their independence without having to fight the Turks\r\nagain.  The poor showing of the Turkish arms against the Greeks and\r\nServians is very largely due to the exhaustion which had come to them\r\nthrough continuous and unsuccessful attempts to get the better of the\r\nAlbanian uprisings.  The Balkan States knew how severely the western\r\nMacedonian army had suffered in July and August, 1912.  It was one of\r\nthe considerations which decided them to strike at that moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TREATMENT OF THE ARABIC ELEMENT\r\n\r\nIn Asiatic Turkey there are supposed to be about eight million\r\nArabic-speaking inhabitants.  These figures may be an exaggeration, for\r\nno census has ever been taken.  But the _vilayets_ are occupied almost\r\nexclusively by Arabs and races speaking Arabic.  They form a half of\r\nthe Empire's dominions in Asia, starting with the Taurus and Amanus\r\nranges, south through Syria to Arabia and east and south-east through\r\nMesopotamia to the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\n{215}\r\n\r\nThese large stretches of territory were never thoroughly conquered by\r\nthe Turks.  They did not settle there in the way they had done in the\r\nBalkan Peninsula, outside of Albania and Montenegro, and in Asia Minor.\r\nThe race from whom they had taken their religion and from whom they\r\nsoon absorbed whatever culture and art they can be said to possess, was\r\nnever assimilated by the Turks.  Their simple warrior and herdsman\r\nlanguage was enriched by Arabic substantives, as Anglo-Saxon was\r\nenriched by the Latin gotten through the Normans and through the\r\nChurch.  But there was no racial fusion.\r\n\r\nOnly in appearance did Turkish officialdom and the authority of the\r\nSultan ever get a real hold over the Arabs.  By habit they came to\r\nrespect the Sultan as Khalif.  The allegiance which they gave him as\r\nruler was altogether without value--a pure matter of form.  An\r\naggressive pasha found it easy to detach Egypt from Turkish rule.  It\r\nwas conglomerate populations and a lack of natural boundaries for\r\nforming states that prevented the other Arabic portions of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire from following Egypt.  In Arabia proper, and in the larger\r\nportion of Mesopotamia, up to the present day, the Arabs have been as\r\nindependent of the Sublime Porte as have been the Albanians.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Abdul Hamid, when the idea of the Pan-Islamic movement\r\nwas conceived, the importance of joining the sacred cities of Medina\r\nand Mecca more closely with the Turkish Empire was recognized.  French\r\ninterests were building a railway across the Lebanon Mountains to\r\nAleppo and Damascus.  The {216} Germans had launched their project for\r\nthe _Bagdadbahn_.  Abdul Hamid decided to create a railway directly\r\nunder government control, from Damascus to Medina and Mecca.  For the\r\nfirst time since they were joined to the Ottoman Empire, the Arabic\r\nprovinces saw themselves in prospective connection with the capital.\r\nIt had been for a long time easier and quicker to go from\r\nConstantinople to the United States or to China than to Bagdad or to\r\nMecca.  The railways would have one of two results: either the Arabs\r\nwould be brought more closely into connection with the Empire, or they\r\nwould be definitely alienated from it.\r\n\r\nThe Arabic question stood thus when the constitution was re-established\r\nin 1908.  There are many Arabs among the Young Turks, but these, like\r\nthe Slavs in the military and official service of Austria-Hungary, have\r\nbeen definitely alienated from their own nationality.  Here was the\r\nopportunity to bring into sympathy with the constitutional movement the\r\nmillions of Arabic-speaking subjects of the Sultan, who formed the most\r\nnumerous Moslem element in the Empire.  But the Young Turks were no\r\nmore tactful in the treatment of the Arabs, who were mostly of their\r\nown religion, than of the Greeks and Armenians.  In the first\r\nParliament, they were almost as unfair to Moslem Arabs as to\r\nChristians.  In the apportionment of places in the Cabinet, the Arabs\r\nwere ignored.  It is true that some Cabinet members, some high\r\nofficials both in the military and civil administration, and some\r\nmembers of the inner council of the Committee of Union and Progress\r\n{217} were of Arabic origin.  But they must be counted practically as\r\nTurks, for they had lived so long away from their own country and their\r\npeople that they had lost all Arabic sympathies.  Some who were called\r\nArabs were in reality members of the old Turkish families, who in\r\nMesopotamia, as in Syria and Egypt, had received large tracts of land\r\nat the time of the conquest, and had always been Turks by interests and\r\nby atmosphere.  The younger nationalistic Arabic element, educated, and\r\nliving by professional or business interests in cities of the Arabic\r\nportion of the Empire, were from the very beginning ignored.\r\n\r\nTwo things soon became evident.  In the first place, the Young Turks\r\ntried to impose their language in local administration as the sole\r\nofficial language of the Empire.  In many places in Syria and\r\nMesopotamia, civil officials, even in the courts of justice, were\r\nappointed without a knowledge of the language of the people among whom\r\nthey had to serve.  In the Balkans and in Asia Minor, where there were\r\nso many races and so many tongues, the Turks were acting reasonably and\r\nsensibly in imposing their own language as a medium for the transaction\r\nof government business, but in _vilayets_ which were _wholly_ Arabic\r\nspeaking, the foisting of the Turkish language upon the people could be\r\nlikened to a bastard child endeavouring to rule the branch of his\r\nfamily from which he had received his best and purest blood.  Before a\r\nyear had passed, the educated, intellectual Arabs were wholly out of\r\nsympathy with the new _régime_.  Many of them began to dream of the\r\nrevival of {218} the Arabian khalifate, and looked to the nationalistic\r\nmovement in Egypt as the seed from which their Pan-Arabic tree would\r\nsome day grow.  Others, older and less sentimental, did not hesitate to\r\nexpress a desire to see British or French sovereignty extended over\r\nSyria and Mesopotamia.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, among the quasi-independent tribes of the Syrian\r\n_hinterland_, and of the Arabian peninsula, the attempt of the Turks to\r\ndestroy their privileges ended in the same way as it had done in\r\nAlbania.  From 1908 up to the outbreak of the Balkan War, millions of\r\ntreasure and thousands of the best soldiers of the Empire were lost in\r\nfruitless efforts to realize the aspirations of the Young Turks.  We\r\ncannot even enumerate these rebellions.  They were as perennial as the\r\nAlbanian uprisings, and as disastrous to the Turkish army.  In Arabia,\r\nrebellious Arabs treated with the Italians.  In Syria, beyond the\r\nJordan, they made a practice of tearing up the tracks and burning the\r\nstations of the Hedjaz railway.  In Mesopotamia, they refused to\r\nrespond to the obligation of military service.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis incomplete summary of the Young Turk _régime_ in the Ottoman\r\nEmpire has been given to throw light upon the collapse of the\r\nconstitutional _régime_ and of the military reputation of Turkey.  I\r\nhave refrained from going into a discussion of party politics, of\r\nintrigues, and of the bickerings of Parliament.  Enough has been told\r\nto show that the constitutional _régime_ was marked for failure from\r\nthe beginning for three reasons: There was no honest {219} attempt to\r\nbring together the various races of the Empire in a common effort for\r\nregeneration.  The Young Turks, having no statesmen among their\r\nleaders, depended upon untrained men and upon those Abdul Hamid had\r\ntrained in sycophancy and despotism.  In spite of the heroic and able\r\nefforts of the German military mission and the British naval mission,\r\nno progress was made in reforming the only force by which the Young\r\nTurks could have held in respect and obedience the Sultan's own\r\nsubjects, as well as those foreign nations who were looking for the\r\nopportunity to dismember the Empire.\r\n\r\nIf the hopes of the true friends of Turkey had been realized, if only\r\nthe constitution had been applied, if only there had been the _will_ to\r\nregenerate Turkey, all the wars of the past few years, including the\r\none which is now shaking Europe to its foundations, would have been\r\navoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{220}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nCRETE AND EUROPEAN DIPLOMACY\r\n\r\nOn November 19, 1910, the Cretan General Assembly made a stirring\r\nappeal \"to the four Great Powers who are protectors of the island, to\r\nthe two great Powers of Central Europe, to the great Republic of the\r\nNew World, to the liberal and enlightened press of two Continents, and\r\nin general to all Christians, in favour of the rights of the Cretan\r\npeople which it represents,--rights acquired and made legal by so many\r\nsacrifices and sufferings.\"  The Cretans definitely included the United\r\nStates and the American press in this manifesto.  They wanted the\r\nAmerican people to become acquainted with what was known to the\r\nchancelleries of Europe as \"the Cretan question.\"  For one fifth of the\r\nCretans have members of their families in America.  There are few\r\nhamlets in the island into which the spirit and influence of \"the great\r\nRepublic of the New World\" has not penetrated.\r\n\r\nA review of the relationship between Crete and the European Powers is\r\nas necessary in trying to throw light upon the events which led up to\r\nthe war of 1914 as is the exposition of the later phases of the\r\nAlbanian question.  It helps us to grasp the attitude {221} of the\r\nPowers towards Turkey in the years immediately after the proclamation\r\nof the constitution, the tremendous power of Hellenism under the wise\r\nand skilful guidance of a statesman such as M. Venizelos has proved\r\nhimself to be, the importance of the Cretan question in precipitating\r\nthe Balkan Wars, and the impotence of European diplomacy to preserve\r\nthe _status quo_, and decide _ex cathedra_ the destinies of countries\r\nlike Crete and Macedonia, whose emancipated kinsfolk had acquired the\r\nspirit of the soldiers who sang:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"As Christ died to make men holy, let us die to make men free.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA century ago, Crete was cut off from the outside world.  It had been\r\nfor two hundred and fifty years under the Turks, who took a peculiar\r\npride in the island from the fact that it was their last great\r\nconquest.  Its Christian inhabitants, although forming the majority of\r\nthe population, lived, or rather existed, under the same hopeless\r\nconditions as prevailed throughout Turkey.  In the sea-coast towns the\r\nChristians prospered better than the Moslems, owing to their aptitude\r\nfor commerce; but the bulk of the Christian population was in abject\r\nslavery to the Turkish _beys_, who were the great landowners.\r\n\r\nThe Greek war of liberation was shared in by the Cretans, who lent\r\nvaluable aid to their brethren of the mainland.  They endured all the\r\nsufferings of the war, but reaped none of its rewards.  It is quite\r\npossible that they might have thrown off the Turkish yoke at that\r\nfavourable moment had it not been for {222} the astute policy of the\r\nTurks, who, seeing the danger of losing Crete, handed it over to\r\nMehemet Ali in 1830 as a reward for Egyptian aid in the Greek war and\r\ncompensation for the ships destroyed at Navarino.  With the downfall of\r\nMehemet Ali's schemes of conquest in 1840, the island reverted to\r\nTurkey.  At this time the Powers could easily have united Crete with\r\nGreece, but deliberately sacrificed the Cretans to their commercial\r\nrivalries.\r\n\r\nTurkey never succeeded in gaining her former ascendancy in Crete.\r\nInsurrection after insurrection was drowned in blood.  During two\r\ngenerations the Turks sent into the unhappy island successive armies,\r\nwhose orgies of cruelty and lust are better left undescribed.  But the\r\ntortures of hell could not extinguish the flames of liberty.  Every few\r\nyears the Cretans would rise again and repay blood with blood until\r\nthey were overwhelmed by Anatolian soldiers, of whom Turkey possesses\r\nan unlimited supply.\r\n\r\nAt the Congress of Berlin in 1878 the Greeks pled, with much force, for\r\nthe privilege of annexing Crete.  As we read them to-day, the arguments\r\nof M. Delyannis are a prophecy.  The Powers put Crete back under\r\nOttoman control, subject to a reformed constitution called the Pact of\r\nHolepa, which provided a fairly good administration, if a capable and\r\nsincere governor were chosen.  Everything went well until Sultan Abdul\r\nHamid in 1889 practically annulled the solemn agreement he had made by\r\nappointing a Moslem Governor-General, and reducing the representation\r\nin the General Assembly in such a way that the Moslem minority in the\r\nisland came into {223} power again.  It would be fruitless to go into\r\nthe complex history of the next seven years during which the\r\nlawlessness of former times was revived.\r\n\r\nChristian refugees fled to Greece and carried the tale of their\r\nsufferings.  A massacre in Canea in February, 1897, engineered by\r\nTurkish officers fresh from similar work in Armenia, had such a\r\nrepercussion in Greece that King George would have lost his throne had\r\nhe remained deaf to the popular demand that aid be sent to the Cretans.\r\nGreek soldiers crossed to the stricken island.  This meant war with\r\nTurkey.  In a few weeks Greece was overwhelmed in Thessaly, and the\r\nPowers were compelled to intervene.  Much ridicule has been cast upon\r\nGreece for her impotence in the war of 1897.  Her defeat was a foregone\r\nconclusion, and she was severely blamed for having jeopardized the\r\npeace of Europe just as the Balkan States are being blamed to-day.\r\n\r\nBut there are times when a nation simply has to fight.  So it was with\r\nGreece in 1897.  In exactly similar circumstances, but with conditions\r\nless serious and an issue not so long outstanding or so vital to\r\nnational well-being, the United States a year later declared war on\r\nSpain.  There was great similarity between the Cretan situation in 1897\r\nand that of 1912 in Crete and Macedonia.  Refugees, crossing the\r\nborders and telling unspeakable tales to their brothers of blood and\r\nreligion, were continually before the eyes of the Bulgarians and\r\nServians and Montenegrins and Greeks since the proclamation of the\r\nconstitution in 1908.  Each nationality suffered {224} by massacres in\r\nMacedonia which were followed by no serious punishment.\r\n\r\nEven though defeated in 1897, Greece forced the hand of the Powers and\r\nof Turkey.  Crete was given autonomy, and placed under the protection\r\nof Italy, Great Britain, France, and Russia, who occupied the principal\r\nports of the island.  For a year and a half they searched for a\r\n\"neutral\" governor for the Cretans.  The Turkish troops, however,\r\nremained at Candia, leaving the rest of the island to the\r\nrevolutionaries.  It was not until the British were attacked in the\r\nharbour of Candia, and their Vice-Consul murdered, that the Powers\r\nmoved.  But, as at Alexandria in 1882, it was a bluff admiral and not\r\nthe diplomats who settled the status of the island.  The Turkish troops\r\nwere compelled to withdraw, and the Powers were told that they would\r\neither have to appease the Cretans by some encouragement of their\r\naspirations or conquer the island by force.  A way out of the dilemma\r\nwas found in the appointment of Prince George of Greece as High\r\nCommissioner of the protecting Powers in Crete.\r\n\r\nHere is where the Powers, if they had at that time any intention of\r\n\"preserving the rights of Turkey\" in Crete, made the first of their\r\nblunders.  To call the son of the King of Greece to the chief\r\nmagistracy of an island which had so long aspired to political union\r\nwith Greece was, in the eyes of the people, a direct encouragement to\r\ntheir aspirations.  How could they think otherwise?  The Turkish\r\nCretans, too, regarded this step as the end of Ottoman sovereignty, for\r\nthey emigrated in so great a number that soon the {225} Moslem\r\npopulation was reduced to ten per cent.  Prince George's appointment,\r\nmade in December, 1898, was for three years, but really lasted eight.\r\nIn 1906 he withdrew because he had become hopelessly involved in party\r\npolitics, and had \"backed the wrong horses.\"\r\n\r\nNow comes the second blunder, _unless the Powers were preparing Crete\r\nfor union with Greece_.  They sent a letter to the King of Greece,\r\nasking him to appoint a successor to his son!  Let me quote from the\r\nexact wording of this letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The protecting Powers, in order to manifest their desire to take into\r\naccount as far as possible the aspirations of the Cretan people, and to\r\nrecognize in a practical manner the interest which His Hellenic Majesty\r\nmust always take in the prosperity of Crete, are in accord to propose\r\nto His Majesty that hereafter, whenever the post of High Commissioner\r\nof Crete shall become vacant, His Majesty, after confidential\r\nconsultations with the representatives of the Powers at Athens, will\r\ndesignate a candidate capable of exercising the mandate of the Powers\r\nin this island....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTurkey naturally protested against the change in the _status quo_ which\r\nsuch a step implied, and pointed out that it was a virtual destruction\r\neven of the _suzerainty_ of the Sultan.  The Powers, however, did not\r\nobject to the publication of their note to the King of Greece in the\r\nnewspapers of Crete.  M. Zaimis, a former prime minister of Greece, was\r\nappointed High Commissioner.  The island had its own flag and postage\r\nstamps, and laws identical with those of {226} Greece.  Cretan officers\r\nin Greek uniform commanded the militia and constabulary of the island.\r\nTurkey treated Crete as a foreign country.  For this statement there is\r\nno more conclusive proof than the records of the custom-houses at\r\nSmyrna and Salonika which show that Cretan products were subjected to\r\nthe same duties as were applied to all foreign imports.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, then, that Crete was in practically the same position as\r\nEastern Roumelia in 1885, or, in fact, as Bulgaria herself.  Nothing\r\nwas more natural than that the establishment of a constitutional\r\n_régime_ in Turkey should lead to a proclamation of union with Greece.\r\nThe motives which led to this action were identical with those which\r\nAustria-Hungary put forth as an explanation of her annexation of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina.  The Cretans quite justly feared that the Young Turks\r\nwould repudiate the obligations assumed by Abdul Hamid, and endeavour\r\nto bring Crete back into the Turkish fold.  At the moment Turkey was so\r\nengrossed in the question of the Austrian annexation and the Bulgarian\r\ndeclaration of independence and seizure of the railways in Eastern\r\nRoumelia that she contented herself with a formal protest against the\r\naction of the Cretan Assembly.\r\n\r\nWhat did the Powers do?  Turkey, at the moment, could have done nothing\r\nhad they recognized the union with Greece.  But they did not want to go\r\nthat far.  On the other hand, they did not want to offend Greece and\r\nthe Cretans.  They made no threats, and took no action, although their\r\ntroops were in the island.  Inaction and indecision were made worse by\r\n{227} the following note, which was sent by the four Consuls at Candia\r\nto the self-appointed provisional government:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned, agents of France, Great Britain, Italy, and Russia,\r\nby order of their respective governments, have the honour of bringing\r\nto the knowledge of the Cretan government (_sic_) that the protecting\r\nPowers consider the union of Crete to Greece as depending upon the\r\nassent of the Powers who have contracted obligations with Turkey.\r\nNevertheless they would not refuse to envisage with kindly and\r\nsympathetic interest the discussion of this question with Turkey, if\r\norder is maintained in the island and if the safety of the Moslem\r\npopulation is secured.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThat diplomatic sanction would sooner or later be given to the action\r\nof the Cretans, if they showed their ability to preserve order in the\r\nisland and treat the Moslems well, is an altogether justifiable\r\ninterpretation of this note of the Powers.  Otherwise would they not\r\nhave protested against the illegality of the provisional government,\r\nand have forbidden the Cretan authorities to promulgate their decrees\r\nin the name of King George?  Although the High Commissioner had\r\ndisappeared, and the Cretans were running the island just as if the\r\nannexation were an assured fact, the Powers, far from protesting,\r\nannounced their intention of withdrawing their troops of occupation!\r\n\r\nWhat were their intentions concerning Crete, and what was their\r\nunderstanding of the _status quo_ at the moment of withdrawal?  This\r\nquestion they did not {228} answer then, nor did they answer it\r\nafterwards.  They simply withdrew from the island without stating what\r\nlegal power was to succeed them.  This was in the summer of 1909.  M.\r\nVenizelos, then Prime Minister of Crete, asked the Powers to state\r\ndefinitely their intentions.  He said that he did not wish to run\r\ncounter to the orders of the Powers, but that he would have to raise\r\nthe flag of Greece over the island when their troops left, unless they\r\n_formally_ forbade him to do so.  With admirable clearness and\r\nirrefutable logic he pointed out to the Powers that the only other\r\nalternative would be anarchy.  But the Powers, pressed by their\r\nambassadors at Constantinople, were afraid to assent to annexation.\r\nThey were equally averse to taking the opposite course.  So they\r\ncontented themselves with giving M. Venizelos \"friendly counsels\" not\r\nto hoist the Greek flag.  The result was the ludicrous spectacle of the\r\ncutting down of the Greek flag by marines landed from eight warships.\r\nIt was like a scene from a comic opera, and M. Venizelos must have\r\nformed then the opinion which every succeeding action of the Powers\r\nstrengthened and to which he gave expression after the Balkan War was\r\ndeclared--that the Powers were \"venerable old women.\"\r\n\r\nCrete now began to be menaced by the insensate chauvinism of the Young\r\nTurks, who thought they could avenge the loss of Bosnia-Herzegovina and\r\nthe Bulgarian declaration of independence by destroying the autonomy of\r\nCrete and re-establishing the authority of the Sultan in this island\r\nwhich had been repudiating the Ottoman government for eighty {229}\r\nyears.  In the spring of 1910, the _Tanine_, at that time official\r\norgan of the Committee of Union and Progress, laid down five points as\r\nthe _minimum_ which the Porte would accept in the definite and\r\npermanent solution of the status of Crete:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"1. Formal recognition of the rights of the Sultan.\r\n\r\n\"2. The right of the Sultan to name the Governor-General of the island\r\namong three Cretan candidates elected by the General Assembly.\r\n\r\n\"3. The right of the _sheik-ul-islam_ to name the religious chiefs of\r\nthe Cretan Moslems.\r\n\r\n\"4. Establishment in the Bay of Suda of a coaling-station for the\r\nOttoman fleet, and the maintenance there of a permanent _stationnaire_\r\nlike the _stationnaires_ of the embassies at Constantinople.\r\n\r\n\"5. Restriction of the rights of the Cretan government in the matter of\r\nconclusion of treaties of commerce and agreements with foreign powers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat the \"rights of the Sultan\" might be were not specified then, nor\r\nhave they been since: but articles four and five were enough to throw\r\nthe whole of Crete into a state of wildest excitement.  The Turks,\r\nafter having lost the island, were trying to win it back.\r\n\r\nLeft to themselves (as they had every reason to believe) the Cretans\r\nconvoked the National Assembly for April 26, 1910.  The Assembly was\r\nopened in the name of George I., King of the Hellenes.  The Moslem\r\ndeputies immediately presented a protest in which they rejected the\r\nsovereignty of Greece over Crete.  The deputies were then asked to take\r\nthe oath of allegiance in the name of King George.  A second petition\r\nwas presented by the {230} Moslem deputies, declaring that, as the\r\nSultan of Turkey held \"sovereign rights\" in the island, they, in the\r\nname of their Moslem constituents, protested against such an action.\r\nThey refused to take the oath.  Should they be excluded from the\r\nAssembly, or be allowed to sit without taking the oath?\r\n\r\nInstead of insisting on the admission of the Moslem deputies, the\r\nPowers again gave \"friendly counsels.\"  Once more M. Venizelos pleaded\r\nthat they speak out their mind in the matter of the legal status of the\r\nisland.  The diplomats \"temporized\" again, and the warships reappeared\r\nto assure to the Moslem deputies \"their lawful rights.\"  When M.\r\nVenizelos could get no statement from the Powers as to the grounds upon\r\nwhich these \"lawful rights\" rested, he saw that all hope of help from\r\nthe Powers was over, and that he was only wasting his time.  Like\r\nCavour, when he turned with disgust from his efforts to interest the\r\nPowers and had the inspiration, _Italia fara da se_, the Cretan leader\r\nabandoned the antechamber of the chancelleries.  While the Powers still\r\nsought a _modus vivendi_ for Crete, M. Venizelos made one.  From that\r\nmoment the Balkan War was a certainty.\r\n\r\nThe Young Turk Cabinet, arrogant and drunk with the success of their\r\nboycott against Austria-Hungary, and at the same time knowing that they\r\nmust turn public attention away from the loss of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, began to press the Powers for the restoration in Crete of\r\nthe _status quo_ as it had existed before the diplomatic blunders I\r\nhave outlined above, and, in addition, for the coaling station and for\r\ncontrol over Crete's foreign relations.  At {231} the same time, they\r\ndemanded of the Athens Cabinet that Greece renounce formally, not only\r\nfor the present _but also for the future_, any intention of annexing\r\nCrete.  The Young Turks represented that public opinion in Turkey was\r\nso wrought up over the Cretan question that war with Greece would\r\ncertainly follow.  To illustrate to the Powers and to Greece the force\r\nof this public opinion, a widespread boycott against everything Greek\r\nin Turkey was started.  This economic warfare is described in another\r\nchapter.  In some parts of Turkey the boycott has never ceased.  There\r\nis no doubt that this boycott was one of the very most important\r\nfactors in bringing on the Balkan War.  For it taught the Greeks, who\r\nwere continually being bullied and threatened with an invasion in\r\nThessaly, the imperative necessity of reconciliation with Bulgaria by a\r\ncompromise of rival claims in Macedonia.\r\n\r\nThinking that he could serve his country better in Greece than in\r\nCrete, M. Venizelos posed his candidacy to the Greek Chamber in the\r\nsummer of 1910.  Seemingly he was abandoning Crete to its fate, and he\r\nhad to bear many unjust reproaches from his fellow-countrymen.  His\r\nwonderful personality and extraordinary political genius soon brought\r\nhim to the front in Greece.  The Cretan revolutionary became Prime\r\nMinister of Greece.  Steadfast in his purpose he began to negotiate\r\nwith the other Balkan States and with Russia.  He was able to\r\naccomplish the impossible.  The war with Turkey is largely his personal\r\nsuccess.  No statesman since Bismarck has had so brilliant a triumph.\r\n\r\n{232}\r\n\r\nIn 1910, M. Venizelos took the step which was the turning point in his\r\ncareer and in the history of Greece.  Firmly persuaded that Crete could\r\nbe annexed to Greece only by Greece proving herself stronger than\r\nTurkey, and not by diplomatic manoeuvres, he decided to desert Cretan\r\npolitics, and enter the larger sphere open to him at Athens.  It was\r\neasy to secure a seat in the Greek Parliament, but that was the only\r\neasy part about it.  When one considered the fickle character of the\r\nGreek people in their politics, the selfish narrowness and bitter\r\nprejudices of their leaders, the inefficiency of the army and navy,\r\nwhose officers had been ruined by political activity, the emptiness of\r\nthe treasury, the unpopularity of the royal family, and the general\r\ndisorder throughout the country, it seems incredible that M. Venizelos\r\nshould have been willing to assume the responsibility of government,\r\nlet alone succeed in his self-imposed task.  Had you asked the leading\r\nstatesmen of Europe five years ago what country presented the most\r\nformidable and at the same time most hopeless task tor a Premier, there\r\nwould have been unanimity in selecting Greece.\r\n\r\nBut for Eleutherios Venizelos there was no difficulty which could not\r\nbe overcome.  It is the nature of the man to refuse to see failure\r\nahead.  \"If one loves to work, and works for love,\" he has declared,\r\n\"failure does not exist.\"\r\n\r\nCalled to be Prime Minister in August, 1910, M. Venezelos began to\r\nreform everything in sight.  His first step was to endow Greece with a\r\nnew constitution, whose most important changes were a Council of {233}\r\nState, chosen for life and irremovable, to act as a Senate (Greece has\r\nsingle-chamber government), legalizing the state of siege, sanctioning\r\nthe employment of foreigners in the service of the Government, fixing\r\ntwenty-four hours as the maximum delay for bringing one who had been\r\narrested before a magistrate, forbidding the publication of uncensored\r\nnews relative to military and naval operations in time of war,\r\nestablishing free, obligatory primary instruction, excluding from\r\nParliament directors in corporations, and facilitating the\r\nexpropriation of property for public purposes.  I have given enough to\r\nshow the practical character of the new constitution.\r\n\r\nAlthough strongly urged to do so, both by the King and by the political\r\nleaders, M. Venizelos refused to turn his Constituent Assembly into an\r\nordinary Parliament, and proceed to the legislation made possible by\r\nthe new constitution.  Seeing clearly that durable and effective\r\nministerial power could be derived only from the people and supported\r\nonly by their intelligent good-will, he balked the intrigues of the\r\npoliticians, and overcame the dynastic fears of the King.  The\r\nConstituent Assembly was dissolved.  M. Venizelos went before the\r\npeople, travelling everywhere and explaining his program for the\r\nreformation of the country.  The result was a triumph such as no man\r\nhas ever received in modern Greece.  In November, 1910, followers of M.\r\nVenizelos were returned in so overwhelming a majority that he could\r\nafford to ignore the Athenian politicians who saw in him a menace to\r\ntheir personal rule, their sloth, and their \"graft.\"\r\n\r\n{234}\r\n\r\nSince that day M. Venizelos has been the idol of Greece.  Never has\r\ntrust in public man been more amply justified.  Every administration of\r\nthe State was completely transformed within eighteen months.  Even to\r\noutline what M. Venizelos has accomplished reads like a fairy tale.\r\nOnly those who knew the Greece before his arrival and are able to\r\ncontrast it with the Greece of today can appreciate the immensity of\r\nhis labours and the radical character of the changes he has made.  I\r\ncannot dwell on the talent shown by this Cretan in matters of financial\r\nreform.  But his military and naval reforms, and his foreign policy,\r\nhave been so important in making possible the Balkan alliance and its\r\nsuccesses that they cannot be passed over.\r\n\r\nM. Venizelos, when he first came to Athens, saw what was the matter\r\nwith the Greek military and naval establishments.  Like Peter the Great\r\nand the Japanese, he realized that the Greeks must learn from Europe by\r\nsubmitting to European teachers.  To persuade his fellow-countrymen,\r\nwho have a very exalted opinion of their own ability (the Greeks are\r\nalways sure they were born to command, without first having learned to\r\nobey!), that they must not only call in foreign advisers, but must\r\nsubmit to their authority, has been the most Herculean of the tasks\r\nthis great man set before him.  Article three of the new constitution\r\nhad authorized the appointment of foreigners as officers of the\r\nGovernment and given them temporarily Hellenic citizenship.  From\r\nEngland was asked a naval mission, from France a military mission, and\r\nfrom {235} Italy officers to reorganize the _gendarmerie_.  In Greece\r\nthe foreign officers were able to accomplish more in eighteen months\r\nthan the foreign \"advisers\" of Turkey had accomplished in many long\r\nyears.  This is no assertion of personal opinion.  The facts of the\r\nBalkan War speak for themselves.  Why is this?  In Turkey, the foreign\r\nteachers have never been given any real authority, and have seen every\r\neffort they put forth nullified by the insouciance, self-sufficiency,\r\nand cursed apathy of the Turk.  The Greeks, on the contrary, \"became as\r\nlittle children,\" and lo! a miracle was wrought!\r\n\r\nWhen foreigners who visited Greece within recent years read about the\r\nsuccesses of the Crown Prince at Salonika and Janina, the assassination\r\nof King George, the mourning of the Greek people, and the hearty\r\nacclamation of King Constantine, the national hero, they could think\r\nback to less than four years ago when the Crown Prince was practically\r\nbanished from Greece, after having been dismissed from his command in\r\nthe army by a popular uprising, and when the portrait of the King was\r\nremoved from every coffee-house in Athens.  What is the cause of the\r\ncomplete revulsion in public feeling towards the dynasty?  It is due to\r\nthe common sense of M. Venizelos.  He saw that the present dynasty was\r\nnecessary for Greece, and that the Crown Prince must come back and take\r\ncommand of the army.  In defiance of public opinion, he insisted on\r\nthis point.  This attitude was a bitter disappointment to many who\r\nimagined that M. Venizelos would be anti-dynastic in his policy.  As a\r\nresult of his {236} success in reconciling the Greeks with their\r\nsovereign and his family, the sympathies of Russia and Germany and\r\nGreat Britain were not alienated from the Greek people, as was rapidly\r\nbecoming the case.  Emperor William especially, whose sister is wife of\r\nthe new Greek King, was so delighted with the success of M. Venizelos\r\nin rehabilitating his brother-in-law that he asked the Greek Premier to\r\nvisit him at Corfu.\r\n\r\nThis visit of the former Cretan revolutionary to the German Emperor in\r\nApril, 1912, was hardly commented upon by the European press.  But\r\nepoch-making words must have been spoken in the villa Achilleion, for\r\nimmediately after that visit the semi-official German press began to\r\nprepare the public for the events which were to take place in the\r\nBalkans.  The eloquence and remorseless logic which had carried the day\r\namong Cretan insurgents and Greek electors was not lost on the\r\n\"war-lord of Europe.\"  Emperor William carried back to Berlin the\r\nconviction that no diplomacy could outwit the Greek Premier's\r\ndetermination that Turkey should disappear from Crete and Macedonia.\r\n\r\nI do not think I am exaggerating in saying that when the Young Turks,\r\nby their insensate chauvinism, caused M. Venizelos to despair of saving\r\nCrete through Crete itself, they signed their own death-warrant.  If\r\nthey had refrained from their boycott and let Crete alone, would M.\r\nVenizelos have gone to Greece?  I think not.  It is one of those\r\nstrange coincidences of history that on the very day when Mahmud\r\nShevket pasha, in the Ottoman Parliament, {237} declared that if Greece\r\ndid not make a public statement to the effect that she had no intention\r\nat any time to extend her sovereignty over Crete, a million Turkish\r\nbayonets would gleam upon the plains of Thessaly, Eleutherios Venizelos\r\nwas quietly leaving Crete for Athens.\r\n\r\nTo bring together Greece, Bulgaria, Servia, and Montenegro into an\r\nalliance which would drive the Turk out of Europe was in the mind of M.\r\nVenizelos as far back as the summer of 1909, when he saw the\r\ninternational fleet at Canea land marines to cut down the Greek flag\r\nwhich he had raised.  It became an obsession with him.  It was\r\npossible, because he believed it was possible.  But no one else\r\nregarded it as more than an idle dream.  The rare friends to whom M.\r\nVenizelos vaguely hinted that such an alliance was the only way of\r\nsolving the Balkan question called it the \"acme of absurdity.\"  I quote\r\nthe words of an eminent diplomat to whom this solution was mentioned.\r\nAt the opening of the Italian War, when I suggested to the Turkish\r\nGrand Vizier that such an alliance was possible, he looked at me\r\npityingly, and said, \"The questions you ask display your ignorance of\r\nconditions in this part of the world.  My time is too valuable to\r\ndiscuss such an impossible hypothesis.  Go to Hussein Hilmi pasha, and\r\nask him if he thinks the Greeks and Bulgarians could ever unite.\"\r\nHussein Hilmi pasha referred me to every single book that has ever been\r\nwritten about the Macedonian question.  \"I do not care which you read,\"\r\nsaid the ex-Governor-General of Macedonia, \"they all tell the same\r\nstory.\"\r\n\r\n{238}\r\n\r\nBut M. Venizelos was not asking himself, \"Can I do it?\" but, \"How shall\r\nI do it?\"  Once more he saw clearly.  The pan-Hellenic national ideal\r\nmust be given up.  Greece must content herself with Epiros, the Ægean\r\nIslands, Crete, and a slice of Macedonia west of the Vardar--possibly\r\nincluding Salonika, if the army proved as victory-winning as those of\r\nBulgaria and Servia.  Everything else must be left to Bulgaria and\r\nServia.  When first proposed to the leaders of Greece, this proposition\r\nseemed so preposterous that M. Venizelos was accused of being a traitor\r\nto Hellenism.  He is still denounced by the fanatics, after all that he\r\nhas accomplished.  But patiently he built up his argument, using all\r\nhis magnetism and his eloquence to convince his colleagues.  He showed\r\nhow Greece was being constantly humiliated and menaced by the\r\nchauvinism of the Young Turks, how the boycott was ruining Greek\r\nshipping, how Crete itself would gradually get to like independence\r\nbetter than union with Greece, and how inevitable it was that the Slavs\r\nshould in the course of time come to possess Thrace and Macedonia.\r\nInstead of sacrificing everything to Bulgaria, he maintained, \"this is\r\nour only chance to get any part of European Turkey.  We must give up\r\nour ideal, because it is impracticable.  With Bulgaria, we can crush\r\nTurkey.  Without Bulgaria, Turkey will crush us.  And if Bulgaria\r\nhelps, we must pay the price.\"  It may be years--not until archives are\r\nopen to historians and memoirs of present actors are published--before\r\neverything is clear concerning the formation of an alliance which was\r\nas great a surprise {239} to Europe as it was to Turkey.  But the\r\nfamous telegram which M. Gueshoff, Prime Minister of Bulgaria,\r\naddressed to his colleagues at Athens after the first successes of the\r\nwar were won, is sufficient testimony to the essential part played by\r\nM. Venizelos in forming the coalition.\r\n\r\nAfter M. Venizelos left Crete, a last blunder made the protecting\r\nPowers the laughing-stock of Europe.  The Cretans elected deputies to\r\nthe Greek Chamber, and the warships of the Powers played hide-and-seek\r\nwith small Cretan craft in a fruitless endeavour to prevent the chosen\r\ndeputies from proceeding to Athens.  This move was altogether\r\nunnecessary, for they had not yet learned the matchless worth of their\r\nopponent.  M. Venizelos, knowing that Greece and her new allies were\r\nnot yet ready for war with Turkey, \"tipped off\" both the Cretans and\r\nthe leaders in the Greek Parliament that they would have to wait one or\r\ntwo years longer.  But, to satisfy the _hoi polloi_ on the one hand and\r\nthe diplomats on the other, a little comedy was enacted before the\r\nParliament House in Athens which threw wool over everybody's eyes.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he saw that war was inevitable and that his allies were\r\nready, M. Venizelos admitted the Cretan deputies.  Europe was face to\r\nface with a _fait accompli_.  The Cretan and Macedonian questions were\r\nsettled by war.  The hand of Turkey and the diplomats was forced.\r\n\r\nNow we see the importance of the Cretan question.  The Balkan War could\r\nhave been avoided by a courageous and straightforward policy of\r\nefficient {240} protection of Christians who lived under the Ottoman\r\nflag.  It is because the Powers did not fulfil the obligations of the\r\nTreaty of Berlin, and sacrificed Cretans and Bulgarians and Servians\r\nand Greeks to the furthering of their commercial interests at\r\nConstantinople, that all Europe is now stained with blood.  By\r\nflattering the Turk and condoning his crimes, the Powers succeeded in\r\ndestroying the \"integrity of the Ottoman Empire,\" which they professed\r\nto uphold.  In trying to be the friends of the Turk they proved his\r\nworst enemies.\r\n\r\nThe Cretan question is a commentary upon the utter futility of\r\ninsincere and procrastinating diplomacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{241}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE WAR BETWEEN ITALY AND TURKEY\r\n\r\nSince the days when Mazzini, looking beyond the almost irrealizable\r\ndream of Italian unity, said in his Paris exile, \"North Africa will\r\nbelong to Italy,\" a new Punic conquest has been the steadfast hope of\r\nthe Italians.  France had already started her conquest of Algeria when\r\nMazzini spoke, and was mistress of the richest portion of the southern\r\nMediterranean littoral before the Italian unification was completed.\r\nLate though they were in the race, the Italians began to try to realize\r\ntheir dream by sending thousands of colonists to Egypt and to Tunis.\r\nBut the events of the years 1881-1883 in these two countries,\r\nconsummated by the Convention of London in 1885, gave Egypt to England\r\nand Tunis to France.  Italy was too weak at the time to protest, and\r\nGermany had not yet begun to develop her _Weltpolitik_.\r\n\r\nFor some years Italian colonial aspirations were directed towards\r\nSomaliland and Abyssinia.  The battle of Adowa in 1896 was a death-blow\r\nto the hopes of founding an Italian empire of Erythrea.  Ten years ago\r\nGiolitti received a portfolio in the Zanardelli ministry, and ever\r\nsince then there has {242} been a new Cato at Rome, crying \"Tripoli\r\nmust be taken.\"  By the Franco-Italian protocol of 1901, it was agreed\r\nthat if France should ever extend her protectorate over Morocco, Italy\r\nshould have the Tripolitaine and Barca, with the Fezzan as a\r\n_hinterland_.  This \"right\" of Italy was recognized at the\r\ninternational conference of Algeciras in 1906, and has since been\r\naccepted in principle by the European cabinets.\r\n\r\nDuring the past decade Italy quietly prepared to seize\r\nTripoli,--peacefully, if possible, and if not, by force.  Had Italy\r\nbeen ready, Turkey would have lost Tripoli in the autumn of 1908, when\r\nBulgaria declared her independence and Austria annexed Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina.  Internal politics made a bold stroke impossible at that\r\nfavourable moment.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish her purpose, Italy worked along two lines.  She tried to\r\nmake her economic position so strong in Tripoli that the country would\r\nvirtually belong to her and be exploited by her without any necessity\r\nfor a change in its political status, until Arabs and Berbers, choosing\r\nbetween prosperity under Italy and poverty under Turkey, would of their\r\nown accord expel the Turks.  Foreseeing a possibility of failure in\r\nthis plan, she at the same time prepared for a forcible occupation of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the Anglo-Boer War, the Italian Ministries of War and\r\nMarine began to make a study of the question of transporting troops and\r\nlanding them under the cover of a fleet.  Tourists who were in Italy\r\nduring the summer of 1904 will remember the famous dress rehearsal of\r\nthe Tenth Army Corps.\r\n\r\n{243}\r\n\r\nSome six thousand men, completely provided with horses, ammunition,\r\nartillery, and provisions, were embarked in eleven hours.  The convoy\r\nput to sea, escorted by a squadron of battleships and torpedo-boats, in\r\ntwo columns of five transports each.  Despite a heavy swell, these\r\ntroops and all their stores were landed in the Bay of Naples in sixteen\r\nhours.  I wonder if many who were watching and applauding on that\r\nmemorable day understood why Italy was practising so assiduously\r\nlanding from transports,--and under the protection of the fleet.  For\r\nwhat war was she preparing in time of peace?  In 1907, the Minister of\r\nMarine announced in the _Italia Militare_ that Italy could send seventy\r\nthousand troops upon a distant expedition oversea and one hundred and\r\nfourteen thousand _for a short journey not exceeding two nights at sea_!\r\n\r\nThe peaceable conquest of Tripoli was cleverly conceived, and has been\r\nfaithfully tried.  Branches of the Banco di Roma were established at\r\nTripoli and Benghazi, and, for the first time since the days of\r\nImperial Rome, a serious attempt was made to develop the agricultural\r\nand commercial resources of the country.  The natives were encouraged\r\nin every enterprise, and managed in such a way that they became--in the\r\nvicinity of the seaports and trading-posts, at least--dependent for\r\ntheir livelihood upon the Banco di Roma.  Italian steamship lines,\r\nheavily subsidized, maintained regular and frequent services between\r\nTunis and Tripoli and Benghazi and Derna and Alexandria.  The more\r\nenterprising natives travelled for a few piastres to {244} Alexandria,\r\nand the object-lesson of contrast was left without words to work its\r\neffect upon them.  The admirable Italian parcel post system--one of the\r\nmost successful in Europe--extended its operations into the\r\n_hinterland_ and captured the ostrich feather trade.  The Italians\r\nbegan to talk of making secure the routes to Ghadames and Ghat and\r\nMurzuk, and of establishing for the interior postal and banking\r\nfacilities that these regions could never hope to have under Turkish\r\nadministration.  Railways were contemplated as soon as they could be\r\nfinanced entirely by Italian capital.\r\n\r\nThe Italian schemes were working beautifully when the birth of New\r\nTurkey in the revolution of July, 1908, changed the whole situation.\r\nThe indolent and corrupt officials of the _vilayet_ of Tripoli and\r\n_sandjak_ of Benghazi, whose attention had been turned from Italian\r\nactivities by Italian gold pieces, were replaced by members of the\r\nUnion and Progress party.  These new officials, owing to their utter\r\ninexperience and their sense of self-esteem, may have been no better\r\nthan the old ones; probably they proved as inefficient, for executive\r\npower is not inherent in the Turkish character.  But they were men who\r\nhad passed through the fire of persecution and suffering for love of\r\ntheir fatherland, and the renaissance of Turkey was the supreme thing\r\nin their lives.  Their patriotism and enthusiasm knew no bounds.  Their\r\nambitions for Turkey may have been far in advance of their ability to\r\nserve her.  But criticism is silent before patriotism which has proved\r\nits willingness to sacrifice Life for country.\r\n\r\n{245}\r\n\r\nOne can imagine the feelings of the Young Turks when they saw what\r\nItaly was doing.  It is easy enough to say that they should have\r\nimmediately reformed the administration of the country and given to the\r\nTripolitans an efficient government.  Reform does not come in a\r\ntwelvemonth, and the Young Turks had to act quickly to prevent the loss\r\nof Tripoli.  They took the only means they had.  They began to thwart\r\nand obstruct every Italian enterprise, to extend the military frontiers\r\nof Tripoli into the Soudan, to bring all the Moslem tribes of Africa\r\ninto touch with the Constantinople khalifate.\r\n\r\nItaly saw her hopes being destroyed as other colonial hopes had been\r\ndestroyed one after the other.  Representations at Constantinople were\r\nwithout effect.  The more her ambassador tried, the more he realized\r\nthe hopelessness of his case.  Surely it was a fruitless diplomatic\r\ntask to persuade Young Turkey that her officials in Tripoli and\r\nBenghazi should be forbidden to hinder the onward march of Italian\r\n\"peaceable conquest.\"  The Italian economic fabric in Tripoli, so\r\ncarefully and so patiently built, seemed to be for nothing.\r\nAustria-Hungary had begun the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire by\r\nthe annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908.  No Power had\r\nsuccessfully protested, much less the helpless Turks.  So Italy began\r\nto prepare her coup.\r\n\r\nThe crisis could not be precipitated.  Italian public opinion, wary of\r\ncolonial enterprises since the terrible Abyssinian disaster, and\r\nopposed to the imposition of fresh taxes, had to be carefully prepared\r\nto sustain the Ministry in a hostile action against Turkey.\r\n\r\n{246}\r\n\r\nIn January, 1911, the Italian press began to publish articles on\r\nTripoli, dilating upon its economic value and its vital importance to\r\nItaly, if she were to hold her place among the great Powers of Europe.\r\nEvery little Turkish persecution--and there were many of them--was made\r\nthe subject of a first-page bit of telegraphic news.  The Italian\r\npeople were worked up to believe that not only in Tripoli, but\r\nelsewhere, the Young Turks were showing their contempt for Italian\r\nofficials and for the Italian flag.  An Italian sailing vessel was\r\nseized at Hodeidah in the Red Sea; the incident was magnified.  An\r\nAmerican archæological expedition was granted a concession in Tripoli;\r\na similar concession had been refused to Italian applicants.  The\r\nnewspapers pretended that the Americans were really prospecting for\r\nsulphur mines, whose development would mean disaster to the great mines\r\nin Sicily!  French troops reached the Oasis of Ghadames; the\r\n_hinterland_ of Tripoli was threatened by the extension of French\r\nsovereignty into the Sahara.  At this moment the reopening of the\r\nMorocco question by the Agadir incident gave Italy the incentive and\r\nthe encouragement to show her hand.\r\n\r\nIn September, the press campaign against the Turkish treatment of\r\nItalians in Tripoli became daily and violent.  Signor Giolitti\r\nsucceeded in getting all parties, except the extreme Socialists, to\r\npromise their support.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the last moment that the Sublime Porte realized the\r\ndanger.  On September 26th, the _Derna_, a transport, arrived at\r\nTripoli, with {247} much-needed munitions of war.  There had been a\r\nshameful neglect to keep up the garrisons in the African provinces, and\r\nwhen it was too late--as is so often the case at Constantinople--there\r\ndawned the realization that the provinces were practically without\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\nOn September 27th, the first of the series of ultimatums which have\r\nbrought all Europe into war was delivered to the Sublime Porte.  Italy\r\ngave Turkey forty-eight hours to consent to the occupation of Tripoli,\r\nwith the proviso of the Sultan's sovereignty under the Italian\r\nprotectorate, and the payment of an annual subsidy into the Ottoman\r\nTreasury.  In Italy, two classes were mobilized, General Caneva\r\nembarked his troops upon transports that had already been prepared, and\r\nthe Italian fleet proceeded to Tripoli.\r\n\r\nThe Turks did not believe that there would be war.  On the afternoon of\r\nSeptember 29th, the Grand Vizier, as far-seeing in his understanding of\r\ninternational affairs as he was blind in grasping what was best for\r\nTurkey's interests, told me that he was sure Italy would hesitate\r\nbefore entering upon a war that would be the prelude to the greatest\r\ncatastrophe that the world has ever known.  \"Italy will not draw the\r\nsword,\" he declared, \"because she knows that if she does attack us, all\r\nEurope will be eventually drawn into the bloodiest struggle of\r\nhistory,--a struggle that has always been certain to follow the\r\ndestruction of the integrity of the Ottoman Empire.\"  Hakki pasha was\r\nright, except in one important particular.  Perhaps Italy did know what\r\nan attack upon Turkey {248} would eventually lead to.  But two hours\r\nafter my conversation with the Grand Vizier, he received a declaration\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the news of the declaration of war, Constantinople\r\nlearned that the first shots had already been fired.  Without waiting\r\nfor any formalities, the Italian fleet had attacked and sunk Turkish\r\ntorpedo-boats off Preveza at the mouth of the Adriatic.  The Turkish\r\nfleet had just left Beirut to return to Constantinople, and for three\r\ndays it was feared that the Italians would follow up their offensive by\r\ndestroying the naval power of Turkey.  They did not do so, although it\r\nwould have been an easy victory.  For it was the hope of the Giolitti\r\nCabinet that there would be no real war.\r\n\r\nThe attack at Preveza had a double purpose of preventing the\r\ntorpedo-boats from interfering with the Italian commerce, and of\r\nstriking terror into the hearts of the Turks.  The Italians did not\r\nwant to widen the breach and draw upon themselves the hatred and enmity\r\nof Turkey by sinking her navy.  Such an action would make difficult the\r\nnegotiations which they still hoped to pursue.  It was not war against\r\nthe people of Turkey that they had declared; that was a mere form.\r\nWhat they wanted was a pretext for seizing Tripoli.  So naval and\r\nmilitary operations were directed not against Turkey, but against the\r\ncoveted African provinces.  Considerations of international diplomacy,\r\nalso, dictated this policy.\r\n\r\nThe Italian warships opened fire upon Tripoli on September 30th.  On\r\nOctober 2d and 3d, the forts {249} were dismantled and the garrison\r\ndriven out of the city by the bombardment.  On October 5th, Tripoli\r\nsurrendered.  The expeditionary corps disembarked on the 11th.  The\r\nnext transports from Italy went farther east.  Derna capitulated on the\r\n8th, but a heavy sea prevented the troops from landing until the 18th.\r\nGeneral Ameglio took Benghazi at the point of the bayonet on October\r\n19th.  Homs was occupied on the 21st.\r\n\r\nThe Turks and Arabs attempted to retake Tripoli on October 23d.  While\r\nthe Italian soldiers were in the trenches they were fired upon from\r\nbehind by Arabs who were supposed to be non-combatants.  Discovery of\r\nthe assailants was practically impossible, because many clothed\r\nthemselves like women and hid their faces by veils.  The Italians had\r\nto repress this move from the rear with ruthless severity.  They did\r\nwhat any other army would have done under the circumstances, for their\r\nsafety depended upon putting down the enemy that had arisen in their\r\nrear.  Failure to act quickly and severely would have encouraged a\r\nrevolution in the city and its suburbs.  Horror was excited throughout\r\nthe world by the highly coloured stories of this repression.  Details\r\nof Italian cruelty were emphasized.  No effort was made to explain\r\nimpartially the provocation which had led to this killing.  There was\r\nan unconscious motive in these stories to embarrass Italy in her\r\nattempt to build a colonial empire, just exactly as there had been in\r\nthe time of the Abyssinian War in 1896.  The American Consul at Tripoli\r\nhas assured me that the correspondents who were {250} guests at the\r\ntime of the Italian army did not give the facts as they were.\r\n\r\nThe French and English newspaper campaign against Italy was as violent\r\nas it had been against Austria in 1908, at the time of the first\r\nviolation of Ottoman territorial integrity.  Attempts were made to\r\ndenounce the high-handed act of piracy of which Italy had been guilty,\r\nand to poison the public mind against the Italian army.  It is\r\nsignificant to note this attitude of the press of the two countries,\r\nwhich are now so persuasively extending the olive branch to Italy.\r\nGreat Britain and France were alarmed over the menace to the\r\n\"equilibrium\" of the Mediterranean.  This is why they did not hesitate\r\nto denounce unsparingly the successful effort of Italy to follow in\r\ntheir own footsteps!  The tension between France and Italy was\r\nillustrated by the vehement newspaper protests against the Italian use\r\nof the right of search for contraband on French ships.  Italy was taken\r\nto task for acting in exactly the same way that France has since acted\r\nin arresting Dutch ships in August and September, 1914.\r\n\r\nThe attempt of October 23d failed, in spite of the conspiracy behind\r\nthe lines.  A second attempt on the 26th was equally unsuccessful.  On\r\nNovember 6th, the garrison of Tripoli started to take the offensive.\r\nBut progress beyond the suburbs of the city was found to be impossible.\r\n\r\nA decree annexing the African provinces of Turkey was approved by the\r\nItalian Parliament on November 5th.  The Italian \"adventure,\" as those\r\nwho looked upon Italy's aggression with unfriendly eyes {251} persisted\r\nin calling it, was now shown to be irrevocable.  Turkey's opportunity\r\nto compromise had passed.\r\n\r\nIn Tripoli, as well as in the other cities, it took the whole winter to\r\nmake the foothold on the coast secure.  From November 27th to March 3d,\r\nEnver bey made three attempts to retake Derna.  From November 28th to\r\nMarch 12th, six assaults of Turks and Arabs were made upon Benghazi.\r\nThe Italian positions at Homs were not secure until February 27th.\r\nItaly was practically on the defensive everywhere.\r\n\r\nHakki pasha found himself compelled to resign when the war was\r\ndeclared.  In fact, he considered himself fortunate not to be\r\nassassinated by army officers, who declared that he had been negligent\r\nto the point of treason in laying Turkey open to the possibility of\r\nbeing attacked where and when she was weakest.  Saïd pasha became Grand\r\nVizier--he had held the post six times under Abdul Hamid.  Five members\r\nof the former Cabinet, including Mahmud Shevket pasha, remained in\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe first appearance of Saïd pasha's Cabinet before Parliament is a\r\nscene that I shall never forget.  No pains had been spared to make it a\r\nbrilliant spectacle.  The Sultan was present during the reading of his\r\nspeech from the throne.  Everyone expected an important pronouncement.\r\nThe speech of Saïd pasha was typically Turkish.  Instead of announcing\r\nhow Turkey was to resist Italy, he gave it to be understood in vague\r\nlanguage that diplomacy was going to save the day once more, and that\r\nTurkey was secure because the preservation of her territorial integrity\r\nwas necessary for Europe.\r\n\r\n{252}\r\n\r\nThe action of Italy, however, had upset the calculations of the Young\r\nTurks in the game they were trying to play in European diplomacy.  It\r\nwas their dream--more than that, their belief--that Turkey held the\r\nbalance of power between the two great groups of European Powers.  They\r\nthought that the destinies of Europe were in their hands.  I heard\r\nMahmud Shevket pasha say once that \"the million bayonets of Turkey\r\nwould decide the fortunes of Europe.\"  Turkey was essentially mixed up\r\nin the European imbroglio.  But it was the absence of those million\r\nbayonets, of which Mahmud Shevket pasha boasted, that changed the\r\nfortunes of Europe.  The military weakness of the Ottoman Empire has\r\nbrought us to the present catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThe embarrassment of the Young Turks was that Italy belonged to the\r\nTriple Alliance, and that Germany, while professing deep and loyal\r\nfriendship, stood by and saw Turkey attacked by her ally, Italy, just\r\nas she had stood by in 1908, when the other partner of the Triple\r\nAlliance had annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Those who had based their\r\nhopes of Turkey's future upon the pan-Germanic movement had a bitter\r\nawakening.  In what sense could Wilhelm II be called \"the defender of\r\nIslam\"?\r\n\r\nI attended sessions of Parliament frequently during the five weeks\r\nbetween the outbreak of the war and the passing of the decree by which\r\nthe African possessions of Turkey were annexed to the kingdom of Italy.\r\nBefore this step had been taken by Italy, there was a possibility of\r\nsaving the situation.  But the Turks, instead of presenting a united\r\nfront to the {253} world, and finding ways and means of making a\r\nsuccessful resistance against Italy, wasted not only the precious month\r\nof October, when there was still a way out, but also the whole winter\r\nthat followed.  In November, the opposition in the House and Senate\r\nformed a new party which they called the \"Entente Liberale.\"  The\r\nprincipal discussions in Parliament were about whether the Hakki pasha\r\nCabinet should be tried for high treason, and whether the Chamber of\r\nDeputies could be prorogued by the Sultan without the consent of the\r\nSenate.  The opposition grew so rapidly that the Committee of Union and\r\nProgress induced the Sultan to dissolve Parliament on January 18, 1913.\r\n\r\nThe new elections were held at the end of March.  Throughout the Empire\r\nthey were a pure farce.  The functionaries of the Government saw to it\r\nthat only members of the Committee of Union and Progress were returned.\r\nWhile the Young Turks were playing their game of parties, anarchy was\r\nrife in different parts of the Empire.  The \"Interior Organization\" had\r\nbeen revived in Macedonia.  The Albanians, who had been left entirely\r\nout of the fold in the new elections, were determined to get redress.\r\nIn Arabia, the neutrality of Iman Yahia in the war with Italy was\r\npurchased only by the granting of complete autonomy.  It was the\r\nsurrender of the last vestige of Turkish authority in an important part\r\nof Arabia.  Saïd Idris, the other powerful chief in the Yemen, refused\r\nto accept autonomy, and continued to harass the Turkish army.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Union and Progress was not {254} allowed to enjoy long\r\nits fraudulent victory.  In the army an organization which called\r\nitself \"The Military League for the Defence of the Country\" was formed,\r\nand received so many adhesions that Mahmud Shevket pasha was compelled\r\nto leave the Ministry of War on July 10th, and Saïd pasha the Grand\r\nVizirate eight days later.  Ghazi Mukhtar pasha accepted the task of\r\nforming a new Cabinet.  The Unionist Parliament refused to listen to\r\nhis program.  So he secured from the Sultan a second prorogation of\r\nParliament on August 5th.  The weapon the Unionists had used was turned\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nWhile Turkey showed herself absolutely incapable of making any military\r\nmove to recover the invaded provinces or to punish the invader, Italy\r\nhad none the less a difficult problem to face.  A few Turkish officers\r\nhad succeeded in organizing among the Arabs of Tripoli and Benghazi a\r\ntroublesome resistance.  General Caneva went to Rome at the beginning\r\nof February, and told the Cabinet very plainly that it would take\r\nmonths to get a start in Africa, and years to complete the pacification\r\nof the new colonies, unless the Turks consented to withdraw the support\r\nof their military leadership and to cease their religious agitation.\r\n\r\nThe question was, how could Turkey be forced to recognize the\r\nannexation decree of November 5th?  The Italian fleet could not be kept\r\nindefinitely, at tremendous expense and monthly depreciation of the\r\nvalue of the ships, under steam.  The Turkish fleet did not come out to\r\ngive battle, so the Italians were immobilized at the mouth of the\r\nDardanelles.  Italian {255} commerce in the Black Sea and eastern\r\nMediterranean was at a standstill.  Upon Italian imports into Turkey\r\nhad been placed a duty of one hundred per cent.  Where, outside of\r\nTripoli, was the pressure to be exercised?\r\n\r\nPremier San Giuliano had promised before the war started that he would\r\nnot disturb political conditions in the Balkan peninsula.  The alliance\r\nwith Austria-Hungary made impossible operations in the Adriatic.  But\r\nit was clear that something must be done.  Public opinion in Italy had\r\nbeen getting very restless.  It did not seem to the Italians that the\r\nconsiderations of international diplomacy should stand in the way of\r\nfinishing the war.  Were they to burden themselves with heavy taxes in\r\norder to spare the feelings of the Great Powers?  Had Russia hesitated\r\nin the Caucasus?  Had Great Britain hesitated in Egypt?  Had Austria\r\nhesitated in Bosnia-Herzegovina?\r\n\r\nAs a sop to public opinion, and also as a feeler to see how the move\r\nwould be taken by the other Powers, the Cabinet decided upon direct\r\naction against Turkey.  The fleet appeared before Beirut on February\r\n24th, and sank two Turkish warships in the harbour.  It was not exactly\r\na bombardment of the city, but many shells did fall on the buildings\r\nand on the streets near the quay.  Neither Turkey nor Europe paid much\r\nattention to this demonstration.  In April, Italy had come to the point\r\nwhere she felt that she must cast all scruples to the winds.  A direct\r\nattack upon Turkey was decided.  Italy, at this writing the only\r\nneutral among the Great Powers of Europe, took the action {256} which\r\nbrought Balkan ambitions to a ferment, and caused the kindling of the\r\nEuropean conflagration.  Her declaration of war on Turkey and the\r\nannexation of Tripoli inevitably led to this.  On April 18th Admiral\r\nViala bombarded the forts of Kum Kale at the Dardanelles, and on the\r\nsame day the port of Vathy in Samos.  Four days later Italian marines\r\ndisembarked on the island of Stampali.  On May 4th, Rhodes was invaded,\r\na battle occurred in the streets of the town, and the Turks withdrew to\r\nthe interior of the island.  They were pursued, and surrendered on the\r\n17th.  Ten other islands at the mouth of the Ægean Sea were occupied.\r\n\r\nA demonstration at Patmos for union with Greece was vigorously\r\nrepressed.  Italy protested her good faith in regard to the islands.\r\nBut the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire, arrested at San Stefano in\r\n1878, had begun again.\r\n\r\nTurkey responded to the bombardment of Kum Kale by closing the\r\nDardanelles, and to the occupation of Rhodes by attempting to expel\r\nfrom Turkey all Italian residents.  The expulsion decree, however, was\r\ncarried out with great humanity and consideration by the Turks.  During\r\nthe Italian War and also the Balkan War, Turkish treatment of subjects\r\nof hostile states living in Ottoman territory was highly praiseworthy.\r\nThe Christian nations of Europe would today do well to follow their\r\nexample!\r\n\r\nThe closing of the straits lasted for a month.  It disturbed all\r\nEurope.  Never before has the question of the straits been shown to be\r\nso vital to the world.  From April 18th to May 18th, over two hundred\r\n{257} merchant vessels of all nations were immobilized in\r\nConstantinople.  It was a sight to be witness of once in a lifetime.\r\nFor these ships were not lost in a maze of basins, docks, and piers.\r\nThey lay in the stream of the Bosphorus and at the entrance to the Sea\r\nof Marmora.  You could count them all from the Galata Tower.  The loss\r\nto shipping was tremendous.  Southern Russia is the bread basket of\r\nEurope.  No European resident could remain unaffected by a closing of\r\nthe only means of egress for these billions of bushels of wheat.  Angry\r\nprotests were in vain.  Turkey reopened the straits only when assurance\r\nhad been given to her that the attack of the Italian fleet would not be\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nLittle had been gained by Italy as far as hastening peace was\r\nconcerned.  She had done all that she could.  Turkey still remained\r\npassive and unresisting, because she knew well that any vital action,\r\nsuch as the bombardment of Salonika or Smyrna, or the invasion of\r\nEuropean Turkey by way of Albania or Macedonia, would bring on a\r\ngeneral European war.  Italy could not take this responsibility before\r\nhistory.  So for months longer it remained a war without battles.  Many\r\nItalian warships had not fired a single shot.\r\n\r\nDuring May, June, and July, the Italians pushed on painfully to the\r\ninterior of Tripoli.  There was no other way.  In August, the Turkish\r\nresistance on the side of Tunis was finished.  In September, a\r\ndesperate attack of Enver bey against Derna was repulsed.  The Italian\r\nforces were in a much better position than before.  But the attacks of\r\nthe Arabs {258} were of such a character that they could not be\r\nsuppressed by overwhelming numbers of trained men that the Italians\r\ncould muster.  It was a guerilla warfare with the oases of the desert\r\nas the background.  The Italians felt that the Arabs, if left to\r\nthemselves, would soon tire of the conflict.  For they were, after all,\r\ntraders, and were dependent upon the outlets for their caravan trade\r\nwhich was now completely in the hands of Italians.  It was the mere\r\nhandful of Turkish troops and Turkish officers who kept the Arabs\r\nstirred up to fight.\r\n\r\nAs early as June, Italian and Turkish representatives met informally at\r\nOuchy on Lac Leman to discuss bases for a solution of the conflict\r\nwhich had degenerated into an odd _impasse_.  Italy was anxious to\r\nconclude peace for several reasons.  Her commerce was suffering.  Her\r\nwarships needed the drydock badly.  While Turkey could no longer\r\nprevent the conquest of Tripoli and Benghazi, the absence of Turkish\r\ndirection in keeping the tribesmen of the interior stirred up, and the\r\ncessation of the propaganda against the Italian occupation on the\r\nground of religion, would help greatly in the pacification of the\r\nprovinces.  Since the Albanian revolution had assumed alarming\r\nproportions, Turkey also became anxious for peace.  She was uncertain\r\nof Italy's attitude in case of an outbreak in the Balkans.\r\nUnofficially, Italy had let it be known that there was a limit to\r\npatience, and that the development of a hostile attitude by the Balkan\r\nStates against Turkey would find her, in spite of Europe, in alliance\r\nwith them against her.  In reality, however, the Italian {259}\r\nministers at the Balkan courts had all along done their best to keep\r\nGreece and Bulgaria from being carried away by the temptation to take\r\nadvantage of the situation.  This had been especially true in April and\r\nMay, during the period of Italian activity in the Ægean.\r\n\r\nTurkey knew perfectly well, before the _pourparlers_ at Ouchy, what\r\nwere the Italian terms.  In March, when the five other Powers had\r\noffered to mediate, Italy had laid down the following points: tacit\r\nrecognition of the Italian conquest and withdrawal of the Turkish army\r\nfrom Africa; recognition by the Powers, if not by Turkey, of the decree\r\nof annexation.  Italy promised, if this were done, to recognize the\r\nSultan as Khalif in the African provinces (this meant purely religious\r\nsovereignty); to respect the religious liberty and customs of the\r\nMoslem populations; to accord an amnesty to the Arabs; to guarantee to\r\nthe Ottoman Public Debt the obligations for which the customs-duties of\r\nTripoli had been mortgaged; to buy the properties owned by the Ottoman\r\nGovernment; to guarantee, in accord with the other Powers, the\r\n(future!) \"integrity of the Ottoman Empire.\"  Turkey had refused these\r\nterms, in spite of the pressure of the Powers at the Sublime Porte.\r\nThen followed the loss of Rhodes and the other islands.\r\n\r\nThe first _pourparlers_ at Ouchy had been interrupted by the fall of\r\nSaïd pasha.  They were resumed on August 12th by duly accredited\r\ndelegates.  After six weeks an accord was prepared, and sent to\r\nConstantinople.  The ministry, although facing a war with the Balkan\r\nStates, tried to prolong the {260} negotiations.  Italy then addressed\r\nan ultimatum on October 12th.  The Sublime Porte was doing its best to\r\nprevent war with the Balkan States.  Italy was determined now to go to\r\nany length to wring peace from her stubborn opponent.  For the Balkan\r\nstorm was breaking, and she wanted to get her ambassador back to\r\nConstantinople to take part in the councils of the Great Powers.  The\r\ncontinuance of a state of war with Turkey was never more clearly\r\nagainst her interests.  When the ultimatum arrived, Turkey yielded.\r\nThe preliminaries of Ouchy were signed on October 15th.\r\n\r\nThere were two distinct parts to the Treaty of Lausanne, as it is\r\ngenerally called.  In order to save the pride of Turkey, nothing was\r\nsaid in the text of the treaty about a cession of territory.  Turkey\r\nwas not asked to recognize the Italian conquest.  The unofficial\r\nportion of the treaty consisted of a _firman_, granting complete\r\nautonomy to the African _vilayet_, and appointing a personal religious\r\nrepresentative of the Khalif, with functions purely nominal; and the\r\npromise of amnesty and good administration to the Ægean Islands.\r\n\r\nThe text of the treaty provided for the cessation of hostilities; the\r\nwithdrawal of the Turkish army from Tripoli and Benghazi and the\r\nwithdrawal of the Italian army from the islands of the Ægean; the\r\nresumption of commercial and diplomatic relations; and the assumption\r\nby Italy of Tripoli's share of the Ottoman Public Debt.\r\n\r\nItaly had no intention of fulfilling the spirit of the second clause of\r\nthis treaty, which was that the {261} islands occupied by her be\r\nrestored to Turkey.  The text of the treaty provided that the recall of\r\nthe Italian troops be subordinated to the recall of the Turkish troops\r\nfrom Tripoli.  It was easy enough to quibble at a later time about the\r\nmeaning of \"Turkish.\"  As long as there was opposition to the Italian\r\npacification, the opponents could be called Turkish.  Italy said that\r\nthe holding of the Dodecanese was a guarantee of Turkish good faith in\r\npreventing the continuance secretly of armed opposition to her\r\nsubjugation of the new African colonies.  As long as an Arab held the\r\nfield against the Italian army, it could still be claimed that Turkey\r\nhad not fulfilled her side of the promise in Article 2.  At the moment,\r\nTurkey was quite willing to see the Italians stay in the southern\r\nislands of the Ægean.  For otherwise they would have inevitably fallen\r\ninto the hands of the Greeks when the Balkan War broke out.\r\n\r\nSince the Treaty of Lausanne was signed, the Italians have remained in\r\nthe Dodecanese.  Not only that, but they have used their position in\r\nRhodes to begin a propaganda of Italian economic influence in\r\nsouth-western Asia Minor.  Before the present European war, Italy might\r\nhave found herself compelled to relinquish her hold on these islands.\r\nBut now her advantageous neutrality has put into her hands the cards by\r\nwhich she can secure the acquiescence of Europe to the annexation of\r\nRhodes.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of indignation in Turkey against Italy at the beginning of\r\nthe war was even more vehement than that against Austria-Hungary when\r\nshe had annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1908.  {262} Hussein Djahid bey,\r\nin the _Tanine_, wrote an editorial, in which he said: \"Never shall we\r\nhave any dealings with the Italians in the future.  Never shall a ship\r\nbearing their flag find trade at an Ottoman port.  And we shall teach\r\nour children, and tell them to teach their children, the reasons for\r\nthe undying hatred between Osmanli and Italian as long as history\r\nlasts.\"  Having read the same sort of a thing in 1908, I was interested\r\nin seeing just how long the hatred would last.  Just a year from the\r\nday war was declared, and this editorial appeared, the Italian\r\nambassador returned on a warship to Constantinople, the Italian post\r\noffices opened, and all my Italian friends began to reappear.  This is\r\ntold here to illustrate the fact that cannot be too strongly\r\nemphasized: _there is no public opinion in Turkey_.\r\n\r\nThe chief importance of the year of \"the war that was no war\" is not in\r\nthe loss of Tripoli.  It is in the fact that the integrity of the\r\nOttoman Empire, secure since 1878, had been attacked _by violence_.\r\nThe example given by Italy was to be followed by the Balkan States.\r\nWhat Europe had feared had come.  This war was the prelude to Europe in\r\narms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{263}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE WAR BETWEEN THE BALKAN STATES AND TURKEY\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1911 there had been a perceptible drawing together of\r\nthe Balkan States in the effort to find a common ground for an\r\noffensive alliance against Turkey.  The path of union was very\r\ndifficult for the diplomats of the Balkan States to follow.  It was\r\nclear to them in principle that they would never be able to oppose the\r\npolicy of the Young Turks separately.  They were not even sure whether\r\ntheir united armies could triumph over the large forces which the\r\nOttoman Empire was able to put in the field, and which were reputed to\r\nbe well trained and disciplined.  This reputation was sustained by the\r\nunanimous opinion of the military _attachés_ of the Great Powers at\r\nConstantinople.  And then, there were the mutual antipathies to be\r\nhealed, and the problem of the terrible rivalry in Macedonia, of which\r\nwe have spoken before, to be solved.  Most formidable of all, was the\r\nuncertainty as to the benefit to the different Balkan nations of a\r\nsuccessful war against Turkey.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to explain here all the diplomatic {264} steps leading\r\nup to the Balkan alliance against Turkey.  They have been set forth,\r\nwith much divergency of opinion, by a number of writers who were in\r\nintimate touch with the diplomatic circles of the Balkan capitals\r\nduring the years immediately preceding the formation of the alliance.\r\nWe must confine ourselves to a statement of the general causes which\r\ninduced the Balkan States, against the better judgment of many of their\r\nwisest leaders, to form the alliance, and to declare war upon Turkey.\r\nBoth Bulgaria and Greece had sentimental reasons; the terrible\r\npersecution of the Christians of their own race in Macedonia seemed\r\ncause enough for war.  But while Bulgaria had long held the thesis of\r\nMacedonian autonomy, which was sustained by the Bulgarian Macedonians\r\nthemselves, Greece was afraid that the creation of such a _régime_\r\nwould in the end prove an irrevocable blow to Hellenistic aspirations.\r\nIt was well known to the Greeks that the population of Macedonia was\r\nnot only largely Bulgarian, but aggressively so, and that its sense of\r\nnationality had been intelligently and skilfully awakened and fostered\r\nby the educational propaganda.  Above all things Hellenism feared the\r\nBulgarian schools.  Under an autonomous _régime_ their influence could\r\nnot be combated.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of the Balkan alliance was really in the hands of\r\nGreece.  For it was recognized that no matter how large and powerful an\r\narmy Bulgaria and Servia could raise, the co-operation of the Greek\r\nnavy, which would prevent the use of the Ægean ports of the Macedonian\r\nlittoral for disembarking {265} troops from Asia, was absolutely\r\nessential to success.  In spite of their fears for the future of\r\nMacedonia, the Greeks were converted to the idea of an alliance with\r\nthe Slavic Balkan States to destroy the power of Turkey by the\r\ncontinual bullying of the Young Turks over Crete, and by the economic\r\ndisasters from the boycott.  It is not too much to say that the\r\nattitude of the Young Turks towards the Cretan questions, and their\r\ninstitution of the boycott, were two factors directly responsible for\r\nthe downfall of the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe visit of three hundred Bulgarian students to Athens in Easter week,\r\n1911, should have been a warning to Turkey of the danger which attended\r\nher policy of goading the Greeks to desperation.  I was present on the\r\nAcropolis at the memorable reception given by the students of Athens to\r\ntheir guests from the University of Sofia, and remember well the\r\npeculiar political significance of the speeches of welcome addressed to\r\nthem there.  Later in the same year, Greece followed the example of the\r\nother Balkan States in sending her Crown Prince to Sofia to join in the\r\nfestivities attendant upon the coming of age of Crown Prince Boris.\r\n\r\nBulgaria was drawn into the Balkan alliance, and reluctantly compelled\r\nto abandon the policy of Macedonian autonomy, by the attitude of the\r\nYoung Turks toward Macedonians.  The settlement of immigrants from\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, and the conscription for the Turkish army, led\r\nto reprisals on the part of Bulgarian bands.  These were followed by\r\nmassacres at Ishtib and elsewhere.  In the {266} first week of August,\r\n1912, the massacre of Kotchana was for Bulgaria the last straw on the\r\ncamel's back.  I was in Sofia at the end of August when the national\r\ncongress, called together wholly without the Government's co-operation,\r\ndeclared that war was a necessity.  Seated one evening in the public\r\ngarden at a café--if I remember rightly it was the 1st of September--I\r\nheard from the lips of one of the influential delegates at this\r\ncongress that public opinion in Bulgaria was so wholly determined to\r\nforce war, that the King and the Cabinet would have to yield.\r\n\r\nIn Servia and Montenegro, it had long been recognized that any\r\nopportunity to unite with Bulgaria and Greece to bring pressure to bear\r\nupon Turkey could not but be beneficial to these two kingdoms.  There\r\nwas the _sandjak_ of Novi Bazar to be divided between Montenegro and\r\nServia.  There was the possibility of an outlet to the Adriatic.  So\r\nfar as Macedonia was concerned, if we believe that she was honest and\r\nsincere in the treaty of partition with Bulgaria, Servia was quite\r\ncontent with the idea of a possible annexation of Old Servia, and the\r\nopportunity to drive back the Moslem Albanians, who had been\r\nestablished on her frontiers under the Young Turk _régime_, and were\r\nruthlessly destroying Slavs wherever they got the opportunity.\r\n\r\nOne does not have any hesitation in declaring that the political\r\nleaders in power in the Balkan States at first hoped to avoid a war\r\nwith Turkey.  That they did not succeed in doing so was due to the\r\npressure of public sentiment upon them.  This public sentiment forced\r\nthem to action.  Every Balkan {267} Cabinet would have fallen had the\r\nministries remained advocates of peace.  Over against the fear of the\r\nTurkish army, which (let me say it emphatically) was very strong among\r\nthe military authorities in each of the Balkan States, was the feeling\r\nthat the time was very favourable to act, and that chances of success\r\nin a common war against Turkey were greater in the autumn of 1912 than\r\nthey would be later; for the Young Turks were spending tremendous sums\r\nof money on army reorganization.  At that moment, they were coming to\r\nthe end of a demoralizing war with Italy, and the Macedonian army had\r\nsuffered greatly during the summer by the Albanian uprising.\r\n\r\nEarly in September, Bulgaria, Servia, Greece, and Montenegro decided\r\nthat peace could be preserved only by the actual application, under\r\nsufficient guarantees, of sweeping reforms in Macedonia.  They appealed\r\nto the Powers to sustain them in demanding for Macedonia a provincial\r\nassembly, a militia recruited within the limits of the province, and a\r\nChristian Governor.  The Great Powers, as usual, tried to carry water\r\non both shoulders.  Blind to the fact that inaction and vague promises\r\nwould no longer keep in check the neighbours of Turkey, they urged the\r\nBalkan States to refrain from \"being insistent,\" and pointed out to\r\nTurkey the \"advisability\" of making concessions.  The Turks did not\r\nbelieve in the reality of the union of the Balkan States.  They could\r\nnot conceive upon what grounds their neighbours had succeeded in\r\nforming an alliance.  Neither the Balkan States nor Turkey had {268}\r\nany respect for the threats or promises or offers of assistance of the\r\nPowers.\r\n\r\nIn order to convince the Balkan States that they had better think twice\r\nbefore making a direct ultimatum, the Turks organized autumn manoeuvres\r\nnorth of Adrianople, in which fifty thousand of the _élite_ army corps\r\nwere to take part.  The answer of the Balkan States was an order for\r\ngeneral mobilization issued simultaneously in the four capitals.  This\r\nwas on September 30th.  The next day Turkey began to mobilize.  All the\r\nGreek ships in the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles were seized.\r\nMunitions of war, disembarked at Salonika for Servia, were confiscated.\r\nIt was not until then that it began to dawn upon Turkey and her\r\nsponsors, the Great Powers, that the Balkan States meant business.  The\r\nquestions of reforms in Macedonia had been so long the prerogative of\r\nthe Powers that they did not realize that the moment had come when the\r\nlittle Balkan States, whom they called \"troublesome,\" were no longer\r\ngoing to be put off with promises.  The absolute failure of concerted\r\nEuropean diplomacy to accomplish anything in the Ottoman Empire was\r\ndemonstrated from the results in Macedonia, and also in Crete.\r\n\r\nSo the Balkan States were not in the proper frame of mind to receive\r\nthe joint note on the _status quo_, which will remain famous in the\r\nannals of European diplomacy as a demonstration of the futility of\r\nconcerted diplomatic action, when there is no genuine unity behind it.\r\nOn the morning of October 8th, the ministers of Russia and Austria,\r\nacting in the {269} name of the six \"Great Powers,\" handed in at Sofia,\r\nAthens, Belgrade, and Cettinje, the following note:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Russian and Austro-Hungarian Governments declare to the Balkan\r\nStates:\r\n\r\n\"1. That the Powers condemn energetically every measure capable of\r\nleading to a rupture of peace;\r\n\r\n\"2. That, supporting themselves on Article 23 of the Treaty of Berlin,\r\nthey will take in hand, in the interest of the populations, the\r\nrealization of the reforms in the administration of European Turkey, on\r\nthe understanding that these reforms will not diminish the sovereignty\r\nof His Imperial Majesty the Sultan and the territorial integrity of the\r\nOttoman Empire; this declaration reserves, also, the liberty of the\r\nPowers for the collective and ulterior study of the reforms;\r\n\r\n\"3. That if, in spite of this note, war does break out between the\r\nBalkan States and the Ottoman Empire, they will not admit, at the end\r\nof the conflict, any modification in the territorial _status quo_ in\r\nEuropean Turkey.\r\n\r\n\"The Powers will make collectively to the Sublime Porte the steps which\r\nthe preceding declaration makes necessary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shades of San Stefano, Berlin, Cyprus, and Egypt, Armenian\r\nmassacres, Mitylene and Mürszteg, Bagdad railway, Bosnia-Herzegovina,\r\nTripoli, and Rhodes, haunted this declaration, and made it impotent,\r\nhonest effort though it was to preserve the peace of Europe.  It was\r\nthirty-six years too late.\r\n\r\nFor, one hour after it was delivered, the _chargé {270} d'affaires_ of\r\nthe Montenegrin legation at Constantinople, evidently as a result of an\r\nanticipation of a joint note from the Powers, left at the Sublime Porte\r\nthe following memorable declaration of war:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In conformity with the authorization of King Nicholas, I have the\r\nhonour of informing you that I shall leave Constantinople to-day.  The\r\nGovernment of Montenegro breaks off all relations with the Ottoman\r\nEmpire, leaving to the fortunes of arms of the Montenegrins the\r\nrecognition of their rights and of the rights scorned through centuries\r\nof their brothers of the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\n\"I leave Constantinople.\r\n\r\n\"The royal government will give to the Ottoman representative at\r\nCettinje his passports.\r\n\r\n\"October 8, 1912.  PLAMENATZ.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere could no longer be any doubt of the trend of things.  Inevitable\r\nresult, this declaration of war, of the action of Italy one year\r\nbefore, just as the action of Italy harked back to Russian action in\r\nthe Caucasus, British action in Egypt, Austrian action in\r\nBosnia-Herzegovina, and French action in Morocco.  Inevitable\r\nprecursor, this declaration of war, of the European catastrophe of\r\n1914.  Who, then, is presumptuous enough to maintain that the cause is\r\nsimple, and the blame all at one door?  Europe is reaping in blood-lust\r\nwhat _all_ the \"Great Powers\" have sown in land-lust.\r\n\r\nThe chancelleries made strenuous efforts to nullify what their inspired\r\norgans called the \"blunder,\" or the \"hasty and inconsiderate action,\"\r\nof King Nicholas.  There was feverish activity in Constantinople, {271}\r\nand a continual exchange of conferences between the embassies and the\r\nSublime Porte.  The ambassadors gravely handed in a common note, in\r\nwhich they offered to avert war by taking in hand themselves the\r\nlong-delayed reforms.  Had they forgotten the institution of the\r\n_gendarmerie_ in 1903, and Hussein Hilmi pasha at Salonika?\r\n\r\nOn this same day, the Montenegrin ex-minister at Constantinople, whose\r\ndeclaration of war had been so theatrical, was reported as having said\r\nat Bukarest on his way home, \"Montenegro wants territorial\r\naggrandizements, and will not give back whatever conquests she makes.\r\nWe do not fear to cross the will of the Great Powers, for they do not\r\nworry us.\"  These words express exactly the sentiments of the other\r\nallies, both as regards their possible conquests and their attitude\r\ntowards the _dictum_ of the Powers.\r\n\r\nEvents moved rapidly during the next ten days.  On October 13th, the\r\nBalkan States responded to the Russo-Austrian note, thanking the Powers\r\nfor their generous offices, but declaring that they had come to the end\r\nof their patience in the matter of Turkish promises for Macedonian\r\nreform, and were going to request of the Ottoman Government that it\r\naccord \"without delay the reforms that have been demanded, and that it\r\npromise to apply them in six months, with the help of the Great Powers,\r\nand of the Balkan States whose interests are involved.\"  This response\r\nwas not only a refusal of mediation.  It was an assertion, as the last\r\nwords show, that the time had come when the Balkan States felt strong\r\n{272} enough to claim a part in the management of their own affairs.\r\n\r\nActing in accordance with this notification to the Powers, on October\r\n14th, Servia, Greece, and Bulgaria demanded of Turkey the autonomy of\r\nthe European provinces, under Christian governors; the occupation of\r\nthe provinces by the allied armies while the reforms were being\r\napplied; the payment of an indemnity for the expenses of mobilization;\r\nthe immediate demobilization of Turkey; and the promise that the\r\nreforms would be effected within six months.  The demand was in the\r\ncharacter of an ultimatum, and forty-eight hours were given for a\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\nIt was now evident that unless the Powers could compel the Balkan\r\nStates to withdraw this sweeping claim, war would be inevitable.  For\r\nno independent state could accept such a demand, and retain its\r\nself-respect.  The representatives of Turkey at Belgrade and Athens\r\nwere quite right in refusing to receive the note and transmit it to\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nThe Sublime porte did not answer directly the ultimatum of the allies.\r\nAn effort was made to anticipate the Balkan claims, and get the Powers\r\nto intervene, by reviving the law of reform for the _vilayets_, which\r\nprovided for the organization of communes and schools, the building of\r\nroads, and the limitation of military service to the _vilayet_ or\r\nrecruitment.  But the fact that this law had been on the statute books\r\nsince 1880, and had remained throughout the Empire a dead letter, gave\r\nlittle hope that it would be seriously applied now.\r\n\r\n{273}\r\n\r\nOn October 15th, fighting began on the Serbo-Turkish frontier.  The war\r\nhad already brought about Turkish reverses at the hands of the\r\nMontenegrins.  Greece threw an additional defiance in the face of\r\nTurkey by admitting the Cretan deputies to the Greek legislative\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nTo gain time, for she was unprepared, and her mobilization progressing\r\nvery slowly, Turkey made desperate efforts to delay the declaration of\r\nwar by offering to treat at Sofia, on the basis of a cessation of\r\nMoslem immigration into Macedonia, and the suspension of enrolment of\r\nChristians in Moslem regiments.  These points, as we have already\r\nshown, were the two principal reasons why the Bulgarians of Macedonia\r\nhad changed their policy from autonomy to independence.  But Bulgaria,\r\nfeeling that cause for hesitation over a war of liberation had been\r\nremoved by her secret partition treaty with Servia, remained obdurate.\r\n\r\nThen the Turkish diplomats turned their attention to Athens, and tried\r\nto detach the Greeks from the alliance by agreeing to recognize the\r\nannexation of Crete to Greece, and promising an autonomous government\r\nfor some of the Ægean Islands.  This failed.  But, to the very last,\r\nthe Turks believed that Greece might stay out of the war.  For this\r\nreason her representative at Athens was instructed to do all in his\r\npower to remain at his post, even if war were declared by the Sublime\r\nPorte on Bulgaria and Servia.\r\n\r\nPeace was hurriedly concluded with Italy at Ouchy on October 15th.  On\r\nthe 16th, when the {274} forty-eight hours of the ultimatum had\r\nexpired, and there was no answer from Turkey, every one expected a\r\ndeclaration of war from the allies.  None came.  On the 18th, to\r\npreserve her dignity, Turkey saw that she must be the one to act.  It\r\nwas no longer possible to wait until the allies were \"good and ready\"!\r\nShe declared war on Bulgaria and Servia.  Greece waited till afternoon\r\nto receive a similar declaration.  None came.  So Greece declared war\r\non Turkey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST PERIOD OF THE WAR\r\n\r\nWhile the diplomats were still agitating and blustering, while Turkey\r\nwas procrastinating and trying to put off the evil day, and while the\r\nlarger Balkan States were quietly completing their mobilization,\r\nMontenegro entered into action.  On October 9th, the day following her\r\ndeclaration of war, the Montenegrins entered the _sandjak_ of Novi\r\nBazar, and surrounded the frontier fortress of Berana.  This was\r\ncaptured after six days of fighting.  On the same day, Biepolje fell.\r\nNearly one thousand prisoners, fourteen cannon, and a large number of\r\nrifles and stores were captured by the Montenegrins.  In the meantime,\r\ntwo other Montenegrin columns had marched southward, reached San\r\nGiovanni di Medua, at the mouth of the Boyana, and cut Scutari off from\r\nthe sea.  Scutari was invested, but the Montenegrins, who had been able\r\nto put into the field scarcely more than thirty thousand men, found\r\nthemselves mobilized for the entire winter.  The {275} great fortress\r\nof Tarabosh, a high mountain, towering over the town of Scutari and the\r\nlower end of the lake, was too strong for their forces and for their\r\nartillery.  Inside the city of Scutari, it was the Albanians fighting\r\nfor their national life, and not the Turks, who organized and\r\nmaintained the splendid and protracted resistance.\r\n\r\nThe mobilization in the other Balkan States was not completed until the\r\n18th, when the declaration of war was made on both sides.\r\n\r\nMost important of the foes of Turkey were the Bulgarians, whose\r\nmilitary organization had for some years been attracting the admiration\r\nof all who had been privileged to see their manoeuvres and to visit\r\ntheir casernes.  Bulgaria had been carefully and secretly preparing her\r\nmobilization long before the crisis became acute.  I had the privilege\r\nof travelling in Bulgaria during the last two weeks of July, and of\r\nspending the month of August along the frontier between Thrace and\r\nBulgaria.  Everywhere one could see the accumulation of the soldiers of\r\nthe standing army already on war footing, and of military stores, at a\r\nnumber of different places.  During August and September, every detail\r\nof the mobilization had been carefully arranged.  When war was\r\ndeclared, Bulgaria had four armies with a total effective of over three\r\nhundred thousand.  Three of them were quickly massed on the frontier,\r\nfully equipped.  No army has ever entered the field under better\r\nauspices.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the declaration of war, the Czar Ferdinand issued a\r\nproclamation to his troops which {276} clearly defined the issue.  It\r\nwas to be a war of liberation, a crusade, undertaken to free the\r\nbrothers of blood and faith from the yoke of Moslem oppression.  In\r\nsumming up, the Czar said: \"In this struggle of the Cross against the\r\nCrescent, of liberty against tyranny, we shall have the sympathy of all\r\nthose who love justice and progress.\"  At the time, bitter criticism\r\nwas directed against the Czar for having used words which brought out\r\nso sharply the religious issue.  The proclamation of a _crusade_ could\r\nbring forth on the other side the response of a _djehad_ (holy war).\r\nThis, above all things, was what the European Powers wished to avoid;\r\nfor they feared not only that it would make the war more bitter and\r\nmore cruel between the opponents in the field, but that it would awaken\r\na wave of fanaticism among the Moslems living under European control in\r\nAsia and in Africa.  How many lessons will it need to teach Europe that\r\nthe political menace of Pan-Islamism is a phantom, a myth!\r\n\r\nAccording to the plan adopted by the allied States, the offensive\r\nmovement in Thrace, in which the bulk of the Turkish army would be met,\r\nwas to be undertaken solely by Bulgaria.  Only a Bulgarian army of\r\nsecondary importance was to enter eastern Macedonia, to protect the\r\nflank of the main Bulgarian army from a sudden eastward march of the\r\nTurkish Macedonian army.  Its objective point, though not actually\r\nagreed upon, was to be Serres.\r\n\r\nThe rôle of Servia and Greece, who in the general mobilization were\r\nexpected to put about one hundred and fifty thousand troops each into\r\nthe field, was {277} to keep in check the Turkish army in Macedonia,\r\nand to prevent Albanian reinforcements from reaching the Turkish army\r\nin Thrace.  In addition to this, Servia and Montenegro were expected to\r\nprevent the possible surprise of Austrian interference, while the fleet\r\nof Greece would perform the absolutely necessary service of preventing\r\nthe passage of Turkish forces from Asia Minor to a Macedonian port.\r\n\r\nThe allies expected a bitter struggle and, in Macedonia and Thrace at\r\nleast, the successful opposition of a Turkish offensive, rather than\r\nthe destruction of the Turkish armies.\r\n\r\nThe mobilization in Turkey was described by many newspaper men who had\r\ncome to Constantinople for the war in the most glowing terms.  The\r\nefforts of Mahmud Shevket pasha to prepare the Turkish army for war\r\nwere declared to be bearing splendid fruits in the first days of the\r\nmobilization.  Wholly inaccurate accounts were written of the wonderful\r\nenthusiasm of the Turkish people for the war.  Naturally, what even the\r\nresidents of Constantinople saw at the beginning was the best foot\r\nfront.  We knew that tremendous sums had been expended for four years\r\nin bringing the army up to a footing of efficiency.  We had seen with\r\nour own eyes the brilliant manoeuvres on the anniversary of the\r\nSultan's accession in May, and on the anniversary of the Constitution\r\nin July.  The work accomplished by the German mission had cast its\r\nspell over us.  We saw what we were expecting to see during the first\r\ndays of the mobilization.  The \"snap {278} judgments\" of special\r\ncorrespondents have little value, other than freshness and _naïveté_,\r\nexcept to readers even less informed than they are.  But the East is a\r\nsphinx even to those who live there.  After you have figured out, from\r\nwhat you call your \"experience,\" what _ought_ to happen, the chances\r\nare even that just the opposite comes true.  In spite of the misgivings\r\nwhich had been awakened by a trip into the interior of Asia Minor, as\r\nfar as Konia, during the third week of September, I believed that the\r\nTurkish army was going to give a good account of itself against the\r\nBulgarians, whose spirit and whose organization I had had opportunity\r\nto see and admire during that very summer.\r\n\r\nEvery one was mistaken.  There were large bodies of splendidly trained\r\nand well-equipped troops in Thrace.  Spick and span regiments did come\r\nover from garrison towns in Asia.  We saw them fill the trains at\r\nStambul and at San Stefano.  But we over-estimated their number.  The\r\ntruth of the matter is that the _trained_ and _well-equipped_ forces of\r\nthe Thracian army, officered by capable men, did not amount to more\r\nthan eighty thousand.  In retrospect, after going over carefully the\r\nposition of the forces which met the Bulgarians, I feel that these\r\nfigures can be pretty accurately established.  But even these eighty\r\nthousand soldiers of the _nizam_ (active army) could have done wonders\r\nin the Thracian campaign, if they had been allowed to go ahead to meet\r\nthe Bulgarians, and to form the first line of battle.  But this was not\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nThere are three time-honoured principles that {279} cannot afford to be\r\nneglected at the beginning of a campaign.  The army used for _initial_\r\noffensive action against the enemy should be composed _wholly_ of\r\nsoldiers in active service.  The army should be concentrated to meet\r\nthe attack, or to attack one opposing army first, leaving the others\r\nuntil later.  Armies must be kept mobile, and not allow themselves to\r\nbe trapped in fortresses.  The fortresses in the portions of territory\r\nwhich may have to be abandoned temporarily to the invasion of the enemy\r\nmay easily be overstocked with defenders, but never with provisions and\r\nmunitions of war.  In spite of the instructions of von der Goltz pasha,\r\nthe Turks showed no regard for the first two, at least, of these\r\nelementary principles.  The mobile army in Macedonia, outside of the\r\nfortresses, was not recalled to Thrace, and _redifs_ (reservists) were\r\nmixed with _nizams_ (actives) in the first line of battle.  The neglect\r\nof these principles was the direct cause of the Turkish disasters.\r\n\r\nAfter the _nizams_, most of whom were already in Thrace, came the\r\n_redifs_ from Asia Minor.  They arrived at Constantinople and at San\r\nStefano in huge numbers, and without equipment.  I saw many of them\r\nwith their feet bound in rags.  There were no tents over them or other\r\nshelter; there was no proper field equipment for them, and, even while\r\nthey were patiently waiting for days to be forwarded to the front, they\r\nlacked (within sight of the minarets of Stambul!) bread to eat, shoes\r\nfor their feet, and blankets to cover them at night.  More than that,\r\namong them were many thousands who did {280} not know how to use the\r\nrifles that were given to them, and who had not even a rudimentary\r\nmilitary education.  In defensive warfare, as they proved at Adrianople\r\nand at Tchatalja, they could fight like lions.  But for an offensive\r\nmovement in the field the great majority of the _redifs_ were worse\r\nthan useless.\r\n\r\nThe Turks were absolutely sure of victory.  The press of the capital,\r\non the day that war was declared, stated that the army of Thrace was\r\ncomposed of four hundred thousand soldiers, and that it was the\r\nintention to march direct to Sofia.  Turkish officers of my\r\nacquaintance told me that they were all taking their dress uniforms in\r\ntheir baggage for this triumphal entry into Sofia, and that the\r\ninvasion of Bulgaria would commence immediately.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of October, the Bulgarian army appeared in force at Mustafa\r\nPasha, the first railway station after passing the Turkish frontier on\r\nthe line from Sofia to Constantinople, and about eighteen miles\r\nnorth-west of Adrianople.  It was the announced intention of the\r\nBulgarians to attack immediately the fortress of Adrianople, whose\r\ncannon commanded the sole railway line from Bulgaria into Thrace.  Two\r\nof the Bulgarian armies were directed upon Adrianople, and the third\r\narmy under General Dimitrieff received similar orders.  In Bulgaria, as\r\nwell as in Turkey, every one expected to see an attack upon Adrianople.\r\nHad not General Savoff declared openly that he would sacrifice fifty\r\nthousand men, if necessary, as the Japanese had done at Fort Arthur, in\r\norder to capture Adrianople?\r\n\r\n{281}\r\n\r\nA strict censorship was established in Bulgaria.  No one, native or\r\nforeigner, who by chance saw just what the armies were doing, could\r\nhave any hope of sending out the information.  Postal and telegraphic\r\ncommunications were in the hands of the military authorities.  No one,\r\nwho happened to be in the region in which the troops were moving\r\nforward, was allowed to leave by train, automobile, bicycle, or even on\r\nfoot.  Never in history has the world been so completely in the dark as\r\nto the operations of the army.  But the attacks of the outposts of\r\nAdrianople, and the commencement of the bombardment of the forts,\r\nseemed to indicate the common objective of the three Bulgarian armies.\r\nAdrianople had the reputation of being one of the strongest fortresses\r\nin the world.  This reputation was well justified.\r\n\r\nSome miles to the east of Adrianople, guarding the mountains of the\r\nsouth-eastern frontier of Bulgaria, was Kirk Kilissé, which was also\r\nsupposed to be an impregnable position.  Here the Ottoman military\r\nauthorities had placed stores to form the base of supplies for the\r\noffensive military operation against Bulgaria.  Shortly before the war,\r\na branch railway from the sole line between Constantinople and\r\nAdrianople, going north from Lulé Burgas, was completed.  It furnished\r\ndirect means of communication between the capital and Kirk Kilissé.\r\n\r\nThe General Staff at Constantinople wisely decided to leave in\r\nAdrianople only a sufficient garrison to defend the forts and the city.\r\nIt was their intention to send the bulk of their Thracian army {282}\r\nnorth-west from Kirk Kilissé, using that fortress as a base, in order\r\nto cut off the Bulgarians from their supplies, and throw them back\r\nagainst the forts of Adrianople.  In this way they intended to put the\r\nBulgarians between two fires and crush them.  Then they would commence\r\nthe invasion of Bulgaria.  The plan was excellent.  If Turkey had\r\nactually had in the field a half million men well trained and well\r\nequipped, well officered and with a spirit of enthusiasm, and--most\r\nimportant of all--properly fed, it is probable that the Bulgarians\r\ncould have been held in check.  But this army did not exist.  The\r\nmillions spent for equipment had disappeared--who knows where?  There\r\nwere not enough horses, even with the requisitions in Constantinople,\r\nfor the artillery, and for the cavalry reserves.  That meant that there\r\nwere no horses at all for the commissary department.  The only means of\r\ncommunication with the front was a single railway track.  Roads had\r\nnever been made in Thrace since the conquest.  The artillery and the\r\nwaggons had to be drawn through deep mud.\r\n\r\nBeyond the needs of the _nizam_ (active) regiments, there were hardly\r\nany officers.  The wretched masses of _redifs_ (reservists) were\r\nwithout proper leadership.  Not only was this all important factor for\r\nkeeping up the _morale_ of the soldiers lacking, but, from the moment\r\nthey left Constantinople--even before that--there was insufficient\r\nfood.  Nor did the soldiers know why they were fighting.  There was no\r\nenthusiasm for a cause.  The great mass of the civil population, if\r\nnot, like the Christians, hostile to the army, {283} was wholly\r\nindifferent.  I do not believe there were ten thousand people in the\r\ncity of Constantinople, who really cared what happened in Thrace.\r\nSince I have been in the midst of a mobilization in France, and have\r\nseen how the French soldiers are equipped for war and fed, and how they\r\nhave been made to feel that every man, woman, and child in the nation\r\nwas ready to make any sacrifice--no matter how great--for \"the little\r\nsoldiers of France,\" I feel more deeply the tragedy of the Turkish\r\n_redifs_.  My wonder is that they were able to fight as bravely as they\r\ndid.  The world has no use for the government--for the \"system\"--which\r\ncaused them to suffer as they did, and to give their lives in a wholly\r\nuseless sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Thracian campaign I heard from the lips of many of\r\nthose who had taken part in it, when the events were still fresh in\r\ntheir memory.  It is fruitless to go into all the details, to discuss\r\nthe strategy of the generals in command, and to give a technical\r\ndescription of the battles, and of the retreat.  Turkish and Bulgarian\r\nofficers, as well as a host of foreign correspondents, have published\r\nbooks on this campaign.  Most of them hide the real causes of the\r\ndefeat under a mass of unimportant detail, and seem to be written\r\neither to emphasize the writer's claim as a \"first-hand\" witness, to\r\ntake to task certain generals, or to prove the superiority of French\r\nartillery, and the faultiness of German military instruction.  When all\r\nthese issues are cast to one side, the campaign can be briefly\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nWe have already anticipated the _débâcle_ of the military power of\r\nTurkey by giving the causes.  {284} This is not illogical.  For these\r\ncauses existed, and led to the inevitable result, before the first gun\r\nwas fired.\r\n\r\nOn October 19th, the Bulgarians began the investment of Adrianople from\r\nthe north and west.  There was no serious opposition.  The Turkish\r\ngarrison naturally fell back to the protection of the forts, for the\r\nTurks had not planned to oppose, beyond Adrianople, the Bulgarian\r\napproach.  The Ottoman advance-guard, composed of the corps of\r\nConstantinople and Rodosto, under the command of Abdullah and Mahmud\r\nMukhtar pashas, was ordered to take the offensive north of Kirk\r\nKilissé.  They were to be followed by another army.  This movement was\r\nintended to cut off the Bulgarians from their base of supplies, and\r\nthrow them back on Adrianople.  The remainder of the Turkish forces in\r\nThrace were to wait the result of this movement.  If the Bulgarians\r\nmoved down the valley of the Maritza, leaving Adrianople, they would\r\nmeet these imposing forces which covered Constantinople, and would have\r\nbehind them the garrison of Adrianople, and the army of Abdullah and\r\nMahmud Mukhtar threatening their communications.  If they besieged\r\nAdrianople, the second army would take the offensive and the Bulgarians\r\nwould be encircled.\r\n\r\nThe outposts of the Turkish army came into contact with the Bulgarians\r\non October 20th.  Believing that they had to do with the left of the\r\narmy investing Adrianople, Mahmud and Abdullah decided to begin\r\nimmediately their encircling movement.  On the 21st and 22d, the two\r\ncolumns of the Turkish {285} army were in fact engaged with the\r\nadvance-guards of the first and second Bulgarian armies.  But, in the\r\nmeantime, General Dimitrieff and the third army (which they believed\r\nwas on the extreme Bulgarian right, pressing down the Maritza to invest\r\nthe southern forts of Adrianople) had quietly crossed the frontier\r\nalmost directly north of Kirk Kilissé, and fell like a cyclone upon the\r\nTurks.  The Turkish positions were excellent, and had to be taken at\r\nthe point of the bayonet.  From morning till night on October 23d, the\r\nBulgarian third army captured position after position, without the help\r\nof their artillery, which was stuck in the mud some miles in the rear.\r\nIn the evening, during a terrible storm, two fresh Bulgarian columns\r\nmade an assault upon the Turkish positions.  It was not until then that\r\nthe Turks realized that they were fighting another army than that\r\ncharged with the investment of Adrianople.  A wild panic broke out\r\namong the _redifs_, who were mostly without officers.  They started to\r\nretreat, and were soon followed by the remainder of the army.  At\r\nUskubdere, they met during the night reinforcements coming to their\r\naid.  Two regiments fired on each other, mutually mistaking the other\r\nfor Bulgarians.  The reinforcements joined in the disorderly retreat,\r\nwhich did not end until morning, when, exhausted and still crazed by\r\nfear, what remained of the Turkish army had reached Eski Baba and Bunar\r\nHissar.\r\n\r\nThe army was saved from annihilation by the darkness and the storm.\r\nFor not only were the Bulgarians ignorant of the abandonment of Kirk\r\n{286} Kilissé, but, along the line where they knew the enemy were\r\nretreating, their cavalry could not advance in the darkness and mud,\r\nnor could their artillery shell the retreating columns.  On the morning\r\nof the 24th, when General Dimitrieff was preparing to make the assault\r\nupon Kirk Kilissé, he learned that the Turkish army had fled, and that\r\nthe fortress was undefended.\r\n\r\nBy the capture of Kirk Kilissé the Bulgarians gained enormous stores.\r\nThey had a railway line open to them towards Constantinople.  The only\r\nmenace to a successful investment of Adrianople was removed.  The\r\nvictory, so easily purchased, was far beyond their dreams.  But it\r\nwould not have been possible had it not been for the willingness of the\r\nBulgarian soldiers to charge without tiring or faltering at the point\r\nof the bayonet.  The victory was earned, in spite of the Turkish panic.\r\nFor the Bulgarian steel had much to do with that panic.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he realized the extent of the victory of Kirk Kilissé,\r\nGeneral Savoff ordered a general advance of the three Bulgarian armies.\r\nOnly enough troops were left around Adrianople to prevent a sortie of\r\nthe garrison.  Notwithstanding the unfavourable condition of the roads,\r\nthe Bulgarian armies moved with great rapidity.  The cavalry in two\r\ndays made reconnaissances on the east as far as Midia, and on the south\r\nas far as Rodosto.  The main--and sole--armies of the Turks were thus\r\nascertained to be along the Ergene, and beyond in the direction of the\r\ncapital.  On the left, the third army of General Dimitrieff, not\r\ndelaying at Kirk Kilissé, was in contact with the {287} Turks at Eski\r\nBaba on the 28th.  On the afternoon of the same day the Bulgarians\r\ndrove the Turks out of the village of Lulé Burgas, on the railway to\r\nConstantinople, east of the point where the Dedeagatch-Salonika line\r\nbranches off.\r\n\r\nFor three days, October 29-31, the Turkish armies made a stand along\r\nthe Ergene from Bunar Hissar to Lulé Burgas.  Since Gettysburg, Sadowa,\r\nand Sedan, no battle except that of Mukden has approached the battle of\r\nLulé Burgas in importance, not only because of the numbers engaged, but\r\nalso of the issue at stake.  Three hundred and fifty thousand soldiers\r\nwere in action, the forces being about evenly divided.  For two days,\r\nin spite of the demonstration of Kirk Kilissé, the Turks fought with\r\nsplendid courage and tenacity.  Time and again the desperate charges of\r\nthe Bulgarian infantry were hurled back with heavy loss.  Not until the\r\nthird day did the fighting seem to lean decisively to the advantage of\r\nthe Bulgarians.  Their artillery began to show marked superiority.\r\nFrom many points shells began to fall with deadly effect into the\r\nTurkish entrenchments.  The Turks were unable to silence the murderous\r\nfire of the Bulgarian batteries.  The soldiers, _because they were\r\nstarving_, did not have it in them to attempt to take the most\r\ntroublesome Bulgarian positions by assault.\r\n\r\nThe retreat began on the afternoon of the 31st.  On November 1st, owing\r\nto lack of officers and of central direction, it became a disorderly\r\nflight, a _sauve qui peut_.  Camp equipment was abandoned.  The\r\nsoldiers threw away their knapsacks and rifles, {288} so that they\r\ncould run more quickly.  The artillery-men cut the traces of their\r\ngun-wagons and ammunition-wagons, and made off on horseback.\r\nEverything was abandoned to the enemy.  Nazim pasha, generalissimo, and\r\nthe general staff, who had been in headquarters at Tchorlu, without\r\nproper telegraphic or telephonic communication with the battle front,\r\nwere drawn into the flight.  The Turkish army did not stop until it had\r\nplaced itself behind the Tchatalja line of forts, which protected the\r\ncity of Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Lulé Burgas marked more than the destruction of the\r\nTurkish military power and the loss of European Turkey to the Empire.\r\nIt revealed the inefficiency of Turkish organization and administration\r\nto cope with modern conditions, even when in possession of modern\r\ninstruction and modern tools.  With the Turks, it is not a question of\r\nan ignorance or a backwardness which can be remedied.  Total lack of\r\norganizing and administrative ability is a fault of their nature.\r\nCourage alone does not win battles in the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarians were without sufficient cavalry and mounted machine-guns\r\nto follow up their victory.  The defeat of the Turks, too, had not been\r\ngained without the expenditure of every ounce of energy in the army\r\nthat had in those three days won undying fame.  The problem of pursuit\r\nwas difficult.  There was only a single railway track.  Food and\r\nmunitions for the large army had to be brought up.  The artillery\r\nadvanced painfully through roads hub-deep in mud.  It took two weeks\r\nfor the Bulgarian {289} army to move from the Ergene to Tchatalja, and\r\nprepare for the assault of the last line of Turkish defence.\r\n\r\nAn immediate offensive after Lulé Burgas would have found\r\nConstantinople at the mercy of the victorious army.  The two weeks of\r\nrespite changed the aspect of things.  For in this time the forts\r\nacross the peninsula from the Sea of Marmora to the Black Sea were\r\nhastily repaired.  They were mounted with guns from the Bosphorus\r\ndefences, the Servian Creusots detained at Salonika at the beginning of\r\nthe war, and whatever artillery could be brought from Asia Minor.  The\r\narmy had been reformed, the worthless, untrained elements ruthlessly\r\nweeded out, and a hundred thousand of the best soldiers, among whom the\r\nonly _redifs_ were those who had come fresh from Asia Minor, and had\r\nnot been contaminated by the demoralization of Kirk Kilissé and Lulé\r\nBurgas, were placed behind the forts.  The Turkish cruisers whose guns\r\nwere able to be fired were recalled from the Dardanelles, and anchored\r\noff the end of the line on either side.\r\n\r\nOn November 15th, the Bulgarians began to put their artillery in\r\nposition all along the Tchatalja line from Buyuk-Tchekmedje on the Sea\r\nof Marmora to Derkos Lake, near the Black Sea.  At the same time, they\r\nentrenched the artillery positions by earthworks and ditches, working\r\nwith incredible rapidity.  For they had to take every precaution\r\nagainst a sudden sortie of the enemy.  In forty-eight hours they were\r\nready.\r\n\r\nThe attack on the Tchatalja lines commenced {290} at six o'clock on\r\nSunday morning, November 17th, by machine-gun and rifle fire as well as\r\nby artillery.  The forts and the Turkish cruisers responded.  In the\r\ncity and in the villages along the Bosphorus we could hear the firing\r\ndistinctly.  On the 17th and 18th, the Bulgarians delivered assaults in\r\nseveral places.  Near Derkos they even got through the lines for a\r\nshort while.  These were merely for the purpose of testing the Turkish\r\npositions, however.  Several of the assaults were repulsed.  The\r\nBulgarians suffered heavily on the 18th, when the first and only\r\nprisoners of the war were made.  On the 19th, the artillery fire grew\r\nless and less, and there were no further attacks.  Towards evening it\r\nwas evident that the Bulgarians had abandoned their advanced lines, and\r\ndid not intend to continue the attack.  No general assault had been\r\ndelivered.\r\n\r\nIt seems certain that General Savoff had in mind the capture of\r\nConstantinople on November 17th.  Turkish overtures for peace, opened\r\non the 15th, had been repulsed.  Every preparation was made for the\r\nattempt to pierce Tchatalja.  Why was the plan abandoned before it was\r\nactually proven impossible?  Did General Savoff fear the risk of a\r\nreverse?  Was he short of ammunition?  Had the Turkish defence of the\r\n17th and 18th been more determined than he had expected?  Was it fear\r\nof a cholera epidemic among his soldiers?  Or was the abandonment of\r\nthe attempt to capture Constantinople for that is what a triumph at\r\nTchatalja would have meant, dictated by political reasons?\r\n\r\nPerhaps there was a shortage of ammunition.  {291} But it is impossible\r\nto believe that General Savoff ceased the attack because he feared a\r\nfailure, or because he paused before the heavy sacrifice of life it\r\nwould involve.  The Bulgarians were too fresh from their sudden and\r\noverwhelming victories to be halted by the unimportant fighting of the\r\n17th and 18th.  They were not yet aware of the terrible danger from\r\ncholera.\r\n\r\nAt the time it was the common belief in Constantinople--I heard it\r\nexpressed in a number of intelligent circles--that the Great Powers--in\r\nparticular Russia--had informed Bulgaria that she should halt where she\r\nwas.  A second San Stefano!  This seems improbable.  Even in the moment\r\nof delirium over Lulé Burgas, the Bulgarians had no thought of\r\noccupying permanently Constantinople.  They knew that this would be a\r\ntask beyond their ability as a nation to undertake.  If there was a\r\nthought of entering Constantinople, it was to satisfy military pride,\r\nand to be able to dictate more expeditiously and satisfactorily terms\r\nof peace.\r\n\r\nThe real reason for the halt of Tchatalja, and the willingness to\r\nconclude an armistice, must be found in the alarm awakened in Bulgaria\r\nby the Servian and Greek successes.  Greece had settled herself in\r\nSalonika, and the King and royal family had come there to live.  Is it\r\nmerely a coincidence that _on November 18th_ the Servians captured\r\nMonastir, _foyer_ of Bulgarianism in western Macedonia, and _on the\r\nfollowing day_, a telegram from Sofia caused the cessation of the\r\nBulgarian attack upon Tchatalja?\r\n\r\n{292}\r\n\r\nAt Adrianople, a combined Bulgarian and Servian army, under the command\r\nof General Ivanoff, which had been hampered during the first month of\r\noperations by the floods of the Maritza, and by daring sorties of the\r\ngarrison, after receiving experienced reinforcements on November 22d,\r\nbegan a determined bombardment and narrow investment of the forts.  Ten\r\ndays later, a general attack was ordered, probably to hurry the Turks\r\nin the armistice negotiations.  The investing army had made very little\r\nprogress on December 2d and 3d, when the signing of the armistice\r\ncaused a cessation of hostilities.\r\n\r\nBut while the Bulgarians were vigorously pressing the attack upon\r\nAdrianople, they were inactive at Tchatalja.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Thracian campaign, a portion of the Turkish\r\nfleet started to attack the Bulgarian coast.  The Bulgarians had only\r\none small cruiser and six torpedo-boats of doubtful value.  But their\r\ntwo ports, termini of railway lines, were well protected by forts.  On\r\nOctober 19th, two Turkish battleships and four torpedo-boats appeared\r\nbefore Varna, and fired without effect upon the forts.  Then they\r\nbombarded the small open port of Kavarna, near the Rumanian frontier.\r\nOn the 21st, they succeeded in throwing a few shells into Varna, but\r\ndid not risk approaching near enough to do serious damage.  This was\r\nthe extent of the offensive naval action against Bulgaria.  A short\r\ntime later, the _Hamidieh_, which was stationed on the Thracian coast\r\nof the Black Sea to protect the landing of _redifs_ from Samsun, was\r\nsurprised in the night by {293} Bulgarian torpedo-boats.  Two torpedoes\r\ntore holes in her bow.  She was able to return to Constantinople under\r\nher own steam, but had to spend ten weeks in dry-dock.  The only\r\nservice rendered by the Turkish fleet against the Bulgarians was the\r\nsafeguarding of the transport of troops from Black Sea ports of Asiatic\r\nTurkey, and the co-operation at the ends of the Tchatalja lines during\r\nthe Bulgarian assaults of November 17th and 18th.\r\n\r\nThe Servian campaign was a good second to the astounding successes of\r\nthe Bulgarians in Thrace.  The third army entered the _sandjak_ of Novi\r\nBazar, so long coveted by Servia, and expelled the Turks in five days.\r\nA portion of this army next occupied Prisrend and Diakova, descended\r\nthe valley of the Drin through the heart of northern Albania to\r\nAlessio, where it joined on November 19th the Montenegrins, who were\r\nalready at San Giovanni di Medua.  On the 28th, they occupied Durazzo.\r\nThe Servians had reached the Adriatic!\r\n\r\nWhile the third army was in the _sandjak_ of Novi Bazar, the second\r\nServian army crossed into Old Servia, passed through the plain of\r\nKossova, where the Turks had destroyed the independence of Servia in\r\n1389, and occupied Pristina on October 23d.  This gave them control of\r\nthe branch railway from Uskub to the confines of the _sandjak_.\r\n\r\nThe flower of the Servian fighting strength was reserved for the first\r\narmy under the command of Crown Prince Alexander.  This force,\r\nconsiderably larger than the two other armies combined, mustered over\r\nseventy thousand.  Its objective point was {294} Uskub, covering which\r\nwas the strong Turkish army of Zekki pasha.  Battle was joined outside\r\nof Kumanova on October 22d.  After three days of fighting, during which\r\nthe Turkish cavalry was annihilated by the Servian artillery and the\r\nServian infantry took the Turkish artillery positions at the point of\r\nthe bayonet, the army of Zekki Pasha evacuated Kumanova.  No attempt\r\nwas made to defend Uskub, which the Servians entered on October 26th.\r\nThe Turkish army retreated to Küprülü on the Vardar, towards Salonika.\r\nWhen the Servians continued their march, Zekki pasha retreated to\r\nPrilip, where he occupied positions that could not well be shelled by\r\nartillery.  After two days of continuous fighting, the Servians'\r\nbayonets dislodged the Turks.  They withdrew to Monastir with the\r\nServians hot upon their heels.\r\n\r\nTogether with Kumanova, in which the bulk of Prince Alexander's forces\r\ndid not find it necessary to engage, the capture of Monastir is the\r\nmost brilliant feat of an army whose intrepidity, agility, and\r\nintelligence deserve highest praise.  Into Monastir had been thrown the\r\narmy of Tahsin pasha, pushed northward by the Greeks, as well as that\r\nof Zekki pasha, harried southward by the Servians.  The Servians did\r\nnot hesitate to approach the defences of the city on one side up to\r\ntheir arm-pits in water, while on the other side they scaled the\r\nheights dominating Monastir--heights which ought to have been defended\r\nfor weeks without great difficulty.  The Turks were compelled to\r\nwithdraw, for they were at the mercy of the Servian artillery.  They\r\ntried to {295} retreat to Okrida, but the Servian left wing anticipated\r\nthis movement.  Only ten thousand escaped into Epirus.  Nearly forty\r\nthousand Turks surrendered to the Servians on November 18th.  Monastir\r\nand Okrida were captured.  The Turkish armies of Macedonia had ceased\r\nto exist.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks were eager to wipe out the shame of the war of 1897.\r\nFifteen years had wrought a great difference in the _morale_ of the\r\nGreek army.  A new body of officers, who spent their time in learning\r\ntheir profession instead of in discussing politics at _café terrasses_,\r\nhad been created.  The French military mission, under General Eydoux,\r\nhad been working for several years in the complete reorganization of\r\nthe Greek army.  I had the privilege at Athens of enjoying the\r\nhospitality of Greek officers in their casernes at several successive\r\nEaster festivals.  Each year one could notice the progress.  They were\r\nalways ready to show you how the transformation of their artillery, and\r\nits equipment for mountain service as well as for field work, would\r\nmake all the difference in the world in the \"approaching\" war with the\r\nTurks.  The results were beyond expectations.  What the Greeks had been\r\nworking for was mobility.  This they demonstrated that they had\r\nlearned.  They had also an _esprit de corps_ which, in fighting, made\r\nup for what they lacked of Slavic dogged perseverance.  Neither in\r\nactual combat, nor in strategy, with the exception of Janina, were the\r\nGreeks put to the test, or called upon to bear the burden, of the\r\nBulgarians and Servians.  But, especially when we take into\r\nconsideration the {296} invaluable service of their fleet, there is no\r\nreason to belittle their part in the downfall of Turkey.  If the effort\r\nhad been necessary, they probably would have been equal to it.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks sent a small army into Epirus.  The bulk of their forces,\r\nfollowing a sound military principle, were led into Thessaly by the\r\nCrown Prince Constantine.  They crossed the frontier without\r\nresistance, fought a sharp combat at Elassona on the 19th, in which\r\nthey stood admirably under fire, and broke down the last Turkish\r\nresistance at Servia.  The army of Tahsin pasha was thrown back upon\r\nMonastir.  The battles of the next ten days were hardly more than\r\nskirmishes, for the Turkish stand was never formidable.  At Yanitza,\r\nthe only real battle of the Greek campaign was fought.  The Turks fled.\r\nThe way to Salonika was open.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Yanitza (Yenidje-Vardar) was fought on November 3d.  On\r\nOctober 30th, a Greek torpedo-boat had succeeded, in spite of the\r\nstrong harbour fortifications, equipped with electric searchlights, and\r\nthe mined channel, in coming right up to the jetty at Salonika during\r\nthe night, and launching three torpedoes at an old Turkish cruiser\r\nwhich lay at anchor there.  The cruiser sank.  On his way out to open\r\nsea, the commander of the torpedo-boat did not hesitate to fire upon\r\nthe forts!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map--Africa in 1914]\r\n\r\nThis daring feat, and the approach of the Greek army, threw the city\r\ninto a turmoil of excitement.  The people had been fed for two weeks on\r\nfalse news, and telegrams had been printed from day to day, relating\r\nwonderful victories over the Servians, {297} Bulgarians, and Greeks.\r\nBut the coming of the refugees, fresh thousands from nearer places\r\nevery day, and the presence in the streets of the city of deserters in\r\nuniform, gave the lie to the \"official\" news.  When the German\r\n_stationnaire_ arrived from Constantinople, and embarked the prisoner\r\nof the Villa Allatini, ex-Sultan Abdul Hamid, the most pessimistic\r\nsuspicions were confirmed.\r\n\r\nAlthough he had thirty thousand soldiers, and plenty of munitions,\r\nTahsin pasha, commandant of Salonika, did not even attempt to defend\r\nthe city.  He began immediately to negotiate with the advancing Greek\r\narmy.  When the Crown Prince refused to accept any other than\r\nunconditional surrender, and moved upon the city, Tahsin pasha yielded.\r\nNot a shot was fired.  On November 9th, without any opposition, the\r\nGreek army marched into Salonika.\r\n\r\nIn other places the Turks at least fought, even if they did not fight\r\nwell.  At Salonika their surrender demonstrated to what humiliation and\r\ndegradation the arrogance of the Young Turks had brought a nation whose\r\npast was filled with glorious deeds of arms.\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarian expeditionary corps for Macedonia, under General\r\nTheodoroff, had crossed the frontier on October 18th.  Joined to it\r\nwere the notorious bands of _comitadjis_ under the command of\r\nSandansky, who afterwards related to me the story of this march.\r\nGeneral Theodoroff's mission was to engage the portion of the Turkish\r\nFifth Army Corps, which was stationed in the valleys of the Mesta and\r\nStruma, {298} east of the Vardar, thus preventing it from assembling\r\nand making a flank movement against the main Servian or Bulgarian\r\narmies.  The Bulgarians were greeted everywhere as liberators, and,\r\nalthough they were not in great numbers, the Turks did not try to\r\noppose them.  Soldiers and Moslem Macedonians together fled before them\r\ntowards Salonika.\r\n\r\nWhen General Theodoroff realized the demoralization of the Turks, and\r\nheard how the Greeks were approaching Salonika without any more serious\r\nopposition than that which confronted him, he hurried his column\r\ntowards Salonika.  The Bulgarian Princes Boris and Cyril joined him.\r\nThey were not in time to take part in the negotiations for the\r\nsurrender of the city.  The cowardice of Tahsin pasha had brought\r\nmatters to a climax on November 9th.  But they were able to enter\r\nSalonika on the 10th, at the same time that Crown Prince Constantine\r\nwas making his triumphal entry.  Sandansky and his _comitadjis_ hurried\r\nto the principal ancient church of the city, for over four hundred\r\nyears the Saint Sophia of Salonika, and placed the Bulgarian flag in\r\nthe minarets before the Greeks knew they had been outwitted.  On the\r\n12th, King George of Greece arrived to make his residence in the city\r\nthat was to be his tomb.\r\n\r\nAfter the capture of Monastir, the Servians pressed on to Okrida, on\r\nNovember 23d, and from there into Albania to Elbassan, which they\r\nreached five days later.  It was their intention to join at Durazzo the\r\nother column of the third Servian army, of whose march down the Drin we\r\nhave already spoken.  But {299} the threatening attitude of\r\nAustria-Hungary necessitated the recall of the bulk of the Servian\r\nforces to Nish.  This is the reason they were not able, at that stage\r\nof the war, to give the Montenegrins effective assistance against\r\nScutari.\r\n\r\nThe left wing of the Thessalian Greek army, after the capture of\r\nMonastir by the Servians, pursued towards Albania, the Turks who had\r\nescaped from Monastir.  With great skill, they managed to prevent the\r\nTurks from turning north-west into the interior of Albania.  After the\r\nbrilliant and daring storming of the heights of Tchangan, what remained\r\nof the Turkish army was compelled to retreat into Epirus towards Janina.\r\n\r\nOn October 20th, the Greek fleet under Admiral Koundouriotis appeared\r\nat the Dardanelles to offer battle to the Turks.  Under the cover of\r\nthe protection of their fleet, the Greeks occupied Lemnos, Thasos,\r\nImbros, Samothrace, Nikaria, and the smaller islands.  The inhabitants\r\nof Samos had expelled the Turkish garrisons on their own initiative at\r\nthe outbreak of the war.  Mitylene was captured without great\r\ndifficulty on November 2lst.  The Greeks landed at Chios on the 24th.\r\nHere the Turkish garrison of two thousand retired to the mountainous\r\ncentre of the island, and succeeded in prolonging their resistance\r\nuntil January.  When he saw that no help was coming from Asia Minor,\r\nwhose shores had been in sight during all the weeks of combat and\r\nsuffering, the heroic Turkish commander surrendered with one thousand\r\neight hundred starving men on January 3d.  It was only because Italy,\r\n{300} by a clause of the Treaty of Ouchy, still held the Dodecanese,\r\nthat all of the Ægean Islands were not \"gathered into the fold\" by\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\nThere had been less than six weeks of fighting.  The Balkan allies had\r\nswept from the field all the Turkish forces in Europe.  The Turkish\r\narmies were bottled up in Constantinople, Adrianople, Janma, and\r\nScutari, with absolutely no hope of making successful sorties.  Except\r\nat Constantinople, they were besieged, and could expect neither\r\nreinforcements nor food supplies.  The Greek fleet was master of the\r\nÆgean Sea, and held the Turkish navy blocked in the Dardanelles.  No\r\nnew armies could come from Asiatic Turkey.  This was the situation when\r\nthe armistice was signed.  The Ottoman Empire in Europe had ceased to\r\nexist.  The military prestige of Turkey had received a mortal blow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARMISTICE AND THE FIRST CONFERENCE OF LONDON\r\n\r\nThe hopelessness of the outcome of the war with Italy, the\r\ndissatisfaction over the foolish and arbitrary rule of its secret\r\ncommittees had weakened the hold of the \"Committee of Union and\r\nProgress\" over the army.  Despite its success in the spring elections\r\nof 1912, its position was precarious.  In July, Mahmud Shevket pasha,\r\nwho was suspected of planning a military _pronunciamento_, resigned the\r\nMinistry of War.  The Grand Vizier, Saïd pasha, soon followed him into\r\nretirement.  The Sultan declared that a {301} ministry not under the\r\ncontrol of a political party was a necessity.\r\n\r\nGhazi Mukhtar pasha, after much difficulty, succeeded in forming a\r\nministry, in which a distinguished Armenian, Noradounghian effendi, was\r\ngiven the portfolio of Foreign Affairs.  The Unionist majority in the\r\nlower house of Parliament proved intractable.  Its obstructionist\r\ntactics won for the Chamber of Deputies the name of the \"comic\r\noperahouse of Fundukli.\"  (Fundukli was the Bosphorus quarter in which\r\nthe House of Parliament was located.)  With the help of the Senate, and\r\nthe moral support of the army, the Sultan dissolved Parliament on\r\nAugust 5th.  Only the menace of the Albanian revolution prevented the\r\nCommittee from attempting to set up a rival Parliament at Salonika.\r\nThis was the unenviable internal situation of Turkey at the opening of\r\nthe Balkan War.\r\n\r\nThe disasters of the Thracian campaign led to the resignation of the\r\nGhazi Mukhtar pasha Cabinet.  The aged statesman of the old _régime_,\r\nKiamil pasha, was called for the eighth time to the Grand Vizirate.  He\r\nretained Nazim pasha, generalissimo of the Turkish army, and\r\nNoradounghian effendi, in the Ministries of War and Foreign Affairs.\r\nThe most influential of the Young Turks, who had opposed bitterly the\r\npeace with Italy and were equally determined that no negotiations\r\nshould be undertaken with the Balkan States, were exiled.  Kiamil pasha\r\nsaw clearly that peace was absolutely necessary.  His long experience\r\nallowed him to have no illusions as to the possibility of continuing\r\nthe struggle.  Before {302} the Bulgarian attack upon Tchatalja, he\r\nbegan _pourparlers_ with General Savoff.  After the repulse of November\r\n17th and 18th, he was just as firm in his decision that the\r\nnegotiations must be continued.  He won over to his point of view the\r\nmembers of the Cabinet, and notably Nazim pasha.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of the armistice, signed on December 3d, were an\r\nacknowledgment of the complete _débâcle_ of the Turkish army.  Bulgaria\r\nforced the stipulation that her army in front of Tchatalja should be\r\nrevictualled by the railway which passed under the guns of Adrianople,\r\nwhile that fortress remained without food!  Greece, by an agreement\r\nwith her allies, refused to sign the armistice, but was allowed to be\r\nrepresented in the peace conference.  The allies felt that the state of\r\nwar on sea must continue, in order that Turkey should be prevented\r\nduring the armistice from bringing to the front her army corps from\r\nSyria and Mesopotamia and Arabia; while Greece, in particular, was\r\ndetermined to run no risk in connection with the Ægean Islands.  The\r\npeace delegates were to meet in London.\r\n\r\nOrientals, Christian as well as Moslem, are famous for bargaining.\r\nNothing can be accomplished without an exchange of proposals and\r\ncounter-proposals _ad infinitum_.  In the Conference of London, the\r\ndemands of the allies were the cession of all European Turkey, except\r\nAlbania, whose boundaries were not defined, of Crete, and of the\r\nislands in the Ægean Sea.  A war indemnity was also demanded.  Turkey\r\nwas to be allowed to retain Constantinople, and a strip of territory\r\nfrom Midia on the Black Sea to {303} Rodosto on the Sea of Marmora, and\r\nthe peninsula of the Thracian Chersonese, which formed the European\r\nshore of the Dardanelles.  The boundaries of Albania, and its future\r\nstatus, were to be decided by the Powers.\r\n\r\nI had a long conversation with the Grand Vizier, Kiamil pasha, on the\r\nday the peace delegates left for London.  He was frank and unhesitating\r\nin the statement of his belief that Turkey could not continue the war.\r\nHe denounced unsparingly the visionaries who were clamouring for a\r\ncontinuance of the struggle.  \"It is because of them that we are in our\r\npresent humiliating position,\" he said.  \"They cry out now that we must\r\nnot accept peace, but they know well that we cannot hope to win back\r\nany portion of what we have lost.\"\r\n\r\nThere were a number of reasons why the position of Kiamil pasha was\r\nsound.  First of all, the army organization was in hopeless confusion.\r\nAlthough the Bulgarians were checked at Tchatalja, the conditions on\r\nthe Constantinople side of the forts was terrible.  The general\r\nheadquarters at Hademkeuy were buried in filth and mud.  Although the\r\narmy was but twenty-five miles from the city, there were days on end\r\nwhen not even bread arrived.  Cholera was making great ravages.\r\nSoldiers, crazed from hunger, were shot dead for disobeying the order\r\nwhich forbade their eating raw vegetables.  There were neither fuel,\r\nshelter, nor blankets.  Winter was at hand.  At San Stefano, one of the\r\nmost beautiful suburbs of Stambul, in a concentration camp the soldiers\r\ndied by the thousands of starvation fever.  {304} It was one of the\r\nmost heart-rending tragedies of history.\r\n\r\nAll the while, in the cafés of Péra, Galata, and Stambul, Turkish\r\nofficers sat the day long, sipping their coffee, and deciding that\r\nAdrianople must not be given up.  Even while the fighting was going on,\r\nwhen the fate of the city hung in the balance, I saw these degenerate\r\nofficers _by the hundreds_, feasting at Péra, while their soldiers were\r\ndying like dogs at Tchatalja and San Stefano.  This is an awful\r\nstatement to make, but it is the record of fact.  Notices in the\r\nnewspapers, declaring that officers found in Constantinople without\r\npermission would be immediately taken before the Court-Martial, had\r\nabsolutely no effect.\r\n\r\nThe navy failed to give any account of itself to the Greeks, who were\r\nwaiting outside of the Dardanelles.  Finally, on December 16th, after\r\nthe people of the vicinity had openly cursed and taunted them, the\r\nfleet sailed out to fight.  An action at long range did little damage\r\nto either side.  The Turkish vessels refused to go beyond the\r\nprotection of their forts.  They returned in the evening to anchor.\r\nThe mastery of the sea remained to the Greeks.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In this connection, it would be forgetting to pay tribute to a\r\nremarkable exploit to omit mention of the raid of the _Hamidieh_ during\r\nthe late winter.  One Ottoman officer at least chafed under the\r\ndisgrace of the inaction of the Ottoman navy.  With daring and skill,\r\nCaptain Reouf bey slipped out into the Ægean Sea on the American-built\r\ncruiser, the _Hamidieh_.  He evaded the Greek blockaders, bombarded\r\nsome outposts on one of the islands, and sank the auxiliary cruiser,\r\nthe _Makedonia_, in a Greek port.  The _Hamidieh_ next appeared in the\r\nAdriatic, where she sank several transports, and bombarded Greek\r\npositions on the coast of Albania.  The cruiser was next heard of at\r\nPort Said.  She passed through the Suez Canal into the Red Sea for a\r\ncouple of weeks, and then returned boldly into the Mediterranean,\r\nalthough Greek torpedo-boats were lying in wait.  Captain Reouf bey ran\r\nagain the gauntlet of the Greek fleet, and got back to the Dardanelles\r\nwithout mishap.  This venture, undertaken without permission from the\r\nTurkish admiral, had no effect upon the war.  For it came too late.\r\nBut it showed what a little enterprise and courage might have done to\r\nprevent the Turkish débâcle, if undertaken at the beginning of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n{305}\r\n\r\nIf the army and the navy were powerless, how about the people of the\r\ncapital?  From the very beginning of the war, the inhabitants of\r\nConstantinople, Moslem as well as Christian, displayed the most\r\ncomplete indifference concerning the fortunes of the battles.  Even\r\nwhen the Bulgarians were attacking Tchatalja, the city took little\r\ninterest.  Buying and selling went on as usual.  There were few\r\nvolunteers for national defence, but the cafés were crowded and the\r\ntheatres and dance-halls of Péra were going at full swing.  The\r\nrefugees came and camped in our streets and in the cemeteries outside\r\nof the walls.  Those who did not die passed on to Asia.  The wounded\r\narrived, and crowded our hospitals and barracks.  The cholera came.\r\nThe soldiers starved to death at San Stefano.  The spirit of Byzantium\r\nwas over the city still.  The year 1913 began as 1453 had begun.\r\n\r\nThe Government tried to raise money by a national loan.  It could get\r\nnone from Europe, unless it agreed to surrender Adrianople and make\r\npeace practically on the terms of the allies.  An appeal must be made\r\nto the Osmanlis.  For how could the war be resumed without money?\r\nThere are many wealthy pashas at Constantinople.  Their palaces line\r\nboth shores of the Bosphorus.  They spend money at Monte Carlo {306}\r\nlike water.  They live at Nice, as they live at Constantinople, like\r\nprinces--or like American millionaires!  One of the sanest and wisest\r\nof Turkish patriots, a man whom I have known and admired, was appointed\r\nto head a committee to wait upon these pashas, many of them married to\r\nprincesses of the imperial family, and solicit their contributions.\r\nThe scheme was that the subscribers should advance five years of taxes\r\non their properties for the purposes of national defence.  The\r\ncommittee hired a small launch, and spent a day visiting the homes of\r\nthe pashas.  On their return, after paying the rental of the launch,\r\nthey had about forty pounds sterling!  Was it not two million pounds\r\nthat was raised for the Prince of Wales Fund recently in London?  Was\r\nnot the French loan \"for national defence,\" issued just before the\r\npresent war, subscribed in a few hours _forty-three times _over the\r\nlarge amount of thirty-two million pounds asked for?\r\n\r\nIn the face of these facts, the Young Turks were vociferous in their\r\ndemand that the war be continued.  Adrianople must not be surrendered!\r\nKiamil pasha decided to call a \"Divan,\" or National Assembly, of the\r\nmost important men in Turkey.  They were summoned by the Sultan to meet\r\nat the palace of Dolma-Baghtche on January 22, 1913.  I went to see\r\nwhat would happen there.  One would expect that the whole of\r\nConstantinople would be hanging on the words of this council, whose\r\ndecision the Cabinet had agreed to accept.  A half-dozen policemen at\r\nthe palace gate, a vendor of lemonade, two street-sweepers, an Italian\r\ncinematograph photographer, {307} and a dozen foreign newspaper\r\nmen--that was the extent of the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe Divan, after hearing the _exposés_ of the Ministers of War,\r\nFinance, and Foreign Affairs, decided that there was nothing to\r\ndiscuss.  The decision was inevitable.  Peace must be signed.  That\r\nnight Kiamil pasha telegraphed to London to the Turkish commissioners,\r\ndirecting them to consent to the reddition of Adrianople; and, the\r\nother fortresses which were still holding out, and to make peace at the\r\nprice of ceding all the Ottoman territories in Europe beyond a line\r\nrunning from Enos on the Ægean Sea, at the mouth of the Maritza River,\r\nto Midia on the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, January 23d, a _coup d'état_ was successfully\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\nEnver bey, the former \"hero of liberty,\" who had taken a daring and\r\npraiseworthy part in the revolution of 1908, had been ruined afterwards\r\nby being appointed military _attaché_ of the Ottoman Embassy at Berlin.\r\nThere was much that was admirable and winning in Enver bey, much that\r\nwas what the French call \"elevation of soul.\"  He was a sincere\r\npatriot.  But the years at Berlin, and the deadening influence of\r\nmilitarism and party politics mixed together, had changed him from a\r\npatriot to a politician.  He went to Tripoli during the Italian War,\r\nand organized a resistance in Benghazi, which he announced would be \"as\r\nlong as he lived.\"  But it was a decision _à la Turque_.  The Balkan\r\nWar found him again at Constantinople--not at the front leading a\r\ncompany against the enemy--but at {308} Constantinople, plotting with\r\nthe other Young Turks how they could once more get the reins of\r\ngovernment in their hands.  The decision of the Divan was the\r\nopportunity.  Enver bey led a small band of followers into the Sublime\r\nPorte, and shot Nazim pasha and his _aide-de-camp_ dead.  The other\r\nmembers of the Cabinet were imprisoned, and the telephone to the palace\r\ncut.  Enver bey was driven at full speed in an automobile to the\r\npalace.  He secured from the Sultan a _firman_ calling on Mahmud\r\nShevket pasha to form a new Cabinet.  The Young Turks were again in\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of Nazim pasha and the _aide-de-camp_ were buried quickly\r\nand secretly.  For one of Enver's companions, a man of absolutely no\r\nimportance, who had been killed by defenders of Nazim, a great military\r\nfuneral was held.\r\n\r\nMahmud Shevket pasha, who had been living in retirement at Scutari\r\nsince the war began, accepted the position of Grand Vizier.  I heard\r\nhim, on the steps of the Sublime Porte, justify the murder of Nazim\r\npasha, on the ground that there had been the intention to give up\r\nAdrianople.  The new Cabinet was going to redeem the country, and save\r\nit from a shameful peace.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the _coup d'état_ reached London, it was recognized\r\nthat further negotiations were useless.  The peace conference had\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND PERIOD OF THE WAR\r\n\r\nIt is very doubtful if Mahmud Shevket, Enver, and their accomplices had\r\nany hope whatever of {309} retrieving the fortunes of Turkish arms.\r\nThey had prepared the _coup d'état_ to get back again into office.\r\nThis could not be done without the tacit consent of the army.  At the\r\nmoment of the Divan the army was stirred up over the surrender of\r\nAdrianople.  It was the moment to act.  At any other time the army\r\nwould not have acquiesced in the murder of its generalissimo.  The\r\nSultan's part in the plot was not clear.  His assent was, however,\r\nimmediately given.  Living in seclusion, and knowing practically\r\nnothing of what was going on, he signed the _firmans_, accepting the\r\nresignation of the Kiamil pasha Cabinet and charging Mahmud Shevket\r\nwith the formation of a new Cabinet, either by force or by playing upon\r\nhis fears of what might be his own fate, should the agreement to\r\nsurrender Adrianople lead to a revolution.\r\n\r\nOn January 29th, the allies denounced the armistice, and hostilities\r\nreopened.  The Bulgarians at Tchatalja had strongly entrenched\r\nthemselves, and were content to rest on the defensive.  They did not\r\ndesire to capture Constantinople.  But the Turks wanted to relieve\r\nAdrianople.  The offensive movement must come from them.  The Young\r\nTurks had killed Nazim pasha, they said, because they believed\r\nAdrianople could be saved.  The word was now to Mahmud Shevket and\r\nEnver.  Let them justify their action.\r\n\r\nEnthusiastic speeches were made at Constantinople.  We were told that\r\nthe army at Tchatalja had moved forward, and was going to drive the\r\nBulgarians out of Thrace.  The Turks did advance some kilometres, but,\r\nlike their fleet at the Dardanelles, {310} not beyond the protection of\r\nthe forts!  They did not dare to make a general assault upon the\r\nBulgarian positions.  The renewal of the war, as far as Tchatalja was\r\nconcerned, was a perfect farce.  Every one in Constantinople knew that\r\nthe army was not even trying to relieve Adrianople by a forward march\r\nfrom Constantinople.\r\n\r\nEnver bey, who realized that he must make some move to justify the\r\n_coup d'état_ of January 23d, gathered two army corps on the small\r\nboats which serve the Bosphorus villages and the Isles of Princes.  It\r\nwas his intention to land on the European shore of the Dardanelles, and\r\ntake the Bulgarians in the rear.  A few of his troops--the first that\r\nwere sent--disembarked at Gallipoli, and, co-operating with the\r\nDardanelles garrison, attempted an offensive movement against the\r\nBulgarian positions at Bulair, which were bottling the peninsula.  The\r\nattack failed ignominiously.  For the Bulgarians, after dispersing the\r\nfirst bayonet charge by their machine-guns, were not content to wait\r\nfor another attack.  They scrambled over their trenches, and attacked\r\nthe Turks at the point of the bayonet.  The army broke, and fled.  Some\r\nsix thousand Turks were left on the field.  The Bulgarian losses were\r\ntrifling.  On the same day, February 8th, and the following day, the\r\nrest of Enver bey's forces tried to land at several places on the\r\nEuropean shore of the Sea of Marmora.  For some reason that has never\r\nbeen explained, the Turkish fleet did not co-operate with Enver bey's\r\nattempted landings.  Naturally the Turks were mowed down.  At Sharkeuy\r\nit was simply slaughter.  {311} Three divisions were butchered.  Those\r\nfew who succeeded in getting foot on shore were driven into the sea and\r\nbayoneted.  The two corps were practically annihilated.\r\n\r\nAfter this exploit, Enver bey returned to Constantinople, and received\r\nthe congratulations of the Grand Vizier whom he had created, by a\r\nmurder, _to redeem Turkey and recover Adrianople_.\r\n\r\nThe inability to advance at Tchatalja and at Bulair, and the failure to\r\nland troops on the coasts of Thrace, entirely immobilized the Turkish\r\narmies during the second period of the war.  They were content to sit\r\nand watch the fall of the three fortresses of Janina, Adrianople, and\r\nScutari.  At the moment of the _coup d'état_, I telegraphed that the\r\nwhole miserable affair was nothing more than a party move of the \"outs\"\r\nto oust the \"ins.\"  The events confirmed this judgment.  Mahmud Shevket\r\npasha had no other policy than that of Kiamil pasha and Nazim pasha.\r\nHe, and the Young Turk party, did absolutely nothing to relieve the\r\nsituation.  As soon as they thought they were safe from those who swore\r\nto avenge Nazim's death, they began again negotiations for peace, and\r\non exactly the same terms.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Greeks, who had not signed the armistice, decided\r\nthat they must take Janina by assault.  The worst of the winter was not\r\nyet over, but plans were made to increase the small Greek forces which\r\nhad been practically inactive since the siege began.  Janina had never\r\nbeen completely invested.  When the Crown Prince arrived, he planned to\r\ncapture the most troublesome forts, and {312} from them to make\r\nuntenable the formidable hills which commanded the city.  The Greeks\r\nfollowed the plan with great skill and courage.  Position after\r\nposition was taken until the city was at the mercy of their artillery.\r\nDuring the night of March 5th, Essad pasha sent to Prince Constantino\r\nemissaries to surrender the city, garrison, and munitions of war\r\nwithout conditions.\r\n\r\nThe Crown Prince returned to Salonika in triumph.  A few days later,\r\nthe assassination of King George made him King.  From this time on, the\r\ndiplomatic position of Premier Venizelos, in his endeavour to keep\r\nwithin bounds the military party which had the ear of the new King,\r\nbecame most difficult.  Even his great genius could not prevent the\r\nrupture with Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Janina, the Bulgarian general staff realized that it\r\nwas essential for them to force the capitulation of Adrianople, or to\r\ntake the city by assault.  As they had to keep a large portion of their\r\narmy before Tchatalja and Bulair, it was decided that forty-five\r\nthousand Servians, with their siege cannon, should co-operate in the\r\nattack upon Adrianople.  It was afterwards given by the Servians as an\r\nexcuse for breaking their treaty with Bulgaria, that they had helped in\r\nthe fall of Adrianople.  But it must be remembered that the Bulgarian\r\narmy, by its maintenance of the positions at Tchatalja and Bulair, was\r\nrendering service not to herself alone but to the common cause of the\r\nallies.  Greece and Servia will never be able to get away from the fact\r\nthat Bulgaria bore the brunt of the burden in the first {313} Balkan\r\nWar, and that her services in the common cause were far greater than\r\nthose of either of her allies.  One cannot too strongly emphasize the\r\npoint, also, that the capture and possession of Adrianople did not mean\r\nto Bulgaria either from the practical or from the sentimental\r\nstandpoint what Salonika meant to the Greeks and Uskub to the Servians.\r\nThe Servian contingent before Adrianople was not helping Bulgaria to do\r\nwhat was to be wholly to the benefit of Bulgaria.  The Servians were\r\nco-operating in an enterprise that was to contribute to the success of\r\ntheir common cause.\r\n\r\nAdrianople had been closely invested ever since the battle of Kirk\r\nKilissé.  No army came to the relief of the garrison after the fatal\r\nretreat of October 24th.  The Bulgarians had not made a serious effort\r\nto capture the city during the first period of the war.  The armistice\r\nserved their ends well, because each day lessened the provisions of the\r\nbesieged.  Inside the city Shukri pasha had done all he could to keep\r\nup the courage of the inhabitants.  He himself was ignorant of the real\r\nsituation at Constantinople.  Perhaps it was in good faith that he\r\nassured the garrison continually that the hour of deliverance was at\r\nhand.  By wireless, the authorities at Constantinople, after the _coup\r\nd'état_ especially, kept assuring him that the army was advancing, and\r\nthat it was a question only of days.  So, in spite of starvation and of\r\nthe continual rain of shells upon the city, he managed to maintain the\r\n_morale_ of his garrison.  The allies finally decided upon a systematic\r\nassault of the forts on all sides of the city at once.  In this way,\r\n{314} the Turks were not able to use their heavy artillery to best\r\nadvantage.  Advancing with scissors, the Bulgarians and Servians cut\r\ntheir way through the tangle of barbed wire.  On the 24th and 25th, the\r\nforts fell one after the other.  Czar Ferdinand entered the city with\r\nhis troops on March 26th.\r\n\r\nIt was at the moment of this heroic capture, in which there was glory\r\nenough for all, that the clouds of trouble between Bulgaria and Servia\r\nbegan to appear on the horizon.  Shukri pasha, following the old policy\r\nof the Turks, which had been so successful for centuries in the Balkan\r\nPeninsula, tried to surrender to the Servian general, who was too loyal\r\nto discipline to fall into this trap.  But the Servian newspapers began\r\nto say that it was really the Servian army who had captured the city,\r\nand that Shukri pasha recognized this fact when he sent to find the\r\nServian commander.  There was an unedifying duel of newspapers between\r\nBelgrade and Sofia, which showed that the material for conflagration\r\nwas ready.\r\n\r\nIn the second period of the war, the Servians gave substantial aid,\r\nespecially in artillery, to the Montenegrins, who had been besieging\r\nScutari ever since October 15th.  I went over the mountain of Tarabosh\r\non horse with an Albanian who had been one of its defenders.  He\r\nrelated graphically the story of the repeated assaults of the\r\nMontenegrins and Servians.  Each time they were driven back before they\r\nreached those batteries that dominated Scutari and made impossible the\r\nentry to the city without their capture.  The loss of life was\r\ntremendous.  The bravery of the {315} assailants could do nothing\r\nagainst the miles and miles of barbed wire.  No means of stopping\r\nassault has ever proved more efficacious.  The besiegers were unable to\r\ncapture Tarabosh.  So they could not enter the city.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the war, Scutari was under the command of Hassan\r\nRiza pasha.  In February, he was assassinated by his subordinate, Essad\r\npasha, an Albanian of the Toptani family, who had been a favourite of\r\nAbdul Hamid, and had had a rather questionable career in the\r\n_gendarmerie_ during the days of despotism.  After the assassination of\r\nthe Turkish commandant, it was for Albania and not for Turkey that\r\nEssad pasha continued the resistance.  In March, Austria began to\r\nthreaten the Montenegrins, and assure them that they could not keep the\r\ncity.  The story of how she secured the agreement of the Great Powers\r\nin coercing Montenegro is told in another chapter.  Montenegro was\r\ndefiant, and paid no attention to an international blockade.  But on\r\nApril 13th, the Servians, fearing international complications, withdrew\r\nfrom the siege.  It was astonishing news to the world that after this,\r\non April 22d, Essad pasha surrendered Scutari to the King of\r\nMontenegro, with the stipulation that he could withdraw with his\r\ngarrison, his light artillery, and whatever munitions he might be able\r\nto take with him.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman flag had ceased to wave in any part of Europe except\r\nConstantinople and the Dardanelles.  The war was over, whether the\r\nYoung Turks would have it so or not.  Facts are facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{316}\r\n\r\nTHE TREATY OF LONDON\r\n\r\nNazim pasha was assassinated on January 23d.  The armistice was\r\ndenounced on the 29th.  On February 10th, Mahmud Shevket pasha began to\r\nsound the Great Powers for their intervention in securing peace.  It\r\nwas necessary, however, now that the war had been resumed, that the\r\nimpossibility of relieving Adrianople be demonstrated, so that it might\r\nnot continue to be a stumbling-block in reopening the negotiations.\r\nThe Great Powers were willing to act as mediators, but could not make\r\nany acceptable overture until after the fall of Janina and Adrianople.\r\n\r\nOn March 23d, they proposed the following as basis for the renewal of\r\nthe negotiations at London:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"1. A frontier line from Enos to Midia, which would follow the course\r\nof the Maritza, and the cession to the Allies of all the territories\r\nwest of that line, with the exception of Albania, whose status and\r\nfrontiers would be decided upon by the Powers.\r\n\r\n\"2. Decision by the Powers of the question of the Ægean Islands.\r\n\r\n\"3. Abandonment of Crete by Turkey.\r\n\r\n\"4. Arrangement of all financial questions at Paris, by an\r\ninternational commission, in which the representatives of Turkey and\r\nthe allies would be allowed to sit.  Participation of the allies in the\r\nOttoman Debt, and in the financial obligations of the territories newly\r\nacquired.  No indemnity of war, in principle.\r\n\r\n\"5. End of hostilities immediately after the acceptance of this basis\r\nof negotiations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n{317}\r\n\r\nTurkey agreed to these stipulations.  The Balkan States, however, did\r\nnot want to commit themselves to the Enos-Midia line \"as definitely\r\nagreed upon,\" but only as a base of _pourparlers_.  They insisted that\r\nthe Ægean Islands must be ceded directly to them.  They wanted to know\r\nwhat the Powers had in mind in regard to the frontiers of Albania.  In\r\nthe last place, they refused to relinquish the possibility of an\r\nindemnity of war.\r\n\r\nNotes were exchanged back and forth among the chancelleries until April\r\n20th, when the Balkan States finally agreed to accept the mediation of\r\nthe Powers.  They had practically carried all their points, however,\r\nexcept that of the communication of the Albanian frontier.  Hostilities\r\nceased.  There really was not much more to fight about, at least as far\r\nas Turkey was concerned.\r\n\r\nIt was a whole month before the second conference at London opened.\r\nThe only gleam of hope that the Turks were justified in entertaining,\r\nwhen they decided to renew the war, had been the possible outbreak of a\r\nwar between the Allies.  If only the quarrel over Macedonia had come,\r\nfor which they looked from week to week, they might have been able to\r\nput pressure on Bulgaria for the return of Adrianople, and on Greece\r\nfor the return of the Ægean Islands.  But the rupture between the\r\nAllies did not take place until after they had settled with Turkey.\r\nWhy fight over the bear's skin until it was actually in their hands?\r\n\r\nThe negotiations were reopened in London on May 20th.  On May 30th, the\r\npeace preliminaries {318} were signed.  The Sultan of Turkey ceded to\r\nthe Kings of the allied states his dominions in Europe beyond the\r\nEnos-Midia line.  Albania, its status and frontiers, were intrusted by\r\nthe Sultan to the sovereigns of the Great Powers.  He ceded Crete to\r\nthe allied sovereigns, but left the decision as to the islands in the\r\nÆgean Sea, and the status of Mount Athos, to the Great Powers.\r\n\r\nThe war between the allies enabled Turkey to violate this treaty.  They\r\nwon back from Bulgaria, without opposition, most of Thrace, including\r\nAdrianople and Kirk Kilissé.  Later, treaties were made separately with\r\neach of the Balkan States.  But, as it seems to be a principle of\r\nhistory that no territories that have once passed from the shadow of\r\nthe Crescent return, it is probable that the Treaty of London will, in\r\nthe end, represent the _minimum_ of what Turkey's former subjects have\r\nwrested from her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{319}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE RUPTURE BETWEEN THE ALLIES\r\n\r\nTo those who knew the centuries-old hatred and race rivalry between\r\nGreece and Servia and Bulgaria in the Balkan Peninsula, an alliance for\r\nthe purpose of liberating Macedonia seemed impossible.  The Ottoman\r\nGovernment had a sense of security which seemed to be justifiable.\r\nThey had known how to keep alive and intensify racial hatred in\r\nEuropean Turkey, and believed that they were immune from concerted\r\nattack because the Balkan States would never be able to agree as to the\r\ndivision of spoils after a successful war.\r\n\r\nThe history of the ten years of rivalry between bands, which had\r\nnullified the efforts of the Powers to \"reform\" Macedonia by installing\r\na _gendarmerie_ under European control, had taught the diplomats that\r\nthey had working against the pacification of Macedonia not only the\r\nOttoman authorities, but also the native Christian population and the\r\nneighbouring emancipated countries.  They were ready to believe the\r\nastute Hussein Hilmy pasha, Vali of Macedonia, when he said: \"I am\r\nruling over an insane asylum.  Were the Turkish flag withdrawn, {320}\r\nthey would fly at each other's throats, and instead of reform, you\r\nwould have anarchy.\"\r\n\r\nIf the Balkan States had realized how completely and how easily they\r\nwere going to overthrow the military power of Turkey, they probably\r\nwould not have attempted it.  This seems paradoxical, but it is true\r\nall the same.\r\n\r\nThe Allies did not anticipate more than the holding of the Ottoman\r\nforces in check and the occupation of the frontiers and of the upper\r\nvalleys of the Vardar and Struma.  Greece felt that she would be\r\nrewarded by a slight rectification of boundary in Thessaly and Epirus,\r\nif only the war would settle the status of Crete and result in an\r\nautonomous _régime_ for the Ægean Islands.  At the most, the Balkan\r\nStates hoped to force upon Turkey the autonomy of Macedonia under a\r\nChristian governor.  So jealous was each of the possibility of\r\nanother's gaining control of Macedonia that this solution would have\r\nsatisfied them more than the complete disappearance of Turkish rule.\r\nBoth hopes and fears as to Macedonia were envisaged rather in\r\nconnection with each other than in connection with the Turks.\r\n\r\nBetween Servia and Bulgaria there was a definite treaty, signed on\r\nMarch 13, 1912, which defined future spheres of influence in upper\r\nMacedonia.  But Greece had no agreement either with Bulgaria or Servia.\r\n\r\nThe events of October, 1912, astonished the whole world.  No such\r\nsudden and complete collapse of the Ottoman power in Europe was dreamed\r\nof.  I {321} have already spoken of how fearful the European\r\nChancelleries were of an Ottoman victory.  Had they not been so morally\r\ncertain of Turkey's triumph they would never have sent to the\r\nbelligerents their famous--and in the light of subsequent events\r\nridiculous--joint note concerning the _status quo_.\r\n\r\nBut if the Great Powers were unprepared for the succession of Balkan\r\ntriumphs, the allies were much more astonished at what they were able\r\nto accomplish.  Kirk Kilissé and Lulé Burgas gave Thrace to Bulgaria.\r\nKumanovo opened up the valley of the Vardar to the Servians, while the\r\nGreeks marched straight to Salonika without serious opposition.\r\n\r\nThe victories of the Servians and Greeks, so easily won, were to the\r\nBulgarians a calamity which overshadowed their own striking military\r\nsuccesses.  They had spilled much blood and wasted their strength in\r\nthe conquest of Thrace which they did not want, while their allies--but\r\nrivals for all that--were in possession of Macedonia, the _Bulgaria\r\nirredenta_.  To be encircling Adrianople and besieging Constantinople,\r\ncities in which they had only secondary interest, while the Servians\r\nattacked Monastir and the Greeks were settling themselves comfortably\r\nin Salonika, was the irony of fate for those who felt that others were\r\nreaping the fruits for which they had made so great and so admirable a\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to judge dispassionately the folly of Bulgaria in\r\nprovoking a war with her comrades in arms, and the seemingly amazing\r\ngreed for land which it revealed, we must remember that the Bulgarians\r\nfelt that they had accomplished everything {322} to receive nothing.\r\nSalonika and not Adrianople was the city of their dreams.  Macedonia\r\nand not Thrace was the country which they had taken arms to liberate.\r\nThe Ægean Sea and not the extension of their Black Sea littoral formed\r\nthe substantial and logical economic background to the appeal of race\r\nwhich led them to insist so strongly in gathering under their\r\nsovereignty all the elements of the Bulgarian people.  European writers\r\nhave not been able to understand how little importance the Bulgarians\r\nattached to their territorial acquisitions in Thrace, and of how little\r\ninterest it was for them to acquire new possessions in which there were\r\nso few Bulgarians.\r\n\r\nThen, too, the powerful elements which had pushed Bulgaria into the war\r\nwith Turkey, and had contributed so greatly to her successes, were of\r\nMacedonian origin.  In Sofia, the Macedonians are numerically, as well\r\nas financially and politically, very strong.  I had a revelation of\r\nthis, such as the compilation of statistics cannot give, on the day\r\nafter the massacre of Kotchana.  The newspapers called upon all the\r\nMacedonians in Sofia to put out flags tied with crêpe.  In the main\r\nstreets of the city, it seemed as if every second house was that of a\r\nMacedonian.  To these people, ardent and powerful patriots, Macedonia\r\nwas home.  It had been the dream of their lives to unite the regions\r\nfrom which they had come--once emancipated from the Turks--to the\r\nmother country.  From childhood, they had been taught to look towards\r\nthe Rhodope Mountains as the hills from which should come their help.\r\nIs it any wonder then, that, after the striking victories {323} of\r\ntheir arms, there should be a feeling of insanity--for it was\r\nthat--when they saw the dreams of a lifetime about to vanish?\r\n\r\nBut the mischief of the matter, as a Scotchman would say, was that\r\nGreeks and Servians felt the same way about the same places.\r\nPopulations had been mixed for centuries.  At some time or other in\r\npast history each of the three peoples had had successful dynasties to\r\nspread their sovereignty over exactly the same territories.  Each then\r\ncould evoke the same historical memories, each the same past of\r\nsuffering, each the same present of hopes, and the same prayers of the\r\nemancipated towards Sofia and Athens and Belgrade.\r\n\r\nAfter the occupation of Salonika by the Greeks, the Bulgarian ambitions\r\nto break the power of Turkey were not the same as they had been before.\r\nHad Salonika been occupied two weeks earlier, there might not have been\r\na Lulé Burgas.  An armistice was hurriedly concluded.  During the\r\ntrying period of negotiations in London, and during the whole of the\r\nsecond part of the war, the jealousies of the allies had been awakened\r\none against the other.  Between Greeks and Bulgarians, it had been keen\r\nsince the very first moment that the Greek army entered Macedonia.  The\r\ncrisis between Servia and Bulgaria did not become acute until Servia\r\nsaw her way blocked to the Adriatic by the absurd attempt to create a\r\nfree Albania.  Then she naturally began to insist that the treaty of\r\npartition which she had signed with Bulgaria could not be carried out\r\nby her.  In vain she appealed to the sense of justice of the\r\nBulgarians.  {324} The treaty had been signed on the understanding that\r\nAlbania would fall under the sphere of Servian aggrandizement.  Nor, on\r\nthe other hand, had it been contested that Thrace would belong to\r\nBulgaria.  If the treaty were carried out, Bulgaria would get\r\neverything and Servia nothing.  Servia also reminded the Bulgarians of\r\nthe loyal aid that had been given them in the reduction of Adrianople.\r\nBut Bulgaria held to her pound of flesh.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances of the division of territory, Bulgaria's claim\r\nto cross the Vardar and go as far as Monastir and Okrida, would not\r\nonly have given her possession of a fortress from which she could\r\ndominate both Servia and Greece, but would have put another state\r\nbetween Servia and Salonika.  Bulgaria was, in fact, demanding\r\neverything as far as Servia was concerned.  Servia cannot be blamed\r\nthen for coming to an understanding with Greece, even if it were for\r\nsupport in the violation of a treaty.  For where does history give us\r\nthe example of a nation holding to a treaty when it was against her\r\ninterest to do so?\r\n\r\nAfter their return from London, the Premiers Venizelos and Pasitch made\r\nan offensive and defensive alliance for ten years against the Bulgarian\r\naspirations.  In this alliance, concluded at Athens shortly after King\r\nGeorge's death, the frontiers were definitely settled.  In the\r\nnegotiations, Greece showed the same desire to have everything for\r\nherself which Bulgaria was displaying.  Finally she agreed to allow\r\nServia to keep Monastir.  Without this concession, Servia would have\r\nfared as badly {325} at the hands of Greece as at the hands of\r\nBulgaria.  It is only because Greece feared that Servia might be driven\r\nto combine with Bulgaria against her, that the frontier in this\r\nagreement was drawn south of Monastir.  The Greek army officers opposed\r\nstrongly this concession, but Venizelos was wise enough to see that the\r\nmaintenance of Greek claims to Monastir might result in the loss of\r\nSalonika.  The Serbo-Greek alliance was not made public until the\r\nmiddle of June.  Bulgaria had also been making overtures to Greece, and\r\nat the end of May had expressed her willingness to waive her claim to\r\nSalonika in return for Greek support against Servia.  Venizelos,\r\nalready bound to Servia, was honourable enough to refuse this\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\nBut the military reputation of Bulgaria was still so strong in\r\nBulgarian diplomacy that Servia and Greece were anxious to arrive, if\r\npossible, at an arrangement without war.  Venizelos proposed a meeting\r\nat Salonika.  Bulgaria declined.  Then Venizelos and Pasitch together\r\nproposed the arbitration of the Czar.  Bulgaria at the first seemed to\r\nreceive this proposition favourably, but stipulated that it would be\r\nonly for the disputed matter in her treaty with Servia.  At this\r\nmoment, the Russian Czar sent a moving appeal to the Balkan States to\r\navoid the horrors of a fratricidal war.  Bulgaria then agreed to send,\r\ntogether with her Allies, delegates to a conference at Petrograd.\r\n\r\nAll the while, Premier Gueshoff of Bulgaria had been struggling for\r\npeace against the pressure and the intrigues of the Macedonian party at\r\nSofia.  {326} They looked upon the idea of a Petrograd conference as\r\nthe betrayal of Macedonians and Bulgarians by the mother country.\r\nUnable to maintain his position, Gueshoff resigned.  His withdrawal\r\nruined Bulgaria, for he was replaced by M. Daneff, who was heart and\r\nsoul with the Macedonian party.  A period of waiting followed.  But\r\nfrom this moment war seemed inevitable to those who knew the feeling on\r\nboth sides.  Daneff and his friends did not hesitate.  They would not\r\nlisten to reason.  They believed that they had the power to force\r\nGreece and Servia to a peace very nearly on their own terms.  Public\r\nopinion was behind them, for news was continually coming to Sofia of\r\nGreek and Servian oppression of Bulgarians in the region between\r\nMonastir and Salonika.  These stories of unspeakable cruelty, which\r\nwere afterwards established to be true by the Carnegie Commission, had\r\nmuch to do with making possible the second war.\r\n\r\nIt was not difficult for the Macedonian party at Sofia to precipitate\r\nhostilities.  The Bulgarian general staff, in spite of the caution that\r\nshould have imposed itself upon them by the consideration of the\r\nexhausting campaign in the winter, felt certain of their ability to\r\ndefeat the Servians and Greeks combined.  Then, too, the army on the\r\nfrontiers, in which there was a large element--perhaps twenty per\r\ncent.--of Macedonians, had already engaged in serious conflicts with\r\nthe Greeks.\r\n\r\nIn fact, frontier skirmishes had begun in April.  The affair of Nigrita\r\nwas really a battle.  After these outbreaks, Bulgarian and Greek\r\nofficers had {327} been compelled to establish a neutral zone in order\r\nto prevent the new war from beginning of itself.  At the end of May,\r\nthere had been fighting in the Panghaeon district, east of the river\r\nStrymon.  The Bulgarian staff had wanted to prevent the Greeks from\r\nbeing in a position to cut the railway from Serres to Drama.  In the\r\nbeginning of June, Bulgarian coast patrols had fired on the _Averoff_.\r\nBy the end of June, the Bulgarian outposts were not far from Salonika.\r\n\r\nThe first Bulgarian plan was to seize suddenly Salonika, which would\r\nthus cut off the Greek army from its base of supplies and its\r\nadvantageous communication by sea with Greece.  There were nearly one\r\nthousand five hundred Bulgarian soldiers in Salonika under the command\r\nof General Hassapsieff.  How many _comitadjis_ had been introduced into\r\nthe city no one knows.  I was there during the last week of June, and\r\nsaw many Bulgarian peasants, big strapping fellows, who seemed to have\r\nno occupation.  When I visited the Bulgarian company, which was\r\nquartered in the historic mosque of St. Sophia, two days before their\r\ndestruction, they seemed to me to be absolutely sure of their position.\r\nAt this moment, the atmosphere among the few Bulgarians in Salonika was\r\nthat of complete confidence.\r\n\r\nAmong the Greeks, a spirit of excitement and of apprehension made them\r\nrealize the gravity and the dangers of the events which were so soon to\r\nfollow.  Perfect confidence, while highly recommended by the theorists,\r\ndoes not seem to win wars.  Nervousness, {328} on the other hand, makes\r\nan army alert, and ready to exert all the greater effort, from the fact\r\nthat it feels it needs that effort.  In all the wars with which this\r\nbook deals this has been true,--Italian confidence in 1911, Turkish\r\nconfidence in 1912, Bulgarian confidence in 1913, and German confidence\r\nin 1914.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of June, when I left Salonika to go to Albania, it was the\r\nopinion of the Greek officers in Salonika that the war--which they\r\nviewed with apprehension--would be averted by the conference at\r\nPetrograd.  When I got on my steamship, the first man I met was\r\nSandansky, who had become famous a decade before by the capture of Miss\r\nStone, an American missionary.  He had embarked on this Austrian Lloyd\r\nsteamer at Kavalla, with the expectation of slipping ashore at\r\nSalonika, if possible, to prepare the way for the triumphal entry of\r\nthe Bulgarian army.  But he was only able to look sorrowfully out on\r\nthe city, for the police were waiting to arrest him.  What bitter\r\nthoughts he must have had when he saw the Bulgarian flag, which he had\r\nplanted there with his own hands, waving from the minaret of St.\r\nSophia, and he unable to organize its defence!  A week later I saw\r\nSandansky at a café in Valona.  The war had then started, and he was\r\nprobably trying to persuade the Albanians to enter the struggle and to\r\ntake the Servians in the rear.\r\n\r\n{330}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE WAR BETWEEN THE BALKAN ALLIES\r\n\r\nOn Sunday night, June 29th, without any declaration of war or even\r\nwarning, General Savoff ordered a general attack all along the Greek\r\nand Servian lines.  There was no direct provocation on the part of\r\nBulgaria's allies.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility for precipitating the war which brought about the\r\nhumiliation of Bulgaria can be directly fixed.  Two general orders,\r\ndated from the military headquarters at Sofia on June 29th, have been\r\npublished.  They set forth an amazing and devilish scheme, which stands\r\nout as a most cold and bloody calculation, even among all the horrors\r\nof Balkan history.  General Savoff stated positively that this\r\nenergetic action was not the commencement of a war.  It was merely for\r\nthe purpose of occupying as much territory as possible in the contested\r\nregions before the intervention of the Powers.  It had a two-fold\r\nobject: to cut the communications between the Greeks and Servians at\r\nVeles (Küprülü) on the Vardar, and to throw an army suddenly into\r\nSalonika.  The fighting began in the night-time.  The Bulgarians\r\nnaturally were able to advance into a number of important positions.\r\n\r\n{331}\r\n\r\nWhen the news became known at Salonika on the morning of the 30th,\r\nGeneral Hassapsieff, on the ground that he was a diplomatic agent, was\r\nallowed to leave.  Before his departure he gave an order to his forces\r\nto resist, if they were attacked, as he would return with the Bulgarian\r\narmy in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nEarly in the afternoon the Greeks sent an ultimatum ordering the\r\nBulgarians in Salonika to surrender by six o'clock.  Their refusal led\r\nto all-night street fighting.  Barricaded in St. Sophia and several\r\nother buildings, they were able to defend themselves until the Greeks\r\nturned artillery upon their places of refuge.  Not many were killed on\r\neither side.  Salonika was calm again the next day.  One thousand three\r\nhundred Bulgarian soldiers and a number of prominent Bulgarian\r\nresidents of Salonika, under conditions of exceptional cruelty and\r\nbarbarism, were sent to Crete.  The Greek forces in Salonika, among\r\nwhom were some twenty thousand from America, were hurried to the\r\noutposts for the defence of the city.\r\n\r\nThere was no diplomatic action following the treachery of the\r\nBulgarians towards their allies.  The Greek Foreign Minister stated\r\nthat Greece considered the Bulgarian attack an act of war, and that the\r\nGreek army had been ordered to advance immediately to retake the\r\npositions which the Bulgarians had captured.  Nor did Servia show any\r\ndisposition to treat with Bulgaria.  No official communications reached\r\nSofia from a Great Power.  There had been a miscalculation.  Bulgaria\r\nwas {332} compelled, as a consequence of her ill-considered act, to\r\nface a new war.  There was no withdrawal possible.\r\n\r\nFrom a purely military point of view, it seems hard to believe that the\r\nBulgarians really thought that their night attack would bring about\r\nwar.  Their army had borne the brunt of the campaign against the Turks,\r\nand had suffered terribly during the winter spent in the trenches\r\nbefore Tchatalja.  They were not in a good strategic position, for the\r\narmy was spread out over a long line, and the character of the country\r\nmade concentration difficult.  Adequate railway communication with the\r\nbases of supplies was lacking.  The Greeks and Servians, on the other\r\nhand, held not only the railway from Salonika to Nish through the\r\nvalley of the Vardar, but even were it successfully cut, had\r\ncommunication by railway with their bases at Salonika, Monastir,\r\nMitrovitza, Uskub, and Nish.\r\n\r\nGeneral Ivanoff, in command of the second Bulgarian army, was charged\r\nwith confronting the whole of the Greek forces, in a line passing from\r\nthe Ægean Sea to Demir-Hissar on the Vardar, between Serres and\r\nSalonika.  When we realize that General Ivanoff had less than fifty\r\nthousand men, a portion of whom were recruits from the region of\r\nSerres, and that he had to guard against an attack on his right flank\r\nfrom the Servians, we cannot help wondering what the Bulgarian general\r\nstaff had counted upon in provoking their allies to battle.  Did they\r\nexpect that the Greeks and Servians would be intimidated by the night\r\nattack of June 29th, and would {333} agree to continue the project of a\r\nconference at Petrograd?  Or did they think that the Greek army was of\r\nso little value that they could brush it aside, and enter Salonika,\r\njust as the Greeks had been able to enter in November?  Whatever\r\nhypothesis we adopt, it shows contempt for their opponents and belief\r\nin their own star.  The proof of the fact that the Bulgarians never\r\ndreamed of anything but the success of their \"bluff,\" or, if there was\r\nresistance, of an easy victory, is found in the few troops at the\r\ndisposal of General Ivanoff, and in the choice of Doiran, so near the\r\nfront of battle, as the base of supplies.  At Doiran everything that\r\nthe second army needed in provisions and munitions of war was stored.\r\nFrom the financial standpoint alone, Bulgaria could not afford to risk\r\nthe loss of these supplies.\r\n\r\nOn July 2d, the Greek army, under the command of Crown Prince\r\nConstantine, took the offensive against the Bulgarians, who had\r\noccupied on the previous day the crest of Beshikdag, from the mouth of\r\nthe Struma to the plateau of Lahana, across the road from Salonika to\r\nSerres, and the heights north of Lake Ardzan, commanding the left bank\r\nof the Vardar.  The positions were strong.  If the Greek army had been\r\nof the calibre that the Bulgarians evidently expected, or if General\r\nIvanoff had had sufficient forces to hold the positions against the\r\nGreek attack, there would undoubtedly have been _pourparlers_, and a\r\nprobable cessation of hostilities just as the Bulgarians counted upon.\r\n\r\nBut the Greeks soon proved that they were as brave and as determined as\r\ntheir opponents.  Their {334} artillery fire was excellent.  There was\r\nno wavering before the deadly resistance of the entrenched Bulgarians.\r\nAfter five days of struggle, in which both sides showed equal courage,\r\nthe forces of General Ivanoff yielded to superior numbers.  The\r\nBulgarians were compelled to retreat, on July 6th, in two columns,\r\ntowards Demir-Hissar and Strumitza.  The retreat was effected in good\r\norder, and the Greeks, though in possession of mobile artillery, could\r\nnot surround either column.  Victory had been purchased at a terrible\r\nprice.  The Greek losses in five days were greater than during the\r\nwhole war with Turkey.  They admitted ten thousand _hors du combat_.\r\nThe Greeks had received their first serious baptism of fire, and had\r\ndemonstrated that they could fight.  The Turks had never given them the\r\nopportunity to wipe out the disgrace of 1897.\r\n\r\nIt is a tribute to the quickness of decision of the Crown Prince\r\nConstantine and his general staff, and to the spirit of his soldiers,\r\nthat this severe trial of five days of continuous fighting and fearful\r\nloss of life was not followed by a respite.  The Greek headquarters\r\nwere moved to Doiran on the 7th.  It was decided to maintain the\r\noffensive as long as the army had strength to march and men to fill the\r\ngaps made by the fall of thousands every day.  The Bulgarians, although\r\nthey contested desperately every step, were kept on the move.  On the\r\nright, the Greeks pushed through to Serres, joining there, on July\r\n11th, the advance-guard of the detachments which the Greek fleet had\r\nlanded at Kavalla on the 9th.\r\n\r\n{335}\r\n\r\nThe advance of the Greek armies was along the Vardar, the Struma, and\r\nthe Mesta.  On the Vardar, the Bulgarian abandonment of Demir-Hissar,\r\non the 10th, enabled the Greeks to repair the railway, and establish\r\ncommunication with the Servian army.  The right wing, advancing by the\r\nMesta, occupied Drama.  On July 19th, the Bulgarian resistance was\r\nconcentrated at Nevrokop.  When it broke here, the Greek right wing was\r\nable to send its outposts to the foothills of the Rhodope Mountains, on\r\nthe Bulgarian frontier.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks began to speak of the invasion of Bulgaria, and of making\r\npeace at Sofia.  But the bulk of their forces met an invincible\r\nresistance at Simitli.  From the 23d to the 26th, they attacked the\r\nBulgarian positions, and believed that the advantage was theirs.  But\r\non the 27th the Bulgarians began a counter-attack against both wings of\r\nthe Greek army at once.  On the 29th, the Greeks began to plan their\r\nretreat.  On the 30th, they realized that the retreat was no longer\r\npossible.  The Bulgarians were on both their flanks.  It was then that\r\nthe armistice saved them.\r\n\r\nWhile the Greek army was gaining its victories in the _hinterland_ of\r\nMacedonia, the ports of the Ægean coast, Kavalla, Makri, Porto-Lagos,\r\nand Dedeagatch were occupied without resistance by the Greek fleet.\r\nDetachments withdrawn from Epirus were brought to these ports.  Some\r\nwent to Serres and Drama.  Others garrisoned the ports, and occupied\r\nXanthi and other nearby inland towns.\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarians may have had some reason to {336} discount the value of\r\nthe Greek army.  For it had not yet been tried.  But the Servians had\r\nshown from the very first day of the war with Turkey that they\r\npossessed high military qualities.  The courage of their troops was\r\ncoupled with agility.  They had had more experience than the Bulgarians\r\nand Greeks in quick marches, and in breaking up their forces into\r\nnumerous columns.  There is probably no army in Europe to-day which can\r\nequal the Servians in mobility.  It is incredible that the Bulgarians\r\ncould have hoped to surprise the Servians, and find a weak place\r\nanywhere along their lines.  On the defensive, in localities which they\r\nhad come to know intimately by nine months in the field, it would have\r\ntaken a larger force than the Bulgarians could muster to get the better\r\nof soldiers such as the Servians had proved themselves to be.\r\n\r\nWhether it was by scorn for the Greeks, or by appreciation of the\r\nServian concentration, the Bulgarians had planned to confront the\r\nServians with four of their five armies.  We have already seen that\r\nGeneral Ivanoff had the second army alone to oppose to the Greeks, and\r\nthat even a few battalions of his troops were needed on the Servian\r\nflank.\r\n\r\nThe engagements between the Bulgarians and the Servians had two\r\ndistinct fields of action, one in Macedonia, and the other on the\r\nBulgaro-Servian frontier.\r\n\r\nIn Macedonia, the Bulgarians experienced the same surprise in regard to\r\nthe Servians as in regard to the Greeks.  Their sudden attack of June\r\n30th did not strike terror to the hearts of their opponents.  {337}\r\nInstead of gaining for them a favourable diplomatic position, they\r\nfound that the Servians did not even suggest a parley.  On July 1st,\r\nthe Servians started a counter-attack, and kept a steady offensive\r\nagainst their former allies for eight days.  Gradually the Bulgarians,\r\nalong the Bregalnitza, gave ground, retreating from position to\r\nposition, always with their face towards the enemy.  The battle, after\r\nthe first day, was for the Bulgarians a defensive action all along the\r\nline.\r\n\r\nOn July 4th, General Dimitrieff assumed the functions of generalissimo\r\nof the Bulgarian forces.  He tried his best to check the Servian\r\noffensive.  But the aggressive spirit had gone out of the Bulgarian\r\narmy.  Lulé Burgas could not be repeated.  It was incapable of more\r\nthan a stubborn resistance to the Servian advance.  By July 8th, the\r\nServians were masters of the approaches to Istip, and had cleared the\r\nBulgarians out of the territory which led down into the valley of the\r\nVardar.  Then they stopped.  From this time on to the signing of the\r\narmistice, the Macedonian Servian army was content with the victories\r\nof the first week.\r\n\r\nAlong the Servian-Bulgarian frontier, the Bulgarian army had some\r\ninitial success.  But General Kutincheff did not dispose of enough men\r\nto make possible a successful aggressive movement towards Nish.  From\r\nthe very first, when the Macedonian army failed to advance, the\r\nBulgarian plans for an invasion of Servia fell to the ground.  They had\r\nbased everything upon an advance in Macedonia to the Vardar.  So the\r\nforward movement wavered.  {338} The Servians, now sure of Rumanian\r\nco-operation, advanced in turn towards Widin.  General Kutincheff was\r\ncompelled to fall back on Sofia by the Rumanian invasion.  Widin was\r\ninvested by the Servians on July 23d.\r\n\r\nRumania had watched with alarm the rise of the military power of\r\nBulgaria.  She could not intervene in the first Balkan war on the side\r\nof the Turks.  The civilized world would not have countenanced such a\r\nmove, nor would it have had the support of Rumanian public opinion.\r\nWhatever the menace of Bulgarian hegemony in the Balkan Peninsula,\r\nRumania had to wait until peace had been signed between the allies and\r\nthe Turks.  But, as we have already seen, during the first negotiations\r\nat London, her Minister to Great Britain had been instructed to treat\r\nwith Bulgaria for a cession of territory from the Danube at Silistria\r\nto the Black Sea, in order that Rumania might have the strategic\r\nfrontier which the Congress of Berlin ought to have given her, when the\r\nDobrudja was awarded to her, without her consent, in exchange for\r\nBessarabia.  As Rumania had helped to free Bulgaria in 1877-78, and had\r\nnever received any reward for her great sacrifices, while the\r\nBulgarians had done little to win their own independence, the demand of\r\na rectification of frontier was historically reasonable.  Since Rumania\r\nhad so admirably developed the Dobrudja, and had constructed the port\r\nof Constanza, it was justified from the economic standpoint.  For the\r\npossession of Silivria, and a change of frontier on the Dobrudja, was\r\nthe only means by which Rumania {339} could hope to defend her southern\r\nfrontier from attack.\r\n\r\nAt first, the Bulgarians bitterly opposed any compensation to Rumania.\r\nThey discounted the importance of her neutrality, for they knew that\r\nshe could not act against them as long as they were at war with Turkey.\r\nThey denounced the demands of Rumania, perfectly reasonable as they\r\nwere, as \"blackmail.\"  They were too blinded with the dazzling glory of\r\ntheir unexpected victories against the Turks to realize how essential\r\nthe friendship of Rumania--at least, the neutrality of Rumania--was to\r\ntheir schemes for taking all Macedonia to themselves.  When, in April,\r\nthey signed with very ill grace the cession of Silivria, as a\r\ncompromise, and refused to yield the small strip of territory from\r\nSilivria to Kavarna on the Black Sea, the Bulgarians made a fatal\r\npolitical mistake.  It was madness enough to go into the second Balkan\r\nwar in the belief that they could frighten, or, if that failed,\r\noverwhelm the Servians and Greeks.  What shall we call the failure to\r\ntake into their political calculations the possibility of a Rumanian\r\nintervention?  Even if there were not the question of the frontier in\r\nthe Dobrudja, would not Rumanian intervention still be justified by the\r\nconsideration of preserving the balance of power in the Balkans?  By\r\nintervening, Rumania would be acting, in her small corner of the world,\r\njust as the larger nations of Europe had acted time and again since the\r\nsixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe Rumanian mobilization commenced on July {340} 3d.  On July 10th,\r\nRumania declared war, and crossed the Danube.  The Bulgarians decided\r\nthat they would not oppose the Rumanian invasion.  How could they?\r\nAlready their armies were on the defensive, and hard pressed, by Greeks\r\nand Servians.  There is a limit to what a few hundred thousand men\r\ncould do.  It is possible, though not probable, that the Bulgarian\r\narmies might have gained the upper hand in the end against their former\r\nallies in Macedonia.  But with Rumania bringing into the field a fresh\r\narmy, larger than that of any other Balkan States, Bulgaria's case was\r\nhopeless.  The Rumanians advanced without opposition, and began to\r\nmarch upon Sofia.  They occupied, on July 15th, the seaport of Varna,\r\nfrom which the Bulgarian fleet had withdrawn to Sebastopol.\r\n\r\nIt would have been easy for the Rumanians to have occupied Sofia, and\r\nwaited there for the Servian and Greek armies to arrive.  The\r\nhumiliation of Bulgaria could have been made complete.  Why, then, the\r\narmistice of July 30th?  Why the assembling hastily of a peace\r\nconference at Bukarest?  Political and financial, as well as military,\r\nconsiderations dictated the wisdom of granting to Bulgaria an armistice.\r\n\r\nGreece and Servia were exhausted financially, and their armies could\r\ngain little more than glory by continuing the war.  The Greek army, in\r\nfact, was in a critical position, and ran the risk of being surrounded\r\nand crushed by the Bulgarians.  The Servians had not shown much hurry\r\nto come to the aid of the Greeks.  The truth of the matter is that,\r\n{341} after the battle of the Bregalnitza, which ended on July 10th,\r\nthe Servians began to get very nervous about the successes of their\r\nGreek allies.  They knew well the Greek character, and feared that too\r\neasy victories over the Bulgarians might necessitate a third war with\r\nGreece over Monastir.  So, on July 11th, with the ostensible reason\r\nthat such a measure was necessary to protect their rear against the\r\nAlbanians, the Servian general staff withdrew from the front a number\r\nof the best regiments, and placed them in a position where they could\r\nact, if the Greeks tried to seize Monastir.  On the other hand, Rumania\r\ngave both Greece and Servia to understand that she had entered the war,\r\nnot from any altruistic desire to help them, but for her own interests.\r\nTo see Bulgaria too greatly humiliated and weakened was decidedly no\r\nmore to the interest of Rumania than to see her triumphant.\r\n\r\nAs for Montenegro, she had entered the second Balkan war to give loyal\r\nsupport to Servia, from whom she expected in return a generous spirit\r\nin dividing the _sandjak_ of Novi Bazar.  Her co-operation, however, as\r\nI am able to state from having been in Cettinje when the decision was\r\ntaken to send ten thousand men against Bulgaria, was not made the\r\nsubject of any bargain.  So, when Servia thought best to sign the\r\narmistice, Montenegro was in thorough accord.\r\n\r\nAfter a month of fighting, in which the losses had been far greater\r\nthan during the war with Turkey, and the treatment of non-combatants by\r\nall the armies horrible beyond description, the scene of {342} battle\r\nshifted from the blood-stained mountains and valleys of Macedonia to\r\nthe council chamber at Bukarest.  Rumania was to preside over a Balkan\r\nCongress of Berlin!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{343}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE TREATY OF BUKAREST\r\n\r\nWhen the delegates from the various important capitals reached Bukarest\r\non July 30th, the armies were still fighting.  Everyone, however,\r\nseemed anxious to come to an understanding as soon as possible.  The\r\nfirst session of the delegates was held on the afternoon of July 30th.\r\nPremier Pasitch for Servia and Premier Venizelos for Greece were\r\npresent.  But Premier Daneff, who had so wanted the war, did not have\r\nthe manhood to face its consequences.  The Bulgarians were represented\r\nin Bukarest by no outstanding leader, either political or military.\r\nPremier Majoresco of Rumania presided over the conference.  The first\r\nnecessity was the decision for an armistice.  A suspension of arms was\r\nagreed upon to begin upon August 1st at noon.  On August 4th the\r\narmistice was extended for three days to August 8th.\r\n\r\nIn the conference of Bukarest, Bulgaria, naturally, stood by herself.\r\nIt was necessary, if there was to be peace, that her delegates should\r\ncome to an understanding as to the sacrifices she was willing to make\r\nwith each of her neighbours separately.  {344} Consequently the\r\nimportant decisions were made in committee meetings.  The general\r\nassembly of delegates had little else to do than to ratify the\r\nconcessions wrung from Bulgaria in turn by each of the opponents.\r\n\r\nRarely have peace delegates been put in a more painful position than\r\nthe men whom Bulgaria sent to Bukarest.  It will always be an open\r\nquestion as to whether the military situation of Bulgaria on the 31st\r\nof July, as regards Servia and Greece, was retrievable.  But the\r\npresence of a Rumanian army in Bulgaria made absolutely impossible the\r\ncontinuance of the war.  Consequently there was nothing for Bulgaria to\r\ndo but to yield to the demands of Greece and Servia.  The only check\r\nupon the Servian and Greek delegates was the determination of Rumania\r\nnot to see Bulgaria too greatly weakened.  She had entered into line to\r\ngain her bit of territory in the south of the Dobrudja.  But she had\r\nalso in mind the prevention of Bulgarian hegemony in the Balkan\r\nPeninsula, and she did not propose to see this hegemony go elsewhere.\r\nThis explains the favourable terms which Bulgaria received.\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarian and Rumanian delegates quickly agreed upon a frontier to\r\npresent to the meeting of August 4th.  By this, the first of the\r\nprotocols, Bulgaria ceded to Rumania all her territory north of a line\r\nfrom the Danube, above Turtukaia, to the end of the Black Sea, south of\r\nEkrene.  In addition, she bound herself to dismantle the present\r\nfortresses and promised not to construct forts at Rustchuk, Schumla,\r\nand the country between and for twenty kilometres around Baltchik.\r\n\r\n{345}\r\n\r\nOn August 6th, the protocol with Servia was presented.  The Servian\r\nfrontier was to start at a line drawn from the summit of Patarika on\r\nthe old frontier, and to follow the watershed between the Vardar and\r\nthe Struma to the Greek-Bulgarian frontier, with the exception of the\r\nupper valley of the Strumnitza which remained Servian territory.\r\n\r\nThe following day the protocol with Greece was presented.  The\r\nGreek-Bulgarian frontier was to run from the crest of Belashitcha to\r\nthe mouth of the River Mesta on the Ægean Sea.  Bulgaria formally\r\nagreed to waive all pretensions to Crete.  The protocol with the Greeks\r\nwas the only one over which the Bulgarians made a resolute stand.  When\r\nthey signed this protocol, they stated that the accord was only because\r\nthey had taken notice of the notes which Austria-Hungary and Russia\r\npresented to the conference, to the effect that in their ratification\r\nthey would reserve for future discussion the inclusion of Kavalla in\r\nGreek territory.\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarians insisted on a clause guaranteeing autonomy for churches\r\nand schools in the condominium of liberated territories.  Servia\r\nopposed this demand mildly, and Greece strongly.  They were right.  The\r\nquestion of national propaganda through churches and schools had done\r\nmore to arouse and keep alive racial hatred in Macedonia than any other\r\ncause.  If there were to be a lasting peace, nothing could be more\r\nunwise than the continuance of the propaganda which had plunged\r\nMacedonia into such terrible confusion.\r\n\r\nRumania, however, secured in the Treaty of {346} Bukarest from each of\r\nthe States what they had been unwilling to grant each other.  Rumania\r\nimposed upon Bulgaria, Greece, and Servia, the obligation of granting\r\nautonomy to the Kutzo-Wallachian churches, and assent to the creation\r\nof bishoprics subsidized by the Rumanian Government.\r\n\r\nA rather amusing incident occurred on August 5th by the proposition of\r\nthe United States Government through its Minister at Bukarest, that a\r\nprovision be embodied in the treaty according full religious liberties\r\nin transferred territories.  The ignorance of American diplomacy, so\r\nfrequently to be deplored, never made a greater blunder than this.  It\r\nshowed how completely the American State Department and its advisors on\r\nNear Eastern affairs had misunderstood the Macedonian question.  Quite\r\nrightly, the consideration even of this request was rejected as\r\nsuperfluous.  Mr. Venizelos administered a well-deserved rebuke when he\r\nsaid that religious liberty, in the right sense of the word, was\r\nunderstood through the extension of each country's constitution over\r\nthe territories acquired.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written concerning the intrigues of European Powers at\r\nBukarest during the ten days of the conference which made a new map for\r\nthe Balkan Peninsula.  It will be many years, if ever, before these\r\nintrigues are brought to light.  Therefore we cannot discuss the\r\nquestion of the pressure which was brought to bear upon Rumania, upon\r\nBulgaria, and upon Servia and Greece to determine the partition of\r\nterritories.  Germany looked with alarm upon the possibility of a\r\ndurable {347} settlement.  Austria was determined that Bulgaria and\r\nServia should not become reconciled.\r\n\r\nAustria-Hungary and Russia, though for different reasons, were right in\r\ntheir attitude toward the matter of Greece's claim upon Kavalla.\r\nGreece would have done well had she been content to leave to Bulgaria a\r\nlarger littoral on the Ægean Sea, and the port which is absolutely\r\nessential for the proper economic development of the _hinterland_\r\nattributed to her.  By taking her pound of flesh, the Greeks only\r\nexposed themselves to future dangers.  The laws of economics are\r\ninexorable.  Bulgaria cannot allow herself to think sincerely about\r\npeace until her portion of Macedonia, by the inclusion of Kavalla, is\r\nlogically complete.  It would have been better politics for Greece to\r\nhave shown herself magnanimous on this point.  As George Sand has so\r\naptly said: \"It is not philanthropy, but our own interest, which leads\r\nus sometimes to do good to men in order that they may be prevented in\r\nthe future from doing harm to us.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we come to look back upon the second Balkan war, and have traced\r\nout the sad consequences and the continued unrest which followed the\r\nTreaty of Bukarest, it is possible that Servia's responsibility may be\r\nconsidered as great, if not greater, than that of Bulgaria in bringing\r\nabout the strife between the allies.  In our sympathy with the inherent\r\njustice of Servia's claim for adequate territorial compensation for\r\nwhat she had suffered for, and what she had contributed to, the Turkish\r\n_débâcle_ in Europe, we are apt to overlook three {348} indisputable\r\nfacts: that Servia repudiated a solemn treaty with Bulgaria, on the\r\nbasis of which Bulgaria had agreed to the alliance against Turkey; that\r\nthe territories granted to Servia, _south of the line which she had\r\nsworn not to pass in her territorial claims_, and a portion of those in\r\nthe \"contested zone\" of her treaty with Bulgaria, were beyond any\r\nshadow of doubt inhabited by Bulgarians; and that since these\r\nterritories were ceded to her she has not, as was tacitly understood at\r\nBukarest, extended to them the guarantees and privileges of the Servian\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Bukarest, so far as the disputed territories allotted to\r\nServia are concerned, has created a situation analogous to that of\r\nAlsace and Lorraine after the Treaty of Frankfort.  And Servia started\r\nin to cope with it by following Prussian methods.  What Servians of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and Dalmatia have suffered from Austrian rule,\r\nfree Servia is inflicting upon the Bulgarians who became her subjects\r\nafter the second Balkan war.\r\n\r\nIt would not be an exaggeration to say that the population of\r\nMacedonia, as a whole, of whatever race or creed, would welcome to-day\r\na return to the Ottoman rule of Abdul Hamid.  The Turkish\r\n\"constitutional _régime_\" was worse than Abdul Hamid, the war of\r\n\"liberation\" worse than the Young Turks, and the present disposition of\r\nterritories satisfies none.  Poor Macedonia!\r\n\r\nAfter the disastrous and humiliating losses at Bukarest, Bulgaria still\r\nhad her former vanquished foe to reckon with.  The Turks were again at\r\nAdrianople {349} and Kirk Kilissé.  Thrace was once more in her power.\r\nThe Treaty of Bukarest, while attributing Thrace to Bulgaria on the\r\nbasis of the Treaty of London, actually said nothing whatever about it.\r\nNor were there any promises of aid in helping Bulgaria to get back\r\nagain what she had lost, without a struggle, by her folly and treachery.\r\n\r\nA new war by Bulgaria alone in her weakened military condition and with\r\nher empty treasury, to drive once more the Turks back south of the\r\nEnos-Midia line, was impossible.  Bulgaria appealed to the\r\nchancelleries of Europe to help her in taking possession of the\r\nThracian territory ceded to her at London.  The Powers made one of\r\ntheir futile overtures to Turkey, requesting that she accept the treaty\r\nwhich she had signed a few months before.\r\n\r\nBut no one could blame the Turks for having taken advantage of\r\nBulgarian folly.  Who could expect them to meekly withdraw behind the\r\nEnos-Midia line?  Bulgaria could get no support in applying the\r\nargument of force.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the victors of Lulé Burgas had to go to Constantinople and\r\nmake overtures directly to the Sublime Porte.  They fared very badly.\r\nThe Enos-Midia line was drawn, but it took a curve northward from the\r\nBlack Sea and westward across the Maritza in such a way that the Turks\r\nobtained not only Adrianople, but also Kirk Kilissé and Demotica.  The\r\nBulgarians were not even masters of the one railway leading to\r\nDedeagatch, their sole port on the Ægean Sea.\r\n\r\nThe year 1913 for Bulgaria will remain the most {350} bitter one of her\r\nhistory.  She had to learn the lesson that the life of nations, as well\r\nas of individuals, is one of give as well as take, and that compromise\r\nis the basis of sound statesmanship.  Who wants all, generally gets\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{351}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE ALBANIAN FIASCO\r\n\r\nThe world has not known just what to do with the mountainous country\r\nwhich comes out in a bend on the upper western side of the Balkan\r\nPeninsula directly opposite the heel of Italy.  It caused trouble to\r\nthe Romans from the very moment that they became an extra-Italian\r\npower.  Inherited from them by the Byzantines, fought for with the\r\nvarying fortunes by the Frankish princes, the Venetians, and the Turks,\r\nAlbania has remained a country which cannot be said to have ever been\r\nwholly subjected.  Nor can it be said to have ever had a national\r\nentity.  Its present mediæval condition is due to the fact that, owing\r\nto its high mountains and its being on the road to nowhere, it has not,\r\nsince the Roman days at least, undergone the influences of a\r\ncontemporary civilization.\r\n\r\nVenice recognized the importance of Albania during the days of her\r\ncommercial prosperity.  For the Albanian coast, with its two splendid\r\nharbours, of Valona and Durazzo, effectively guards the entrance of the\r\nAdriatic into the Mediterranean Sea.\r\n\r\nBut Albania did not demand attention a hundred years ago when the last\r\nmap of Europe was being {352} made by the Congress of Vienna.  The\r\nreason for this is simple.  Italy was not a political whole.  The head\r\nof the Adriatic was entirely in the hands of Austria.  There was no\r\nthought at that time of our modern navies, and of the importance of\r\nkeeping open the Straits of Otranto.  It was the Dalmatian coast, north\r\nof Albania, which Austria considered essential to her commercial\r\nsupremacy.  Then, too, Greece had not yet received her freedom, and the\r\nServians had not risen in rebellion against the Ottoman Empire.  There\r\nwere no Slavic, Hellenic, and Italian questions to disturb Austria in\r\nher peaceful possession of the Adriatic Sea.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the union of Italy had been accomplished, and the\r\nsouth Slavic nationalities had formed themselves into political units,\r\nthat Albania became a \"question\" in the chancelleries of Europe.\r\n\r\nAustria-Hungary determined that Italy should not get a foothold in\r\nAlbania.  Italy had the same determination in regard to\r\nAustria-Hungary.  Since the last Russo-Turkish War, Austria-Hungary and\r\nItaly have had the united determination to keep the Slavs from reaching\r\nthe Adriatic.  For the past generation, feeling certain that the end of\r\nthe Ottoman Empire was at hand, Austria and Italy through their\r\nmissionaries, their schools, and their consular and commercial agents,\r\nhave struggled hard against each other to secure the ascendancy in\r\nAlbania.  Their intrigues have not ceased up to this day.\r\n\r\nWhen Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Young Turk\r\noppression of the Albanians aroused the first expression of what might\r\npossibly {353} be called national feeling since the time of Skander\r\nbey's resistance to the Ottoman conquest, the rival Powers, instead of\r\nfollowing in the line of Russia and Great Britain in Persia, and\r\nestablishing spheres of interest, agreed to support the Albanian\r\nnational movement as the best possible check upon Servian and Greek\r\nnational aspirations.  This was the status of Albania in her\r\nrelationship to the Adriatic Powers, when the war of the Balkan States\r\nagainst Turkey broke out.  The accord between Austria and Italy had\r\nstood the strain of Italy's war with Turkey.  Largely owing to their\r\nfear of Russia and to the pressure of Germany, it stood the strain of\r\nthe Balkan War.  But both Italy and Austria let it be known to the\r\nother Powers that if the Turkish Empire in Europe disappeared, there\r\nmust be an independent Albania.\r\n\r\nThis dictum was accepted in principle by the other four Powers, who saw\r\nin it the only possible chance of preventing the outbreak of a conflict\r\nbetween Austria and Russia which would be bound to involve all Europe\r\nin war.  No nation wanted to fight over the question of Albania.\r\nRussia could not hope to have support from Great Britain and France to\r\nimpose upon the Triple Alliance her desire for a Slavic outlet to the\r\nAdriatic.  For neither France nor Great Britain was anxious for the\r\nRussian to get to the Mediterranean.  The accord between the Powers was\r\nshown in the warning given to Greece and Servia that the solution of\r\nthe Albanian question must be reserved for the Powers when a treaty of\r\npeace was signed with Turkey.  The accord weathered {354} the severe\r\ntest put upon it by the bold defiance of the Montenegrin occupation of\r\nScutari.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken elsewhere of the policy of the Young Turks towards\r\nAlbania.  This most useful and loyal corner of the Sultan's dominions\r\nwas turned into a country of perennial revolutions, which started soon\r\nafter the inauguration of the constitutional _régime_.  In the winter\r\nof 1911-1912, when the group of Albanian deputies in the Ottoman\r\nParliament saw their demands for reforms rejected by the Cabinet, and\r\neven the right of discussion of their complaints refused on the floor\r\nof Parliament, the Albanians north and south, Catholic and Moslem,\r\nunited in a resistance to the Turkish authorities that extended to\r\nUskub and Monastir.  After the spring elections of 1912, the resistance\r\nbecame a formidable revolt.  For the Young Turks had rashly manoeuvred\r\nthe balloting with more than Tammany skill.  The Albanians were left\r\nwithout representatives in Parliament!  Former deputies, such as Ismail\r\nKemal bey, Hassan bey, and chiefs such as Isa Boletinatz, Idris Sefer,\r\nand Ali Riza joined in a determination to demand autonomy by force of\r\narms.\r\n\r\nWhen, in July, the Cabinet decided to move an army against the\r\nAlbanians, there were wholesale desertions from the garrison of\r\nMonastir, and of Albanian officers from all parts of European Turkey.\r\nMahmoud Shevket pasha was compelled to resign the Ministry of War, and\r\nwas followed by Saïd pasha and the whole Cabinet.  The Albanians\r\ndemanded as a _sine qua non_ the dissolution of Parliament.  The {355}\r\nMukhtar Cabinet agreed to the dissolution, and accepted almost all the\r\ndemands of the rebels in a conference at Pristina.\r\n\r\nFor the tables had now been turned.  Instead of a Turkish invasion of\r\nAlbania for \"pacification,\" as in previous summers, it was a question\r\nnow of an Albanian invasion of Turkey.  In spite of the conciliatory\r\nspirit of the new Cabinet, the agitation persisted.  It was rumoured\r\nthat the Malissores and the Mirdites were planning a campaign against\r\nScutari and Durazzo.  I was in Uskub in the early part of September.\r\nIsa Boletinatz and his band were practically in possession of the city.\r\nA truce for Ramazan, the Moslem fast month, had been arranged between\r\nTurks and Albanians.  But the Albanians said they would not lay down\r\ntheir arms until a new and honestly constitutional election was held.\r\n\r\nImmediately after Ramazan came the Balkan War.  Albania found herself\r\nseparated from Turkey, and in a position to have more than autonomy\r\nwithout having to deal further with the Turks.\r\n\r\nDuring the Balkan War, the attitude of the Albanians was a tremendous\r\ndisappointment to the Turks.  One marvels that loyalty to the Empire\r\ncould have been expected, even from the Moslem element, in Albania.\r\nAnd yet the Turks did expect that a Pan-Islamic feeling would draw the\r\nAlbanian _beys_ to fight for the Sultan, just as they had expected a\r\nsimilar phenomenon on the part of the rebellious Arabs of the Arabic\r\npeninsula during the war with Italy.\r\n\r\n{356}\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning the Albanians adopted an attitude of\r\nopportunism.  They did not lift a hand directly to help the Turks.  Had\r\nthey so desired, they might have made impossible the investment of\r\nJanina by the Greeks.  But nowhere, save in Scutari, did the Albanians\r\nmake a stubborn stand against the military operations of the Balkan\r\nallies.  Almost from the beginning, they had understood that the Powers\r\nwould not allow the partition of Albania.  They knew that the retention\r\nof Janina was hopeless after the successes of the allies during\r\nOctober.  But they received encouragement from both Austria-Hungary and\r\nItaly to fight for Scutari.\r\n\r\nThe heroic defence of Scutari, which lasted longer than that of any of\r\nthe other fortified towns in the Balkan Peninsula, cannot be regarded\r\nas a feat of the Turkish army.  During the siege, the general\r\ncommanding Scutari had been assassinated by order of Essad pasha, who\r\nwas his second in command.  Essad then assumed charge of the defence as\r\npurely Albanian in character.  He refused to accept the armistice, and\r\ncontinued the struggle throughout the debates in London.  Scutari is at\r\nthe south end of a lake which is shared between Albania and Montenegro.\r\nCommanding the city is a steep barren hill called Tarabosh.  With their\r\nheavy artillery on this hill, the Albanians were able to prevent\r\nindefinitely the capture of their city.  Servians and Montenegrins\r\nfound themselves confronted with the task of taking Tarabosh by\r\nassault, if they hoped to occupy Scutari.  This was a feat beyond the\r\nstrength of a Balkan army.  On the {357} steep slopes of this hill were\r\nplaced miles of barbed wire.  The assailants were mowed down each time\r\nthey tried to reach the batteries at the top.  As Tarabosh commanded\r\nthe four corners of the horizon, its cannon could prevent an assault or\r\nbombardment of the city from the plain.  The allies were unable to\r\nsilence the batteries on the crest of this hill.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter, the principal question before the concert of\r\nEuropean Powers was that of Scutari.  Austria-Hungary was so determined\r\nthat Scutari should not fall into the hands of the Montenegrins and\r\nServians that she mobilized several army corps in Bosnia-Herzegovina\r\nand on the Russian frontier of Galicia, at Christmas time, 1912.  The\r\nNew Year brought with it ominous forebodings for the peace of Europe.\r\nDiplomacy worked busily to bring about an accord between the Powers,\r\nand pressure upon the besiegers of Scutari.  In the middle of March, it\r\nwas unanimously agreed that Scutari should remain to Albania, and that\r\nServia should receive Prizrend, Ipek, Dibra, and Diakova as\r\ncompensation for not reaching the Adriatic, and the assurance of an\r\neconomic outlet for a railroad at some Albanian port.  The European\r\nconcert then decided to demand at Belgrade and Cettinje the lifting of\r\nthe siege of Scutari.\r\n\r\nServia, yielding to the warning of Russia that nothing further could be\r\ndone for her, consented to withdraw her troops from before Scutari, and\r\nto abandon the points in Albanian territory which had been allotted by\r\nthe Powers to the independent Albanian State which they intended to\r\ncreate.  {358} Servia had another reason for doing this.  Seeing the\r\nhopelessness of territorial aggrandizement in Albania, she decided to\r\ndenounce her treaty of partition, concluded before the war, with\r\nBulgaria.  To realize this act of faithlessness and treachery, she had\r\nneed of the sympathetic support of the Powers in the quarrel which was\r\nbound to ensue.  We see here how the blocking of Servia's outlet to the\r\nAdriatic led inevitably to a war between the Balkan Allies.\r\n\r\nBut with Montenegro the situation was entirely different.  She had\r\nsacrificed one-fifth of her army in the attacks upon Tarabosh, and\r\nScutari seemed to her the only thing that she was to get out of the war\r\nwith Turkey.  Perched up in her mountains, there was little harm that\r\nthe Powers could do to her.  Just as King Nicholas had precipitated the\r\nBalkan War against the advice of the Powers the previous October, he\r\ndecided on April 1st to refuse to obey the command of the Powers to\r\nlift the siege of Scutari.  From what I have gathered myself from\r\nconversations in the Montenegrin capital two months later, I feel that\r\nthe King of Montenegro can hardly be condemned for what the newspapers\r\nof Europe called his \"audacious folly\" in refusing to give a favourable\r\nresponse to the joint note presented to him by the European Ministers\r\nat Cettinje.  The Montenegrins are illiterate mountaineers, who know\r\nnothing whatever about considerations of international diplomacy.  If\r\ntheir King had listened to words written on a piece of paper, and had\r\nordered the Montenegrin troops to withdraw from {359} before Scutari,\r\nhe would probably have lost his throne.\r\n\r\nSo the Powers were compelled to make a show of force.  Little\r\nMontenegro, with its one port, and its total population not equal to a\r\nsingle _arrondissement_ of the city of Paris, received the signal\r\nhonour of an international blockade.  On April 7th, an international\r\nfleet, under the command of the British Admiral Burney, blockaded the\r\ncoast from Antivari to Durazzo.  While all Europe was showing its\r\ndispleasure in the Adriatic, the Montenegrins kept on, although\r\ndeserted by the Servians, sitting in a circle around Scutari, only\r\ntwenty-five miles inland from the blockading fleet.  On April 23d,\r\nafter the Balkan War was all finished, Europe was electrified by the\r\nnews that the Albanians had surrendered Scutari to Montenegro.  The\r\nworst was to be feared, for Austria announced her determination to send\r\nher troops across the border from Bosnia into Montenegro.  Such an\r\naction would certainly have brought on a great European war.  For\r\nneither at Rome nor at Petrograd could Austrian intervention have been\r\ntolerated.\r\n\r\nNo Power in Europe was at that moment ready for war.  Largely through\r\npressure brought to bear at Cettinje by his son-in-law, the King of\r\nItaly, King Nicholas decided on May 5th to deliver Scutari to the\r\nPowers.  The Montenegrins withdrew, and ten days later Scutari was\r\noccupied by detachments of marines from the international squadron.\r\nThe blockade was lifted.  The peace of Europe was saved.\r\n\r\n{360}\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of London, signed on May 30, 1913, put Albania into the\r\nhands of the Powers.  The northern and eastern frontiers had been\r\narranged by the promise made to Servia in return for her withdrawal\r\nfrom the siege of Scutari.  But the southern frontier was still an open\r\nquestion.  Here Italy was as much interested as was Austria in the\r\nnorth.  With Corfu in the possession of Greece, Italy would not agree\r\nthat the coast of the mainland opposite should also be Hellenic.  The\r\nGreeks, on the contrary, declared that the littoral and _hinterland_,\r\nup beyond Santi Quaranta, was part of ancient Epirus, and inhabited\r\nprincipally by Greeks.  It should therefore revert logically to greater\r\nGreece.  Athens lifted again the old cry, \"Where there are Hellenes,\r\nthere is Hellas.\"  The Greeks were occupying Santi Quaranta.  They\r\nclaimed as far north as Argyrokastron.  But they consented to withdraw\r\nfrom the Adriatic, north of and opposite Corfu, if interior points\r\nequally far to the north were left to them.  An international\r\ncommission was formed to make a southern boundary for Albania.  Its\r\ntask has is still open.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done with this new state, foster child of all Europe,\r\nwith indefinite boundaries, with guardians each jealous of the other,\r\nand neighbours waiting only for a favourable moment to throw themselves\r\nupon her and extinguish her life?\r\n\r\nI visited Albania in July, 1913, during the second Balkan War.  At\r\nValona, in the south, I found a provisional government,\r\nself-constituted during the {361} previous winter, whose authority was\r\nproblematical outside of Valona itself.  At the head of the government\r\nwas Ismail Kemal, whom I had known as the champion of Albanian autonomy\r\nin the Ottoman Parliament at Constantinople.  He talked passionately of\r\nAlbania, the new State in Europe, with its _united_ population and its\r\n_national_ aspirations.  He was eager to have the claims of Albania to\r\na generous southern frontier presented at London.  He assured me that I\r\ncould write with perfect confidence in glowing terms concerning the\r\nfuture of Albania, that a spirit of harmony reigned throughout the\r\ncountry, and that the Albanians of all creeds, freed from Turkish\r\noppression, were looking eagerly to their new life as an independent\r\nnation.  When I expressed misgivings as to the rôle of Essad pasha, the\r\nprovisional president asserted that the former commander of Scutari was\r\nwholly in accord with him, and cited as proof the fact that he had that\r\nvery day received from Essad pasha his acceptance of the portfolio of\r\nMinister of the Interior.\r\n\r\nBut that indefinable feeling of misgiving, which one always has over\r\nthe enthusiasm of Orientals, caused me to withhold judgment as to the\r\nliability of Albania until I had seen how things were going in other\r\nportions of the new kingdom.\r\n\r\nAt Durazzo, the northern port of Albania, the friends of Essad pasha\r\nwere in control of the government.  Things were still being done _à la\r\nturque_, and there was a feeling of great uncertainty concerning the\r\nfuture.  Few had any faith whatever in the provisional government at\r\nValona, and it was declared {362} that the influence of Essad pasha\r\nwould decide the attitude of the Albanians in Durazzo, Tirana, and\r\nElbassan.  Essad was chief of the Toptanis, the most influential family\r\nin the neighbourhood of Durazzo.  He had \"made his career\" in the\r\n_gendarmerie_, and had risen rapidly through the approval and\r\nadmiration of Abdul Hamid.  This is an indication of his character.  He\r\nwas credited with the ambition of ruling Albania.  To withdraw his\r\nforces and his munitions of war intact, so that he could press these\r\nclaims, is the only explanation of his \"deal\" with King Nicholas of\r\nMontenegro to surrender Scutari.  Essad had sacrificed the pride and\r\nhonour of Albania to his personal ambition.\r\n\r\nFrom Durazzo, I went to San Giovanni di Medua, which was occupied by\r\nthe Montenegrins, just as I had found Santi Quaranta in the south\r\noccupied by the Greeks.  Going inland from this port (one must use his\r\nimagination in calling San Giovanni di Medua a port) by way of Alessio,\r\nI reached Scutari, from whose citadel flew the flags of the Powers.  In\r\nevery quarter of this typically and hopelessly Turkish town, one ran\r\nacross sailors from various nations.  Each Power had its quarter, and\r\nhad named the streets with some curious results.  The Via Garibaldi ran\r\ninto the Platz Radetzky.  On the Catholic cathedral was a sign\r\ninforming you that you were in the Rue Ernest Renan.\r\n\r\nThis accidental naming of streets was a prophecy of the hopelessness of\r\ntrying to reconcile the conflicting aims and ideals of the Powers whose\r\nbands were playing side by side in the public garden.  In {363} the\r\ndining-room of the hotel, when I saw Austrians, Italians, Germans,\r\nBritish, and French officers eating together at the long tables,\r\ninstead of rejoicing at this seeming spirit of European harmony, I had\r\nthe presentiment of the inevitable result of the struggle between Slav\r\nand Teuton, to prevent which these men were there.  Just a year later,\r\nI stood in front of the Gare du Montparnasse in Paris reading the order\r\nfor General Mobilization.  There came back to me as in a dream the\r\npublic garden at Scutari, and the mingled strains of national anthems,\r\nwith officers standing rigidly in salute beside their half-filled\r\nglasses.\r\n\r\nIn the palatial home of a British nobleman who had loved the Albanians\r\nand had lived long in Scutari, Admiral Burney established his\r\nheadquarters.  I talked with him there one afternoon concerning the\r\npresent and the future of Albania, and the relationship of the problem\r\nwhich he had before him with the peace of Europe.  Never have I found a\r\nman more intelligently apprehensive of the possible outcome of the\r\ndrama in which he was playing a part, and at the same time more\r\ndeterminedly hopeful to use all his ability and power to save the peace\r\nof Europe by welding together the Albanians into a nation worthy of the\r\nindependence that has been given to them by the European concert.  Such\r\nmen as Admiral Burney are more than the glory of a nation: they are the\r\nmaking of a nation.  The greatness of Britain is due to the men who\r\nserve her.  High ideals, self-sacrifice, ability, and energy are the\r\ncorner-stones of the British overseas Empire.\r\n\r\n{364}\r\n\r\nThere was little, however, that Admiral Burney, or anyone in fact,\r\ncould do for Albania.  No nation can exist in modern times, when\r\nnational life is in the will of the people rather than in the unifying\r\nqualities of a ruler, if there are no common ideals and the\r\ndetermination to attain them.  Albania is without a national spirit and\r\na national past.  It is, therefore, no unit, capable of being welded\r\ninto a state.  The creation by the Ambassadors of the Powers in London\r\nmay have been thought by them to be a necessity.  But it was really a\r\nmakeshift.  If the Albanians had done their part, and had shown the\r\npossibility of union, the makeshift might have developed into a new\r\nEuropean state.  As things have turned out, it has stayed what it was\r\nin the beginning,--a fiasco.\r\n\r\nAmong the many candidates put forward for the new throne, Prince\r\nWilliam of Wied was finally decided upon.  He was a Protestant, and\r\ncould occupy a position of neutrality among his Moslem, Orthodox, and\r\nCatholic subjects.  He was a German, and could not be suspected of\r\nSlavic sympathies.  He was a relative of the King of Rumania, and could\r\nexpect powerful support in the councils of the Balkan Powers.\r\n\r\nIt would be wearisome to go into the story of Prince William's short\r\nand unhappy reign.  At Durazzo, which was chosen for the capital, he\r\nquickly showed himself incapable of the rôle which a genius among\r\nrulers might have failed to play successfully.  Lost in a maze of\r\nbewildering intrigues, foreign and domestic, the ruler of Albania saw\r\nhis prestige, and {365} then his dignity, disappear.  He never had any\r\nreal authority.  He had been forced upon the Albanians.  They did not\r\nwant him.  The Powers who had placed him upon the throne did not\r\nsupport him.  In the spring, the usual April heading, \"Albania in\r\nArms,\" appeared once more in the newspapers of the world.  Up to the\r\noutbreak of the European war, when Albania was \"lost in the shuffle,\"\r\nalmost daily telegrams detailed the march of the insurgents upon\r\nDurazzo, the useless and fatal heroism of the Dutch officers of the\r\n_gendarmerie_, the incursions of the Epirote bands in the south, and\r\nthe embarrassing position of the international forces still occupying\r\nScutari.  What the Albanians really wanted, none could guess, much less\r\nthey themselves!\r\n\r\nThe European war, in August, 1914, enabled the Powers to withdraw\r\ngracefully from the Albanian fiasco.  Their contingents hurriedly\r\nabandoned Scutari, and sailed for home.  The French did not have time\r\nto do this, so they went to Montenegro.  Since the catastrophe, to\r\nprevent which they had created Albania, had fallen upon Europe, what\r\nfurther need was there for the Powers to bother about the fortunes of\r\nPrince William and his subjects?  Italy alone was left with hands free,\r\nand her interests were not at stake, so long as Greece kept out of the\r\nfray.  For Prince William of Wied, Italy felt no obligation whatever.\r\n\r\nWithout support and without money, there was nothing left to Prince\r\nWilliam but to get out.  He did not have the good sense to make his\r\nwithdrawal from Albania a dignified proceeding.  The palace {366} was\r\nleft under seals.  The Prince issued a proclamation which would lead\r\nthe Albanians to believe that it was his intention to return.  It may\r\nbe that he thought the triumph of the German and Austrian armies in the\r\nEuropean war would mean his re-establishment to Durazzo.  But after he\r\nwas once again safely home at Neu-Wied, he did what he ought to have\r\ndone many months before.  A high-sounding manifesto announced his\r\nabdication, and wished the Albanians Godspeed in the future.  After\r\nthis formality had been accomplished, the former Mpret of Albania\r\nrejoined his regiment in the German army, and went out to fight against\r\nthe French.\r\n\r\nWith Prince William of Wied and the international corps of occupation\r\ngone, the Albanians were left to themselves.  At Durazzo, a body of\r\nnotables, calling themselves the Senate, adopted resolutions restoring\r\nthe Ottoman flag and the suzerainty of the Sultan, invited Prince\r\nBurhaneddin effendi, a son of Abdul Hamid, to become their ruler, and\r\nsolemnly decreed that hereafter the Turkish language should be restored\r\nto its former position as the official language of the country.\r\n\r\nBut Essad pasha thought otherwise.  The psychological moment, for which\r\nhe had been waiting ever since his surrender of Scutari to the\r\nMontenegrins, had come.  In the first week of October, he hurried to\r\nDurazzo with his followers, had himself elected head of a new\r\nprovisional government by the Albanian Senate, and announced openly\r\nthat his policy would be to look to Italy instead of to Austria for\r\nsupport.  After rendering homage to the Sultan as Khalif, {367} asking\r\nthe people to celebrate the happy spirit of harmony which now reigned\r\nthroughout Albania, and prophesying a new era of peace and prosperity\r\nfor Europe's latest-born independent state, the former _gendarme_ of\r\nAbdul Hamid entered the palace, broke the seals of the international\r\ncommission, and went to sleep in the bed of Prince William of Wied.\r\n\r\nOne wonders whether the new ruler of Albania will have more restful\r\nslumbers than his predecessor.  In spite of all protests, Greece is\r\nstill secretly encouraging the Epirotes in their endeavour to push\r\nnorthward the frontier of the Hellenic kingdom.  Italy has two army\r\ncorps at Brindisi waiting for a favourable moment to occupy Valona.\r\nThe Montenegrins and Servians are planning once more to reach the\r\nAdriatic through the valleys of the Boyana and Drin, after they have\r\ndriven the Austro-Hungarian armies from Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Only\r\nan Austrian triumph could now save Albania from her outside enemies.\r\nBut could anything save her from her inside enemies?  When I read of\r\nEssad Pasha in Durazzo, self-chosen Moses of his people, there comes\r\nback to me a conversation with the leading Moslem chieftain of Scutari,\r\nwhose guest I had the privilege of being, in his home in the summer of\r\n1913.  When I mentioned Essad pasha, he rose to his feet before the\r\nfire, waved his arms, and cried out: \"When I see Essad, I shall shoot\r\nhim like a dog!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{368}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN ULTIMATUM TO SERVIA\r\n\r\nIn discussing the relations of the Austrians and Hungarians with their\r\nsouth Slavic subjects, and the rivalries of races in Macedonia the\r\ngeneral causes behind the hostile attitude of Austria-Hungary to the\r\ndevelopment of Servia have been explained.  Specific treatment of the\r\nServian attitude towards the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was\r\nreserved for this chapter, because the events of the summer of 1914 are\r\nthe direct sequence of the events of the winter of 1908-1909.\r\n\r\nOn October 3, 1908, Marquis Pallavicini, Austro-Hungarian Ambassador at\r\nConstantinople, notified verbally the Sublime Porte that\r\nAustria-Hungary had annexed the Turkish provinces of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, whose administration was entrusted to her by the Treaty of\r\nBerlin just thirty years before.  Austria-Hungary was willing to\r\nrenounce the right given her by the Treaty of Berlin to the military\r\noccupation of the _sandjak_ of Novi Bazar (a strip of Turkish territory\r\nbetween Servia and Montenegro), if Turkey would renounce her\r\nsovereignty of the annexed provinces.\r\n\r\n{369}\r\n\r\nThis violation of the Treaty of Berlin by Austria-Hungary aroused a\r\nstrong protest not only in Servia and in Turkey, but also among the\r\nother Powers who had signed at Berlin the conditions of the maintenance\r\nof the integrity of the Ottoman Empire.  The protest was especially\r\nstrong in London and Petrograd.  But Austria-Hungary had the backing of\r\nGermany, whose Ambassador at Petrograd, Count de Pourtales, did not\r\nhesitate several times during the winter to exercise pressure _that\r\nwent almost to the point of being a threat_ upon the Russian Foreign\r\nOffice to refrain from encouraging the intractable attitude of Servia\r\ntowards the annexation.\r\n\r\nWith Germany's support, Austria-Hungary did not have much difficulty in\r\nsilencing the protests of all the Great Powers.  She had a free hand,\r\nthanks to Germany, in forcing Turkey and Servia to accept the _fait\r\naccompli_ of the annexation.\r\n\r\nTurkish protests took the form of the boycott of which we have spoken\r\nelsewhere.  On November 22d, Austria-Hungary threatened to put the\r\nwhole status of European Turkey into question by convoking the European\r\ncongress to revise the Treaty of Berlin.  This is exactly what\r\nAustria-Hungary herself did not want.  But neither did Turkey.  Both\r\ngovernments had a common interest in preventing outside intervention in\r\nthe Balkan Peninsula.  The boycott, as evidencing anti-Austrian\r\nfeeling, was rather a sop to public opinion of Young Turkey, and a\r\nblind to the Powers to hide the perfect accord that existed between\r\nGermany and Turkey at the moment, than the expression of hostility to\r\nAustria-Hungary.  {370} After several months of _pourparlers_ an\r\nagreement was made between Constantinople and Vienna on February 26,\r\n1909.  Turkey agreed to recognize the annexation in return for\r\nfinancial compensation.  The negotiations at Constantinople concerning\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina are a monument to the diplomatic finesse and\r\nskill of the late Baron Marschall von Bieberstein and of Marquis\r\nPallavicini.\r\n\r\nTo lose something that you know you can no longer keep is far different\r\nfrom losing the hope of possession.  It is always more cruel to be\r\ndeprived of an anticipation than of a reality.  Turkey gave up Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina with her usual fatalistic indifference.  Her\r\nsovereignty had been only a fiction after all.  But Servia saw in the\r\naction of Austria-Hungary a fatal blow to her national aspirations.\r\nThe inhabitants of the two Turkish provinces on her west were Servian:\r\nBosnia-Herzegovina formed the centre of the Servian race.  Montenegro\r\non the south was Servian.  Dalmatia on the west was Servian.  Croatia\r\non the north was Servian.  Everything was Servian to the Adriatic Sea.\r\nAnd yet Servia was land-locked.  The Servians determined they would not\r\naccept this annexation.  They appealed to the signatory Powers of\r\nBerlin, and succeeded in arousing a sentiment in Europe favourable to a\r\nEuropean conference.  They threatened to make Austrian and Hungarian\r\nsovereignty intolerable, not only in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also\r\nin Croatia and Dalmatia.\r\n\r\nAustria-Hungary was more than irritated; she was alarmed.  She appealed\r\nto her ally, and pictured {371} the danger to the _Drang nach Osten_.\r\nThe powerful intervention of the German ambassadors in the various\r\nEuropean capitals succeeded in isolating Belgrade.  Russian support of\r\nServia would have meant a European war.  Rather than risk this, France\r\nbegged Russia to yield.  Russia, not yet recovered from the Manchurian\r\ndisaster, ordered Servia to yield.  Austria-Hungary was allowed to\r\nforce Servia into submission.\r\n\r\nFriendless in the face of her too powerful adversary, Servia directed\r\nher Minister at Vienna on March 31, 1909, to make the following formal\r\ndeclaration to the Austro-Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Servia declares that she is not affected in her rights by the\r\nsituation established in Bosnia, and that she will therefore adapt\r\nherself to the decisions at which the Powers are going to arrive in\r\nreference to Art. 25 of the Berlin Treaty.  By following the councils\r\nof the Powers, Servia binds herself to cease the attitude of protest\r\nand resistance which she has assumed since last October, relative to\r\nthe annexation, and she binds herself further to change the direction\r\nof her present policies towards Austria-Hungary, and, in the future, to\r\nlive with the latter in friendly and neighbourly relations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crisis passed.  Servia's humiliation was the price of European\r\npeace.  Germany had shown her determination to stand squarely behind\r\nAustria-Hungary in her dealings with Servia.  It was a lesson for the\r\nfuture.  Five years later history repeated itself--except that Russia\r\ndid not back down!\r\n\r\n{372}\r\n\r\nWe have already told the story of Austria-Hungary's dealings with\r\nServia after the first victorious month of the Balkan War with Turkey:\r\nhow Servia was compelled, owing to lack of support from Russia, to give\r\nsatisfaction to Austria-Hungary in the Prochaska incident, to withdraw\r\nher troops from Durazzo and from before Scutari; and how the Powers\r\nsaved the peace of Europe in May, 1913, by compelling Montenegro to\r\nabandon Scutari.\r\n\r\nEver since the Treaty of Bukarest, Austria-Hungary watched Servia\r\nkeenly for an opportunity to pick a quarrel with her.  It is marvellous\r\nhow the Servians, elated as they naturally were by their military\r\nsuccesses against Turkey and Bulgaria, avoided knocking the chip off\r\nthe shoulder of their jealous and purposely sensitive neighbour.\r\n\r\nIt was one thing to be able to keep a perfectly correct official\r\nattitude towards the Austro-Hungarian Government.  This the Servian\r\nGovernment had promised to do in the note wrung from it on March 31,\r\n1909.  This it _did_ do.  But it was a totally different thing to\r\nexpect the authorities at Belgrade to stifle the national aspirations\r\nof twelve million Servians, the majority of whom were outside of her\r\njurisdiction.  Even if it had been the wiser course for her to\r\npursue--and this is doubtful,--could Servia have been able to repress\r\nthe thoroughly awakened and triumphant nationalism of her own subjects\r\nwho had borne so successfully and so heroically the sufferings and\r\nsacrifices of two wars within one year?\r\n\r\nIndividual Servians, living within the kingdom of {373} Servia, were\r\nirredentists, but without official sanction.  They were undoubtedly in\r\nconnection with the revolutionaries created by Austrian and Hungarian\r\nmethods in the Servian provinces of the Dual Monarchy.  There was\r\nundoubtedly a dream of Greater Servia, and a strong hope in the hearts\r\nof nationalists on both sides of the frontiers that the day would dawn\r\n_by their efforts_ when Greater Servia would be a reality.  No\r\ngovernment could have continued to exist in Servia which tried to\r\nsuppress the _Narodna Obrana_.  I make this statement without\r\nhesitation.  King Peter did not intend to become another Charles Albert.\r\n\r\nOught the Vienna and Berlin statesmen to have expected Servia to do so?\r\nWhat answer would Switzerland or Holland or Belgium or Brazil receive,\r\nwere their ministers to present a note at Wilhelmstrasse or Ballplatz,\r\ncalling attention to the menace to their independence of the\r\nPan-Germanic movement, citing speeches delivered by eminent professors\r\nin universities, books written by officials of the imperial\r\nGovernments, and asking that certain societies be suppressed and\r\ncertain geographies be removed from use in German schools?  Their cause\r\nwould have been as just, and their right as clear, _for exactly the\r\nsame reasons_, as that of the Austrian Government in its attitude\r\ntowards Servia.  The only difference between Pan-Servianism and\r\nPan-Germanism--and you must remember that the latter is not only\r\nencouraged, but also subsidized, by the Berlin and Vienna\r\ngovernments--is that the former is the aspiration of twelve millions\r\nwhile the latter {374} is the aspiration of ninety millions.  Is not\r\nthe answer the old Bismarckian formula that might makes right?\r\n\r\nDuring the winter following the Treaty of Bukarest the Austro-Hungarian\r\nagents and police continued their careful surveillance of the _Narodna\r\nObrana_, and followed all its dealings with Servians of\r\nAustro-Hungarian nationality.  But it could find no _casus belli_.  The\r\nattitude of the Servian Government was perfectly correct at all times.\r\nTraps were laid, but Servian officials did not fall into them.  The\r\noccasion for striking Servia came in a most tragic way.\r\n\r\nIt seems like tempting Providence to have sent the Archduke Franz\r\nFerdinand and his wife to Sarajevo on the anniversary of the battle of\r\nKossova.  Things had been going from bad to worse in Bosnia.  Flags of\r\nthe Dual Monarchy had been burned in Sarajevo and Mostar, and the\r\ngarrisons called upon to intervene to restore order.  The Constitution\r\nof 1910 had been modified in 1912, so that the military Governor was\r\ninvested with civil power.  The local Bosnian Diet had been twice\r\nprorogued.  In May, 1913, the constitution was suspended, and a state\r\nof siege declared in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Throughout the winter of\r\n1913-1914, incipient rebellions had to be checked by force in many\r\nplaces.  It was known to the police that Servian secret societies were\r\nactive, and that the provinces were in a state of danger and\r\ninsecurity.  The Servian Government was apprehensive concerning the\r\nannounced visit of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne.  In fact,\r\nso greatly was it feared that some attempt {375} might be made against\r\nthe life of Franz Ferdinand, and that this would be used as an excuse\r\nfor an attack upon Servia, that the Servian Minister at Vienna, a week\r\nbefore the date announced for the visit, informed the Government that\r\nthere was reason to fear a plot to assassinate the Archduke.\r\n\r\nOn June 28, 1914, the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, the\r\nDuchess of Hohenberg, were assassinated in the streets of Sarajevo.\r\nAustria-Hungary realized that her moment had come.  Germany was\r\nsounded, and found to be ready to prevent outside interference in\r\nwhatever measures Vienna might see fit to take with Belgrade.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1914, the Pasitch Cabinet had almost succumbed in the\r\nstruggle between civil and military elements.  Premier Pasitch retained\r\nhis power by agreeing to a dissolution of Parliament, and binding\r\nhimself to the necessity of following the leadership of the military\r\npart.  So far were the chiefs of the military party from being in a\r\nmood to consider the susceptibilities of Austria-Hungary that they were\r\nactually, according to a telegram from a well-informed source in Agram\r\non June 26, 1914, debating the means of uniting Servia and Montenegro.\r\nThe difficult question of dynasties was in the way of being solved,\r\nand, despite Premier Pasitch's misgivings, the _ballon d'essai_ of the\r\nproject of union had been launched in Europe.  It was at this critical\r\nand delicate moment for the Belgrade Cabinet that the storm broke.\r\n\r\nI was surprised by the spirit of optimism which seemed to pervade the\r\nFrench press during the {376} period immediately following the\r\nassassination of Franz Ferdinand.  For three weeks the telegrams from\r\nVienna repeated over and over again the statement that the ultimatum\r\nwhich Austria-Hungary intended to present at Belgrade as a result of\r\nthe Sarajevo assassination would be so worded that Russia could not\r\ntake offence.  This optimistic opinion, which seems to have been given\r\nalmost official sanction by the Ballplatz, was shared by the French\r\nGovernment.  France is a country in which the inmost thoughts of her\r\nstatesmen are voiced freely in the daily newspapers of Paris.  If there\r\nhad been any serious misgivings, the protocol for the visit of\r\nPresident Poincaré to Petrograd and to the Scandinavian capitals would\r\ncertainly have been modified.\r\n\r\nThe President of France sailed for the Baltic on July 15th.  At six\r\no'clock in the evening of the 23d, the note of the Austro-Hungarian\r\nGovernment concerning the events of the assassination of Sarajevo was\r\ngiven to the Servian Government.  It commenced by reproducing the text\r\nof the Servian declaration of March 31, 1909, which we have quoted\r\nabove.  Servia was accused of not having fulfilled the promise made in\r\nthis declaration, and of permitting the Pan-Servian propaganda in the\r\nnewspapers and public schools of the kingdom.  The assassination of the\r\nArchduke Franz Ferdinand was stated to be the direct result of Servian\r\nfailure to live up to her declaration of March 31, 1909.\r\nAustria-Hungary claimed that the assassination of the heir to her\r\nthrone had been investigated, and that ample proof had been found of\r\nthe connivance of two Servians, {377} one an army officer and the other\r\na functionary who belonged to the _Narodna Obrana_; that the assassins\r\nhad received their arms and their bombs from these two men, and had\r\nbeen knowingly allowed to pass into Bosnia by the Servian authorities\r\non the Serbo-Bosnian frontier.  Being unable to endure longer the\r\nPan-Servian agitation, of which Belgrade was the _foyer_ and the crime\r\nof Sarajevo a direct result, the Austro-Hungarian Government found\r\nitself compelled to demand of the Servian Government the formal\r\nassurance that it condemned this propaganda, which was dangerous to the\r\nexistence of the Dual Monarchy, because its final end was to detach\r\nfrom Austria-Hungary large portions of her territory and attach them to\r\nServia.\r\n\r\nAfter this preamble, the note went on to demand that on the first page\r\nof the _Journal Officiel_ of July 26th the Servian Government publish a\r\nnew declaration, the text of which is so important that we quote it in\r\nfull.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Royal Servian Government condemns the propaganda directed against\r\nAustria-Hungary, _i.e._, the entirety of those machinations whose aim\r\nit is to separate from the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy territories\r\nbelonging thereto, and she regrets sincerely the ghastly consequences\r\nof these criminal actions.\r\n\r\n\"The Royal Servian Government regrets that Servian officers and\r\nofficials have participated in the propaganda cited above, and have\r\nthus threatened the friendly and neighbourly relations which the Royal\r\nGovernment was solemnly bound to cultivate by its declaration of March\r\n31, 1909.\r\n\r\n\"The Royal Government, which disapproves and {378} rejects every\r\nthought or every attempt at influencing the destinies of the\r\ninhabitants of any part of Austria-Hungary, considers it its duty to\r\ncall most emphatically to the attention of its officers and officials,\r\nand of the entire population of the kingdom, that it will hereafter\r\nproceed with the utmost severity against any persons guilty of similar\r\nactions, to prevent and suppress which it will make every effort.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the publication in the_ Journal Officiel_,\r\nAustria-Hungary demanded that the declaration be brought to the\r\nknowledge of the Servian army by an order of the day of King Peter, and\r\nbe published in the official organ of the army.  The Servian Government\r\nwas also asked to make ten promises:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. To suppress any publication which fosters hatred of, and contempt\r\nfor, the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, and whose general tendency is\r\ndirected against the latter's territorial integrity;\r\n\r\n2. To proceed at once with the dissolution of the society _Narodna\r\nObrana_, to confiscate its entire means of propaganda, and to proceed\r\nin the same manner against the other societies and associations in\r\nServia which occupy themselves with the propaganda against\r\nAustria-Hungary, and to take the necessary measures that the dissolved\r\nsocieties may not continue their activities under another name or in\r\nanother form;\r\n\r\n3. To eliminate without delay from the public instruction in Servia, so\r\nfar as the teaching staff as well as the curriculum is concerned,\r\nwhatever serves or may serve to foster the propaganda against\r\nAustria-Hungary;\r\n\r\n4. To remove from military service and public {379} office in general\r\nall officers and officials who are guilty of propaganda against\r\nAustria-Hungary and whose names, with a communication of the evidence\r\nwhich the Imperial and Royal Government possesses against them, the\r\nImperial and Royal Government reserves the right to communicate to the\r\nRoyal Government;\r\n\r\n5. To accept the collaboration in Servia of members of the official\r\nmachinery (_organes_) of the Imperial and Royal Government in the\r\nsuppression of the movement directed against Austro-Hungarian\r\nterritorial integrity;\r\n\r\n6. To commence a judicial investigation (_enquête judiciaire_) against\r\nthe participants of the conspiracy of June 28th, who are on Servian\r\nterritory--members of the official machinery (_organes_) delegated by\r\nthe Austro-Hungarian Government will take part in the researches\r\n(_recherches_) relative thereto;\r\n\r\n7. To proceed immediately to arrest Major Vorja Tankositch and a\r\ncertain Milan Ciganovitch, a functionary of the Servian State, who have\r\nbeen compromised by the result of the preliminary investigation at\r\nSarajevo;\r\n\r\n8. To prevent, by effective measures, the participation of the Servian\r\nauthorities in the smuggling of arms and explosives across the\r\nfrontier, to dismiss and punish severely the functionaries at the\r\nfrontier at Shabatz and at Loznica, guilty of having aided the authors\r\nof the crime of Sarajevo by facilitating their crossing of the frontier;\r\n\r\n9. To give to the Austro-Hungarian Government explanations concerning\r\nthe unjustifiable remarks of high Servian functionaries, in Servia and\r\nabroad, who, in spite of their official position have not hesitated,\r\nafter the crime of June 28th, to express themselves in interviews in a\r\nhostile manner against the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy;\r\n\r\n{380}\r\n\r\n10. To notify without delay to the Austro-Hungarian Government the\r\nexecution of the measures included in the preceding points.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnexed to the note was a memorandum which declared that the\r\ninvestigation of the police, after the assassination of the Archduke\r\nand his wife, had established that the plot had been formed at Belgrade\r\nby the assassins with the help of a commandant in the Servian army,\r\nthat the six bombs and four Browning pistols with their ammunition had\r\nbeen given at Belgrade to the assassins by the Servian functionary and\r\nthe Servian army officer whose names were cited in the note, that the\r\nbombs were hand grenades which came from the Servian army headquarters\r\nat Kragujevac, that the assassins were given instruction in the use of\r\nthe arms by Servian officers, and that the introduction into Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina of the assassins and their arms was facilitated by the\r\nconnivance of three frontier captains and a customs official.\r\n\r\nThe wording of this note seemed to have been entirely unexpected.  The\r\nintention of the ultimatum was clear.  It was understood that Russia\r\nwould not accept an attack upon the integrity of Servia.  Six years had\r\npassed since 1908, and two since 1912.  Russia had recuperated from the\r\nJapanese War, and her Persian accord with Great Britain had borne much\r\nfruit.  She was sure of France.  Was this not a deliberate provocation\r\nto Russia?\r\n\r\nForty-eight hours had been given to Servia to respond.  Russia and\r\nFrance had both counselled {381} Servia to give an answer that would be\r\na _general_ acceptance of the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum.  Neither\r\nFrance nor Russia wanted war.  So anxious were they to avoid giving\r\nAustria-Hungary the opportunity to precipitate the crisis before they\r\nwere ready for it that _for the third time in six years_ Servia was\r\nasked to swallow her pride and submit.  On the night of July 24th, a\r\nmemorable council was held in Belgrade.  The Premier and the leaders of\r\nthe opposition, together with some members of the _Narodna Obrana_ were\r\nshown clearly what course they must follow, if they expected the loyal\r\nsupport of Russia.  The answer to the ultimatum must be worded in such\r\na way that Austria-Hungary would have no ground upon which to stand in\r\nforcing immediately the war.  Servia must once more \"eat humble pie.\"\r\nBut this time the promise of Russian support was given _to defend the\r\nterritorial integrity and the independence of Servia_.\r\n\r\nThe Servian answer was far more conciliatory than was expected.  The\r\nallegations of the Austro-Hungarian preamble were denied, but the\r\npublication of the declaration in the _Journal Officiel_ and in the\r\narmy bulletin, and its incorporation in an order of the day to the\r\narmy, were promised.  But there were to be two changes in the text of\r\nthe declaration.  Instead of \"the Royal Servian Government condemns\r\n_the propaganda against_ Austria-Hungary,\" the Servians agreed to\r\ndeclare that \"the Royal Servian Government condemns _every propaganda\r\nwhich should be directed against_ Austria-Hungary,\" and instead of \"the\r\nRoyal Government regrets _that Servian officers {382} and officials_\r\n... have participated in the propaganda cited above,\" the Servian King\r\ncould say no more than \"the Royal Government regrets _that according to\r\na communication of the Imperial and Royal Government certain officers\r\nand functionaries ... etc._\"\r\n\r\nThe German _White Book_ makes a special point of the bad faith of\r\nServia in altering the text of the declaration in this way.  But what\r\ngovernment could be expected to admit what was only a supposition, and\r\nwhat king worthy of the name would denounce as a regicide openly before\r\nhis army one of his officers upon the unsupported statement of a\r\npolitical document?  The Austro-Hungarian ultimatum had given no proof\r\nof its charges against the man named in its note, and forty-eight hours\r\nwas too short a time for the Servian Government to investigate the\r\ncharges to its own satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIn order to make clear just what was the nature of the demands which\r\nAustria-Hungary made upon Servia, I have cited the ten articles in full.\r\n\r\nOne can readily see that the demands of Articles 1, 2, and 3, in their\r\nentirety, meant the extinction of the Pan-Servian movement and Servian\r\nnationalism.  Austria-Hungary was asking of Servia something that\r\nneither member of the Dual Monarchy had succeeded in accomplishing in\r\nits own territories!  The German _White Book_ attempts to sustain the\r\njustice of the demands of its ally in striking at the press, the\r\nnationalist societies, and the schools.  The methods of arousing a\r\nnationalistic spirit in the Servian people through the press, through\r\nthe formation of societies, {383} and through the teaching of\r\nirredentism by school-books, were borrowed from Germany.  But Servia\r\nagreed to make her press laws more severe, to dissolve the _Narodna\r\nObrana_ and other societies; and \"to eliminate from the public\r\ninstruction in Servia anything which might further the propaganda\r\ndirected against Austria-Hungary, provided the Imperial and Royal\r\nGovernment furnishes actual proofs.\"\r\n\r\nArticle 4 was agreed to only so far as it could be actually proved that\r\nthe officers and officials in question had been \"guilty of actions\r\nagainst the territorial integrity of the monarchy.\"  To promise to\r\nremove all who were \"guilty of propaganda against Austria-Hungary\"\r\nwould have meant the disbanding of the Servian army and the Servian\r\nGovernment!  Is there any man with red blood in his veins who can be\r\nprevented from having hopes and dislikes, and expressing them?  Could\r\nServia prevent Servians from stating how they felt about the political\r\n_status_ of their race in Croatia and in Bosnia?  Did Austria-Hungary\r\never make a similar request to her ally, Italy, about irredentist\r\nliterature and speeches?\r\n\r\nArticles 5 and 6 are open to discussion.  There is no doubt that the\r\nnewspapers of nations hostile to Austria-Hungary and Germany have been\r\nunfair in their interpretation and in their translation of these two\r\narticles.  The Servian answer deliberately gives a false meaning to the\r\nAustrian request here, and represents it as an attack upon the\r\nindependence of her courts.  Servia had enough good grounds for\r\nresistance to the ultimatum without equivocating {384} on this point.\r\nIn her answer she refused what had not been actually demanded, a\r\nco-operation in the _enquête judiciaire_ of Austro-Hungarian _organes_.\r\nWhat Austria-Hungary demanded was the co-operation of her police\r\nofficials in the _recherches_.\r\n\r\nArticles 7 to 10 were accepted by Servia _in toto_.  As a proof of her\r\ngood faith, the Servian answer declared that Major Tankositch had been\r\narrested on the evening of the day on which the ultimatum was received.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Servia offered, if her response to the ultimatum were\r\nfound insufficient, to place her case in the hands of the Hague\r\nTribunal and of the different Powers at whose suggestion she had signed\r\nthe declaration of March 31, 1909, after the excitement over the\r\nAustro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the ultimatum was taken by Premier Pasitch in person to\r\nthe Minister of Austria-Hungary at Belgrade before six o'clock on the\r\nevening of July 25th.  Without referring the response to his\r\nGovernment, the Austro-Hungarian Minister, acting on previous\r\ninstructions that _no answer other than an acceptance in every\r\nparticular of the ultimatum would be admissible_, replied that the\r\nresponse was not satisfactory.  At half-past six, he left Belgrade with\r\nall members of the legation.\r\n\r\nWhile the European chancelleries were trying to find some means to heal\r\nthe breach, Austria-Hungary formally declared war on Servia on the\r\nmorning of July 28th.  The same evening, the bombardment of Belgrade\r\nfrom Semlin and from the Danube {385} was begun.  The Servian\r\nGovernment retired to Nish.\r\n\r\nOnly the intervention of Germany could now prevent the European\r\ncataclysm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{386}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nGERMANY FORCES WAR UPON RUSSIA AND FRANCE\r\n\r\nThe title of this chapter seems to indicate that I have the intention\r\nof taking sides in what many people believe to be an open question.\r\nBut this is not the case.  The German contention, that Russia caused\r\nthe war, must be clearly distinguished from the contention, that Russia\r\nforced the war.  There is a great deal of reason in the first\r\ncontention.  No impartial student, who has written with sympathy\r\nconcerning Great Britain's attitude in the Crimean War, can fail to\r\ngive Germany just as strong justification for declaring war on Russia\r\nin 1914 as Great Britain had in 1854.  But, when we come down to the\r\nnarrower question of responsibility for launching the war in which\r\nalmost all of Europe is now engaged, there can be no doubt that it was\r\ndeliberately willed by the German Government, and that the chain of\r\ncircumstances which brought it about was carefully woven by the\r\nofficials of Wilhelmstrasse and Ballplatz.  There may be honest\r\ndifference of opinion as to whether Germany was justified in forcing\r\nthe war.  But the facts allow no difference of opinion as to whether\r\nGermany _did_ force the war.\r\n\r\n{387}\r\n\r\nA war to crush France and Russia has for many years been accepted as a\r\nnecessary eventuality in the evolution of Germany's foreign policy.\r\nThat when this war came, Great Britain would take the opportunity of\r\njoining in order to strike at German commerce, which had begun to be\r\nlooked upon by British merchants as a formidable rival in the markets\r\nof the world, was thought probable.  The leading men of Germany,\r\nespecially since the passing of Morocco and Persia, have felt that this\r\nwar was vital to the existence of the German Empire.  During recent\r\nyears the questions, \"Ought there to be a war?\" and \"Will there be a\r\nwar?\" ceased to be debated in Germany.  One heard only, \"Under what\r\ncircumstances could _the_ war be most favourably declared?\" and \"How\r\nsoon will _the_ war come?\"\r\n\r\nGermany has believed that the events of the past decade have shown the\r\nunalterable determination of Great Britain and France to make\r\nimpossible the political development of the _Weltpolitik_, without\r\nwhich her commercial development would always be insecure.  This\r\ndetermination has been consistently revealed in the hostility of her\r\nwestern rivals to her colonial expansion in Africa and Asia.  The world\r\nequilibrium, already decidedly disadvantageous to the overseas future\r\nof Germans at the time they began their career as a united people, has\r\nbeen disturbed more and more during the past forty years.\r\n\r\nThe Balkan wars, resulting as they did in the aggrandizement of Servia,\r\nthreatened the equilibrium of the Near East, where lay Germany's most\r\nvital {388} and most promising external activities.  We must remember,\r\nwhen we are considering the reasons for the consistent backing given to\r\nAustria-Hungary by Germany in her treatment of Servian aspirations, the\r\nwords of Wirth: \"_To render powerful the Servian people would be the\r\nsuicide of Germany._\"\r\n\r\nGermany has had as much reason, in the development of the present\r\ncrisis, for regarding Servia as the outpost of Russia as had Great\r\nBritain for awarding this rôle to Bulgaria in 1876.  Germany has had as\r\nmuch reason for declaring war on Russia to prevent the Russians from\r\nsecuring the inheritance of the Ottoman Empire as had Great Britain and\r\nFrance to take exactly the same step in 1854.  The extension, in 1914,\r\nof Russian influence in what was until recently European Turkey would\r\nbe just as disastrous to the interests of Germany and\r\nAustria-Hungary--far more so--than it would have been to Great Britain\r\nand France sixty years ago.  What she has in Asia-Minor to-day is as\r\ngreat a stake for Germany to fight for as what Great Britain had in\r\nIndia in the middle of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, this important difference.  Germany, in supporting\r\nthe Austro-Hungarian ultimatum, was not responding to the overt act of\r\nan enemy.  She calculated carefully the cost, waited for a favourable\r\nmoment, and, when she decided that the favourable moment had come,\r\ndeliberately provoked the war.\r\n\r\nGermany, looking for the opportunity to strike her two powerful\r\nneighbours on the east and west, believed that the propitious moment\r\nhad come in the {389} summer of 1914.  Her rivals were facing serious\r\ninternal crises.  Russia was embarrassed by the menace of a\r\nwidely-spread industrial strike.  But Russia did not count for much in\r\nthe German calculations.  _It was the situation in France that induced\r\nthe German statesmen to take advantage of the assassination of Franz\r\nFerdinand_.  The spring elections had revealed a tremendous sentiment\r\nagainst the law recently voted extending military service for three\r\nyears.  The French Parliament had just overthrown the admirable Ribot\r\nCabinet for no other reason than purely personal considerations of a\r\nbitter party strife.  An eminent Parliamentarian had exposed publicly\r\nfrom the tribune the alarming unpreparedness of France for war.  The\r\ntrial for murder of the wife of the former Premier Caillaux bade fair\r\nto complicate further internal Parliamentary strife.\r\n\r\nThese were the favourable circumstances of the end of June and the\r\nbeginning of July.\r\n\r\nBut the decision had wider grounds than the advantages of the moment.\r\nThe German Government was finding it more and more difficult every year\r\nto secure the credits necessary for the maintenance and increase of her\r\nnaval and military establishments.  Socialism and anti-militarism were\r\nmaking alarming progress in the German _Reichstag_.  On the other hand,\r\nthe Russian military reorganization, commenced after the Japanese War,\r\nwas beginning to show surprising fruits.  And was France to be allowed\r\ntime for the spending of the eight hundred and five million francs just\r\nborrowed by her in June {390} to correct the weak spots in her\r\nfortifications and war material, and for the application of the _loi\r\ndes trois ans_ to increase her standing army?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, would Great Britain be able to intervene on behalf of\r\nFrance and Russia?  The crisis over the Home Rule Bill seemed to have\r\ndeveloped so seriously that civil war was feared.  Sir Edward Carson,\r\nleader of the Protestant irreconcilables in the north of Ireland, had\r\nformed an army that was being drilled in open defiance of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the Duchess of\r\nHohenberg came at this advantageous moment.  A _casus belli_ against\r\nServia, so provokingly lacking, had at last been given.\r\nAustria-Hungary was only too ready for the chance to crush Servia.  If\r\nthere were any misgivings about the risk of doing this, they were\r\nimmediately allayed by Germany, who assured Austria-Hungary that she\r\nwould not allow Russia even to mobilize.  Austria-Hungary was given by\r\nGermany _carte blanche_ in the matter of her dealings with Servia.  It\r\nis possible, as the German Ambassador at Petrograd declared to M.\r\nSasonow, that the text of the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum had not been\r\nsubmitted beforehand for the approval of Wilhelmstrasse.  But the\r\ngeneral tenor of the ultimatum had certainly been agreed upon.  Germany\r\nknew well that the ultimatum would be so worded as to be a challenge to\r\nRussia.  Either Russia would accept once more the humiliation of a\r\ndiplomatic defeat and see Servia crushed, or she would intervene to\r\nsave Servia.  In the latter {391} contingency, Germany could declare\r\nwar upon Russia on the ground that her ally, Austria-Hungary, had been\r\nattacked.  The Franco-Russian Alliance would then be put to the test,\r\nas well as whatever understanding there might be between Great Britain\r\nand France.\r\n\r\nSubsequent events proved that Germany left no means, other than\r\ncomplete submission to her will, to France and Russia for avoiding war.\r\nNegotiations were so carried on that there would be no loop-hole for\r\nescape either to Servia, or to the Great Powers that were her\r\nchampions.  She did not even wait for Russia to attack Austria-Hungary,\r\nor for France to aid Russia.  As for Great Britain, it is not yet clear\r\nwhether Germany really thought that she was making an honest effort to\r\nkeep her out of the war.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of the Servian crisis, Germany associated\r\nherself \"for better or for worse with Austria-Hungary.\"  On the day\r\nthat the ultimatum to Servia was delivered, Chancellor von\r\nBethmann-Hollweg wrote to the German Ambassadors at London, Paris, and\r\nPetrograd, requesting them to call upon the Foreign Ministers of the\r\ngovernments to which they were accredited and point out that the\r\nultimatum was necessary for the \"safety and integrity\" of\r\nAustria-Hungary, and to state with special \"emphasis\" that \"_in this\r\nquestion there is concerned an affair which should be settled\r\nabsolutely between Austria-Hungary and Servia, the limitation to which\r\nit must be the earnest endeavour of the Powers to ensure_.  We\r\nanxiously desire _the localization of the conflict_, {392} because any\r\nintercession by another Power would precipitate, on account of the\r\nvarious alliances, inconceivable consequences.\"\r\n\r\nThe position of Germany is admirably stated in these instructions,\r\nwhich I quote from Exhibit I of the German official _White Book_.  To\r\nthis position, Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg consistently held\r\nthroughout the last week of July.  In the four words \"_localization of\r\nthe conflict_\" the intention of Germany was summed up.  There was to be\r\na conflict between Austria-Hungary and Servia.  That could not be\r\navoided.  The only thing that could be avoided was the intervention of\r\nRussia to prevent the approaching attack of Austria-Hungary upon\r\nServia.  If the Powers friendly to Russia did not prevail upon the Czar\r\nto refrain from interfering, there would be, \"_on account of the\r\nvarious alliances, inconceivable consequences_.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day, July 24th, a telegram from the German Ambassador at\r\nPetrograd to the Chancellor stated that M. Sasonow was very much\r\nagitated, and had \"declared most positively that Russia could not\r\npermit under any circumstances that the Servo-Austrian difficulty be\r\nsettled alone between the parties concerned.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map--Belgium and the Franco-German Frontier]\r\n\r\nThere was still time for Germany, warned by the attitude taken by\r\nRussia, to counsel her ally to accept whatever conciliatory response\r\nServia might give.  But this was not done.  As we have already seen in\r\nthe previous chapter, the Austro-Hungarian Minister at Belgrade,\r\nwithout communicating with his Government, declared the Servian\r\nresponse unsatisfactory, {393} even though it gave an opening for\r\nfurther negotiations, and withdrew from Belgrade with all the members\r\nof the legation staff.\r\n\r\nThis precipitate, and, in view of the gravity of the international\r\nsituation, unreasonable action could have been avoided, had Chancellor\r\nvon Bethmann-Hollweg telegraphed the word to Vienna.\r\n\r\nNot only was the Austro-Hungarian Minister allowed to leave Belgrade in\r\nthis way, but, _after three days had elapsed_, Austria-Hungary took the\r\nirrevocable step of declaring war on Servia.\r\n\r\nDuring these three days, Sir Edward Grey requested the British\r\nAmbassadors at Rome and Vienna and Berlin to make every possible effort\r\nto find ground for negotiation.  On the morning of July 27th, Sir\r\nMaurice de Bunsen, British Ambassador at Vienna, submitted to Count\r\nBerchtold the proposition of Sir Edward Grey, which was made\r\nsimultaneously at Petrograd, that the question at issue be adjusted in\r\na conference held at London.  In the meantime, after a conversation\r\nwith Sir Rennell Rodd, the Marquis di San Giuliano, the Italian\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, telegraphed to Berlin, suggesting that\r\nGermany, France, Great Britain, and Italy mediate between\r\nAustria-Hungary and Russia.  In sharp contrast to the efforts being\r\nmade by the British Ambassadors, the German Ambassador at Paris, in an\r\ninterview with Premier Viviani, insisted upon the impossibility of a\r\nconference of mediation, and announced categorically that _the only\r\npossible solution of the difficulty was a common French and German\r\nintervention at Petrograd_.  In {394} other words, France could avoid\r\nwar by assisting her enemy in humiliating her ally!\r\n\r\nOn July 28th, the German position was: \"That Austria-Hungary must be\r\nleft a free hand in her dealings with Servia, and that it must be\r\npointed out to Russia, if France and Great Britain really wanted to\r\nsave the peace of Europe, that she should not mobilize against\r\nAustria-Hungary.\"  Diplomatic intervention, then, could do nothing\r\nexcept attempt to force Russia to refrain from interfering between\r\nAustria-Hungary and Servia.  Germany would aid the other Powers in\r\ncoercing Russia, but she would not urge herself, or aid them in urging,\r\nupon Austria-Hungary, _who had started the trouble_, the advisability\r\nof modifying her attitude towards Servia, and postponing hostilities\r\nthat were bound to lead to a European war.\r\n\r\nGermany had refused all intervention at Vienna.  She agreed, however,\r\nto prove her good-will by letting it be known that Austria-Hungary was\r\nwilling to make the promise to seek no territorial aggrandizement in\r\nher war with Servia, but to limit herself to a \"punitive expedition.\"\r\n_But this suggestion did not come until Russia had already committed\r\nherself to defend Servia against invasion_.\r\n\r\nThere was another way in which the peace of Europe could have been\r\nsaved, and that was by a declaration on the part of Germany that she\r\nwould allow Russia and Austria-Hungary to fight out the question of\r\nhegemony in south-eastern Europe.  But there was no proposition from\r\nGermany to France suggesting a mutual neutrality.  On the other hand,\r\n{395} Germany let it be known that she would stand by Austria-Hungary\r\nif Russia attacked her, and, in the same breath, warned France against\r\nthe danger of being loyal to the Russian alliance!\r\n\r\nOn July 29th, it was announced from Petrograd that a partial\r\nmobilization had been ordered in the south and south-east.  The German\r\nAmbassador in Petrograd, in an interview with M. Sasonow, pointed out\r\n\"very solemnly that the entire Austro-Servian affair was eclipsed by\r\nthe danger of a general European conflagration, and endeavoured to\r\npresent to the Secretary the magnitude of this danger.  It was\r\nimpossible to dissuade Sasonow from the idea that Servia could now be\r\ndeserted by Russia.\"  On the same day, Ambassador von Schoen at Paris\r\nwas directed by the German Chancellor to \"call the attention of the\r\nFrench Government to the fact that preparation for war in France would\r\ncall forth counter-measures in Germany.\"  An exchange of telegrams on\r\nthe 29th and 30th between the Kaiser and the Czar showed the\r\nirreconcilability between the Russian and German points of view.  The\r\nidea of the Kaiser was that the Czar should give Austria-Hungary a free\r\nhand.  The idea of the Czar was that the attack by Austria-Hungary upon\r\nServia absolutely demanded a Russian mobilization \"directed solely\r\nagainst Austria-Hungary.\"\r\n\r\nOn July 31st, the German Ambassador at Petrograd was ordered to notify\r\nRussia that mobilization against Austria-Hungary must be stopped within\r\ntwelve hours, or Germany would mobilize against Russia.  At the same\r\ntime a telegram was sent to {396} the German Ambassador at Paris,\r\nordering him to \"ask the French Government whether it intends to remain\r\nneutral in a Russo-German war.\"\r\n\r\nOn August 1st, at 7.30 P.M., the German Ambassador at Petrograd handed\r\nthe following declaration of war to Russia:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Imperial Government has tried its best from the beginning of the\r\ncrisis to bring it to a peaceful solution.  Yielding to a desire which\r\nhad been expressed to Him by His Majesty the Emperor of Russia, His\r\nMajesty the Emperor of Germany, in accord with England, was engaged in\r\naccomplishing the rôle of mediator between the Cabinets of Vienna and\r\nof Petrograd, when Russia, without awaiting the result of this\r\nmediation, proceeded to the mobilization of its forces by land and sea.\r\n\r\n\"As a result of this threatening measure, which was actuated by no\r\nmilitary preparation on the part of Germany, the German Empire found\r\nitself facing a grave and imminent danger.  If the Imperial Government\r\nhad failed to ward off this danger, it would compromise the security\r\nand very existence of Germany.  Consequently the German Government saw\r\nitself forced to address itself to the Government of His Majesty, the\r\nEmperor of all the Russias, insisting upon the cessation of the said\r\nmilitary acts.  Russia having refused to accede, and having manifested\r\nby this refusal that this action was directed against Germany, I have\r\nthe honour of making known to Your Excellency the following order from\r\nmy Government:\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty, the Emperor, my august Sovereign, in the name of the\r\nEmpire, accepts the challenge, and considers himself in the state of\r\nwar with Russia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n{397}\r\n\r\nThe same afternoon, President Poincaré ordered a general mobilization\r\nin France.  What Ambassador von Schoen tried to get from Premier\r\nViviani, and what he _did_ get was expressed in his telegram sent from\r\nParis three hours before the call to mobilization was issued:\r\n\r\n\"Upon the repeated definite enquiry whether France would remain neutral\r\nin the case of a Russo-German War, the Premier declared that France\r\nwould do that which her interests dictated.\"\r\n\r\nGermany violated the neutrality of Luxemburg on August 2d, and of\r\nBelgium on August 3d, after vainly endeavouring to secure permission\r\nfrom Belgium for the free passage of her troops to the French frontier.\r\nOn Sunday morning, August 2d, French soil was invaded.  But Ambassador\r\nvon Schoen stayed in Paris until Monday evening \"waiting for\r\ninstructions.\"  Then he called at the Quai d'Orsay, and handed the\r\nfollowing note to Premier Viviani, who was acting also as Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The German civil and military authorities have reported a certain\r\nnumber of definite acts of hostility committed on German territory by\r\nFrench military aviators.  Several of these have clearly violated the\r\nneutrality of Belgium in flying over the territory of this country.\r\nOne of them tried to destroy structures near Wesel; others have been\r\nseen in the region of Eiffel, another has thrown bombs on the railway\r\nnear Karlsruhe and Nürnberg.\r\n\r\n\"I am charged, and I have the honour to make known to Your Excellency\r\nthat, in the presence of these aggressions, the German Empire considers\r\n{398} itself in state of war with France by the act of this latter\r\nPower.\r\n\r\n\"I have at the same time the honour to bring to the knowledge of Your\r\nExcellency that the German authorities will detain the French merchant\r\nships in German ports, but that they will release them if in\r\nforty-eight hours complete reciprocity is assured.\r\n\r\n\"My diplomatic mission having come to an end, there remains to me no\r\nmore than to beg Your Excellency to be willing to give me my passports\r\nand to take what measures you may judge necessary to assure my return\r\nto Germany with the staff of the embassy, as well as with the staff of\r\nthe legation of Bavaria and of the German Consulate-General at Paris.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn communicating this declaration of war to the Chamber of Deputies on\r\nthe following morning, August 4th, Premier Viviani declared formally\r\nthat \"at no moment has a French aviator penetrated into Belgium; no\r\nFrench aviator has committed either in Bavaria or in any part of the\r\nGerman Empire any act of hostility.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{399}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nGREAT BRITAIN ENTERS THE WAR\r\n\r\nThe balance of power in European diplomacy led inevitably to a\r\n_rapprochement_ between France and Russia and Great Britain to offset\r\nthe Triple Alliance of Germany and Austria-Hungary and Italy.\r\n\r\nThe Triple Alliance, however, while purely _defensive_, was still an\r\nalliance.  It had endured or over thirty years, and the three Powers\r\ngenerally sustained each other in diplomatic moves.  Their military and\r\nnaval strategists were in constant communication, and ready at any time\r\nto bring all their forces into play in a European war.\r\n\r\nFrance and Russia had also entered into a defensive alliance.  This had\r\nnot been accomplished without great difficulty.  Were it not for the\r\nconstant menace to France from Germany, the French Parliament would not\r\nhave ratified the alliance in the first place, nor would it have stood\r\nthe strain of increasing Radicalism in French sentiment during the last\r\ndecade.  While there is much intellectual and temperamental affinity\r\nbetween Gaul and Slav, there is no political affinity between\r\ndemocratic France and autocratic Russia.\r\n\r\nThe commercial rivalry of Great Britain and {400} Germany led to a\r\nrivalry of armaments.  The struggle of German industry for the control\r\nof the world markets is the real cause of the creation and rapid\r\ndevelopment of the German navy to threaten the British mastery of the\r\nseas.  It is possible that the statesmen of Great Britain, by a liberal\r\npolicy in regard to German colonial expansion in Africa and Asia and in\r\nregard to German ambitions in Asiatic Turkey, might have diverted\r\nGerman energy from bending all its efforts to destroy British commerce.\r\nIt is possible that such a policy might have enabled the German\r\ndemocracy to gain the power to prevent Prussian militarism from\r\ndominating the Confederation.  But that would have been expecting too\r\nmuch of human nature.  Nations are like individuals.  There never has\r\nbeen any exception to this rule.  What we have we want to keep.  We\r\nwant more than we have, and we try to get it by taking it away from our\r\nneighbour.  Thus the world is in constant struggle.  Until we have the\r\nmillennium, and by the millennium I mean the change of human nature\r\nfrom selfishness to altruism, we shall have war.  Then, too, the\r\nBritish have seen in themselves so striking an illustration of the\r\nproverb that the appetite grows with eating that they could hardly\r\nexpect anything else of the Germans, were they to allow them\r\nvoluntarily \"a place in the sun.\"\r\n\r\nThe rapid growth of Germany along the lines similar to the development\r\nof Great Britain has made the two nations rivals.  As a result of this\r\nrivalry, Great Britain has been forced to prepare for the eventuality\r\nof a conflict between herself and {401} Germany by giving up the policy\r\nof \"splendid isolation,\" and seeking to enter into friendly\r\nrelationship with those European Powers that were the enemies of her\r\nrival.  The first decade of the twentieth century saw British diplomacy\r\ncompounding colonial rivalry with France in Africa and with Russia in\r\nAsia.  The African accord of 1904 and the Asiatic accord of 1907 marked\r\na new era in British foreign relations.  Since their conclusion, Great\r\nBritain has drawn gradually nearer to France and Russia.\r\n\r\nBut British statesmen have had to reckon with the development of\r\nRadical tendencies in the British electorate.  These tendencies have\r\nbecome more and more marked during the very period in which British\r\nforeign policy found that its interests coincided with those of Russia\r\nand France.  British democracy had the same antipathy to a Russian\r\nalliance as had French democracy.  But the menace of Germany, which\r\nthrew France into the arms of Russia, has not seemed as real to the\r\nBritish electorate.  There was also the sentiment against militarism,\r\nwhich has made it difficult for the Liberal Cabinet to secure from\r\nParliament sufficient sums for the maintenance of an adequate naval\r\nestablishment, and has blocked every effort to provide even a modified\r\nform of compulsory military service and military training in Great\r\nBritain and Ireland.\r\n\r\nWhen one considers all that Sir Edward Grey has had to contend with\r\nduring the years that he has held the portfolio of Foreign Affairs in\r\nthe British Cabinet admiration for his achievements knows no limits.\r\nIt is never safe to make comparisons or form judgments {402} in the\r\nappreciation of contemporary figures in history.  But I cannot refrain\r\nfrom stating my belief that British foreign policy has never passed\r\nthrough a more trying and critical period, and British interests have\r\nnever been more ably served, than during the years since the conference\r\nof Algeciras.\r\n\r\nThe menace of a war between Great Britain and Germany has disturbed\r\nEurope several times during the past decade.  There has not been,\r\nhowever, a direct crisis, involving the interests of the two rival\r\nnations, to make an appeal to arms inevitable, or even probable.  But,\r\nalthough British public sentiment might have been slow in supporting\r\nthe intervention of the Cabinet in favour of France, had Germany\r\nattacked France in 1905, in 1908, or in 1911, to have stayed out of the\r\nwar would have been suicidal folly, and Great Britain would soon have\r\nawakened to this fact.\r\n\r\nThe crisis over the ultimatum of Austria-Hungary to Servia became acute\r\nafter the terms of the ultimatum were known.  Sir Edward Grey, seconded\r\nby as skilful and forceful ambassadors as have ever represented British\r\ninterests on the continent of Europe, honestly tried to prevent the\r\noutbreak of war.  It was not to the interests of Great Britain that\r\nthis war should be fought.  All sentimental considerations to one side,\r\nthe moment was peculiarly unfavourable on purely material grounds.  The\r\nBritish Parliament was facing one of the most serious problems of its\r\nhistory.  The confidence of the country in the wisdom of the measures\r\nin Ireland {403} that the Government seemed determined to carry out was\r\nseverely shaken.  The interest of the British public in the troubles\r\nbetween Austria-Hungary and Servia was not great enough to make the war\r\npopular.  The efforts of Lord Haldane had done much to improve the\r\nrelationship between Great Britain and Germany.  Sympathy with Russia\r\nhad been alienated by the increasingly reactionary policy of the Czar's\r\ngovernment towards the Poles, the Finns, and the Jews.  The British\r\npress was disgusted by the overthrow of the Ribot Ministry and by the\r\nrevelations of the Caillaux trial.\r\n\r\nAs there was no actual alliance between Great Britain and France, and\r\nno understanding of any nature whatever with Russia, French public\r\nopinion was far from being certain that British aid would be given in\r\nthe approaching war, _and British public opinion was far from being\r\ncertain as to whether it would be necessary to give this aid, or\r\nwhether it wanted to do so_.  I am speaking here of the feeling among\r\nthe electorate, which, accurately represented by Parliament, is the\r\nfinal court of appeal in Great Britain.  There was no doubt about the\r\nopinion of Sir Edward Grey and the majority of his colleagues in the\r\nCabinet, as well as of the leaders of the Opposition.  There was,\r\nhowever, very serious doubt as to the attitude of Parliament.  Would it\r\nsustain France and Russia over the question of Servia, at a time when\r\nthere was so serious a division in the nation concerning the Home Rule\r\nBill--even the open menace of civil war?\r\n\r\nWhen Germany decided to declare war on Russia, {404} and it was seen\r\nthat France would be drawn into the struggle, Chancellor von\r\nBethmann-Hollweg declared to Sir Edward Goschen, British Ambassador to\r\nGermany, that \"the neutrality of Great Britain once guaranteed, every\r\nassurance would be given to the Cabinet at London that the Imperial\r\nGovernment did not have in view territorial acquisitions at the expense\r\nof France.\"  Sir Edward questioned the Chancellor about the French\r\ncolonies, \"the portions of territories and possessions of France\r\nsituated outside of the continent of Europe.\"  Herr von\r\nBethmann-Hollweg answered that it was not within his power to make any\r\npromise on that subject.\r\n\r\nThere was no hesitation or equivocation in the response of the British\r\nSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs to this proposition.  He said\r\nthat neutrality under such conditions was impossible, and that Great\r\nBritain could not stand by and see France crushed, even if she were\r\nleft her European territory intact, for she would be reduced to the\r\nposition of a satellite of Germany.  To make a bargain with Germany at\r\nthe expense of France would be a disgrace from which Great Britain\r\nwould never recover.  It was pointed out to the Chancellor that the\r\nonly means of maintaining good relations between Great Britain and\r\nGermany would be for the two Powers to continue to work together to\r\nsafeguard the peace of Europe.  Sir Edward Grey promised that all his\r\npersonal efforts would be directed towards guaranteeing Germany and her\r\nAllies against any aggression on the part of Russia and France, and\r\nhoped that, if Germany showed her good faith in the present crisis,\r\n{405} more friendly relations between Great Britain and Germany would\r\nensue than had been the case up to that moment.\r\n\r\nThis dignified and manly response could have left no doubt in the minds\r\nof German statesmen as to the stand which the British Cabinet intended\r\nto take.  Did they believe that Parliament and the people would not\r\nsupport Sir Edward Grey?\r\n\r\nThe position of Great Britain was explicitly put before the House of\r\nCommons on the evening of August 3d.  Because of her naval agreement\r\nwith France, by which the French navy was concentrated in the\r\nMediterranean in order that the British Admiralty might keep its full\r\nforces in home waters, Great Britain was bound in honour to prevent an\r\nattack of a hostile fleet upon the Atlantic seacoast of France.  If\r\nGermany were to make such an attack, Great Britain would be drawn into\r\nthe war without any further question.  There had also been since\r\nNovember, 1912, an understanding between the British and French\r\nmilitary and naval authorities concerning common action on land and sea\r\n\"against an enemy.\"  But, at the time this understanding was made, it\r\nwas put in writing that it was merely a measure of prudence, and did\r\nnot bind Great Britain in any way whatever to act with France either in\r\na defensive or offensive war.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain was drawn into the war by the German violation of the\r\nneutrality of Belgium.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday evening, August 2d, at seven o'clock, Germany gave the\r\nfollowing ultimatum to Belgium:\r\n\r\n\"The German Government has received sure news, {406} according to which\r\nthe French forces have the intention of marching on the Meuse by way of\r\nGivet and Namur; this news leaves no doubt of the intention of France\r\nto march against Germany by way of Belgian territory.  The Imperial\r\nGerman Government cannot help fearing that Belgium, in spite of its\r\nvery good will, will not be able to repulse, without help, a forward\r\nmarch of French troops which promises so large a development.\r\n\r\n\"In this fact we find sufficient certitude of a threat directed against\r\nGermany; it is an imperious duty for self-preservation for Germany to\r\nforestall this attack of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"The German Government would regret exceedingly should Belgium regard\r\nas an act of hostility against it the fact that the enemies of Germany\r\noblige her to violate, on her side, the territory of Belgium.  In order\r\nto dissipate every misunderstanding, the German Government declares as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"1. Germany has in view no act of hostility against Belgium, if Belgium\r\nconsents, in the war which is going to commence, to adopt an attitude\r\nof benevolent neutrality in regard to Germany.  The German Government,\r\non its side, promises, at the moment of peace, to guarantee the kingdom\r\nand its possessions in their entire extent.  2. Germany promises to\r\nevacuate Belgian territory, under the condition above pronounced,\r\nimmediately peace is concluded.  3. If Belgium observes a friendly\r\nattitude, Germany is ready, in accord with the authorities of the\r\nBelgian Government, to buy, paying cash, all that would be necessary\r\nfor her troops, and to indemnify the losses caused to Belgium.  4. If\r\nBelgium conducts herself in a hostile manner against the German troops\r\nand makes in particular difficulties for their forward march by an\r\nopposition of the fortifications of the Meuse or by the destruction of\r\n{407} roads, railways, tunnels, or other constructions, Germany will be\r\nobliged to consider Belgium as an enemy.\r\n\r\n\"In this case, Germany will make no promise in regard to the kingdom,\r\nbut will leave the subsequent adjustment of the relations of the two\r\nstates one toward the other to the decision of arms.\r\n\r\n\"The German Government has the hope with reason that this eventuality\r\nwill not take place, and that the Belgian Government will know how to\r\ntake the necessary measures suitable for preventing it from taking\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\"In this case, the relations of friendship which unite the two\r\nneighbouring states will become narrower and more lasting.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBelgium did not hesitate to respond promptly as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"By its note of August 2, 1914, the German Government has made known\r\nthat according to sure news the French forces have the intention of\r\nmarching on the Meuse by way of Givet and Namur, and that Belgium, in\r\nspite of her very good will, would not be able to repulse without help\r\nthe forward march of the French troops.\r\n\r\n\"The German Government would believe itself under the obligation of\r\nforestalling this attack and of violating the Belgian territory.  In\r\nthese conditions, Germany proposes to the Government of the King to\r\nadopt in regard to her a friendly attitude, and she promises at the\r\nmoment of the peace to guarantee the integrity of the kingdom and of\r\nits possessions in their entire extent.\r\n\r\n\"The note adds that if Belgium makes difficulty for the forward march\r\nof the German troops, Germany will be obliged to consider her as an\r\nenemy but will leave the subsequent adjustment of the {408} relations\r\nof the two states one towards the other by the decision of arms.\r\n\r\n\"This note has aroused in the Government of the King a deep and\r\ngrievous astonishment.  The intentions that it attributes to France are\r\nin contradiction with the formal declarations which have been made to\r\nus on August 1st, in the name of the Government of the Republic.\r\n\r\n\"However, if in opposition to our expectation a violation of the\r\nBelgian neutrality is going to be committed by France, Belgium would\r\nfulfil all her international duties, and her army would oppose itself\r\nto the invader with the most vigorous resistance.  The treaties of\r\n1839, confirmed by the treaties of 1870, make sacred the independence\r\nand the neutrality of Belgium under the guarantee of the Powers and\r\nnotably of the Government of His Majesty the King of Prussia.\r\n\r\n\"Belgium has always been faithful to her international obligations; she\r\nhas accomplished her duties in a spirit of loyal impartiality, she has\r\nneglected no effort to maintain and to make respected her neutrality.\r\nThe attack upon her independence with which the German Government\r\nmenaces her would constitute a flagrant violation of international law.\r\n\r\n\"No strategic interest justifies the violation of international law.\r\nThe Belgian Government in accepting the propositions of which it has\r\nreceived notice would sacrifice the honour of the nation at the same\r\ntime as it would betray its duties toward Europe.  Conscious of the\r\nrôle that Belgium has played for more than eighty years in the\r\ncivilization of the world, it does not allow itself to believe that the\r\nindependence of Belgium can be preserved only at the price of the\r\nviolation of her neutrality.  If this hope is deceived, the Belgian\r\nGovernment is firmly decided to repulse by every means in its power\r\nevery attack upon its rights.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map--Europe in 1914]\r\n\r\n{409}\r\n\r\nAs I record these two statements, there is before me a cartoon from a\r\nrecent issue of _Punch_.  The Kaiser, with a leer on his face, is\r\nleaning over the shoulder of King Albert, who is looking out with\r\nfolded arms upon the smoking ruins of his country, and the long defile\r\nof refugees.  The Kaiser says, \"See, you have lost all.\"  King Albert\r\nanswers, \"Not my soul.\"\r\n\r\nTo be just to Germany, is necessary for us to quote the explanation of\r\nthis action made by Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg to the _Reichstag_,\r\non August 4th, when Germany had commenced to carry into execution her\r\nthreat:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Here is the truth.  We are in necessity, and necessity knows no law.\r\n\r\n\"Our troops have occupied Luxemburg, and have perhaps already put their\r\nfoot upon Belgium territory.\r\n\r\n\"It is against the law of nations.  The French Government has, it is\r\ntrue, declared at Brussels that it would respect the neutrality of\r\nBelgium, so long as the enemy respected it.  We knew, however, that\r\nFrance was ready for the aggression.  France could wait; we, no.  A\r\nFrench attack upon our flank in the Lower Rhine might have been fatal\r\nto us.  So we have been forced to pass beyond the well-founded\r\nprotestations of Luxemburg and the Belgian Government.  We shall\r\nrecompense them for the wrong that we have thus caused them as soon as\r\nwe shall have attained our military end.\r\n\r\n\"When one is as threatened as we are and when one fights for that which\r\nis most sacred to him, one can think only of one thing, that is, to\r\nattain his end, cost what it may.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n{410}\r\n\r\n\"I repeat the words of the Emperor; 'It is with pure conscience that\r\nGermany goes to the combat.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of August 3d, as Sir Edward Grey was leaving for\r\nParliament to make his _exposé_ of Great Britain's position in the\r\nEuropean crisis, he received from the King a telegram that had just\r\narrived from King Albert of Belgium:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Remembering the numerous proofs of friendship of Your Majesty and of\r\nYour predecessor, and the friendly attitude of Great Britain in 1870,\r\nas well as of the new gage of friendship that she has just given me, I\r\naddress a supreme appeal to the diplomatic intervention of Your Majesty\r\nto safeguard the integrity of Belgium.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Edward Grey read this telegram to Parliament, and explained that\r\nthe diplomatic intervention asked for had already been made both at\r\nParis and Berlin, for this eventuality had been foreseen.  To the\r\nquestions of the British Ambassadors concerning their intentions\r\ntowards Belgium, _to respect and maintain the neutrality of which each\r\nof these Powers was equally bound with Great Britain by the treaty of\r\n1839_, France responded by telegraph received August 1st:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"French Government are resolved to respect the neutrality of Belgium,\r\nand it would only be in the event of some other Power violating that\r\nneutrality that France might find herself under the necessity, in order\r\nto assure defense of her own security, to act otherwise.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGermany answered the same day through Sir E. Goschen;\r\n\r\n{411}\r\n\r\n\"I have seen the Secretary of State, who informs me that he must\r\nconsult the Emperor and the Chancellor before he could possibly answer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Edward Goschen expressed the hope that the answer would not be\r\ndelayed, Herr von Jagow gave him clearly to understand that he doubted\r\nwhether he could respond, \"for any response on his part would not fail,\r\nin case of war, to have the regrettable effect of divulging a part of\r\nthe German plan of campaign!\"\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about the sentiment of Parliament.  The Cabinet saw\r\nthat party lines had been obliterated, and that the country was behind\r\nthem.  The following day, August 4th, Great Britain presented an\r\nultimatum to Germany, demanding an assurance that the neutrality of\r\nBelgium should be respected.  Germany gave no answer.  Her army had\r\nalready invaded Belgium.  A few hours after the reception of the\r\nBritish ultimatum, the advance on Liège was ordered.  After waiting\r\nuntil evening, Great Britain declared war on Germany.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Germany counted the cost before she invaded\r\nBelgium.  Whatever may have been said at Berlin, the intervention of\r\nGreat Britain was not the surprise that it has been represented to be.\r\nIn deciding to violate Belgian neutrality, in spite of the British\r\nultimatum, the German argument was: It is morally certain that Great\r\nBritain will intervene if we enter Belgium.  But what will this\r\nintervention mean?  She has no army worth the name.  Her navy can do\r\npractically nothing to harm {412} us while we are crushing France and\r\nRussia.  The participation of Great Britain in the war is a certainty a\r\nfew weeks later.  By precipitating her intervention, we are less harmed\r\nthan we would be by refusing to avail ourselves of the advantage of\r\nattacking France through Belgium.\r\n\r\nIn believing that the eventual participation of Great Britain was\r\ncertain, even if there were no Belgian question, Germany was right.\r\nThe violation of the neutrality of Belgium was not the cause, but the\r\noccasion, of Great Britain's entry into the war.  It was, however, a\r\nmost fortunate opportunity for the British Cabinet to secure popular\r\nsympathy and support in declaring war upon Germany.  For it is certain\r\nthat Great Britain ought not to have delayed entering the war.  The\r\nnation might have awakened too late to the fact that the triumph of\r\nGermany in Europe would menace her national existence.  There is no\r\nroom in the world for the amicable dwelling side by side of Anglo-Saxon\r\nidealism and German militarism.  One or the other must perish.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1914, the only way to have avoided the catastrophe of a\r\ngeneral European war would have been to allow Germany to make,\r\naccording to her own desires and ambitions, the new map of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{413}\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAbdul-Hamid deposed as Sultan, 185\r\n\r\nAdana massacres, 190\r\n\r\nAdrianople, invested by Bulgarians in Balkan War, 292;
