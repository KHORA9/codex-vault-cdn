RICHARDSON\r\n\r\nA REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE STATE OF TENNESSEE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED BY AUTHORITY OF CONGRESS\r\n\r\n1902\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWilliam McKinley\r\n\r\nMessages, Proclamations, and Executive Orders Relating to the\r\nSpanish-American War\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam McKinley\r\n\r\nWilliam McKinley, the twenty-fifth President of the United States, was\r\nborn in Niles, Trumbull County, Ohio, January 29, 1843. His ancestors on\r\nthe paternal side, who were Scotch-Irish, came from Scotland and located\r\nin Pennsylvania. His great-grandfather, David McKinley, after serving in\r\nthe Revolution, resided in Pennsylvania until 1814, when he went to\r\nOhio, where he died in 1840, at the age of 85. The grandmother of the\r\nPresident, Mary Rose, came from a Puritan family that fled from England\r\nto Holland and emigrated to Pennsylvania with William Penn. The father\r\nof the President, William McKinley, sr., was born in Pine Township,\r\nMercer County, Pa., in 1807, and married Nancy Campbell Allison, of\r\nColumbiana County, Ohio, in 1829. Both the grandfather and father of the\r\nPresident were iron manufacturers. His father was a devout Methodist,\r\na stanch Whig and Republican, and an ardent advocate of a protective\r\ntariff. He died during his son's first term as governor of Ohio, in\r\nNovember, 1892, at the age of 85. The mother of the President passed\r\naway at Canton, Ohio, in December, 1897, at the advanced age of 89.\r\nWilliam McKinley was educated in the public schools of Niles, Union\r\nSeminary, at Poland, Ohio, and Allegheny College, at Meadville, Pa.\r\nBefore attaining his majority taught in the public schools. At the\r\nage of 16 became a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church. At the\r\nbeginning of hostilities in the War between the States Mr. McKinley,\r\nwho was a clerk in the Poland post-office, volunteered his services,\r\nand on June 11, 1861, was enlisted as a private in the Twenty-third Ohio\r\nVolunteer Infantry. Participated in all the early engagements in West\r\nVirginia, and in the winter's camp at Fayetteville received his first\r\npromotion, commissary-sergeant, on April 15, 1862. In recognition of his\r\nservices at Antietam, Sergeant McKinley was made second lieutenant, his\r\ncommission dating from September 24, 1862, and on February 7, 1863,\r\nwhile at Camp Piatt, he was again promoted, receiving the rank of first\r\nlieutenant. In the retreat near Lynchburg, Va., his regiment marched 180\r\nmiles, fighting nearly all the time, with scarcely any rest or food.\r\nLieutenant McKinley conducted himself with gallantry, and at Winchester\r\nwon additional honors. The Thirteenth West Virginia Regiment failed to\r\nretire when the rest of Hayes's brigade fell back, and, being in great\r\ndanger of capture, the young lieutenant was directed to go and bring\r\nit away, which he did in safety, after riding through a heavy fire.\r\nOn July 25, 1864, at the age of 21, McKinley was promoted to the rank of\r\ncaptain. The brigade continued its fighting up and down the Shenandoah\r\nValley. At Berryville, Va., September 3, 1864, Captain McKinley's horse\r\nwas shot from under him. Served successively on the staffs of Generals\r\nR.B. Hayes, George Crook, and Winfield S. Hancock, and on March 14,\r\n1865, was brevetted major of United States Volunteers by President\r\nLincoln for gallantry in the battles of Opequan, Cedar Creek, and\r\nFishers Hill. Was detailed as acting assistant adjutant-general of the\r\nFirst Division, First Army Corps, on the staff of General Samuel S.\r\nCarroll. At the close of the war was urged to remain in the Army, but,\r\ndeferring to the judgment of his father, was mustered out of the service\r\nJuly 26, 1865, and returned to Poland. At once began the study of law\r\nunder Glidden & Wilson, of Youngstown, Ohio, and later attended the\r\nlaw school in Albany, N.Y. Was admitted to the bar in March, 1867, at\r\nWarren, Ohio, and the same year removed to Canton, Ohio, which has since\r\nbeen his home. In 1867 his first political speeches were made in favor\r\nof negro suffrage. In 1869 was elected prosecuting attorney of Stark\r\nCounty, and served one term, being defeated two years later for the same\r\noffice. Mr. McKinley took an active interest in State politics, and made\r\nspeeches in many of the campaigns. On January 25, 1871, married Miss\r\nIda Saxton. Two daughters were born to them, both of whom died in\r\nearly childhood. In 1876 was elected a member of the National House of\r\nRepresentatives, and for fourteen years represented the Congressional\r\ndistrict of which his county was a part, except for a portion of his\r\nfourth term, when he was unseated late in the first session. While in\r\nCongress served on the Committees on the Judiciary, Revision of the\r\nLaws, Expenditures in the Post-Office Department, Rules, and Ways and\r\nMeans. As chairman of the last-named committee in the Fifty-first\r\nCongress, reported the tariff law of 1890. At the beginning of this\r\nCongress was defeated in the caucus of his party for the Speakership of\r\nthe House. In the meantime, his district having been materially changed,\r\nhe was defeated for reelection to Congress in November, 1890, though he\r\nlargely reduced the usual majority against his party in the counties of\r\nwhich the new district was constituted. In 1891 was elected governor of\r\nOhio by a plurality of 21,500, and in 1893 was reelected by a plurality\r\nof 80,995. In 1884 was a delegate at large to the Republican national\r\nconvention, and supported James G. Blaine for President; was a member\r\nof the committee on resolutions, and presented the platform to the\r\nconvention. Also attended the convention of his party in 1888 as a\r\ndelegate at large from Ohio, supporting John Sherman for President,\r\nand as chairman of the committee on resolutions again reported the\r\nplatform. In 1892 was again a delegate at large from Ohio, and\r\nsupported the renomination of Benjamin Harrison, and served as chairman\r\nof the convention. At that convention 182 votes were cast for him\r\nfor President, although he had persistently refused to have his name\r\nconsidered. On June 18, 1896, was nominated for President by the\r\nnational convention of his party at St. Louis, receiving on the first\r\nballot 661-1/2 out of a total of 922 votes. Was chosen President at the\r\nensuing November election by a plurality in the popular vote of over\r\n600,000, and received 271 electoral votes, against 176 for William J.\r\nBryan, of Nebraska.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 17, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:_\r\n\r\nOfficial information from our consuls in Cuba establishes the fact that\r\na large number of American citizens in the island are in a state of\r\ndestitution, suffering for want of food and medicines. This applies\r\nparticularly to the rural districts of the central and eastern parts.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural classes have been forced from their farms into\r\nthe nearest towns, where they are without work or money. The local\r\nauthorities of the several towns, however kindly disposed, are unable to\r\nrelieve the needs of their own people and are altogether powerless to\r\nhelp our citizens.\r\n\r\nThe latest report of Consul-General Lee estimates six to eight hundred\r\nAmericans are without means of support. I have assured him that\r\nprovision would be made at once to relieve them. To that end I recommend\r\nthat Congress make an appropriation of not less than $50,000, to be\r\nimmediately available, for use under the direction of the Secretary of\r\nState.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that a part of the sum which may be appropriated by\r\nCongress should, in the discretion of the Secretary of State, also be\r\nused for the transportation of American citizens who, desiring to return\r\nto the United States, are without means to do so.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 6, 1897_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most important problem with which this Government is now called upon\r\nto deal pertaining to its foreign relations concerns its duty toward\r\nSpain and the Cuban insurrection. Problems and conditions more or less\r\nin common with those now existing have confronted this Government at\r\nvarious times in the past. The story of Cuba for many years has been one\r\nof unrest, growing discontent, an effort toward a larger enjoyment of\r\nliberty and self-control, of organized resistance to the mother country,\r\nof depression after distress and warfare, and of ineffectual settlement\r\nto be followed by renewed revolt. For no enduring period since the\r\nenfranchisement of the continental possessions of Spain in the Western\r\nContinent has the condition of Cuba or the policy of Spain toward Cuba\r\nnot caused concern to the United States.\r\n\r\nThe prospect from time to time that the weakness of Spain's hold upon\r\nthe island and the political vicissitudes and embarrassments of the home\r\nGovernment might lead to the transfer of Cuba to a continental power\r\ncalled forth between 1823 and 1860 various emphatic declarations of\r\nthe policy of the United States to permit no disturbance of Cuba's\r\nconnection with Spain unless in the direction of independence or\r\nacquisition by us through purchase, nor has there been any change of\r\nthis declared policy since upon the part of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe revolution which began in 1868 lasted for ten years despite the\r\nstrenuous efforts of the successive peninsular governments to suppress\r\nit. Then as now the Government of the United States testified its grave\r\nconcern and offered its aid to put an end to bloodshed in Cuba. The\r\novertures made by General Grant were refused and the war dragged on,\r\nentailing great loss of life and treasure and increased injury to\r\nAmerican interests, besides throwing enhanced burdens of neutrality upon\r\nthis Government. In 1878 peace was brought about by the truce of Zanjon,\r\nobtained by negotiations between the Spanish commander, Martinez de\r\nCampos, and the insurgent leaders.\r\n\r\nThe present insurrection broke out in February, 1895. It is not\r\nmy purpose at this time to recall its remarkable increase or to\r\ncharacterize its tenacious resistance against the enormous forces massed\r\nagainst it by Spain. The revolt and the efforts to subdue it carried\r\ndestruction to every quarter of the island, developing wide proportions\r\nand defying the efforts of Spain for its suppression. The civilized code\r\nof war has been disregarded, no less so by the Spaniards than by the\r\nCubans.\r\n\r\nThe existing conditions can not but fill this Government and the\r\nAmerican people with the gravest apprehension. There is no desire on the\r\npart of our people to profit by the misfortunes of Spain. We have only\r\nthe desire to see the Cubans prosperous and contented, enjoying that\r\nmeasure of self-control which is the inalienable right of man, protected\r\nin their right to reap the benefit of the exhaustless treasures of their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe offer made by my predecessor in April, 1896, tendering the friendly\r\noffices of this Government, failed. Any mediation on our part was not\r\naccepted. In brief, the answer read: \"There is no effectual way to\r\npacify Cuba unless it begins with the actual submission of the rebels\r\nto the mother country.\" Then only could Spain act in the promised\r\ndirection, of her own motion and after her own plans.\r\n\r\nThe cruel policy of concentration was initiated February 16, 1896. The\r\nproductive districts controlled by the Spanish armies were depopulated.\r\nThe agricultural inhabitants were herded in and about the garrison\r\ntowns, their lands laid waste and their dwellings destroyed. This policy\r\nthe late cabinet of Spain justified as a necessary measure of war and as\r\na means of cutting off supplies from the insurgents. It has utterly\r\nfailed as a war measure. It was not civilized warfare. It was\r\nextermination.\r\n\r\nAgainst this abuse of the rights of war I have felt constrained on\r\nrepeated occasions to enter the firm and earnest protest of this\r\nGovernment. There was much of public condemnation of the treatment of\r\nAmerican citizens by alleged illegal arrests and long imprisonment\r\nawaiting trial or pending protracted judicial proceedings. I felt it my\r\nfirst duty to make instant demand for the release or speedy trial of all\r\nAmerican citizens under arrest. Before the change of the Spanish cabinet\r\nin October last twenty-two prisoners, citizens of the United States, had\r\nbeen given their freedom.\r\n\r\nFor the relief of our own citizens suffering because of the conflict\r\nthe aid of Congress was sought in a special message,[1] and under\r\nthe appropriation of May 24, 1897,[2] effective aid has been given to\r\nAmerican citizens in Cuba, many of them at their own request having been\r\nreturned to the United States.\r\n\r\nThe instructions given to our new minister to Spain before his departure\r\nfor his post directed him to impress upon that Government the sincere\r\nwish of the United States to lend its aid toward the ending of the war\r\nin Cuba by reaching a peaceful and lasting result, just and honorable\r\nalike to Spain and to the Cuban people. These instructions recited the\r\ncharacter and duration of the contest, the widespread losses it entails,\r\nthe burdens and restraints it imposes upon us, with constant disturbance\r\nof national interests, and the injury resulting from an indefinite\r\ncontinuance of this state of things. It was stated that at this juncture\r\nour Government was constrained to seriously inquire if the time was not\r\nripe when Spain of her own volition, moved by her own interests and\r\nevery sentiment of humanity, should put a stop to this destructive war\r\nand make proposals of settlement honorable to herself and just to her\r\nCuban colony. It was urged that as a neighboring nation, with large\r\ninterests in Cuba, we could be required to wait only a reasonable time\r\nfor the mother country to establish its authority and restore peace and\r\norder within the borders of the island; that we could not contemplate an\r\nindefinite period for the accomplishment of this result.\r\n\r\nNo solution was proposed to which the slightest idea of humiliation to\r\nSpain could attach, and, indeed, precise proposals were withheld to\r\navoid embarrassment to that Government. All that was asked or expected\r\nwas that some safe way might be speedily provided and permanent peace\r\nrestored. It so chanced that the consideration of this offer, addressed\r\nto the same Spanish administration which had declined the tenders of\r\nmy predecessor, and which for more than two years had poured men and\r\ntreasure into Cuba in the fruitless effort to suppress the revolt, fell\r\nto others. Between the departure of General Woodford, the new envoy,\r\nand his arrival in Spain the statesman who had shaped the policy of his\r\ncountry fell by the hand of an assassin, and although the cabinet of the\r\nlate premier still held office and received from our envoy the proposals\r\nhe bore, that cabinet gave place within a few days thereafter to a new\r\nadministration, under the leadership of Sagasta.\r\n\r\nThe reply to our note was received on the 23d day of October. It is in\r\nthe direction of a better understanding. It appreciates the friendly\r\npurposes of this Government. It admits that our country is deeply\r\naffected by the war in Cuba and that its desires for peace are just.\r\nIt declares that the present Spanish government is bound by every\r\nconsideration to a change of policy that should satisfy the United\r\nStates and pacify Cuba within a reasonable time. To this end Spain has\r\ndecided to put into effect the political reforms heretofore advocated by\r\nthe present premier, without halting for any consideration in the path\r\nwhich in its judgment leads to peace. The military operations, it is\r\nsaid, will continue, but will be humane and conducted with all regard\r\nfor private rights, being accompanied by political action leading to\r\nthe autonomy of Cuba while guarding Spanish sovereignty. This, it is\r\nclaimed, will result in investing Cuba with a distinct personality, the\r\nisland to be governed by an executive and by a local council or chamber,\r\nreserving to Spain the control of the foreign relations, the army and\r\nnavy, and the judicial administration. To accomplish this the present\r\ngovernment proposes to modify existing legislation by decree, leaving\r\nthe Spanish Cortes, with the aid of Cuban senators and deputies, to\r\nsolve the economic problem and properly distribute the existing debt.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of a declaration of the measures that this Government\r\nproposes to take in carrying out its proffer of good offices, it\r\nsuggests that Spain be left free to conduct military operations and\r\ngrant political reforms, while the United States for its part shall\r\nenforce its neutral obligations and cut off the assistance which it is\r\nasserted the insurgents receive from this country. The supposition of an\r\nindefinite prolongation of the war is denied. It is asserted that the\r\nwestern provinces are already well-nigh reclaimed, that the planting of\r\ncane and tobacco therein has been resumed, and that by force of arms and\r\nnew and ample reforms very early and complete pacification is hoped for.\r\n\r\nThe immediate amelioration of existing conditions under the new\r\nadministration of Cuban affairs is predicted, and therewithal the\r\ndisturbance and all occasion for any change of attitude on the part\r\nof the United States. Discussion of the question of the international\r\nduties and responsibilities of the United States as Spain understands\r\nthem is presented, with an apparent disposition to charge us with\r\nfailure in this regard. This charge is without any basis in fact. It\r\ncould not have been made if Spain had been cognizant of the constant\r\nefforts this Government has made, at the cost of millions and by the\r\nemployment of the administrative machinery of the nation at command,\r\nto perform its full duty according to the law of nations. That it has\r\nsuccessfully prevented the departure of a single military expedition or\r\narmed vessel from our shores in violation of our laws would seem to be\r\na sufficient answer. But of this aspect of the Spanish note it is not\r\nnecessary to speak further now. Firm in the conviction of a wholly\r\nperformed obligation, due response to this charge has been made in\r\ndiplomatic course.\r\n\r\nThroughout all these horrors and dangers to our own peace this\r\nGovernment has never in any way abrogated its sovereign prerogative of\r\nreserving to itself the determination of its policy and course according\r\nto its own high sense of right and in consonance with the dearest\r\ninterests and convictions of our own people should the prolongation of\r\nthe strife so demand.\r\n\r\nOf the untried measures there remain only: Recognition of the insurgents\r\nas belligerents; recognition of the independence of Cuba; neutral\r\nintervention to end the war by imposing a rational compromise between\r\nthe contestants, and intervention in favor of one or the other party.\r\nI speak not of forcible annexation, for that can not be thought of.\r\nThat, by our code of morality, would be criminal aggression.\r\n\r\nRecognition of the belligerency of the Cuban insurgents has often\r\nbeen canvassed as a possible, if not inevitable, step both in regard\r\nto the previous ten years struggle and during the present war. I am\r\nnot unmindful that the two Houses of Congress in the spring of 1896\r\nexpressed the opinion by concurrent resolution that a condition of\r\npublic war existed requiring or justifying the recognition of a state\r\nof belligerency in Cuba, and during the extra session the Senate voted\r\na joint resolution of like import, which, however, was not brought\r\nto a vote in the House of Representatives. In the presence of these\r\nsignificant expressions of the sentiment of the legislative branch it\r\nbehooves the Executive to soberly consider the conditions under which\r\nso important a measure must needs rest for justification. It is to be\r\nseriously considered whether the Cuban insurrection possesses beyond\r\ndispute the attributes of statehood, which alone can demand the\r\nrecognition of belligerency in its favor. Possession, in short, of\r\nthe essential qualifications of sovereignty by the insurgents and the\r\nconduct of the war by them according to the received code of war are\r\nno less important factors toward the determination of the problem of\r\nbelligerency than are the influences and consequences of the struggle\r\nupon the internal polity of the recognizing state.\r\n\r\nThe wise utterances of President Grant in his memorable message of\r\nDecember 7, 1875, are signally relevant to the present situation in\r\nCuba, and it may be wholesome now to recall them. At that time a ruinous\r\nconflict had for seven years wasted the neighboring island. During all\r\nthose years an utter disregard of the laws of civilized warfare and\r\nof the just demands of humanity, which called forth expressions of\r\ncondemnation from the nations of Christendom, continued unabated.\r\nDesolation and ruin pervaded that productive region, enormously\r\naffecting the commerce of all commercial nations, but that of the United\r\nStates more than any other by reason of proximity and larger trade and\r\nintercourse. At that juncture General Grant uttered these words, which\r\nnow, as then, sum up the elements of the problem:\r\n\r\n  A recognition of the independence of Cuba being, in my opinion,\r\n  impracticable and indefensible, the question which next presents itself\r\n  is that of the recognition of belligerent rights in the parties to the\r\n  contest.\r\n\r\n  In a former message to Congress[3] I had occasion to consider this\r\n  question, and reached the conclusion that the conflict in Cuba,\r\n  dreadful and devastating as were its incidents, did not rise to the\r\n  fearful dignity of war. * * * It is possible that the acts of foreign\r\n  powers, and even acts of Spain herself, of this very nature, might be\r\n  pointed to in defense of such recognition. But now, as in its past\r\n  history, the United States should carefully avoid the false lights\r\n  which might lead it into the mazes of doubtful law and of questionable\r\n  propriety, and adhere rigidly and sternly to the rule, which has been\r\n  its guide, of doing only that which is right and honest and of good\r\n  report. The question of according or of withholding rights of\r\n  belligerency must be judged in every case in view of the particular\r\n  attending facts. Unless justified by necessity, it is always, and\r\n  justly, regarded as an unfriendly act and a gratuitous demonstration\r\n  of moral support to the rebellion. It is necessary, and it is\r\n  required, when the interests and rights of another government or of\r\n  its people are so far affected by a pending civil conflict as to\r\n  require a definition of its relations to the parties thereto. But\r\n  this conflict must be one which will be recognized in the sense of\r\n  international law as war. Belligerence, too, is a fact. The mere\r\n  existence of contending armed bodies and their occasional conflicts do\r\n  not constitute war in the sense referred to. Applying to the existing\r\n  condition of affairs in Cuba the tests recognized by publicists and\r\n  writers on international law, and which have been observed by nations\r\n  of dignity, honesty, and power when free from sensitive or selfish and\r\n  unworthy motives, I fail to find in the insurrection the existence of\r\n  such a substantial political organization, real, palpable, and\r\n  manifest to the world, having the forms and capable of the ordinary\r\n  functions of government toward its own people and to other states,\r\n  with courts for the administration of justice, with a local\r\n  habitation, possessing such organization of force, such material, such\r\n  occupation of territory, as to take the contest out of the category of\r\n  a mere rebellious insurrection or occasional skirmishes and place it\r\n  on the terrible footing of war, to which a recognition of belligerency\r\n  would aim to elevate it. The contest, moreover, is solely on land; the\r\n  insurrection has not possessed itself of a single seaport whence it\r\n  may send forth its flag, nor has it any means of communication with\r\n  foreign powers except through the military lines of its adversaries.\r\n  No apprehension of any of those sudden and difficult complications\r\n  which a war upon the ocean is apt to precipitate upon the vessels,\r\n  both commercial and national, and upon the consular officers of other\r\n  powers calls for the definition of their relations to the parties to\r\n  the contest. Considered as a question of expediency, I regard the\r\n  accordance of belligerent rights still to be as unwise and premature\r\n  as I regard it to be, at present, indefensible as a measure of right.\r\n  Such recognition entails upon the country according the rights which\r\n  flow from it difficult and complicated duties, and requires the\r\n  exaction from the contending parties of the strict observance of their\r\n  rights and obligations. It confers the right of search upon the high\r\n  seas by vessels of both parties; it would subject the carrying of arms\r\n  and munitions of war, which now may be transported freely and without\r\n  interruption in the vessels of the United States, to detention and to\r\n  possible seizure; it would give rise to countless vexatious questions,\r\n  would release the parent Government from responsibility for acts done\r\n  by the insurgents, and would invest Spain with the right to exercise\r\n  the supervision recognized by our treaty of 1795 over our commerce on\r\n  the high seas, a very large part of which, in its traffic between the\r\n  Atlantic and the Gulf States and between all of them and the States on\r\n  the Pacific, passes through the waters which wash the shores of Cuba.\r\n  The exercise of this supervision could scarce fail to lead, if not to\r\n  abuses, certainly to collisions perilous to the peaceful relations\r\n  of the two States. There can be little doubt to what result such\r\n  supervision would before long draw this nation. It would be unworthy\r\n  of the United States to inaugurate the possibilities of such result by\r\n  measures of questionable right or expediency or by any indirection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning to the practical aspects of a recognition of belligerency\r\nand reviewing its inconveniences and positive dangers, still further\r\npertinent considerations appear. In the code of nations there is no\r\nsuch thing as a naked recognition of belligerency, unaccompanied by the\r\nassumption of international neutrality. Such recognition, without more,\r\nwill not confer upon either party to a domestic conflict a status not\r\ntheretofore actually possessed or affect the relation of either party to\r\nother states. The act of recognition usually takes the form of a solemn\r\nproclamation of neutrality, which recites the _de facto_ condition\r\nof belligerency as its motive. It announces a domestic law of neutrality\r\nin the declaring state. It assumes the international obligations of a\r\nneutral in the presence of a public state of war. It warns all citizens\r\nand others within the jurisdiction of the proclaimant that they violate\r\nthose rigorous obligations at their own peril and can not expect to be\r\nshielded from the consequences. The right of visit and search on the\r\nseas and seizure of vessels and cargoes and contraband of war and good\r\nprize under admiralty law must under international law be admitted\r\nas a legitimate consequence of a proclamation of belligerency. While\r\naccording the equal belligerent rights defined by public law to each\r\nparty in our ports disfavors would be imposed on both, which, while\r\nnominally equal, would weigh heavily in behalf of Spain herself.\r\nPossessing a navy and controlling the ports of Cuba, her maritime rights\r\ncould be asserted not only for the military investment of the island,\r\nbut up to the margin of our own territorial waters, and a condition of\r\nthings would exist for which the Cubans within their own domain could\r\nnot hope to create a parallel, while its creation through aid or\r\nsympathy from within our domain would be even more impossible than now,\r\nwith the additional obligations of international neutrality we would\r\nperforce assume.\r\n\r\nThe enforcement of this enlarged and onerous code of neutrality would\r\nonly be influential within our own jurisdiction by land and sea and\r\napplicable by our own instrumentalities. It could impart to the United\r\nStates no jurisdiction between Spain and the insurgents. It would give\r\nthe United States no right of intervention to enforce the conduct of the\r\nstrife within the paramount authority of Spain according to the\r\ninternational code of war.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I regard the recognition of the belligerency of the\r\nCuban insurgents as now unwise, and therefore inadmissible. Should that\r\nstep hereafter be deemed wise as a measure of right and duty, the\r\nExecutive will take it.\r\n\r\nIntervention upon humanitarian grounds has been frequently suggested and\r\nhas not failed to receive my most anxious and earnest consideration.\r\nBut should such a step be now taken, when it is apparent that a hopeful\r\nchange has supervened in the policy of Spain toward Cuba? A new\r\ngovernment has taken office in the mother country. It is pledged in\r\nadvance to the declaration that all the effort in the world can not\r\nsuffice to maintain peace in Cuba by the bayonet; that vague promises of\r\nreform after subjugation afford no solution of the insular problem; that\r\nwith a substitution of commanders must come a change of the past system\r\nof warfare for one in harmony with a new policy, which shall no longer\r\naim to drive the Cubans to the \"horrible alternative of taking to the\r\nthicket or succumbing in misery;\" that reforms must be instituted in\r\naccordance with the needs and circumstances of the time, and that these\r\nreforms, while designed to give full autonomy to the colony and to\r\ncreate a virtual entity and self-controlled administration, shall yet\r\nconserve and affirm the sovereignty of Spain by a just distribution of\r\npowers and burdens upon a basis of mutual interest untainted by methods\r\nof selfish expediency.\r\n\r\nThe first acts of the new government lie in these honorable paths.\r\nThe policy of cruel rapine and extermination that so long shocked the\r\nuniversal sentiment of humanity has been reversed. Under the new\r\nmilitary commander a broad clemency is proffered. Measures have already\r\nbeen set on foot to relieve the horrors of starvation. The power of the\r\nSpanish armies, it is asserted, is to be used not to spread ruin and\r\ndesolation, but to protect the resumption of peaceful agricultural\r\npursuits and productive industries. That past methods are futile to\r\nforce a peace by subjugation is freely admitted, and that ruin without\r\nconciliation must inevitably fail to win for Spain the fidelity of a\r\ncontented dependency.\r\n\r\nDecrees in application of the foreshadowed reforms have already been\r\npromulgated. The full text of these decrees has not been received, but\r\nas furnished in a telegraphic summary from our minister are: All civil\r\nand electoral rights of peninsular Spaniards are, in virtue of existing\r\nconstitutional authority, forthwith extended to colonial Spaniards. A\r\nscheme of autonomy has been proclaimed by decree, to become effective\r\nupon ratification by the Cortes. It creates a Cuban parliament, which,\r\nwith the insular executive, can consider and vote upon all subjects\r\naffecting local order and interests, possessing unlimited powers save as\r\nto matters of state, war, and the navy, as to which the Governor-General\r\nacts by his own authority as the delegate of the central Government.\r\nThis parliament receives the oath of the Governor-General to preserve\r\nfaithfully the liberties and privileges of the colony, and to it the\r\ncolonial secretaries are responsible. It has the right to propose to the\r\ncentral Government, through the Governor-General, modifications of the\r\nnational charter and to invite new projects of law or executive measures\r\nin the interest of the colony.\r\n\r\nBesides its local powers, it is competent, first, to regulate electoral\r\nregistration and procedure and prescribe the qualifications of electors\r\nand the manner of exercising suffrage; second, to organize courts of\r\njustice with native judges from members of the local bar; third, to\r\nframe the insular budget, both as to expenditures and revenues, without\r\nlimitation of any kind, and to set apart the revenues to meet the Cuban\r\nshare of the national budget, which latter will be voted by the national\r\nCortes with the assistance of Cuban senators and deputies; fourth, to\r\ninitiate or take part in the negotiations of the national Government for\r\ncommercial treaties which may affect Cuban interests; fifth, to accept\r\nor reject commercial treaties which the national Government may have\r\nconcluded without the participation of the Cuban government; sixth,\r\nto frame the colonial tariff, acting in accord with the peninsular\r\nGovernment in scheduling articles of mutual commerce between the mother\r\ncountry and the colonies. Before introducing or voting upon a bill the\r\nCuban government or the chambers will lay the project before the central\r\nGovernment and hear its opinion thereon, all the correspondence in such\r\nregard being made public. Finally, all conflicts of jurisdiction arising\r\nbetween the different municipal, provincial, and insular assemblies, or\r\nbetween the latter and the insular executive power, and which from their\r\nnature may not be referable to the central Government for decision,\r\nshall be submitted to the courts.\r\n\r\nThat the government of Sagasta has entered upon a course from which\r\nrecession with honor is impossible can hardly be questioned; that in\r\nthe few weeks it has existed it has made earnest of the sincerity of its\r\nprofessions is undeniable. I shall not impugn its sincerity, nor should\r\nimpatience be suffered to embarrass it in the task it has undertaken.\r\nIt is honestly due to Spain and to our friendly relations with Spain\r\nthat she should be given a reasonable chance to realize her expectations\r\nand to prove the asserted efficacy of the new order of things to which\r\nshe stands irrevocably committed. She has recalled the commander whose\r\nbrutal orders inflamed the American mind and shocked the civilized\r\nworld. She has modified the horrible order of concentration and has\r\nundertaken to care for the helpless and permit those who desire to\r\nresume the cultivation of their fields to do so, and assures them of the\r\nprotection of the Spanish Government in their lawful occupations. She\r\nhas just released the _Competitor_ prisoners, heretofore sentenced\r\nto death, and who have been the subject of repeated diplomatic\r\ncorrespondence during both this and the preceding Administration.\r\n\r\nNot a single American citizen is now in arrest or confinement in Cuba of\r\nwhom this Government has any knowledge. The near future will demonstrate\r\nwhether the indispensable condition of a righteous peace, just alike to\r\nthe Cubans and to Spain, as well as equitable to all our interests so\r\nintimately involved in the welfare of Cuba, is likely to be attained. If\r\nnot, the exigency of further and other action by the United States will\r\nremain to be taken. When that time comes, that action will be determined\r\nin the line of indisputable right and duty. It will be faced, without\r\nmisgiving or hesitancy, in the light of the obligation this Government\r\nowes to itself, to the people who have confided to it the protection of\r\ntheir interests and honor, and to humanity.\r\n\r\nSure of the right, keeping free from all offense ourselves, actuated\r\nonly by upright and patriotic considerations, moved neither by passion\r\nnor selfishness, the Government will continue its watchful care over\r\nthe rights and property of American citizens and will abate none of\r\nits efforts to bring about by peaceful agencies a peace which shall\r\nbe honorable and enduring. If it shall hereafter appear to be a duty\r\nimposed by our obligations to ourselves, to civilization, and humanity\r\nto intervene with force, it shall be without fault on our part and only\r\nbecause the necessity for such action will be so clear as to command the\r\nsupport and approval of the civilized world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOINT RESOLUTION appropriating $50,000 for the relief of destitute\r\ncitizens of the United States in the island of Cuba.\r\n\r\n_Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled_, That the sum of $50,000 be,\r\nand the same is hereby, appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury\r\nnot otherwise appropriated, for the relief of destitute citizens of the\r\nUnited States in the island of Cuba, said money to be expended at the\r\ndiscretion and under the direction of the President of the United States\r\nin the purchase and furnishing of food, clothing, and medicines to such\r\ncitizens, and for transporting to the United States such of them as so\r\ndesire and who are without means to transport themselves.\r\n\r\nApproved, May 24, 1897.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See p. 127.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See p. 136.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See Vol. VII, pp. 64-69.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 28, 1898._\r\n\r\n_To the Congress of the United States_:\r\n\r\nFor some time prior to the visit of the _Maine_ to Havana Harbor\r\nour consular representatives pointed out the advantages to flow from the\r\nvisit of national ships to the Cuban waters, in accustoming the people\r\nto the presence of our flag as the symbol of good will and of our ships\r\nin the fulfillment of the mission of protection to American interests,\r\neven though no immediate need therefor might exist.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the 24th of January last, after conference with the\r\nSpanish minister, in which the renewal of visits of our war vessels to\r\nSpanish waters was discussed and accepted, the peninsular authorities at\r\nMadrid and Havana were advised of the purpose of this Government to\r\nresume friendly naval visits at Cuban ports, and that in that view the\r\n_Maine_ would forthwith call at the port of Havana.\r\n\r\nThis announcement was received by the Spanish Government with\r\nappreciation of the friendly character of the visit of the _Maine_\r\nand with notification of intention to return the courtesy by sending\r\nSpanish ships to the principal ports of the United States. Meanwhile the\r\n_Maine_ entered the port of Havana on the 25th of January, her\r\narrival being marked with no special incident besides the exchange of\r\ncustomary salutes and ceremonial visits.\r\n\r\nThe _Maine_ continued in the harbor of Havana during the three\r\nweeks following her arrival. No appreciable excitement attended her\r\nstay. On the contrary, a feeling of relief and confidence followed the\r\nresumption of the long-interrupted friendly intercourse. So noticeable\r\nwas this immediate effect of her visit that the consul-general strongly\r\nurged that the presence of our ships in Cuban waters should be kept up\r\nby retaining the _Maine_ at Havana, or, in the event of her recall,\r\nby sending another vessel there to take her place.\r\n\r\nAt forty minutes past 9 in the evening of the 15th of February the\r\n_Maine_ was destroyed by an explosion, by which the entire forward\r\npart of the ship was utterly wrecked. In this catastrophe 2 officers and\r\n264 of her crew perished, those who were not killed outright by her\r\nexplosion being penned between decks by the tangle of wreckage and\r\ndrowned by the immediate sinking of the hull.\r\n\r\nPrompt assistance was rendered by the neighboring vessels anchored in\r\nthe harbor, aid being especially given by the boats of the Spanish\r\ncruiser _Alfonso XII_ and the Ward Line steamer _City of Washington_,\r\nwhich lay not far distant. The wounded were generously cared for by\r\nthe authorities of Havana, the hospitals being freely opened to them,\r\nwhile the earliest recovered bodies of the dead were interred by the\r\nmunicipality in a public cemetery in the city. Tributes of grief and\r\nsympathy were offered from all official quarters of the island.\r\n\r\nThe appalling calamity fell upon the people of our country with\r\ncrushing force, and for a brief time an intense excitement prevailed,\r\nwhich in a community less just and self-controlled than ours might have\r\nled to hasty acts of blind resentment. This spirit, however, soon gave\r\nway to the calmer processes of reason and to the resolve to investigate\r\nthe facts and await material proof before forming a judgment as to the\r\ncause, the responsibility, and, if the facts warranted, the remedy due.\r\nThis course necessarily recommended itself from the outset to the\r\nExecutive, for only in the light of a dispassionately ascertained\r\ncertainty could it determine the nature and measure of its full duty\r\nin the matter.\r\n\r\nThe usual procedure was followed, as in all cases of casualty or\r\ndisaster to national vessels of any maritime state. A naval court of\r\ninquiry was at once organized, composed of officers well qualified by\r\nrank and practical experience to discharge the onerous duty imposed\r\nupon them. Aided by a strong force of wreckers and divers, the court\r\nproceeded to make a thorough investigation on the spot, employing every\r\navailable means for the impartial and exact determination of the causes\r\nof the explosion. Its operations have been conducted with the utmost\r\ndeliberation and judgment, and, while independently pursued, no\r\nattainable source of information was neglected, and the fullest\r\nopportunity was allowed for a simultaneous investigation by the Spanish\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nThe finding of the court of inquiry was reached, after twenty-three days\r\nof continuous labor, on the 21st of March instant, and, having been\r\napproved on the 22d by the commander in chief of the United States naval\r\nforce on the North Atlantic station, was transmitted to the Executive.\r\n\r\nIt is herewith laid before the Congress, together with the voluminous\r\ntestimony taken before the court.\r\n\r\nIts purport is, in brief, as follows:\r\n\r\nWhen the _Maine_ arrived at Havana, she was conducted by the regular\r\nGovernment pilot to buoy No. 4, to which she was moored in from 5-1/2\r\nto 6 fathoms of water.\r\n\r\nThe state of discipline on board and the condition of her magazines,\r\nboilers, coal bunkers, and storage compartments are passed in review,\r\nwith the conclusion that excellent order prevailed and that no\r\nindication of any cause for an internal explosion existed in any\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nAt 8 o'clock in the evening of February 15 everything had been reported\r\nsecure, and all was quiet.\r\n\r\nAt forty minutes past 9 o'clock the vessel was suddenly destroyed.\r\n\r\nThere were two distinct explosions, with a brief interval between them.\r\nThe first lifted the forward part of the ship very perceptibly; the\r\nsecond, which was more open, prolonged, and of greater volume, is\r\nattributed by the court to the partial explosion of two or more of the\r\nforward magazines.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of the divers establishes that the after part of the ship\r\nwas practically intact and sank in that condition a very few moments\r\nafter the explosion. The forward part was completely demolished.\r\n\r\nUpon the evidence of a concurrent external cause the finding of the\r\ncourt is as follows:\r\n\r\nAt frame 17 the outer shell of the ship, from a point 11-1/2 feet from\r\nthe middle line of the ship and 6 feet above the keel when in its normal\r\nposition, has been forced up so as to be now about 4 feet above the\r\nsurface of the water, therefore about 34 feet above where it would be\r\nhad the ship sunk uninjured.\r\n\r\nThe outside bottom plating is bent into a reversed V shape (*A), the\r\nafter wing of which, about 15 feet broad and 32 feet in length (from\r\nframe 17 to frame 25), is doubled back upon itself against the\r\ncontinuation of the same plating, extending forward.\r\n\r\nAt frame 18 the vertical keel is broken in two and the flat keel bent\r\ninto an angle similar to the angle formed by the outside bottom plates.\r\nThis break is now about 6 feet below the surface of the water and about\r\n30 feet above its normal position.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of the court this effect could have been produced only by\r\nthe explosion of a mine situated under the bottom of the ship at about\r\nframe 18 and somewhat on the port side of the ship.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conclusions of the court are:\r\n\r\nThat the loss of the _Maine_ was not in any respect due to fault or\r\nnegligence on the part of any of the officers or members of her crew;\r\n\r\nThat the ship was destroyed by the explosion of a submarine mine, which\r\ncaused the partial explosion of two or more of her forward magazines;\r\nand\r\n\r\nThat no evidence has been obtainable fixing the responsibility for the\r\ndestruction of the _Maine_ upon any person or persons.\r\n\r\nI have directed that the finding of the court of inquiry and the views\r\nof this Government thereon be communicated to the Government of Her\r\nMajesty the Queen Regent, and I do not permit myself to doubt that the\r\nsense of justice of the Spanish nation will dictate a course of action\r\nsuggested by honor and the friendly relations of the two Governments.\r\n\r\nIt will be the duty of the Executive to advise the Congress of the\r\nresult, and in the meantime deliberate consideration is invoked.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 11, 1898_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress of the United States:_\r\n\r\nObedient to that precept of the Constitution which commands the\r\nPresident to give from time to time to the Congress information of the\r\nstate of the Union and to recommend to their consideration such measures\r\nas he shall judge necessary and expedient, it becomes my duty to now\r\naddress your body with regard to the grave crisis that has arisen in the\r\nrelations of the United States to Spain by reason of the warfare that\r\nfor more than three years has raged in the neighboring island of Cuba.\r\n\r\nI do so because of the intimate connection of the Cuban question with\r\nthe state of our own Union and the grave relation the course which\r\nit is now incumbent upon the nation to adopt must needs bear to the\r\ntraditional policy of our Government if it is to accord with the\r\nprecepts laid down by the founders of the Republic and religiously\r\nobserved by succeeding Administrations to the present day.\r\n\r\nThe present revolution is but the successor of other similar\r\ninsurrections which have occurred in Cuba against the dominion of Spain,\r\nextending over a period of nearly half a century, each of which during\r\nits progress has subjected the United States to great effort and expense\r\nin enforcing its neutrality laws, caused enormous losses to American\r\ntrade and commerce, caused irritation, annoyance, and disturbance among\r\nour citizens, and, by the exercise of cruel, barbarous, and uncivilized\r\npractices of warfare, shocked the sensibilities and offended the humane\r\nsympathies of our people.\r\n\r\nSince the present revolution began, in February, 1895, this country has\r\nseen the fertile domain at our threshold ravaged by fire and sword in\r\nthe course of a struggle unequaled in the history of the island and\r\nrarely paralleled as to the numbers of the combatants and the bitterness\r\nof the contest by any revolution of modern times where a dependent\r\npeople striving to be free have been opposed by the power of the\r\nsovereign state.\r\n\r\nOur people have beheld a once prosperous community reduced to\r\ncomparative want, its lucrative commerce virtually paralyzed, its\r\nexceptional productiveness diminished, its fields laid waste, its mills\r\nin ruins, and its people perishing by tens of thousands from hunger and\r\ndestitution. We have found ourselves constrained, in the observance\r\nof that strict neutrality which our laws enjoin and which the law of\r\nnations commands, to police our own waters and watch our own seaports\r\nin prevention of any unlawful act in aid of the Cubans.\r\n\r\nOur trade has suffered, the capital invested by our citizens in Cuba\r\nhas been largely lost, and the temper and forbearance of our people\r\nhave been so sorely tried as to beget a perilous unrest among our own\r\ncitizens, which has inevitably found its expression from time to time in\r\nthe National Legislature, so that issues wholly external to our own body\r\npolitic engross attention and stand in the way of that close devotion to\r\ndomestic advancement that becomes a self-contained commonwealth whose\r\nprimal maxim has been the avoidance of all foreign entanglements. All\r\nthis must needs awaken, and has, indeed, aroused, the utmost concern on\r\nthe part of this Government, as well during my predecessor's term as in\r\nmy own.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1896, the evils from which our country suffered through the\r\nCuban war became so onerous that my predecessor made an effort to bring\r\nabout a peace through the mediation of this Government in any way that\r\nmight tend to an honorable adjustment of the contest between Spain\r\nand her revolted colony, on the basis of some effective scheme of\r\nself-government for Cuba under the flag and sovereignty of Spain. It\r\nfailed through the refusal of the Spanish government then in power to\r\nconsider any form of mediation or, indeed, any plan of settlement which\r\ndid not begin with the actual submission of the insurgents to the mother\r\ncountry, and then only on such terms as Spain herself might see fit to\r\ngrant. The war continued unabated. The resistance of the insurgents was\r\nin no wise diminished.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of Spain were increased, both by the dispatch of fresh\r\nlevies to Cuba and by the addition to the horrors of the strife of\r\na new and inhuman phase happily unprecedented in the modern history\r\nof civilized Christian peoples. The policy of devastation and\r\nconcentration, inaugurated by the Captain-General's _bando_ of\r\nOctober 21, 1896, in the Province of Pinar del Rio was thence extended\r\nto embrace all of the island to which the power of the Spanish arms was\r\nable to reach by occupation or by military operations. The peasantry,\r\nincluding all dwelling in the open agricultural interior, were driven\r\ninto the garrison towns or isolated places held by the troops.\r\n\r\nThe raising and movement of provisions of all kinds were interdicted.\r\nThe fields were laid waste, dwellings unroofed and fired, mills\r\ndestroyed, and, in short, everything that could desolate the land and\r\nrender it unfit for human habitation or support was commanded by one or\r\nthe other of the contending parties and executed by all the powers at\r\ntheir disposal.\r\n\r\nBy the time the present Administration took office, a year ago,\r\nreconcentration (so called) had been made effective over the better part\r\nof the four central and western provinces--Santa Clara, Matanzas,\r\nHavana, and Pinar del Rio.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural population to the estimated number of 300,000 or more\r\nwas herded within the towns and their immediate vicinage, deprived of\r\nthe means of support, rendered destitute of shelter, left poorly clad,\r\nand exposed to the most unsanitary conditions. As the scarcity of food\r\nincreased with the devastation of the depopulated areas of production,\r\ndestitution and want became misery and starvation. Month by month the\r\ndeath rate increased in an alarming ratio. By March, 1897, according to\r\nconservative estimates from official Spanish sources, the mortality\r\namong the reconcentrados from starvation and the diseases thereto\r\nincident exceeded 50 per cent of their total number.\r\n\r\nNo practical relief was accorded to the destitute. The overburdened\r\ntowns, already suffering from the general dearth, could give no aid.\r\nSo-called \"zones of cultivation\" established within the immediate areas\r\nof effective military control about the cities and fortified camps\r\nproved illusory as a remedy for the suffering. The unfortunates, being\r\nfor the most part women and children, with aged and helpless men,\r\nenfeebled by disease and hunger, could not have tilled the soil without\r\ntools, seed, or shelter for their own support or for the supply of the\r\ncities. Reconcentration, adopted avowedly as a war measure in order to\r\ncut off the resources of the insurgents, worked its predestined result.\r\nAs I said in my message of last December, it was not civilized warfare;\r\nit was extermination. The only peace it could beget was that of the\r\nwilderness and the grave.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the military situation in the island had undergone a\r\nnoticeable change. The extraordinary activity that characterized the\r\nsecond year of the war, when the insurgents invaded even the thitherto\r\nunharmed fields of Pinar del Rio and carried havoc and destruction up\r\nto the walls of the city of Havana itself, had relapsed into a dogged\r\nstruggle in the central and eastern provinces. The Spanish arms regained\r\na measure of control in Pinar del Rio and parts of Havana, but, under\r\nthe existing conditions of the rural country, without immediate\r\nimprovement of their productive situation. Even thus partially\r\nrestricted, the revolutionists held their own, and their conquest and\r\nsubmission, put forward by Spain as the essential and sole basis of\r\npeace, seemed as far distant as at the outset.\r\n\r\nIn this state of affairs my Administration found itself confronted with\r\nthe grave problem of its duty. My message of last December[4] reviewed\r\nthe situation and narrated the steps taken with a view to relieving its\r\nacuteness and opening the way to some form of honorable settlement. The\r\nassassination of the prime minister, Canovas, led to a change of\r\ngovernment in Spain. The former administration, pledged to subjugation\r\nwithout concession, gave place to that of a more liberal party,\r\ncommitted long in advance to a policy of reform involving the wider\r\nprinciple of home rule for Cuba and Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nThe overtures of this Government made through its new envoy, General\r\nWoodford, and looking to an immediate and effective amelioration of the\r\ncondition of the island, although not accepted to the extent of admitted\r\nmediation in any shape, were met by assurances that home rule in an\r\nadvanced phase would be forthwith offered to Cuba, without waiting for\r\nthe war to end, and that more humane methods should thenceforth prevail\r\nin the conduct of hostilities. Coincidentally with these declarations\r\nthe new government of Spain continued and completed the policy, already\r\nbegun by its predecessor, of testifying friendly regard for this nation\r\nby releasing American citizens held under one charge or another\r\nconnected with the insurrection, so that by the end of November not a\r\nsingle person entitled in any way to our national protection remained in\r\na Spanish prison.\r\n\r\nWhile these negotiations were in progress the increasing destitution of\r\nthe unfortunate reconcentrados and the alarming mortality among them\r\nclaimed earnest attention. The success which had attended the limited\r\nmeasure of relief extended to the suffering American citizens among them\r\nby the judicious expenditure through the consular agencies of the money\r\nappropriated expressly for their succor by the joint resolution approved\r\nMay 24, 1897,[5] prompted the humane extension of a similar scheme of\r\naid to the great body of sufferers. A suggestion to this end was\r\nacquiesced in by the Spanish authorities.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of December last I caused to be issued an appeal to the\r\nAmerican people inviting contributions in money or in kind for the\r\nsuccor of the starving sufferers in Cuba, following this on the 8th of\r\nJanuary by a similar public announcement of the formation of a central\r\nCuban relief committee, with headquarters in New York City, composed of\r\nthree members representing the American National Red Cross and the\r\nreligious and business elements of the community.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of that committee have been untiring and have accomplished\r\nmuch. Arrangements for free transportation to Cuba have greatly aided\r\nthe charitable work. The president of the American Red Cross and\r\nrepresentatives of other contributory organizations have generously\r\nvisited Cuba and cooperated with the consul-general and the local\r\nauthorities to make effective distribution of the relief collected\r\nthrough the efforts of the central committee. Nearly $200,000 in money\r\nand supplies has already reached the sufferers, and more is forthcoming.\r\nThe supplies are admitted duty free, and transportation to the interior\r\nhas been arranged, so that the relief, at first necessarily confined to\r\nHavana and the larger cities, is now extended through most, if not all,\r\nof the towns where suffering exists.\r\n\r\nThousands of lives have already been saved. The necessity for a change\r\nin the condition of the reconcentrados is recognized by the Spanish\r\nGovernment. Within a few days past the orders of General Weyler have\r\nbeen revoked. The reconcentrados, it is said, are to be permitted to\r\nreturn to their homes and aided to resume the self-supporting pursuits\r\nof peace. Public works have been ordered to give them employment and a\r\nsum of $600,000 has been appropriated for their relief.\r\n\r\nThe war in Cuba is of such a nature that, short of subjugation or\r\nextermination, a final military victory for either side seems\r\nimpracticable. The alternative lies in the physical exhaustion of the\r\none or the other party, or perhaps of both--a condition which in effect\r\nended the ten years' war by the truce of Zanjon. The prospect of such a\r\nprotraction and conclusion of the present strife is a contingency hardly\r\nto be contemplated with equanimity by the civilized world, and least of\r\nall by the United States, affected and injured as we are, deeply and\r\nintimately, by its very existence.\r\n\r\nRealizing this, it appeared to be my duty, in a spirit of true\r\nfriendliness, no less to Spain than to the Cubans, who have so much to\r\nlose by the prolongation of the struggle, to seek to bring about an\r\nimmediate termination of the war. To this end I submitted on the 27th\r\nultimo, as a result of much representation and correspondence, through\r\nthe United States minister at Madrid, propositions to the Spanish\r\nGovernment looking to an armistice until October 1 for the negotiation\r\nof peace with the good offices of the President.\r\n\r\nIn addition I asked the immediate revocation of the order of\r\nreconcentration, so as to permit the people to return to their farms and\r\nthe needy to be relieved with provisions and supplies from the United\r\nStates, cooperating with the Spanish authorities, so as to afford full\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nThe reply of the Spanish cabinet was received on the night of the\r\n31st ultimo. It offered, as the means to bring about peace in Cuba,\r\nto confide the preparation thereof to the insular parliament, inasmuch\r\nas the concurrence of that body would be necessary to reach a final\r\nresult, it being, however, understood that the powers reserved by the\r\nconstitution to the central Government are not lessened or diminished.\r\nAs the Cuban parliament does not meet until the 4th of May next, the\r\nSpanish Government would not object for its part to accept at once\r\na suspension of hostilities if asked for by the insurgents from the\r\ngeneral in chief, to whom it would pertain in such case to determine\r\nthe duration and conditions of the armistice.\r\n\r\nThe propositions submitted by General Woodford and the reply of the\r\nSpanish Government were both in the form of brief memoranda, the texts\r\nof which are before me and are substantially in the language above\r\ngiven. The function of the Cuban parliament in the matter of \"preparing\"\r\npeace and the manner of its doing so are not expressed in the Spanish\r\nmemorandum, but from General Woodford's explanatory reports of\r\npreliminary discussions preceding the final conference it is understood\r\nthat the Spanish Government stands ready to give the insular congress\r\nfull powers to settle the terms of peace with the insurgents, whether by\r\ndirect negotiation or indirectly by means of legislation does not\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nWith this last overture in the direction of immediate peace, and its\r\ndisappointing reception by Spain, the Executive is brought to the end of\r\nhis effort.\r\n\r\nIn my annual message of December last I said:\r\n\r\n  Of the untried measures there remain only: Recognition of the insurgents\r\n  as belligerents; recognition of the independence of Cuba; neutral\r\n  intervention to end the war by imposing a rational compromise between\r\n  the contestants, and intervention in favor of one or the other party.\r\n  I speak not of forcible annexation, for that can not be thought of.\r\n  That, by our code of morality, would be criminal aggression.\r\n\r\n\r\nThereupon I reviewed these alternatives in the light of President\r\nGrant's measured words, uttered in 1875, when, after seven years of\r\nsanguinary, destructive, and cruel hostilities in Cuba, he reached the\r\nconclusion that the recognition of the independence of Cuba was\r\nimpracticable and indefensible and that the recognition of belligerence\r\nwas not warranted by the facts according to the tests of public law.\r\nI commented especially upon the latter aspect of the question, pointing\r\nout the inconveniences and positive dangers of a recognition of\r\nbelligerence, which, while adding to the already onerous burdens of\r\nneutrality within our own jurisdiction, could not in any way extend our\r\ninfluence or effective offices in the territory of hostilities.\r\n\r\nNothing has since occurred to change my view in this regard, and\r\nI recognize as fully now as then that the issuance of a proclamation of\r\nneutrality, by which process the so-called recognition of belligerents\r\nis published, could of itself and unattended by other action accomplish\r\nnothing toward the one end for which we labor--the instant pacification\r\nof Cuba and the cessation of the misery that afflicts the island.\r\n\r\nTurning to the question of recognizing at this time the independence\r\nof the present insurgent government in Cuba, we find safe precedents\r\nin our history from an early day. They are well summed up in President\r\nJackson's message to Congress, December 21, 1836, on the subject of the\r\nrecognition of the independence of Texas. He said:\r\n\r\n  In all the contests that have arisen out of the revolutions of France,\r\n  out of the disputes relating to the crowns of Portugal and Spain, out\r\n  of the revolutionary movements of those Kingdoms, out of the separation\r\n  of the American possessions of both from the European Governments, and\r\n  out of the numerous and constantly occurring struggles for dominion in\r\n  Spanish America, so wisely consistent with our just principles has been\r\n  the action of our Government that we have under the most critical\r\n  circumstances avoided all censure and encountered no other evil than\r\n  that produced by a transient estrangement of good will in those against\r\n  whom we have been by force of evidence compelled to decide.\r\n\r\n  It has thus been made known to the world that the uniform policy and\r\n  practice of the United States is to avoid all interference in disputes\r\n  which merely relate to the internal government of other nations, and\r\n  eventually to recognize the authority of the prevailing party, without\r\n  reference to our particular interests and views or to the merits of the\r\n  original controversy.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  * * * But on this as on every trying occasion safety is to be found in\r\n  a rigid adherence to principle.\r\n\r\n  In the contest between Spain and her revolted colonies we stood aloof\r\n  and waited, not only until the ability of the new States to protect\r\n  themselves was fully established, but until the danger of their being\r\n  again subjugated had entirely passed away. Then, and not till then, were\r\n  they recognized. Such was our course in regard to Mexico herself. * * *\r\n  It is true that, with regard to Texas, the civil authority of Mexico has\r\n  been expelled, its invading army defeated, the chief of the Republic\r\n  himself captured, and all present power to control the newly organized\r\n  Government of Texas annihilated within its confines. But, on the other\r\n  hand, there is, in appearance at least, an immense disparity of physical\r\n  force on the side of Mexico. The Mexican Republic under another\r\n  Executive is rallying its forces under a new leader and menacing a fresh\r\n  invasion to recover its lost dominion.\r\n\r\n  Upon the issue of this threatened invasion the independence of Texas\r\n  may be considered as suspended, and were there nothing peculiar in the\r\n  relative situation of the United States and Texas our acknowledgment\r\n  of its independence at such a crisis could scarcely be regarded as\r\n  consistent with that prudent reserve with which we have heretofore\r\n  held ourselves bound to treat all similar questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThereupon Andrew Jackson proceeded to consider the risk that there might\r\nbe imputed to the United States motives of selfish interest in view of\r\nthe former claim on our part to the territory of Texas and of the avowed\r\npurpose of the Texans in seeking recognition of independence as an\r\nincident to the incorporation of Texas in the Union, concluding thus:\r\n\r\nPrudence, therefore, seems to dictate that we should still stand aloof\r\nand maintain our present attitude, if not until Mexico itself or one of\r\nthe great foreign powers shall recognize the independence of the new\r\nGovernment, at least until the lapse of time or the course of events\r\nshall have proved beyond cavil or dispute the ability of the people of\r\nthat country to maintain their separate sovereignty and to uphold the\r\nGovernment constituted by them. Neither of the contending parties can\r\njustly complain of this course. By pursuing it we are but carrying\r\nout the long-established policy of our Government--a policy which\r\nhas secured to us respect and influence abroad and inspired confidence\r\nat home.\r\n\r\nThese are the words of the resolute and patriotic Jackson. They are\r\nevidence that the United States, in addition to the test imposed by\r\npublic law as the condition of the recognition of independence by a\r\nneutral state (to wit, that the revolted state shall \"constitute in fact\r\na body politic, having a government in substance as well as in name,\r\npossessed of the elements of stability,\" and forming _de facto_,\r\n\"if left to itself, a state among the nations, reasonably capable of\r\ndischarging the duties of a state\"), has imposed for its own governance\r\nin dealing with cases like these the further condition that recognition\r\nof independent statehood is not due to a revolted dependency until the\r\ndanger of its being again subjugated by the parent state has entirely\r\npassed away.\r\n\r\nThis extreme test was, in fact, applied in the case of Texas.\r\nThe Congress to whom President Jackson referred the question as\r\none \"probably leading to war,\" and therefore a proper subject for\r\n\"a previous understanding with that body by whom war can alone be\r\ndeclared and by whom all the provisions for sustaining its perils must\r\nbe furnished,\" left the matter of the recognition of Texas to the\r\ndiscretion of the Executive, providing merely for the sending of a\r\ndiplomatic agent when the President should be satisfied that the\r\nRepublic of Texas had become \"an independent state.\" It was so\r\nrecognized by President Van Buren, who commissioned a chargé d'affaires\r\nMarch 7, 1837, after Mexico had abandoned an attempt to reconquer the\r\nTexan territory, and when there was at the time no _bona fide_\r\ncontest going on between the insurgent province and its former\r\nsovereign.\r\n\r\nI said in my message of December last:\r\n\r\n  It is to be seriously considered whether the Cuban insurrection\r\n  possesses beyond dispute the attributes of statehood, which alone\r\n  can demand the recognition of belligerency in its favor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same requirement must certainly be no less seriously considered\r\nwhen the graver issue of recognizing independence is in question, for\r\nno less positive test can be applied to the greater act than to the\r\nlesser, while, on the other hand, the influences and consequences of the\r\nstruggle upon the internal policy of the recognizing state, which form\r\nimportant factors when the recognition of belligerency is concerned, are\r\nsecondary, if not rightly eliminable, factors when the real question is\r\nwhether the community claiming recognition is or is not independent\r\nbeyond peradventure.\r\n\r\nNor from the standpoint of expediency do I think it would be wise\r\nor prudent for this Government to recognize at the present time the\r\nindependence of the so-called Cuban Republic. Such recognition is not\r\nnecessary in order to enable the United States to intervene and pacify\r\nthe island. To commit this country now to the recognition of any\r\nparticular government in Cuba might subject us to embarrassing\r\nconditions of international obligation toward the organization so\r\nrecognized. In case of intervention our conduct would be subject to the\r\napproval or disapproval of such government. We would be required to\r\nsubmit to its direction and to assume to it the mere relation of a\r\nfriendly ally.\r\n\r\nWhen it shall appear hereafter that there is within the island a\r\ngovernment capable of performing the duties and discharging the\r\nfunctions of a separate nation, and having as a matter of fact the\r\nproper forms and attributes of nationality, such government can be\r\npromptly and readily recognized and the relations and interests of the\r\nUnited States with such nation adjusted.\r\n\r\nThere remain the alternative forms of intervention to end the war,\r\neither as an impartial neutral, by imposing a rational compromise\r\nbetween the contestants, or as the active ally of the one party or the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nAs to the first, it is not to be forgotten that during the last few\r\nmonths the relation of the United States has virtually been one of\r\nfriendly intervention in many ways, each not of itself conclusive, but\r\nall tending to the exertion of a potential influence toward an ultimate\r\npacific result, just and honorable to all interests concerned. The\r\nspirit of all our acts hitherto has been an earnest, unselfish desire\r\nfor peace and prosperity in Cuba, untarnished by differences between us\r\nand Spain and unstained by the blood of American citizens.\r\n\r\nThe forcible intervention of the United States as a neutral to stop the\r\nwar, according to the large dictates of humanity and following many\r\nhistorical precedents where neighboring states have interfered to check\r\nthe hopeless sacrifices of life by internecine conflicts beyond their\r\nborders, is justifiable on rational grounds. It involves, however,\r\nhostile constraint upon both the parties to the contest, as well to\r\nenforce a truce as to guide the eventual settlement.\r\n\r\nThe grounds for such intervention may be briefly summarized as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst. In the cause of humanity and to put an end to the barbarities,\r\nbloodshed, starvation, and horrible miseries now existing there, and\r\nwhich the parties to the conflict are either unable or unwilling to stop\r\nor mitigate. It is no answer to say this is all in another country,\r\nbelonging to another nation, and is therefore none of our business.\r\nIt is specially our duty, for it is right at our door.\r\n\r\nSecond. We owe it to our citizens in Cuba to afford them that protection\r\nand indemnity for life and property which no government there can or\r\nwill afford, and to that end to terminate the conditions that deprive\r\nthem of legal protection.\r\n\r\nThird. The right to intervene may be justified by the very serious\r\ninjury to the commerce, trade, and business of our people and by the\r\nwanton destruction of property and devastation of the island.\r\n\r\nFourth, and which is of the utmost importance. The present condition of\r\naffairs in Cuba is a constant menace to our peace and entails upon this\r\nGovernment an enormous expense. With such a conflict waged for years\r\nin an island so near us and with which our people have such trade and\r\nbusiness relations; when the lives and liberty of our citizens are in\r\nconstant danger and their property destroyed and themselves ruined;\r\nwhere our trading vessels are liable to seizure and are seized at\r\nour very door by war ships of a foreign nation; the expeditions of\r\nfilibustering that we are powerless to prevent altogether, and the\r\nirritating questions and entanglements thus arising--all these and\r\nothers that I need not mention, with the resulting strained relations,\r\nare a constant menace to our peace and compel us to keep on a semi war\r\nfooting with a nation with which we are at peace.\r\n\r\nThese elements of danger and disorder already pointed out have been\r\nstrikingly illustrated by a tragic event which has deeply and justly\r\nmoved the American people. I have already transmitted to Congress the\r\nreport of the naval court of inquiry on the destruction of the battle\r\nship _Maine_ in the harbor of Havana during the night of the 15th\r\nof February.[6] The destruction of that noble vessel has filled the\r\nnational heart with inexpressible horror. Two hundred and fifty-eight\r\nbrave sailors and marines and two officers of our Navy, reposing in the\r\nfancied security of a friendly harbor, have been hurled to death, grief\r\nand want brought to their homes and sorrow to the nation.\r\n\r\nThe naval court of inquiry, which, it is needless to say, commands\r\nthe unqualified confidence of the Government, was unanimous in its\r\nconclusion that the destruction of the _Maine_ was caused by an\r\nexterior explosion--that of a submarine mine. It did not assume to\r\nplace the responsibility. That remains to be fixed.\r\n\r\nIn any event, the destruction of the _Maine_, by whatever exterior\r\ncause, is a patent and impressive proof of a state of things in Cuba\r\nthat is intolerable. That condition is thus shown to be such that the\r\nSpanish Government can not assure safety and security to a vessel of the\r\nAmerican Navy in the harbor of Havana on a mission of peace, and\r\nrightfully there.\r\n\r\nFurther referring in this connection to recent diplomatic\r\ncorrespondence, a dispatch from our minister to Spain of the 26th ultimo\r\ncontained the statement that the Spanish minister for foreign affairs\r\nassured him positively that Spain will do all that the highest honor\r\nand justice require in the matter of the _Maine_. The reply above\r\nreferred to, of the 31st ultimo, also contained an expression of the\r\nreadiness of Spain to submit to an arbitration all the differences which\r\ncan arise in this matter, which is subsequently explained by the note of\r\nthe Spanish minister at Washington of the 10th instant, as follows:\r\n\r\n  As to the question of fact which springs from the diversity of views\r\n  between the reports of the American and Spanish boards, Spain proposes\r\n  that the facts be ascertained by an impartial investigation by experts,\r\n  whose decision Spain accepts in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this I have made no reply.\r\n\r\nPresident Grant, in 1875, after discussing the phases of the contest as\r\nit then appeared and its hopeless and apparent indefinite prolongation,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n  In such event I am of opinion that other nations will be compelled to\r\n  assume the responsibility which devolves upon them, and to seriously\r\n  consider the only remaining measures possible--mediation and\r\n  intervention. Owing, perhaps, to the large expanse of water separating\r\n  the island from the peninsula, * * * the contending parties appear to\r\n  have within themselves no depository of common confidence to suggest\r\n  wisdom when passion and excitement have their sway and to assume the\r\n  part of peacemaker. In this view in the earlier days of the contest the\r\n  good offices of the United States as a mediator were tendered in good\r\n  faith, without any selfish purpose, in the interest of humanity and in\r\n  sincere friendship for both parties, but were at the time declined by\r\n  Spain, with the declaration, nevertheless, that at a future time they\r\n  would be indispensable. No intimation has been received that in the\r\n  opinion of Spain that time has been reached. And yet the strife\r\n  continues, with all its dread horrors and all its injuries to the\r\n  interests of the United States and of other nations. Each party seems\r\n  quite capable of working great injury and damage to the other, as well\r\n  as to all the relations and interests dependent on the existence of\r\n  peace in the island; but they seem incapable of reaching any adjustment,\r\n  and both have thus far failed of achieving any success whereby one party\r\n  shall possess and control the island to the exclusion of the other.\r\n  Under these circumstances the agency of others, either by mediation or\r\n  by intervention, seems to be the only alternative which must, sooner or\r\n  later, be invoked for the termination of the strife.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last annual message of my immediate predecessor, during the\r\npending struggle, it was said:\r\n\r\n  When the inability of Spain to deal successfully with the insurrection\r\n  has become manifest and it is demonstrated that her sovereignty is\r\n  extinct in Cuba for all purposes of its rightful existence, and when a\r\n  hopeless struggle for its reestablishment has degenerated into a strife\r\n  which means nothing more than the useless sacrifice of human life and\r\n  the utter destruction of the very subject-matter of the conflict, a\r\n  situation will be presented in which our obligations to the sovereignty\r\n  of Spain will be superseded by higher obligations, which we can hardly\r\n  hesitate to recognize and discharge.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my annual message to Congress December last, speaking to this\r\nquestion, I said:\r\n\r\n  The near future will demonstrate whether the indispensable condition of\r\n  a righteous peace, just alike to the Cubans and to Spain, as well as\r\n  equitable to all our interests so intimately involved in the welfare\r\n  of Cuba, is likely to be attained. If not, the exigency of further and\r\n  other action by the United States will remain to be taken. When that\r\n  time conies, that action will be determined in the line of indisputable\r\n  right and duty. It will be faced, without misgiving or hesitancy, in\r\n  the light of the obligation this Government owes to itself, to the\r\n  people who have confided to it the protection of their interests and\r\n  honor, and to humanity.\r\n\r\n  Sure of the right, keeping free from all offense ourselves, actuated\r\n  only by upright and patriotic considerations, moved neither by passion\r\n  nor selfishness, the Government will continue its watchful care over\r\n  the rights and property of American citizens and will abate none of\r\n  its efforts to bring about by peaceful agencies a peace which shall\r\n  be honorable and enduring. If it shall hereafter appear to be a duty\r\n  imposed by our obligations to ourselves, to civilization, and humanity\r\n  to intervene with force, it shall be without fault on our part and only\r\n  because the necessity for such action will be so clear as to command\r\n  the support and approval of the civilized world.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe long trial has proved that the object for which Spain has waged\r\nthe war can not be attained. The fire of insurrection may flame or may\r\nsmolder with varying seasons, but it has not been and it is plain that\r\nit can not be extinguished by present methods. The only hope of relief\r\nand repose from a condition which can no longer be endured is the\r\nenforced pacification of Cuba. In the name of humanity, in the name of\r\ncivilization, in behalf of endangered American interests which give us\r\nthe right and the duty to speak and to act, the war in Cuba must stop.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts and of these considerations I ask the Congress\r\nto authorize and empower the President to take measures to secure a full\r\nand final termination of hostilities between the Government of Spain\r\nand the people of Cuba, and to secure in the island the establishment\r\nof a stable government, capable of maintaining order and observing its\r\ninternational obligations, insuring peace and tranquillity and the\r\nsecurity of its citizens as well as our own, and to use the military\r\nand naval forces of the United States as may be necessary for these\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nAnd in the interest of humanity and to aid in preserving the lives of\r\nthe starving people of the island I recommend that the distribution of\r\nfood and supplies be continued and that an appropriation be made out of\r\nthe public Treasury to supplement the charity of our citizens.\r\n\r\nThe issue is now with the Congress. It is a solemn responsibility.\r\nI have exhausted every effort to relieve the intolerable condition of\r\naffairs which is at our doors. Prepared to execute every obligation\r\nimposed upon me by the Constitution and the law, I await your action.\r\n\r\nYesterday, and since the preparation of the foregoing message, official\r\ninformation was received by me that the latest decree of the Queen\r\nRegent of Spain directs General Blanco, in order to prepare and\r\nfacilitate peace, to proclaim a suspension of hostilities, the duration\r\nand details of which have not yet been communicated to me.\r\n\r\nThis fact, with every other pertinent consideration, will, I am sure,\r\nhave your just and careful attention in the solemn deliberations upon\r\nwhich you are about to enter. If this measure attains a successful\r\nresult, then our aspirations as a Christian, peace-loving people will be\r\nrealized. If it fails, it will be only another justification for our\r\ncontemplated action.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: See pp. 127-136.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: See p. 136.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: See pp. 136-139.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, April 11, 1898_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in response to a resolution of the Senate of the\r\n14th of February last, calling for information and correspondence in\r\nregard to the condition of the island of Cuba and to negotiations for\r\ncommercial relations between the United States and that island, a report\r\nof the Secretary of State, with its accompanying correspondence,\r\ncovering the first inquiry of the resolution, together with a report\r\nof the special commissioner plenipotentiary charged with commercial\r\nnegotiations under the provisions of the tariff act approved July 24,\r\n1897, in response to the second inquiry.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE, _Washington_, _April 11, 1898_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State has had the honor to receive, by reference from\r\nthe President, a resolution adopted in the Senate of the United States\r\non the 14th of February last, reading as follows:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved,_ That the President is requested, if in his opinion it\r\nis not incompatible with the public service, to send to the Senate\r\ncopies of the reports of the consul-general and of the consuls of the\r\nUnited States in Cuba written or received since March 4, 1897, which\r\nrelate to the state of war in that island and the condition of the\r\npeople there, or that he will send such parts of said reports as will\r\ninform the Senate as to these facts.\r\n\r\n\"Second. That the President inform the Senate whether any agent of a\r\ngovernment in Cuba has been accredited to this Government or the\r\nPresident of the United States with authority to negotiate a treaty of\r\nreciprocity with the United States, or any other diplomatic or\r\ncommercial agreement with the United States, and whether such person has\r\nbeen recognized and received as the representative of such government in\r\nCuba.\"\r\n\r\nThis resolution contemplates answer being made to two separable\r\ninquiries: First, in relation to the present condition of affairs in\r\nCuba, and, secondly, with regard to the action had in view of the\r\novertures of the Government of Spain for a reciprocal commercial\r\nagreement covering particularly the trade between the United States and\r\nthe island of Cuba.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of commercial negotiations under the authority and in\r\naccordance with the conditions found in sections 3, 4, and 5 of the\r\nexisting tariff act, approved July 24, 1897, having been intrusted to a\r\nspecial commissioner plenipotentiary duly empowered by the President to\r\nthat end, it has been deemed convenient to leave to the commissioner the\r\npreparation of a report in answer to the second part of the Senate\r\nresolution, the undersigned reserving to himself the response to the\r\nfirst part thereof, which concerns the political and consular functions\r\nof the Department of State. The separate report of the Hon. John A.\r\nKasson, special commissioner plenipotentiary, is therefore herewith\r\nindependently submitted to the President with a view to its transmission\r\nto the Senate, should such a course be, in the President's judgment, not\r\nincompatible with the public service.\r\n\r\nThe Senate resolution, while in terms calling for the submission to that\r\nhonorable body of all or of a practical selection of the reports of the\r\nconsul-general and consuls of the United States in Cuba written or\r\nreceived since March 4, 1897, which relate to the state of war in that\r\nisland and the condition of the people there, appears to leave it to the\r\ndiscretion of the President to direct the scope of the information to be\r\nso reported and the manner of its communication. The undersigned, having\r\ntaken the President's direction on both these points, has the honor to\r\nlay before him a selection of the correspondence received by the\r\nDepartment of State from the various consular representatives in Cuba,\r\naiming thereby to show the present situation in the island rather than\r\nto give a historical account of all the reported incidents since the\r\ndate assigned by the resolution.\r\n\r\nRespectfully submitted.\r\n\r\nJOHN SHERMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON,\r\n\r\n_Office of Special Commissioner Plenipotentiary_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\nIn response to the following resolution of the Senate, passed under date\r\nof February 14, 1898, and which was referred to the undersigned for\r\nreport, viz--\r\n\r\n\"Second. That the President inform the Senate whether any agent of\r\na government in Cuba has been accredited to this Government or the\r\nPresident of the United States with authority to negotiate a treaty\r\nof reciprocity with the United States, or any other diplomatic or\r\ncommercial agreement with the United States, and whether such person has\r\nbeen recognized and received as the representative of such government\r\nin Cuba\"--\r\n\r\nI have the honor to submit the following report:\r\n\r\nIn October, 1897, the minister of Spain at this capital verbally advised\r\nthe undersigned that so soon as the new government in Spain had leisure\r\nto take up the question he would probably be authorized to enter into\r\nnegotiations with the undersigned for reciprocal trade arrangements with\r\nSpain, and that a representative of Cuba would probably be associated\r\nfor the interests of that island.\r\n\r\nUnder date of December 9, 1897, the minister of the United States at\r\nMadrid was instructed to ascertain the disposition of the Spanish\r\nGovernment in respect to these negotiations.\r\n\r\nUnder date of January 24, 1898, a dispatch from Mr. Woodford (referred\r\nto this office) advised the Secretary of State that arrangements were\r\nmade for the negotiation of a commercial treaty between Spain and the\r\nUnited States; that separate provisions would be made for Cuba, and that\r\nthe Cuban insular government would appoint a delegate to represent that\r\nisland in the negotiations. This was accompanied by a memorandum from\r\nthe Spanish minister of colonies, stating that the same rules as for\r\nCuba might be applied to Puerto Rico, and suggesting a basis for the\r\nnegotiations. This communication was referred to this office on the 4th\r\nof February.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of February the Spanish minister, Mr. Dupuy de Lôme, called\r\non the undersigned and announced that he was authorized to represent\r\nSpain in the pending negotiations and that a special representative\r\nwould arrive from Cuba, under appointment of the insular government, to\r\nact as far as the interests of that island were involved. He mentioned\r\nthe name of Señor Angulo as the gentleman who had been suggested in Cuba\r\nfor that appointment; but the delegate was not officially notified to\r\nthis office.\r\n\r\nOn March 17 a note from the Spanish minister, Señor Polo y Bernabé,\r\naddressed, under date of the 16th instant, to the Secretary of State,\r\nwas referred to this office. In that note his excellency advised this\r\nGovernment of his appointment by Her Majesty the Queen Regent of Spain\r\nto conduct these negotiations, assisted by Señor Manuel Rafael Angulo as\r\nspecial delegate of the insular government of Cuba, who would be aided\r\nby two technical assistants, also appointed by the Cuban government;\r\nand, further, that an officer from the treasury department would be\r\nadded in the same character.\r\n\r\nHis excellency announced his readiness to commence the labors of the\r\ncommission so soon as the Government of the United States should\r\nformulate the general plan for carrying on the work.\r\n\r\nRespectfully submitted, March 17, 1898.\r\n\r\nJOHN A KASSON,\r\n\r\n_Special Commissioner Plenipotenitary_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 12, 1898_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn response to a resolution of the Senate of the 4th instant, I inclose\r\nherewith a letter from the Secretary of the Navy, inclosing a copy of a\r\nreport from the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAVY DEPARTMENT, _Washington, April 9, 1898_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Senate resolution of\r\nApril 4, directing that the Senate be informed \"of the total number of\r\nhuman lives that were lost by the sinking of the United States battle\r\nship _Maine_ in Havana Harbor, Cuba, on the 15th day of February,\r\n1898, the total number of dead bodies rescued from said ship, the total\r\nnumber remaining unrescued, and what effort, if any, is being made to\r\nrescue them,\" and in reply thereto inclose a copy of a report from the\r\nChief of the Bureau of Navigation covering the above inquiry.

No estimate has been made of the portions of\r\nbodies which were recovered and buried. The large percentage of bodies\r\nnot recovered is due, no doubt, to the fact that the men were swinging\r\nin their hammocks immediately over that portion of the vessel which was\r\ntotally destroyed.\r\n\r\nA.S. CROWNINSHIELD,\r\n\r\n_Chief of Bureau_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, April 25, 1898_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of\r\nAmerica_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Congress, for its consideration and appropriate\r\naction, copies of correspondence recently had with the representative of\r\nSpain in the United States, with the United States minister at Madrid,\r\nand through the latter with the Government of Spain, showing the action\r\ntaken under the joint resolution approved April 20, 1898, \"for the\r\nrecognition of the independence of the people of Cuba, demanding that\r\nthe Government of Spain relinquish its authority and government in the\r\nisland of Cuba and to withdraw its land and naval forces from Cuba and\r\nCuban waters, and directing the President of the United States to use\r\nthe land and naval forces of the United States to carry these\r\nresolutions in to effect.\"[7]\r\n\r\nUpon communicating to the Spanish minister in Washington the demand\r\nwhich it became the duty of the Executive to address to the Government\r\nof Spain in obedience to said resolution, the minister asked for his\r\npassports and withdrew. The United States minister at Madrid was in turn\r\nnotified by the Spanish minister for foreign affairs that the withdrawal\r\nof the Spanish representative from the United States had terminated\r\ndiplomatic relations between the two countries, and that all official\r\ncommunications between their respective representatives ceased\r\ntherewith.\r\n\r\nI commend to your especial attention the note addressed to the United\r\nStates minister at Madrid by the Spanish minister for foreign affairs\r\non the 21st instant, whereby the foregoing notification was conveyed.\r\nIt will be perceived therefrom that the Government of Spain, having\r\ncognizance of the joint resolution of the United States Congress,\r\nand in view of the things which the President is thereby required and\r\nauthorized to do, responds by treating the reasonable demands of this\r\nGovernment as measures of hostility, following with that instant and\r\ncomplete severance of relations by its action which by the usage of\r\nnations accompanies an existent state of war between sovereign powers.\r\n\r\nThe position of Spain being thus made known and the demands of the\r\nUnited States being denied, with a complete rupture of intercourse,\r\nby the act of Spain, I have been constrained, in exercise of the power\r\nand authority conferred upon me by the joint resolution aforesaid, to\r\nproclaim, under date of April 22, 1898,[8] a blockade of certain ports\r\nof the north coast of Cuba lying between Cardenas and Bahia Honda, and\r\nof the port of Cienfuegos, on the south coast of Cuba, and further in\r\nexercise of my constitutional powers and using the authority conferred\r\nupon me by the act of Congress approved April 22, 1898, to issue my\r\nproclamation dated April 23, 1898,[9] calling forth volunteers in order\r\nto carry into effect the said resolution of April 20, 1898. Copies of\r\nthese proclamations are hereto appended.\r\n\r\nIn view of the measures so taken, and with a view to the adoption of\r\nsuch other measures as may be necessary to enable me to carry out the\r\nexpressed will of the Congress of the United States in the premises, I\r\nnow recommend to your honorable body the adoption of a joint resolution\r\ndeclaring that a state of war exists between the United States of\r\nAmerica and the Kingdom of Spain, and I urge speedy action thereon, to\r\nthe end that the definition of the international status of the United\r\nStates as a belligerent power may be made known and the assertion of all\r\nits rights and the maintenance of all its duties in the conduct of a\r\npublic war may be assured.[10]\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: See p. 155.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: See pp. 202-203.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: See pp. 203-204.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: See p. 201.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJOINT RESOLUTION for the recognition of the independence of the people\r\nof Cuba, demanding that the Government of Spain relinquish its authority\r\nand government in the island of Cuba and to withdraw its land and naval\r\nforces from Cuba and Cuban waters, and directing the President of the\r\nUnited States to use the land and naval forces of the United States to\r\ncarry these resolutions into effect.\r\n\r\nWhereas the abhorrent conditions which have existed for more than three\r\nyears in the island of Cuba, so near our own borders, have shocked the\r\nmoral sense of the people of the United States, have been a disgrace to\r\nChristian civilization, culminating, as they have, in the destruction of\r\na United States battle ship, with 266 of its officers and crew, while on\r\na friendly visit in the harbor of Havana, and can not longer be endured,\r\nas has been set forth by the President of the United States in his\r\nmessage to Congress of April 11, 1898,[11] upon which the action of\r\nCongress was invited: Therefore,\r\n\r\n_Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled_, First. That the people of\r\nthe island of Cuba are and of right ought to be free and independent.\r\n\r\nSecond. That it is the duty of the United States to demand, and the\r\nGovernment of the United States does hereby demand, that the Government\r\nof Spain at once relinquish its authority and government in the island\r\nof Cuba and withdraw its land and naval forces from Cuba and Cuban\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nThird. That the President of the United States be, and he hereby is,\r\ndirected and empowered to use the entire land and naval forces of the\r\nUnited States and to call into the actual service of the United States\r\nthe militia of the several States to such extent as may be necessary to\r\ncarry these resolutions into effect.\r\n\r\nFourth. That the United States hereby disclaims any disposition or\r\nintention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over\r\nsaid island except for the pacification thereof, and asserts its\r\ndetermination, when that is accomplished, to leave the government\r\nand control of the island to its people.\r\n\r\nApproved, April 20, 1898.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: See pp. 139-150.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 9, 1898_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress of the United States:_\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of April I directed the Secretary of the Navy to telegraph\r\norders to Commodore George Dewey, of the United States Navy, commanding\r\nthe Asiatic Squadron, then lying in the port of Hongkong, to proceed\r\nforthwith to the Philippine Islands, there-to commence operations and\r\nengage the assembled Spanish fleet.\r\n\r\nPromptly obeying that order, the United States squadron, consisting of\r\nthe flagship _Olympia_, _Baltimore_, _Raleigh_, _Boston_, _Concord_, and\r\n_Petrel_, with the revenue cutter _McCulloch_ as an auxiliary dispatch\r\nboat, entered the harbor of Manila at daybreak on the 1st of May and\r\nimmediately engaged the entire Spanish fleet of eleven ships, which were\r\nunder the protection of the fire of the land forts. After a stubborn\r\nfight, in which the enemy suffered great loss, these vessels were\r\ndestroyed or completely disabled and the water battery at Cavite\r\nsilenced. Of our brave officers and men not one was lost and only eight\r\ninjured, and those slightly. All of our ships escaped any serious\r\ndamage.\r\n\r\nBy the 4th of May Commodore Dewey had taken possession of the naval\r\nstation at Cavite, destroying the fortifications there and at the\r\nentrance of the bay and paroling their garrisons. The waters of the bay\r\nare under his complete control. He has established hospitals within the\r\nAmerican lines, where 250 of the Spanish sick and wounded are assisted\r\nand protected.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of this victory can hardly be measured by the ordinary\r\nstandard of naval warfare. Outweighing any material advantage is the\r\nmoral effect of this initial success. At this unsurpassed achievement\r\nthe great heart of our nation throbs, not with boasting or with greed of\r\nconquest, but with deep gratitude that this triumph has come in a just\r\ncause and that by the grace of God an effective step has thus been taken\r\ntoward the attainment of the wished-for peace. To those whose skill,\r\ncourage, and devotion have won the fight, to the gallant commander and\r\nthe brave officers and men who aided him, our country owes an\r\nincalculable debt.\r\n\r\nFeeling as our people feel, and speaking in their name, I at once sent\r\na message to Commodore Dewey thanking him and his officers and men for\r\ntheir splendid achievement and overwhelming victory and informing him\r\nthat I had appointed him an acting rear-admiral.\r\n\r\nI now recommend that, following our national precedents and expressing\r\nthe fervent gratitude of every patriotic heart, the thanks of Congress\r\nbe given Acting Rear-Admiral George Dewey, of the United States Navy,\r\nfor highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the enemy, and to\r\nthe officers and men under his command for their gallantry in the\r\ndestruction of the enemy's fleet and the capture of the enemy's\r\nfortifications in the bay of Manila.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 1, 1898_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress of the United States:_\r\n\r\nThe resolution of Congress passed May 9, 1898, tendering to Commodore\r\nGeorge Dewey, United States Navy, commander in chief of the United\r\nStates naval force on the Asiatic station, the thanks of Congress and of\r\nthe American people for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with\r\nthe enemy, as displayed by him in the destruction of the Spanish fleet\r\nand batteries in the harbor of Manila, Philippine Islands, May 1, 1898,\r\nand through him extending the thanks of Congress and of the American\r\npeople to the officers and men under his command for gallantry and\r\nskill exhibited by them on that occasion, required the President to\r\ncommunicate the same to Commodore Dewey, and through him to the officers\r\nand men under his command. This having been done, through the Secretary\r\nof the Navy, on the 15th of May, 1898, the following response has been\r\nreceived and is hereby transmitted to the Congress:\r\n\r\nI desire to express to the Department, and to request that it will be\r\ntransmitted to the President and to Congress, my most sincere thanks for\r\nthe great compliment paid to me.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOINT RESOLUTION tendering the thanks of Congress to Commodore George\r\nDewey, United States Navy, and to the officers and men of the squadron\r\nunder his command.\r\n\r\n_Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled_, That, in pursuance of the\r\nrecommendation of the President, made in accordance with the provisions\r\nof section 1508 of the Revised Statutes, the thanks of Congress and\r\nof the American people are hereby tendered to Commodore George Dewey,\r\nUnited States Navy, commander in chief of the United States naval force\r\non the Asiatic station, for highly distinguished conduct in conflict\r\nwith the enemy, as displayed by him in the destruction of the Spanish\r\nfleet and batteries in the harbor of Manila, Philippine Islands, May 1,\r\n1898.\r\n\r\nSEC. 2. That the thanks of Congress and the American people are hereby\r\nextended through Commodore Dewey to the officers and men under his\r\ncommand for the gallantry and skill exhibited by them on that occasion.\r\n\r\nSEC. 3. _Be it further resolved_, That the President of the United\r\nStates be requested to cause this resolution to be communicated to\r\nCommodore Dewey, and through him to the officers and men under his\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nApproved, May 10, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOINT RESOLUTION authorizing the Secretary of the Navy to present a\r\nsword of honor to Commodore George Dewey, and to cause to be struck\r\nbronze medals commemorating the battle of Manila Bay, and to distribute\r\nsuch medals to the officers and men of the ships of the Asiatic Squadron\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\n_Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled_, That the Secretary of the\r\nNavy be, and he hereby is, authorized to present a sword of honor to\r\nCommodore George Dewey, and to cause to be struck bronze medals\r\ncommemorating the battle of Manila Bay, and to distribute such medals to\r\nthe officers and men of the ships of the Asiatic Squadron of the United\r\nStates under command of Commodore George Dewey on May 1, 1898; and that\r\nto enable the Secretary to carry out this resolution the sum of $10,000,\r\nor so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby appropriated out of\r\nany money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated.\r\n\r\nApproved, June 3, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 27, 1898_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress of the United States:_\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of May, 1898, there occurred a conflict in the bay of\r\nCardenas, Cuba, in which the naval torpedo boat _Winslow_ was\r\ndisabled, her commander wounded, and one of her officers and a part\r\nof her crew killed by the enemy's fire.\r\n\r\nIn the face of a most galling fire from the enemy's guns the revenue\r\ncutter _Hudson_, commanded by First Lieutenant Frank H. Newcomb,\r\nUnited States Revenue-Cutter Service, rescued the disabled\r\n_Winslow_, her wounded commander and remaining crew. The commander\r\nof the _Hudson_ kept his vessel in the very hottest fire of the\r\naction, although in constant danger of going ashore on account of the\r\nshallow water, until he finally got a line made fast to the\r\n_Winslow_ and towed that vessel out of range of the enemy's guns--a\r\ndeed of special gallantry.\r\n\r\nI recommend that in recognition of the signal act of heroism of First\r\nLieutenant Frank H. Newcomb, United States Revenue-Cutter Service, above\r\nset forth, the thanks of Congress be extended to him and to his officers\r\nand men of the _Hudson_, and that a gold medal of honor be\r\npresented to Lieutenant Newcomb, a silver medal of honor to each of his\r\nofficers, and a bronze medal of honor to each member of his crew who\r\nserved with him at Cardenas.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Congress by appropriate action recognized the\r\nseveral commanders of ships of war for their services in the battle of\r\nManila, May 1, 1898.\r\n\r\nThe commander of the revenue cutter _Hugh McCulloch_, present and\r\nin active cooperation with the fleet under Commodore Dewey on that\r\noccasion (by Executive order under the provisions of section 2757,\r\nRevised Statutes), is the only commander of a national ship to whom\r\npromotion or advancement was not and could not be given, because he\r\nalready held the highest rank known to the Revenue-Cutter Service.\r\n\r\nI now recommend that in recognition of the efficient and meritorious\r\nservices of Captain Daniel B. Hodgsdon, United States Revenue-Cutter\r\nService, who commanded the _Hugh McCulloch_ at the battle of Manila\r\n(that officer being now in the sixty-third year of his age and having\r\nserved continuously on active duty for thirty-seven years), he be placed\r\nupon the permanent waiting-orders or retired list of the Revenue-Cutter\r\nService on the full-duty pay of his grade.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 27, 1898_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress of the United States:_\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 3d of June, 1898, Assistant Naval Constructor\r\nRichmond P. Hobson, United States Navy, with a volunteer crew of seven\r\nmen, in charge of the partially dismantled collier _Merrimac_,\r\nentered the fortified harbor of Santiago, Cuba, for the purpose of\r\nsinking the collier in the narrowest portion of the channel, and thus\r\ninterposing a serious obstacle to the egress of the Spanish fleet which\r\nhad recently entered that harbor. This enterprise, demanding coolness,\r\njudgment, and bravery amounting to heroism, was carried into successful\r\nexecution in the face of a persistent fire from the hostile fleet as\r\nwell as from the fortifications on shore.\r\n\r\nRear-Admiral Sampson, commander in chief of our naval force in Cuban\r\nwaters, in an official report dated \"Off Santiago de Cuba, June 3,\r\n1898,\" and addressed to the Secretary of the Navy, referring to Mr.\r\nHobson's gallant exploit, says:\r\n\r\n  As stated in a recent telegram, before coming here I decided to make the\r\n  harbor entrance secure against the possibility of egress of the Spanish\r\n  ships by obstructing the narrow part of the entrance by sinking a\r\n  collier at that point. Upon calling upon Mr. Hobson for his professional\r\n  opinion as to a sure method of sinking the ship, he manifested a most\r\n  lively interest in the problem. After several days' consideration he\r\n  presented a solution which he considered would insure the immediate\r\n  sinking of the ship when she had reached the desired point in the\r\n  channel. * * * The plan contemplated a crew of only seven men and Mr.\r\n  Hobson, who begged that it might be intrusted to him.\r\n\r\n  As soon as I reached Santiago and had the collier to work upon, the\r\n  details were commenced and diligently prosecuted, hoping to complete\r\n  them in one day, as the moon and tide served best the first night after\r\n  our arrival. Notwithstanding every effort, the hour of 4 o'clock in the\r\n  morning arrived and the preparations were scarcely completed. After a\r\n  careful inspection of the final preparations I was forced to relinquish\r\n  the plan for that morning, as dawn was breaking. Mr. Hobson begged to\r\n  try it at all hazards.\r\n\r\n  This morning proved more propitious, as a prompt start could be made.\r\n  Nothing could have been more gallantly executed. * * * A careful\r\n  inspection of the harbor from this ship showed that the _Merrimac_\r\n  had been sunk in the channel.\r\n\r\n  I can not myself too earnestly express my appreciation of the conduct of\r\n  Mr. Hobson and his gallant crew. I venture to say that a more brave and\r\n  daring thing has not been done since Cushing blew up the _Albemarle_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe members of the crew who were with Mr. Hobson on this memorable\r\noccasion have already been rewarded for their services by advancement,\r\nwhich, under the provisions of law and regulations, the Secretary of the\r\nNavy was authorized to make; and the nomination to the Senate of Naval\r\nCadet Powell, who in a steam launch followed the _Merrimac_ on her\r\nperilous trip for the purpose of rescuing her force after the sinking of\r\nthat vessel, to be advanced in rank to the grade of ensign has been\r\nprepared and will be submitted.\r\n\r\nCushing, with whose gallant act in blowing up the ram _Albemarle_\r\nduring the Civil War Admiral Sampson compares Mr. Hobson's sinking of\r\nthe _Merrimac_, received the thanks of Congress, upon recommendation\r\nof the President, by name, and was in consequence, under the provisions\r\nof section 1508 of the Revised Statutes, advanced one grade, such\r\nadvancement embracing 56 numbers. The section cited applies, however, to\r\nline officers only, and Mr. Hobson, being a member of the staff of the\r\nNavy, could not under its provisions be so advanced.\r\n\r\nIn considering the question of suitably rewarding Assistant Naval\r\nConstructor Hobson for his valiant conduct on the occasion referred\r\nto, I have deemed it proper to address this message to you with the\r\nrecommendation that he receive the thanks of Congress and, further, that\r\nhe be transferred to the line of the Navy and promoted to such position\r\ntherein as the President, by and with the advice and consent of the\r\nSenate, may determine. Mr. Hobson's transfer from the construction\r\ncorps to the line is fully warranted, he having received the necessary\r\ntechnical training as a graduate of the Naval Academy, where he stood\r\nNo. 1 in his class; and such action is recommended partly in deference\r\nto what is understood to be his own desire, although, he being now a\r\nprisoner in the hands of the enemy, no direct communication on the\r\nsubject has been received from him, and partly for the reason that the\r\nabilities displayed by him at Santiago are of such a character as to\r\nindicate especial fitness for the duties of the line.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 5, 1898_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the added burdens rendered necessary by the war, our\r\npeople rejoice in a very satisfactory and steadily increasing degree of\r\nprosperity, evidenced by the largest volume of business ever recorded.\r\nManufacture has been productive, agricultural pursuits have yielded\r\nabundant returns, labor in all fields of industry is better rewarded,\r\nrevenue legislation passed by the present Congress has increased the\r\nTreasury's receipts to the amount estimated by its authors, the finances\r\nof the Government have been successfully administered and its credit\r\nadvanced to the first rank, while its currency has been maintained at\r\nthe world's highest standard. Military service under a common flag and\r\nfor a righteous cause has strengthened the national spirit and served to\r\ncement more closely than ever the fraternal bonds between every section\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nA review of the relation of the United States to other powers, always\r\nappropriate, is this year of primary importance in view of the momentous\r\nissues which have arisen, demanding in one instance the ultimate\r\ndetermination by arms and involving far-reaching consequences which will\r\nrequire the earnest attention of the Congress.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message[12] very full consideration was given to the\r\nquestion of the duty of the Government of the United States toward Spain\r\nand the Cuban insurrection as being by far the most important problem\r\nwith which we were then called upon to deal. The considerations then\r\nadvanced and the exposition of the views therein expressed disclosed\r\nmy sense of the extreme gravity of the situation. Setting aside as\r\nlogically unfounded or practically inadmissible the recognition of the\r\nCuban insurgents as belligerents, the recognition of the independence\r\nof Cuba, neutral intervention to end the war by imposing a rational\r\ncompromise between the contestants, intervention in favor of one or the\r\nother party, and forcible annexation of the island, I concluded it was\r\nhonestly due to our friendly relations with Spain that she should be\r\ngiven a reasonable chance to realize her expectations of reform to which\r\nshe had become irrevocably committed. Within a few weeks previously she\r\nhad announced comprehensive plans which it was confidently asserted\r\nwould be efficacious to remedy the evils so deeply affecting our own\r\ncountry, so injurious to the true interests of the mother country as\r\nwell as to those of Cuba, and so repugnant to the universal sentiment\r\nof humanity.\r\n\r\nThe ensuing month brought little sign of real progress toward the\r\npacification of Cuba. The autonomous administrations set up in the\r\ncapital and some of the principal cities appeared not to gain the favor\r\nof the inhabitants nor to be able to extend their influence to the large\r\nextent of territory held by the insurgents, while the military arm,\r\nobviously unable to cope with the still active rebellion, continued many\r\nof the most objectionable and offensive policies of the government that\r\nhad preceded it. No tangible relief was afforded the vast numbers of\r\nunhappy reconcentrados, despite the reiterated professions made in that\r\nregard and the amount appropriated by Spain to that end. The proffered\r\nexpedient of zones of cultivation proved illusory. Indeed no less\r\npractical nor more delusive promises of succor could well have been\r\ntendered to the exhausted and destitute people, stripped of all that\r\nmade life and home dear and herded in a strange region among\r\nunsympathetic strangers hardly less necessitous than themselves.\r\n\r\nBy the end of December the mortality among them had frightfully\r\nincreased. Conservative estimates from Spanish sources placed the deaths\r\namong these distressed people at over 40 per cent from the time General\r\nWeyler's decree of reconcentration was enforced. With the acquiescence\r\nof the Spanish authorities, a scheme was adopted for relief by\r\ncharitable contributions raised in this country and distributed, under\r\nthe direction of the consul-general and the several consuls, by noble\r\nand earnest individual effort through the organized agencies of the\r\nAmerican Red Cross. Thousands of lives were thus saved, but many\r\nthousands more were inaccessible to such forms of aid.\r\n\r\nThe war continued on the old footing, without comprehensive plan,\r\ndeveloping only the same spasmodic encounters, barren of strategic\r\nresult, that had marked the course of the earlier ten years' rebellion\r\nas well as the present insurrection from its start. No alternative save\r\nphysical exhaustion of either combatant, and therewithal the practical\r\nruin of the island, lay in sight, but how far distant no one could\r\nventure to conjecture.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, on the 15th of February last, occurred the destruction\r\nof the battle ship _Maine_ while rightfully lying in the harbor of\r\nHavana on a mission of international courtesy and good will--a\r\ncatastrophe the suspicious nature and horror of which stirred the\r\nnation's heart profoundly. It is a striking evidence of the poise and\r\nsturdy good sense distinguishing our national character that this\r\nshocking blow, falling upon a generous people already deeply touched by\r\npreceding events in Cuba, did not move them to an instant desperate\r\nresolve to tolerate no longer the existence of a condition of danger and\r\ndisorder at our doors that made possible such a deed, by whomsoever\r\nwrought. Yet the instinct of justice prevailed, and the nation anxiously\r\nawaited the result of the searching investigation at once set on foot.\r\nThe finding of the naval board of inquiry established that the origin of\r\nthe explosion was external, by a submarine mine, and only halted through\r\nlack of positive testimony to fix the responsibility of its authorship.\r\n\r\nAll these things carried conviction to the most thoughtful, even before\r\nthe finding of the naval court, that a crisis in our relations with\r\nSpain and toward Cuba was at hand. So strong was this belief that it\r\nneeded but a brief Executive suggestion to the Congress to receive\r\nimmediate answer to the duty of making instant provision for the\r\npossible and perhaps speedily probable emergency of war, and the\r\nremarkable, almost unique, spectacle was presented of a unanimous vote\r\nof both Houses, on the 9th of March, appropriating $50,000,000 \"for the\r\nnational defense and for each and every purpose connected therewith,\r\nto be expended at the discretion of the President.\" That this act of\r\nprevision came none too soon was disclosed when the application of the\r\nfund was undertaken. Our coasts were practically undefended. Our Navy\r\nneeded large provision for increased ammunition and supplies, and even\r\nnumbers to cope with any sudden attack from the navy of Spain, which\r\ncomprised modern vessels of the highest type of continental perfection.\r\nOur Army also required enlargement of men and munitions. The details\r\nof the hurried preparation for the dreaded contingency are told in the\r\nreports of the Secretaries of War and of the Navy, and need not be\r\nrepeated here. It is sufficient to say that the outbreak of war when\r\nit did come found our nation not unprepared to meet the conflict.\r\n\r\nNor was the apprehension of coming strife confined to our own country.\r\nIt was felt by the continental powers, which on April 6, through their\r\nambassadors and envoys, addressed to the Executive an expression of hope\r\nthat humanity and moderation might mark the course of this Government\r\nand people, and that further negotiations would lead to an agreement\r\nwhich, while securing the maintenance of peace, would afford all\r\nnecessary guaranties for the reestablishment of order in Cuba. In\r\nresponding to that representation I said I shared the hope the envoys\r\nhad expressed that peace might be preserved in a manner to terminate the\r\nchronic condition of disturbance in Cuba, so injurious and menacing to\r\nour interests and tranquillity, as well as shocking to our sentiments\r\nof humanity; and while appreciating the humanitarian and disinterested\r\ncharacter of the communication they had made on behalf of the powers,\r\nI stated the confidence of this Government, for its part, that equal\r\nappreciation would be shown for its own earnest and unselfish endeavors\r\nto fulfill a duty to humanity by ending a situation the indefinite\r\nprolongation of which had become insufferable.\r\n\r\nStill animated by the hope of a peaceful solution and obeying the\r\ndictates of duty, no effort was relaxed to bring about a speedy\r\nending of the Cuban struggle. Negotiations to this object continued\r\nactively with the Government of Spain, looking to the immediate\r\nconclusion of a six months' armistice in Cuba, with a view to effect\r\nthe recognition of her people's right to independence. Besides this,\r\nthe instant revocation of the order of reconcentration was asked,\r\nso that the sufferers, returning to their homes and aided by united\r\nAmerican and Spanish effort, might be put in a way to support\r\nthemselves and, by orderly resumption of the well-nigh destroyed\r\nproductive energies of the island, contribute to the restoration of\r\nits tranquillity and well-being. Negotiations continued for some little\r\ntime at Madrid, resulting in offers by the Spanish Government which\r\ncould not but be regarded as inadequate. It was proposed to confide the\r\npreparation of peace to the insular parliament, yet to be convened under\r\nthe autonomous decrees of November, 1897, but without impairment in any\r\nwise of the constitutional powers of the Madrid Government, which to\r\nthat end would grant an armistice, if solicited by the insurgents, for\r\nsuch time as the general in chief might see fit to fix. How and with\r\nwhat scope of discretionary powers the insular parliament was expected\r\nto set about the \"preparation\" of peace did not appear. If it were to be\r\nby negotiation with the insurgents, the issue seemed to rest on the one\r\nside with a body chosen by a fraction of the electors in the districts\r\nunder Spanish control, and on the other with the insurgent population\r\nholding the interior country, unrepresented in the so-called parliament\r\nand defiant at the suggestion of suing for peace.\r\n\r\nGrieved and disappointed at this barren outcome of my sincere endeavors\r\nto reach a practicable solution, I felt it my duty to remit the whole\r\nquestion to the Congress. In the message of April 11, 1898,[13] I\r\nannounced that with this last overture in the direction of immediate\r\npeace in Cuba and its disappointing reception by Spain the effort of\r\nthe Executive was brought to an end. I again reviewed the alternative\r\ncourses of action which had been proposed, concluding that the only one\r\nconsonant with international policy and compatible with our firm-set\r\nhistorical traditions was intervention as a neutral to stop the war and\r\ncheck the hopeless sacrifice of life, even though that resort involved\r\n\"hostile constraint upon both the parties to the contest, as well to\r\nenforce a truce as to guide the eventual settlement.\" The grounds\r\njustifying that step were the interests of humanity, the duty to protect\r\nthe life and property of our citizens in Cuba, the right to check injury\r\nto our commerce and people through the devastation of the island, and,\r\nmost important, the need of removing at once and forever the constant\r\nmenace and the burdens entailed upon our Government by the uncertainties\r\nand perils of the situation caused by the unendurable disturbance in\r\nCuba. I said:\r\n\r\n  The long trial has proved that the object for which Spain has waged\r\n  the war can not be attained. The fire of insurrection may flame or may\r\n  smolder with varying seasons, but it has not been and it is plain that\r\n  it can not be extinguished by present methods. The only hope of relief\r\n  and repose from a condition which can no longer be endured is the\r\n  enforced pacification of Cuba. In the name of humanity, in the name of\r\n  civilization, in behalf of endangered American interests which give us\r\n  the right and the duty to speak and to act, the war in Cuba must stop.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of all this the Congress was asked to authorize and empower the\r\nPresident to take measures to secure a full and final termination of\r\nhostilities between Spain and the people of Cuba and to secure in the\r\nisland the establishment of a stable government, capable of maintaining\r\norder and observing its international obligations, insuring peace and\r\ntranquillity and the security of its citizens as well as our own, and\r\nfor the accomplishment of those ends to use the military and naval\r\nforces of the United States as might be necessary, with added authority\r\nto continue generous relief to the starving people of Cuba.\r\n\r\nThe response of the Congress, after nine days of earnest deliberation,\r\nduring which the almost unanimous sentiment of your body was developed\r\non every point save as to the expediency of coupling the proposed action\r\nwith a formal recognition of the Republic of Cuba as the true and lawful\r\ngovernment of that island--a proposition which failed of adoption--the\r\nCongress, after conference, on the 19th of April, by a vote of 42 to 35\r\nin the Senate and 311 to 6 in the House of Representatives, passed the\r\nmemorable joint resolution declaring--\r\n\r\n  First. That the people of the island of Cuba are, and of right ought\r\n  to be, free and independent.\r\n\r\n  Second. That it is the duty of the United States to demand, and the\r\n  Government of the United States does hereby demand, that the Government\r\n  of Spain at once relinquish its authority and government in the island\r\n  of Cuba and withdraw its land and naval forces from Cuba and Cuban\r\n  waters.\r\n\r\n  Third. That the President of the United States be, and he hereby is,\r\n  directed and empowered to use the entire land and naval forces of the\r\n  United States and to call into the actual service of the United States\r\n  the militia of the several States to such extent as may be necessary\r\n  to carry these resolutions into effect.\r\n\r\n  Fourth. That the United States hereby disclaims any disposition or\r\n  intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over\r\n  said island except for the pacification thereof, and asserts its\r\n  determination when that is accomplished to leave the government and\r\n  control of the island to its people.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis resolution was approved by the Executive on the next day, April 20.\r\nA copy was at once communicated to the Spanish minister at this capital,\r\nwho forthwith announced that his continuance in Washington had thereby\r\nbecome impossible, and asked for his passports, which were given him.\r\nHe thereupon withdrew from Washington, leaving the protection of\r\nSpanish interests in the United States to the French ambassador and the\r\nAustro-Hungarian minister. Simultaneously with its communication to\r\nthe Spanish minister here, General Woodford, the American minister at\r\nMadrid, was telegraphed confirmation of the text of the joint resolution\r\nand directed to communicate it to the Government of Spain with the\r\nformal demand that it at once relinquish its authority and government\r\nin the island of Cuba and withdraw its forces therefrom, coupling this\r\ndemand with announcement of the intentions of this Government as to\r\nthe future of the island, in conformity with the fourth clause of the\r\nresolution, and giving Spain until noon of April 23 to reply.\r\n\r\nThat demand, although, as above shown, officially made known to the\r\nSpanish envoy here, was not delivered at Madrid. After the instruction\r\nreached General Woodford on the morning of April 21, but before he could\r\npresent it, the Spanish minister of state notified him that upon the\r\nPresident's approval of the joint resolution the Madrid Government,\r\nregarding the act as \"equivalent to an evident declaration of war,\" had\r\nordered its minister in Washington to withdraw, thereby breaking off\r\ndiplomatic relations between the two countries and ceasing all official\r\ncommunication between their respective representatives. General Woodford\r\nthereupon demanded his passports and quitted Madrid the same day.\r\n\r\nSpain having thus denied the demand of the United States and initiated\r\nthat complete form of rupture of relations which attends a state of war,\r\nthe executive powers authorized by the resolution were at once used by\r\nme to meet the enlarged contingency of actual war between sovereign\r\nstates. On April 22 I proclaimed a blockade of the north coast of Cuba,\r\nincluding ports on said coast between Cardenas and Bahia Honda, and the\r\nport of Cienfuegos, on the south coast of Cuba,[14] and on the 23d I\r\ncalled for volunteers to execute the purpose of the resolution.[15] By\r\nmy message of April 25 the Congress was informed of the situation, and\r\nI recommended formal declaration of the existence of a state of war\r\nbetween the United States and Spain. [16] The Congress accordingly voted\r\non the same day the act approved April 25, 1898, declaring the existence\r\nof such war from and including the 21st day of April,[17] and reenacted\r\nthe provision of the resolution of April 20 directing the President\r\nto use all the armed forces of the nation to carry that act into\r\neffect.[18] Due notification of the existence of war as aforesaid was\r\ngiven April 25 by telegraph to all the governments with which the\r\nUnited States maintain relations, in order that their neutrality\r\nmight be assured during the war. The various governments responded with\r\nproclamations of neutrality, each after its own methods. It is not among\r\nthe least gratifying incidents of the struggle that the obligations of\r\nneutrality were impartially discharged by all, often under delicate and\r\ndifficult circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn further fulfillment of international duty I issued, April 26, 1898, a\r\nproclamation announcing the treatment proposed to be accorded to vessels\r\nand their cargoes as to blockade, contraband, the exercise of the right\r\nof search, and the immunity of neutral flags and neutral goods under\r\nenemy's flag.[19] A similar proclamation was made by the Spanish\r\nGovernment. In the conduct of hostilities the rules of the Declaration\r\nof Paris, including abstention from resort to privateering, have\r\naccordingly been observed by both belligerents, although neither was a\r\nparty to that declaration.\r\n\r\nOur country thus, after an interval of half a century of peace with all\r\nnations, found itself engaged in deadly conflict with a foreign enemy.\r\nEvery nerve was strained to meet the emergency. The response to the\r\ninitial call for 125,000 volunteers[20] was instant and complete, as was\r\nalso the result of the second call, of May 25, for 75,000 additional\r\nvolunteers.[21] The ranks of the Regular Army were increased to the\r\nlimits provided by the act of April 26, 1898.\r\n\r\nThe enlisted force of the Navy on the 15th day of August, when it\r\nreached its maximum, numbered 24,123 men and apprentices. One hundred\r\nand three vessels were added to the Navy by purchase, 1 was presented\r\nto the Government, 1 leased, and the 4 vessels of the International\r\nNavigation Company--the _St. Paul_, _St. Louis_, _New York_, and\r\n_Paris_--were chartered. In addition to these the revenue cutters\r\nand lighthouse tenders were turned over to the Navy Department and\r\nbecame temporarily a part of the auxiliary Navy.\r\n\r\nThe maximum effective fighting force of the Navy during the war,\r\nseparated into classes, was as follows:\r\n\r\nFour battle ships of the first class, 1 battle ship of the second\r\nclass, 2 armored cruisers, 6 coast-defense monitors, 1 armored ram,\r\n12 protected cruisers, 3 unprotected cruisers, 18 gunboats, 1 dynamite\r\ncruiser, 11 torpedo boats; vessels of the old Navy, including monitors,\r\n14. Auxiliary Navy: 11 auxiliary cruisers, 28 converted yachts, 27\r\nconverted tugs, 19 converted colliers, 15 revenue cutters, 4 light-house\r\ntenders, and 19 miscellaneous vessels.\r\n\r\nMuch alarm was felt along our entire Atlantic seaboard lest some attack\r\nmight be made by the enemy. Every precaution was taken to prevent\r\npossible injury to our great cities lying along the coast. Temporary\r\ngarrisons were provided, drawn from the State militia; infantry and\r\nlight batteries were drawn from the volunteer force. About 12,000 troops\r\nwere thus employed. The coast signal service was established for\r\nobserving the approach of an enemy's ships to the coast of the United\r\nStates, and the Life-Saving and Light-House services cooperated, which\r\nenabled the Navy Department to have all portions of the Atlantic coast,\r\nfrom Maine to Texas, under observation.\r\n\r\nThe auxiliary Navy was created under the authority of Congress and was\r\nofficered and manned by the Naval Militia of the several States. This\r\norganization patrolled the coast and performed the duty of a second line\r\nof defense.\r\n\r\nUnder the direction of the Chief of Engineers submarine mines were\r\nplaced at the most exposed points. Before the outbreak of the war\r\npermanent mining casemates and cable galleries had been constructed at\r\nnearly all important harbors. Most of the torpedo material was not to be\r\nfound in the market, and had to be specially manufactured. Under date\r\nof April 19 district officers were directed to take all preliminary\r\nmeasures short of the actual attaching of the loaded mines to the\r\ncables, and on April 22 telegraphic orders were issued to place the\r\nloaded mines in position.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate number of mines placed was 1,535, at the principal harbors\r\nfrom Maine to California. Preparations were also made for the planting\r\nof mines at certain other harbors, but owing to the early destruction of\r\nthe Spanish fleet these mines were not placed.\r\n\r\nThe Signal Corps was promptly organized, and performed service of the\r\nmost difficult and important character. Its operations during the war\r\ncovered the electrical connection of all coast fortifications, the\r\nestablishment of telephonic and telegraphic facilities for the camps at\r\nManila, Santiago, and in Puerto Rico. There were constructed 300 miles\r\nof line at ten great camps, thus facilitating military movements from\r\nthose points in a manner heretofore unknown in military administration.\r\nField telegraph lines were established and maintained under the enemy's\r\nfire at Manila, and later the Manila-Hongkong cable was reopened.\r\n\r\nIn Puerto Rico cable communications were opened over a discontinued\r\nroute, and on land the headquarters of the commanding officer was kept\r\nin telegraphic or telephonic communication with the division commanders\r\non four different lines of operations.\r\n\r\nThere was placed in Cuban waters a completely outfitted cable ship,\r\nwith war cables and cable gear, suitable both for the destruction of\r\ncommunications belonging to the enemy and the establishment of our own.\r\nTwo ocean cables were destroyed under the enemy's batteries at Santiago.\r\nThe day previous to the landing of General Shafter's corps, at\r\nCaimanera, within 20 miles of the landing place, cable communications\r\nwere established and a cable station opened giving direct communication\r\nwith the Government at Washington. This service was invaluable to the\r\nExecutive in directing the operations of the Army and Navy. With a total\r\nforce of over 1,300, the loss was by disease in camp and field, officers\r\nand men included, only 5.\r\n\r\nThe national-defense fund of $50,000,000 was expended in large part\r\nby the Army and Navy, and the objects for which it was used are fully\r\nshown in the reports of the several Secretaries. It was a most timely\r\nappropriation, enabling the Government to strengthen its defenses and\r\nmake preparations greatly needed in case of war.\r\n\r\nThis fund being inadequate to the requirements of equipment and for the\r\nconduct of the war, the patriotism of the Congress provided the means in\r\nthe war-revenue act of June 13 by authorizing a 3 per cent popular loan\r\nnot to exceed $400,000,000 and by levying additional imposts and taxes.\r\nOf the authorized loan $200,000,000 were offered and promptly taken, the\r\nsubscriptions so far exceeding the call as to cover it many times over,\r\nwhile, preference being given to the smaller bids, no single allotment\r\nexceeded $5,000. This was a most encouraging and significant result,\r\nshowing the vast resources of the nation and the determination of the\r\npeople to uphold their country's honor.\r\n\r\nIt is not within the province of this message to narrate the history of\r\nthe extraordinary war that followed the Spanish declaration of April 21,\r\nbut a brief recital of its more salient features is appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe first encounter of the war in point of date took place April 27,\r\nwhen a detachment of the blockading squadron made a reconnoissance in\r\nforce at Matanzas, shelled the harbor forts, and demolished several new\r\nworks in construction.\r\n\r\nThe next engagement was destined to mark a memorable epoch in maritime\r\nwarfare. The Pacific fleet, under Commodore George Dewey, had lain for\r\nsome weeks at Hongkong. Upon the colonial proclamation of neutrality\r\nbeing issued and the customary twenty-four hours' notice being given,\r\nit repaired to Mirs Bay, near Hongkong, whence it proceeded to the\r\nPhilippine Islands under telegraphed orders to capture or destroy the\r\nformidable Spanish fleet then assembled at Manila. At daybreak on the\r\n1st of May the American force entered Manila Bay, and after a few\r\nhours' engagement effected the total destruction of the Spanish fleet,\r\nconsisting of ten war ships and a transport, besides capturing the naval\r\nstation and forts at Cavite, thus annihilating the Spanish naval power\r\nin the Pacific Ocean and completely controlling the bay of Manila, with\r\nthe ability to take the city at will. Not a life was lost on our ships,\r\nthe wounded only numbering seven, while not a vessel was materially\r\ninjured. For this gallant achievement the Congress, upon my\r\nrecommendation, fitly bestowed upon the actors preferment and\r\nsubstantial reward.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this remarkable victory upon the spirit of our people and\r\nupon the fortunes of the war was instant. A prestige of invincibility\r\nthereby attached to our arms which continued throughout the struggle.\r\nReenforcements were hurried to Manila under the command of Major-General\r\nMerritt and firmly established within sight of the capital, which lay\r\nhelpless before our guns.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th day of May the Government was advised officially of the\r\nvictory at Manila, and at once inquired of the commander of our fleet\r\nwhat troops would be required. The information was received on the 15th\r\nday of May, and the first army expedition sailed May 25 and arrived off\r\nManila June 30. Other expeditions soon followed, the total force\r\nconsisting of 641 officers and 15,058 enlisted men.\r\n\r\nOnly reluctance to cause needless loss of life and property prevented\r\nthe early storming and capture of the city, and therewith the absolute\r\nmilitary occupancy of the whole group. The insurgents meanwhile had\r\nresumed the active hostilities suspended by the uncompleted truce of\r\nDecember, 1897. Their forces invested Manila from the northern and\r\neastern sides, but were constrained by Admiral Dewey and General Merritt\r\nfrom attempting an assault. It was fitting that whatever was to be done\r\nin the way of decisive operations in that quarter should be accomplished\r\nby the strong arm of the United States alone. Obeying the stern precept\r\nof war which enjoins the overcoming of the adversary and the extinction\r\nof his power wherever assailable as the speedy and sure means to win a\r\npeace, divided victory was not permissible, for no partition of the\r\nrights and responsibilities attending the enforcement of a just and\r\nadvantageous peace could be thought of.\r\n\r\nFollowing the comprehensive scheme of general attack, powerful forces\r\nwere assembled at various points on our coast to invade Cuba and Puerto\r\nRico. Meanwhile naval demonstrations were made at several exposed\r\npoints. On May 11 the cruiser _Wilmington_ and torpedo boat\r\n_Winslow_ were unsuccessful in an attempt to silence the batteries\r\nat Cardenas, a gallant ensign, Worth Bagley, and four seamen falling.\r\nThese grievous fatalities were, strangely enough, among the very few\r\nwhich occurred during our naval operations in this extraordinary\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Spanish naval preparations had been pushed with great\r\nvigor. A powerful squadron under Admiral Cervera, which had assembled at\r\nthe Cape Verde Islands before the outbreak of hostilities, had crossed\r\nthe ocean, and by its erratic movements in the Caribbean Sea delayed our\r\nmilitary plans while baffling the pursuit of our fleets. For a time\r\nfears were felt lest the _Oregon_ and _Marietta_, then nearing\r\nhome after their long voyage from San Francisco of over 15,000 miles,\r\nmight be surprised by Admiral Cervera's fleet, but their fortunate\r\narrival dispelled these apprehensions and lent much-needed\r\nreenforcement. Not until Admiral Cervera took refuge in the harbor of\r\nSantiago de Cuba, about May 19, was it practicable to plan a systematic\r\nnaval and military attack upon the Antillean possessions of Spain.\r\n\r\nSeveral demonstrations occurred on the coasts of Cuba and Puerto Rico in\r\npreparation for the larger event. On May 13 the North Atlantic Squadron\r\nshelled San Juan de Puerto Rico. On May 30 Commodore Schley's squadron\r\nbombarded the forts guarding the mouth of Santiago Harbor. Neither\r\nattack had any material result. It was evident that well-ordered land\r\noperations were indispensable to achieve a decisive advantage.\r\n\r\nThe next act in the war thrilled not alone the hearts of our countrymen\r\nbut the world by its exceptional heroism. On the night of June 3\r\nLieutenant Hobson, aided by seven devoted volunteers, blocked the narrow\r\noutlet from Santiago Harbor by sinking the collier _Merrimac_ in\r\nthe channel, under a fierce fire from the shore batteries, escaping with\r\ntheir lives as by a miracle, but falling into the hands of the\r\nSpaniards. It is a most gratifying incident of the war that the bravery\r\nof this little band of heroes was cordially appreciated by the Spanish\r\nadmiral, who sent a flag of truce to notify Admiral Sampson of their\r\nsafety and to compliment them on their daring act. They were\r\nsubsequently exchanged July 7.\r\n\r\nBy June 7 the cutting of the last Cuban cable isolated the island.\r\nThereafter the invasion was vigorously prosecuted. On June 10, under a\r\nheavy protecting fire, a landing of 600 marines from the _Oregon_,\r\n_Marblehead_, and _Yankee_ was effected in Guantanamo Bay, where it had\r\nbeen determined to establish a naval station.\r\n\r\nThis important and essential port was taken from the enemy, after severe\r\nfighting, by the marines, who were the first organized force of the\r\nUnited States to land in Cuba.\r\n\r\nThe position so won was held despite desperate attempts to dislodge\r\nour forces. By June 16 additional forces were landed and strongly\r\nintrenched. On June 22 the advance of the invading army under\r\nMajor-General Shafter landed at Daiquiri, about 15 miles east of\r\nSantiago. This was accomplished under great difficulties, but with\r\nmarvelous dispatch. On June 23 the movement against Santiago was begun.\r\nOn the 24th the first serious engagement took place, in which the First\r\nand Tenth Cavalry and the First United States Volunteer Cavalry, General\r\nYoung's brigade of General Wheeler's division, participated, losing\r\nheavily. By nightfall, however, ground within 5 miles of Santiago was\r\nwon. The advantage was steadily increased. On July 1 a severe battle\r\ntook place, our forces gaining the outworks of Santiago; on the 2d El\r\nCaney and San Juan were taken after a desperate charge, and the\r\ninvestment of the city was completed. The Navy cooperated by shelling\r\nthe town and the coast forts.\r\n\r\nOn the day following this brilliant achievement of our land forces, the\r\n3d of July, occurred the decisive naval combat of the war. The Spanish\r\nfleet, attempting to leave the harbor, was met by the American squadron\r\nunder command of Commodore Sampson. In less than three hours all the\r\nSpanish ships were destroyed, the two torpedo boats being sunk and the\r\n_Maria Teresa_, _Almirante Oquendo_, _Vizcaya_, and _Cristóbal Colón_\r\ndriven ashore. The Spanish admiral and over 1,300 men were taken\r\nprisoners. While the enemy's loss of life was deplorably large, some 600\r\nperishing, on our side but one man was killed, on the _Brooklyn_, and\r\none man seriously wounded. Although our ships were repeatedly struck,\r\nnot one was seriously injured. Where all so conspicuously distinguished\r\nthemselves, from the commanders to the gunners and the unnamed heroes in\r\nthe boiler rooms, each and all contributing toward the achievement of\r\nthis astounding victory, for which neither ancient nor modern history\r\naffords a parallel in the completeness of the event and the marvelous\r\ndisproportion of casualties, it would be invidious to single out any for\r\nespecial honor. Deserved promotion has rewarded the more conspicuous\r\nactors. The nation's profoundest gratitude is due to all of these brave\r\nmen who by their skill and devotion in a few short hours crushed the sea\r\npower of Spain and wrought a triumph whose decisiveness and far-reaching\r\nconsequences can scarcely be measured. Nor can we be unmindful of the\r\nachievements of our builders, mechanics, and artisans for their skill in\r\nthe construction of our war ships.\r\n\r\nWith the catastrophe of Santiago Spain's effort upon the ocean virtually\r\nceased. A spasmodic effort toward the end of June to send her\r\nMediterranean fleet, under Admiral Camara, to relieve Manila was\r\nabandoned, the expedition being recalled after it had passed through the\r\nSuez Canal.\r\n\r\nThe capitulation of Santiago followed. The city was closely besieged by\r\nland, while the entrance of our ships into the harbor cut off all relief\r\non that side. After a truce to allow of the removal of noncombatants\r\nprotracted negotiations continued from July 3 until July 15, when, under\r\nmenace of immediate assault, the preliminaries of surrender were agreed\r\nupon. On the 17th General Shafter occupied the city. The capitulation\r\nembraced the entire eastern end of Cuba. The number of Spanish soldiers\r\nsurrendering was 22,000, all of whom were subsequently conveyed to Spain\r\nat the charge of the United States. The story of this successful\r\ncampaign is told in the report of the Secretary of War, which will be\r\nlaid before you. The individual valor of officers and soldiers was never\r\nmore strikingly shown than in the several engagements leading to the\r\nsurrender of Santiago, while the prompt movements and successive\r\nvictories won instant and universal applause. To those who gained this\r\ncomplete triumph, which established the ascendency of the United States\r\nupon land as the fight off Santiago had fixed our supremacy on the seas,\r\nthe earnest and lasting gratitude of the nation is unsparingly due. Nor\r\nshould we alone remember the gallantry of the living; the dead claim our\r\ntears, and our losses by battle and disease must cloud any exultation at\r\nthe result and teach us to weigh the awful cost of war, however rightful\r\nthe cause or signal the victory.\r\n\r\nWith the fall of Santiago the occupation of Puerto Rico became the next\r\nstrategic necessity. General Miles had previously been assigned to\r\norganize an expedition for that purpose. Fortunately he was already at\r\nSantiago, where he had arrived on the 11th of July with reenforcements\r\nfor General Shafter's army.\r\n\r\nWith these troops, consisting of 3,415 infantry and artillery, two\r\ncompanies of engineers, and one company of the Signal Corps, General\r\nMiles left Guantanamo on July 21, having nine transports convoyed by the\r\nfleet under Captain Higginson with the _Massachusetts_ (flagship), _Dixie_,\r\n_Gloucester_, _Columbia_, and _Yale_, the two latter carrying troops.\r\nThe expedition landed at Guanica July 25, which port was entered with\r\nlittle opposition. Here the fleet was joined by the _Annapolis_ and\r\nthe _Wasp_, while the _Puritan_ and _Amphitrite_ went to San Juan and\r\njoined the _New Orleans_, which was engaged in blockading that port. The\r\nMajor-General Commanding was subsequently reenforced by General Schwan's\r\nbrigade of the Third Army Corps, by General Wilson with a part of his\r\ndivision, and also by General Brooke with a part of his corps, numbering\r\nin all 16,973 officers and men.\r\n\r\nOn July 27 he entered Ponce, one of the most important ports in the\r\nisland, from which he thereafter directed operations for the capture of\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of encounters with the enemy at Guayama,\r\nHormigueros, Coarno, and Yauco and an attack on a force landed at Cape\r\nSan Juan, there was no serious resistance. The campaign was prosecuted\r\nwith great vigor, and by the 12th of August much of the island was in\r\nour possession and the acquisition of the remainder was only a matter\r\nof a short time. At most of the points in the island our troops were\r\nenthusiastically welcomed. Protestations of loyalty to the flag and\r\ngratitude for delivery from Spanish rule met our commanders at every\r\nstage. As a potent influence toward peace the outcome of the Puerto\r\nRican expedition was of great consequence, and generous commendation\r\nis due to those who participated in it.\r\n\r\nThe last scene of the war was enacted at Manila, its starting place. On\r\nAugust 15, after a brief assault upon the works by the land forces, in\r\nwhich the squadron assisted, the capital surrendered unconditionally.\r\nThe casualties were comparatively few. By this the conquest of the\r\nPhilippine Islands, virtually accomplished when the Spanish capacity for\r\nresistance was destroyed by Admiral Dewey's victory of the 1st of May,\r\nwas formally sealed. To General Merritt, his officers and men, for their\r\nuncomplaining and devoted service and for their gallantry in action, the\r\nnation is sincerely grateful. Their long voyage was made with singular\r\nsuccess, and the soldierly conduct of the men, most of whom were without\r\nprevious experience in the military service, deserves unmeasured praise.\r\n\r\nThe total casualties in killed and wounded in the Army during the war\r\nwith Spain were: Officers killed, 23; enlisted men killed, 257; total,\r\n280; officers wounded, 113; enlisted men wounded, 1,464; total, 1,577.\r\nOf the Navy: Killed, 17; wounded, 67; died as result of wounds, 1;\r\ninvalided from service, 6; total, 91.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that while our Navy was engaged in two great battles\r\nand in numerous perilous undertakings in blockade and bombardment, and\r\nmore than 50,000 of our troops were transported to distant lands and\r\nwere engaged in assault and siege and battle and many skirmishes in\r\nunfamiliar territory, we lost in both arms of the service a total of\r\n1,668 killed and wounded; and in the entire campaign by land and sea we\r\ndid not lose a gun or a flag or a transport or a ship, and, with the\r\nexception of the crew of the _Merrimac_, not a soldier or sailor\r\nwas taken prisoner.\r\n\r\nOn August 7, forty-six days from the date of the landing of General\r\nShafter's army in Cuba and twenty-one days from the surrender of\r\nSantiago, the United States troops commenced embarkation for home, and\r\nour entire force was returned to the United States as early as August\r\n24. They were absent from the United States only two months.\r\n\r\nIt is fitting that I should bear testimony to the patriotism and\r\ndevotion of that large portion of our Army which, although eager to be\r\nordered to the post of greatest exposure, fortunately was not required\r\noutside of the United States. They did their whole duty, and, like their\r\ncomrades at the front, have earned the gratitude of the nation. In like\r\nmanner, the officers and men of the Army and of the Navy who remained\r\nin their departments and stations faithfully performing most important\r\nduties connected with the war, and whose requests for assignment in the\r\nfield and at sea I was compelled to refuse because their services were\r\nindispensable here, are entitled to the highest commendation. It is my\r\nregret that there seems to be no provision for their suitable\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is a pleasure for me to mention in terms of\r\ncordial appreciation the timely and useful work of the American National\r\nRed Cross, both in relief measures preparatory to the campaigns, in\r\nsanitary assistance at several of the camps of assemblage, and later,\r\nunder the able and experienced leadership of the president of the\r\nsociety, Miss Clara Barton, on the fields of battle and in the hospitals\r\nat the front in Cuba. Working in conjunction with the governmental\r\nauthorities and under their sanction and approval, and with the\r\nenthusiastic cooperation of many patriotic women and societies in the\r\nvarious States, the Red Cross has fully maintained its already high\r\nreputation for intense earnestness and ability to exercise the noble\r\npurposes of its international organization, thus justifying the\r\nconfidence and support which it has received at the hands of the\r\nAmerican people. To the members and officers of this society and all who\r\naided them in their philanthropic work the sincere and lasting gratitude\r\nof the soldiers and the public is due and is freely accorded.\r\n\r\nIn tracing these events we are constantly reminded of our obligations to\r\nthe Divine Master for His watchful care over us and His safe guidance,\r\nfor which the nation makes reverent acknowledgment and offers humble\r\nprayer for the continuance of His favor.\r\n\r\nThe annihilation of Admiral Cervera's fleet, followed by the\r\ncapitulation of Santiago, having brought to the Spanish Government\r\na realizing sense of the hopelessness of continuing a struggle now\r\nbecome wholly unequal, it made overtures of peace through the French\r\nambassador, who, with the assent of his Government, had acted as the\r\nfriendly representative of Spanish interests during the war. On the\r\n26th of July M. Cambon presented a communication signed by the Duke of\r\nAlmodóvar, the Spanish minister of state, inviting the United States to\r\nstate the terms upon which it would be willing to make peace. On the\r\n30th of July, by a communication addressed to the Duke of Almodóvar\r\nand handed to M. Cambon, the terms of this Government were announced\r\nsubstantially as in the protocol afterwards signed. On the 10th of\r\nAugust the Spanish reply, dated August 7, was handed by M. Cambon to the\r\nSecretary of State. It accepted unconditionally the terms imposed as to\r\nCuba, Puerto Rico, and an island of the Ladrones group, but appeared to\r\nseek to introduce inadmissible reservations in regard to our demand as\r\nto the Philippine Islands. Conceiving that discussion on this point\r\ncould neither be practical nor profitable, I directed that in order\r\nto avoid misunderstanding the matter should be forthwith closed by\r\nproposing the embodiment in a formal protocol of the terms upon which\r\nthe negotiations for peace were to be undertaken. The vague and\r\ninexplicit suggestions of the Spanish note could not be accepted, the\r\nonly reply being to present as a virtual ultimatum a draft of protocol\r\nembodying the precise terms tendered to Spain in our note of July 30,\r\nwith added stipulations of detail as to the appointment of commissioners\r\nto arrange for the evacuation of the Spanish Antilles. On August 12\r\nM. Cambon announced his receipt of full powers to sign the protocol\r\nso submitted. Accordingly, on the afternoon of August 12, M. Cambon,\r\nas the plenipotentiary of Spain, and the Secretary of State, as the\r\nplenipotentiary of the United States, signed a protocol providing--\r\n\r\n  ARTICLE I. Spain will relinquish all claim of sovereignty over and title\r\n  to Cuba.\r\n\r\n  ART. II. Spain will cede to the United States the island of Puerto Rico\r\n  and other islands now under Spanish sovereignty in the West Indies, and\r\n  also an island in the Ladrones to be selected by the United States.\r\n\r\n  ART. III. The United States will occupy and hold the city, bay, and\r\n  harbor of Manila pending the conclusion of a treaty of peace which shall\r\n  determine the control, disposition, and government of the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fourth article provided for the appointment of joint commissions on\r\nthe part of the United States and Spain, to meet in Havana and San Juan,\r\nrespectively, for the purpose of arranging and carrying out the details\r\nof the stipulated evacuation of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and other Spanish\r\nislands in the West Indies.\r\n\r\nThe fifth article provided for the appointment of not more than five\r\ncommissioners on each side, to meet at Paris not later than October 1\r\nand to proceed to the negotiation and conclusion of a treaty of peace,\r\nsubject to ratification according to the respective constitutional forms\r\nof the two countries.\r\n\r\nThe sixth and last article provided that upon the signature of the\r\nprotocol hostilities between the two countries should be suspended and\r\nthat notice to that effect should be given as soon as possible by each\r\nGovernment to the commanders of its military and naval forces.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the conclusion of the protocol I issued a proclamation,\r\nof August 12,[22] suspending hostilities on the part of the United\r\nStates. The necessary orders to that end were at once given by\r\ntelegraph. The blockade of the ports of Cuba and San Juan de Puerto Rico\r\nwas in like manner raised. On the 18th of August the muster out of\r\n100,000 volunteers, or as near that number as was found to be\r\npracticable, was ordered.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of December 101,165 officers and men had been mustered out\r\nand discharged from the service, and 9,002 more will be mustered out\r\nby the 10th of this month; also a corresponding number of general and\r\ngeneral staff officers have been honorably discharged the service.\r\n\r\nThe military commissions to superintend the evacuation of Cuba, Puerto\r\nRico, and the adjacent islands were forthwith appointed--for Cuba,\r\nMajor-General James F. Wade, Rear-Admiral William T. Sampson,\r\nMajor-General Matthew C. Butler; for Puerto Rico, Major-General John R.\r\nBrooke, Rear-Admiral Winfield S. Schley, Brigadier-General William W.\r\nGordon--who soon afterwards met the Spanish commissioners at Havana and\r\nSan Juan, respectively. The Puerto Rican Joint Commission speedily\r\naccomplished its task, and by the 18th of October the evacuation of the\r\nisland was completed. The United States flag was raised over the island\r\nat noon on that day. The administration of its affairs has been\r\nprovisionally intrusted to a military governor until the Congress shall\r\notherwise provide. The Cuban Joint Commission has not yet terminated its\r\nlabors. Owing to the difficulties in the way of removing the large\r\nnumbers of Spanish troops still in Cuba, the evacuation can not be\r\ncompleted before the 1st of January next.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the fifth article of the protocol, I appointed William R.\r\nDay, lately Secretary of State; Cushman K. Davis, William P. Frye, and\r\nGeorge Gray, Senators of the United States, and Whitelaw Reid to be the\r\npeace commissioners on the part of the United States. Proceeding in due\r\nseason to Paris, they there met on the 1st of October five commissioners\r\nsimilarly appointed on the part of Spain. Their negotiations have made\r\nhopeful progress, so that I trust soon to be able to lay a definitive\r\ntreaty of peace before the Senate, with a review of the steps leading\r\nto its signature.\r\n\r\nI do not discuss at this time the government or the future of the new\r\npossessions which will come to us as the result of the war with Spain.\r\nSuch discussion will be appropriate after the treaty of peace shall\r\nbe ratified. In the meantime and until the Congress has legislated\r\notherwise it will be my duty to continue the military governments which\r\nhave existed since our occupation and give to the people security in\r\nlife and property and encouragement under a just and beneficent rule.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we are in possession of Cuba and have pacified the island\r\nit will be necessary to give aid and direction to its people to form\r\na government for themselves. This should be undertaken at the earliest\r\nmoment consistent with safety and assured success. It is important that\r\nour relations with this people shall be of the most friendly character\r\nand our commercial relations close and reciprocal. It should be our\r\nduty to assist in every proper way to build up the waste places of the\r\nisland, encourage the industry of the people, and assist them to form a\r\ngovernment which shall be free and independent, thus realizing the best\r\naspirations of the Cuban people.\r\n\r\nSpanish rule must be replaced by a just, benevolent, and humane\r\ngovernment, created by the people of Cuba, capable of performing all\r\ninternational obligations, and which shall encourage thrift, industry,\r\nand prosperity and promote peace and good will among all of the\r\ninhabitants, whatever may have been their relations in the past. Neither\r\nrevenge nor passion should have a place in the new government. Until\r\nthere is complete tranquillity in the island and a stable government\r\ninaugurated military occupation will be continued.\r\n\r\nWith the one exception of the rupture with Spain, the intercourse of\r\nthe United States with the great family of nations has been marked with\r\ncordiality, and the close of the eventful year finds most of the issues\r\nthat necessarily arise in the complex relations of sovereign states\r\nadjusted or presenting no serious obstacle to a just and honorable\r\nsolution by amicable agreement.\r\n\r\nA long unsettled dispute as to the extended boundary between the\r\nArgentine Republic and Chile, stretching along the Andean crests from\r\nthe southern border of the Atacama Desert to Magellan Straits, nearly a\r\nthird of the length of the South American continent, assumed an acute\r\nstage in the early part of the year, and afforded to this Government\r\noccasion to express the hope that the resort to arbitration, already\r\ncontemplated by existing conventions between the parties, might prevail\r\ndespite the grave difficulties arising in its application. I am happy to\r\nsay that arrangements to this end have been perfected, the questions of\r\nfact upon which the respective commissioners were unable to agree being\r\nin course of reference to Her Britannic Majesty for determination.\r\nA residual difference touching the northern boundary line across the\r\nAtacama Desert, for which existing treaties provided no adequate\r\nadjustment, bids fair to be settled in like manner by a joint\r\ncommission, upon which the United States minister at Buenos Ayres has\r\nbeen invited to serve as umpire in the last resort.\r\n\r\nI have found occasion to approach the Argentine Government with a view\r\nto removing differences of rate charges imposed upon the cables of an\r\nAmerican corporation in the transmission between Buenos Ayres and the\r\ncities of Uruguay and Brazil of through messages passing from and\r\nto the United States. Although the matter is complicated by exclusive\r\nconcessions by Uruguay and Brazil to foreign companies, there is strong\r\nhope that a good understanding will be reached and that the important\r\nchannels of commercial communication between the United States and the\r\nAtlantic cities of South America may be freed from an almost prohibitory\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n\r\nIn this relation I may be permitted to express my sense of the fitness\r\nof an international agreement whereby the interchange of messages over\r\nconnecting cables may be regulated on a fair basis of uniformity.\r\nThe world has seen the postal system developed from a congeries of\r\nindependent and exclusive services into a well-ordered union, of which\r\nall countries enjoy the manifold benefits. It would be strange were the\r\nnations not in time brought to realize that modern civilization, which\r\nowes so much of its progress to the annihilation of space by the\r\nelectric force, demands that this all-important means of communication\r\nbe a heritage of all peoples, to be administered and regulated in their\r\ncommon behoof. A step in this direction was taken when the international\r\nconvention of 1884 for the protection of submarine cables was signed,\r\nand the day is, I trust, not far distant when this medium for the\r\ntransmission of thought from land to land may be brought within the\r\ndomain of international concert as completely as is the material\r\ncarriage of commerce and correspondence upon the face of the waters\r\nthat divide them.\r\n\r\nThe claim of Thomas Jefferson Page against Argentina, which has been\r\npending many years, has been adjusted. The sum awarded by the Congress\r\nof Argentina was $4,242.35.\r\n\r\nThe sympathy of the American people has justly been offered to the ruler\r\nand the people of Austria-Hungary by reason of the affliction that has\r\nlately befallen them in the assassination of the Empress-Queen of that\r\nhistoric realm.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of September, 1897, a conflict took place at Lattimer, Pa.,\r\nbetween a body of striking miners and the sheriff of Luzerne County and\r\nhis deputies, in which 22 miners were killed and 44 wounded, of whom\r\n10 of the killed and 12 of the wounded were Austrian and Hungarian\r\nsubjects. This deplorable event naturally aroused the solicitude of the\r\nAustro-Hungarian Government, which, on the assumption that the killing\r\nand wounding involved the unjustifiable misuse of authority, claimed\r\nreparation for the sufferers. Apart from the searching investigation and\r\nperemptory action of the authorities of Pennsylvania, the Federal\r\nExecutive took appropriate steps to learn the merits of the case, in\r\norder to be in a position to meet the urgent complaint of a friendly\r\npower. The sheriff and his deputies, having been indicted for murder,\r\nwere tried, and acquitted, after protracted proceedings and the hearing\r\nof hundreds of witnesses, on the ground that the killing was in the line\r\nof their official duty to uphold law and preserve public order in the\r\nState. A representative of the Department of Justice attended the trial\r\nand reported its course fully. With all the facts in its possession,\r\nthis Government expects to reach a harmonious understanding on the\r\nsubject with that of Austria-Hungary, notwithstanding the renewed claim\r\nof the latter, after learning the result of the trial, for indemnity for\r\nits injured subjects.\r\n\r\nDespite the brief time allotted for preparation, the exhibits of this\r\ncountry at the Universal Exposition at Brussels in 1897 enjoyed the\r\nsingular distinction of a larger proportion of awards, having regard\r\nto the number and classes of articles entered than those of other\r\ncountries. The worth of such a result in making known our national\r\ncapacity to supply the world's markets is obvious.\r\n\r\nExhibitions of this international character are becoming more frequent\r\nas the exchanges of commercial countries grow more intimate and varied.\r\nHardly a year passes that this Government is not invited to national\r\nparticipation at some important foreign center, but often on too short\r\nnotice to permit of recourse to Congress for the power and means to do\r\nso. My predecessors have suggested the advisability of providing by\r\na general enactment and a standing appropriation for accepting such\r\ninvitations and for representation of this country by a commission.\r\nThis plan has my cordial approval.\r\n\r\nI trust that the Belgian restrictions on the importation of cattle from\r\nthe United States, originally adopted as a sanitary precaution, will at\r\nan early day be relaxed as to their present features of hardship and\r\ndiscrimination, so as to admit live cattle under due regulation of their\r\nslaughter after landing. I am hopeful, too, of favorable change in\r\nthe Belgian treatment of our preserved and salted meats. The growth\r\nof direct trade between the two countries, not alone for Belgian\r\nconsumption and Belgian products, but by way of transit from and to\r\nother continental states, has been both encouraging and beneficial. No\r\neffort will be spared to enlarge its advantages by seeking the removal\r\nof needless impediments and by arrangements for increased commercial\r\nexchanges.\r\n\r\nThe year's events in Central America deserve more than passing mention.\r\n\r\nA menacing rupture between Costa Rica and Nicaragua was happily composed\r\nby the signature of a convention between the parties, with the\r\nconcurrence of the Guatemalan representative as a mediator, the act\r\nbeing negotiated and signed on board the United States steamer\r\n_Alert_, then lying in Central American waters. It is believed that\r\nthe good offices of our envoy and of the commander of that vessel\r\ncontributed toward this gratifying outcome.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message the situation was presented with respect to\r\nthe diplomatic representation of this Government in Central America\r\ncreated by the association of Nicaragua, Honduras, and Salvador under\r\nthe title of the Greater Republic of Central America, and the delegation\r\nof their international functions to the Diet thereof. While the\r\nrepresentative character of the Diet was recognized by my predecessor\r\nand has been confirmed during my Administration by receiving its\r\naccredited envoy and granting exequaturs to consuls commissioned under\r\nits authority, that recognition was qualified by the distinct\r\nunderstanding that the responsibility of each of the component sovereign\r\nRepublics toward the United States remained wholly unaffected.\r\n\r\nThis proviso was needful inasmuch as the compact of the three\r\nRepublics was at the outset an association whereby certain\r\nrepresentative functions were delegated to a tripartite commission\r\nrather than a federation possessing centralized powers of government\r\nand administration. In this view of their relation and of the\r\nrelation of the United States to the several Republics, a change\r\nin the representation of this country in Central America was neither\r\nrecommended by the Executive nor initiated by Congress, thus leaving one\r\nof our envoys accredited, as heretofore, separately to two States of the\r\nGreater Republic, Nicaragua and Salvador, and to a third State, Costa\r\nRica, which was not a party to the compact, while our other envoy was\r\nsimilarly accredited to a union State, Honduras, and a nonunion State,\r\nGuatemala. The result has been that the one has presented credentials\r\nonly to the President of Costa Rica, the other having been received only\r\nby the Government of Guatemala.\r\n\r\nSubsequently the three associated Republics entered into negotiations\r\nfor taking the steps forecast in the original compact. A convention of\r\ntheir delegates framed for them a federal constitution under the name of\r\nthe United States of Central America, and provided for a central federal\r\ngovernment and legislature. Upon ratification by the constituent States,\r\nthe 1st of November last was fixed for the new system to go into\r\noperation. Within a few weeks thereafter the plan was severely tested\r\nby revolutionary movements arising, with a consequent demand for unity\r\nof action on the part of the military power of the federal States to\r\nsuppress them. Under this strain the new union seems to have been\r\nweakened through the withdrawal of its more important members. This\r\nGovernment was not officially advised of the installation of the\r\nfederation and has maintained an attitude of friendly expectancy, while\r\nin no wise relinquishing the position held from the outset that the\r\nresponsibilities of the several States toward us remained unaltered by\r\ntheir tentative relations among themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Nicaragua Canal Commission, under the chairmanship of Rear-Admiral\r\nJohn G. Walker, appointed July 24, 1897, under the authority of a\r\nprovision in the sundry civil act of June 4 of that year, has nearly\r\ncompleted its labors, and the results of its exhaustive inquiry into the\r\nproper route, the feasibility, and the cost of construction of an\r\ninteroceanic canal by a Nicaraguan route will be laid before you. In the\r\nperformance of its task the commission received all possible courtesy\r\nand assistance from the Governments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, which\r\nthus testified their appreciation of the importance of giving a speedy\r\nand practical outcome to the great project that has for so many years\r\nengrossed the attention of the respective countries.\r\n\r\nAs the scope of the recent inquiry embraced the whole subject, with the\r\naim of making plans and surveys for a canal by the most convenient\r\nroute, it necessarily included a review of the results of previous\r\nsurveys and plans, and in particular those adopted by the Maritime Canal\r\nCompany under its existing concessions from Nicaragua and Costa Rica, so\r\nthat to this extent those grants necessarily hold as essential a part\r\nin the deliberations and conclusions of the Canal Commission as they\r\nhave held and must needs hold in the discussion of the matter by the\r\nCongress. Under these circumstances and in view of overtures made to the\r\nGovernments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica by other parties for a new canal\r\nconcession predicated on the assumed approaching lapse of the contracts\r\nof the Maritime Canal Company with those States, I have not hesitated\r\nto express my conviction that considerations of expediency and\r\ninternational policy as between the several governments interested in\r\nthe construction and control of an interoceanic canal by this route\r\nrequire the maintenance of the _status quo_ until the Canal\r\nCommission shall have reported and the United States Congress shall have\r\nhad the opportunity to pass finally upon the whole matter during the\r\npresent session, without prejudice by reason of any change in the\r\nexisting conditions.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it appears that the Government of Nicaragua, as one\r\nof its last sovereign acts before merging its powers in those of the\r\nnewly formed United States of Central America, has granted an optional\r\nconcession to another association, to become effective on the expiration\r\nof the present grant. It does not appear what surveys have been made\r\nor what route is proposed under this contingent grant, so that an\r\nexamination of the feasibility of its plans is necessarily not embraced\r\nin the report of the Canal Commission. All these circumstances suggest\r\nthe urgency of some definite action by the Congress at this session\r\nif the labors of the past are to be utilized and the linking of the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific oceans by a practical waterway is to be realized.\r\nThat the construction of such a maritime highway is now more than ever\r\nindispensable to that intimate and ready intercommunication between our\r\neastern and western seaboards demanded by the annexation of the Hawaiian\r\nIslands and the prospective expansion of our influence and commerce in\r\nthe Pacific, and that our national policy now more imperatively than\r\never calls for its control by this Government, are propositions which\r\nI doubt not the Congress will duly appreciate and wisely act upon.\r\n\r\nA convention providing for the revival of the late United States and\r\nChilean Claims Commission and the consideration of claims which were\r\nduly presented to the late commission, but not considered because of the\r\nexpiration of the time limited for the duration of the commission, was\r\nsigned May 24, 1897, and has remained unacted upon by the Senate. The\r\nterm therein fixed for effecting the exchange of ratifications having\r\nelapsed, the convention falls unless the time be extended by amendment,\r\nwhich I am endeavoring to bring about, with the friendly concurrence of\r\nthe Chilean Government.\r\n\r\nThe United States has not been an indifferent spectator of the\r\nextraordinary events transpiring in the Chinese Empire, whereby portions\r\nof its maritime provinces are passing under the control of various\r\nEuropean powers; but the prospect that the vast commerce which the\r\nenergy of our citizens and the necessity of our staple productions for\r\nChinese uses has built up in those regions may not be prejudiced through\r\nany exclusive treatment by the new occupants has obviated the need of\r\nour country becoming an actor in the scene. Our position among nations,\r\nhaving a large Pacific coast and a constantly expanding direct trade\r\nwith the farther Orient, gives us the equitable claim to consideration\r\nand friendly treatment in this regard, and it will be my aim to subserve\r\nour large interests in that quarter by all means appropriate to the\r\nconstant policy of our Government. The territories of Kiao-chow, of\r\nWei-hai-wei, and of Port Arthur and Talienwan, leased to Germany,\r\nGreat Britain, and Russia, respectively, for terms of years, will,\r\nit is announced, be open to international commerce during such alien\r\noccupation; and if no discriminating treatment of American citizens and\r\ntheir trade be found to exist or be hereafter developed, the desire of\r\nthis Government would appear to be realized.\r\n\r\nIn this relation, as showing the volume and value of our exchanges with\r\nChina and the peculiarly favorable conditions which exist for their\r\nexpansion in the normal course of trade, I refer to the communication\r\naddressed to the Speaker of the House of Representatives by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury on the 14th of last June, with its\r\naccompanying letter of the Secretary of State, recommending an\r\nappropriation for a commission to study the commercial and industrial\r\nconditions in the Chinese Empire and report as to the opportunities\r\nfor and obstacles to the enlargement of markets in China for the\r\nraw products and manufactures of the United States. Action was not\r\ntaken thereon during the late session. I cordially urge that the\r\nrecommendation receive at your hands the consideration which its\r\nimportance and timeliness merit.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there may be just ground for disquietude in view of the unrest\r\nand revival of the old sentiment of opposition and prejudice to alien\r\npeople which pervades certain of the Chinese provinces. As in the case\r\nof the attacks upon our citizens in Szechuen and at Kutien in 1895, the\r\nUnited States minister has been instructed to secure the fullest measure\r\nof protection, both local and imperial, for any menaced American\r\ninterests, and to demand, in case of lawless injury to person or\r\nproperty, instant reparation appropriate to the case. War ships have\r\nbeen stationed at Tientsin for more ready observation of the disorders\r\nwhich have invaded even the Chinese capital, so as to be in a position\r\nto act should need arise, while a guard of marines has been sent to\r\nPeking to afford the minister the same measure of authoritative\r\nprotection as the representatives of other nations have been constrained\r\nto employ.\r\n\r\nFollowing close upon the rendition of the award of my predecessor as\r\narbitrator of the claim of the Italian subject Cerruti against the\r\nRepublic of Colombia, differences arose between the parties to the\r\narbitration in regard to the scope and extension of the award, of which\r\ncertain articles were contested by Colombia, while Italy claimed their\r\nliteral fulfillment. The award having been made by the President of the\r\nUnited States, as an act of friendly consideration and with the sole\r\nview to an impartial composition of the matter in dispute, I could\r\nnot but feel deep concern at such a miscarriage, and while unable to\r\naccept the Colombian theory that I, in my official capacity, possessed\r\ncontinuing functions as arbitrator, with power to interpret or revise\r\nthe terms of the award, my best efforts were lent to bring the parties\r\nto a harmonious agreement as to the execution of its provisions.\r\n\r\nA naval demonstration by Italy resulted in an engagement to pay\r\nthe liabilities claimed upon their ascertainment; but this apparent\r\ndisposition of the controversy was followed by a rupture of diplomatic\r\nintercourse between Colombia and Italy, which still continues, although,\r\nfortunately, without acute symptoms having supervened. Notwithstanding\r\nthis, efforts are reported to be continuing for the ascertainment of\r\nColombia's contingent liability on account of Cerruti's debts under the\r\nfifth article of the award.\r\n\r\nA claim of an American citizen against the Dominican Republic for\r\na public bridge over the Ozama River, which has been in diplomatic\r\ncontroversy for several years, has been settled by expert arbitration\r\nand an award in favor of the claimant amounting to about $90,000. It,\r\nhowever, remains unpaid, despite urgent demands for its settlement\r\naccording to the terms of the compact.\r\n\r\nThere is now every prospect that the participation of the United States\r\nin the Universal Exposition to be held in Paris in 1900 will be on a\r\nscale commensurate with the advanced position held by our products and\r\nindustries in the world's chief marts.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary report of Mr. Moses P. Handy, who, under the act\r\napproved July 19, 1897, was appointed special commissioner with a view\r\nto securing all attainable information necessary to a full and complete\r\nunderstanding by Congress in regard to the participation of this\r\nGovernment in the Paris Exposition, was laid before you by my message\r\nof December 6, 1897, and showed the large opportunities opened to make\r\nknown our national progress in arts, science, and manufactures, as\r\nwell as the urgent need of immediate and adequate provision to enable\r\ndue advantage thereof to be taken. Mr. Handy's death soon afterwards\r\nrendered it necessary for another to take up and complete his unfinished\r\nwork, and on January 11 last Mr. Thomas W. Cridler, Third Assistant\r\nSecretary of State, was designated to fulfill that task. His report was\r\nlaid before you by my message of June 14, 1898, with the gratifying\r\nresult of awakening renewed interest in the projected display. By a\r\nprovision in the sundry civil appropriation act of July 1, 1898, a sum\r\nnot to exceed $650,000 was allotted for the organization of a commission\r\nto care for the proper preparation and installation of American exhibits\r\nand for the display of suitable exhibits by the several Executive\r\nDepartments, particularly by the Department of Agriculture, the Fish\r\nCommission, and the Smithsonian Institution, in representation of the\r\nGovernment of the United States.\r\n\r\nPursuant to that enactment I appointed Mr. Ferdinand W. Peck, of\r\nChicago, commissioner-general, with an assistant commissioner-general\r\nand a secretary. Mr. Peck at once proceeded to Paris, where his success\r\nin enlarging the scope and variety of the United States exhibit has\r\nbeen most gratifying. Notwithstanding the comparatively limited area\r\nof the exposition site--less than one-half that of the World's Fair at\r\nChicago--the space assigned to the United States has been increased from\r\nthe absolute allotment of 157,403 square feet reported by Mr. Handy to\r\nsome 202,000 square feet, with corresponding augmentation of the field\r\nfor a truly characteristic representation of the various important\r\nbranches of our country's development. Mr. Peck's report will be laid\r\nbefore you. In my judgment its recommendations will call for your early\r\nconsideration, especially as regards an increase of the appropriation to\r\nat least one million dollars in all, so that not only may the assigned\r\nspace be fully taken up by the best possible exhibits in every class,\r\nbut the preparation and installation be on so perfect a scale as to\r\nrank among the first in that unparalleled competition of artistic and\r\ninventive production, and thus counterbalance the disadvantage with\r\nwhich we start as compared with other countries whose appropriations are\r\non a more generous scale and whose preparations are in a state of much\r\ngreater forwardness than our own.\r\n\r\nWhere our artisans have the admitted capacity to excel, where our\r\ninventive genius has initiated many of the grandest discoveries of these\r\nlater days of the century, and where the native resources of our land\r\nare as limitless as they are valuable to supply the world's needs, it is\r\nour province, as it should be our earnest care, to lead in the march of\r\nhuman progress, and not rest content with any secondary place. Moreover,\r\nif this be due to ourselves, it is no less due to the great French\r\nnation whose guests we become, and which has in so many ways testified\r\nits wish and hope that our participation shall befit the place the two\r\npeoples have won in the field of universal development.\r\n\r\nThe commercial arrangement made with France on the 28th of May, 1898,\r\nunder the provisions of section 3 of the tariff act of 1897, went into\r\neffect on the 1st day of June following. It has relieved a portion of\r\nour export trade from serious embarrassment. Further negotiations\r\nare now pending under section 4 of the same act with a view to the\r\nincrease of trade between the two countries to their mutual advantage.\r\nNegotiations with other governments, in part interrupted by the war with\r\nSpain, are in progress under both sections of the tariff act. I hope to\r\nbe able to announce some of the results of these negotiations during the\r\npresent session of Congress.\r\n\r\nNegotiations to the same end with Germany have been set on foot.\r\nMeanwhile no effort has been relaxed to convince the Imperial Government\r\nof the thoroughness of our inspection of pork products for exportation,\r\nand it is trusted that the efficient administration of this measure by\r\nthe Department of Agriculture will be recognized as a guaranty of the\r\nhealthfulness of the food staples we send abroad to countries where\r\ntheir use is large and necessary.\r\n\r\nI transmitted to the Senate on the 10th of February last information\r\ntouching the prohibition against the importation of fresh fruits from\r\nthis country, which had then recently been decreed by Germany on the\r\nground of danger of disseminating the San José scale insect. This\r\nprecautionary measure was justified by Germany on the score of the\r\ndrastic steps taken in several States of the Union against the spread of\r\nthe pest, the elaborate reports of the Department of Agriculture being\r\nput in evidence to show the danger to German fruit-growing interests\r\nshould the scale obtain a lodgment in that country. Temporary relief was\r\nafforded in the case of large consignments of fruit then on the way by\r\ninspection and admission when found noninfected. Later the prohibition\r\nwas extended to dried fruits of every kind, but was relaxed so as to\r\napply only to unpeeled fruit and fruit waste. As was to be expected, the\r\nalarm reached to other countries, and Switzerland has adopted a similar\r\ninhibition. Efforts are in progress to induce the German and Swiss\r\nGovernments to relax the prohibition in favor of dried fruits shown to\r\nhave been cured under circumstances rendering the existence of animal\r\nlife impossible.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Great Britain have continued on the most friendly\r\nfooting. Assenting to our request, the protection of Americans and their\r\ninterests in Spanish jurisdiction was assumed by the diplomatic and\r\nconsular representatives of Great Britain, who fulfilled their delicate\r\nand arduous trust with tact and zeal, eliciting high commendation.\r\nI may be allowed to make fitting allusion to the instance of Mr. Ramsden,\r\nHer Majesty's consul at Santiago de Cuba, whose untimely death after\r\ndistinguished service and untiring effort during the siege of that city\r\nwas sincerely lamented.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of April last, pursuant to a request made at the\r\ninstance of the Secretary of State by the British ambassador at this\r\ncapital, the Canadian government granted facilities for the passage of\r\nfour United States revenue cutters from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic\r\ncoast by way of the Canadian canals and the St. Lawrence River. The\r\nvessels had reached Lake Ontario and were there awaiting the opening of\r\nnavigation when war was declared between the United States and Spain.\r\nHer Majesty's Government thereupon, by a communication of the latter\r\npart of April, stated that the permission granted before the outbreak of\r\nhostilities would not be withdrawn provided the United States Government\r\ngave assurance that the vessels in question would proceed direct to\r\na United States port without engaging in any hostile operation.\r\nThis Government promptly agreed to the stipulated condition, it being\r\nunderstood that the vessels would not be prohibited from resisting any\r\nhostile attack.\r\n\r\nIt will give me especial satisfaction if I shall be authorized to\r\ncommunicate to you a favorable conclusion of the pending negotiations\r\nwith Great Britain in respect to the Dominion of Canada. It is the\r\nearnest wish of this Government to remove all sources of discord and\r\nirritation in our relations with the neighboring Dominion. The trade\r\nbetween the two countries is constantly increasing, and it is important\r\nto both countries that all reasonable facilities should be granted for\r\nits development.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Greece strongly urges the onerousness of the duty here\r\nimposed upon the currants of that country, amounting to 100 per cent or\r\nmore of their market value. This fruit is stated to be exclusively a\r\nGreek product, not coming into competition with any domestic product.\r\nThe question of reciprocal commercial relations with Greece, including\r\nthe restoration of currants to the free list, is under consideration.\r\n\r\nThe long-standing claim of Bernard Campbell for damages for injuries\r\nsustained from a violent assault committed against him by military\r\nauthorities in the island of Haiti has been settled by the agreement of\r\nthat Republic to pay him $10,000 in American gold. Of this sum $5,000\r\nhas already been paid. It is hoped that other pending claims of American\r\ncitizens against that Republic may be amicably adjusted.\r\n\r\nPending the consideration by the Senate of the treaty signed June 16,\r\n1897, by the plenipotentiaries of the United States and of the Republic\r\nof Hawaii, providing for the annexation of the islands, a joint\r\nresolution to accomplish the same purpose by accepting the offered\r\ncession and incorporating the ceded territory into the Union was adopted\r\nby the Congress and approved July 7, 1898. I thereupon directed the\r\nUnited States steamship _Philadelphia_ to convey Rear-Admiral\r\nMiller to Honolulu, and intrusted to his hands this important\r\nlegislative act, to be delivered to the President of the Republic of\r\nHawaii, with whom the Admiral and the United States minister were\r\nauthorized to make appropriate arrangements for transferring the\r\nsovereignty of the islands to the United States. This was simply but\r\nimpressively accomplished on the 12th of August last by the delivery of\r\na certified copy of the resolution to President Dole, who thereupon\r\nyielded up to the representative of the Government of the United States\r\nthe sovereignty and public property of the Hawaiian Islands.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the terms of the joint resolution and in exercise of\r\nthe authority thereby conferred upon me, I directed that the civil,\r\njudicial, and military powers theretofore exercised by the officers of\r\nthe Government of the Republic of Hawaii should continue to be exercised\r\nby those officers until Congress shall provide a government for the\r\nincorporated territory, subject to my power to remove such officers and\r\nto fill vacancies. The President, officers, and troops of the Republic\r\nthereupon took the oath of allegiance to the United States, thus\r\nproviding for the uninterrupted continuance of all the administrative\r\nand municipal functions of the annexed territory until Congress shall\r\notherwise enact.\r\n\r\nFollowing the further provision of the joint resolution, I appointed the\r\nHons. Shelby M. Cullom, of Illinois, John T. Morgan, of Alabama, Robert\r\nR. Hitt, of Illinois, Sanford B. Dole, of Hawaii, and Walter F. Frear,\r\nof Hawaii, as commissioners to confer and recommend to Congress such\r\nlegislation concerning the Hawaiian Islands as they should deem\r\nnecessary or proper. The commissioners having fulfilled the mission\r\nconfided to them, their report will be laid before you at an early day.\r\nIt is believed that their recommendations will have the earnest\r\nconsideration due to the magnitude of the responsibility resting upon\r\nyou to give such shape to the relationship of those mid-Pacific lands to\r\nour home Union as will benefit both in the highest degree, realizing the\r\naspirations of the community that has cast its lot with us and elected\r\nto share our political heritage, while at the same time justifying the\r\nforesight of those who for three-quarters of a century have looked to\r\nthe assimilation of Hawaii as a natural and inevitable consummation, in\r\nharmony with our needs and in fulfillment of our cherished traditions.\r\n\r\nThe questions heretofore pending between Hawaii and Japan growing out\r\nof the alleged mistreatment of Japanese treaty immigrants were, I am\r\npleased to say, adjusted before the act of transfer by the payment of\r\na reasonable indemnity to the Government of Japan.\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the joint resolution, the existing customs\r\nrelations of the Hawaiian Islands with the United States and with other\r\ncountries remain unchanged until legislation shall otherwise provide.\r\nThe consuls of Hawaii here and in foreign countries continue to fulfill\r\ntheir commercial agencies, while the United States consulate at Honolulu\r\nis maintained for all appropriate services pertaining to trade and the\r\nrevenue. It would be desirable that all foreign consuls in the Hawaiian\r\nIslands should receive new exequaturs from this Government.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is called to the fact that, our consular\r\noffices having ceased to exist in Hawaii and being about to cease in\r\nother countries coming under the sovereignty of the United States, the\r\nprovisions for the relief and transportation of destitute American\r\nseamen in these countries under our consular regulations will in\r\nconsequence terminate. It is proper, therefore, that new legislation\r\nshould be enacted upon this subject in order to meet the changed\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of certain provisions of the extradition convention\r\nof December 11, 1861, has been at various times the occasion of\r\ncontroversy with the Government of Mexico. An acute difference arose in\r\nthe case of the Mexican demand for the delivery of Jesús Guerra, who,\r\nhaving led a marauding expedition near the border with the proclaimed\r\npurpose of initiating an insurrection against President Diaz, escaped\r\ninto Texas. Extradition was refused on the ground that the alleged\r\noffense was political in its character, and therefore came within the\r\ntreaty proviso of nonsurrender. The Mexican contention was that the\r\nexception only related to purely political offenses, and that as\r\nGuerra's acts were admixed with the common crime of murder, arson,\r\nkidnaping, and robbery, the option of nondelivery became void, a\r\nposition which this Government was unable to admit in view of the\r\nreceived international doctrine and practice in the matter. The Mexican\r\nGovernment, in view of this, gave notice January 24, 1898, of the\r\ntermination of the convention, to take effect twelve months from that\r\ndate, at the same time inviting the conclusion of a new convention,\r\ntoward which negotiations are on foot.\r\n\r\nIn this relation I may refer to the necessity of some amendment of\r\nour existing extradition statute. It is a common stipulation of such\r\ntreaties that neither party shall be bound to give up its own citizens,\r\nwith the added proviso in one of our treaties, that with Japan, that it\r\nmay surrender if it see fit. It is held in this country by an almost\r\nuniform course of decisions that where a treaty negatives the obligation\r\nto surrender the President is not invested with legal authority to act.\r\nThe conferment of such authority would be in the line of that sound\r\nmorality which shrinks from affording secure asylum to the author of a\r\nheinous crime. Again, statutory provision might well be made for what is\r\nstyled extradition by way of transit, whereby a fugitive surrendered by\r\none foreign government to another may be conveyed across the territory\r\nof the United States to the jurisdiction of the demanding state.\r\nA recommendation in this behalf made in the President's message of\r\n1886[23] was not acted upon. The matter is presented for your\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the Mexican free zone has been often discussed with\r\nregard to its inconvenience as a provocative of smuggling into the\r\nUnited States along an extensive and thinly guarded land border.\r\nThe effort made by the joint resolution of March 1, 1895, to remedy the\r\nabuse charged by suspending the privilege of free transportation in\r\nbond across the territory of the United States to Mexico failed of good\r\nresult, as is stated in Report No. 702 of the House of Representatives,\r\nsubmitted in the last session, March 11, 1898. As the question is one to\r\nbe conveniently met by wise concurrent legislation of the two countries\r\nlooking to the protection of the revenues by harmonious measures\r\noperating equally on either side of the boundary, rather than by\r\nconventional arrangements, I suggest that Congress consider the\r\nadvisability of authorizing and inviting a conference of representatives\r\nof the Treasury Departments of the United States and Mexico to consider\r\nthe subject in all its complex bearings, and make report with pertinent\r\nrecommendations to the respective Governments for the information and\r\nconsideration of their Congresses.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican Water Boundary Commission has adjusted all matters\r\nsubmitted to it to the satisfaction of both Governments save in three\r\nimportant cases--that of the \"Chamizal\" at El Paso, Tex., where the two\r\ncommissioners failed to agree, and wherein, for this case only, this\r\nGovernment has proposed to Mexico the addition of a third member; the\r\nproposed elimination of what are known as \"Bancos,\" small isolated\r\nislands formed by the cutting off of bends in the Rio Grande, from\r\nthe operation of the treaties of 1884 and 1889, recommended by the\r\ncommissioners and approved by this Government, but still under\r\nconsideration by Mexico; and the subject of the \"Equitable distribution\r\nof the waters of the Rio Grande,\" for which the commissioners\r\nrecommended an international dam and reservoir, approved by Mexico, but\r\nstill under consideration by this Government. Pending these questions\r\nit is necessary to extend the life of the commission, which expires\r\nDecember 23 next.\r\n\r\nThe coronation of the young Queen of the Netherlands was made the\r\noccasion of fitting congratulations.\r\n\r\nThe claim of Victor H. McCord against Peru, which for a number of\r\nyears has been pressed by this Government and has on several occasions\r\nattracted the attention of the Congress, has been satisfactorily\r\nadjusted. A protocol was signed May 17, 1898, whereby, the fact of\r\nliability being admitted, the question of the amount to be awarded was\r\nsubmitted to the chief justice of Canada as sole arbitrator. His award\r\nsets the indemnity due the claimant at $40,000.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Peru has given the prescribed notification of its\r\nintention to abrogate the treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation\r\nconcluded with this country August 31, 1887. As that treaty contains\r\nmany important provisions necessary to the maintenance of commerce\r\nand good relations, which could with difficulty be replaced by the\r\nnegotiation of renewed provisions within the brief twelve months\r\nintervening before the treaty terminates, I have invited suggestions by\r\nPeru as to the particular provisions it is desired to annul, in the hope\r\nof reaching an arrangement whereby the remaining articles may be\r\nprovisionally saved.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty the Czar having announced his purpose to raise the\r\nImperial Russian mission at this capital to the rank of an embassy,\r\nI responded, under the authority conferred by the act of March 3,\r\n1893, by commissioning and accrediting the actual representative\r\nat St. Petersburg in the capacity of ambassador extraordinary and\r\nplenipotentiary. The Russian ambassador to this country has since\r\npresented his credentials.\r\n\r\nThe proposal of the Czar for a general reduction of the vast military\r\nestablishments that weigh so heavily upon many peoples in time of peace\r\nwas communicated to this Government with an earnest invitation to be\r\nrepresented in the conference which it is contemplated to assemble with\r\na view to discussing the means of accomplishing so desirable a result.\r\nHis Majesty was at once informed of the cordial sympathy of this\r\nGovernment with the principle involved in his exalted proposal and of\r\nthe readiness of the United States to take part in the conference.\r\nThe active military force of the United States, as measured by our\r\npopulation, territorial area, and taxable wealth, is, and under any\r\nconceivable prospective conditions must continue to be, in time of peace\r\nso conspicuously less than that of the armed powers to whom the Czar's\r\nappeal is especially addressed that the question can have for us no\r\npractical importance save as marking an auspicious step toward the\r\nbetterment of the condition of the modern peoples and the cultivation\r\nof peace and good will among them; but in this view it behooves us as\r\na nation to lend countenance and aid to the beneficent project.\r\n\r\nThe claims of owners of American sealing vessels for seizure by Russian\r\ncruisers in Bering Sea are being pressed to a settlement. The equities\r\nof the cases justify the expectation that a measure of reparation will\r\neventually be accorded in harmony with precedent and in the light of the\r\nproven facts.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation made in my special message of April 27 last is\r\nrenewed, that appropriation be made to reimburse the master and owners\r\nof the Russian bark _Hans_ for wrongful arrest of the master and\r\ndetention of the vessel in February, 1896, by officers of the United\r\nStates district court for the southern district of Mississippi. The\r\npapers accompanying my said message make out a most meritorious claim\r\nand justify the urgency with which it has been presented by the\r\nGovernment of Russia.\r\n\r\nMalietoa Laupepa, King of Samoa, died on August 22 last. According to\r\nArticle I of the general act of Berlin, \"his successor shall be duly\r\nelected according to the laws and customs of Samoa.\"\r\n\r\nArrangements having been agreed upon between the signatories of the\r\ngeneral act for the return of Mataafa and the other exiled Samoan\r\nchiefs, they were brought from Jaluit by a German war vessel and landed\r\nat Apia on September 18 last.\r\n\r\nWhether the death of Malietoa and the return of his old-time rival\r\nMataafa will add to the undesirable complications which the execution of\r\nthe tripartite general act has heretofore developed remains to be seen.\r\nThe efforts of this Government will, as heretofore, be addressed toward\r\na harmonious and exact fulfillment of the terms of the international\r\nengagement to which the United States became a party in 1889.\r\n\r\nThe Cheek claim against Siam, after some five years of controversy, has\r\nbeen adjusted by arbitration under an agreement signed July 6, 1897, an\r\naward of 706,721 ticals (about $187,987.78), with release of the Cheek\r\nestate from mortgage claims, having been rendered March 21, 1898, in\r\nfavor of the claimant by the arbitrator, Sir Nicholas John Hannen,\r\nBritish chief justice for China and Japan.\r\n\r\nAn envoy from Siam has been accredited to this Government and has\r\npresented his credentials.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the outbreak of the war with Spain the Swiss\r\nGovernment, fulfilling the high mission it has deservedly assumed as the\r\npatron of the International Red Cross, proposed to the United States and\r\nSpain that they should severally recognize and carry into execution,\r\nas a _modus vivendi_, during the continuance of hostilities, the\r\nadditional articles proposed by the international conference of Geneva,\r\nOctober 20, 1868, extending the effects of the existing Red Cross\r\nconvention of 1864 to the conduct of naval war. Following the example\r\nset by France and Germany in 1870 in adopting such a _modus vivendi_,\r\nand in view of the accession of the United States to those additional\r\narticles in 1882, although the exchange of ratifications thereof still\r\nremained uneffected, the Swiss proposal was promptly and cordially\r\naccepted by us, and simultaneously by Spain.\r\n\r\nThis Government feels a keen satisfaction in having thus been enabled to\r\ntestify its adherence to the broadest principles of humanity even amidst\r\nthe clash of war, and it is to be hoped that the extension of the Red\r\nCross compact to hostilities by sea as well as on land may soon become\r\nan accomplished fact through the general promulgation of the additional\r\nnaval Red Cross articles by the maritime powers now parties to the\r\nconvention of 1864.\r\n\r\nThe important question of the claim of Switzerland to the perpetual\r\ncantonal allegiance of American citizens of Swiss origin has not made\r\nhopeful progress toward a solution, and controversies in this regard\r\nstill continue.\r\n\r\nThe newly accredited envoy of the United States to the Ottoman Porte\r\ncarries instructions looking to the disposal of matters in controversy\r\nwith Turkey for a number of years. He is especially charged to press for\r\na just settlement of our claims for indemnity by reason of the\r\ndestruction of the property of American missionaries resident in that\r\ncountry during the Armenian troubles of 1895, as well as for the\r\nrecognition of older claims of equal justness.\r\n\r\nHe is also instructed to seek an adjustment of the dispute growing\r\nout of the refusal of Turkey to recognize the acquired citizenship of\r\nOttoman-born persons naturalized in the United States since 1869 without\r\nprior imperial consent, and in the same general relation he is directed\r\nto endeavor to bring about a solution of the question which has more or\r\nless acutely existed since 1869 concerning the jurisdictional rights of\r\nthe United States in matters of criminal procedure and punishment under\r\nArticle IV of the treaty of 1830. This latter difficulty grows out of a\r\nverbal difference, claimed by Turkey to be essential, between the\r\noriginal Turkish text and the promulgated translation.\r\n\r\nAfter more than two years from the appointment of a consul of this\r\ncountry to Erzerum, he has received his exequatur.\r\n\r\nThe arbitral tribunal appointed under the treaty of February 2, 1897,\r\nbetween Great Britain and Venezuela, to determine the boundary line\r\nbetween the latter and the colony of British Guiana, is to convene at\r\nParis during the present month. It is a source of much gratification to\r\nthis Government to see the friendly resort of arbitration applied to the\r\nsettlement of this controversy, not alone because of the earnest part we\r\nhave had in bringing about the result, but also because the two members\r\nnamed on behalf of Venezuela, Mr. Chief Justice Fuller and Mr. Justice\r\nBrewer, chosen from our highest court, appropriately testify the\r\ncontinuing interest we feel in the definitive adjustment of the question\r\naccording to the strictest rules of justice. The British members,\r\nLord Herschell and Sir Richard Collins, are jurists of no less exalted\r\nrepute, while the fifth member and president of the tribunal, M.F.\r\nDe Martens, has earned a world-wide reputation as an authority upon\r\ninternational law.\r\n\r\nThe claim of Felipe Scandella against Venezuela for arbitrary expulsion\r\nand injury to his business has been adjusted by the revocation of the\r\norder of expulsion and by the payment of the sum of $16,000.\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction of being able to state that the Bureau of\r\nthe American Republics, created in 1890 as the organ for promoting\r\ncommercial intercourse and fraternal relations among the countries of\r\nthe Western Hemisphere, has become a more efficient instrument of the\r\nwise purposes of its founders, and is receiving the cordial support of\r\nthe contributing members of the international union which are actually\r\nrepresented in its board of management. A commercial directory, in two\r\nvolumes, containing a mass of statistical matter descriptive of the\r\nindustrial and commercial interests of the various countries, has been\r\nprinted in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French, and a monthly\r\nbulletin published in these four languages and distributed in the\r\nLatin-American countries as well as in the United States has proved to\r\nbe a valuable medium for disseminating information and furthering the\r\nvaried interests of the international union.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the important work of collecting information of\r\npractical benefit to American industries and trade through the agency\r\nof the diplomatic and consular officers has been steadily advanced, and\r\nin order to lay such data before the public with the least delay the\r\npractice was begun in January, 1898, of issuing the commercial reports\r\nfrom day to day as they are received by the Department of State. It is\r\nbelieved that for promptitude as well as fullness of information the\r\nservice thus supplied to our merchants and manufacturers will be found\r\nto show sensible improvement and to merit the liberal support of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe experiences of the last year bring forcibly home to us a sense of\r\nthe burdens and the waste of war. We desire, in common with most\r\ncivilized nations, to reduce to the lowest possible point the damage\r\nsustained in time of war-by peaceable trade and commerce. It is true we\r\nmay suffer in such cases less than other communities, but all nations\r\nare damaged more or less by the state of uneasiness and apprehension\r\ninto which an outbreak of hostilities throws the entire commercial\r\nworld. It should be our object, therefore, to minimize, so far as\r\npracticable, this inevitable loss and disturbance. This purpose can\r\nprobably best be accomplished by an international agreement to regard\r\nall private property at sea as exempt from capture or destruction by the\r\nforces of belligerent powers. The United States Government has for many\r\nyears advocated this humane and beneficent principle, and is now in\r\nposition to recommend it to other powers without the imputation of\r\nselfish motives. I therefore suggest for your consideration that the\r\nExecutive be authorized to correspond with the governments of the\r\nprincipal maritime powers with a view of incorporating into the\r\npermanent law of civilized nations the principle of the exemption of\r\nall private property at sea, not contraband of war, from capture or\r\ndestruction by belligerent powers.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury reports that the receipts of the\r\nGovernment from all sources during the fiscal year ended June 30,\r\n1898, including $64,751,223 received from sale of Pacific railroads,\r\namounted to $405,321,335 and its expenditures to $443,368,582. There\r\nwas collected from customs $149,575,062 and from internal revenue\r\n$170,900,641. Our dutiable imports amounted to $324,635,479, a decrease\r\nof $58,156,690 over the preceding year, and importations free of duty\r\namounted to $291,414,175, a decrease from the preceding year of\r\n$90,524,068. Internal-revenue receipts exceeded those of the preceding\r\nyear by $24,212,067.\r\n\r\nThe total tax collected on distilled spirits was $92,546,999;\r\non manufactured tobacco, $36,230,522, and on fermented liquors,\r\n$39,515,421. We exported merchandise during the year amounting to\r\n$1,231,482,330, an increase of $180,488,774 from the preceding year.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated upon the basis of present revenue laws that the\r\nreceipts of the Government for the year ending June 30, 1899, will\r\nbe $577,874,647, and its expenditures $689,874,647, resulting in a\r\ndeficiency of $112,000,000.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of December, 1898, there was held in the Treasury gold coin\r\namounting to $138,441,547, gold bullion amounting to $138,502,545,\r\nsilver bullion amounting to $93,359,250, and other forms of money\r\namounting to $451,963,981.\r\n\r\nOn the same date the amount of money of all kinds in circulation, or not\r\nincluded in Treasury holdings, was $1,886,879,504, an increase for the\r\nyear of $165,794,966. Estimating our population at 75,194,000 at the\r\ntime mentioned, the per capita circulation was $25.09. On the same date\r\nthere was in the Treasury gold bullion amounting to $138,502,545.\r\n\r\nThe provisions made for strengthening the resources of the Treasury in\r\nconnection with the war have given increased confidence in the purpose\r\nand power of the Government to maintain the present standard, and have\r\nestablished more firmly than ever the national credit at home and\r\nabroad. A marked evidence of this is found in the inflow of gold to the\r\nTreasury. Its net gold holdings on November 1, 1898, were $239,885,162\r\nas compared with $153,573,147 on November 1, 1897, and an increase of\r\nnet cash of $207,756,100, November 1, 1897, to $300,238,275, November 1,\r\n1898. The present ratio of net Treasury gold to outstanding Government\r\nliabilities, including United States notes, Treasury notes of 1890,\r\nsilver certificates, currency certificates, standard silver dollars,\r\nand fractional silver coin, November 1, 1898, was 25.35 per cent, as\r\ncompared with 16.96 per cent, November 1, 1897.\r\n\r\nI renew so much of my recommendation of December, 1897, as follows:\r\n\r\n  That when any of the United States notes are presented for redemption\r\n  in gold and are redeemed in gold, such notes shall be kept and set\r\n  apart and only paid out in exchange for gold. This is an obvious duty.\r\n  If the holder of the United States note prefers the gold and gets it\r\n  from the Government, he should not receive back from the Government a\r\n  United States note without paying gold in exchange for it. The reason\r\n  for this is made all the more apparent when the Government issues an\r\n  interest-bearing debt to provide gold for the redemption of United\r\n  States notes--a non-interest-bearing debt. Surely it should not pay\r\n  them out again except on demand and for gold. If they are put out in\r\n  any other way, they may return again, to be followed by another bond\r\n  issue to redeem them--another interest-bearing debt to redeem a\r\n  non-interest-bearing debt.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis recommendation was made in the belief that such provisions of law\r\nwould insure to a greater degree the safety of the present standard, and\r\nbetter protect our currency from the dangers to which it is subjected\r\nfrom a disturbance in the general business conditions of the country.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment the present condition of the Treasury amply justifies the\r\nimmediate enactment of the legislation recommended one year ago, under\r\nwhich a portion of the gold holdings should be placed in a trust fund\r\nfrom which greenbacks should be redeemed upon presentation, but when\r\nonce redeemed should not thereafter be paid out except for gold.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be inferred that other legislation relating to our currency\r\nis not required; on the contrary, there is an obvious demand for it.\r\n\r\nThe importance of adequate provision which will insure to our future a\r\nmoney standard related as our money standard now is to that of our\r\ncommercial rivals is generally recognized.\r\n\r\nThe companion proposition that our domestic paper currency shall be kept\r\nsafe and yet be so related to the needs of our industries and internal\r\ncommerce as to be adequate and responsive to such needs is a proposition\r\nscarcely less important. The subject, in all its parts, is commended to\r\nthe wise consideration of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe annexation of Hawaii and the changed relations of the United States\r\nto Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines resulting from the war, compel\r\nthe prompt adoption of a maritime policy by the United States. There\r\nshould be established regular and frequent steamship communication,\r\nencouraged by the United States, under the American flag, with the newly\r\nacquired islands. Spain furnished to its colonies, at an annual cost of\r\nabout $2,000,000, steamship lines communicating with a portion of the\r\nworld's markets, as well as with trade centers of the home Government.\r\nThe United States will not undertake to do less. It is our duty to\r\nfurnish the people of Hawaii with facilities, under national control,\r\nfor their export and import trade. It will be conceded that the present\r\nsituation calls for legislation which shall be prompt, durable, and\r\nliberal.\r\n\r\nThe part which American merchant vessels and their seamen performed\r\nin the war with Spain demonstrates that this service, furnishing both\r\npickets and the second line of defense, is a national necessity, and\r\nshould be encouraged in every constitutional way. Details and methods\r\nfor the accomplishment of this purpose are discussed in the report of\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, to which the attention of Congress is\r\nrespectfully invited.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I recommended that Congress authorize the\r\nappointment of a commission for the purpose of making systematic\r\ninvestigations with reference to the cause and prevention of yellow\r\nfever. This matter has acquired an increased importance as a result\r\nof the military occupation of the island of Cuba and the commercial\r\nintercourse between this island and the United States which we have\r\nevery reason to expect. The sanitary problems connected with our new\r\nrelations with the island of Cuba and the acquisition of Puerto Rico\r\nare no less important than those relating to finance, commerce, and\r\nadministration. It is my earnest desire that these problems may be\r\nconsidered by competent experts and that everything may be done\r\nwhich the most recent advances in sanitary science can offer for the\r\nprotection of the health of our soldiers in those islands and of\r\nour citizens who are exposed to the dangers of infection from the\r\nimportation of yellow fever. I therefore renew my recommendation that\r\nthe authority of Congress may be given and a suitable appropriation made\r\nto provide for a commission of experts to be appointed for the purpose\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nUnder the act of Congress approved April 26, 1898, authorizing the\r\nPresident in his discretion, \"upon a declaration of war by Congress, or\r\na declaration by Congress that war exists,\" I directed the increase of\r\nthe Regular Army to the maximum of 62,000, authorized in said act.\r\n\r\nThere are now in the Regular Army 57,862 officers and men. In said act\r\nit was provided--\r\n\r\n  That at the end of any war in which the United States may become\r\n  involved the Army shall be reduced to a peace basis by the transfer\r\n  in the same arm of the service or absorption by promotion or honorable\r\n  discharge, under such regulations as the Secretary of War may establish,\r\n  of supernumerary commissioned officers and the honorable discharge or\r\n  transfer of supernumerary enlisted men; and nothing contained in this\r\n  act shall be construed as authorizing the permanent increase of the\r\n  commissioned or enlisted force of the Regular Army beyond that now\r\n  provided by the law in force prior to the passage of this act,\r\n  except as to the increase of twenty-five majors provided for in\r\n  section I hereof.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe importance of legislation for the permanent increase of the Army is\r\ntherefore manifest, and the recommendation of the Secretary of War for\r\nthat purpose has my unqualified approval. There can be no question that\r\nat this time, and probably for some time in the future, 100,000 men\r\nwill be none too many to meet the necessities of the situation. At all\r\nevents, whether that number shall be required permanently or not, the\r\npower should be given to the President to enlist that force if in his\r\ndiscretion it should be necessary; and the further discretion should\r\nbe given him to recruit for the Army within the above limit from the\r\ninhabitants of the islands with the government of which we are charged.\r\nIt is my purpose to muster out the entire Volunteer Army as soon as the\r\nCongress shall provide for the increase of the regular establishment.\r\nThis will be only an act of justice and will be much appreciated by the\r\nbrave men who left their homes and employments to help the country in\r\nits emergency.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I stated:\r\n\r\n  The Union Pacific Railway, main line, was sold under the decree of the\r\n  United States court for the district of Nebraska on the 1st and 2d of\r\n  November of this year. The amount due the Government consisted of the\r\n  principal of the subsidy bonds, $27,236,512, and the accrued interest\r\n  thereon, $31,211,711.75, making the total indebtedness $58,448,223.75.\r\n  The bid at the sale covered the first-mortgage lien and the entire\r\n  mortgage claim of the Government, principal and interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis left the Kansas Pacific case unconcluded. By a decree of the court\r\nin that case an upset price for the property was fixed at a sum which\r\nwould yield to the Government only $2,500,000 upon its lien. The sale,\r\nat the instance of the Government, was postponed first to December 15,\r\n1897, and later, upon the application of the United States, was\r\npostponed to the 16th day of February, 1898.\r\n\r\nHaving satisfied myself that the interests of the Government required\r\nthat an effort should be made to obtain a larger sum, I directed the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, under the act passed March 3, 1887, to pay\r\nout of the Treasury to the persons entitled to receive the same the\r\namounts due upon all prior mortgages upon the Eastern and Middle\r\ndivisions of said railroad out of any money in the Treasury not\r\notherwise appropriated, whereupon the Attorney-General prepared a\r\npetition to be presented to the court, offering to redeem said prior\r\nliens in such manner as the court might direct, and praying that\r\nthereupon the United States might be held to be subrogated to all the\r\nrights of said prior lien holders and that a receiver might be appointed\r\nto take possession of the mortgaged premises and maintain and operate\r\nthe same until the court or Congress otherwise directed. Thereupon the\r\nreorganization committee agreed that if said petition was withdrawn and\r\nthe sale allowed to proceed on the 16th of February, 1898, they would\r\nbid a sum at the sale which would realize to the Government the entire\r\nprincipal of its debt, $6,303,000.\r\n\r\nBelieving that no better price could be obtained and appreciating the\r\ndifficulties under which the Government would labor if it should become\r\nthe purchaser of the road at the sale, in the absence of any authority\r\nby Congress to take charge of and operate the road I directed that upon\r\nthe guaranty of a minimum bid which should give the Government the\r\nprincipal of its debt the sale should proceed. By this transaction the\r\nGovernment secured an advance of $3,803,000 over and above the sum which\r\nthe court had fixed as the upset price, and which the reorganization\r\ncommittee had declared was the maximum which they would pay for the\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nIt is a gratifying fact that the result of these proceedings against the\r\nUnion Pacific system and the Kansas Pacific line is that the Government\r\nhas received on account of its subsidy claim the sum of $64,751,223.75,\r\nan increase of $18,997,163.76 over the sum which the reorganization\r\ncommittee originally agreed to bid for the joint property, the\r\nGovernment receiving its whole claim, principal and interest, on the\r\nUnion Pacific, and the principal of its debt on the Kansas Pacific\r\nRailroad.\r\n\r\nSteps had been taken to foreclose the Government's lien upon the Central\r\nPacific Railroad Company, but before action was commenced Congress\r\npassed an act, approved July 7, 1898, creating a commission consisting\r\nof the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney-General, and the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, and their successors in office, with full\r\npower to settle the indebtedness to the Government growing out of the\r\nissue of bonds in aid of the construction of the Central Pacific and\r\nWestern Pacific bond-aided railroads, subject to the approval of the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nNo report has yet been made to me by the commission thus created.\r\nWhatever action is had looking to a settlement of the indebtedness in\r\naccordance with the act referred to will be duly submitted to the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nI deem it my duty to call to the attention of Congress the condition of\r\nthe present building occupied by the Department of Justice. The business\r\nof that Department has increased very greatly since it was established\r\nin its present quarters. The building now occupied by it is neither\r\nlarge enough nor of suitable arrangement for the proper accommodation of\r\nthe business of the Department. The Supervising Architect has pronounced\r\nit unsafe and unsuited for the use to which it is put. The\r\nAttorney-General in his report states that the library of the Department\r\nis upon the fourth floor, and that all the space allotted to it is so\r\ncrowded with books as to dangerously overload the structure. The first\r\nfloor is occupied by the Court of Claims. The building is of an old and\r\ndilapidated appearance, unsuited to the dignity which should attach to\r\nthis important Department.\r\n\r\nA proper regard for the safety, comfort, and convenience of the officers\r\nand employees would justify the expenditure of a liberal sum of money in\r\nthe erection of, a new building of commodious proportions and handsome\r\nappearance upon the very advantageous site already secured for that\r\npurpose, including the ground occupied by the present structure and\r\nadjoining vacant lot, comprising in all a frontage of 201 feet on\r\nPennsylvania avenue and a depth of 136 feet.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I may likewise refer to the inadequate accommodations\r\nprovided for the Supreme Court in the Capitol, and suggest the wisdom of\r\nmaking provision for the erection of a separate building for the court\r\nand its officers and library upon available ground near the Capitol.\r\n\r\nThe postal service of the country advances with extraordinary growth.\r\nWithin twenty years both the revenues and the expenditures of the\r\nPost-Office Department have multiplied threefold. In the last ten years\r\nthey have nearly doubled. Our postal business grows much more rapidly\r\nthan our population. It now involves an expenditure of $100,000,000 a\r\nyear, numbers 73,000 post-offices, and enrolls 200,000 employees. This\r\nremarkable extension of a service which is an accurate index of the\r\npublic conditions presents gratifying evidence of the advancement of\r\neducation, of the increase of communication and business activity, and\r\nof the improvement of mail facilities leading to their constantly\r\naugmenting use.\r\n\r\nThe war with Spain laid new and exceptional labors on the Post-Office\r\nDepartment. The mustering of the military and naval forces of the United\r\nStates required special mail arrangements for every camp and every\r\ncampaign. The communication between home and camp was naturally eager\r\nand expectant. In some of the larger places of rendezvous as many as\r\n50,000 letters a day required handling. This necessity was met by the\r\nprompt detail and dispatch of experienced men from the established force\r\nand by directing all the instrumentalities of the railway mail and\r\npost-office service, so far as necessary, to this new need. Congress\r\npassed an act empowering the Postmaster-General to establish offices or\r\nbranches at every military camp or station, and under this authority the\r\npostal machinery was speedily put into effective operation.\r\n\r\nUnder the same authority, when our forces moved upon Cuba, Puerto\r\nRico, and the Philippines they were attended and followed by the postal\r\nservice. Though the act of Congress authorized the appointment of\r\npostmasters where necessary, it was early determined that the public\r\ninterests would best be subserved, not by new designations, but by the\r\ndetail of experienced men familiar with every branch of the service,\r\nand this policy was steadily followed. When the territory which was the\r\ntheater of conflict came into our possession, it became necessary to\r\nreestablish mail facilities for the resident population as well as to\r\nprovide them for our forces of occupation, and the former requirement\r\nwas met through the extension and application of the latter obligation.\r\nI gave the requisite authority, and the same general principle was\r\napplied to this as to other branches of civil administration under\r\nmilitary occupation. The details are more particularly given in the\r\nreport of the Postmaster-General, and, while the work is only just\r\nbegun, it is pleasing to be able to say that the service in the\r\nterritory which has come under our control is already materially\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nThe following recommendations of the Secretary of the Navy relative to\r\nthe increase of the Navy have my earnest approval:\r\n\r\n1. Three seagoing sheathed and coppered battle ships of about 13,500\r\ntons trial displacement, carrying the heaviest armor and most powerful\r\nordnance for vessels of their class, and to have the highest practicable\r\nspeed and great radius of action. Estimated cost, exclusive of armor and\r\narmament, $3,600,000 each.\r\n\r\n2. Three sheathed and coppered armored cruisers of about 12,000 tons\r\ntrial displacement, carrying the heaviest armor and most powerful\r\nordnance for vessels of their class, and to have the highest practicable\r\nspeed and great radius of action. Estimated cost, exclusive of armor and\r\narmament, $4,000,000 each.\r\n\r\n3. Three sheathed and coppered protected cruisers of about 6,000 tons\r\ntrial displacement, to have the highest practicable speed and great\r\nradius of action, and to carry the most powerful ordnance suitable for\r\nvessels of their class. Estimated cost, exclusive of armor and armament,\r\n$2,150,000 each.\r\n\r\n4. Six sheathed and coppered cruisers of about 2,500 tons trial\r\ndisplacement, to have the highest speed compatible with good cruising\r\nqualities, great radius of action, and to carry the most powerful\r\nordnance suited to vessels of their class. Estimated cost, exclusive\r\nof armament, $1,141,800 each.\r\n\r\nI join with the Secretary of the Navy in recommending that the grades\r\nof admiral and vice-admiral be temporarily revived, to be filled by\r\nofficers who have specially distinguished themselves in the war with\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nI earnestly urge upon Congress the importance of early legislation\r\nproviding for the taking of the Twelfth Census. This is necessary in\r\nview of the large amount of work which must be performed in the\r\npreparation of the schedules preparatory to the enumeration of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThere were on the pension rolls on June 30, 1898, 993,714 names, an\r\nincrease of nearly 18,000 over the number on the rolls on the same day\r\nof the preceding year. The amount appropriated by the act of December\r\n22, 1896, for the payment of pensions for the fiscal year of 1898\r\nwas $140,000,000. Eight million seventy thousand eight hundred and\r\nseventy-two dollars and forty-six cents was appropriated by the act of\r\nMarch 31, 1898, to cover deficiencies in army pensions, and repayments\r\nin the sum of $12,020.33, making a total of $148,082,892.79 available\r\nfor the payment of pensions during the fiscal year 1898. The amount\r\ndisbursed from that sum was $144,651,879.80, leaving a balance of\r\n$3,431,012.99 unexpended on the 30th of June, 1898, which was covered\r\ninto the Treasury. There were 389 names added to the rolls during the\r\nyear by special acts passed at the second session of the Fifty-fifth\r\nCongress, making a total of 6,486 pensioners by Congressional enactments\r\nsince 1861.\r\n\r\nThe total receipts of the Patent Office during the past year were\r\n$1,253,948.44. The expenditures were $1,081,633.79, leaving a surplus\r\nof $172,314.65.\r\n\r\nThe public lands disposed of by the Government during the year reached\r\n8,453,896.92 acres, an increase of 614,780.26 acres over the previous\r\nyear. The total receipts from public lands during the fiscal year\r\namounted to $2,277,995.18, an increase of $190,063.90 over the preceding\r\nyear. The lands embraced in the eleven forest reservations which were\r\nsuspended by the act of June 4, 1897, again became subject to the\r\noperations of the proclamations of February 22, 1897, creating them,\r\nwhich added an estimated amount of 19,951,360 acres to the area embraced\r\nin the reserves previously created. In addition thereto two new reserves\r\nwere created during the year--the Pine Mountain and Zaca Lake Reserve,\r\nin California, embracing 1,644,594 acres, and the Prescott Reserve, in\r\nArizona, embracing 10,240 acres--while the Pecos River Reserve, in New\r\nMexico, has been changed and enlarged to include 120,000 additional\r\nacres.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year thirty forest reservations, not including those\r\nof the Afognak Forest and the Fish-Culture Reserve, in Alaska, had been\r\ncreated by Executive proclamations under section 24 of the act of March\r\n3, 1891, embracing an estimated area of 40,719,474 acres.\r\n\r\nThe Department of the Interior has inaugurated a forest system, made\r\npossible by the act of July, 1898, for a graded force of officers in\r\ncontrol of the reserves. This system has only been in full operation\r\nsince August, but good results have already been secured in many\r\nsections. The reports received indicate that the system of patrol has\r\nnot only prevented destructive fires from gaining headway, but has\r\ndiminished the number of fires.\r\n\r\nThe special attention of the Congress is called to that part of\r\nthe report of the Secretary of the Interior in relation to the Five\r\nCivilized Tribes. It is noteworthy that the general condition of the\r\nIndians shows marked progress. But one outbreak of a serious character\r\noccurred during the year, and that among the Chippewa Indians of\r\nMinnesota, which happily has been suppressed.\r\n\r\nWhile it has not yet been practicable to enforce all the provisions\r\nof the act of June 28, 1898, \"for the protection of the people of the\r\nIndian Territory, and for other purposes,\" it is having a salutary\r\neffect upon the nations composing the five tribes. The Dawes Commission\r\nreports that the most gratifying results and greater advance toward the\r\nattainment of the objects of the Government have been secured in the\r\npast year than in any previous year. I can not too strongly indorse the\r\nrecommendation of the commission and of the Secretary of the Interior\r\nfor the necessity of providing for the education of the 30,000 white\r\nchildren resident in the Indian Territory.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture has been active in the past year.\r\nExplorers have been sent to many of the countries of the Eastern and\r\nWestern hemispheres for seeds and plants that may be useful to the\r\nUnited States, and with the further view of opening up markets for our\r\nsurplus products. The Forestry Division of the Department is giving\r\nspecial attention to the treeless regions of our country and is\r\nintroducing species specially adapted to semiarid regions. Forest fires,\r\nwhich seriously interfere with production, especially in irrigated\r\nregions, are being studied, that losses from this cause may be avoided.\r\nThe Department is inquiring into the use and abuse of water in many\r\nStates of the West, and collating information regarding the laws of the\r\nStates, the decisions of the courts, and the customs of the people in\r\nthis regard, so that uniformity may be secured. Experiment stations are\r\nbecoming more effective every year. The annual appropriation of $720,000\r\nby Congress is supplemented by $400,000 from the States. Nation-wide\r\nexperiments have been conducted to ascertain the suitableness as to soil\r\nand climate and States for growing sugar beets. The number of sugar\r\nfactories has been doubled in the past two years, and the ability of the\r\nUnited States to produce its own sugar from this source has been clearly\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\nThe Weather Bureau forecast and observation stations have been extended\r\naround the Caribbean Sea, to give early warning of the approach of\r\nhurricanes from the south seas to our fleets and merchant marine.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1900 will occur the centennial anniversary of the founding\r\nof the city of Washington for the permanent capital of the Government of\r\nthe United States by authority of an act of Congress approved July 16,\r\n1790. In May, 1800, the archives and general offices of the Federal\r\nGovernment were removed to this place. On the 17th of November, 1800,\r\nthe National Congress met here for the first time and assumed exclusive\r\ncontrol of the Federal district and city. This interesting event assumes\r\nall the more significance when we recall the circumstances attending the\r\nchoosing of the site, the naming of the capital in honor of the Father\r\nof his Country, and the interest taken by him in the adoption of plans\r\nfor its future development on a magnificent scale.\r\n\r\nThese original plans have been wrought out with a constant progress and\r\na signal success even beyond anything their framers could have foreseen.\r\nThe people of the country are justly proud of the distinctive beauty and\r\ngovernment of the capital and of the rare instruments of science and\r\neducation which here find their natural home.\r\n\r\nA movement lately inaugurated by the citizens to have the anniversary\r\ncelebrated with fitting ceremonies, including, perhaps, the\r\nestablishment of a handsome permanent memorial to mark so historical an\r\noccasion and to give it more than local recognition, has met with\r\ngeneral favor on the part of the public.\r\n\r\nI recommend to the Congress the granting of an appropriation for this\r\npurpose and the appointment of a committee from its respective bodies.\r\nIt might also be advisable to authorize the President to appoint a\r\ncommittee from the country at large, which, acting with the\r\nCongressional and District of Columbia committees, can complete the\r\nplans for an appropriate national celebration.\r\n\r\nThe alien contract law is shown by experience to need some amendment; a\r\nmeasure providing better protection for seamen is proposed; the rightful\r\napplication of the eight-hour law for the benefit of labor and of the\r\nprinciple of arbitration are suggested for consideration; and I commend\r\nthese subjects to the careful attention of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe several departmental reports will be laid before you. They give in\r\ngreat detail the conduct of the affairs of the Government during the\r\npast year and discuss many questions upon which the Congress may feel\r\ncalled upon to act.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: See pp. 127-136.]\r\n[Footnote 13: pp. 139-150.]\r\n[Footnote 14: See pp. 202-203.]\r\n[Footnote 15: See pp. 203-204.]\r\n[Footnote 16: See pp. 153-155.]\r\n[Footnote 17: See p. 201.]\r\n[Footnote 18: See p. 155.]\r\n[Footnote 19: See pp. 204-205.]\r\n[Footnote 20: See pp. 203-204.]\r\n[Footnote 21: See pp. 205-206.]\r\n[Footnote 22: See pp. 206-207.]\r\n[Footnote 23: See Vol. VIII, pp. 501-503.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ACT declaring that war exists between the United States of America\r\nand the Kingdom of Spain.\r\n\r\n_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\nUnited States of America in Congress assembled_, First.

The Hawaiian\r\nIslands and Guam becoming United States territory and forming convenient\r\nstopping places on the way across the sea, the necessity for speedy\r\ncable communication between the United States and all these Pacific\r\nislands has become imperative.\r\n\r\nSuch communication should be established in such a way as to be wholly\r\nunder the control of the United States, whether in time of peace or of\r\nwar. At present the Philippines can be reached only by cables which\r\npass through many foreign countries, and the Hawaiian Islands and Guam\r\ncan only be communicated with by steamers, involving delays in each\r\ninstance of at least a week. The present conditions should not be\r\nallowed to continue for a moment longer than is absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nSo long ago as 1885 reference was made in an Executive message to\r\nCongress to the necessity for cable communication between the United\r\nStates and Hawaii. This necessity has greatly increased since then.\r\nThe question has been discussed in the Fifty-second, Fifty-fourth, and\r\nFifty-fifth Congresses, in each of which some effort has been made\r\nlooking toward laying a cable at least as far as the Hawaiian Islands.\r\nThe time has now arrived when a cable in the Pacific must extend at\r\nleast as far as Manila, touching at the Hawaiian Islands and Guam on\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\nTwo methods of establishing this cable communication at once suggest\r\nthemselves: First, construction and maintenance of such a cable by\r\nand at the expense of the United States Government, and, second,\r\nconstruction and maintenance of such a cable by a private United States\r\ncorporation, under such safeguards as Congress shall impose.\r\n\r\nI do not make any recommendations to Congress as to which of these\r\nmethods would be the more desirable. A cable of the length of that\r\nproposed requires so much time for construction and laying that it is\r\nestimated that at least two years must elapse after giving the order for\r\nthe cable before the entire system could be successfully laid and put in\r\noperation. Further deep-sea soundings must be taken west of the Hawaiian\r\nIslands before the final route for the cable can be selected. Under\r\nthese circumstances it becomes a paramount necessity that measures\r\nshould be taken before the close of the present Congress to provide such\r\nmeans as may seem most suitable for the establishment of a cable system.\r\n\r\nI commend the whole subject to the careful consideration of the Congress\r\nand to such prompt action as may seem advisable.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas by a joint resolution passed by the Congress and approved April\r\n20, 1898,[24] and communicated to the Government of Spain, it was\r\ndemanded that said Government at once relinquish its authority and\r\ngovernment in the island of Cuba and withdraw its land and naval forces\r\nfrom Cuba and Cuban waters, and the President of the United States was\r\ndirected and empowered to use the entire land and naval forces of the\r\nUnited States and to call into the actual service of the United States\r\nthe militia of the several States to such extent as might be necessary\r\nto carry said resolution into effect; and\r\n\r\nWhereas in carrying into effect said resolution the President of the\r\nUnited States deems it necessary to set on foot and maintain a blockade\r\nof the north coast of Cuba, including all ports on said coast between\r\nCardenas and Bahia Honda, and the port of Cienfuegos, on the south coast\r\nof Cuba:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, William McKinley, President of the United States, in\r\norder to enforce the said resolution, do hereby declare and proclaim\r\nthat the United States of America have instituted and will maintain a\r\nblockade of the north coast of Cuba, including ports on said coast\r\nbetween Cardenas and Bahia Honda, and the port of Cienfuegos, on the\r\nsouth coast of Cuba, aforesaid, in pursuance of the laws of the United\r\nStates and the law of nations applicable to such cases. An efficient\r\nforce will be posted so as to prevent the entrance and exit of vessels\r\nfrom the ports aforesaid. Any neutral vessel approaching any of said\r\nports or attempting to leave the same without notice or knowledge of the\r\nestablishment of such blockade will be duly warned by the commander of\r\nthe blockading forces, who will indorse on her register the fact and the\r\ndate of such warning, where such indorsement was made; and if the same\r\nvessel shall again attempt to enter any blockaded port she will be\r\ncaptured and sent to the nearest convenient port for such proceedings\r\nagainst her and her cargo as prize as may be deemed advisable.\r\n\r\nNeutral vessels lying in any of said ports at the time of the\r\nestablishment of such blockade will be allowed thirty days to issue\r\ntherefrom.

We have been blessed by abundant harvests; our trade and commerce\r\nhave wonderfully increased; our public credit has been improved and\r\nstrengthened; all sections of our common country have been brought\r\ntogether and knitted into closer bonds of national purpose and unity.\r\n\r\nThe skies have been for a time darkened by the cloud of war, but as we\r\nwere compelled to take up the sword in the cause of humanity we are\r\npermitted to rejoice that the conflict has been of brief duration and\r\nthe losses we have had to mourn, though grievous and important, have\r\nbeen so few, considering the great results accomplished, as to inspire\r\nus with gratitude and praise to the Lord of Hosts. We may laud and\r\nmagnify His holy name that the cessation of hostilities came so soon as\r\nto spare both sides the countless sorrows and disasters that attend\r\nprotracted war.\r\n\r\nI do therefore invite all my fellow-citizens, as well those who may be\r\nat sea or sojourning in foreign lands as those at home, to set apart\r\nand observe Thursday, the 24th day of November, as a day of national\r\nthanksgiving, to come together in their several places of worship for a\r\nservice of praise and thanks to Almighty God for all the blessings of\r\nthe year, for the mildness of the seasons and the fruitfulness of the\r\nsoil, for the continued prosperity of the people, for the devotion and\r\nvalor of our countrymen, for the glory of our victory and the hope of a\r\nrighteous peace, and to pray that the divine guidance which has brought\r\nus heretofore to safety and honor may be graciously continued in the\r\nyears to come.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 28th day of October, A.D. 1898, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States the one hundred and\r\ntwenty-third.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JOHN HAY,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDERS.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, May 7, 1898_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEWEY,\r\n  _Care American Consul, Hongkong_:\r\n\r\nThe President, in the name of the American people, thanks you and your\r\nofficers and men for your splendid achievement and overwhelming victory.\r\n\r\nIn recognition he has appointed you acting rear-admiral and will\r\nrecommend a vote of thanks to you by Congress as a foundation for\r\nfurther promotion.\r\n\r\nLONG.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, May 19, 1898_.\r\n\r\nThe SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nSIR: The destruction of the Spanish fleet at Manila, followed by the\r\ntaking of the naval station at Cavite, the paroling of the garrisons,\r\nand the acquisition of the control of the bay, has rendered it\r\nnecessary, in the further prosecution of the measures adopted by this\r\nGovernment for the purpose of bringing about an honorable and durable\r\npeace with Spain, to send an army of occupation to the Philippines for\r\nthe twofold purpose of completing the reduction of the Spanish power in\r\nthat quarter and of giving order and security to the islands while in\r\nthe possession of the United States. For the command of this expedition\r\nI have designated Major-General Wesley Merritt, and it now becomes my\r\nduty to give instructions as to the manner in which the movement shall\r\nbe conducted.\r\n\r\nThe first effect of the military occupation of the enemy's territory is\r\nthe severance of the former political relations of the inhabitants and\r\nthe establishment of a new political power. Under this changed condition\r\nof things the inhabitants, so long as they perform their duties, are\r\nentitled to security in their persons and property and in all their\r\nprivate rights and relations. It is my desire that the people of the\r\nPhilippines should be acquainted with the purpose of the United States\r\nto discharge to the fullest extent its obligations in this regard.\r\nIt will therefore be the duty of the commander of the expedition,\r\nimmediately upon his arrival in the islands, to publish a proclamation\r\ndeclaring that we come not to make war upon the people of the\r\nPhilippines, nor upon any party or faction among them, but to protect\r\nthem in their homes, in their employments, and in their personal and\r\nreligious rights. All persons who, either by active aid or by honest\r\nsubmission, cooperate with the United States in its efforts to give\r\neffect to this beneficent purpose will receive the reward of its support\r\nand protection. Our occupation should be as free from severity as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThough the powers of the military occupant are absolute and supreme and\r\nimmediately operate upon the political condition of the inhabitants, the\r\nmunicipal laws of the conquered territory, such as affect private rights\r\nof person and property and provide for the punishment of crime, are\r\nconsidered as continuing in force, so far as they are compatible with\r\nthe new order of things, until they are suspended or superseded by the\r\noccupying belligerent; and in practice they are not usually abrogated,\r\nbut are allowed to remain in force and to be administered by the\r\nordinary tribunals substantially as they were before the occupation.\r\nThis enlightened practice is, so far as possible, to be adhered to on\r\nthe present occasion. The judges and the other officials connected with\r\nthe administration of justice may, if they accept the authority of the\r\nUnited States, continue to administer the ordinary law of the land as\r\nbetween man and man under the supervision of the American commander\r\nin chief. The native constabulary will, so far as may be practicable,\r\nbe preserved. The freedom of the people to pursue their accustomed\r\noccupations will be abridged only when it may be necessary to do so.\r\n\r\nWhile the rule of conduct of the American commander in chief will be\r\nsuch as has just been defined, it will be his duty to adopt measures\r\nof a different kind if, unfortunately, the course of the people should\r\nrender such measures indispensable to the maintenance of law and order.\r\nHe will then possess the power to replace or expel the native officials\r\nin part or altogether, to substitute new courts of his own constitution\r\nfor those that now exist, or to create such new or supplementary\r\ntribunals as may be necessary. In the exercise of these high powers the\r\ncommander must be guided by his judgment and his experience and a high\r\nsense of justice.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important and most practical problems with which the\r\ncommander of the expedition will have to deal is that of the treatment\r\nof property and the collection and administration of the revenues.\r\nIt is conceded that all public funds and securities belonging to the\r\ngovernment of the country in its own right and all arms and supplies and\r\nother movable property of such government may be seized by the military\r\noccupant and converted to the use of this Government. The real property\r\nof the state he may hold and administer, at the same time enjoying\r\nthe revenues thereof; but he is not to destroy it save in the case\r\nof military necessity. All public means of transportation, such as\r\ntelegraph lines, cables, railways, and boats belonging to the state may\r\nbe appropriated to his use, but unless in case of military necessity\r\nthey are not to be destroyed. All churches and buildings devoted to\r\nreligious worship and to the arts and sciences, all schoolhouses, are,\r\nso far as possible, to be protected, and all destruction or intentional\r\ndefacement of such places, of historical monuments or archives, or of\r\nworks of science or art is prohibited save when required by urgent\r\nmilitary necessity.\r\n\r\nPrivate property, whether belonging to individuals or corporations, is\r\nto be respected, and can be confiscated only as hereafter indicated.\r\nMeans of transportation, such as telegraph lines and cables, railways,\r\nand boats, may, although they belong to private individuals or\r\ncorporations, be seized by the military occupant, but unless destroyed\r\nunder military necessity are not to be retained.\r\n\r\nWhile it is held to be the right of a conqueror to levy contributions\r\nupon the enemy in their seaports, towns, or provinces which may be in\r\nhis military possession by conquest, and to apply the proceeds to defray\r\nthe expenses of the war, this right is to be exercised within such\r\nlimitations that it may not savor of confiscation. As the result of\r\nmilitary occupation the taxes and duties payable by the inhabitants to\r\nthe former government become payable to the military occupant, unless he\r\nsees fit to substitute for them other rates or modes of contribution to\r\nthe expenses of the government. The moneys so collected are to be used\r\nfor the purpose of paying the expenses of government under the military\r\noccupation, such as the salaries of the judges and the police, and for\r\nthe payment of the expenses of the army.\r\n\r\nPrivate property taken for the use of the army is to be paid for when\r\npossible in cash at a fair valuation, and when payment in cash is not\r\npossible receipts are to be given.\r\n\r\nIn order that there may be no conflict of authority between the army and\r\nthe navy in the administration of affairs in the Philippines, you are\r\ninstructed to confer with the Secretary of the Navy so far as necessary\r\nfor the purpose of devising measures to secure the harmonious action of\r\nthose, two branches of the public service.\r\n\r\nI will give instructions to the Secretary of the Treasury to make a\r\nreport to me upon the subject of the revenues of the Philippines, with a\r\nview to the formulation of such revenue measures as may seem expedient.\r\nAll ports and places in the Philippines which may be in the actual\r\npossession of our land and naval forces will be opened, while our\r\nmilitary occupation may continue, to the commerce of all neutral\r\nnations, as well as our own, in articles not contraband of war, and upon\r\npayment of the prescribed rates of duty which may be in force at the\r\ntime of the importation.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, May 19, 1898_.\r\n\r\nThe SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nSIR: The destruction of the Spanish fleet at Manila, followed by the\r\ntaking of the naval station at Cavite, the paroling of the garrisons,\r\nand the acquisition of the control of the bay, has rendered it\r\nnecessary, in the further prosecution of the measures adopted by this\r\nGovernment for the purpose of bringing about an honorable and durable\r\npeace with Spain, to send an army of occupation to the Philippines for\r\nthe twofold purpose of completing the reduction of the Spanish power in\r\nthat quarter and of giving to the islands order and security while in\r\nthe possession of the United States. For the command of this expedition\r\nI have designated Major-General Wesley Merritt, and it now becomes my\r\nduty to give instructions as to the manner in which the movement shall\r\nbe conducted.\r\n\r\nIt is held to be the right to levy contributions upon the enemy in all\r\nplaces which may be in military possession by conquest, and to apply\r\nthe proceeds to defray the cost of the war, including the expenses of\r\ngovernment during the military occupation. It is desirable, however,\r\nand in accordance with the views of modern civilization, to confine\r\nthe exercise of this power, so far as possible, to the collection of\r\nsuch contributions as are equivalent to the duties and taxes already\r\nestablished in the territory. I have determined to order that all ports\r\nor places in the Philippines which may be in the actual possession\r\nof our land and naval forces by conquest shall be opened, while our\r\nmilitary occupation may continue, to the commerce of all neutral\r\nnations, as well as our own, in articles not contraband of war, upon\r\npayment of the rates of duty which may be in force at the time when the\r\ngoods are imported. In the execution of this policy it may be advisable\r\nto substitute new rates of duty and new taxes for those now levied in\r\nthe Philippines. You are therefore instructed to examine the existing\r\nSpanish laws in relation to duties and taxes, and to report to me such\r\nrecommendations as you may deem it proper to make with respect either\r\nto the rates of duties and taxes or to the regulations which should be\r\nadopted for their imposition and collection.\r\n\r\nAs the levy of all contributions in territory occupied by a belligerent\r\nis a military right derived from the law of nations, the collection and\r\ndistribution of duties and taxes in the Philippines during the military\r\noccupation of the United States will be made, under the orders of the\r\nSecretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy, by the military or naval\r\ncommanders, as the case may be, of the ports or places which may be in\r\nthe possession of our forces. Your report is desired in order that I may\r\nbe able to give the proper directions to the Department of War and of\r\nthe Navy.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, May 19, 1898_.\r\n\r\nThe SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\r\n\r\nSIR: The destruction of the Spanish fleet at Manila, followed by the\r\ntaking of the naval station at Cavite, the paroling of the garrisons,\r\nand the acquisition of the control of the bay, has rendered it\r\nnecessary, in the further prosecution of the measures adopted by this\r\nGovernment for the purpose of bringing about an honorable and durable\r\npeace with Spain, to send an army of occupation to the Philippines for\r\nthe twofold purpose of completing the reduction of the Spanish power in\r\nthat quarter and of giving to the islands order and security while in\r\nthe possession of the United States. For the command of this expedition\r\nI have designated Major-General Wesley Merritt, and it now becomes my\r\nduty to give instructions as to the manner in which the movement shall\r\nbe conducted.\r\n\r\nI inclose herewith a copy of an order which I have this day addressed\r\nto the Secretary of War, setting forth the principles on which the\r\noccupation of the Philippines is to be carried out.[31] You are\r\ninstructed to confer with the Secretary of War in order that measures\r\nmay be devised by which any conflict of authority between the officers\r\nof our army and navy in the Philippines may be avoided.\r\n\r\nI have given instructions to the Secretary of the Treasury to examine\r\nthe subject of the duties and taxes imposed by Spain in the Philippines\r\nand to report to me any recommendations which he may deem it proper to\r\nmake in regard to the revenues of the islands.[32] I have informed him,\r\nhowever, that the collection and disbursement of the duties and taxes\r\ncollected there will, as a measure of military right derived from the\r\nlaw of nations, be made, under the orders of the Secretary of War and\r\nthe Secretary of the Navy, by our military or naval commanders, as the\r\ncase may be, at the ports or places which may be in possession of our\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: See pp. 208-211.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: See pp. 211-212.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, July 4, 1898._\r\n\r\n\r\nAdmiral SAMPSON,\r\n  _Playa del Este, Cuba_:\r\n\r\nYou have the gratitude and congratulations of the whole American people.\r\nConvey to your noble officers and crews, through whose valor new honors\r\nhave been added to the American Navy, the grateful thanks and\r\nappreciation of the nation.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE FOR THANKSGIVING AND PRAYER.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, July 6, 1898._\r\n\r\n_To the People of the United States of America_:\r\n\r\nAt this time, when to the yet fresh remembrance of the unprecedented\r\nsuccess which attended the operations of the United States fleet in the\r\nbay of Manila on the 1st day of May last are added the tidings of the no\r\nless glorious achievements of the naval and military arms of our beloved\r\ncountry at Santiago de Cuba, it is fitting that we should pause and,\r\nstaying the feeling of exultation that too naturally attends great deeds\r\nwrought by our countrymen in our country's cause, should reverently bow\r\nbefore the throne of divine grace and give devout praise to God, who\r\nholdeth the nations in the hollow of His hands and worketh upon them the\r\nmarvels of His high will, and who has thus far vouchsafed to us the\r\nlight of His face and led our brave soldiers and seamen to victory.\r\n\r\nI therefore ask the people of the United States, upon next assembling\r\nfor divine worship in their respective places of meeting, to offer\r\nthanksgiving to Almighty God, who in His inscrutable ways, now leading\r\nour hosts upon the waters to unscathed triumph; now guiding them in\r\na strange land, through the dread shadows of death, to success, even\r\nthough at a fearful cost; now bearing them, without accident or loss, to\r\nfar distant climes, has watched over our cause and brought nearer the\r\nsuccess of the right and the attainment of just and honorable peace.\r\n\r\nWith the nation's thanks let there be mingled the nation's prayers that\r\nour gallant sons may be shielded from harm alike on the battlefield and\r\nin the clash of fleets, and be spared the scourge of suffering and\r\ndisease while they are striving to uphold their country's honor; and\r\nwithal let the nation's heart be stilled with holy awe at the thought\r\nof the noble men who have perished as heroes die, and be filled with\r\ncompassionate sympathy for all those who suffer bereavement or endure\r\nsickness, wounds, and bonds by reason of the awful struggle. And above\r\nall, let us pray with earnest fervor that He, the Dispenser of All Good,\r\nmay speedily remove from us the untold afflictions of war and bring to\r\nour dear land the blessings of restored peace and to all the domain now\r\nravaged by the cruel strife the priceless boon of security and\r\ntranquillity.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _July 8, 1898_.\r\n\r\nGeneral SHAFTER,\r\n  _Playa, Cuba_:\r\n\r\nTelegram which it appears you did not receive read as follows:\r\n\r\nThe President directs me to say you have the gratitude and thanks of the\r\nnation for the brilliant and effective work of your noble army in the\r\nfight of July 1. The sturdy valor and heroism of officers and men fill\r\nthe American people with pride. The country mourns the brave men who\r\nfell in battle. They have added new names to our roll of heroes.\r\n\r\nR.A. ALGER, _Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, July 13,1898._\r\n\r\nThe SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nSIR: The capitulation of the Spanish forces in Santiago de Cuba and in\r\nthe eastern part of the Province of Santiago, and the occupation of the\r\nterritory by the forces of the United States, render it necessary to\r\ninstruct the military commander of the United States as to the conduct\r\nwhich he is to observe during the military occupation.\r\n\r\nThe first effect of the military occupation of the enemy's territory is\r\nthe severance of the former political relations of the inhabitants and\r\nthe establishment of a new political power. Under this changed condition\r\nof things the inhabitants, so long as they perform their duties, are\r\nentitled to security in their persons and property and in all their\r\nprivate rights and relations. It is my desire that the inhabitants of\r\nCuba should be acquainted with the purpose of the United States to\r\ndischarge to the fullest extent its obligations in this regard. It will\r\ntherefore be the duty of the commander of the army of occupation to\r\nannounce and proclaim in the most public manner that we come not to make\r\nwar upon the inhabitants of Cuba, nor upon any party or faction among\r\nthem, but to protect them in their homes, in their employments, and in\r\ntheir personal and religious rights. All persons who, either by active\r\naid or by honest submission, cooperate with the United States in its\r\nefforts to give effect to this beneficent purpose will receive the\r\nreward of its support and protection. Our occupation should be as free\r\nfrom severity as possible.\r\n\r\nThough the powers of the military occupant are absolute and supreme and\r\nimmediately operate upon the political condition of the inhabitants, the\r\nmunicipal laws of the conquered territory, such as affect private rights\r\nof person and property and provide for the punishment of crime, are\r\nconsidered as continuing in force, so far as they are compatible with\r\nthe new order of things, until they are suspended or superseded by the\r\noccupying belligerent; and in practice they are not usually abrogated,\r\nbut are allowed to remain in force and to be administered by the\r\nordinary tribunals substantially as they were before the occupation.\r\nThis enlightened practice is, so far as possible, to be adhered to on\r\nthe present occasion. The judges and the other officials connected with\r\nthe administration of justice may, if they accept the supremacy of the\r\nUnited States, continue to administer the ordinary law of the land as\r\nbetween man and man under the supervision of the American commander\r\nin chief. The native constabulary will, so far as may be practicable,\r\nbe preserved. The freedom of the people to pursue their accustomed\r\noccupations will be abridged only when it may be necessary to do so.\r\n\r\nWhile the rule of conduct of the American commander in chief will be\r\nsuch as has just been defined, it will be his duty to adopt measures\r\nof a different kind if, unfortunately, the course of the people should\r\nrender such measures indispensable to the maintenance of law and order.\r\nHe will then possess the power to replace or expel the native officials\r\nin part or altogether, to substitute new courts of his own constitution\r\nfor those that now exist, or to create such new or supplementary\r\ntribunals as may be necessary. In the exercise of these high powers the\r\ncommander must be guided by his judgment and his experience and a high\r\nsense of justice.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important and most practical problems with which it\r\nwill be necessary to deal is that of the treatment of property and the\r\ncollection and administration of the revenues. It is conceded that all\r\npublic funds and securities belonging to the government of the country\r\nin its own right and all arms and supplies and other movable property of\r\nsuch government may be seized by the military occupant and converted to\r\nhis own use. The real property of the state he may hold and administer,\r\nat the same time enjoying the revenues thereof; but he is not to destroy\r\nit save in the case of military necessity. All public means of\r\ntransportation, such as telegraph lines, cables, railways, and boats,\r\nbelonging to the state may be appropriated to his use, but unless in\r\ncase of military necessity they are not to be destroyed. All churches\r\nand buildings devoted to religious worship and to the arts and sciences,\r\nall schoolhouses, are, so far as possible, to be protected, and all\r\ndestruction or intentional defacement of such places, of historical\r\nmonuments or archives, or of works of science or art is prohibited\r\nsave when required by urgent military necessity.\r\n\r\nPrivate property, whether belonging to individuals or corporations,\r\nis to be respected, and can be confiscated only for cause. Means of\r\ntransportation, such as telegraph lines and cables, railways, and boats,\r\nmay, although they belong to private individuals or corporations, be\r\nseized by the military occupant, but unless destroyed under military\r\nnecessity are not to be retained.\r\n\r\nWhile it is held to be the right of the conqueror to levy contributions\r\nupon the enemy in their seaports, towns, or provinces which may be in\r\nhis military possession by conquest, and to apply the proceeds to defray\r\nthe expenses of the war, this right is to be exercised within such\r\nlimitations that it may not savor of confiscation.

Your splendid command has\r\nendured not only the hardships and sacrifices incident to campaign and\r\nbattle, but in stress of heat and weather has triumphed over obstacles\r\nwhich would have overcome men less brave and determined. One and all\r\nhave displayed the most conspicuous gallantry and earned the gratitude\r\nof the nation. The hearts of the people turn with tender sympathy to the\r\nsick and wounded. May the Father of Mercies protect and comfort them.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, July 21, 1898_.\r\n\r\nIn view of the occupation of Santiago de Cuba by the forces of the\r\nUnited States, it is ordered that postal communication between the\r\nUnited States and that port, which has been suspended since the opening\r\nof hostilities with Spain, may be resumed, subject to such military\r\nregulations as may be deemed necessary.\r\n\r\nAs other portions of the enemy's territory come into the possession of\r\nthe land and naval forces of the United States, postal communication may\r\nbe opened under the same conditions.\r\n\r\nThe domestic postal service within the territory thus occupied may be\r\ncontinued on the same principles already indicated for the continuance\r\nof the local municipal and judicial administration, and it maybe\r\nextended as the local requirements may justify, under the supervision of\r\nthe military commander.\r\n\r\nThe revenues derived from such service are to be applied to the expenses\r\nof conducting it, and the United States postage stamps are therefore to\r\nbe used.\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster-General is charged with the execution of this order in\r\ncooperation with the military commander, to whom the Secretary of War\r\nwill issue the necessary directions.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, August 6, 1898_.\r\n\r\n_Ordered_, That the graves of our soldiers at Santiago shall be\r\npermanently marked. The present marking will last but a short time, and\r\nbefore its effacement occurs suitable and permanent markers should be\r\nput up.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War is charged with the execution of this order.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, _Washington, August 17, 1898._\r\n\r\nMajor-General MERRITT,\r\n  _Manila, Philippines_:\r\n\r\nThe President directs that there must be no joint occupation with the\r\ninsurgents. The United States, in the possession of Manila City, Manila\r\nBay and Harbor, must preserve the peace and protect persons and property\r\nwithin the territory occupied by their military and naval forces.\r\nThe insurgents and all others must recognize the military occupation\r\nand authority of the United States and the cessation of hostilities\r\nproclaimed by the President. Use whatever means in your judgment are\r\nnecessary to this end. All law-abiding people must be treated alike.\r\n\r\nBy order Secretary War:\r\n\r\nH.C.

The President would be glad to have\r\nsuggestions from these commanders as to the government of the islands,\r\nwhich of necessity must be by the Army and the Navy for some time to\r\ncome. When these islands shall be ceded to us, it is his desire that\r\npeace and tranquillity shall be restored and as kind and beneficent a\r\ngovernment as possible given to the people, that they may be encouraged\r\nin their industries and made secure in life and property. The fullest\r\nsuggestions are invited.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 9, 1898_.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of the authority vested in me as Commander in Chief of the\r\nArmy and Navy of the United States, I hereby order and direct that\r\nduring the occupancy by the military authorities of the United States\r\nof the island of Cuba and all islands in the West Indies west of the\r\nseventy-fourth degree, west longitude, evacuated by Spain, said islands\r\nshall constitute a collection district for customs purposes. Havana\r\nshall be the chief port of entry. An officer of the Army shall be\r\nassigned to such port, who shall be the collector of customs of the\r\nislands and of the chief port and shall have general jurisdiction over\r\nthe collection of customs in the islands.\r\n\r\nThe ports of Matanzas, Cardenas, Cienfuegos, Sagua, Caibarien, Santiago,\r\nManzanillo, Nuevitas, Guantanamo, Gibara, and Baracoa, in said islands,\r\nare hereby declared to be subports of entry, and an officer of the Army\r\nwill be assigned to each of the subports, who will be the collector\r\nof customs of a subport and shall have general jurisdiction of the\r\ncollection of customs at such port. He shall make weekly reports to\r\nthe collector of customs of the islands at the chief port of all\r\ntransactions at the subport over which he has jurisdiction, with copies\r\nof all entries of merchandise, duly certified.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War shall appoint such civilian deputy collectors,\r\ninspectors, and other employees as may be found necessary.\r\n\r\nThe collectors of the subports shall deposit all moneys collected by\r\nthem with the collector of the islands, and a receipt from the collector\r\nof the islands must be taken in duplicate for all such deposits.\r\n\r\nThere shall be appointed an auditor, who shall be stationed at the chief\r\nport, whose duty it shall be to examine all entries of merchandise and\r\nif found correct to certify to them. Such auditor shall on the first\r\nof each month make a full and complete report, duly certified, to the\r\nSecretary of War of all duties collected at each port, with an itemized\r\nreport of all expenditures made therefrom, which shall be referred to\r\nthe Auditor for the War Department for audit.\r\n\r\nAll questions arising in the administration of customs in the islands\r\nshall be referred to the collector of the islands at the chief port for\r\ndecision, from which there shall be no appeal, except in such cases as\r\nmay be referred by the collector of the islands to the Secretary of War\r\nfor his decision.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, December 21, 1898_.\r\n\r\nThe SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nSIR: The destruction of the Spanish fleet in the harbor of Manila by the\r\nUnited States naval squadron commanded by Rear-Admiral Dewey, followed\r\nby the reduction of the city and the surrender of the Spanish forces,\r\npractically effected the conquest of the Philippine Islands and the\r\nsuspension of Spanish sovereignty therein.\r\n\r\nWith the signature of the treaty of peace between the United States\r\nand Spain by their respective plenipotentiaries at Paris, on the 10th\r\ninstant, and as the result of the victories of American arms, the future\r\ncontrol, disposition, and government of the Philippine Islands are ceded\r\nto the United States. In fulfillment of the rights of sovereignty thus\r\nacquired and the responsible obligations of government thus assumed,\r\nthe actual occupation and administration of the entire group of the\r\nPhilippine Islands become immediately necessary, and the military\r\ngovernment heretofore maintained by the United States in the city,\r\nharbor, and bay of Manila is to be extended with all possible dispatch\r\nto the whole of the ceded territory.\r\n\r\nIn performing this duty the military commander of the United States is\r\nenjoined to make known to the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands\r\nthat in succeeding to the sovereignty of Spain, in severing the former\r\npolitical relations of the inhabitants, and in establishing a new\r\npolitical power the authority of the United States is to be exerted for\r\nthe security of the persons and property of the people of the islands\r\nand for the confirmation of all their private rights and relations.\r\n\r\nIt will be the duty of the commander of the forces of occupation to\r\nannounce and proclaim in the most public manner that we come, not as\r\ninvaders or conquerors, but as friends, to protect the natives in\r\ntheir homes, in their employments, and in their personal and religious\r\nrights. All persons who, either by active aid or by honest submission,\r\ncooperate with the Government of the United States to give effect to\r\nthese beneficent purposes will receive the reward of its support and\r\nprotection. All others will be brought within the lawful rule we have\r\nassumed, with firmness if need be, but without severity so far as may\r\nbe possible.\r\n\r\nWithin the absolute domain of military authority, which necessarily is\r\nand must remain supreme in the ceded territory until the legislation of\r\nthe United States shall otherwise provide, the municipal laws of the\r\nterritory in respect to private rights and property and the repression\r\nof crime are to be considered as continuing in force and to be\r\nadministered by the ordinary tribunals so far as practicable. The\r\noperations of civil and municipal government are to be performed by such\r\nofficers as may accept the supremacy of the United States by taking the\r\noath of allegiance, or by officers chosen as far as may be practicable\r\nfrom the inhabitants of the islands.\r\n\r\nWhile the control of all the public property and the revenues of the\r\nstate passes with the cession, and while the use and management of all\r\npublic means of transportation are necessarily reserved to the authority\r\nof the United States, private property, whether belonging to individuals\r\nor corporations, is to be respected, except for cause duly established.\r\nThe taxes and duties heretofore payable by the inhabitants to the late\r\ngovernment become payable to the authorities of the United States,\r\nunless it be seen fit to substitute for them other reasonable rates or\r\nmodes of contribution to the expenses of government, whether general or\r\nlocal. If private property be taken for military use, it shall be paid\r\nfor when possible in cash at a fair valuation, and when payment in cash\r\nis not practicable receipts are to be given.\r\n\r\nAll ports and places in the Philippine Islands in the actual possession\r\nof the land and naval forces of the United States will be opened to the\r\ncommerce of all friendly nations. All goods and wares not prohibited for\r\nmilitary reasons, by due announcement of the military authority, will be\r\nadmitted upon payment of such duties and other charges as shall be in\r\nforce at the time of their importation.\r\n\r\nFinally, it should be the earnest and paramount aim of the military\r\nadministration to win the confidence, respect, and affection of the\r\ninhabitants of the Philippines by assuring to them in every possible\r\nway that full measure of individual rights and liberties which is the\r\nheritage of free peoples, and by proving to them that the mission of the\r\nUnited States is one of benevolent assimilation, substituting the mild\r\nsway of justice and right for arbitrary rule. In the fulfillment of this\r\nhigh mission, supporting the temperate administration of affairs for the\r\ngreatest good of the governed, there must be sedulously maintained the\r\nstrong arm of authority to repress disturbance and to overcome all\r\nobstacles to the bestowal of the blessings of good and stable government\r\nupon the people of the Philippine Islands under the free flag of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, _Washington, December 21, 1898_.\r\n\r\nGeneral OTIS,\r\n  _Manila_:\r\n\r\nAnswering your message of December 14, the President directs that you\r\nsend necessary troops to Iloilo to preserve the peace and protect life\r\nand property. It is most important that there should be no conflict with\r\nthe insurgents. Be conciliatory, but firm.\r\n\r\nBy order of the Secretary War:\r\n\r\nCORBIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, December 22, 1898_.\r\n\r\nUntil otherwise ordered no grants or concessions of public or corporate\r\nrights or franchises for the construction of public or _quasi_\r\npublic works, such as railroads, tramways, telegraph and telephone\r\nlines, water works, gas works, electric-light lines, etc., shall be made\r\nby any municipal or other local governmental authority or body in Cuba,\r\nexcept upon the approval of the major-general commanding the military\r\nforces of the United States in Cuba, who shall before approving any such\r\ngrant or concession be so especially authorized by the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n[Similar orders applying to Puerto Rico and to the Philippines were\r\nissued.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, December 22, 1898_.\r\n\r\nThe SECRETARY OF WAR:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe major-general commanding the United States forces in Cuba and the\r\nsenior naval officer of the American fleet in the port of Havana are\r\ndirected to observe such arrangements and ceremonies for the evacuation\r\nof Havana, to take place on January 1, 1899, as may be communicated to\r\nthem by the United States commissioners on evacuation. They will aid\r\nin carrying out such arrangements.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, _Washington, January 1, 1899--4.30 p.m._\r\n\r\nGeneral OTIS,\r\n  _Manila_:\r\n\r\nThe President considers it of first importance that a conflict brought\r\non by you be avoided at this time, if possible. Can not Miller get into\r\ncommunication with insurgents, giving them President's proclamation and\r\ninforming them of the purposes of the Government, assuring them that\r\nwhile it will assert its sovereignty its purpose is to give them a good\r\ngovernment and security in their personal rights.\r\n\r\nBy order Secretary War:\r\n\r\nCORBIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, January 20, 1899._\r\n\r\nThe SECRETARY OF STATE:\r\n\r\nMy communication to the Secretary of War dated December 21, 1898,[33]\r\ndeclares the necessity of extending the actual occupation and\r\nadministration of the city, harbor, and bay of Manila to the whole of\r\nthe territory which by the treaty of Paris, signed on December 10, 1898,\r\npassed from the sovereignty of Spain to the sovereignty of the United\r\nStates and the consequent establishment of military government\r\nthroughout the entire group of the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nWhile the treaty has not yet been ratified, it is believed that it will\r\nbe by the time of the arrival at Manila of the commissioners named\r\nbelow. In order to facilitate the most humane, specific, and effective\r\nextension of authority throughout these islands and to secure with the\r\nleast possible delay the benefits of a wise and generous protection of\r\nlife and property to the inhabitants, I have named Jacob G. Schurman,\r\nRear-Admiral George Dewey, Major-General Elwell S. Otis, Charles Denby,\r\nand Dean C. Worcester to constitute a commission to aid in the\r\naccomplishment of these results.\r\n\r\nIn the performance of this duty the commissioners are enjoined to meet\r\nat the earliest possible day in the city of Manila and to announce by a\r\npublic proclamation their presence and the mission intrusted to them,\r\ncarefully setting forth that while the military government already\r\nproclaimed is to be maintained and continued so long as necessity may\r\nrequire, efforts will be made to alleviate the burdens of taxation, to\r\nestablish industrial and commercial prosperity, and to provide for the\r\nsafety of persons and of property by such means as may be found\r\nconducive to these ends.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners will endeavor, without interference with the military\r\nauthorities of the United States now in control of the Philippines, to\r\nascertain what amelioration in the condition of the inhabitants and what\r\nimprovements in public order may be practicable, and for this purpose\r\nthey will study attentively the existing social and political state of\r\nthe various populations, particularly as regards the forms of local\r\ngovernment, the administration of justice, the collection of customs\r\nand other taxes, the means of transportation, and the need of public\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nThey will report through the State Department, according to the forms\r\ncustomary or hereafter prescribed for transmitting and preserving such\r\ncommunications, the results of their observations and reflections, and\r\nwill recommend such executive action as may from time to time seem to\r\nthem wise and useful.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners are hereby authorized to confer authoritatively\r\nwith any persons resident in the islands from whom they may believe\r\nthemselves able to derive information or suggestions valuable for the\r\npurposes of their commission, or whom they may choose to employ as\r\nagents, as may be necessary for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe temporary government of the islands is intrusted to the military\r\nauthorities, as already provided for by my instructions to the Secretary\r\nof War of December 21, 1898,[34] and will continue until Congress shall\r\ndetermine otherwise. The commission may render valuable services by\r\nexamining with special care the legislative needs of the various groups\r\nof inhabitants and by reporting, with recommendations, the measures\r\nwhich should be instituted for the maintenance of order, peace, and\r\npublic welfare, either as temporary steps to be taken immediately for\r\nthe perfection of present administration or as suggestions for future\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nIn so far as immediate personal changes in the civil administration may\r\nseem to be advisable, the commissioners are empowered to recommend\r\nsuitable persons for appointment to these offices from among the\r\ninhabitants of the islands who have previously acknowledged their\r\nallegiance to this Government.\r\n\r\nIt is my desire that in all their relations with the inhabitants of\r\nthe islands the commissioners exercise due respect for all the ideals,\r\ncustoms, and institutions of the tribes and races which compose the\r\npopulation, emphasizing upon all occasions the just and beneficent\r\nintentions of the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is also my wish and expectation that the commissioners may be\r\nreceived in a manner due to the honored and authorized representatives\r\nof the American Republic, duly commissioned, on account of their\r\nknowledge, skill, and integrity, as bearers of the good will, the\r\nprotection, and the richest blessings of a liberating rather than\r\na conquering nation.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM McKINLEY.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: See pp. 219-221.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: See pp. 219-221.]",
