As such it is respectfully submitted\r\nto the thinking Public. The Author considers it advisable to state\r\nthat he has no commercial interests in West Africa, and is, therefore,\r\nuninfluenced by considerations of a personal nature, in emphasising\r\nthe importance of the part played by the merchant on the West African\r\nstage. He also deems it right to say that the West African Section of\r\nthe Liverpool Chamber of Commerce is neither responsible nor answerable\r\nfor the opinions expressed herein. The Author hereby acknowledges the\r\ncourtesy of the Editor of the _Pall Mall Gazette_, the Editor-Proprietor\r\nof _West Africa_, the Editor of the _Contemporary Review_, and the\r\nEditorial Committee of the _Journal of the African Society_, in\r\npermitting the incorporation of certain matter contributed by himself,\r\nfrom time to time, to those publications. His sincere thanks are due to\r\nMajor Ronald Ross, F.R.C.S., F.R.S., C.B., for the chapter which that\r\ndistinguished scientist has specially written at the Author’s request. To\r\nother kind friends and acquaintances who have good-humouredly submitted\r\nto cross-examination, and have allowed themselves to be victimised by the\r\nAuthor’s importunities generally, grateful appreciation is due, and is\r\nthankfully acknowledged.\r\n\r\n    HAWARDEN, 1902.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAP.

One of her greatest admirers\r\nto whom I was expressing the other day much the same feeling, expressed\r\na different view. “Miss Kingsley’s work was done”—he said in effect—“she\r\nwas the pioneer, she showed the way. That was her allotted task: the\r\nfruit of her labours will come in due season.” It may be so. Indeed,\r\nwhen we think of what Mary Kingsley accomplished in the few short years\r\nwhich she devoted to West Africa, the thought arises whether there is\r\nnot an element of unconscious selfishness in the desire that she might\r\nhave been spared. The nature of the work she had undertaken, the intense\r\nfervour with which she devoted herself body and soul to preaching the\r\nmorals it was given her to inculcate, the utter brain weariness which at\r\ntimes she was fain to admit—no mortal being could have endured for very\r\nlong so perpetual a mental and physical strain. It was a passing heavy\r\nload for a weak woman of indifferent health to bear, and in death Mary\r\nKingsley has perhaps achieved a greater triumph, a success more striking\r\nand profound, than living on she would have attained. Death has had the\r\neffect of rapidly fertilising the seeds she sowed, and from her ashes\r\nhave sprung forces gathering daily in power which, united in a common\r\naim, are taking up her burden and carrying it along the path she pointed\r\nout, assured that every year will bring fresh helpers, be the obstacles\r\never so great. _La verité est en marche_, and although the spirit of\r\nthe hour is not precisely favourable to that patient investigation of\r\nWest African problems which affords the only guarantee of political and\r\nadministrative success, the phase is but a fleeting one, and when the\r\npresent fashionable policy of force and hurry is found by practical tests\r\nto be even more sterile in useful results than the apathy which preceded\r\nit, the main truths Mary Kingsley taught will appeal to thinking men with\r\nan eloquence all the greater for having been temporarily obscured.\r\n\r\nOn the personal aspect of Mary Kingsley’s character one would fain dwell\r\nat length. Few women, I believe, have inspired all sorts and conditions\r\nof men with so intense a respect, so wondering an admiration. Few women\r\nare able, as Mary Kingsley was able, to draw forth, by the magic of\r\nher earnest personality, the best in a man. She was so unassuming, so\r\nunaffected, such a womanly woman in every sense of the word, that it\r\nappeared almost incredible she should have grasped the essentialities\r\nof West African politics with such comprehensiveness and scientific\r\nperception; mastered, as no one had done before—in the sense, at any\r\nrate, of being able to impart the knowledge to the world—the intricacies\r\nof native custom and native law, or have affronted the physical\r\nperils she made so light of. Eminent politicians and administrators,\r\ndistinguished men of letters, world-renowned scientists, commercial\r\nmagnates, were regular visitors at her modest residence, and one and\r\nall drew from her inexhaustible store. The least of those to whom she\r\nextended the privilege of her friendship were always welcome, and\r\nnever failed to leave her presence without feeling that her words of\r\nsympathy and encouragement were a fresh incentive to push onward, never\r\nlosing hope and fortified against disappointment. The truest, kindest,\r\nstaunchest friend that ever breathed—such was Mary Kingsley; and we who\r\nknew her, and have lost her, know also that something has gone out of our\r\nlives which can never be replaced. In a passage of singular beauty, Mrs.\r\nAlice Stopford Green thus closes a tribute[1] to the dead friend whose\r\nwork she herself is doing so much to carry on: “She laid her armour down\r\nwhen she asked to be carried out to the unfathomable Ocean, alone in\r\ndeath as she had been alone in life, going out with her last wish from\r\nthe bitter strife of men to the immensities where she sought the will of\r\nGod.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nFIVE YEARS OF BRITISH TRADE WITH WESTERN AFRICA\r\n\r\n    “West Africa, that great feeding-ground for British\r\n    manufactures.”—MARY KINGSLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne still—but too often, alas!—meets with people who wonder why England\r\nshould bother about West Africa at all, and pooh-pooh the idea that we\r\nhave interests there at the present time worth looking after, while as\r\nfor the future possibilities of that huge country as a field for British\r\nenterprise, they simply will not trouble themselves to give the matter a\r\nmoment’s consideration.\r\n\r\nNow figures are very uninteresting things, no doubt, to the average\r\nreader; but they possess a practical significance superior to any number\r\nof the most glowing dissertations, and I trust my readers will forgive me\r\nif I make, as a basis of justification for inflicting this volume upon\r\nthem, a few sets of figures which I would respectfully suggest as worthy\r\nof their attentive consideration. The statistics are compiled from the\r\nCustom House returns, and they show the extent, nature and distribution\r\nof British trade in Western Africa during the last few years. In perusing\r\nthem, three facts should be borne in mind: first, that, although\r\nEuropeans have been engaged in commercial transactions on the West\r\nCoast for upwards of five hundred and fifty years, those transactions\r\nwere, prior to the abolition of the over-sea slave trade, confined,\r\nwith very few exceptions[2]—so far as the exports from West Africa were\r\nconcerned—to the human cargo, and to gold dust and ivory: that the trade\r\nin palm oil and kernels, which are now the staple articles of export\r\nfrom West Africa, is therefore of comparatively recent growth, and that\r\nthe mahogany trade and the rubber trade have only come into existence—to\r\nany appreciable extent—within the last few years, a fair indication\r\nof the fertility and producing power and almost boundless resources\r\nof West Africa. Secondly, that the extensive business relationship\r\nwhich has been built up between Great Britain and West Africa, in the\r\nshape of a legitimate commerce, has grown to its present proportions\r\nunder circumstances absolutely disadvantageous to development, without\r\nrailways, with but few roads, with intertribal wars often preventing\r\nthe circulation of trade for months at a time, by merely scratching the\r\nsurface of the most prolific region in the world. Thirdly, that the\r\nfigures given below do but show the actual volume of Britain’s trade with\r\nWest Africa and the wages earned by thousands of English men and women\r\nwho directly and indirectly benefit by that trade; the British capital\r\ninvested in West Africa in factories, machinery, craft for navigating the\r\nrivers, coaling depôts, surf-boats and lighters, stores and the like, to\r\nwhich must now be added railway material, dredging apparatus, batteries\r\nand soon, we may hope, cotton gins, not to mention a fleet of some sixty\r\nsteamers employed in the carrying trade and passenger traffic—all these\r\nthings have to be taken into account in estimating West Africa’s worth to\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nThe total values of British produce and manufactures[3] shipped to the\r\n_British possessions in West Africa_ in the five years 1896-1900 were\r\nrespectively as follows:\r\n\r\n    1896              £1,828,395\r\n    1897               1,763,461\r\n    1898               1,999,505\r\n    1899               2,116,080\r\n    1900               2,148,149\r\n                      ----------\r\n         Gross total  £9,855,590\r\n\r\nPercentage of increase in five years, 17½ per cent.\r\n\r\nThe total values of British produce and manufactures shipped to the\r\n_possessions of Foreign Powers_ in West Africa in the five years\r\n1896-1900 were respectively as follows:\r\n\r\n    1896                £970,080\r\n    1897               1,002,318\r\n    1898               1,247,994\r\n    1899               1,490,603\r\n    1900               2,145,349\r\n                      ----------\r\n         Gross total  £6,856,344\r\n\r\nPercentage of increase in five years, 121 per cent.\r\n\r\nIf we add these two totals together, we find that the value of British\r\nproduce and manufactures shipped to _West Africa_ in the period mentioned\r\nwas £16,711,934, which is a percentage of increase of 138 per cent.\r\n\r\nFrom the British export trade we turn to the British import trade with\r\nWest Africa.\r\n\r\nThe total values of raw produce imported by Great Britain _from British\r\nWest Africa_ in the five years 1896-1900 were respectively as follows:\r\n\r\n    1896              £2,223,925\r\n    1897               2,153,412\r\n    1898               2,352,285\r\n    1899               2,427,946\r\n    1900               2,137,023\r\n                     -----------\r\n        Gross total  £11,294,591\r\n\r\nThe total values of raw produce imported by Great Britain from the\r\n_possessions of Foreign Powers_ in West Africa in the five years\r\n1896-1900 were respectively as follows:\r\n\r\n    1896                £333,803\r\n    1897                 553,130\r\n    1898                 622,287\r\n    1899                 651,043\r\n    1900                 806,077\r\n                      ----------\r\n         Gross total  £2,966,340\r\n\r\nThese two totals added together show that Great Britain imported West\r\nAfrican produce in the period under review to the amount of £14,260,931.\r\n\r\nThe value of Great Britain’s direct commerce with West Africa in the five\r\nyears 1896-1900 was, therefore, £30,972,865. To this might be added a\r\nfurther sum of £1,750,888, representing foreign and colonial merchandise\r\nshipped to West Africa from British ports in the years mentioned.[4]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting, and valuable, to see which, among the possessions of\r\nForeign Powers in West Africa, were the chief absorbers of British goods\r\nand the chief exporters of raw produce to Great Britain. Examination\r\nyields the following knowledge:\r\n\r\nPrincipal possessions of Foreign Powers which absorbed in five years\r\n£6,856,344 of British goods:[5]\r\n\r\n            French.   Portuguese.   German.   Others.\r\n               £           £           £         £\r\n    1896    348,258     402,445      68,355   151,022\r\n    1897    401,224     360,121      91,320   149,653\r\n    1898    531,848     438,320     109,580   178,246\r\n    1899    693,255     503,788     126,047   167,513\r\n    1900    709,900   1,084,072[6]  120,910   212,175\r\n\r\nPrincipal possessions of Foreign Powers which exported to Great Britain\r\nin five years £2,966,340 of raw produce:\r\n\r\n            French.   Portuguese.   German.   Others.\r\n               £           £           £         £\r\n    1896    203,442      33,937      42,001    54,423\r\n    1897    312,430     116,554      68,194    55,952\r\n    1898    431,192      85,544      35,165    70,186\r\n    1899    461,267      68,021      48,736    73,019\r\n    1900    534,727      75,037      94,681   101,632\r\n\r\nThe French possessions are, it will be observed, far and away our\r\nprincipal markets and our principal suppliers among the possessions of\r\nForeign Powers. Our exports to and imports from the French possessions\r\namounted together to £4,627,543, or just under 50 per cent. of our total\r\nexport and import trade with the possessions of Foreign Powers together.\r\nThe increasing importance of the French possessions in West Africa as a\r\nmarket for the sale of British goods and as suppliers of British home\r\nmarkets is a fact which it is of the utmost consequence for British\r\nstatesmen to lay to heart. The subject is one which I shall refer to\r\nlater on. It is already one of the dominant factors of West African\r\npolitics affecting Great Britain, and is destined to become so more\r\nand more as the years go on, for France is in a territorial sense the\r\nmistress of West Africa, and may become so in a commercial sense as well.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusions to be drawn from a study of these figures are\r\nvarious. First and foremost there is the clearly established fact\r\nthat British trade with West Africa is expanding enormously and has\r\nalmost unlimited prospects before it, now that serious and concentrated\r\nefforts are being made on all sides to open up the untapped wealth of\r\nthe interior by the means of roads and railways and by the improvement\r\nof navigable waterways, while the cessation of intertribal warfare in\r\nmany districts must entail a large increase in the population, and\r\ntherefore, in the native capacity for production and purchase. It is\r\nalso demonstrated that every year West Africa absorbs a larger quantity\r\nof British manufactured goods: that the exports of British manufactured\r\ngoods are steadily increasing to British West Africa and increasing to an\r\nextraordinary degree to the possessions of Foreign Powers in West Africa,\r\nespecially to the French possessions: that Great Britain is consolidating\r\nher hold upon the carrying trade of West Africa as testified by the\r\nincreased quantity of foreign and colonial manufactures shipped to West\r\nAfrica from British ports: that the Continent—Germany[7] chiefly—is\r\nreceiving a greater amount of raw produce from the British possessions in\r\nWest Africa, a deduction which can be fairly drawn from the stationary\r\naspect of the importation by Great Britain of such produce from her own\r\nWest African possessions. And the final conclusion is this, that, in\r\nview of the restricted extent of the British possessions in West Africa,\r\ncompared with the possessions of Foreign Powers in that part of the\r\nworld, the latter offer a very much vaster field for the sale of British\r\ngoods. Consequently, it is the bounden duty of the British Government\r\nand the British Chambers of Commerce, while in no way neglecting the\r\nbrilliant possibilities which the British West African possessions offer\r\nunder wise administration for the enterprise of Englishmen, to be ever\r\non the alert to look to the future and to protect British trade with the\r\npossessions of the Foreign Powers in West Africa against legislation\r\ntending to close the door of those possessions against it; and to insist\r\nthat, whenever international treaties guaranteeing freedom of trade to\r\nthe subjects of all nations exist in West Africa, they shall be rigidly\r\nadhered to by the signatories. In this respect British diplomacy has\r\nshown itself singularly lax. But the mischief already committed may\r\neven yet be remedied, and further dangers which loom ahead averted, if\r\nthe British public will only realise before it is too late the enormous\r\nissues at stake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE OLD AND THE NEW\r\n\r\n    “The past has gone with its follies and its waste.... Let us\r\n    then face the present and contemplate the future.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the previous chapter we discussed in practical fashion the grounds\r\nupon which the British public is called upon to devote more attention\r\nto the affairs of West Africa than it does at present, and an attempt—I\r\nhope a successful attempt—was made to show how very short-sighted and\r\nsingularly misinformed is the opinion which would disinterest itself from\r\na part of the world where the possibilities of commercial development\r\nare so strikingly manifest. There has never been such urgent need for\r\nan intelligent appreciation, on the part of the British public, of the\r\nproblems which confront this country in West Africa. In a few short years\r\nthe policy of Great Britain in West Africa has undergone a complete\r\nchange. Events have followed one another with bewildering rapidity.\r\nOfficial indifference has been galvanised into life by French activity,\r\nand after a brief but dangerous period of international rivalry, British\r\npolitical rights have been established over a considerable extent of\r\nterritory, not, however, nearly so considerable as a pacific, consistent,\r\nwell-thought-out programme adopted some years previously would have\r\nbrought, had our merchant-pioneers been listened to, and had successive\r\nGovernments been able to throw off the paralysing influence of the\r\nresolution of 1865. There is a story told of a certain Minister in charge\r\nof the Foreign Office—it was related to me by one of those present at the\r\ninterview—which illustrates very forcibly the feeling which prevailed in\r\nGovernment circles in those days. A deputation of merchants waited upon\r\nhis Excellency with the request that he would permit the hoisting of the\r\nUnion Jack on certain parts of the West African littoral where British\r\nmerchants had long been trading, and where the rulers of the country\r\nwere genuinely desirous of receiving a British protectorate. _Pro-formâ_\r\ntreaties were produced by the deputation between these rulers and the\r\nresident merchants. The merchants asked for no reward. There was no\r\nquestion of expenditure involved. All that the Government was required\r\nto do was to meet the wishes of the chiefs. The deputation pointed out\r\nthat, so far as the relations between the natives and the commercial\r\nrepresentatives of Great Britain were concerned, the acceptance of the\r\nGovernment would in no wise alter them, but would simply have the effect\r\nof cementing a friendly understanding which already existed. But, urged\r\nthe deputation, the treaties, if agreed to by the Government, would prove\r\nan invaluable diplomatic instrument if the time came, as it seemed likely\r\nto do, when England might find herself faced in West Africa by foreign\r\ncompetition. The Minister flung the treaties across the table.\r\n\r\nIt was a time of wasted opportunities, when a little political foresight\r\nwould have conferred upon this country great future benefit, and it seems\r\nextraordinary, but is unhappily true, that the same failure to look ahead\r\nas regards West Africa appears to afflict our Foreign Office to-day\r\ndespite the lessons of the past. Of this, more anon.\r\n\r\nBut if successive Governments showed unpardonable negligence in\r\nsafeguarding British interests in West Africa, for decade after decade,\r\ndown to the very time when the French had worked their way so far\r\nsouthward into the natural _hinterlands_ of our old Colonies that action\r\nbecame imperative if anything was to be saved from the wreck, the British\r\npress and public were greatly to blame also. I well remember that at the\r\nvery height of the recent Anglo-French controversy which culminated in\r\nthe Convention of 1898, when rival English and French expeditions were\r\nrushing hither and thither through the territories west of the Niger,\r\nand when British and French efforts were concentrated upon wringing\r\nout of the unfortunate Borgu Chiefs all sorts, kinds, and conditions\r\nof agreements, sowing Union Jacks and Tricolors by the wayside, the\r\nwell-known editor of an equally well-known newspaper to which I then\r\ncontributed, asked me to show him Nikki[8] on the map, as he had not the\r\nleast idea where it was.\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain came into power just at the moment when French enterprise\r\nin the West African uplands had reached its maximum of threatening\r\nintensity, and he set himself to vigorously counteract it as far as he\r\ncould. The invertebrate policy had, however, compromised the situation\r\nalmost beyond remedy, and had it not been for Mr. Joseph Thomson’s\r\nsuccess in obtaining treaty rights with the Emirs of Sokoto and Bornu in\r\n1884 on behalf of the National African Company of Merchants—subsequently\r\nthe Royal Niger Company—and, it may be added, for the loyal adherence\r\nof those native States to the treaties passed with the Company, the\r\nmagnificent possession of Northern Nigeria would have gone the way of\r\nFuta Jallon, of Mossi, and of so many other countries lying at the back\r\nof our Colonies; that is to say, would have fallen into French hands.\r\nThe man who deserves the most credit for saving Northern Nigeria to the\r\nEmpire is Sir George Taubman Goldie, and however one may deplore some\r\nof the uses to which he put his Charter—things we are paying for now\r\nin the French Congo and elsewhere—it is but common fairness to assert\r\nthat, if it had not been for Sir George Goldie, the possessions of Great\r\nBritain in West Africa would have been reduced by about one half. It is\r\na matter for some surprise that the Government should not have succeeded\r\nin securing the continuation of Sir George Goldie’s co-operation in West\r\nAfrica after the Royal Niger Company’s Charter was cancelled. An old\r\nopponent has lately said of him that “there is no one more competent\r\nto guide our West African Administration on practical, humanitarian,\r\neconomical, prudent, and statesmanlike lines, no one more fitted to take\r\na high position in West African affairs political and commercial,” a\r\nstatement which will meet with wide acceptance.\r\n\r\nBut this, after all, is ancient history, and what we are chiefly\r\nconcerned with now, is the present. What we are called upon to seriously\r\nconsider is the general trend of England’s policy in West Africa,\r\nadministrative, financial, political and commercial. Internationally,\r\nwe are secure in the possession of our territories. The only rivalry we\r\nhave to fear is the peaceful rivalry of commerce, but commerce is the\r\nexplanation of our presence in West Africa: it constitutes the sinews of\r\nour administration, and its requirements demand the constant vigilance,\r\nthe most careful attention of the official world.\r\n\r\nIt is the bounden duty of those who, believing in the immense importance\r\nof West Africa to Great Britain, and similarly believing that the present\r\npolicy which is being pursued by Great Britain in West Africa is open on\r\nseveral grounds to grave objection, to say so, and to give their reasons\r\nfor saying so, with the assured conviction that, however unpopular their\r\narguments may be, the general interest demands that they should be put\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE REAL AND THE IDEAL\r\n\r\n    “The nature of the natives, the climate, everything is against\r\n    precipitate and hasty action. To advance slowly, leaving no\r\n    bad or unfinished work behind, to gain the respect and liking\r\n    of the natives, and only to use force when compelled as a last\r\n    resource to do so, are the means which in my humble opinion\r\n    lead to success in West Africa. To quote from the words of a\r\n    celebrated French traveller: ‘Do not let us dream of a hasty\r\n    transformation of Africa. Let us employ a method, slow but\r\n    sure. Let us try and teach the natives what knowledge we have\r\n    acquired, and not try and make them learn in a few years\r\n    what it has taken us twenty centuries to learn.’”—SIR CLAUDE\r\n    MACDONALD in Liverpool, 1892.\r\n\r\n    “These figures are surprising. One would naturally have\r\n    expected that as the trade increased the proportion of\r\n    expenditure would have decreased.... From that date, however,\r\n    the expenditure has advanced by leaps and bounds, and in 1900\r\n    amounted to 28 per cent. of the exports. In other words, the\r\n    expenditure has increased more rapidly than the trade....\r\n    If, however, the expenditure had been on the basis of former\r\n    years ... we could have given over £1,000,000 worth additional\r\n    European goods in exchange for the same amount of produce. In\r\n    other words, the heavier the expenditure the higher price must\r\n    the merchant ask for his European goods, or the less he is able\r\n    to give for native produce. This must have the double effect\r\n    of reducing the demand for manufactures and diminishing the\r\n    energy of the natives in gathering produce. There is another\r\n    possibility which should not be lost sight of: our colonies\r\n    are hemmed in by our French and German neighbours. If in\r\n    consequence of increased expenditure and the resulting heavier\r\n    taxes we are unable to offer the natives as large a quantity of\r\n    manufactures and as good a price as our competitors are enabled\r\n    to do, produce which is grown on the borders of our Colonies\r\n    may be diverted to foreign territory with a consequent loss of\r\n    trade to this country.”—Mr. ARTHUR HUTTON, President African\r\n    Section, Manchester Chamber of Commerce.[9]\r\n\r\n\r\nA wise man has said that there is no way of conveying a rebuke so\r\nefficiently as upon the back of a compliment, and as a preliminary\r\nto criticism of certain phases of British administration in West\r\nAfrica, a measure of praise is both just and needful. To avoid\r\npersonalities—whether in the sense of praise or otherwise—should be\r\nthe constant endeavour of any critic in approaching the subject under\r\ndiscussion, because it is primarily the system, and not the agents of\r\nthe system, which is in question. Unfortunately the Crown Colony system\r\nbeing what it is, a despotism—though by no means necessarily a tyrannical\r\ndespotism—there is great difficulty, if not actual impossibility, in\r\naltogether avoiding the personal equation.\r\n\r\nThe revolution in British West African policy is indelibly associated\r\nwith the advent to power of the present Colonial Secretary, the\r\nRight Honourable Joseph Chamberlain. His entry upon the scene was\r\ncontemporaneous with the culmination of certain events which must\r\ninfallibly have modified our previous attitude in relation to West Africa\r\nwhoever the statesmen responsible at the time might have been. The point\r\nneed not be laboured, but it is often overlooked. Be that as it may,\r\nit is an undoubted fact—a fact redounding greatly to Mr. Chamberlain’s\r\ncredit—that no Colonial Secretary before him has displayed so lively and\r\npersonal an interest, both publicly and privately, in the affairs of\r\nBritish West Africa, an interest which has continued unabated during the\r\nentire period of his administration. In specific directions the result\r\nhas been all to the good. Railways, the preliminary surveys of which had\r\nbeen made by direction of Mr. Chamberlain’s predecessor, the Marquis\r\nof Ripon, before he quitted office, have been constructed; others are\r\ncommenced; the routes of more have been surveyed. The study of malaria\r\nhas received the right honourable gentleman’s warmest support. A general\r\npublicity has been given to British West Africa by its identification\r\nwith so powerful a politician as Mr. Chamberlain, which has materially\r\ncontributed to remove it from the rut of oblivion and popular ignorance.\r\nIt may also be added that the Colonial Secretary’s confident public\r\ndeclarations in respect to the future of the gold-mining industry in the\r\nGold Coast has done much to attract capital to that Colony, and that\r\nthe damper which he recently felt it wise to apply to the introduction\r\nof the more undesirable elements connected with the revival, under\r\nmodern conditions, of gold-mining enterprise in a part of the coast\r\ncelebrated for its former export of the precious metal, was entirely\r\nto his honour, although it would perhaps have been more useful had it\r\ncome somewhat earlier in the day; while the memorandum he caused to be\r\ndrawn up in September 1901 embodying the principle of treating native\r\nlabourers on the Gold Coast, is perhaps the most admirable document\r\never issued from the Colonial Office.[10] In like manner, it can be\r\ntaken for granted that all officials in West Africa are animated by\r\nthe best of intentions, and however profoundly one may differ, from\r\ntime to time, from certain of their actions, it is always essential to\r\nbear in mind that the system under which they work—the inconvenience of\r\nwhich not a few of them in private conversation readily admit—leaves\r\nthe door wide open to the commitment of errors for which the system is\r\nin the first place responsible, while the climate is most trying to\r\nthe constitutions and temper of Europeans. But it is unreasonable, and\r\nsubversive of the true interests of the Empire, that the tendency should\r\nbe encouraged to denounce honest criticism of a specific act of policy\r\nin West Africa with which this or that official must in the nature of\r\nthings be associated, although he need not be, and often is not, the\r\noriginator of it, as a personal attack upon an absent man, to be resented\r\nas an outrage and stigmatised almost as a crime, as an offence at any\r\nrate against common decency and fairness. The contention is absurd, and\r\nmischievous and unfair. The autocratic power which the Crown Colony\r\nsystem confers upon West African Governors, District Commissioners, and\r\nmilitary commandants makes it absolutely essential that independent\r\ncriticism, so long as it is legitimate, should be exercised by the public\r\nat home, whether or no full sanction has been obtained by a particular\r\nofficial from the Colonial Office for the application of measures\r\ngiving rise to criticism, or whether the measures have been initiated\r\nby the Colonial Office itself. By public criticism alone can we hope\r\nto avoid the repetition of such deplorable mistakes as led to the Hut\r\nTax war in Sierra Leone and the last Ashanti outbreak; the framing of\r\nlegislation far in advance of the needs of the country and antagonistic\r\nto native feeling, which interest and duty alike imperatively demand,\r\nshould be taken into consideration; the constant recurrence of punitive\r\nexpeditions, which in another portion of our Tropical African Empire have\r\nworked such incalculable injury; and financial embarrassments, outcome of\r\nmismanagement, extravagance, and errors of policy.\r\n\r\nThere is always danger in reaction, as in the body physical, so in the\r\nbody politic; and it is not altogether astonishing, perhaps, that the\r\nlong spell of official apathy in West Africa, being suddenly changed\r\nto precipitate action, should have given rise to some objectionable\r\nfeatures. But it cannot be admitted that the latter, instead of being\r\na passing phenomenon, should take permanent root, and become part\r\nand parcel of the new order of things. If this be the case, we shall\r\npresently be witnessing yet another reaction in West Africa, and with\r\nembarrassed finances, a yearly expenditure far in excess of any visible\r\nincrease in producing power, increased taxation, a native population\r\nalienated and disorganised, and energetic rivals forging ahead while\r\nwe continue to struggle painfully in a quagmire of self-imposed\r\ndifficulties, the public will lapse once more into its old attitude of\r\nindifference tinged with dislike, until some brilliant gentleman at the\r\nForeign Office, deeming the moment opportune, hands over a further slice\r\nof British West Africa to a Foreign Power, in exchange for cod-fisheries,\r\nor something equally vital to the Empire’s prosperity.[11] The forward\r\npolicy in West Africa has had its uses; it has served its purpose. We\r\nare secure in the possession of a large territory some 700,000 square\r\nmiles in extent, unsurpassed in natural wealth by any other region in\r\nthe globe, containing a population of probably 30,000,000 to 35,000,000\r\nsouls, of whose habits and customs we possess but the haziest knowledge,\r\nwhose very languages we are in the main ignorant of; a population\r\ncomposed of the most diverse elements, the resources of whose widely\r\nscattered habitat are barely tapped, whose willing co-operation, which is\r\nessential to the success of our rule, can only be gained by scientific,\r\npainstaking study and the most tactful, sympathetic treatment. Now should\r\nbe a close time for British West Africa. The country needs political\r\nrest. It has been turned topsy-turvy by European rivalry; old landmarks\r\nhave been swept away; the boundaries of Native States altered to suit the\r\nexigencies of European diplomacy; immemorial trade roads interfered with.\r\nThe native requires breathing space. Official activity should in the main\r\nbe limited to the construction, with due regard to method and economy,\r\nof certain indispensable public works, collecting data concerning the\r\nnative peoples and respective regions in which they dwell, strengthening\r\nnative authority so rudely disturbed by recent events; in protecting\r\ncommerce, encouraging capital, fostering native industries—perfecting\r\nthose in existence and preparing the ground for others; in short, a work\r\nof gradual, sure, systematic consolidation. It should be our object to\r\nintermeddle as little as possible with native institutions, abide with\r\nscrupulous exactitude to both the spirit and the letter of our treaties\r\nwith the Chiefs; develop the native peoples along the lines of their own\r\ncivilisation both in the case of Mohammedans and Pagans; use conciliation\r\nin preference to dictation, gold rather than the sword. Administrative\r\nextravagance should be rigidly held in check for fear of burdening new\r\nColonies with a load of debt; the soldier and the policeman should be\r\nkept in the background, only to be used as a last extremity. Commerce,\r\ngood roads, _and statesmanship_ should be our preferable choice of\r\nweapons for mitigating evils, some at least of which the example of\r\nEurope in the past has intensified, others lying in deep-rooted religious\r\nbeliefs, requiring careful preliminary investigation and thorough\r\nunderstanding before being made the object of official action, and then\r\nonly of a repressive nature after every pacific inducement had been tried\r\nin vain. Patience, more patience, and again patience. That should be,\r\nought to be, the corner-stone of British policy in West Africa. It was\r\nthe tortoise that won the race; not the hare.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the hare is the more popular beast just now, and the\r\nforward policy is as much in evidence in British West Africa to-day as it\r\nwas five years ago, with the result that what may have been justifiable\r\nthen bids fair, if it be not stopped in time, to be disastrous now that\r\nthe necessity for it has passed away with the close of international\r\ncompetition. Energy is being misapplied and misdirected. Let it be\r\nconceded that the existing basis of rule in West Africa, the Crown Colony\r\nsystem, is the worst in the world to stand the strain of a naturally\r\nactive directing influence at headquarters; let it be admitted that it\r\nis a clumsy, inelastic instrument which allows the governed no voice\r\nin the government, which places the suppliers of revenue, both direct\r\nand indirect, in the position of having no effective control over the\r\nexpenditure of that revenue, which permits of the jeopardising of years\r\nof commercial effort by some ill-considered legislative act—let these\r\nand many other counts against the Crown Colony system be admitted. The\r\nfact nevertheless remains that that system is capable of reform, of\r\nmodification, of being moulded in accordance with the requirements of\r\nthe case. The task should not be beyond the capacity of statecraft. Is\r\nit to be seriously maintained that British statesmanship has sunk so low\r\nthat machinery suitable to a bygone age cannot be improved and brought\r\nmore into line with our altered situation: that we must needs cling to\r\nevery ancient wheel and rivet though they be clogged with superfluous\r\nmatter, and eaten through with rust? If the machine which it was sought\r\nto preserve intact had done yeoman service in past days, there might\r\nbe some excuse for hesitating to supply it with new works. But that is\r\nemphatically not so with the West African machine.\r\n\r\nAnd it is positively heart-breaking to see that the last few years, far\r\nfrom bringing any reforms, far from holding out the hope of reform in\r\nthe future, have but accentuated the evil. We cannot, it is true, lose\r\nany more territory, unless we care to give away that which is assured\r\nto us by international agreement. But in almost every other respect the\r\nCrown Colony system, as it prevails in West Africa, and under the new\r\ncircumstances in which it is performing its functions, is building up\r\na legacy of trouble which can only be contemplated with equanimity, or\r\nviewed with indifference, by the thoughtless; by those good people who\r\nrefuse to walk save in pleasant places, who constitutionally dislike\r\ncriticism as much as a cat objects to a wetting.\r\n\r\nHaste and hurry are the order of the day in British West Africa.\r\nExpenditure is going up by leaps and bounds,[12] altogether apart from\r\nexpenditure on public works. In the case of public works, large and\r\ncostly undertakings are arranged for on the most unpractical lines,\r\nwith no effort to benefit by competition, no putting out to tender,\r\nno safeguards without which a business man of ordinary intelligence\r\nwill surround himself in order that he may be sure of getting the best\r\nvalue for his money. An extraordinary theory in economics has become\r\nfashionable. It is that the higher the revenue of a given West African\r\nColony the more prosperous that Colony must be, quite oblivious of the\r\neffect which every increase of taxation has upon the volume of trade in\r\nthe way of reduction, and driving it away to the neighbouring territory\r\nof a foreign rival. If a West African Colony shows in a given year\r\nan increase of £10,000 in revenue, obtained from increased taxation,\r\njubilation in official quarters is excessive: but either nothing is\r\nheard of the falling off in trade accompanying the increase in revenue,\r\nor it is explained in some other way. The fact that there is a gain\r\nin revenue is held to be proof positive of an abounding prosperity\r\nand wise management. Every fresh increase in revenue is followed by a\r\ncorresponding increase in expenditure. The one is made to keep pace with\r\nthe other. It does not always succeed, because the expenditure is not\r\ninfrequently in excess of the revenue _quand même_. It is also becoming\r\nthe usual thing to financially assist these Colonies by “loans” or\r\n“grants-in-aid” or “advances” quite on the West Indian model, while the\r\nofficial reports invariably lead off with the reassuring statement that\r\n“this Colony has no public debt”: a little farther on, casual reference\r\nto the “grant-in-aid” may be discovered by the aid of a microscope,\r\ntucked away in some obscure corner, a footnote for choice. Lagos, Sierra\r\nLeone, the Gold Coast, Nigeria, are all at the present moment in the\r\nenjoyment of Imperial loans: Sierra Leone for the Railway and the late\r\nHut-Tax war, Lagos for the Railway, the Gold Coast for the Railway and\r\nAshanti war, Nigeria for the purchase of the Niger Co.’s treaties with\r\nthe natives (the terms of which we have not adhered to), and for raising\r\nan army. Meantime, our neighbours the French are—in their West Coast\r\nColonies proper, where comparison alone is possible—making their own\r\nColonies pay a considerable part in the expenses of Railway construction;\r\ntaxing their trade less, spending less on administration, governing more\r\ncheaply and quite as well—better by a long way in some cases.\r\n\r\nThe producing power of our Colonies, that is to say, the export trade,\r\nthe only true test of prosperity in West Africa, is either increasing\r\nslowly by comparison with the expenditure, or it is stagnant, or it is\r\nretrogressing. When it is increasing, the increase is much below the\r\ncorresponding ratio of increased expenditure. “Large doses”—veritable\r\npurgatives—of European conceived legislation are being thrust down the\r\nthroats of the bewildered natives. The number of Ordinances passed in the\r\nBritish West African Colonies during the last few years, especially in\r\nSouthern Nigeria,[13] is simply amazing. Most of them are far in advance\r\nof the times and cannot but remain a dead letter because, thank goodness,\r\nthe existing machinery is not yet sufficiently extensive to carry them\r\nout. To make as few Ordinances as possible, and to ensure that such as\r\nare made shall be permanently useful, does not appear to enter into\r\nthe official conception; and in the face of the growing objections to\r\nthis rapidity and fertility of the official brain in forming premature\r\nlegislation, not only on the part of the natives who are getting more\r\nand more confused, and—as the French put it—_déséquilibrés_, but by all\r\npeople in affairs on the Coast who would desire that officialdom should\r\nmove more slowly, carrying at each step real and understanding consent:\r\nthe work of drafting portentous decrees, the exact meaning of which\r\nthe very lawyers at home cannot comprehend, or reconcile with avowed\r\nintentions, goes merrily on.\r\n\r\nPunitive expedition follows punitive expedition. We have had a war in\r\nSierra Leone, a war in Ashanti, two expeditions in the Gambia, a big\r\nexpedition up the Cross River in Southern Nigeria, together with minor\r\naffrays, while in Northern Nigeria, which so far is producing no revenue\r\nand has not attracted a single merchant (and but one exploring expedition\r\nfor possible mining purposes), one punitive expedition succeeds another\r\nat an interval of a few weeks at most. I will not now labour the case of\r\nNorthern Nigeria, as that most interesting portion of our West African\r\ndominions is discussed at some length farther on, but it is quite evident\r\nthat the attention of Parliament to the expenditure of Northern Nigeria\r\nis becoming increasingly urgent. Lagos alone, under the able guidance\r\nof Sir William MacGregor, has known the blessings of peace. Long may it\r\ncontinue to do so.\r\n\r\nSpecific instances and examples of these general statements will be found\r\nscattered throughout this volume. It was, however, necessary to place\r\nthem in collective form. In the next chapter, endeavour will be made to\r\nbriefly indicate the lines upon which certain reforms might be attempted\r\nand the reasons for those reforms. Official optimism notwithstanding,\r\nit is an undoubted fact that, if something is not very shortly done to\r\nimprove the prevailing system, the majority of the British West African\r\nColonies will drift into a morass of financial confusion paralysing\r\nto their development and progress, while the native population within\r\nthem will be comparatively poorer than in the neighbouring Colonies of\r\ncommercial rivals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSOME NECESSARY REFORMS\r\n\r\n    “It is well known also that this personal system, at its\r\n    best, is full of abuses of the worst kind politically; the\r\n    Administrators and those who influence them, get to have\r\n    favourites, and even chiefs have their legitimate power,\r\n    influence and dignity interfered with because they refuse to\r\n    pay homage to their views. In consequence of all this, an\r\n    apparently successful Administrator is usually and sharply\r\n    followed by even worse confusion and more protracted wars than\r\n    were known before his advent. It is the history of all weak\r\n    despotic systems, having no basis in the country or among\r\n    the people sought to be governed or influenced.”—“The Crown\r\n    Colonies of Great Britain” (chapter vi. West Africa), by C. S.\r\n    Salmon, formerly Colonial Secretary and Administrator of the\r\n    Gold Coast, &c.\r\n\r\n    “The inhabitants of the country and the mercantile community\r\n    who provide the whole of the revenues, have no voice at all in\r\n    the governing of their Colonies and the expenditure of these\r\n    revenues, and I sincerely hope that the day is not far distant\r\n    when the African community will rise up and protest against\r\n    this Crown Colony system of government”—Mr. ARTHUR HUTTON,\r\n    President of the African Section of the Manchester Chamber of\r\n    Commerce. (Extract from speech delivered.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will, I think, be conceded that, notwithstanding the extraordinarily\r\nimportant and revolutionising discoveries of Major Ross, to whom the\r\nentire credit of recent demonstrations belongs, the admirable work\r\nperformed by the Liverpool[14] and London schools in the study of\r\ntropical disease and sanitary improvements on the West Coast, the chances\r\nof British West Africa ever becoming a possession where English men\r\nand women can flourish and multiply, is excessively remote; so remote,\r\nindeed, as to be outside the sphere of useful discussion. In fact,\r\nwith the one possible exception of the Futa-Jallon uplands, when the\r\nKonakry-Kurussa railway line has connected them with the coast, West\r\nAfrica as a whole is unsuitable, and will, according to all reasonable\r\nsupposition, always remain unsuitable for European _colonisation_. The\r\ndominion of British West Africa must, therefore, be regarded not in the\r\nlight of a colony properly so called, but as a vast tropical estate.\r\n\r\nFrom that postulate arises a query, or rather, series of queries. What\r\nare we in West Africa for? What do we hope to do there? What object took\r\nus there? What main purpose keeps us there? The answer is not for a\r\nmoment in doubt. Commerce took us to West Africa; commerce keeps and will\r\nkeep us in West Africa. It is the _fons et origo_ of our presence in West\r\nAfrica. The day that it ceases to be so, West Africa ceases to be of use\r\nto the Empire. It will become a costly plaything, and the British people\r\nis too essentially practical a people to care long for toys of that kind.\r\nAs in every other part of the world, commerce in West Africa is the\r\noutcome of supply and demand. There is a demand for the products of West\r\nAfrica on the markets of the world, and there is a demand in West Africa\r\nfor the products of European industrialism. The increased circulation of\r\na portable currency in West Africa in the shape of silver coinage will\r\nfacilitate the operations of commerce, but will not dislodge or alter the\r\nfundamental nature of that commerce. The development of a mining industry\r\nin this or that portion of West Africa will, while it lasts, modify the\r\nconditions of trade in the portion affected, but commerce will remain the\r\nbackbone, as it ever has been, of European intercourse with West Africa.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing that need occasion regret at the contemplation of the\r\ntruth. Commerce is the greatest civilising agent. The steps upward in\r\nthe ethical development of the human race have been synonymous with\r\nthe spread of commercial relations, and the creation of the means and\r\nmeasures whereby their promotion has been successively extended. The\r\nmost backward peoples to-day are, generally speaking, those whose\r\nsecluded habitat renders their commercial transactions with the outside\r\nworld scanty and precarious. In these days, when the noble meaning\r\nwhich attaches to “philanthropy” and “civilisation” is made the cloak\r\nto cover in West Africa so much that is vile, the excuse both sincerely\r\nand hypocritically given to explain away so much that is in painful\r\ncontradiction, one needs, perhaps, to be reminded that such commonplace\r\nthings as commerce and improved means of communication will do more\r\nto benefit the native than any number of attempts to impose laws and\r\ninstitutions unfamiliar to him, by violent even if well-meaning measures\r\nof so-called reform.[15] As a nation we should gain much and lose nothing\r\nin frankly admitting to ourselves that it is due neither to a desire\r\nto mend the ways of priestly theocracies, nor to alter the tyranny of\r\nthe strong over the weak, which has led to the incorporation within\r\nthe Empire of some thirty-five millions of West African natives, but\r\nthe belief that West Africa constitutes a vast outlet for the free and\r\nunfettered development of British trade, and an equally vast field for\r\nthe cultivation of products of economic necessity to ourselves. Thorough\r\nrealisation of the fact would lead to more accurate appreciation and a\r\ntruer sense of the direction which our policy should take in West Africa,\r\nif ultimate success and not failure is to attend it.\r\n\r\nCommercial development is then in an especial and peculiar degree the\r\n_raison d’être_ of our presence in West Africa.\r\n\r\nNow what are the principal factors in British West African commerce, and\r\nhow are their claims to consideration in the administration of British\r\nWest Africa treated under the Crown Colony system? Obviously the two\r\nprincipal factors are the European merchant and his customer, the native.\r\nThe merchant directly supplies, the native indirectly supplies, the\r\nrevenue which pays for the salaries of the officials and the general\r\nup-keep of the government, and if it be true, as it undoubtedly is,\r\nthat the burden of taxation ultimately falls upon the native producer,\r\nit is equally true that, without the enterprise of the merchant, there\r\nwould be no revenue and consequently no local funds for the support\r\nof administrative machinery. It follows, therefore, as a matter of\r\nsimple justice, that the merchant should have a voice in the framing of\r\nlegislation calculated to affect the internal politics, and consequently\r\nthe commerce of our West African possessions. Apart from its justice,\r\nthe claim of the merchant to representation in the affairs of our West\r\nAfrican Empire has many features in its favour. He enjoys an expert’s\r\nknowledge, gained by long years of actual contact with the peoples of\r\nWestern Africa. Experience has given him an insight into their customs\r\nand laws; an acquaintance with their peculiarities, with the working\r\nof their minds, with their inbred conservatism, which officials whose\r\nresidence in West Africa—broken, as it is, by long intervals of leave—is\r\nusually of a very temporary or flitting nature, cannot hope to attain at\r\nany rate with the same completeness; and a mastery, even if it be only an\r\ninstinctive mastery, of certain special characteristics which underlie\r\nnative conceptions, and which have to be reckoned with in dealing with\r\nthem. The merchant is consequently well fitted to be a most valuable\r\nassistant in the administration of British Western Africa.\r\n\r\nThe fact is recognised by the French and Germans who share with us the\r\nvast proportion of influence in West Africa properly so called. Ever\r\npractical, the Germans have created an Advisory Board (_Kolonial-rath_)\r\nto their Colonial Office, composed for the most part of the leading\r\nmen in the West African trade. The present Colonial Advisory Board has\r\ntwelve merchants sitting on its Council.[16] In French West Africa,\r\nbut on somewhat different lines, the merchant is similarly treated, and\r\njust recently the representations of the French merchants to M. Décrais,\r\nthe then Colonial Minister of France, averted a great evil threatening\r\nthe Ivory Coast in the contemplated cession to King Leopold’s nominee,\r\nM. Empain, of a practical monopoly over the whole of the gold-bearing\r\ndistricts of that dependency, although M. Empain[17] had the most\r\ninfluential support at his back.\r\n\r\nThe French system, though far from perfect, is incomparably superior\r\nto anything we have in this country. It differs somewhat in the\r\nvarious Colonies, but is substantially composed of two Organisms, the\r\nMetropolitan Organism and the Colonial Organism. Under these dual\r\nOrganisms, every Colony which is not directly represented in the French\r\nParliament is represented at the Colonial Office by a delegate elected\r\nby vote of the white inhabitants of such Colony. In French Guinea, where\r\nthe administration in force is in advance of that of any other French (or\r\nEnglish for that matter) West African possession, a commercial delegate\r\nis regularly elected, and at the present moment a merchant, M. Gaboriau,\r\nrepresenting the interests of that Colony, is attached to the Colonial\r\nOffice. The weak point in the arrangement is, that the officials in the\r\nrespective Colonies as well as the merchants have the right to vote in\r\nthe election of a representative, with the result that very often the\r\nofficials are in a majority. When that happens, a French politician, who\r\ncan use his influence in promoting the officials who vote for him, is\r\nappointed. Each colony possesses a “Superior Council” or “Administrative\r\nCouncil” composed of the Governor, the heads of departments, and two or\r\nmore merchants. In Senegal the merchant councillors have always enjoyed\r\nconsiderable power, and no step affecting the interests of the Colony is\r\never taken without the concurrence of the great Bordeaux merchant firms,\r\nwhich between them centralise the ground-nut trade (they themselves\r\nbuilt it up), the staple industry of Senegal. Moreover, Senegal is\r\nparticularly favoured in that it boasts a Deputy in the Chamber and a\r\nlocal General Council which enjoys large financial responsibility, the\r\nmerchants—provided they do not fall out among themselves—being always in\r\na majority in the said General Council.\r\n\r\nWith us matters are altogether different. England, which passes for\r\na country where common-sense is the cardinal virtue, refuses to her\r\nmerchants any recognised _status_ in the administrative machinery of\r\nWest Africa. It has been accurately asserted that the merchant is the\r\n_uitlander_ of British West Africa. He is seldom, if ever, consulted in\r\nthe affairs of the country, and although Mr. Chamberlain has on more\r\nthan one occasion given verbal assurances that no legislative acts\r\naffecting the natives (and _de facto_ calculated to influence native\r\nproduction—or, in other words, trade) would be promulgated without\r\npreviously being submitted to the merchants for their opinion, decrees of\r\nthe highest importance embodying a kind of revolution in our historical\r\nnative policy in regard to the laws of native land tenure have just\r\nbecome law in Southern Nigeria, not only without the merchants being\r\nconsulted, but without their being advised in any other way than by a\r\nperusal of the published Ordinances in the local Government Gazette. From\r\ntime to time—and during the last two years with increasing frequency,\r\nconsistency, and earnestness—the Liverpool and Manchester Chambers of\r\nCommerce, which between them represent the majority of the commercial\r\ninterests of Great Britain in West Africa,[18] have approached the\r\nForeign and Colonial Offices on their own initiative, sometimes\r\nsupported by as many as ten or twelve other leading chambers in the\r\nKingdom voicing industrial interests more or less directly affected by\r\nspecific occurrences. When—I am speaking now of recent times—the Foreign\r\nOffice has been either memorialised or waited upon by deputations from\r\nthe Chambers, the question at issue has been one of international import,\r\nsuch for instance as the differential tariff against British goods in the\r\nFrench West African Colonies (1898), and the violation of the Berlin Act\r\nin the Congo Basin (1901 and 1902). In the first case, the action of the\r\nChambers was surprisingly successful; in the second case, success has not\r\nyet attended their efforts.\r\n\r\nWhen, as in the majority of instances, the Colonial Office has been\r\nwaited upon or written to, the object has referred to some legislation\r\neither contemplated or assented to, or to some measure of internal policy\r\ntowards a native tribe or ruler. I cannot find that the Colonial Office\r\nhas on any single occasion, in a matter of importance, consented to adopt\r\nthe views of the men who, as subsequent events have manifestly proved,\r\nsaw clearer than the permanent officials, and whose advice, if taken,\r\nwould have avoided the perpetration of serious mistakes. In 1895 the\r\nManchester Chamber and the local Chamber at Cape Coast strongly advised\r\n“that the King of Ashanti (Prempreh) be allowed to reserve all the rights\r\nthat he now exercises over his people,” but that a British resident\r\nshould be established at his Court, as the best means of ensuring a\r\nlasting peace with the Ashanti people, who, if they had erred, also\r\nhad—as is historically admitted—grounds of legitimate complaint against\r\nthe British authorities on various occasions. Prempreh, however, was\r\narrested and deported, and from that moment the Ashantis never ceased to\r\nintrigue against the British until their discontent, fanned into flame by\r\nthe injudicious proceedings of Governor Hodgson, broke forth once more\r\nand led to the last sanguinary expedition, which involved an expenditure\r\nof a quarter of a million of money.\r\n\r\nBut the most notable instance at once, of the value of the merchants’\r\nexpert knowledge and of the fatuity of lightly rejecting their counsel,\r\nis provided in the lamentable chapter in the history of Sierra Leone\r\nwhich began with the enforcement of the Hut Tax Ordinance in 1898, and\r\nwhich is not yet closed, whatever officialdom may say to the contrary.\r\nAs I propose discussing this subject in some detail later on, it is\r\nsufficient to state here that the merchants almost went on their bended\r\nknees, figuratively speaking, in seeking to turn the Colonial Office\r\nfrom its purpose; that they entirely failed; that they were met by\r\nofficial assurances which were afterwards shown to be entirely erroneous;\r\nthat their predictions and warnings were fulfilled to the letter; that\r\ntheir views were subsequently substantiated in every respect by the\r\nSpecial Commissioner despatched later by the Colonial Office to make\r\ninvestigations as to the origin of the rising, and that the persistent\r\nrefusal of the Colonial Office to abide by the Special Commissioner’s\r\nreport has reduced our oldest West African possession to such a\r\ncondition that, if the railway now in course of construction through\r\nthe eastern district does not—and there appears little or no hope that\r\nit will—entirely alter the present state of affairs, Sierra Leone under\r\nthe present _régime_, and with the pressure of French competition in the\r\nneighbouring territories, is irretrievably ruined.\r\n\r\nIs it not time that in this respect at least something was done to\r\nbring the management of British West Africa more into line with modern\r\nrequirements, and at a period when the commercial position of Great\r\nBritain in West Africa is everywhere threatened by foreign competition,\r\nto establish some working arrangement—call it a West African Council or\r\nAdvisory Board or anything you please—whereby the accumulated experience\r\nof the men who are supplying the Government with the wherewithal to\r\ngovern, should be used as an auxiliary force for the promotion of the\r\ngeneral interests of Great Britain in West Africa? The nucleus of such a\r\ncouncil or Advisory Board could be at once supplied.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the merchants cannot agree amongst themselves. The plea\r\nlacks in truthfulness, and it is permissible to doubt whether it is\r\nsincerely put forward. Unquestionably there are rivalries in the West\r\nAfrican trade. What trade is without them? But to argue that competition\r\nin trade is a bar to co-operation in matters affecting the general\r\nwelfare of the country is a very narrow-minded position to take up.\r\nIt is converting a legitimate, natural, and healthy phenomenon into a\r\ndisqualification which nothing justifies. Where should we be in West\r\nAfrica to-day but for our merchant pioneers? Suppose they had endorsed\r\nthe official resolution of 1865 by withdrawing from the Coast, would the\r\nUnion Jack be floating in West Africa except in Sierra Leone to-day? If\r\nthe merchant had been devoid of political conception, and content to\r\nlet his horizon be confined to those petty but inevitable aspects of\r\ncommercialism which consist in under-selling a competitor, would not the\r\nabandonment of the Gold Coast have followed the battle of Katamansu, and\r\nwould the richest portion of the Niger Valley be a British Protectorate\r\nto-day? Let those who suggest that the British merchant in West Africa\r\nis incapable of rising above sordid motives of self-interest remember\r\nMacGregor Laird. The merchant has everywhere preceded the administrator\r\nin West Africa. In his case the old adage must be reversed. It has been\r\nthe flag which has followed trade, not trade the flag.[19]\r\n\r\nIt is also said that the merchants are not unanimous with regard to\r\ncertain features of West African policy. But can any one single out a\r\nbody of men among whom variations of opinion on specific points do not\r\noccur? Do all the members of a Cabinet invariably see eye to eye on a\r\nparticular measure to be introduced? Are not the very modifications which\r\nany given Bill must go through before being finally drafted and approved\r\nby the Cabinet as a whole a guarantee that legislation evolved from\r\nthe interchange of ideas among the sundry persons concerned—and who,\r\nunless they be devoid of individuality, cannot all think alike on every\r\npoint—will be the better for the destructive and constructive criticism\r\nto which it has been subjected? The merchants are in substantial\r\nagreement in what they consider the vital principles of British policy\r\nin West Africa, principles which informed public opinion is at last\r\nbeginning to realise the urgency of upholding. No material divergency\r\nof views will be found among merchants as to the absolute necessity of\r\nrespecting native land tenure, the need of careful finance, the danger\r\nof constant military operations, the indispensableness of preserving\r\nnative institutions. If there be a charge against the merchants, it\r\nis that they have not hitherto sufficiently exercised their power of\r\ninfluencing successive Governments. They have not risen as they should\r\nhave done to the height of their duties and responsibilities. They have\r\nallowed outsiders to perform a difficult and generally ungrateful work,\r\nwhich they themselves should have taken in hand—that of calling public\r\nattention to the urgency of reforms in West African administration. At\r\ncritical moments they have been weak-kneed, and fearful of giving offence\r\nwhen they should have been resolute in standing by convictions which\r\nthey knew to be sound. Their attitude is now happily undergoing a change\r\nwhich, if maintained, is bound to have lasting results for good.\r\n\r\nAt no previous period in the history of British West Africa has\r\nthe co-operation of the great merchant community in the task of\r\nadministration been so pressing a necessity as it is to-day. Never could\r\nbetter use be made of such co-operation by the department responsible\r\nfor West Africa as at present. In the increasing notice which is\r\nbeing given on all sides to West African affairs consequent upon the\r\nremarkable growth of European relations with that country and with the\r\nbirth in West Africa of a modern mining industry, a host of dangerous\r\nadvisers is arising. We see old errors creeping back in the guise of\r\nnew verities, old misconceptions gaining fresh lease of life, exploded\r\ntheories crowding forward to mislead and confuse. Appeals to force as\r\nthe solution of all difficulties arising out of contact with a primitive\r\npeople, contemptuous disregard of native laws and customs—the “damned\r\nnigger” theory in all its perennial beauty, insistent requests for lavish\r\nexpenditure, heedless of plain economic facts, and so forth—these are the\r\norder of the day. Upon elementary errors of geography are grafted the\r\ncrudest notions of the political and social condition of the Negro, the\r\nmost amazing ignorance of history and past experience in every branch of\r\nWest African lore. By a plausible inversion of facts, opponents of the\r\nwild and whirling talk indulged in regarding West Africa are denounced\r\nas sentimentalists, although it so happens that the denouncers draw the\r\nmaterial which serves them as a basis for their contentions from that\r\nvery discredited sentimentalism responsible for so many errors in West\r\nAfrica, which portrays the native as an abject being, brutish, lazy,\r\nand degraded, greatly honoured by the bestowal of a bible, a suit of\r\nclothes; and a shilling, with a possible extra threepence thrown in as\r\nsubsistence-money, for a hard day’s work. No doubt it is possible to\r\nexaggerate the importance of these _ad captandum_ effusions, but their\r\nvolume is, perhaps, calculated to momentarily drown the voice of reason.\r\nParrot-like reiteration, if sufficiently sustained, is apt sometimes to\r\nimpress.\r\n\r\nAt such a time the assistance of a trained body of men thoroughly\r\nconversant with the affairs of Western Africa, in a position to point to\r\npast experiences, to vested interests, to technical knowledge as their\r\nclaim to competency, and to the feeding of the administrative machine\r\nas their claim to consideration, ought surely to commend itself to the\r\nAuthorities. To persist much longer in the rejection of that assistance\r\nwould be equally short-sighted and unjust.\r\n\r\nAnother and an equally important question connected with the management\r\nof our West African Possessions, is the question of the Crown Agents. If\r\nany one attempted to define the duties of that body, he would be hard\r\nput to it to do so. They are here, there and everywhere, and their\r\ninterference puts a premium upon extravagance and waste. The Crown Agents\r\nare an anomaly which ought to disappear. At present they constitute a\r\nsort of half-way house between the Colonial Office and the West African\r\nGovernors, and are a positive obstacle to sound finance and good business\r\nmethods. Enough examples of the extraordinary ways of the Crown Agents\r\ncould be given to fill a volume. The West African Colonies are hampered\r\nright and left by the powers conferred upon this body. The Colonies\r\nare not allowed to purchase what they require in the shape of stores,\r\nequipment, material and so forth on the open market. Everything has to\r\ngo through the Crown Agents, with the natural result that the Colonies\r\nhave to pay 40 per cent. and 50 per cent. more than they would have to if\r\nallowed to invite tenders on their own account. Look at the way in which\r\nthese railways have been and are being built.\r\n\r\nThe construction is, apparently, the monopoly of one particular firm\r\n(under the direction of the Crown Agents); a firm which, as far as can be\r\ngathered, had had but little experience in railway construction before,\r\nmetaphorically speaking, falling upon its feet in West Africa.\r\n\r\nThe same firm holds the position of “consulting engineers” to the\r\nColonial Office. Surely it is anomalous, from the purely business\r\npoint of view, that a firm retained as “consulting engineers” to a\r\nGovernment Department in charge of West Africa should also be the actual\r\nconstructors of the West African railways! The two parts strike one as\r\nincompatible. Consulting engineers, one would imagine, would be advisers\r\nand arbiters. All contracts should be publicly and openly tendered for.\r\nA very widespread impression prevails that the time and cost expended in\r\nthe construction of these railways have been very great. The Gold Coast\r\nRailway was begun in February 1898; it is officially estimated to reach\r\nKumasi early in 1904. Assuming that it does, it will have taken six years\r\nto build, which works out at about twenty-eight miles per annum—the\r\ndistance from Sekondi to Kumasi being 169¼ miles.\r\n\r\nIt is as yet too early to say definitely what the cost of the line will\r\naverage per mile. Official estimates, we know, are not always reliable.\r\nIn this case, even the official estimate is very high, viz. £8000\r\nper mile for the Sekondi-Tarkwa section, and £6300 per mile for the\r\nTarkwa-Kumasi section.\r\n\r\nThat dissatisfaction with the policy pursued up to the present (that is\r\nto say, the policy of constructing these railways under the “Department\r\nSystem,” or, otherwise stated, leaving their construction to the\r\nCrown Agents), is not confined to merchants, mine-managers and other\r\nrevenue-payers of the West African Colonies, but is held by competent and\r\nhighly placed officials, I reproduce the following remarks of Sir William\r\nMacGregor, made on the occasion of a visit to the Manchester Chamber of\r\nCommerce in 1900, and in reply to the following question of Mr. Arthur\r\nHutton’s[20]:\r\n\r\n    “Do you think, from what you have seen, it (_i.e._ railway\r\n    construction) would be better done by contract?”\r\n\r\n    SIR WILLIAM MACGREGOR: “I believe at the present moment—and I\r\n    have said so to the Secretary of State—_I believe there would\r\n    be men living who are now rotting in their graves, if it had\r\n    been taken out of the control of the Crown Agents_....”[21]\r\n\r\nIt is competently estimated that the Lagos railway, begun in 1896, will\r\nhave cost £10,000[22] per mile by the time its 125 miles are in full\r\nworking order—an enormous rate. The Crown Agents, through whom the\r\nmoneys have been advanced to the Colony, exact 5 per cent. interest,\r\nwhereas with the security they have to offer, they should easily be able\r\nto get them—and probably have got them—from the Treasury at 3 per cent.\r\nWhy should the Colony be saddled with an extra 2[23] per cent. interest\r\nand find its liability for the current year on the railway loan increased\r\nto the enormous total of £54,000, or, say, 22 per cent. of the entire\r\nrevenue?[24] Why should all indents be sent through the Crown Agents? The\r\ndelays which this ridiculous system entail are only second in point of\r\nimportance to the squandering of the public funds which goes on under it.\r\nThe Crown Agents appear to think that they know more about the material\r\nneeds of the Colonies than the officials in charge of the Colonies\r\nthemselves. Two instances have been recently brought to my notice\r\nwhich would be laughable were they not so deplorably unbusiness-like.\r\nA certain West African Colony required a two-ton engine for a short,\r\nlight railway. The request was duly put forward. After months of delay\r\nan eight-ton engine was sent out, too heavy, of course, for the rails to\r\nsupport it. It was entirely useless. Again, a scheme was drawn up for the\r\nconstruction of a bridge by the local official responsible. An estimate\r\nwas made, and the plans and so forth were forwarded home. The bridge\r\nwas urgently required. Months elapsed; then the Crown Agents, who knew\r\nnothing of the local conditions, instead of despatching the materials,\r\nsent out an entirely different counter-scheme, far more elaborate, far\r\nmore costly, and totally unsuited to local requirements. The Colony is\r\nstill waiting for its bridge.[25] I can only repeat that, whether avowed\r\nor not—in many cases, of course, it manifestly cannot be avowed—the Crown\r\nAgents are looked upon in official and commercial circles in West Africa\r\nas an unmitigated nuisance and a stumbling-block to progress.\r\n\r\nThe needs of British West Africa at the present time may be resumed thus:\r\n(1) A Council or Advisory Board in which the merchant element shall be\r\nwidely represented; (2) Tight control over the military element—fewer\r\npunitive expeditions, and more tact and patience in dealing with native\r\nraces, the officials whose administration is virgin of wars to be looked\r\nupon as deserving of prior promotion; (3) Economy in Administration;\r\n(4) Thorough financial overhaul; (5) Elimination of the Crown Agents;\r\n(6) Open tenders for all public works; (7) Sanitation; (8) Scientific\r\nstudy of native peoples, laws and languages; (9) Scientific study of\r\nnative products and improvement of native industries; (10) Maintenance\r\nand not murder of native institutions, upholding and strengthening of\r\nthe power of the Chiefs; non-interference with domestic slavery in\r\nthe Protectorates; preservation of native land-tenure; (11) A Civil\r\nService on the lines of the Indian Civil Service; (12) A Civilian\r\nGovernor-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE DISCOVERY OF NORTHERN NIGERIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century will ever be memorable for the exploration of the\r\ninterior of the African Continent. It is difficult to realise when we\r\nread in the daily newspapers of steamers plying upon Tanganyika, ocean\r\nsteamers of 4000 tons burthen ploughing their way through the brown\r\nwaters of the Lower Congo, gun-boats patrolling the Niger, railways\r\npiercing alike the deserts of the Eastern Sudan and the forests of\r\nEquatoria, telegraphs extending in a network of lines across the Western\r\nSudan and athwart the Great Central Lakes—it seems difficult, I say,\r\nwhen we read of these things to remember that at the close of the\r\neighteenth century the interior of Africa was to all intents and purposes\r\na blank, and that, even within the memory of most of us, the extent of\r\ngeographical knowledge we possessed respecting vast regions many times\r\nlarger than European Russia had made no progress since the days of\r\nHerodotus and Pliny. What a colossal work it has been, this solving of\r\nriddles which had baffled the world for ages upon ages! What prodigies\r\nof labour, of courage, of self-abnegation have been required to triumph\r\nover the obstacles which nature and man united in opposing to the early\r\npioneers of African research! How many splendid lives have been immolated\r\nupon the altar of the African Moloch!\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the remarkable progress in medical science and hygiene,\r\nand the potentialities of the modern rifle as a weapon of defence\r\nagainst the attack of man and beast, the difficulties of the African\r\ntraveller at the present day are sufficiently great. Deadly maladies\r\nbeset him on every side, and the chance of coming to a sudden and violent\r\nend is ever present. But these difficulties are as dust in the balance\r\ncompared with the sufferings and privations which the first explorers\r\nof unknown Africa had to endure. Think of Park, and picture to yourself\r\nthe position of a lonely European wandering about inland Western Africa\r\nin a thick blue fustian coat, with gilt buttons, keeping his precious\r\nnotes in the crown of a top-hat, and kicked, buffeted, spat upon, treated\r\nwith contumely and scorn, subjected to every possible insult, over and\r\nagain a slave, exposed for hours at a time in a burning sun without\r\nwater, often on the verge of starvation, racked by disease, and in so\r\nmiserable a plight upon many occasions that death would have been a\r\nwelcome relief—yet triumphing over everything and finally returning,\r\nnotes and all, to his own land. Park’s experiences naturally occur to\r\none in relation to the subject which it is proposed to treat in this\r\nchapter, because Park was the real discoverer of the Niger, which had\r\nbeen known in a vague manner to the ancients, and also to the Arabs (who,\r\nhowever, wrongly ascribed to it a westerly course, and identified it\r\nwith the Nile),[26] and laid the foundation of that remarkable series of\r\nexplorations which ultimately ended in Lander’s supreme success.\r\n\r\nIn 1805 Park set out once more on his second and fatal journey, with the\r\nfirm conviction that he would be able to prove to the world the accuracy\r\nof his own theory, viz. that the Niger and the Congo were one and the\r\nsame. The peripatetics of that eventful voyage are known to every student\r\nof Africa. After incredible hardships, Park managed to descend the Niger\r\nas far as Bussa. There, in sight almost of the goal of his ambitions\r\nhe perished, victim of a cruel fate, which drove his boat upon those\r\ntreacherous rocks, since celebrated for having brought two Christian\r\nnations to the brink of war. There are aspects of Park’s character which\r\nleave something to be desired, but his defects are lost sight of in the\r\nmagnificence of his courage, his indomitable will, and the never-failing\r\noptimism with which he pursued his task, undeterred by disappointment and\r\nunshaken by adversity. As an example of human perseverance and fortitude\r\ncarried to its highest limits, Park probably holds an unique position\r\namong African explorers.\r\n\r\nPark’s tragic end increased the desire of Englishmen to solve the mystery\r\nof the Niger’s course, and in 1816 the British Government organised a\r\ndual expedition on a large scale for this purpose. One section, under\r\nCaptain Tuckey, ascended the Congo, and the other, under Major Peddie,\r\nendeavoured to reach the Niger by a more southerly route than that\r\nadopted by Park, the idea being that both sections would ultimately meet\r\nsomewhere in Central Africa. How fantastic was the scheme does not need\r\nto be pointed out, but it must be remembered that in those days the\r\nconsensus of learned opinion favoured Park’s theory of identification\r\nconcerning the Niger and the Congo. The expedition was an utter failure.\r\nThe Niger section excited the resentment of the natives, and had to\r\nreturn after losing its chief. Captain Tuckey ascended the Congo as far\r\nas the first cataracts, which had baffled the Portuguese for 200 years,\r\nand then leaving the River, pushed North, along what used to be the old\r\ncaravan route, to the Upper River, now covered by the Matadi-Stanleyville\r\nrailway, constructed by Colonel Thys. He managed to strike the Upper\r\nRiver in the neighbourhood of the modern Leopoldville, but the trying\r\nlandmarch had played havoc with his followers. Sickness broke out, and\r\nfinally the expedition had to return with a loss of 75 per cent. of\r\nits European members. Several lesser attempts followed. They all ended\r\ndisastrously, and it seemed as though the Dark Continent refused to\r\nyield up its secrets. But Englishmen were not to be beaten. The Western\r\nroute was indeed given up as impracticable for a time, but what could\r\nnot be accomplished from the West might be achieved from the North.\r\nTrue, the Desert had to be faced and traversed. But where the Phœnician\r\nand the Roman had dared and done, the Englishman might surely follow.\r\nThe Desert had not balked the Sectaries of Mohammed, and long caravans,\r\nconducted by Tripolitan merchants, yearly made their way across those\r\ndreary solitudes. Why should not a party of Englishmen attach themselves\r\nto one of these caravans, and, protected by the influence of the British\r\nGovernment, armed with the authority of the Pasha of Tripoli, succeed\r\nin reaching the fertile countries of the South, whence rich supplies of\r\nostrich feathers, skins, ivory, gold dust, and slaves found their way to\r\nthe ports of the Northern littoral?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH OF THE NORTHERN PART OF AFRICA]\r\n\r\nFor many years the African Association had been collecting materials\r\nwith a view to a possible penetration by the Northern route. Once the\r\nidea found favour with the authorities, Mr. Lucas was despatched by the\r\nAssociation to Tripoli. He did very little in the way of exploration, but\r\nbrought back many interesting facts confirming Leo Africanus’ description\r\nin respect to the existence of flourishing kingdoms far away to the\r\nSouth, where arts and crafts had attained a high degree of development.\r\nRitchie and Lyon followed Lucas. Lyon managed to reach the southernmost\r\nlimits of Fezzan, on the borders of the Desert.[27] The Desert itself\r\nremained uncrossed, however, and the mystery of the Niger still unsolved.\r\nThen it was that the British Government determined to make a great effort\r\nto solve the problem, and fitted out an expedition, which did not,\r\nit is true, fulfil all that was expected of it, but which succeeded,\r\nnevertheless, in throwing a vivid light upon unknown Central Africa, and\r\nin disclosing to an astonished world the remarkable civilisation which,\r\nunder Arab, Berber, and Fulani influence, had arisen in the heart of that\r\nblack “Sudan” the “land of infidels,” and in popular conception,\r\n\r\n    “Of the cannibals that each other eat,\r\n    The anthropophagi, and men whose heads\r\n    Do grow beneath their shoulders.”\r\n\r\nAnd so the subjects of this sketch enter upon the scene—three men,\r\nClapperton, Denham and Oudney, none of them perhaps conspicuous for\r\nability, or qualified to make the most of their discoveries, yet animated\r\nall three with the ardent love of adventure for which their race has\r\never been famous, and whose united exertions enabled Western Europe to\r\nestimate the political and social conditions prevailing in the richest,\r\nmost populated, most fertile, and undoubtedly most interesting portion\r\nof the Dark Continent. It is peculiarly fitting that the region which\r\nthese Englishmen were the first Europeans to visit, and which we now\r\ndesignate by the name of Northern Nigeria, should have been ultimately\r\nincorporated with the British West African Empire by the foresight of\r\nanother Englishman, Sir George Taubman Goldie, and the diplomatic ability\r\nof the gallant Joseph Thomson. A word now as to the three companions. Of\r\nDenham and Oudney, we know little beyond what can be gathered from their\r\nown writings; Oudney was a medical man, and Denham held the rank of Major\r\nin the army. Oudney was the real leader of the expedition, with which\r\nhe had been entrusted by Earl Bathurst, then Secretary of State for the\r\nColonies; but his untimely death had the result of depreciating the part\r\nwhich he personally played during its first two years’ work. Clapperton\r\nhas written of him that he was “A man of unassuming deportment, pleasing\r\nmanners, steadfast perseverance and undaunted enterprise; while his mind\r\nwas fraught at once with knowledge, virtue and religion.” Major Denham’s\r\naction in joining a raiding party into Mandara (Eastern Bornu) has\r\nsomewhat tarnished his reputation, in my humble opinion very unjustly,\r\nalthough it is quite true that his action in this respect was the\r\ncause of serious embarrassment to Clapperton later on. In criticising\r\nDenham’s conduct on this occasion, we must bear in mind in the first\r\nplace that the Empire of Bornu, at that period, owing to various\r\ndynastic revolutions, and to the pressure of its powerful enemies on the\r\nEast—Baghirmi and Wadai—was in a state of more or less constant warfare\r\nboth within and without, and that warlike expeditions were constantly\r\ntaking place, faction fighting against faction and tribe against tribe,\r\nwarfare being in fact a more or less permanent institution in the social\r\nlife of the country. And in the second place, we must also recollect that\r\nthe members of the expedition had been instructed to examine and report\r\nupon all the various phases of life in the countries which they might\r\ntraverse. Now it was impossible for Denham to obtain a thorough knowledge\r\nof the habits of the people without personally investigating the manner\r\nin which they waged war upon their neighbours. Apart, therefore, from the\r\nnatural predilections of his soldierly instincts, which would lead him\r\nto find particular interest in matters of this kind, it may be assumed\r\nthat Denham considered it his duty to act as he did. Years afterwards,\r\nBarth found himself in much the same predicament. As it happened, the\r\nadventure nearly cost Denham his life. The raided proved too strong for\r\nthe raiders, and, assisted by the Fulani cavalry, completely defeated the\r\nlatter. Denham’s escape was a marvellous one. He lost everything, and was\r\nwounded in three places.\r\n\r\nAn account of Clapperton’s life is contributed by Lieut.-Colonel\r\nClapperton in the preface to Clapperton and Lander’s journal of the\r\nsecond expedition to Sokoto, published by Murray in 1829. Hugh Clapperton\r\nwas born in Dumfriesshire in 1788. At the age of thirteen he went to sea\r\nas an apprentice, and subsequently entered the Royal Navy. He served in\r\nthe _Renommée_ and _Venerable_, and visited the East Indies. He then\r\nwent to the Canadian Lakes, and participated in the American War of\r\nIndependence. In 1816 he got his commission. A year later the British\r\nvessels on the Canadian Lakes were paid off and laid up, and Clapperton\r\nreturned to England on half-pay. In 1820 he met Dr. Oudney in Edinburgh,\r\nand struck up a friendship which resulted in his accompanying the\r\nlatter to Africa. Of intellectual attainments he had none, but he was\r\nlarge-hearted, generous, and tolerant; courageous in the extreme, gifted\r\nwith an iron constitution, and of great physical strength. So much for\r\nthe personal characteristics of the trio. We may now examine the nature\r\nof their work. The narrative of the expedition in which all three took\r\npart is chiefly contributed by Denham. While Denham was compiling their\r\njoint notes, Clapperton started for Africa again, and reached Sokoto\r\nfrom Badagry on the West Coast. The story of Clapperton’s second journey\r\nwas written by himself, and afterwards published by his faithful servant\r\nRichard Lander, who was destined ultimately to follow the Niger down\r\nto the sea, thus finally solving the great problem in the attempted\r\nelucidation of which Park, Tucker, Clapperton and many others perished.\r\n\r\nThe primary, and in many respects the main, obstacle which had to be\r\novercome by Oudney and his companions, was the crossing of that portion\r\nof the Sahara which lies between Murzuk and Bornu, and which, to use\r\nDenham’s words, “Is made up of dark frowning hills of naked rock, in\r\ninterminable plains, strewed in some places with fragments of stone and\r\npebbles, in others of one vast level surface of sand, and in others,\r\nagain, the same material rising into immense mounds, altering their form\r\nand position according to the strength and direction of the winds.”\r\nCaravan routes across the desert had existed for many centuries, and\r\nthe commerce of the Central Sudan, with the parts of North Africa, was\r\nstill an important one. The route which the travellers hoped to take, in\r\ncompany with a party of merchants, was the shortest and safest one, that\r\nwhich starting from Tripoli passes through Murzuk and Bilma to Kuka, then\r\nthe capital of Bornu, situated on the shores of Lake Chad. The expedition\r\narrived at Tripoli in November 1821, but did not reach Murzuk, capital\r\nof Fezzan, until the 8th April 1822. Here the Englishmen met with such\r\na discouraging reception from the Sultan that on the 12th May, finding\r\nno chance of making any progress whatever, Major Denham started back to\r\nTripoli to interview the Pasha, by whom the British Government had been\r\npromised every possible assistance. The Pasha proving as lethargic as his\r\nprototype at Murzuk, Denham left Tripoli in a white heat of indignation\r\nto report his conduct to the British Government. This did not suit the\r\nPasha at all, and he sent three despatches after the irate Englishman\r\nbegging him to return, as he had arranged for an escort to accompany the\r\nexpedition to Bornu. The despatches reached Denham while the boat he had\r\ntaken passage in was quarantined outside Marseilles, and he forthwith\r\nset sail once more for the Barbary shore. On the 29th November 1822, or\r\na year after landing at Tripoli, the expedition left Murzuk, and set\r\nout upon its way to Bornu under the guidance of Bu-Kalum, a merchant\r\nof repute, much enamoured of pomp and show, and not over energetic in\r\nhis movements. Within a few weeks’ march from Murzuk the members of the\r\nexpedition were able to appreciate all the horrors of the trans-Desert\r\nslave trade in the sight of “more than 100 skeletons, scattered over the\r\nline of route, some of them with the skin attached to the bones.”\r\n\r\nOn the 13th January they reached Bilma, famous for its salt pans, and\r\non February 4th the discomforts they had endured in the desert received\r\nample compensation by a view of “the great Lake Chad, glowing with the\r\ngolden rays of the sun in its strength.” The natural emotion of the\r\ntravellers is thus expressed by Denham, whose descriptions in the general\r\nway certainly do not incline to the picturesque:\r\n\r\n    “It conveyed to my mind,” he writes, “a sensation so gratifying\r\n    and inspiring that it would be difficult for language to convey\r\n    an idea of its force and pleasure.... My heart bounded within\r\n    me at the prospect, for I believe this lake to be the key to\r\n    the great object of our search, and I could not refrain from\r\n    silently imploring heaven’s continued protection, which had\r\n    enabled us to proceed so far in health and strength, even to\r\n    the accomplishment of our task.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE DISCOVERY OF NORTHERN NIGERIA—(_cont._)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the borders of the Lake the travellers observed the cotton shrub\r\ngrowing well and innumerable flocks of waterfowl disporting themselves.\r\nSo tame were the latter that when approached they “merely changed their\r\nposition a little to the right or left.” Following the Western shore of\r\nthe Chad, the travellers pushed on to Kuka. Within a few days’ march\r\nof that once-flourishing city they began to realise how erroneous were\r\nthe popular ideas of the “Sudan.” Instead of “ragged negroes armed with\r\nspears,” who, with the assistance of a few Arabs, managed to terrorise\r\nthe country, the travellers were astonished to see a dense cloud of\r\ncavalry riding towards them, the guard of honour sent by the Sheik of\r\nBornu to bid them welcome. With loud cries of “Blessing, blessing!\r\nWelcome! welcome!” the black warriors, clad “in coats of mail, composed\r\nof iron chain,” bore down upon them in orderly array, waving swords and\r\nspears. Surrounded by this imposing mass of horsemen they entered Kuka,\r\nand were received in audience by the Sheik. After a short residence in\r\nKuka the companions separated, Denham going off with Bu-Kalum on the raid\r\nwhich turned out so disastrously for all concerned in it.\r\n\r\nThe energetic Major subsequently visited a large portion of the Eastern\r\nparts of Bornu, located and ascended the Shari as far as Logon, then the\r\ncapital of an important kingdom, and explored a considerable portion\r\nof the Eastern shores of the Lake. The information he collected in the\r\ncourse of his peregrinations and the maps of the district which he\r\ncompiled were of very great value. The Southern and Eastern shores of\r\nthe Lake were entirely unknown, the Lake itself practically unlocated,\r\nand the existence of the Shari unsuspected. It has always appeared to\r\nme that Denham never received the credit which was due to him for his\r\nexploring work. In view of his unscientific training, he was unable to\r\nturn his discoveries to the best advantage, but all things considered,\r\nhis investigations proved in the main surprisingly accurate. His\r\nignorance of African history, too, was very much against him. He was\r\ndistinctly an unlettered man, neither possessed of a ready pen nor\r\nimbued with much imagination. The natural result of these shortcomings\r\nis apparent in every page of his Journal. We find him recording the\r\nmost trivial incidents, and almost neglecting the social, political and\r\nethnological problems with which he came daily in contact. The same lack\r\nof study and intelligent research—of education, really—is visible, but\r\nperhaps to a lesser extent, in Clapperton’s writings.\r\n\r\nIt was in a sense a new world which the explorers had entered, a\r\nworld of absorbing interest, where Eastern magnificence and barbaric\r\ndisplay mingled with the naked barbarism of Africa; where semi-Arabised\r\npotentates went a-warring with mail-clad knights, and powerful Barons\r\nbrought their contingent of retainers to assist their liege lord\r\nin his campaigns of plunder and conquest. The travellers had left\r\nnineteenth-century England, had plunged into the Desert, and had emerged\r\ntherefrom amid a feudalism which recalled in many ways that of their own\r\nland in the Middle Ages. What an opportunity was theirs in this region,\r\nwhich for centuries, by reason of its fertility, had proved a magnet\r\nto attract the migration of races from the North, West, and East! Some\r\ntwenty years later a man with a truly scientific mind went over the same\r\nground, and then, and only then, did people realise all that Denham and\r\nClapperton had left untold. But, although it was reserved for the genial\r\nand cultured German who succeeded Denham to show how profound is the gulf\r\nbetween a character such as Barth’s, studious and observant, replete\r\nwith historical lore and scientific attainment, and men like Denham and\r\nClapperton, notable only for their courage, dogged perseverance, and\r\nlove of adventure, yet the prestige of the former, which increases rather\r\nthan diminishes as our knowledge of these regions in question becomes\r\nmore extensive, can never rob the Englishmen of the right of priority of\r\ndiscovery. They were the first white men to reach the Chad, to discover\r\nthe Shari, to explore Bornu, Sokoto, and part of Kanem, and to describe,\r\nhowever indifferently, the wonderful social fabric, the picturesque\r\ncivilisation, teeming with energy and industrialism, which existed, and\r\nexists, in the upper portion of the Niger Basin.\r\n\r\nWhile Denham bent his steps eastwards, Clapperton and Oudney left Kuka\r\nin a westerly direction with the intention of entering the Empire\r\nof Sokoto, founded by Othman Fodio (the Fulani reformer during the\r\nfirst years of the nineteenth century) out of the heterogeneous and\r\nmutually antagonistic Hausa States. Of this Empire and the remarkable\r\nrace which created it, the travellers had heard a great deal while in\r\nBornu. The two States were for the time being at peace, and the Sheik\r\nMohammed-el-Kanemy, the virtual, and subsequently the absolute ruler\r\nof Bornu, made no opposition to the Englishmen’s visit. Shortly after\r\nleaving Katagum, at the small village of Murmur, Dr. Oudney, who had\r\nbeen ailing for many months, died, much to Clapperton’s distress. The\r\nsad event did not, however, deter his companion from pushing onwards,\r\nnoting as he went the extraordinary beauty and fertility of the country,\r\nthe numerous plantations of cotton, tobacco and indigo, the rows upon\r\nrows of date-palms, the splendid cattle, the luxurious foliage, and the\r\nindustry of the inhabitants, tending their flocks and herds, toiling in\r\nthe fields, carrying fruit and butter to the markets, weaving and dyeing\r\ntheir handsome cotton cloths. On January 19, 1824, Clapperton reached\r\nKano, the great Emporium of the Central Sudan, his first feeling being\r\none of disappointment, which was not diminished by the circumstance that,\r\nalthough he had donned his naval uniform, no one took the slightest\r\nheed of him, “but all intent on their own business, allowed me to pass\r\nby without remark.” This little incident, trivial in itself, throws an\r\ninteresting sidelight upon the character of the gallant sailor, who was\r\nimbued with a proper sense of the dignity befitting his position and\r\nnever failed to uphold it, as witness the following conversation which\r\ntook place between him and the Governor of Kano. There is, by the way, a\r\npassage in this short dialogue which may be commended to the attention of\r\ncertain missionary enthusiasts at the present time:\r\n\r\n    “‘How do you do, Abdullah (Clapperton’s native name)? Will you\r\n    come and see me at Hadyja on your return?’ I answered, ‘God\r\n    willing,’ with due Moslem solemnity. ‘You are a Christian,\r\n    Abdullah?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘And what have you come to see?’ ‘The\r\n    country.’ ‘What do you think of it?’ ‘It is a fine country,\r\n    but very sickly.’ At this he smiled, and again asked, ‘Would\r\n    you Christians allow us to come and see your country?’ I said,\r\n    ‘Certainly.’ ‘Would you force us to become Christians?’ ‘By no\r\n    means; we never meddle with a man’s religion.’ ‘What,’ said he,\r\n    ‘and do you ever pray?’ ‘Sometimes; our religion commands us to\r\n    pray always; but we pray in secret, and not in public, except\r\n    on Sundays.’ One of his people abruptly asked what a Christian\r\n    was? ‘Why a Kaffir,’[28] rejoined the Governor. ‘Where is your\r\n    Jew servant?’ again asked the Governor; ‘you ought to let me\r\n    see him.’ ‘Excuse me, he is averse to it, and I never allow my\r\n    servants to be molested for their religious opinions.’ ‘Well,\r\n    Abdullah, thou art a man of understanding, and you must come\r\n    and see me at Hadyja.’”\r\n\r\nClapperton came very satisfactorily out of that interview, but he did not\r\nfare quite so well in a later colloquy with Sultan Bello, the ruler of\r\nthe Sokoto Empire, who asked him one day whether he was a Nestorian or a\r\nSocinian. The puzzled Englishman, who probably had never heard of either\r\nsect, excused himself by replying that he was a Protestant. The fact of\r\nhaving such a question put to him thousands of miles in the interior of\r\nthe Dark Continent, supposed to be the abode of primitive savagery, was\r\nsufficient evidence of the intelligence of the inhabitants, of which\r\nhe received abundant proof every fresh day he prolonged his stay in\r\nthe country. Under the able guidance of Bello, Othman’s successor and\r\n“a noble-looking man,” as Clapperton calls him (with the aristocratic\r\nand finely cut features peculiar to the Fulani), the statesmanlike\r\nqualities of the ruling race and the wonderful commercial and industrial\r\nactivity of the Hausa population, reached their full development,\r\nand law and order reigned throughout that portion of the new States\r\nwhich had accepted the Fulani dominion. The country had been divided\r\ninto Provinces, to each of which Governors were appointed. Trade was\r\nencouraged, industries protected, and manufactures promoted. Prosperity\r\nwas everywhere apparent, and, to quote the words used by Clapperton in\r\nthe course of one of his interviews with Bello:\r\n\r\n    “The people of England could all read and write, and were\r\n    acquainted with most other regions of the earth; but of this\r\n    country alone they hitherto knew scarcely anything, and\r\n    erroneously regarded the inhabitants as naked savages, devoid\r\n    of religion, and not far removed from the condition of wild\r\n    beasts; whereas, I found them, from my personal observation, to\r\n    be civilised, humane, and pious.”\r\n\r\nClapperton very much desired to continue his westward journey, and, if\r\npossible, strike the Niger, follow it to its mouth, and thus attain the\r\nsupreme object of the mission; for the information which the traveller\r\nhad obtained in Sokoto made it a practical certainty that the Niger\r\ndischarged itself somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. But Bello objected,\r\nalleging the disturbed condition of the westward country, which had not\r\nyet been subjected. Much to his disappointment, therefore, the Englishman\r\nwas compelled to forego his plans. He, however, parted on the best of\r\nterms with his enlightened host, who gave him a letter to the King of\r\nEngland, and begged him to return at the earliest possible opportunity.\r\nThe letter is worth reproducing here:\r\n\r\n                    “BELLO TO KING GEORGE IV.\r\n\r\n    “In the name of God, the merciful and the clement. May God\r\n    bless our favourite prophet Mahommed and those who follow\r\n    his sound doctrine. To the head of the Christian nation, the\r\n    honoured and the beloved among the English people, George\r\n    the Fourth, King of Great Britain. Praise be to God who\r\n    inspires, and peace be unto those who follow the right path.\r\n    Your Majesty’s servant, Rayes Abdullah, came to us, and we\r\n    found him a very intelligent and wise man; representing in\r\n    every respect your greatness, wisdom, dignity, clemency, and\r\n    penetration. When the time of his departure came he requested\r\n    us to form a friendly relation and correspond with you, and to\r\n    prohibit the exportation of slaves by our merchants to Ataghar,\r\n    Dahomi, and Ashanti. We agree with him upon this, on account\r\n    of the good which will result from it both to you and to us;\r\n    and that a vessel of yours is to come to the harbour of Racka,\r\n    with two guns and the quantities of powder, shot, &c., which\r\n    they require; as also a number of muskets. We will then send\r\n    our officer to arrange to settle everything with your consul,\r\n    and fix a certain period for the arrival of your merchant\r\n    ships, and when they come they may traffic and deal with our\r\n    merchants. Then, after their return, the consul may reside in\r\n    that harbour, viz., Racka, as protector, in company with our\r\n    agent there. May God be pleased. Dated, 1st of Rhamadan, 1239\r\n    of Hejra. April 18, 1824.”\r\n\r\nFurnished with this letter, which he might well regard as a signal proof\r\nof success, and which augured a promising development of relations in\r\nthe future, Clapperton travelled back to Kuka, where Denham joined him\r\nin due course, after his return from the Chad. The homeward journey was\r\naccomplished without mishap, and on January 25, 1825, the survivors of\r\nthe mission reached Tripoli, after four adventurous years, replete with\r\ninterest to their country and to the world.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, Clapperton, when he parted company with Sultan Bello,\r\ndid so with the full intention of returning at the earliest opportunity.\r\nBello had shown himself most eager to establish durable relations with\r\nGreat Britain, and had suggested that a British vessel should go to\r\n“Racka,” there to deliver the warlike stores which were to cement the\r\nunderstanding between his Christian Majesty King George IV. and the\r\nFulani Ruler. Clapperton found the British Government eager to profit\r\nby the opportunity of concluding an alliance with so influential a\r\npotentate, and lost no time in giving Clapperton (who was raised to the\r\nrank of commander) authority to organise another expedition. Clapperton\r\nhimself was all enthusiasm. On the 27th August 1825 he left England in\r\nH.M.S. _Brazen_, in company with his trusted servant, Richard Lander,\r\nand attended by three companions, Mr. Dickson, Captain Pearce, and Dr.\r\nMorrison. Dickson, for some unexplained reason, landed at Whydah with\r\nthe intention of reaching Sokoto alone, and was never heard of again.\r\nDisappointed at not meeting any of Bello’s messengers at Lagos, which\r\nit appears had been arranged, Clapperton started his inland march from\r\nBadagry, after trying the Benin route and being dissuaded from adopting\r\nit by an English merchant established in that river. Shortly afterwards\r\nboth Captain Pearce and Dr. Morrison contracted fever and died.\r\nClapperton and Lander pushed safely onwards through Yoruba and Borgu, and\r\narrived without further calamity at Bussa. The river was crossed below\r\nthe rapids, and the expedition duly reached Kano by way of Zeg-Zeg. At\r\nBussa, Clapperton gathered valuable information with regard to Park’s\r\nuntimely end, fully confirming the previous information which had reached\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nEverything seemed to promise well for the ultimate success of the\r\nmission. Unfortunately, however, there were a number of causes at work\r\ndestined to wreck the sanguine hopes of its leader. As Clapperton neared\r\nhis destination, a doubt of the reception awaiting him at Sokoto appears\r\nto have weighed heavily upon his mind. In the first place, Bello’s\r\nmessengers had not put in appearance at Lagos; then the seaport of\r\n“Racka,” mentioned in Bello’s map, did not exist as such, which latter\r\ncircumstance caused Clapperton to entertain serious misgivings as to\r\nhis former host’s good faith. The absence of the messengers can easily\r\nbe explained in view of the disturbed state of the country between\r\nYoruba and the Niger, for the Fulani were then extending their conquests\r\nsouthwards, and the entire region was in a state of effervescence; but\r\nthe misunderstanding about “Racka” is certainly strange. It is difficult\r\nto believe that Bello purposely intended to mislead. Bello had spoken\r\nof the “harbour” of Racka, but as is pointed out in the introduction to\r\nClapperton’s journal, the Arabic word Bahr, used in the manuscript, does\r\nnot necessarily signify sea, but any collection of water, whether lake\r\nor river.[29] On Bello’s map the Niger is designated as the “sea.” It\r\nis probable, therefore, that Bello was perfectly honest in describing\r\n“Racka” as a “harbour,” and that the _bahr_ of the manuscript should\r\nmore correctly have been translated by “river” instead of “sea.” Racka,\r\nhowever, turned out to be an inland town, and the fact strengthened\r\nClapperton’s suspicions. How the confusion arose it is impossible, on the\r\ndocumentary evidence available, to determine, but it seems obvious that\r\nRacka must have been meant for Rabba, an important town on the banks of\r\nthe Niger, some distance below Bussa, and at one time the capital of the\r\nkingdom of Nupe.\r\n\r\nTo this error of interpretation and geography was really due Clapperton’s\r\nsubsequent misfortunes, because, had the suspicion that Bello was\r\nplaying him false been absent from his mind, the intrepid Englishman\r\nwould hardly have adopted the unwise attitude which he subsequently did\r\nin his negotiations with the Fulani monarch. That attitude proved his\r\nundoing, and the direct cause of his death. His mental condition did not\r\nenable him to grasp the fact that the entire state of affairs had changed\r\nsince his first visit. Sokoto was then at peace with Bornu. But in the\r\ninterval war had broken out again. Now, in addition to the presents that\r\nClapperton had brought to Bello, his baggage also contained a number of\r\npresents, including war-stores, for the Sheik-el-Kanemy, ruler of Bornu,\r\nwho had become Bello’s deadly enemy. It was manifestly impossible for\r\nBello to allow these presents to pass through the country at such a time,\r\nand he wrote to Clapperton to that effect. To this Clapperton rejoined\r\nthat he had been instructed by his Government to go to Bornu, that he\r\nhad a letter from Earl Bathurst to the Sheik-el-Kanemy, and that he was\r\nin duty bound to carry out his mandate. This insistence aroused Bello’s\r\nmistrust, which seems to have been intensified by reports, doubtless\r\nspread through the instrumentality of Arab merchants dreading commercial\r\ncompetition, that Clapperton was a spy sent on behalf of the English\r\nGovernment to obtain information with the idea of facilitating a future\r\ninvasion of the country by the British. Clapperton repeatedly, and with\r\ngrowing exasperation, pressed his wishes upon the Sultan, and Bello, with\r\nincreasing distrust, as repeatedly declined to entertain them. The strain\r\nand the mortification were too great, even for Clapperton’s splendid\r\nconstitution, and when Bello, yielding to his own suspicions, and to\r\nthe advice of his counsellors, demanded the production of the presents\r\nintended for the Sheik, Clapperton fell seriously ill. After hovering\r\nbetween life and death for many days, he finally expired in the arms of\r\nhis devoted servant, Lander.\r\n\r\nThus terminated a career of unbounding usefulness. To England and to\r\nscience Clapperton rendered great services, and had his intellectual\r\ncapacity equalled his courage and determination, those services would\r\nhave been even greater than they were. Of him we may truly say that he\r\nwas a fine type of the English gentleman of the old school, without\r\nmuch erudition, but simple, God-fearing, honest, manly, a credit to his\r\ncountry and to his race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE HAUSAS AND THEIR EMPORIUM.\r\n\r\n    “The province of Kano is the garden of Central Africa.”—Dr.\r\n    BARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been said of the Hausas that they are “superior both\r\nintellectually and physically to all the natives of Equatorial Africa.”\r\nThe statement strikes one as being exaggerated. The intellectual average\r\nof the Hausa is undoubtedly lower than that of the Fulani, who, thanks to\r\ntheir genius for combination, administrative capacity, religious fervour,\r\nfighting superiority, and moral influence, completely defeated and\r\nsubdued their former masters, although the numerical odds were greatly in\r\nfavour of the latter. Again, the physique of the Hausas, though usually\r\ngood, is certainly inferior to that of several of the Senegalese races,\r\nthe Krus, the Kaffir stock, and probably also to one or two of the Bantu\r\noffshoots now inhabiting the basin of the Upper Congo. Much has been made\r\nof the fact that 500 Hausas trained by British officers beat off several\r\nthousand Fulani at Bida. But what chance have Fulani horsemen against\r\nMaxim guns and repeating-rifles? The Baggara Arab, universally reputed\r\nthe bravest of the brave, fared no better against Macdonald’s trained\r\nSudanese.\r\n\r\nThese remarks are by no means put forward to depreciate the Hausa race,\r\nwhich is undoubtedly a very fine one, but by way of protest against the\r\nsomewhat hysterical estimates concerning this people which find favour\r\namong those who profess to look upon them as excellent material for\r\nproselytising purposes, and are ever representing them to us as cruelly\r\noppressed, groaning under the tyrannical sway of the wicked Fulani. The\r\nfact is, that a great deal of sentimental nonsense has been said and\r\nwritten, principally by the missionary element, about the Hausas, who\r\nare generally content with their lot, and having accepted Islam do not\r\nsuffer from the predatory incursions of the conquering race. Fulani and\r\nHausas grow up side by side: unions are frequent among them, and the\r\nwell-to-do Hausa enjoys a somewhat similar position in relation to the\r\nruling class as represented by the Fulani, as did the merchant classes in\r\nthe old days in our own country in relation to the nobility and governing\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nIt seems fairly well established that at least a portion of the Hausa[30]\r\nrace inhabited the beautiful and mountainous region of Air or Asben, at\r\nthe time (about 700 A.D.) when the Berbers—the modern Tuareg—driven south\r\nby Arab invaders, crossed the desert into Air and made themselves masters\r\nof that region.[31] These Asben Hausas belonged to the family or clan of\r\nGober. They were the Goberawa, who claim to be the oldest and noblest\r\nbranch of the Hausa race. This claim is very generally admitted by Arabic\r\nhistorians, and is expressly mentioned in the curious Fulani history\r\nof the Sudan communicated to Clapperton by Sultan Bello, son of Othman\r\nFodio, in 1828.[32] Bello says of the people of Gober that they are “free\r\nborn, because their origin was from the Copts of Egypt who had emigrated\r\ninto the interior of the Gharb or Western countries.” This statement\r\nis particularly interesting as regards the possible Semitic or Eastern\r\norigin of the Gober family of the Hausas. Dr. Barth, whose authority in\r\nall matters relating to the ethnology of Western Central Africa still\r\nremains uncontested, although fifty years have now elapsed since his\r\nwonderful series of travels was accomplished, attributed to the Goberawa\r\nan original relationship with North Africa. The theory is borne out by\r\nthe traditions of the Hausas themselves, who trace back their descent\r\nto a Diggera mother, the Diggera or Deggara being a Berber tribe which,\r\nat some remote period, was predominant in the city of Daura, one of the\r\noldest centres of Hausa influence. To this day some of the Hausa Mallams\r\nspeak vaguely of a former relationship with the East, and Canon Robinson\r\nduring his stay in Kano was informed by “the most learned man in that\r\ncity” that the Hausas migrated in early times from the Far East, beyond\r\nMecca.[33] It is much to be deplored in this connection that the national\r\nrecords of the Hausas should have been destroyed by the Fulani at the\r\ntaking of Katsena. Nevertheless, we may reasonably hope, now that the\r\nrelations of Northern Nigeria with the outside world are bound to become\r\nmore frequent, some further light may be shortly forthcoming which will\r\nhelp to elucidate a problem fraught with great attraction to all students\r\nof West Africa.\r\n\r\nAfter their expulsion from Air by the inflowing tide of Berber\r\nimmigration, the Hausas gradually spread west and south, and in course\r\nof time formed themselves into seven states, viz. Gober, Daura, Biram,\r\nKano, Rano, Katsena and Zeg-Zeg.[34] In Hausa mythology each of these\r\nStates represented one of the seven legitimate children, offspring of\r\nthe Diggera mother already alluded to, to each of whom was respectively\r\ngiven a task to perform. Thus Gober was the warrior _serki-n-yaki_\r\n(_serki_, Prince: _n_, of: _yaki_, fighting); Kano and Rano the dyers\r\n_saraki-n-baba_ (from the abundance of indigo _marinas_ or dyeing\r\npits which represent one of the most considerable national industries\r\nof the Hausas); Katsena and Daura the traders _saraki-n-Kaswa_, and\r\nZeg-Zeg the purveyor of slaves _serki-n-bay_ which, by the way, affords\r\nincidental proof, if any were needed, that in the matter of slavery the\r\nHausas can hardly claim superior moral characteristics over their Fulani\r\nconquerors. Disputes between these various States were frequent, and\r\nalthough peopled by the same race, they were constantly in open warfare\r\nagainst one another. So great, indeed, was their mutual antagonism, that\r\nwhen the Fulani uprising took place in Gober, a considerable number of\r\nHausas, principally from the province of Zanfara, rallied round Othman’s\r\nstandard, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Fulani against their own\r\ncompatriots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PURE-BRED KANO MAN (HAUSA)]\r\n\r\nPrior to their more or less forced conversion by the Fulani early in\r\nthe nineteenth century, the Hausas were Pagans. True, the Hausa King\r\nof Katsena embraced Islam about the seventeenth century, Katsena at\r\nthat period being the most flourishing city of Hausa—the “Florence of\r\nthe Hausas,” as Richardson[35] calls it—in regular communication with\r\nArabs from the East, and where the Hausa language attained its greatest\r\nrichness and purity of form. But the great mass of the Hausa people were\r\nunaffected by the event. The precise nature of their rites before the\r\nconquest remains obscure. It appears possible however that, at one time,\r\nthe Hausas, Songhays, and other tribes of the Niger Basin were snake\r\nworshippers. The Arabic historians Ahmed-Baba, Edrizi and El-Bekri state\r\nthat in the time of the first Songhay king—placed at 679 A.D. by Dr.\r\nBarth, at 776 A.D. by others—the natives rendered homage to serpents.\r\nColonel Frey,[36] in his interesting and ingenious study, suggests that\r\nthis worship may have extended to the _manatus_ or _manatee_, that\r\ncurious and somewhat uncanny creature being an inhabitant of the Niger\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, with the dawn of the nineteenth century a higher\r\nideal and a purer faith rose up in Hausaland, and gained ground with\r\nmarvellous rapidity. No doubt the result was not obtained without\r\nbloodshed, without cruelty, without what Joseph Thompson called “the\r\nterrible clamour and dread accompaniments of war.” Nevertheless, it was\r\naccomplished, and none but the wholly fanatical will deny that the Hausas\r\nhave greatly benefited thereby. To an unbiased mind it must appeal as\r\nlittle short of marvellous that, in a period comparatively so short,\r\na whole race should not only have been converted to Islam, but have\r\nremained devoted to its precepts when a lapse into Paganism would have\r\nbeen easy and, in a sense, natural. Apart from the added dignity which\r\nthe acceptance of Islam imparts to individuals in their intercourse with\r\ntheir fellows in a pagan country, the explanation is probably to be found\r\nin the fact that, after the Fulani had unquestionably established their\r\npolitical domination over the Hausas, they none the less persistently\r\ncontinued their religious propaganda by peaceful means, and that,\r\nalthough a sense of security seems to have temporarily dulled their\r\npolitical instincts, it has had, on the contrary, a vivifying effect upon\r\ntheir religious ideals. It is, in any case, notorious that Islam, through\r\nthe medium of Fulani preachers, is steadily sweeping down the River\r\nNiger, penetrating into pagan villages, amid the swamps and forests. The\r\npagan Igarras whom the Niger Company long thought would constitute a\r\nsolid bulwark and a sort of buffer-state against the invading tide, are\r\nnow being fast won over to Islam, and Fulani _fikis_ are even met with\r\nbehind Akassa, a few miles from the seaboard itself.\r\n\r\nIt is no easy matter to correctly estimate the Hausa population in\r\nNigeria, but of true Hausas there must probably be five or six millions,\r\nbesides the numerous half-breeds of mixed Hausa and Fulani, Hausa and\r\nKanuri, Hausa and Songhay, or Hausa and Tuareg blood, the latter of whom\r\nare chiefly to be met with in the northerly districts of the Sokoto\r\nEmpire, and are of less muscular build than the true Hausas. The Hausas\r\nare incontestably the traders of Africa. Their commercial aptitude is\r\nrenowned from the borders of the Mediterranean to the Gulf of Guinea;\r\nfrom the Gulf of Guinea to the Shari; from the Shari to the Red Sea.\r\nThey are great travellers and have even been met with on the Sangha,\r\nthe Ubanghi, and the Congo. Every North African port has its colony of\r\nHausas. The same may be said of the West African Coast ports. There is\r\nnot an important trading centre in the Niger bend but shelters a family\r\nor two of Hausas. Every year numerous Hausa caravans leave Nigeria for\r\nthe countries lying at the back of the Gold Coast, the Ivory Coast,\r\nand Liberia, to gather the far-famed Kola or _guro_ nut, the fruit of\r\n_Sterculia acuminata_, which they convey with infinite care—delicately\r\nwrapped in leaves—and sell at an enormous profit in Kano, Gando, Zaria,\r\n&c., from whence the nuts are again transported to Bornu, Wadai, and even\r\nas far as Khartoum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HAUSA FROM YOLA]\r\n\r\nIf the trading instincts of the Hausas are remarkably developed, their\r\nindustrial enterprise is still more so. It may with safety be declared\r\nthat the product of their looms and dye-pits constitutes the most\r\nextensive article in the internal commerce of the Dark Continent. Kano\r\nis the head and centre of this intrinsically native industry, which\r\nis unparalleled in Africa, and Kano is, and in all human probability\r\nwill continue to be, Manchester’s great rival for the African interior\r\nmarkets. Kano has been termed the Manchester and Birmingham of the\r\nSudan, and having due regard to local circumstances and conditions, the\r\ncomparison is strictly just.\r\n\r\nThe number of Europeans who have visited Kano may still be counted upon\r\nthe fingers of both hands. Arab merchants from North and East Africa\r\nhave, however, been regular frequenters of the city since the conquest\r\nof Hausa by Othman Fodio, and for some considerable time past Kano\r\nhas sheltered an Arab Colony with a recognised “Consul” who enjoys\r\nconsiderable influence. Its resident population has been variously\r\nestimated at thirty thousand to sixty thousand and its floating\r\npopulation at sixty thousand to two millions,[37] including the most\r\nvaried elements, Hausas, Fulani, Kanuri, Baghirmis, Wadaiens, Arabs,\r\nTuaregs, and Jews; merchants from Egypt, Tunis, Tripoli and Fezzan,\r\nfrom the Niger Bend, Adamawa and the Eastern Sudan. The city itself is\r\nof enormous extent, containing within its encompassing wall, which is\r\nreputed to be no less than fifteen miles in circumference, large tracts\r\nof land under cultivation. This immense wall played an important part\r\nin the periodic wars with Bornu at the beginning and middle of the past\r\ncentury. If the citizens of Kano did not think themselves sufficiently\r\nstrong to meet their aggressors in the open, they simply shut the\r\ngates of the city and lined the walls, and the Bornuese hosts, deeming\r\ndiscretion the better part of valour, never attempted an assault. The\r\nsituation of Kano is fairly elevated and otherwise good, but is unhealthy\r\nowing to the presence of large pools of stagnant water into which refuse\r\nof all kinds is indiscriminately pitched. The city is divided into\r\ndifferent quarters, the Fulani quarter, Arab quarter, Hausa quarter, and\r\nso forth. The market is held daily and the most bewildering diversity of\r\narticles are always on sale: native cloths, silk embroidered _tobes_,\r\nleather and brass ware, ivory, weapons, rough agricultural implements,\r\nsilver and brass ornaments and trinkets, antimony, ostrich feathers,\r\nlive stock—cattle, horses and sheep—and foodstuffs innumerable. Long\r\nfiles of asses pass through from the distant Chad laden with natron for\r\nNupe, and arrive from the Niger Bend weighed down with kolas. Camels\r\nare permanently in evidence, whether carrying on their sturdy backs\r\nsalt-cakes from Bilma or European merchandise from Tripoli. Brilliantly\r\nattired Ghadamseen and Arab traders caracole on gaily caparisoned steeds,\r\nand the fierce-eyed, black-lithamed Tuareg of the desert (many of whom,\r\nby the way, are extensive property owners in Northern Nigeria) scowls\r\ndarkly from the back of his swift-footed _mehari_. In this great city\r\nthrobs and vibrates an industrial vitality unequalled in Africa.[38]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE HAUSAS AND THEIR EMPORIUM—(_cont._)\r\n\r\n    “Travellers who have been in the country tell us that Kano,\r\n    which is the Manchester of Nigeria, has an attendance annually\r\n    at its market of over one million persons.”—_Extract from a\r\n    speech by_ Mr. CHAMBERLAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reputation of Kano as a manufacturing city is of comparatively\r\nrecent growth, and although the Hausas have manufactured cotton for a\r\nconsiderable time (how long is uncertain, but we do know that their\r\nleather-ware[39] was widely sought after as far back as the beginning\r\nof the sixteenth century), the importance of Kano as a trading and\r\nmanufacturing emporium only dates from the Fulani conquest and the\r\ndestruction of Katsena by Bello. The Hausa cottons of Kano are in demand\r\nthroughout the whole of the Islamic world of North, West, and central\r\nAfrica. Lieutenant-Colonel Monteil, one of the few Europeans who have\r\nvisited Kano, gives it as his opinion that the inhabitants of two-thirds\r\nof the Sudan, and nearly all the inhabitants of the Central and Eastern\r\nSahara, clothe themselves in Kano cottons; while Dr. Barth estimated the\r\nannual export of cotton from Kano to Timbuctoo alone to amount in value\r\nto some £5000. The principal cotton articles manufactured by the Hausas\r\nat Kano are the _Tobe_ or shirt for men; the _Turkedi_ or women’s dress;\r\nthe _Zenne_ or plaid; and the black veil or litham invariably worn by\r\nthe Tuareg and very often by the Fulani, Kanuri, and Arab. The _tobes_\r\nare dyed various colours, while the _turkedi_ are always of that deep,\r\ndark blue obtained by repeated washings in indigo-pits for which the\r\nprovince of Kano is famous. Of the plaids a large selection is produced,\r\nvarying in colour and in texture, some being composed of a mixture of\r\nsilk and cotton, others of cotton only, others again of pure silk. Dr.\r\nBarth, speaking of this cotton industry of Kano, and remarking that the\r\nProvince which produces it is also able to supply the corn necessary for\r\nthe sustenance of its population, and possesses besides splendid pasture\r\nland, says: “In fact, if we consider that this industry is not carried\r\non here as in Europe, in immense establishments, degrading man to the\r\nmeanest conditions of life, but that it gives employment and support to\r\nfamilies without compelling them to sacrifice their domestic habits,\r\nwe must presume that Kano ought to be one of the happiest countries in\r\nthe world; and so it is, so long as its Governor, too often lazy and\r\nindolent, is able to defend its inhabitants from the cupidity of their\r\nneighbours, which, of course, is constantly stimulated by the very wealth\r\nof their country.” What the lazy Fulani Governor of Barth’s days could\r\nnot do, British power can, and indeed has; and having done so, is also\r\nable to ensure that by judicious management the national, social life of\r\nthis interesting country shall continue in that state of happiness which\r\nstruck the great German traveller.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its cloths, Kano produces excellent leather work,\r\nprincipally sandals, sword-scabbards, riding-boots, shoes, despatch-bags,\r\nwater-bottles and saddles, and annually exports large quantities of\r\ntanned hides. The people of Kano also produce iron weapons, rough\r\nagricultural implements and sword-hilts for German blades, which are, or\r\nused to be, imported from the north. The following estimate of the total\r\ntrade of Kano, carefully compiled from Dr. Barth’s calculations, will\r\ngive some idea of its extent and value at the time (1851) of the German\r\nexplorer’s stay in the city. The sterling is arrived at by reckoning one\r\nmillion _kurdi_ or cowries—the chief currency in Kano—at £100.\r\n\r\n                           EXPORTS.\r\n\r\n    Cloths                                         £30,000\r\n    Slaves                                          20,000\r\n    Sandals                                          1,000\r\n    Miscellaneous leather-work                         500\r\n                                                   -------\r\n        Total                                      £51,500\r\n                                                   =======\r\n\r\n                            IMPORTS.\r\n\r\n    Kola nuts (from West Coast hinterlands)        £10,000\r\n    Ivory (from Adamawa)                            10,000\r\n    Salt (from the interior)                         8,000\r\n    Coarse silk (_viâ_ Tripoli)                      7,000\r\n    Arab dresses (from Tunis and Tripoli)            5,000\r\n    Beads (Italy, _viâ_ Tripoli)                     5,000\r\n    Sword-blades (from Germany, _viâ_ Tripoli)       5,000\r\n    Manchester goods (_viâ_ Tripoli)                 4,000\r\n    Muslins (England, _viâ_ Tripoli)                 4,000\r\n    Rose oil (_viâ_ Tripoli)                         5,000\r\n    Copper (from Wadai and Bahr-el-Ghazal)           2,000\r\n    Woollen cloths (_viâ_ Tripoli)                   1,500\r\n    Spices and cloves (_viâ_ Tripoli)                1,500\r\n    Sugar (from France, _viâ_ Tripoli)               1,200\r\n    Tin                                              1,000\r\n    Egyptian dresses                                 1,000\r\n    Needles (from Germany, _viâ_ Tripoli)              800\r\n    Common paper, ditto                                500\r\n    Razors (from Syria)                                300\r\n                                                   -------\r\n        Total                                      £71,800\r\n                                                   =======\r\n\r\nTo which might be added a transit trade in natron, passing through Kano\r\nfrom Bornu on its way to Nupe, yielding about £1000 “passage-money.” The\r\nremarkable total of £123,300 is thus arrived at.\r\n\r\nOf late years the trade of Kano, both in respect to imports and exports,\r\nhas undergone some change, and is bound to become still more modified\r\nas time goes on. For instance, the buying and selling of slaves is a\r\nthing of the past, or soon will be. The imports of ivory from Adamawa\r\nare nothing like what they were in Barth’s time. The internal salt\r\ntrade has largely been extinguished, the native article being unable to\r\ncompete with European salt. But with this exception—salt—the increased\r\nimportation of European goods into the Niger and Binue since 1880, that\r\nis to say, since the spread of British commercial enterprise in the\r\nUpper River and its tributary, does not appear to have affected the\r\ncaravan trade of Kano with the Tripolitan ports, _viâ_ the oases of\r\nBilma, Fezzan, and Murzuk. In 1897, for instance, the British Consul for\r\nTripoli estimated the goods sent to Sokoto (for Sokoto read the State\r\nof Sokoto, of which the city of Kano is the commercial and industrial\r\ncentre and the terminus of the Tripoli caravans, the trade of the city\r\nof Sokoto being insignificant) by caravan across the desert at £46,000.\r\nThese figures compared with Barth’s tables of Tripoli imported goods are\r\nactually more considerable than the total value as estimated by Barth\r\nhalf a century ago. This is a very important fact, and by bearing it well\r\nin mind we shall avoid falling into an error which might have unfortunate\r\nconsequences. Then, again, a comparison of the articles imported in 1851\r\nand 1897 is instructive as affording proof of the conservatism of the\r\nAfrican and the old-established nature of this trade.\r\n\r\n                 DR. BARTH’S ENUMERATION, 1851.\r\n\r\n    Coarse silk, Arab dresses, sword-blades, Manchester goods,\r\n    muslins, rose oil, woollen cloths, sugar, spices and cloves,\r\n    needles, paper.\r\n\r\n                   FOREIGN OFFICE REPORT, 1897.\r\n\r\n    Cotton and woollen cloths, silk waste, silk yarn, box rings,\r\n    beads, amber, paper, sugar, drugs, tea.\r\n\r\nWe may go even farther back than this. According to the exceedingly\r\ninteresting and minute accounts of “Shereef Imhammed” and “Ben Ali, a\r\nMoorish trader,” given in the first published proceedings of the African\r\nAssociation in 1791, the trade between Tripoli and the Kingdom of\r\n“Cashna,” _i.e._ Katsena (Katsena being then in its prime), consisted of\r\nthe following articles:\r\n\r\n                 IMPORTS TO KATSENA FROM TRIPOLI.\r\n\r\n    Red woollen caps, check linens, light coarse woollen cloths,\r\n    baiza, cowries, barakans or alhaiks, small Turkey carpets, silk\r\n    (wrought and unwrought), tissues and brocades, sabre-blades,\r\n    Dutch knives, scissors, coral beads, small looking-glasses.\r\n\r\n                 EXPORTS FROM KATSENA TO TRIPOLI.\r\n\r\n    Cotton cloths, slaves, goatskins “of the red and yellow dyes,”\r\n    ox and buffalo hides, gold dust, civet.\r\n\r\nThe “slaves” item is another proof that the Hausa Kings of those days\r\nwere extensive slave dealers. It is curious to notice that in the map\r\nattached to this old work, a reproduction of which faces page 38, Kano\r\ndoes not even appear, which shows that at that period it had little or no\r\nimportance as an industrial centre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAUSA LOOM AND SPOOL]\r\n\r\nThe articles imported in 1897 were, therefore, substantially the same as\r\nin 1851 and even in 1791. Then as now, English cotton and woollen goods\r\nfigured prominently amongst them, and it is evident that up to 1897 large\r\nprofits were to be earned by Europeans (indirectly) and Arabs (directly)\r\nin the caravan business between North Africa and Nigeria. Seven years\r\nafter the opening in regular form of the Western fluvial route, Northern\r\nNigeria is seen to have been importing from Tripoli more goods than in\r\n1851.\r\n\r\nIt is not due then to commercial development from the south, but to\r\nanother reason, that the caravan traffic with Tripoli has fallen off\r\nsince 1897. That reason is to be found in the internal political\r\nconvulsions of which the Chad basin has been the scene for the last\r\neight years, and to the external political confusion brought about by\r\nthe action of European Powers, or rather of one European Power—France.\r\nWhen Rabah conquered Bornu in 1893-94, the Ghadamseen merchants suffered\r\nheavy losses through the sacking of Kuka, and trade was entirely stopped\r\nfor a time. Rabah saw his mistake, and endeavoured to remedy it by\r\nliberal promises of future support and protection. He kept his word,\r\nand trade revived. Then came the advance of the French down the Shari,\r\nfollowed by a renewed period of anarchy in Bornu, as Rabah hurriedly\r\nflung himself across the river into Baghirmi to arrest the march of the\r\ninvaders. Under Fad-el-Allah, Bornu became a cockpit of internecine\r\nstrife. With the consolidation of French influence in a portion of the\r\nChad region the merchants of the north took heart of grace once more, but\r\nthe recent pillage of sundry rich caravans by the Kanem Arabs, various\r\nconfederations of Tuareg and other adherents of the Sheik-Senussi, has\r\ndemonstrated that at present the French are unable to ensure the safety\r\nof caravans, however desirous they may be to do so. These repeated\r\nblows have played havoc with the Nigerian-Tripoli caravan trade, and\r\nthose merchants who are still bold enough to face the risks favour the\r\nWadai route. In 1900 the caravan trade with Wadai was still important,\r\namounting in the aggregate, according to the French Consul at Tripoli, to\r\n£210,000, imports and exports included. But it is quite certain that 1901\r\nand 1902 will show a notable decrease of those figures.[40]\r\n\r\nAre we to conclude, therefore, that Kano’s internal trade with the\r\nnorth and east has gone never to return, and that the caravan traffic\r\nis a thing of the past? That is the view which appears to be generally\r\nadopted.[41] I confess that I do not share it, and it would certainly\r\nbe an immense misfortune for Kano and Northern Nigeria generally if such\r\nwere, indeed, the case. The main sources of Kano’s wealth and prosperity\r\ndo not depend upon the influx of trade from the south, but upon the\r\nindustry of its inhabitants in catering for the requirements not of\r\nEurope but of Africa. It is a great _dépôt_ of Negroland for Negroland,\r\nand if Kano could no longer find purchasers for her cotton and her\r\nleather work, her prosperity must needs decrease and her wealth decline.\r\nNow it is obviously in our interest that this should not happen. It\r\nshould be the object of our policy to maintain, strengthen and assist the\r\ncommercial and industrial position of Kano, the centre of Hausa activity,\r\nthe magnet which attracts a flow of internal commerce from all points of\r\nthe compass. How can that best be done?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is necessary to understand the main caravan system\r\nof North-West Central Africa. The accompanying map (facing p. 84) shows\r\nthe principal routes, and a broad survey of the subject induces the\r\nbelief that it is the interest of both England and France to encourage\r\nthe revival of the caravan traffic between Kano (or, in other words,\r\nNigeria) and Kano’s interior markets, or, at any rate, to do nothing to\r\nstill further curtail it. The wider the stream of internal trade both\r\nin and out of Nigeria the greater the prosperity of the country, and it\r\nwould be as equally pedantic for us to object if the French, who are in\r\nmore or less theoretical possession of the majority of Kano’s markets,\r\nsucceed in eventually diverting _in toto_ the caravan traffic from the\r\nTripoli route towards Timbuctoo and In Salah, as it would be for the\r\nFrench to interfere with a possible re-opening of the long-abandoned\r\neastern route (not marked in the map) towards the Nile. But there should\r\nbe an understanding between the two Powers on the subject of this\r\ninternal trade, which is centuries old, and which certainly cannot be\r\ndisplaced in a day; in fact, never can entirely be displaced, except by\r\noppressive and selfish interference, either on the part of the French or\r\nourselves. Any action tending to compel a diversion of trade in such\r\nor such a direction would prove in the long run to be anything but\r\nadvantageous to the Power which attempted it. For instance, if France\r\nwere to start putting prohibitive taxes on exports and imports to and\r\nfrom Kano over the frontier in order to forcibly confine the circulation\r\nof trade to certain channels, it would lead to serious trouble with the\r\nnatives, which would cost more to cope with than any prospective profit\r\nto be derived from such action. Similarly, if the authorities of Northern\r\nNigeria were to actively discourage Kano’s trade with the territories\r\nunder French protection, in order to develop Kano’s trade with the south,\r\nit would only lead to a decrease in the productive capacity of Kano, and\r\nconsequently lessen the prosperity of Northern Nigeria as a whole.\r\n\r\nEconomic changes are bound to occur, especially when the British and\r\nFrench railway systems proposing to tap the Niger valley are more\r\nadvanced, but there is plenty of scope for both to earn an honourable\r\nlivelihood, and the central fact to be borne in mind is that Kano’s\r\ntrade is, and must be, as previously stated, more of an internal than an\r\nexternal one. Before Kano can purchase such cottons, woollens and other\r\narticles as it absorbs, from the south, that is to say, from European\r\nmerchants, it must be in a position to give, in return, articles of\r\nAfrican produce that will pay the European merchant to buy. To suppose\r\nthat Kano will be able to do so until the iron horse has penetrated well\r\nover the Kano side of the Niger, or until a carriage-road the model of\r\nthe one the French are building from Conakry to Futa-Jallon connects\r\na navigable point on the Niger with Kano, is to cherish an illusion.\r\nTransport charges would kill any chance of profit in a transaction which\r\ndiffers in every particular from the nature of Kano’s internal trade. The\r\none would be a direct transaction, to stand or fall on its merits; the\r\nother can best be described as a multiplicity of transactions with the\r\npurchasing commodity represented by native cloth, a useless article so\r\nfar as export to Europe is concerned. In fact, it is no easy matter to\r\ndetermine how Kano will be able to feed a railway from the coast without\r\nthe creation of some great industry suitable for European export,\r\ncorresponding with the oil-palm industry of the coastwise regions. One\r\nthing at least is certain, that if through extravagance in construction\r\nand working, or other causes, the section of an eventual railway from the\r\ncoast to Kano, which passes through the oil-palm bearing regions cannot\r\nbe made to pay, the economical outlook for the railway when it leaves the\r\noil-palm zone is anything but cheerful. Of course, where the main purpose\r\nis strategic, considerations other than commercial come into play, and\r\nthe matter assumes a different aspect.\r\n\r\nTo resume, it would seem really desirable that a mutual arrangement\r\nbetween England and France should be arrived at as regards freedom\r\nof circulation for the internal traffic of the Chad region. I urged\r\nthat course in the _Pall Mall Gazette_ when the negotiations for the\r\nConvention of 1898 were pending. Recent events suggest that the proposal\r\nmight still be adopted with advantage to both parties concerned, and as\r\na measure both just and wise in the relation it bears to the legitimate\r\ninterests of the natives.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be said in this connection that the principal articles\r\nimported into the Upper Niger by the Niger Company, which up to the\r\npresent has enjoyed the monopoly of the Upper Niger trade, are salt,\r\nbrass, copper and iron rods, white damask cloths, white brocaded cloths,\r\nindigo-dyed cloths (in imitation of, but inferior to, the cloth produced\r\nfrom native looms and dyed in Kano), cowries, rice, yarn and gunpowder.\r\nThe salt which is imported chiefly from England has a large sale, being\r\ngreatly superior to native manufactured salt from Bilma and the shores\r\nof Lake Chad. The copper, brass and iron rods are chiefly used for\r\nconversion into arrow-heads. As for the cloths, they do not equal the\r\nproducts of the Kano looms, and unless of the finest white damask, are\r\nrejected by the Mohammedans. They find, however, a ready sale among\r\nthe Pagans. These cloths are, as a rule, exchanged against ivory, gum,\r\nbees-wax or rubber, bought by Hausa traders, who in turn take them to\r\nKano and there exchange them for native-made cloth.\r\n\r\nI have entered rather fully into the trading and industrial statistics\r\nof Kano because, apart from the interest naturally attaching to the\r\ncommercial life of one of the most flourishing cities of Africa, the\r\ncentre of a great industrial and agricultural district, a knowledge\r\nof these particulars enables one, I think, the better to realise what\r\nare the distinctive characteristics of the Hausa race—Kano being\r\npre-eminently Hausa. The Hausa is primarily and essentially the business\r\nman of Africa. He is not and never will become a governing personality.\r\nHis aims are commercial, and he neither seeks nor desires any other\r\nstate. Of political ambition he has none, and although strongly attached\r\nto the Mohammedan faith, and good-humouredly contemptuous of his pagan\r\ncustomers, he is quite content that they should remain pagans to the\r\nend of the chapter, willingly resigning the attractions of proselytism\r\ninto the hands of the Fulani. Withal he is a cheerful, happy-go-lucky\r\nsort of person, generally kind to his slaves, and content to gang his\r\nown gait in his own way. That is the natural state of the Hausa. If we\r\ntake him away from his business habits and fashion him into a soldier,\r\nwe perforce place him in the midst of artificial conditions of life,\r\nwhere his individuality become lost. He is then merely interesting in the\r\nsense that our other African levies are interesting, that is, from an\r\nexclusively military point of view.\r\n\r\nThe Hausa can be drilled into a good soldier, and under decent treatment\r\nwill show much patient endurance and bravery. Like all Negroes, if\r\nadequate supervision be lacking, he will take advantage of the prestige\r\nattaching to his uniform to tyrannise over the aborigines among whom he\r\nis quartered.\r\n\r\nIn his military capacity the Hausa has rendered good service in the Benin\r\nand Ashanti campaigns; in the course of innumerable skirmishes on the\r\nlower Niger, throughout the operations so admirably carried out by Sir\r\nGeorge Goldie against Nupe and Ilorin, and so on. It should, however, be\r\nremembered that on those occasions where the Hausa soldier has fought\r\nunder the British flag, he has gone into battle with the consciousness\r\nof possessing weapons which gave him an incontestable superiority over\r\nhis antagonist. He has never been called upon to face a native force\r\nofficered by Europeans, and armed with quick-firing rifles similar to\r\nhis own. His capacity to rise to the occasion if necessity demanded it\r\nneed not be queried. That is a matter upon which military men personally\r\nacquainted with the Hausa’s qualities and defects as a fighting unit are\r\nalone competent to give an opinion.[42] But until the Hausa has been put\r\nto the test, it may be well not to found too high an estimate of his\r\nmilitary abilities, bearing in mind that, unlike the French West African\r\nrecruits, he does not come of a fighting stock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAUSAS DRILLING]\r\n\r\nAs already stated, it is in his natural sphere of commerce and industry\r\nthat the Hausa shines. In that respect he stands without a rival on\r\nthe continent in which he lives. His manufacturing skill is not only\r\nremarkable for Africa: it puts Europe to the blush. For closeness,\r\ndurability and firmness of texture, the products of his looms and\r\ndye-pits eclipse anything that Manchester can produce. In a land of\r\nreputed indolence, his activity is as conspicuous as his enterprise. He\r\nmakes an ideal commercial traveller, peddling his wares over enormous\r\ndistances, and seldom failing to secure a considerable profit on his\r\ntransactions.\r\n\r\nThe Hausa has so identified himself with the commercial requirements\r\nof a vast region that his language has, throughout it, been adopted as\r\nthe necessary vehicle of inter-communication for all that appertains to\r\ntrade and commerce. The Hausa language is _per se_ specially well fitted\r\nfor extensive propagation among African races. Reclus[43] has said of\r\nit that by its fine sonorousness, the richness of its vocabulary, the\r\nsimplicity of its grammatical structure, and the graceful equilibrium of\r\nits phrases, Hausa deserves to rank among the foremost languages of the\r\nDark Continent; and Sir Harry Johnston includes it with English, French,\r\nItalian, Portuguese, Arabic and Swahili among the great languages of New\r\nAfrica.[44]\r\n\r\nThe first vocabulary of Hausa was compiled by Mr. James Richardson, who,\r\nin company with Dr. Barth and Dr. Overweg, crossed the desert to Lake\r\nChad in 1850-51.[45] Upon his return from Africa, Dr. Barth himself\r\npublished a work upon the Hausa, Fulfulde and Kanuri[46] languages.\r\nMessrs. Schön[47] and Krause subsequently devoted much study to the\r\nsubject, and the former issued a remarkable book on the Hausa language\r\nin 1876, of which there appeared a revised edition in 1885. Later on,\r\nMr. John A. Robinson, M.A., a scholar of Christ College, Cambridge, made\r\nfurther researches into Hausa during his stay at Lokoja. After his death\r\nthe Hausa Association was formed (1891) with the object of continuing\r\nhis labours, and in 1894 the Reverend Charles Henry Robinson, M.A.—now\r\nCanon Robinson of Ripon—was despatched by the Association to Kano.\r\nCanon Robinson and his companions Dr. Tonkin and Mr. Bonner spent three\r\nmonths in Kano, and in due course the former published an account of his\r\nexperiences[48] which excited much attention, coming as it did so soon\r\nafter Lieutenant-Colonel Monteil’s remarkable journey from St. Louis\r\nto Tripoli through Kano had revived the world’s interest in the famous\r\nHausa city. Since then the Hausa Association has published four works\r\non the Hausa[49] language. In 1897 the Cambridge University appointed a\r\nUniversity Lecturer in Hausa, and the authorities of Christ’s College\r\nestablished a Hausa scholarship open to graduates of the University or\r\nothers who have passed an examination in at least one Semitic language.\r\nThe initiative thus displayed by the Hausa Association[50] and by Canon\r\nRobinson is worthy of all praise, and it is greatly to be hoped that\r\nfurther efforts may be forthcoming which will extend so useful a field of\r\ninquiry to the other great languages of Northern Nigeria, Fulfulde and\r\nKanuri.\r\n\r\nThe Hausa language appears to belong to the Hamitic group, although\r\nit contains numerous Semitic idioms, and also a large number of words\r\nborrowed from the Arabic.\r\n\r\nSome controversy exists as to whether Hausa can be properly considered a\r\nwritten language or not. Canon Robinson stoutly maintains that it is, and\r\neven goes so far as to assert that there is no race north of the Equator,\r\nnor indeed in all Africa outside Egypt and Abyssinia, which has reduced\r\nits language to writing, or made any attempt at the production of a\r\nliterature.[51] That is, as Americans say, a tall order, and I beg leave\r\nto doubt the accuracy of the statement. Sufficient interest attaches to\r\nthe point to merit a cursory examination.\r\n\r\nIn the introductory remarks to his “Magana Hausa” already referred to,\r\nMr. Schön speaks of himself as the writer of a “previously unwritten\r\nlanguage”—meaning, of course, Hausa. Commenting upon that passage in\r\nthe preface to the “Hausa-English Dictionary,” Canon Robinson infers\r\nthat, when Schön wrote the words quoted above, he was probably unaware\r\nthat the Hausa possessed any kind of literature at all. That seems to\r\nme a gratuitous assumption, for Barth, who came before Schön, and whose\r\nworks Schön would naturally have consulted, more than once declares\r\ncategorically that the Hausa language is _not_ a written language.\r\nYet Barth knew perfectly well that the Hausa had possessed historical\r\nmanuscripts, since he lamented their destruction by the Fulani at the\r\ncapture of Katsena, which was then, as Kano is to-day, the seat of\r\nculture of the Hausa race. It may therefore be asserted with every\r\nprobability of exactness that Schön spoke _en pleine connaissance\r\nde cause_ when he referred to himself as the writer of a previously\r\nunwritten language. Now, can the existence of a certain number of\r\nmanuscripts in the Hausa language, and written in Arabic characters, be\r\nconsidered sufficient proof that Hausa itself is a written language?\r\nIf so, then Fulfulde is a written language, because Bello committed\r\nto writing in the language of his race, and in Arabic characters,\r\na history of the Sudan; and Kanuri is a written language, because\r\nKoelle[52] published in 1854 a Kanuri grammar founded upon a collection\r\nof manuscript literature in the tongue of the Kanuri and in Arabic\r\ncharacters. In that case it follows that, contrary to what Canon Robinson\r\naffirms, the Hausas are not the only African people north of the Equator,\r\noutside Egypt and Abyssinia, who have reduced their language to writing\r\nor aimed at producing a literature. If the first claim is tenable, if,\r\nthat is to say, Hausa is a written language, then the second claim put\r\nforward is not tenable. I do not propose to continue this appreciation\r\ninto more technical channels, which would probably be wearisome to the\r\nreader, and will content myself with quoting from a letter received by\r\nme some little time ago from a British Officer then in charge of the\r\nMilitary Intelligence Department of Northern Nigeria, whose knowledge\r\nof Hausa has been officially declared to be “unique.” Being unable to\r\nreconcile Canon Robinson’s statements that it was a written language,\r\nwith the facts as they presented themselves to me, I finally turned to my\r\ncorrespondent, whose competency I was well aware no one would venture to\r\ndispute. This is what he says:\r\n\r\n    “Robinson’s Hausa Grammar was universally pronounced a failure\r\n    by all officers of the West African Frontier Force, and they\r\n    could make no progress by using it. I have already told you\r\n    that the natives say they could not understand him. Moreover,\r\n    one hardly talks the same class of Hausa to any two Hausas\r\n    consecutively; but after a couple of minutes’ conversation\r\n    with a native one knows his dialect, and what words to use,\r\n    and how to pronounce those words, the pronunciation varying\r\n    considerably.[53] The Hausa writing, very little of which\r\n    exists, is simply Hausa written phonetically in Arabic\r\n    characters, there being no recognised way of spelling one\r\n    word, which fact alone proves how little the written language\r\n    is used. Nowadays Hausa is scarcely ever written, except\r\n    isolated words, such as ‘Sariki’ and ‘bature.’ The Hausa\r\n    writing is called ‘Ajumi,’ and when such words are used in\r\n    an Arabic letter, it is usual to prefix the word ‘Ajumi,’ in\r\n    order to warn the reader that the following words are Hausa,\r\n    not Arabic. The Arabic used is primitive, but correct. As the\r\n    Hausa vowel sounds cannot always be correctly represented by\r\n    the Arabic vowel marks, there is only the context to guide\r\n    one in many Hausa written words, and the task of spelling out\r\n    every word phonetically is a laborious one, especially when\r\n    the proper sound cannot in all cases be represented. I have\r\n    seen some of the most learned Mallams in Nigeria experience\r\n    great difficulty in reading Canon Robinson’s specimens of Hausa\r\n    literature. Canon Robinson attaches much too much importance to\r\n    the Hausa writing. The few specimens that exist are interesting\r\n    as curiosities, but the language is useless as a means of\r\n    communication.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL INDUSTRY OF SOUTHERN NIGERIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe palm-oil tree is the staple product of the whole of the coastwise\r\nregions of West Africa from Sierra Leone[54] right down to the Lower\r\nCongo. The Niger Delta may be considered as the central region of its\r\nproduction. Since regular administration was set up in the rivers,[55]\r\nthe output of the oil and kernels of the palm-oil tree has been as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                         OIL.\r\n\r\n    Year.

O. report  491,131\r\n\r\nThe great majority of the oil is sent to England, but France takes a\r\nconsiderable quantity (£70,880 out of the total of £491,131 in 1900), and\r\nGermany also purchases a fair amount (£28,094 in 1900).\r\n\r\n                       KERNELS.\r\n\r\n    Year.

O. report   430,016\r\n\r\nThe output of kernels seems to be steadily on the increase. Germany is\r\nfar and away the largest purchaser of Nigeria’s kernels. In 1900 she\r\ntook more than two-thirds—to the value of £346,997—of the total for that\r\nyear.[58] Thus in eight years the fruit of the palm-oil tree in Nigeria\r\nis seen by these figures to have yielded no less than £6,453,900. The\r\nproduction has certainly been greater, as the Niger Company’s exports of\r\noil and kernels are only included for 1900, the quantities and values for\r\nthe preceding years not being publicly accessible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAKING PALM-OIL]\r\n\r\nThe chief centres of palm-oil production in the Niger proper as distinct\r\nfrom the Delta, or, in other words, in the territories formerly under the\r\nadministrative sway of, and still almost entirely tapped in a commercial\r\nsense by, the Niger Company are Ogute Lake, Atani, and Onitsha. The Ogute\r\nLake produces about 4500 casks of oil annually; it is connected by the\r\nOrashe River, for small craft drawing four feet in the dry season and\r\neight feet in the rainy season, with Degama, but is only open from the\r\nNiger River during the rainy season (for craft drawing seven feet) or say\r\nfrom August to the end of December. It is about seventy hours distant\r\nfrom Burutu. Atani yields about 6000 casks per annum. It is open from the\r\nsea _viâ_ Burutu or Akassa all the year round. Distance from Burutu about\r\ntwo and a half days. Onitsha will probably exceed before long the other\r\ntwo districts mentioned as a productive centre, the population being very\r\ndense; distance from Burutu, three days. For kernels, Assay is the chief\r\ncentre, producing about 6000 tons annually. It is open all the year round\r\nfrom Burutu for craft drawing about five to five and a half feet, and\r\nbetween July and October the rains permit of navigation for craft drawing\r\nup to twelve feet; passage from Burutu, twenty-four hours. Illushi, Idah,\r\nLokoja, Egga, Jebba, and Shongo are other important centres.\r\n\r\nThe commerce derived from the oil-palm tree, apart from its paramount\r\nimportance in a commercial sense, has many and varied features of\r\ninterest. It was, for example, so far as the oil is concerned, the\r\ntrade which first took the place of the slave traffic. The beverage\r\nextracted from it is mentioned in some of the oldest references to the\r\nDark Continent—thus we know that Cambyses “delighted” in its flavour,\r\nand Herodotus tells us that amongst the gifts with which he despatched\r\nthe mission of the Ichthyophagi to Ethiopia was “a cask of palm-wine.”\r\nCollecting the palm-tree’s fruit may also be said to be the national\r\nindustry of the West African Negro almost all along the coast—certainly\r\nin Southern Nigeria.[59] It is an industry which permanently employs\r\nhundreds of thousands of Negroes, men, women, and children, and gives\r\nwork to many thousands of white men, from the merchant to the steamship\r\nowner, from the manufacturer to the chemist. Often in watching the long\r\nfiles of carts conveying the bulky barrels in which palm-oil is shipped\r\nhome from the west coast, passing along the Liverpool streets, or the\r\nrows upon rows of these casks and heaps of palm-kernel bags piled up\r\non the dock’s side, have I marvelled at the ignorance of those persons\r\nwho inform us that the native of West Africa will not _work_. Not work,\r\nwith this testimony to his labours! Not work, when hundreds of English\r\nworkmen are busy unloading, rolling and carting these proofs of the\r\nNegro’s industry every month in the year, every week in the month, every\r\nday in the week almost! Not work, when it is borne in mind that this\r\nbrilliant yellow stuff with the penetrating smell, shipped in hundreds of\r\nthousands of gallons from West Africa, is brought down to the coast bit\r\nby bit, in small receptacles, often from considerable distances inland,\r\non the heads of these idle and lazy people; that the kernels in those\r\ngreasy, dirty-looking bags have each been extracted with infinite trouble\r\nfrom an extremely hard shell, that 400 of them are required to make a\r\nsingle pound of kernels, and that the market value in Southern Nigeria\r\nof those 400 kernels, to the native, is the maximum sum of one penny! A\r\nstone-breaker’s job in this country is not looked upon as a sinecure, but\r\nI beg leave to doubt whether the stone-breaker would be content with one\r\npenny per every 400 stones he breaks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DUKE-TOWN, OLD CALABAR, SOUTHERN NIGERIA]\r\n\r\nThere is not another tree in the whole world which produces money with so\r\nlittle expense as this particular crop. In Nigeria the oil is prepared\r\nusually in small quantities, in the small villages scattered over the\r\ncountry. After being prepared, it is in many instances carried by women\r\nand children to some central native market, situate as a rule on the\r\nedge of a waterway. There it is bought by the middlemen so called, who\r\nare really the carriers of the country, and put by them into the casks\r\npreviously supplied by the European merchants. The casks are packed\r\naway in canoes, and the middlemen paddle down through the creeks for\r\ndistances varying with the length and character of the waterways, to the\r\nmerchant’s factory at the mouth. The merchant then pays for the oil,\r\ngives the middleman an empty cask in exchange for the full one, and\r\nships the latter by the first steamer that comes along, the middlemen\r\ncoopering it up and making it as sound as possible before starting off\r\non their homeward journey. Palm-oil is used in the manufacture of soap\r\nand candles.[60] It is also employed in South Wales and the States in\r\nthe preparation of tin plates, the plates when white hot being dipped in\r\npalm-oil, which gives them their smooth and glassy surface. The demand\r\nfor palm oil increases annually, and for many years to come is likely to\r\nkeep up with the supply.\r\n\r\nThe transaction which takes place between the merchant and the middleman\r\nnative is the simplest feature of the trade. Before that stage has\r\nbeen reached there are ramifications innumerable. A middleman chief,\r\nfor instance, will send ten or twelve canoes up the creeks with goods\r\nwhich he has purchased on trust[61]—a large proportion of the trade is\r\nstill carried out on the trust system, credit being given as between the\r\nmerchant and the middleman, the middleman and the producer, and again\r\nthe producer with other producers further afield, the nearest producer\r\nbecoming thus a middleman or carrier for his more distant countrymen—each\r\nof the canoes being in charge of one of his “boys,” with enough men to\r\nconvey the craft to a certain market. There that particular canoe remains\r\nuntil the goods it has got on board are sold and the canoe is full of\r\noil. The same thing occurs in the case of every market in the district,\r\nand so on all over the country, the canoes sometimes remaining several\r\nweeks away.\r\n\r\nApart from the porterage, purchase, putting into casks, conveying by\r\nwater, final sale and shipment, which employs such numbers of natives in\r\ntheir respective _rôles_, there is the collection and preparation to be\r\ntaken into account before a complete idea can be formed of the varied\r\nstages the palm-oil industry goes through until the product is landed\r\non our shores. There is, first of all, the process of climbing the tree\r\nto get the fruit, which, of course, is at the top. After removing the\r\nfruit the natives are able, when the nut is properly ripe, to shake it\r\nout of the spiky casing in which it grows. The nut is something like a\r\nplum-stone, only bigger, and contains the oil to the thickness of about\r\none-eighth of an inch. Inside is the kernel, itself enclosed in a very\r\nhard shell. To extract the oil the outer skin or shell has to be split\r\nor peeled off. The nuts are usually flung into an old canoe, the natives\r\ntrampling upon and crushing the outer skin, and then put into boiling\r\nwater, which brings the oil to the surface. But there are a good many\r\nways of preparing the oil, and its different characteristics were at one\r\ntime supposed to be due to different ways of preparation on various parts\r\nof the coast. That does not appear to be the opinion now, for the theory\r\nis hardly sufficient to account for the extra quantity of glycerine such\r\nas is met with in Bonny and Old Calabar oil, and the larger proportion of\r\nstearine[62] which exists in the hard kinds of Brass and New Calabar. We\r\nhave now come to an end of the history of the collection of palm-oil, and\r\nthe second use to which the oil-palm lends itself arrives upon the scene.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FILLING PALM-OIL BARRELS, SOUTHERN NIGERIA]\r\n\r\nWith the breakage of the nut and the extraction of the oil, there\r\nis left the kernel in its covering. The kernel trade did not become\r\ngeneral[63] until a few years ago, the kernel being usually either left\r\nto decay or to reproduce, and for a considerable time it was pointed\r\nout that hundreds of thousands of pounds were annually lost in this\r\nway. But within a comparatively recent time the natives have been\r\ninduced to break the hard shell in which the kernel is enclosed, and the\r\nlatter are shipped home in yearly increasing quantities from Nigeria\r\nby the merchants, who dispose of them to the African Oil Mills[64] or\r\nsome other seed-crushing establishment in Liverpool, or send them to\r\nHamburg: Germany, as already stated, being the largest buyer. The kernel\r\nyields an oil which in its concrete form is white in contrast with the\r\nyellowy-red or deep red or ochre colouring of the oil in the nut itself,\r\nand is the principal ingredient in Sunlight and other soaps of a similar\r\ncharacter. In its chemical properties it is almost identical with the oil\r\npressed from the inside of the cocoa-nut—_i.e._ copra—which is known as\r\n“cocoa-nut oil.” It is exclusively used in the manufacture of soap.\r\n\r\nOwing to the very great labour entailed in cracking the shells, a task\r\ngenerally performed by putting the nut on a stone and breaking it with a\r\nstone or stick, and the immense amount of time wasted by so primitive a\r\nmethod, it cannot but be a matter for astonishment that some mechanical\r\ncontrivance has not been devised and put to general usage whereby the\r\nprocess might be accelerated and facilitated. It is certainly not due to\r\nany fear of exhausting the supply by too rapid production, for, so far\r\nas any conclusions can be based upon the quantity of oil brought down to\r\nthe factories, Nigeria is still a long way off producing anything like\r\nthe full quantity of kernels available. The fact is that several attempts\r\nhave been made in this direction, but with one exception[65] they have\r\nfailed, and the failure has discouraged further efforts. Cracking\r\nmachines of various kinds have been imported, but through neglect, the\r\ndeadly effect of the West African climate upon machinery of any kind—more\r\nespecially perhaps in so very humid a part as the Niger Delta—and other\r\ncauses, they have speedily become “old iron.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PALM-KERNEL MARKET IN SOUTHERN NIGERIA]\r\n\r\nAlthough it may seem presumptuous for an outsider to make such a\r\nsuggestion, I cannot but think that something more might be done, in\r\na systematic and concentrated way, to bring about so great a reform\r\nas the cracking of the kernel-shells by machinery could not fail to\r\nbe; quadrupling as it would the total production, and releasing a\r\nlarge amount of labour, which could be turned into other channels. In\r\nview of the very meagre remuneration which the native is willing to\r\naccept per pound’s weight of kernels cracked by hand, it is difficult\r\nto understand how any real trouble, that decent wages and tactful\r\nmanagement were capable of overcoming, could be apprehended in the\r\nutilisation of sufficient labour to keep the requisite steam-power at\r\nwork, more especially as, it is known, the shells would provide a fairly\r\nefficient fuel ready to hand. Moreover, would machinery elaborate enough\r\nto necessitate steam-power be absolutely essential? Could nothing be\r\ninvented in the way of importing automatic hand-cracking machines, the\r\ncracking taking place under white supervision at the factories, and the\r\nmiddlemen carriers bringing in the undecorticated nut, instead of, as at\r\npresent, the kernel itself?[66]\r\n\r\nThere seems to be much need in this great oil-palm industry, as in other\r\nnative industries in West Africa, of co-operation among the official\r\nand commercial classes, which make up the white population—missionaries\r\nexcepted—for the adoption of some thorough and comprehensive plan of\r\nteaching the natives more scientific methods of production. It is no use\r\nsaying the thing cannot be done. It can be done, and has been done. The\r\nmost notable example is provided in the history of ground-nut cultivation\r\nin Senegal, which has by no means reached perfection,[67] or anything\r\nlike it, and yet is now realising a million sterling per annum. That\r\nstriking result was attained by patient, continuous and unflagging\r\nperseverance on the part of the Bordeaux merchants, coupled with the\r\nfriendly support and assistance of the Government, without coercion of\r\nany kind. It took some time, of course, but the results have thoroughly\r\njustified the policy pursued, and Senegal to-day[68] is the foremost\r\nvegetable-oil producing country in the world. We hear a great deal about\r\ntechnical education in West Africa, carpentering, brick-making, and so\r\nforth, all very admirable in their way, but the time and money spent\r\nin these directions could be more profitably engaged by perfecting the\r\n_existing native industries_ of West Africa, and by creating new ones,\r\nwhich would do more than anything else to increase the prosperity of\r\nthe country, and at the same time be based upon sound science, for\r\nthe natural instincts and aptitude of the Negro are pre-eminently\r\nagricultural. Far more lasting good could be achieved thus.\r\n\r\nOfficials and merchants working side by side for a common aim, and\r\nscience—that is what West Africa needs. What a reflection it is upon our\r\nAdministration in West Africa, that the commercial position of Sierra\r\nLeone, for instance, should be declining, year by year, largely owing to\r\na passion for keeping up a form of taxation which is repugnant to the\r\nnatives, and does not even pay the cost of collection, when thousands of\r\npounds annually are wasted in the Sherbro district alone by the natives\r\nmerely collecting the kernels, leaving the oil to rot off—all for want\r\nof encouragement, and the teaching of scientific methods of production,\r\nwhile acres upon acres of rubber-producing land in Lagos have been\r\nimpaired by a similar absence of preliminary common sense. Perhaps the\r\nmost curious feature of the whole business is that which consists in\r\nturning round and blaming the native for wilful destruction which—in the\r\nlatter case mentioned—he was never taught how to avoid. If the oil-palm\r\nindustry were taken in hand in practical fashion, there is no possible\r\ndoubt that an enormous development would ensue. But while the want of\r\nsympathy and combination, one might almost say the latent opposition,\r\nbetween the official and merchant class continues, I cannot see that\r\nmatters will be different to what they are. The remedy lies very largely\r\nwith the Authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE ADMINISTRATION OF NORTHERN NIGERIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Empire has few more experienced servants in the Tropical African\r\nfield than Sir Frederick Lugard. Like every other man who has become\r\nprominent, he possesses critics, and no doubt, like every one else, has\r\nmade mistakes, but, speaking generally, he is very highly thought of.\r\nWhether General Lugard, with his military instincts and training, is the\r\nright man in the right place, is a matter upon which opinion may differ.\r\nAmong military men who have served England in Equatorial Africa, no one\r\nmore distinguished could have been chosen. The only reflection which\r\nhis appointment gave rise to was an impersonal one. Nobody doubted his\r\ncapacity, but it was suggested that the delicate problems of internal\r\npolitics existing in Northern Nigeria required civilian rather than\r\nmilitary habits of mind to cope with.\r\n\r\nThose problems are infinitely complex. Seldom did a situation call for\r\ngreater display of tact, sympathy and wise discernment. Seldom was there\r\na more abundant supply of combustible material ready to take fire upon\r\nthe initiation of a policy which should lack these qualities. Never a\r\nfield more promising of desirable results to reward a just and humane\r\nstewardship, whose highest aim should be the contentment and prosperity\r\nof the people committed to its charge, and whose guiding spirit should\r\nbe patience, and, as Sir Andrew Clarke puts it, “use of the power of\r\nimagination.”\r\n\r\nNorthern Nigeria, it need hardly be observed, differentiates absolutely\r\nfrom the southern province, in the nature of its soil, configuration,\r\naltitude, vegetation: in its ethnologic material, in religion, culture,\r\nsocial condition, political organisation. We have passed out of the pagan\r\nbelt, and are in contact with a more advanced type of civilisation; we\r\nhave left the forest and merged into the plain, into open park-like\r\ncountry, sparsely timbered as a rule when compared with the southern\r\nregions; pasture land, agricultural land covered with fields of waving\r\nmillet and _masara_, peopled by splendid herds of cattle, where horses\r\nand long-nosed sheep are reared. Animism or fetishism no longer\r\npredominates; a revealed religion has replaced it. Semitic infusion is\r\nnow everywhere apparent. It is a new world we have entered—a strange\r\njumbling of two continents, an amalgam of cross-migratory currents\r\nseverally attracted by the fertility of the soil; an industrialism\r\nat once remarkable, deeply interesting and of great promise. A rough\r\nfeudalism, a loose central authority, a barbaric splendour in the midst\r\nof primitive surroundings, a system of rule superior to anything we have\r\nyet encountered, and of which the strongest binding cord is religious\r\nfaith; large cities, extensive cultivations, tanneries, dye-pits,\r\nlooms. A number of States, owning allegiance—more religious and racial\r\nthan political—to a supreme chief, and appointing their own district\r\ngovernors, treasurers, war ministers, judges; controlling their own\r\narmies, managing their own exchequers. Society divided into two distinct\r\nclasses—the aristocrats and the plebs—which correspond to divergencies of\r\nrace, each class confined to its own quarter, rarely mingling in licit\r\nintercourse, perhaps more so than formerly, yet perpetuating a strain of\r\npure stock which must have existed in Africa for at least two thousand\r\nyears. Away from the towns, in favoured districts, herdsmen of Semitic\r\nblood; planters, agriculturists. In the towns, statesmen, warriors on\r\nthe one side; on the other, manufacturers and traders. Riven through the\r\ncountry, highways of commerce, centuries old, branching to north, east\r\nand west, over which the tramp of feet and hoofs resounded when Rome held\r\nNorth Africa, and built her forts to the desert’s edge—aye, and beyond\r\nwhat man and nature have made the desert’s edge—oxen and mules carrying\r\nnatron, and asses bearing kola, camels with salt, Eastern spices, and\r\nbales of cotton from far-off Benghazi, cotton brought from Manchester,\r\nsilks from France, needles and writing-paper from Germany, beads and\r\nlooking-glasses from Venice; richly caparisoned steeds with their\r\ngaily-clad riders, _meharas_ swift of foot, with the _lithamed_ Tuareg\r\nbestriding them; the Fulani shepherd driving along his flocks. Over there\r\nby the lake, herds of elephants roam untroubled, while the Shuwa, with\r\nhis hair trimmed _à l’Egyptienne_, wanders restlessly, as though seeking\r\nto pierce the mystery of his origin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH MAP OF NORTHERN NIGERIA SHEWING DIVISION INTO\r\nPROVINCES]\r\n\r\nInto that country the white man has come in accordance with the ancient\r\nprophecy, descendants of the white man who first visited it. The same\r\nrace, the dominating race, which ever aspires after empire, and which,\r\non occasion, forgets that the sword untempered by the plough has proved\r\ndisastrous to many Empires.\r\n\r\nAs before stated, two years elapsed between the advent of the Crown\r\nColony system in Northern Nigeria and the publication of the first report\r\nby Sir Frederick Lugard. With no official data available whereby the\r\nCommissioner’s policy or the Government’s intentions could be gauged, the\r\npublic were only able to judge of the trend of both one and the other\r\nthrough the scanty information communicated by the news agencies, or\r\nby the vehicle of private letters from Europeans resident in Northern\r\nNigeria. It cannot be said that such news as did filter through the\r\nthick veil in which Northern Nigeria lay wrapped prior to the belated\r\npublication of Sir Frederick Lugard’s report in February 1902 was of a\r\nreassuring nature. On the contrary, while necessary police-work in Bornu\r\nwas so entirely neglected that the French found themselves compelled by\r\na combination of local circumstances to practically run that country\r\nfor us, to give sanctuary to its lawful ruler, to beat off and finally\r\ntrack to his lair the man who, following his father’s evil way, was\r\ncreating a desert wherever he passed; events in Sokoto, which had been\r\nin constant treaty relations with Great Britain’s representatives since\r\n1884, seemed to justify the worst fears, and to corroborate the late\r\nMary Kingsley’s prediction that “three months of Crown Colony form of\r\ngovernment in the Niger Territories will bring war, far greater and\r\nmore destructive than any war we have yet had in West Africa, and will\r\nend in the formation of a debt far greater than any debt we now have in\r\nWest Africa, because of the greater extent of territory and the greater\r\npower of the native States, now living peacefully enough under England,\r\nbut not England as misrepresented by the Crown Colony system.” The news\r\nreceived was exclusively of a military nature. It recorded the exploits\r\nof numerous expeditions against native rulers, the “smashing” of this\r\nChief and the other, foreshadowed a large increase in the Frontier Force,\r\nand a further extension of the area of punitive undertakings. Every\r\nsteamer for Burutu had its complement of officers on board for Nigeria,\r\nand the military element appeared to reign supreme. At the same time the\r\npropagandist efforts of Bishop Tugwell at Kano, which should never have\r\nbeen allowed, resulted in what was predicted of them when started, viz.\r\nfailure, utter and complete. Disappointment had its inevitable sequel\r\nin the shape of a strengthening of the repressive theory for Nigeria by\r\nthe apostles of peace. Bishop Tugwell’s chief assistant, the Rev. J.\r\nA. E. Richardson, on his return hastened to get himself interviewed by\r\nReuter, described “the Emir of Sokoto and the King of Kano as the chief\r\nopponents of civilisation in this part of the world,” and expressed\r\nhis hope that the former would be speedily “dealt with.” In the same\r\ninterview, this youthful and enthusiastic reformer was fain to admit the\r\nexistence in the territories of the aforesaid “opponents of civilisation”\r\nof “fields upon fields of cultivated land,” houses “splendidly made,”\r\n“broad thoroughfares,” “big, beautiful gardens,” &c. The existing\r\n“civilisation,” although not of the Exeter Hall pattern, had at least\r\nsomething to recommend it! The theme was taken up at home by another\r\nbishop, who delivered a sermon which was simply an appeal to brute force\r\nin Northern Nigeria, and provoked a good deal of comment. Observers\r\nnoted an almost exact parallel between Northern Nigeria and East Africa,\r\nwhere the havoc wrought by the unchecked forces of militarism and\r\nreligious bigotry is of public notoriety.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Frederick Lugard’s report appeared its pages were eagerly\r\nscanned, and it was with intense relief that a clear, definite line of\r\naction was traced therein, and that an apparently determined intention\r\nwas noted to make a stand against certain undesirable features of policy\r\nwhich had already become conspicuous. In fact, so outspoken were some of\r\nSir Frederick Lugard’s remarks that it was permissible and legitimate\r\nto suppose that many of the things which had occurred did not meet with\r\nhis approval. Another reflection suggested itself from a perusal of the\r\nreport, viz. that the Commissioner was being hampered in the pursuance of\r\nhis task by the absence of the right type of political assistants. Events\r\nsubsequent to the report have tended to confirm rather than weaken that\r\nimpression, which, however, is, after all, but an impression, and cannot\r\nat present be asserted as a fact.[69]\r\n\r\nThe chief points to be gathered from the report, as bearing upon\r\nthe Commissioner’s policy, were (1) maintenance of Fulani rule, (2)\r\nnecessity of taking in hand the affairs of Bornu, (3) advisability of\r\naccepting with great caution mere accusations of slave-raiding, (4) harm\r\nperpetrated by crude information, (5) recognition that more good can be\r\neffected “by getting into touch with the people” than by “a series of\r\npunitive expeditions and bloodshed,” (6) no compulsory religious training.\r\n\r\nA programme such as this cannot fail to command universal approval, and\r\nif Sir Frederick Lugard is determined to unflinchingly carry it out he\r\ncan count upon the thorough-going support of every single person in this\r\ncountry who takes a lively interest in British West Africa. Nay more, he\r\ncan rely with confidence upon receiving the most strenuous backing should\r\nit at any time become apparent that, in his attempt to get his own way,\r\nhe is not being sufficiently seconded by the Home Authorities, or that\r\nthe policy of Downing Street in specific directions makes the attainment\r\nof that programme difficult if not impossible. Having said so much, it\r\nis to be hoped that any criticism directed to the affairs of Northern\r\nNigeria may not be misunderstood in the quarter where one would greatly\r\ndesire it to be looked upon in the light of a friendly attempt to assist,\r\nand not as criticism is so often regarded on West African matters, as\r\nbeing due to a carping desire to find fault on the part of those who,\r\nwhile fully entitled to speak their minds, are distant from the scene of\r\naction, and have none of the worry and trouble involved in actual contact\r\nwith, or direct responsibility for, the questions upon which they write.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE FINANCES OF NIGERIA\r\n\r\n\r\nOn June 30, 1899, a Treasury Minute informed the Royal Niger Company of\r\nthe intention of her Majesty’s Government to revoke their charter. At the\r\nend of 1899 Sir Frederick Lugard proceeded to Africa to take over the\r\nNiger Company’s territories in the name of Great Britain. On January 1,\r\n1900, Crown Colony Administration was established in the Niger Company’s\r\nterritories, following its similar establishment in the Delta, which had\r\ntaken place some years previously.[70] In February 1902 the Government\r\ncondescended for the first time—in the face of public pressure—to\r\npublish a report by Sir Frederick Lugard, _dated London, May 1, 1901_.\r\nThe report, which is very interesting, but in many respects incomplete,\r\nnotably as regards finance, only brings us down to March 31, 1901, so\r\nthat, although we are now well on in the third year of Crown Colony\r\nAdministration in Northern Nigeria, this single report is the measure of\r\nthe confidence which the Government sees fit to repose in the British\r\npeople, concerning the direct responsibilities they have acquired over\r\nsome twenty-five million natives of Africa.\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons why the public should not rest content with\r\nsuch meagre information. The first reason is financial. The expenditure\r\nof the two Protectorates—Northern and Southern Nigeria—is assuming very\r\nlarge proportions, a heavy load of debt weighs over them, and not only\r\nis there not the slightest sign of an effort to wipe off that debt, but\r\nalmost every month that passes sees an extension of liabilities. The\r\npresent condition of our national finances does not justify a continued\r\nattitude of indifference towards the expenditure of public funds on an\r\nincreasing scale in Nigeria. On the other hand, our main object in West\r\nAfrica being what it is, viz. commercial in nature, there is extreme\r\nunwisdom, from the ordinary business point of view, in neglecting to\r\nascertain how the largest and most important of our estates in West\r\nAfrica is being managed, and if the outlay is giving now, or is likely\r\nto give in an appreciably near future, those returns which the public is\r\njustified in expecting.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are the facts as to the financial situation of Northern and\r\nSouthern Nigeria? In the first place, there is the debt of £865,000\r\nincurred by the Government in buying out the Niger Company. This debt is,\r\nwhile it exists, a bar to progress, and at a Conference held in London\r\non September 20, 1900, we find Sir Ralph Moor, Commissioner for Southern\r\nNigeria, admitting the fact. When a speaker at that Conference urged that\r\nmore should be spent on technical education in the Protectorate, and\r\nthat the necessary amount might be paid out of the surplus revenue, Sir\r\nRalph Moor quickly retorted that they had no surplus revenue, but were\r\n“in the unenviable position of owing her Majesty’s Treasury £800,000.” So\r\nmuch for the debt, and the obstacle to desirable improvements which its\r\nexistence entails.[71]\r\n\r\nThe debt notwithstanding, the administrative expenditure of Southern\r\nNigeria steadily increases. In the year 1899-1900[72] it reached the\r\nfigure of £176,128,[73] being an increase of £29,383 over the preceding\r\nyear, and exceeded the revenue by £12,000. No figures are yet available\r\nof the expenditure of Northern Nigeria since the substitution of the\r\nCrown for the Niger Company in the _rôle_ of Administrator, but a\r\nreference to the estimates of March 31, 1902, shows that Northern Nigeria\r\nreceived a grant-in-aid of £88,800 in 1900-01, and another of £280,000 in\r\n1901-02, which includes the provision of £200,000 for the West African\r\nFrontier Force voted in 1900-01. We are, therefore, confronted with\r\na minimum expenditure for Northern Nigeria in two years of £368,800.\r\nAt this rate it is difficult to see how Nigeria is ever to become\r\nself-supporting. Such an enormous expenditure could only be warranted by\r\nan extraordinary development in trade, or by the creation of means of\r\ncommunication for that development, to be looked upon in the light of\r\nexpenditure on capital account. It is all very well to call it “Imperial\r\nexpenditure.” Of course it is “Imperial” expenditure, and so is every\r\npenny spent in the furtherance of British trade abroad “Imperial.” What\r\nwe have to try and form an opinion upon is whether the administrative\r\nexpenses of Nigeria are in any way proportionate to the interests which\r\nthe Administration is supposed to be promoting there. If it is, well and\r\ngood; if it is not, reform is required.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the expenditure to the trade of Nigeria is comparatively\r\neasy to establish. The total trade (excluding specie) of the Niger Coast\r\nProtectorate in 1898-99 amounted to £1,477,398, and the total trade of\r\nNigeria—that is, the Niger Coast Protectorate plus the territories of the\r\nNiger Company—in 1900 (excluding specie) was £2,113,878. If we deduct,\r\ntherefore, the one set of figures from the other we can arrive at a close\r\napproximation of the trade done in the former Niger Company’s territories\r\nincluded since 1900 in the Protectorate of Nigeria. The trade of the\r\nNiger Company’s territories in 1901 was, therefore, roughly £650,000, of\r\nwhich it is quite safe to assume that Northern Nigeria did not produce\r\nmore than one-third, if it produced that, the bulk of the trade being\r\nconfined to the Niger Company’s territories in the Lower River. The\r\ntrade of Northern Nigeria would thus be represented by some £216,660\r\nout of the total of £650,000. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that\r\nit rose in 1901 to £250,000, the total for the two years 1900 and 1901\r\nwould be £466,660. Now Northern Nigeria, as already stated, received\r\nfor the same period £368,800 from the Imperial Exchequer. Pursuing the\r\nsame method of illustration for the export trade as for total trade,\r\nthe export trade of the Niger Company’s territories works out at some\r\n£360,000, of which, say, one-third from Northern Nigeria, or £120,000.\r\nPutting it down at £140,000 in 1901 gives a total of Northern Nigeria’s\r\nexport trade, or, in other words, Northern Nigeria’s producing capacity\r\nfor the two years mentioned of £260,000, so that Northern Nigeria is in\r\nthe disastrous financial situation of spending more than it produces. The\r\none-third basis of calculation is a large and generous one, and Northern\r\nNigeria’s share of responsibility in the debt is not included in the\r\nreckoning. The position then, so far as Northern Nigeria is concerned,\r\nis unmistakably clear. Northern Nigeria is at present a financial burden\r\nto the Empire. Eight years’ experience of Crown Colony Administration in\r\nthe Niger Delta, where the machinery set up is not nearly so elaborate\r\nas in Northern Nigeria and where the natural exploitable riches are far\r\ngreater, is hardly calculated to cause feelings of confidence as to what\r\neight years of a similar system will lead to in Northern Nigeria. In the\r\nthree years ending December 1899 the Niger Delta (excluding therefrom the\r\nNiger Company’s territories) produced a trade which averaged in value\r\n£1,800,000, of which over £1,000,000[74] represented exports. Under\r\nthe Crown Colony system, with its expensive machinery necessitating\r\ntaxation to keep up, its military expenditure, and the absence of all\r\ncommercial co-operation in the Administration, the value of exports has\r\nonly once (1893-94) managed to rise above £1,000,000, while with that one\r\nexception the highest and lowest figures have been £844,333 and £750,223\r\nrespectively, and the total volume of trade for any given three years\r\nhas never reached the average figure of £1,800,000. The totals of the\r\nthree years prior to 1900 were respectively £1,441,383, £1,389,922, and\r\n£1,507,288. Making every allowance for the fall in the market price of\r\ncertain products during recent years, which, by the way, has been to\r\nsome extent counterbalanced by the increased export of new articles, the\r\nconclusion to be derived from these figures is that the Crown Colony\r\nsystem in Southern Nigeria has not yielded results which the country has\r\nthe right to expect, and the moral is that, whatever may be the position\r\nof affairs in other British possessions in West Africa, Englishmen should\r\nreally pull themselves together and seriously consider whether the\r\nbrilliant future which Nigeria should have in store for it is to run the\r\nrisk of being compromised just for want of a little courage in facing the\r\nfacts as they are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nMOHAMMEDANS, SLAVE-RAIDING, AND DOMESTIC SERVITUDE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been truly remarked that more permanent good can be accomplished\r\n“by tact and gold with Mohammedan chiefs in West Africa than by the\r\nMaxim and the rifle.” That is a policy which has had much to do with our\r\ngreat and striking success in India. Its application to Afghanistan has\r\nwithin recent years been amply justified by results. Why should it not be\r\nfollowed in Northern Nigeria? Which is cheaper, an output of £5000 per\r\nannum in subsidies, or the expenditure of much larger sums in military\r\noperations? What is more likely to conduce to the prosperity of a vast\r\ndensely populated tropical estate where the white man cannot settle, to\r\ngain your own ends peaceably, albeit not so speedily as might be desired,\r\nor to use force and face the dislocation of the existing social system\r\nwhich violent measures entail? Few people, if they will but calmly\r\nconsider the matter, can fail to endorse the quotation given above. In\r\nNorthern Nigeria the question is not merely one of expediency; it affects\r\nthe honour of England.\r\n\r\nWhen MacGregor Laird started on his pioneering expedition up the Niger\r\nwhich laid the foundations of British trade in the Upper River, his\r\ninstructions from the Government ran as follows: “It is most desirable to\r\nimpress upon the chiefs that you are there as traders, not as colonists,\r\nnot as acquirers of land, but simply as traders and for the protection of\r\ntrade.” When Lord John Russell despatched Captain Trotter and Commander\r\nWilliam Allen up the Niger in 1840, he recognised the advisability of\r\nsubsidising the native chiefs: “he himself (the chief) shall have for\r\nhis own share, and without any payment on his part, a sum not exceeding\r\none-twentieth part value of every article of British merchandise brought\r\nby British ships and sold in his dominions.” When Mr. Joseph Thomson\r\nconcluded in 1884, on behalf of the National African Company, a treaty of\r\namity and friendship with Umoru, Emir of Sokoto, “King of the Mussulmans\r\nof the Sudan,” he undertook on behalf of the Company to pay the Emir 3000\r\nbags of cowries (roughly £1500) per annum. When that treaty was confirmed\r\nwith the Emir on behalf of the Royal Niger Company (the designation of\r\nthe National African Company when it received its charter) in 1890,\r\nand again with the Emir’s successor in 1894, the payment of the annual\r\nsubsidy was confirmed. It was distinctly stipulated in those treaties\r\nthat the Royal Niger Company “received” its power from the Queen of Great\r\nBritain and that “they (the Company) are her Majesty’s representatives\r\nto me.” In the eyes of the Emir, therefore, the Company was just as much\r\n“Great Britain” as a consular representative, or a High Commissioner.\r\nIn exchange for this annual subsidy, the Emir of Sokoto transferred “to\r\nthe above people (the Company) _or other with whom they may arrange_,\r\nmy entire rights to the country on both sides of the River Benue and\r\nrivers flowing into it throughout my dominions for such distance from its\r\nand their banks as they may desire.” The Emir also bound himself not to\r\n“recognise any other white nation, because the Company are my help.” In a\r\nletter dated April 27, 1894, the Prime Minister of Sokoto repudiated any\r\nintention of treating “with any other from the white man’s country except\r\nwith the Royal Niger Company, Limited.” Separate subsidies were also\r\npaid by “her Majesty’s representatives (the Niger Company)” to Gandu,\r\nas well as to the rulers of Nupe, Adamawa, and other important vassals\r\nof the Emir of Sokoto. That, at any rate, was a well-defined political\r\nrelationship. By it the Royal Niger Company were able to secure this vast\r\nand populous country to Great Britain, and by it peace was, with the\r\nexception of Nupe[75] and Ilorin, preserved. Whatever may be said of\r\nthe merits and demerits of the Royal Niger Company as an administrative\r\nbody, it must be readily granted that a coherent policy was here applied,\r\nand that its results were, from the Imperial standpoint, exceedingly\r\nsatisfactory. The nature of the bargain was precise. The Emir of Sokoto\r\nand his vassals conferred extensive rights upon England’s representatives\r\nand agreed to treat with no other country but England on the basis of a\r\nsubsidy of £1500 per annum in the case of Sokoto, and sums varying in\r\nimportance in the case of Sokoto’s vassals. The bargain was—according\r\nto the terms of the treaty—binding upon the Niger Company and its\r\nsuccessors. The Emir of Sokoto kept to his share of it, and at a time\r\nwhen France endeavoured, through Colonel Monteil, to upset the Company’s\r\ntreaty, the Emir loyally observed his obligations.[76] The Company no\r\nless loyally observed theirs. It is humiliating to have to confess it,\r\nbut the British Government has been less loyal than the Company, and less\r\nloyal than the African chief whose loyalty enabled England at a critical\r\nmoment to uphold the claims of her representatives to political influence\r\nover Sokoto. The Crown, it seems, has declined to fulfil the obligations\r\nimposed on England by these treaties, while reaping to the full the\r\nadvantages which the existence of the treaties confers. The first public\r\nintimation that the Imperial Government had broken faith with the Emir of\r\nSokoto was made by the Rev. J. A. E. Richardson, already alluded to. His\r\nstatement ran as follows: “The yearly payment in form of gifts which was\r\nmade to the Emir of Sokoto by the Niger Company has not been continued\r\nby the Imperial Government, and quite recently the Emir flatly refused to\r\nallow the erection of a British telegraph line.” No official announcement\r\nhas been made on the subject, nor has any member of Parliament taken the\r\ntrouble to inquire. But there is not, I think, any doubt whatever that\r\nthe Imperial Government has, in point of fact, done this thing. I have\r\nmade careful inquiries in quarters likely to be well informed, and it\r\nseems that it was considered _infra dig._ for a Government to politically\r\nsubsidise a West African chief. That is an extraordinary doctrine. Since\r\nwhen has it been considered _infra dig._ for Englishmen to keep their\r\nword with native potentates? Since when has it been thought a criterion\r\nof Imperial rule to show native rulers that England’s promise is not\r\nworth the paper upon which it is written? Is that what has been called\r\nthe “new Imperialism”? Is it astonishing that the Emir of Sokoto should,\r\nin the face of such a repudiation of treaty obligations, “flatly refuse”\r\nto allow the erection of a telegraph-line or anything else? Is it not a\r\nterrible handicap upon the professed intentions of the most well-meaning\r\nadministrator, to be confronted at the outset with so powerful a cause of\r\nnative suspicion and hostility?\r\n\r\nLet us observe, for a moment, how the successive stages of British action\r\non the Niger must appear to the native rulers of the country. We start\r\noff by saying that we have come to the country as merchants and nothing\r\nmore, not as acquirers of land, but simply as traders. In 1870 the Emir\r\nof Nupe, Maroba, is found co-operating with Bishop Crowther—an earnest\r\nand godly man—to facilitate the operations of merchants at Lokoja. In\r\n1884 Mr. Joseph Thomson is able, without any show of pomp or power,\r\nto induce the Emir of Sokoto, supreme ruler of the whole country, to\r\nsign a treaty of enormous importance, which practically amounts to a\r\nProtectorate, in exchange for a yearly subsidy. Sixteen years later a\r\nBritish Government ceases the subsidy, and follows up that performance by\r\ninitiating a policy of active interference in the Emir’s dominions. As\r\nthis costs money, the next step will very probably be that the Emir and\r\nhis subjects will be expected to contribute towards the up-keep of the\r\nAdministration, and England, having agreed through her representatives to\r\nsubsidise the Emir in return for advantages conferred, will end by making\r\nthe Emir pay for permission to remain in his own country. “It seems\r\nreally incredible,” remarked the _Morning Post_ the other day, commenting\r\nupon the fighting with the Emir of Kontagora,[77] “that a great Empire\r\nadministering savage countries should have no other weapon save an\r\nappeal to arms.” It has other weapons, and the most potent of them is\r\nthe one upon which the Indian Empire has been reared. That weapon may be\r\ndescribed thus, “Keep to your plighted word.”\r\n\r\nThe cause of the repeated military expeditions of which Northern\r\nNigeria is the scene, is said to be slave-raiding. “Slave-raiding” is\r\nan evil which no one can possibly defend. It leads to great misery, to\r\ndepopulation and devastation. Its agency is violence. To suppress it is\r\nthe duty of every European Government. On those points there can be no\r\ndifference of opinion. The difference comes in when the means adopted\r\nto do away with “slave-raiding” are examined. At present but one remedy\r\nhas been devised and put into practice in Nigeria. It consists in\r\nopposing violence by violence. It has the merit of simplicity, but at\r\nbest it is but a crude way of procedure, and its efficacy as a reforming\r\nagent is open to doubt. “The very foundation,” says Carl Schurz, “of\r\nall civilization consists in the dispensation of justice by peaceable\r\nmethods, instead of the rule of brute force,” and he adds a sentence\r\nwell worth thinking over: “Although a course of warlike adventure may\r\nhave begun with the desire to liberate and civilise certain foreign\r\npopulations, it will be likely to develop itself, unless soon checked,\r\ninto a downright and reckless policy of conquest with all the criminal\r\naggression and savagery such a policy implies.” It is impossible not to\r\nfeel the force and the truth of this sentence when the history of British\r\nEast Africa is studied. These “nigger hunts,” to use the term, not of\r\na “deluded philanthropist” or “impracticable sentimentalist,” two of\r\nthe many choice epithets with which people who do not believe in the\r\npractical advantages of “nigger hunts” are consistently assailed, but of\r\na specially gifted officer, have worked incalculable mischief, and have\r\nput back the hands of the clock for many years. “Some of the wars and the\r\npunitive expeditions of the past few years,” remarks Professor Gregory\r\nin his admirable and impartial work,[78] “have been no doubt inevitable\r\nand just. They have been the ‘Cruel wars of peace.’ But some of the\r\nmilitary expeditions in East Africa have been simply criminal in their\r\nfolly and thoughtlessness.” Yet the Home Authorities defended all these\r\nexpeditions, and covered the perpetrators of blunders with its sheltering\r\nwing, to the detriment not only of the general interests of the Empire,\r\nbut of the efficiency of the public service, by discouraging officials\r\nwho had a different conception of the duties of their position, but who\r\nsaw, by experience, that to get up a row with the natives, to fight some\r\nbrilliant action and get their “heroism” talked about, was the surest way\r\nto obtain promotion. That, I am afraid, is in West Africa also a motive\r\npower to advancement.\r\n\r\nIn his report Sir Frederick Lugard shows that he is alive to the abuses\r\nwhich a too constant “appeal to arms” may give rise to, and how the\r\ndesignation of “slave-raiding” can be converted into a mere excuse to\r\njustify acts of injustice and oppression. “Though force,” he says, “must\r\nbe occasionally applied to bands of recalcitrant robbers, I am convinced\r\nthat a few such lessons will suffice, and that the district officer,\r\nwith tact and patience, aided by sufficient civil police, can achieve\r\nthe pacification of the country effectively, and that parsimony in the\r\nappointment of these officers, and of their native staff of police, &c.,\r\nwould be a policy of false economy, resulting in unnecessary bloodshed.”\r\nAnd again, “It is my conviction that throughout Africa—East and West—much\r\ninjustice and oppression have been unwittingly done by our forces acting\r\non crude information, and accusations of slave-raiding, &c., brought by\r\nenemies of the accused to procure their destruction.”\r\n\r\nWhat is the genesis of this slave-raiding we hear so much about? In the\r\nfirst place, it must be obvious to all who have studied the history\r\nof inland Western Africa with any degree of attention, that a great\r\ndeal of what is called “slave-raiding” is not “slave-raiding” at all,\r\nbut military operations undertaken by the rulers of Mohammedan States\r\nfor the suppression of risings against their authority, rendered\r\nweak by ineffective organisation, and by the absence of adequate\r\nmeans of communication. Sir Frederick Lugard has thrown useful light\r\nupon other circumstances which may lead to wrongful accusations of\r\nslave-raiding.[79] But, taking the first case, how often may not an\r\nexpedition entered upon by a Mohammedan Emir against his pagan subjects\r\nin West Africa be as justifiable, if reckoned by the same standard, as\r\nthe chastisement of a tribe by the representatives of a European Power\r\nfor resisting a tax enforced by that Power, and considered by the tribe\r\nexcessive and unjust? The only fair and rational interpretation of\r\nslave-raiding, properly so-called, is the incursion of an armed band,\r\nwithout previous provocation of any kind, into a peaceful district,\r\nfollowed by the capture of a number of prisoners of war who are\r\nsubsequently sold into slavery by the victors. That is a condition of\r\naffairs by no means peculiar to West Africa. It prevailed in Europe\r\nand in Great Britain at a period when civilisation was infinitely more\r\nadvanced than it is at present in West Africa.\r\n\r\nThe motive forces to which slave-raiding is due in Nigeria are: (1)\r\neconomic necessities, or, in other words, the revenue needs of native\r\nrulers, requiring many prisoners of war who, as has been well said, serve\r\nthe double purpose of cheque-book and beast of burden; (2) the incidental\r\neffect of conquest; (3) the direct incitement given to intertribal wars\r\nby white men on the West Coast of Africa for a period extending over\r\nseveral centuries, a system which, by the way, prevailed not farther back\r\nthan slightly over fifty years ago on the Niger; witness Richardson’s\r\nand Barth’s representations to the Government of the day. Those three\r\ncauses are common to, or have been common to, West Africa as a whole. To\r\nthem must be added, in the case of Northern Nigeria and other countries\r\nin West Africa converted to Islam by the sword, religious zeal. Let us\r\ntake those causes severally one by one and examine them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MOHAMMEDAN CHIEF AND HIS STANDARD-BEARER]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the first, it must be patent to all who can look at the\r\nmatter with unprejudiced eyes that, until native rulers in Northern\r\nNigeria are able to count upon a source of revenue replacing that which\r\nthey lose by the disappearance of raiding operations for slaves, and\r\nuntil a portable currency can be introduced into the country to take\r\nthe place of the human currency—that is, slaves—the economic _raison\r\nd’être_ of raids will remain; and that is why, apart from any other\r\nconsiderations, a subsidy to the native rulers on the part of the\r\nEuropean “over-lord” cannot but prove itself an instrument for good,\r\npending the slower but certain modifications which the creation of\r\nroads, railways, the development of trade which should ensue from their\r\ncreation, and the introduction of an easily portable currency—such as\r\nsilver coinage—cannot fail to bring with them. When in course of time\r\nsuch development takes place, matters should be so arranged that the\r\nrulers of the country benefit by the growth of trade in their respective\r\ndistricts, or, in other words, that a portion of the revenue derived\r\nby the Administration from trade in a given district should accrue to\r\nthe ruler of that district, and be expended in the improvement of that\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nIn all communities where the ethical standard of the people has not\r\nbeen influenced by the Christian ideal, the enslavement of prisoners of\r\nwar has existed from time immemorial. The moral standard of the Fulani\r\nChieftains of to-day is not lower than that of Imperial Rome, and for\r\nmany, many centuries after the tragedy of Golgotha, men enslaved one\r\nanother in England and in Europe as the natural sequel to warfare.\r\n\r\nAs for the heavy load of responsibility which England shares—and to a\r\nvery large extent—with other Powers towards the native of West Africa in\r\nher actual _rôle_ of inculcator of the higher principles of morality, it\r\ncannot too often be called to mind. It is not so very long ago—a mere\r\nnothing in the history of nations—that Englishmen hounded on these native\r\nchiefs against one another, supplied them with arms and ammunition,\r\nexcited their fiercest passions, pandered to their worst vices, and all\r\nfor what? To secure, under circumstances of cruelty more aggravated\r\nbecause more protracted, those very slaves which Englishmen to-day are\r\nbut too ready to liberate, by killing the descendants of the chiefs who\r\nformerly supplied them with the objects of their desire!\r\n\r\nReligious fanaticism has ever been attended with outrages upon humanity,\r\nsometimes directly, sometimes indirectly. In considering the case of\r\nthe Fulani conquerors of Nigeria, we must, if we are just, recollect\r\nhow relative good and evil are in matters of this kind, how dependent\r\nupon those hundred and one things which make up hereditary instincts and\r\nenvironment. Have the Fulani committed more atrocities than Christian\r\nEurope (although far behind Christian Europe of those days) perpetrated\r\nupon the Jews? Can we turn over the pages of Gibbon and condemn to the\r\ndeath penalty these wanderers in Darkest Africa, when we read of the\r\ndeeds of Christians amid “civilised” surroundings, where art and crafts,\r\nthe ease and luxuries of life, culture and refinement had reached,\r\ncomparatively, so high a stage—a stage which West Africa had never known?\r\nAre the episodes of Saint Bartholomew and the persecutions of “bloody”\r\nMary not vividly within our recollection? Do not the lessons of history\r\nsuggest that “civilisation” would best fulfil its mandate, and rise to\r\nthe level of its claims, by drawing upon an abundant store of patience\r\nin dealing with the evil of “slave-raiding” in Nigeria and elsewhere in\r\nWest Africa? And if there be a fair prospect, as there undoubtedly is,\r\nof removing the causes, economical and otherwise, which produce slave\r\nraids, by peaceful methods, to employ the ways of peace rather than the\r\nsword, although the process be a slower one, we can have made but very\r\nfew real strides in the last two thousand years if statesmanship be not\r\nequal to the task. This is sentimentalism, you will say. Well, it is\r\neasy to call names, but the following passage indicates, at least, that\r\na British Government was not ashamed once upon a time to preach much the\r\nsame doctrine:\r\n\r\n    “While you describe the power and wealth of your country, you\r\n    will, in all your interviews with the African chiefs and with\r\n    other African natives on the subject of the suppression of the\r\n    slave trade, abstain carefully from any threat or intimidation\r\n    that hostilities upon their territory will be the result of\r\n    their refusal to treat.... You will allow for any hardness of\r\n    feeling you may witness in them on the subject of the slave\r\n    trade, a hardness naturally engendered by the exercise of that\r\n    traffic, and in some cases increased by intercourse with the\r\n    lowest and basest of Europeans. You will endeavour to convince\r\n    them by courtesy, by kindness, by patience, and forbearance of\r\n    your most persevering desire to be on good terms with them.”[80]\r\n\r\nAt what period, and under what circumstances, has this persevering desire\r\nto establish friendly terms, as a basis upon which to work to do away\r\nwith the internal slave-trade of Nigeria by the exercise of courtesy,\r\nkindness, patience, and forbearance been consistently applied, or been\r\ngiven a fair chance? We should be hard put to it to supply even one\r\ninstance, in a given district.[81]\r\n\r\nSo much for the moral aspect of the question. There is another aspect to\r\nwhich the most unsentimental of mortals will not deny the attributes of\r\nseverest practicability. I refer to the effect of these wars, nominally\r\nundertaken for the suppression of slave-raiding and the upsetting\r\nof priestly theocracies in West Africa, upon the well-being of the\r\ninhabitants and upon the prosperity of the Colonies themselves. Those who\r\nmay be inclined to look into the matter may peruse with advantage that\r\nvery able volume, “Ashanti and Jaman,” by Dr. Richard Austin Freeman, one\r\ntime Assistant Colonial Surgeon and Anglo-German Boundary Commissioner of\r\nthe Gold Coast.[82] Sir Frederick Lugard in his report writes: “Already,\r\nwith the removal of the fear of the Fulani, each petty village is\r\nclaiming its ancient lands, or raiding those of its weaker neighbour, and\r\ninterminable feuds are the result.” That passage entirely confirms Dr.\r\nFreeman’s opinion with regard to the forcible splitting up of the Ashanti\r\nconfederation after the Wolseley expedition. The latter part of it is\r\nalmost word for word that of a letter which lies before me at the present\r\nmoment, and which I received from an Englishman in the Niger shortly\r\nafter Sir George Goldie’s brilliant but inconclusive campaign against\r\nNupe. “The whole country is confused”—wrote my correspondent—“the central\r\nauthority having been suppressed; each man raids on his own.” In point\r\nof sober fact, almost every war waged in West Africa has a deteriorating\r\neffect, unless it be followed immediately by constructive action, which\r\nin the vast majority of cases is impossible owing to the vastness of the\r\ncountry. We read of a chief falling foul of the British Authorities and\r\nbeing deposed. If captured, he is marched off to the coast and deported;\r\nif he succeeds in escaping, the chances are he will rally some followers\r\nround him and prove a source of trouble for a considerable time. However\r\nthat may be, he is at any rate replaced by some other individual who may\r\nor may not have, according to local custom, a right to the chieftainship.\r\nA resident with a small escort may or may not be left in the capital.\r\nNow, bearing in mind that in Nigeria a district over which a particular\r\nchief holds at least a nominal sway is sometimes as large as Wales or\r\nlarger, no great amount of imagination is required to picture what but\r\ntoo often happens. Let us, for the sake of argument, consider Wales an\r\ninland kingdom, and imagine it under the feudal system, the King aided\r\nby his barons ruling the country, with many abuses no doubt, but still\r\nruling it after a fashion and able to make his power felt. At a given\r\nmoment the King quarrels with a neighbour. The neighbour enters the\r\ncountry, defeats the King’s armies, marches on the capital, captures\r\nit and the King together. The King is taken away a prisoner and the\r\nconqueror remains in the capital with a small force, ignorant of the\r\nlanguage of the people, of their history, traditions, customs and laws.\r\nHe will not be attacked because it is known that his soldiers possess\r\nweapons which kill easily at 300 yards, which mow down men in heaps, and\r\nwhich it is as futile to attempt to face as it is to stand against the\r\nroaring tornado hurtling through the forest. But for obvious reasons\r\nit is also known that he cannot effectively hold the country. Result\r\nnumber one: all semblance of authority within gun-shot of the capital has\r\ndisappeared. Result number two: every ambitious baron develops schemes of\r\naggrandisement, starts foraging in the property of his neighbours, who\r\ndo ditto with religious unanimity; another party remains faithful to the\r\ndeposed King and intrigues to get him back; another may take the part of\r\nthe dummy appointed by the conqueror, presuming that step to have been\r\nadopted. Sequel: disorganisation, widening of area of disturbance, social\r\nchaos, impoverishment of the country.\r\n\r\nThis is not, indeed, the exception but the rule in West Africa. The\r\nfacts are on record. I have quoted two eminent authorities in specific\r\ninstances and mentioned one other case. But the examples are numerous,\r\nand were it necessary one might amplify them considerably. Sometimes\r\nthe effect is chiefly commercial, as in the case of Nana, ex-chief of\r\nLower Benin.[83] Since his removal after the war in that district the\r\nvolume of trade has fallen considerably, which has been a bad thing,\r\nof course, all round, from the point of view of both revenue and\r\ncommerce. Speaking generally, the only logical outcome of a punitive\r\nexpedition in West Africa is the replacing of what has been pulled down\r\nby something else which shall answer to the needs of the people in the\r\nsame way, or a military occupation of every yard of the country. West\r\nAfrica being what it is, the thing cannot be done, and the consequence\r\nof punitive expeditions in that part of the world, no matter what the\r\nmotives, alleged or real, may have been, is ninety times out of every\r\nhundred reactionary, sterile, and morally destructive. Hence, whether it\r\nbe a matter of slave-raiding or fetishism, or disputes about land, or\r\ndifficulties about trade, punitive expeditions are things to be avoided,\r\nand the Administrator who avoids them is the type of man which West\r\nAfrica needs most.\r\n\r\nA reference to the question of slave-raiding in Nigeria would be\r\nincomplete without mention being made of domestic slavery, or more\r\nproperly termed domestic servitude. I remember assisting, not so\r\nlong ago, at a lecture by a missionary on Northern Nigeria. With\r\ngreat impressiveness the lecturer announced that a large proportion,\r\nfour-fifths I think he said, of Hausas in Nigeria are slaves. There was\r\nno doubt of the effect of the statement upon the audience, composed\r\nof benevolent, well-meaning people, who conjured up at once the\r\nmost horrible visions. The mere enunciation of the fact, or alleged\r\nfact—because, from what I have been able to ascertain, the estimate\r\nis widely exaggerated—is calculated to horrify a public ignorant of\r\nthe nature and characteristics of domestic slavery in West Africa, and\r\nthere can be as little doubt that such is the deliberate and perfectly\r\nsincere intention of the individuals who make these bald statements, as\r\nthat their after consequences upon the public mind are harmful. All are\r\nagreed that the intestine warfare which results in the capture of many\r\nprisoners and their conveyance over large distances always involves great\r\nhardships and sorrow, and very often fearful sufferings upon the victims.\r\nBut the weight of evidence is decidedly against the supposition, still\r\nso widely entertained, that domestic slavery in West Africa is what the\r\nunscientific advocates of its hasty abolition, regardless of the obvious\r\npolitical objections to such a course, would have the public believe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANDINGO MUSLIMS]\r\n\r\nNay more, while it may be fully admitted that a condition of servitude\r\nis indicative of a state of society which we happily have grown out\r\nof, and which in itself is essentially opposed to the moral law, no\r\nimpartial student will be prepared to deny that the condition of tens of\r\nthousands of toilers in this country is infinitely worse than anything\r\nwhich prevails under the West African native system, where poverty at\r\nleast is normally non-existent. The latter, it is true, are technically\r\nfree, but to them actual freedom would, if exercised, lead to starvation\r\npure and simple. They are bound in chains more enduring than any forged\r\nby native blacksmiths in Nigeria. The “White Slaves of England” was an\r\nappropriate title to a series of terrible articles published a short time\r\nago in a popular London magazine, the absolute accuracy of which has\r\nsince been acknowledged. “The West African slave”—a celebrated French\r\nexplorer and administrator has said—“is not so unhappy as many people\r\nwho live round us and whom _we will not see_.” That is the simple truth.\r\nBetween the domestic servitude of Nigeria—where any form of paid labour\r\nis unknown as a native institution—and plantation slavery under European\r\nsupervision there is all the difference in the world. Compared with the\r\nlatter, the former is relative bliss. Degradation was the keynote of\r\nthe one. The other permits and frequently leads to equality between the\r\nowner and the servant. Under the European system the slave was a dog and\r\nworse than a dog; under the West African system the slave is part and\r\nparcel of the social life of the people, a member, and not unfrequently\r\nan honoured member, of the family.[84] With the second generation, the\r\ndistinction between the owning and serving class in West Africa is less\r\npronounced, and with the third generation, if it has not already been\r\npractically effaced, the distinction is simply theoretical. Slaves then\r\nown slaves of their own, while still theoretically remaining slaves\r\nthemselves. Once a slave is incorporated in a household he usually\r\nremains a fixture, is decently treated, and, if his conduct is good,\r\nhis material prosperity rapidly increases. It is the commonest thing in\r\nthe world for a slave to rise high in his master’s favour, and even to\r\nhold lucrative and responsible positions. All the relations of domestic\r\nlife in three-fourths of the Niger territories are based upon the system\r\nof domestic slavery, and there is no question which requires to be\r\napproached by the authorities with greater breadth of comprehension, with\r\ngreater largeness of views, with a more sincere resolve to resolutely\r\nset aside all appeals, by whomsoever uttered, to bigotry, passion, or\r\nprejudice.\r\n\r\nThe harm which hasty legislation tending to violently interfere with the\r\nentire social fabric of a people and with a custom centuries old entails\r\ncannot be exaggerated. It spells utter disorganisation, and has already\r\nworked incalculable mischief in the British West African possessions by\r\ndestroying the authority and influence of the chiefs and breaking up the\r\nwhole labour of the country. The lesson has been learned rather late in\r\nthe day, and there is hope that it will bear fruit, but the influences on\r\nthe side of error are very strong at home, and it never seems to occur to\r\nthose amongst us whose profession in life is the inculcation of the moral\r\nvirtues, that we have no greater right to destroy or abolish domestic\r\nslavery without compensation of some sort, if only that of substituting\r\nrailway transport and portable currency in West Africa, than we had in\r\nthe West Indies or in South Africa. Why should West Indian planters and\r\nCape Colonists receive compensation for the loss of their slaves, and\r\nthe African chief nothing—except bullets? The policy of the sword and\r\nthe application of twentieth-century legislation to twelfth-century\r\nconditions, however good the intentions, are, in the main, Imperial\r\nmistakes, for which England may indirectly pay, but whom the present\r\ngeneration of natives and the generations which come afterwards do—and\r\nwill—suffer in their persons. “It is understood”—cabled Reuter’s agent on\r\nthe Binue on September 21, 1901, subsequent to the capture of Yola—“that\r\nGovernment will not interfere for the present with domestic slavery, the\r\nevil effects of such a policy being still felt in the provinces of Nupe\r\nand Ilorin. It upset the internal economy of the whole country, and the\r\nmale slaves, instead of working on their master’s farms, became rogues\r\nand vagabonds, and the women something worse.” What a biting satire upon\r\nthe notion that immemorial customs can be changed by a stroke of the pen\r\nwithout breeding disorder and social chaos! The question of domestic\r\nslavery in Nigeria may best be approached by once again recalling\r\nthat great truth, “God’s design in the perfecting of man’s mind is\r\nevolutionary and not revolutionary.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS OF NIGERIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difficulty in estimating the producing capacity of the enormous\r\nterritory of Nigeria is not in stating what _natural_ products of\r\neconomic value grow there, but what do not. Nigeria is the tit-bit of\r\nWest Africa, and practically every form of vegetable growth peculiar\r\nto West Africa, or shared by West Africa with other and less favoured\r\ntropical portions of the globe, is to be found within its extensive\r\nlimits. A soil of surpassing richness; numerous waterways, a prolific,\r\nindustrious population—all the elements are there to make of Nigeria\r\nunder wise management a second if smaller India, but an India unvisited\r\nby drought, or those fearful scourges which are so terrible a drawback to\r\nthe internal prosperity of India; perchance a happier, richer India.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the oil-palm industry, everything is in its\r\nearliest stages in Nigeria. Development is rudimentary. Deducting palm\r\noil and kernels, the value of the whole of Nigeria’s exports in 1900—the\r\nonly year available—amounted to the relatively small sum of £212,457.\r\nRubber, ivory, timber, ground-nuts, fibres, coffee, cocoa, gum copal\r\nand shea butter are amongst the other products exported. The white\r\nsweet-smelling flowers of the rubber vine are one of the commonest sights\r\nin the forests of Nigeria. The tree, shrub and vine rubber are all met\r\nwith. The value of rubber exported from Nigeria in 1900 was £137,289.\r\nIt may increase to almost any figure if the authorities will but take\r\nwarning by the sad experience of Lagos, enlist a brigade of trained\r\nrubber-workers to instruct the chiefs in the science of collecting,\r\nand prevent—which they can easily do—grossly adulterated rubber from\r\nleaving the country, and so preserve a high standard of quality, for,\r\nin the present sorry condition of the rubber market, low-class rubbers\r\nare almost unsaleable. Here, again, one is compelled to preach, if it\r\nbe for the fiftieth time, co-operation between the officials and the\r\nmerchants. In French Guinea, the evils of adulteration (for which, by\r\nthe way, the merchants were, I am afraid, primarily responsible) have\r\nbeen successfully combated by a working partnership, so to speak. It is\r\nnot necessary to impose restrictions upon the freedom of the native in\r\ncollecting this product in his forests, but it is essential to maintain a\r\n_permanent_ staff of native rubber-collecting instructors. It would cost\r\nvery little, and the experiment, if patiently and intelligently pursued,\r\nwould give magnificent results.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to rubber comes ivory, which, however, must be\r\nregarded as a temporary commerce. Almost the whole of the ivory trade\r\nof Nigeria hails from the Binue region, and for many years Yola was the\r\nprincipal buying depôt of the Niger Company, as much as forty tons being\r\nsometimes purchased there in the course of the year. The consequences of\r\nthe Anglo-German Agreement of 1893 and the Franco-German Convention of\r\n1894 are calculated to greatly diminish the trade. The ivory business\r\nis entirely in the hands of Hausa traders, who make, or used to make,\r\nmost of their purchases in the famous markets of Banyo, N’Gaundere, and\r\nTibati, carrying the teeth overland to the Binue and then conveying them\r\nacross the river, to dispose of either at the Niger Company’s pontoon at\r\nYola or factories at Ibi, Lake Bakundi, Lau, and Amageddi, or at Kano,\r\nwhere it was sold for cloth and found its way eventually to Europe,\r\n_viâ_ the desert route and Tripolitan ports. This is still done, but,\r\nfor the reason stated, the volume of trade is almost certain to diminish\r\nas the years go on. When the ivory is sold to the Niger Company, English\r\nmanufactured cloths are purchased in exchange, and this again is bartered\r\nby the Hausa traders against the superior article of native make in Kano.\r\nSometimes salt, tobacco, copper-rods, and gunpowder are in request\r\nby the ivory traders, instead of cloth. It is always an open question\r\nwith Hausa traders which pays them best, the single transaction if they\r\nsell direct at Kano, or the double transaction involved by sale to the\r\nNiger Company. The chief currency of these regions is now the cowry\r\nshell, and cowries have a native market price just like anything else;\r\nfor example, a hundredweight of salt will equal 25 heads of cowries, or\r\nroughly 12_s_. 6_d_. When a tusk is brought to the factory it is weighed\r\non a butchers’ steelyard. The tariff per pound is 10 heads of cowries.\r\nIf the tusk weighs, say, 28 lb., it fetches 280 heads of cowries, about\r\n£7, or £560 per ton in barter goods, but the price actually paid for\r\nmixed ivory in the Binue has been under £500 per ton for many years past.\r\nThe arrival of an ivory caravan is always the occasion for a great deal\r\nof excitement. Some of these caravans stretch over a mile in length.\r\nFirst comes the trader and his friends on horseback, followed by the\r\ntrader’s wives and the various members of his household. Behind them\r\ncome the slaves, weary and footsore (slaves of Hausas be it noted—not of\r\nFulani), struggling under their valuable loads. The tusks are carried\r\nsometimes on the heads and sometimes upon the shoulders. Of course, these\r\ncaravans can only travel in the dry season, for during the rains the long\r\nmarches would be attended with enormous difficulty. There are plenty of\r\ntricks in the ivory trade, and our Hausa friend is very fond of putting\r\nheavy substances in the hollow of the tusks, knowing well that if he is\r\nundetected the increased weight will add to his profit. The Hausas call\r\nivory “owry”[85] and elephants “giwa.” They very often bring the flesh of\r\nthe animal, which fetches higher prices in the native markets than beef\r\nor mutton.\r\n\r\nGums, of which there exist many different kinds in Nigeria, also\r\nconstitute a source of future riches. There is gum arabic (_Acacia\r\nsenegalensis_) which oozes from the bark—much like sap from a venerable\r\ncherry—and the “copals” found in solidified, translucent lumps, by\r\ndigging at the roots of acacias, and which sometimes fetch as much\r\nas £80 per ton on the European markets. Very beautiful some of these\r\nspecimens are, varying in colour from pale lemon to deep orange-yellow,\r\nand clear as the finest amber. These graceful gum-trees form in many\r\nplaces a notable feature of Binue scenery, and abound in many parts of\r\nBornu, and it is not an unusual circumstance for a Bornuese cavalcade,\r\nincluding several individuals wearing the old-world surcoats of chain\r\narmour which has so excited the interest and curiosity of travellers in\r\nthat country, to arrive at a trading-station on the Upper Binue with a\r\nload of gum arabic for sale. The natives of Hamarua (Muri), too, are\r\nnoted gum-collectors. As in the case of almost all Nigerian products,\r\nthe absence of competition among European purchasers (the Niger Company,\r\nit must always be remembered, has been the sole trader in these regions)\r\nhas hitherto prevented the natives from bringing in very large quantities\r\nof gum, and where ivory is to be got, it is hard to induce Hausas to\r\ngo in for laborious gum collecting and picking. There can be little\r\ndoubt whatever that the gum trade is susceptible of being increased to\r\nthousands of tons per annum. The supplies must be almost inexhaustive.\r\nAfter many years of assiduous collection, the Kauri pine forests of New\r\nZealand still furnish 8,000 to 10,000 tons per annum of fossil gum, more\r\nor less similar to the West African “copals.” It can be said without\r\nfear of exaggeration that there are hundreds of thousands of tons of\r\nthis valuable product in West Africa waiting to be dug up. One fine\r\nday the fact will be better realised than it is at present, and we may\r\nthen expect to see a remarkable development in the product. Among other\r\nvaluable trees freely growing in Nigeria, but of which the economic\r\naspects have not yet been thoroughly studied, two at least deserve\r\nspecial attention. They are the Kedenia (Kedenya) or Shea-butter tree\r\n(_Butyrospermum_ or _Bassia parkii_[86]—the _beurre de Karité_ of the\r\nFrench), sometimes, and erroneously, called the tallow-tree, and the\r\npapain or paw-paw (_Carica papaya_). Shea butter has of late appeared as\r\na regular if small export from the Niger.[87] Large forests of it are to\r\nbe found in the Lagos hinterland, and also in Dahomey, where the French\r\nhope to exploit it when their railway enters the zone of production.\r\nShea butter fetches about £24 to £26 per ton in Europe. It contains\r\ncertain medicinal properties of a purgative nature, I believe, and is\r\nsaid to form a component part of the well-known Elliman’s Embrocation.\r\nBy the inhabitants of Nigeria the butter of the Kedenia is held in high\r\nesteem, and is put to a number of varied uses: medicinally, for cooking\r\npurposes, &c. The Fulani dose their horses internally with it, and\r\nalso rub it on the sores which the cumbrous high-peaked saddles of the\r\ncountry frequently produce on the backs of their steeds. The Kanuri, or\r\nBornuese, use it to light their lamps with, and other tribes believe\r\nit to be a sure cure for rheumatism. There seems to be a possibility\r\nof the shea-butter tree being put to a second use; recent experiments\r\nhave shown that the latex furnished by this tree contains properties\r\nsimilar to gutta-percha.[88] The butter- or tallow-tree (_Pendatesma\r\nbutyracæ_), which is often confounded with the shea-butter tree, is an\r\nentirely different tree, belonging to the genus _Guttifera_, whereas the\r\nshea butter is of the genus _Sapotacæ_. The French appear to have been\r\nthe first to make any economic use of this tree, and for the first time\r\nlast year, when a trial shipment of nuts was forwarded from Conakry to\r\nMarseilles by the leading French firm of merchants in the former place.\r\nThe nuts when crushed were found to yield a valuable oil possessing\r\ningredients which render it particularly applicable for the manufacture\r\nof candles. That wise and brilliant administrator, the late Dr. Ballay,\r\nGovernor-General of French West Africa, left a legacy of priceless worth\r\nbehind him in the shape of officials reared in his school and imbued with\r\nhis sentiments, and M. Cousturier, the present very able Governor of\r\nFrench Guinea, has taken up this subject of the tallow-tree nut—“lamy”\r\nas it is called—most energetically, in co-operation with the council\r\nof merchants established in that Colony. My latest information on the\r\nsubject is that further shipments of “lamy” nuts from French Guinea have\r\ntaken place to Marseilles, Hamburg, and Bremen, and that the prospects of\r\ndisposing of the nuts to seed-crushers at remunerative prices is assured.\r\nIt remains to be seen whether the nut can be produced in adequate\r\nquantities in French Guinea. I have not been able to positively ascertain\r\nwhether the tallow-tree occurs in Nigeria, but there is every probability\r\nthat it does, and if so, it will be another vegetable product of value to\r\nbe added to Nigeria’s long list.[89]\r\n\r\nSeldom is it that on village market-days in Nigeria the golden\r\npear-shaped fruit of the _paw-paw_ does not appear for sale. The natives\r\nlook upon paw-paw fruit in the double light of a delicacy and article\r\nof considerable utility. The juicy milk of the fruit, and the large,\r\nhandsome leaves contain the singular property of making hard meat tender,\r\na peculiarity which has given rise to many “travellers’ tales” on the\r\ncoast. The toughest steak is rendered soft and agreeable to the palate\r\nby being rubbed with the juice of the paw-paw, or wrapped round in its\r\nleaves. The active principle of the dried juice of the paw-paw is\r\nsomewhat akin in nature to pepsin, and is regularly used as a substitute\r\nfor the latter in France and Germany. So far, the demand is small, but\r\nthere seems every likelihood that it will increase. In connection with\r\nthe future development of the paw-paw in Nigeria, it is interesting to\r\nnote that a small factory for the preparation of pepsin from this fruit\r\nhas been established within recent years in the Island of Montserrat.\r\nIn addition to the trees already mentioned, the kola (_Sterculia\r\nacuminata_, sometimes termed the _Sterculia cola_), the gutta-percha,\r\nthe giant baobab (_Adansonia digitata_) or monkey bread-fruit tree, and\r\nthe bamboo palm (_Raphia vinifera_) must be briefly touched upon. The\r\nkola-nut is to the Fulani, the Hausa, the Kanuri, the Songhay, &c., what\r\ncoffee is to the Arab and opium to the Chinese—a never-failing panacea.\r\nSo indispensable is the kola to the daily existence of the native of\r\nNorthern Nigeria, so enormous the demand, that the Hausa journeys\r\nthousands of miles to the districts of the Niger bend (the Gold Coast\r\nhinterland chiefly), and even to the Gambia hinterland and the valley of\r\nthe Senegal, to barter his blue cottons for this much-sought-after fruit.\r\nEuropean science will, no doubt, eventually succeed in so improving the\r\nquality of the Nigerian kola as to make these long journeys yearly less\r\nnecessary. Kola plantations should then become a lucrative feature of\r\nNigerian industry.\r\n\r\nGutta-percha is as valuable an article of commerce, and as greatly\r\nin demand for European manufactures, as rubber itself. In Nigeria\r\ngutta-percha is collected immediately the rainy season is over, the sap\r\nat that time of year flowing more freely from the tree. In coagulating,\r\nthe milk assumes a reddish tinge.\r\n\r\nThe baobab has been aptly termed the monarch of the African vegetable\r\nkingdom. From the bark of the _kuka_, as the Hausas call it, excellent\r\nropes and strings for musical instruments are fashioned, while the\r\nfruit, when crushed and dried, furnishes the natives with an excellent\r\nsubstitute for sponges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BAOBAB\r\n\r\nTHE GIANT OF WEST AFRICAN FLORA]\r\n\r\nVast groves of the bamboo palm (_R. vinifera_) exist in many parts\r\nof Southern Nigeria, and although but little utilised at present,\r\nexperiments have demonstrated that the fibre derived from the branches\r\nof this palm is capable of producing an excellent and durable bass[90]\r\nsomewhat similar in quality to that which is obtained from the allied\r\nspices, the _Raffia ruffia_ of Madagascar, the demand for which on the\r\nEuropean market is already extensive.\r\n\r\nDate palms, dum palms, and cocoa-nut palms, lemons, bananas, plantains,\r\nsweet potatoes, yams, sugar-cane, hemp, tobacco, benni seed,[91] pepper,\r\ncassada, castor seed, capaiva—Nigeria produces all these in more or less\r\nabundance, according to the locality, and also ground-nuts and large\r\nquantities of capsicums (red pepper). The valuable indigo plant is widely\r\ncultivated by Hausas and Fulani, and Kano owes much of its wealth to the\r\ndyeing industry carried on by the natives. The native-woven Kano cloth,\r\ndyed a deep indigo blue, is renowned all over Northern, Western and\r\nCentral Africa. With European skill, the cultivation of indigo in Nigeria\r\nmay possibly have a future before it, although the present outlook is not\r\nencouraging.\r\n\r\nThe cotton shrub grows luxuriantly in Northern Nigeria, and the cloth\r\nmanufactured from it by the natives can favourably compare, for\r\ndurability and fineness of texture, with the best Manchester article.\r\nThere may yet be a great cotton industry in Nigeria, but the subject of\r\ncotton cultivation in West Africa is sufficiently large to justify a\r\nspecial chapter.\r\n\r\nEbony, mahogany and other valuable cabinet woods abound in the enormous\r\nuntapped forests of Southern Nigeria, and if no peddling restrictions are\r\nplaced upon the development of the timber industry, it should reach large\r\nproportions. Sapelli is beginning to have some importance as the foremost\r\nport of shipment for Southern Nigeria timber.\r\n\r\nNigeria also produces cereals in plenty, such as maize or Indian corn,\r\nmillet, rice, barley, guinea corn, gero, &c., and on the high plateaux\r\ncoffee, tea, and perhaps vanilla could be grown.\r\n\r\nAs far as minerals are concerned, silver,[92] tin, antimony and stone\r\npotash[93] are known to exist in several parts of Nigeria, but none\r\nof them, save the latter, have been worked. When the country has been\r\nbetter explored and surveyed, gold and copper may also be found (small\r\nquantities of gold dust are sometimes sold by the Kanuri to Fezzan and\r\nGhadamseen merchants), but their presence in any extent is at present\r\nproblematical.\r\n\r\nTin is known to exist up the Binue, and an English Syndicate has been\r\nformed to explore and report upon the tin-bearing possibilities of\r\ncertain districts. The Niger Company are about to start prospecting\r\noperations, and the Germans are also said to be studying the same subject\r\nat Garua.\r\n\r\nSuch, briefly enumerated, are the chief natural products of Nigeria,\r\nthe most fertile and prolific portion of the Central African Continent,\r\ntowards which has gravitated a commercial movement from north, east and\r\nwest for centuries past. Such eminent authorities, in their respective\r\nways, as Barth, Nachtigal, Monteil, Thomson, &c., speak in terms of\r\nunbounded admiration of the fruitfulness and the beauty of these regions,\r\nand all the information brought by travellers and explorers of lesser\r\nimportance only tends to confirm the assertion of the great geographer\r\nReclus, that the countries of the Chad Basin are the richest in Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nRUBBER-COLLECTING IN NIGERIA\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already briefly alluded to the vegetable products of Nigeria. The\r\ncollection of rubber, however, presents many features of interest, and\r\ndeserves more extended treatment.\r\n\r\nOf late years the West African rubber industry has grown enormously. In\r\nsome cases the increase has been phenomenal. The Niger Coast Protectorate\r\nand the Gold Coast have within the space of six years more than doubled\r\ntheir rubber exports. The performance of Lagos has been still more\r\nremarkable, although unfortunately the wastefulness, or perhaps it would\r\nbe fairer to say the lack of scientific knowledge on the part of the\r\nnatives in tapping the trees and vines, has led to a notable falling off\r\nin production during the last three years. It seems evident that Western\r\nAfrica may in time rival Brazil as the rubber-producing country of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe rubber found in West Africa is of various kinds. The place of honour,\r\nso far as our own Colonies are concerned, may be given to the rubber-tree\r\nproperly so-called, _Kickxia Africana_ (the “Ere” or “Ireh” of the\r\nnatives), and a beautiful tree it is, springing up clean and smooth to a\r\nheight of sixty feet. Then come various species of _Ficus_, and last, but\r\nnot least, the _Landolphias_, or rubber-vines.\r\n\r\nIn Nigeria rubber is found, roughly speaking, from Abutshi, 120 miles up\r\nthe river Niger, as far as Jebba on the Niger and Yola on the Binue. We\r\nwill suppose that a rubber-collecting expedition has been decided upon by\r\nthe inhabitants of some village fifteen or twenty miles from the river\r\nside (rubber in Nigeria is scarce on the actual river banks).\r\n\r\nSoon after dawn all the available men and women gather together—a\r\nlight-hearted, jabbering crowd. Extraordinary animation reigns throughout\r\nthe village. The ground is strewn with the implements necessary to the\r\nrubber-collector’s art, and with the victuals essential to the sustenance\r\nof his body while the work is being pursued. They include such varied\r\narticles as calabashes, “matchets,” knives, dried yam in bags, and fresh\r\nwater in bottles which once contained that delectable, throat-peeling\r\nliquid known as Hamburg gin. Mingled with them, in apparently hopeless\r\nconfusion, numerous spears and flint-lock guns lie scattered. There\r\nis generally something or other on the prowl in an African forest in\r\nthe shape of leopards, or “humans,” or spirits—and it is just as well\r\nto be prepared for any emergency. Hence these warlike accompaniments,\r\ncalculated to deceive the inexperienced into a belief that raiding and\r\nnot rubber is in question.\r\n\r\nThrough the village and beyond it, passing plantations of millet, yams,\r\nIndian corn and cassava, winds the caravan, until the fringe of the\r\nforest looms near. Then, abruptly parting with the bright sunlight and\r\nthe waving fields, we plunge headlong into an atmosphere of gloomy,\r\nfantastic weirdness, and disappear amid the silent shadows of the giant\r\ntrees. By this time the caravan is reduced to single-file formation. It\r\nhas stretched out for a mile or more along the narrow curling path, which\r\noften takes the form of an almost complete circle, those who compose its\r\nextreme rear being within hailing distance of the leaders, while between\r\nthe two extremities and the centre is a broad belt of impenetrable bush.\r\nAnd what a solemnity broods over all! Everything is hushed. The bare\r\nfeet of the natives sink noiselessly on generations of fallen, rotting\r\nleaves. The air is damp, humid, and enervating. We glide along in the\r\nsemi-religious light as though oppressed by some vast, undefined, awesome\r\npresence. It is a world of great black shadows and mysterious depths; and\r\nwithin it the soul shrinks and falters beneath a weight of indescribable,\r\nall-potent, unnerving melancholy. A hot breath, laden with sickly and\r\noverpowering perfume, rises in stifling gusts till the brain reels, and\r\nyou long with a great yearning for air and light and waving fields.\r\nAnd then, suddenly, a glimpse of Paradise. Shattered by lightning, or\r\nperchance, riddled by the larvæ of some monstrous coleoptera, a forest\r\ngiant has tumbled headlong, tearing by the impetus of his fall a great\r\nrent in the sombre dome above, through which, though chastened and\r\nsubdued, the sun’s rays filter down upon the path beneath. There, in that\r\ntemporary clearing, Nature seems to have lavished all her gifts. Festoons\r\nof glorious orchids stretch out their capricious blooms, asking to be\r\nplucked. The wild tamarind, with its exquisite, plum-coloured, plush-like\r\nfruit, invites the touch. Round flowers and fruit flutter countless\r\nbrilliantly coloured butterflies, and the glimpse of a deep tropical\r\nblue, far, far overhead, completes the fairy sight. No palm-fringed oasis\r\namong shifting sands can be more blessed to the traveller than these\r\ngem-like clearings amid the sullen gloom of the tropical forests of\r\nWestern Africa.\r\n\r\nBut to return, with apologies for this digression, to our\r\nrubber-collectors. No sooner has the member of a caravan—every one acts,\r\nas a rule, independently of his fellow—pitched upon a spot which seems\r\npropitious, than down comes the load off his head. A little preliminary\r\nin the shape of refreshment is ever conducive to good labour, so recourse\r\nis had to the _ci-devant_ gin-bottle and the dried yams. These inner\r\ncravings having been satisfied, the rubber-collector makes with his\r\n“matchet” a number of transverse incisions in the bark of an adjacent\r\nrubber-tree, or vine,[94] as the case may be; hangs his calabashes (empty\r\ngourds) beneath the cruel rent, sees that the sap is running; looks\r\nround for more trees, makes more incisions, hangs up more calabashes;\r\nand then, feeling fully satisfied with his labours, casts himself down\r\nupon the ground and lies there awhile, heedless of the crawling legions\r\nof the insect fraternity. Every now and then he will lazily rise and\r\nmake the round of the trees he has tapped, to assure himself that the\r\nsap is flowing freely into the calabashes. A really good workman will\r\ncollect three or four pounds of rubber a day, so that, taking an average\r\nof, say, two pounds for each individual, a caravan numbering one hundred\r\nand fifty souls will gather a considerable quantity of the stuff in a\r\ncomparatively short time. The sap is then boiled in an iron pot to make\r\nit coagulate, salt and lime being sometimes added to help the process of\r\nsolidification. It is then rolled into balls. When the calabashes are\r\nfull the homeward march begins.\r\n\r\nThe home-coming of the caravan is marked by congratulations on the part\r\nof those who stayed behind, and every proud owner of a calabash or two\r\nof rubber recounts to the members of an admiring household the wild and\r\nterrible adventures (in the shape of spooks, leopards, and what not)\r\nwhich have befallen him in the forest.\r\n\r\nThe last stage in the business, so far as the native is concerned, has\r\nthen to be carried out. The rubber having been collected, it must be\r\nsold. So off goes the collector to the nearest trading station with the\r\nspoil. Now, if the commercial ways of the Heathen Chinee are dark, the\r\nways of the Heathen son of Ham are much the same on occasion. The rubber,\r\nhe knows, is bought by weight. Primitive reasoning convinces him that if\r\nhe rolls his rubber round a stone or bullet, not only will the ball weigh\r\nmore, but he will be able to make more balls out of the rubber he has\r\ncollected. The consequence is that the European trader, when he cuts the\r\nrubber ball in two (being used to these little pranks), frequently comes\r\nacross a stone, bullet, or other heavy substance embedded in the centre,\r\nto the unbounded astonishment, needless to remark, of our friend the\r\ncollector, who cannot for the life of him understand who placed it there,\r\nand asserts, with much emphasis and gesticulation, that only a ju-ju or\r\nspirit of the most depraved character could have played an honest man so\r\nlow-down a trick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WASHING RUBBER]\r\n\r\nWhen the rubber has finally passed into the white trader’s hands, after\r\nthe preliminary native preparation, it is still found to contain a\r\nlarge proportion of water (about 10[95] per cent.) and emits a most\r\ndisagreeable odour. This water has to be ejected before the rubber is\r\nfit for the European market. The balls or cakes are therefore placed in\r\na pressing machine, resembling an ordinary mangle, then cleaned of the\r\nimpurities which may still remain, and finally cut into strips, soaked in\r\nsea-water to prevent “sweating,” and shipped in wooden casks.[96]\r\n\r\nThe rubber trade of Nigeria is only in its infancy, and the advent of\r\ncompetitive private enterprise into the Niger territories should have the\r\neffect of stimulating the industry to a notable extent.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate destruction of the rubber trees and vines in the Lagos\r\nforests has been instrumental in producing a _furor_ of restrictive\r\nlegislation on the part of the authorities. There is grave doubt as to\r\nwhether this method of approaching the subject is not mistaken and likely\r\nto defeat its own ends. It is incongruous, to say the least of it, to\r\nfirst of all encourage the native to exploit a new product, to give him\r\nno scientific instruction or training in the process, and then, when\r\nthe inevitable happens, to express great indignation at his villainous\r\ncapacity for mischief, and frame legislation calculated to interfere\r\nwith his free use of his own property! It is not the general custom of\r\nthe native to destroy a product out of which he makes money. In the case\r\nof the oil-palm, in the usage of which they have been long accustomed,\r\nthe native chiefs themselves legislate against over-tapping, witness the\r\n“porroh” of the Mendis. It is a matter of instruction. It is notorious\r\nthat the crisis in the Lagos rubber industry is entirely attributable\r\nto the gross foolishness displayed by the authorities in the first\r\ninstance in not taking the necessary means to teach the natives the art\r\nof rational production. What is wanted is the creation of small centres\r\nof instruction in every district, where the natives could come for\r\ninformation, where various products could be shown, tested and commented\r\nupon. The official in charge would have no powers whatever conferred\r\nupon him in a political sense, but would be connected, of course, with\r\nthe Government. His duty would be that of instructor, supervisor, guide,\r\nand assistant. He would certainly be welcomed by the chiefs, so long as\r\nthey were assured that his _rôle_ was entirely divorced from political\r\ndesigns. The experience would cost very little, and the benefits accruing\r\ntherefrom, both as regards the perfecting of existing native industries\r\nand the stimulation of new ones, would be considerable, and would do away\r\nwith the necessity, or alleged necessity, of subsequent legislation of an\r\nirritating character. A little more of that sort of thing and a little\r\nless blood-letting and “murder of native institutions,” as Miss Kingsley\r\nused to put it, in order to improve them, would be very desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE FULANI IN NIGERIA\r\n\r\n    “Remember that Paradise is found under the shadow of swords.\r\n    These wretches are come to fight for an impious cause. We have\r\n    called them into the right way, and to reward us they threaten\r\n    us with arms. Meet this attack with courage and be certain\r\n    of victory for the Prophet has said, ‘Even if a mountain is\r\n    guilty against another mountain, it is swallowed up in the\r\n    earth.’”—The speech of OTHMAN, the Fulani conqueror of Hausa,\r\n    to his soldiers on the outbreak of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The King of Gober took many of their cows. The Phulas said nothing. He\r\nreturned again to seize their cows. The Phulas said, ‘Is it right on us\r\nto take vengeance?’ But the King of Gober took some of their cows and\r\nreturned them to them, saying, ‘Let there be peace between us; you leave\r\nthis place and return to some place near me.’ They replied they would not\r\ngo. In the morning he commenced fighting with them, with one thousand\r\nhorse soldiers to seize the Phulas; but they drove him back with great\r\nforce. From that time he did not make open war with them again; but he\r\nbrought poison, put it into the water, and all who did drink of it died.\r\nAfter this the Phulas made war with him, and when they had conquered\r\nhis people, they caught many of them and made them slaves; in this way\r\nit was that the Phulas got possession of Gober. In the same way it was\r\nthat they sent their people to all parts of Hausa and fought with the\r\nPagans.”[97] Thus does a native version explain the origin of the great\r\nFulani uprising in the Hausa States in the early part of last century\r\nwhich started a great wave of Muslim conquest, sweeping southwards from\r\nthe Chad Basin almost to the ocean. “We will dip the Koran in the sea,”\r\nswore the conquering host of white-clad horsemen, and but for the\r\nconcentration of the agricultural Yorubas, which checked their advance\r\nand led to their overthrow, by a night surprise, outside the walls of\r\nOsogbo,[98] they would have fulfilled their vow.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Fulani revolution—misnamed by some “invasion”—in Hausa\r\nhas been often told, sometimes correctly,[99] sometimes with obvious\r\nbias against the reformers, and _minus_ several important facts, such,\r\nfor instance, as the co-operation which the revolutionists sought and\r\nfound among the Hausas themselves. To describe it once again would be\r\nsuperfluous. Suffice it to say that “victims of persecution,” as their\r\nown records assert and as Barth confirms, and as we are at least as\r\nwarranted in believing as those other accounts which make them out to\r\nbe the oppressors rather than the oppressed; in much the same position\r\nof social and political inferiority to men whose intellectual superiors\r\nthey are, as their compatriots find themselves to-day in Borgu, the\r\npastoral Fulani of Northern Nigeria, remembering the performances of\r\nother of their brethren when similarly situated, and acting under the\r\ninfluence of their mallam Zaky, or Othman Dan Fodio, to give him his\r\nEuropean appellation, flung aside the crook, took to the sword, and with\r\nthe name of “Allah” on their lips completely subjugated in a few short\r\nyears the mutually antagonistic Hausa States, made themselves masters of\r\nthe principal cities, converted the natives to Islam, and so ably and\r\njustly administered the country,[100] that, in Clapperton’s words, “The\r\nwhole country, when not in state of war, was so well regulated that it\r\nwas a common saying that a woman might travel with a cask of gold upon\r\nher head, from one end of the Fellatah[101] dominions to the other.”[102]\r\nFrom cattle rearers and herdsmen the Fulani temporarily became warriors,\r\nadministrators and statesmen, a minority retaining these attributes to\r\nthis day, while the bulk of the people continue their usual avocations.\r\nTheir capacity for combination enabled them to overcome the Hausa States,\r\nperpetually engaged in intestine quarrels; their statesmanship induced\r\nthem to foster and encourage the caravan trade with the Tripolitan ports;\r\ntheir administrative genius was observable in a hundred ways, not the\r\nleast in obtaining their revenue by the maintenance of existing forms of\r\ntaxation.[103] Their intense religious zeal has been so communicative\r\nthat the Hausas have never even fractionally relapsed into Paganism.[104]\r\nWhen we contemplate the achievements of the Fulani in Nigeria we are lost\r\nin wonder, and there is no difficulty in endorsing what Sir Frederick\r\nLugard has said of them—and what many French administrators and officers\r\nhave said before him—“they are born rulers and incomparably above the\r\nnegroid tribes in ability.” What potent allies these men can be to the\r\nwise administration which makes use of their services in Western Africa,\r\nwhich gains their confidence and enlists their sympathies!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FULANI SWORD]\r\n\r\nThe wholesale manner in which the Fulani have succeeded in stamping\r\ntheir individuality upon the races with whom they have come in contact\r\nis astonishing. Everywhere in their wonderful _trek_ from east to west,\r\nand from west to south, from the valley of the Senegal to the valley of\r\nthe Binue, new and more virile generations have sprung up beneath their\r\nfertile tread, destined in the course of time to found for themselves\r\nseparate kingdoms, almost to become separate nationalities. Thus in\r\nFuta Jallon, that mountainous region abounding in the fine cattle the\r\nFulani themselves introduced in the sixteenth or seventeenth centuries,\r\nand which before the French occupation supplied the Freetown markets\r\nwith fresh meat, we find the Fulani powerfully affecting the ethnic\r\nelements of the country by their unions with the indigenous Jalonkes and\r\nMandingoes. In Senegambia, a well-nigh distinct race has arisen in the\r\nTukulors, Fulani crossed with Joloff and Mandingo. Hausas and Kanuri of\r\nBornu, Tuareg of the southern confederations, and Susus from the Northern\r\nRivers[105] have all received an infusion of Fulani blood. And yet the\r\npure Fulani element has preserved itself, and while absorbing countless\r\ntribes and becoming itself greatly modified in certain districts,\r\nhas succeeded in perpetuating the parent strain which has never been\r\nabsorbed.[106] At the present time may be found, scattered throughout the\r\nWestern Sudan, in the Futa Jallon highlands, and in the regions abutting\r\nupon Lake Chad—in Adamawa notably—the same type of nomadic herdsmen,\r\nrefined, hospitable and courteous in demeanour, simple and patriarchal in\r\nhis habits, with clear-cut features and copper-coloured or olive-tinged\r\ncomplexion, who tended his hump-backed cattle and roman-nosed sheep a\r\nthousand years ago in the oasis of Tuat and the plains round Timbuctoo.\r\nAnd by his side, his wives, rejoicing in a greater degree of liberty and\r\nauthority in the household than any of their African sisters, with the\r\ncharm of another land upon them, soft-eyed, spice-loving daughters of the\r\nEast, from whence they came in those dim and distant days shrouded in\r\nimpenetrable mist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PURE-BRED FULANI GIRL, ADAMAWA]\r\n\r\nThe history of the Fulani is not confined to Nigeria. Their rise to power\r\nin the old Hausa States, and the foundation of the Sokoto Empire is, as\r\nwe have seen, quite a modern event, and it is only partially accurate\r\nto say that their dominating influence in inland Western Africa dated\r\nfrom the Jihad of Othman. The latter’s successes certainly inspired the\r\nFulani (but perhaps more especially the cross races of Fulani blood)\r\nwest of the Niger to warlike deeds. The Fulani revolution in Hausa was\r\nfollowed by the Fulani uprising in Segu against the pagan Bambarras\r\nand Soninkes. Timbuctoo fell into their power in 1826. Mohammed Lebo\r\nstarted a crusade in Massina, directed as much against the pagans as\r\nagainst his co-religionists and compatriots, for their lack of zeal and\r\nthe impurities which had crept into their religious observances. After\r\nMohammed Lebo, the great Tukulor chief, El-Haji-Omar, a man of remarkable\r\nability, belonging to the fanatical sect of the Tijaniyah, gathered\r\nan immense host around him, by means of which he waged war on all and\r\nsundry, showing particular animosity towards the parent stock from which\r\nhe sprang. But his religious zeal was untempered by political purpose,\r\nhis constructive powers appear to have been small, he fought entirely for\r\nhis own hand, and his collision with and subsequent defeats by the French\r\nresulted in the revolt of those who had suffered from his excesses. It\r\nis a curious fact that he should have finally been driven to desperation\r\nand suicide, and his power extinguished, by the Fulani themselves,\r\nnotwithstanding the ties of blood which bound them to the Tukulors, from\r\namong whom Omar naturally obtained most of his recruits. Nevertheless,\r\nEl-Haji-Omar is still a name to conjure with in the Western Sudan, and\r\nother adventurers of his type have from time to time given the French\r\na deal of trouble. But the Fulani had been masters in a considerable\r\nportion of Western Africa long before Othman raised his standard in\r\nGober of Hausa. In the next chapter endeavour will be made to search\r\nthe earliest records throwing light upon the presence of the Fulani in\r\nWestern Africa. This will help us to approach the problem of the origin\r\nof a race which constitutes the ruling factor in the foremost, in point\r\nof size and importance, of the British Protectorates in West Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE FULANI IN WEST AFRICAN HISTORY\r\n\r\n    “In every kingdom and country on each side of the river there\r\n    are some people of a tawny colour called Pholeys.... They live\r\n    in hoards or clans, build towns, and are not subject to any\r\n    kings of the country, though they live in their territories:\r\n    for if they are ill-treated in one nation they break up their\r\n    towns and remove to another. They have chiefs of their own, who\r\n    rule with so much moderation that every act of government seems\r\n    rather an act of the people than of one man.... They plant near\r\n    their houses tobacco, and all round their towns they open for\r\n    cotton, which they fence in together; beyond that are their\r\n    corn-fields, of which they raise four kinds.... They are the\r\n    greatest planters in the country, though they are strangers in\r\n    it. They are very industrious and frugal, and raise more corn\r\n    and cotton than they consume, which they sell at a reasonable\r\n    price, and are very hospitable and kind to all; so that to have\r\n    a Pholey town in the neighbourhood is by the natives reckoned a\r\n    blessing.... As they have plenty of food, they never suffer any\r\n    of their own nation to want; but support the old, the blind,\r\n    and lame equally with the others; and, as far as their ability\r\n    goes, assist the wants of the Mandingoes, great numbers of whom\r\n    they have maintained in famines.”—FRANCIS MOORE on the Fulani\r\n    of the Gambia (1734).\r\n\r\n    “A race in which self-reliance and colonising instincts are\r\n    prominently developed. Education and mental training are\r\n    carefully attended to. In every town and village are men who\r\n    devote themselves to the instruction of youth. Nearly every man\r\n    and woman can at least read Arabic. Under the enlightened rule\r\n    of Alimami Ibrahim Suri, life is held in reverence, property\r\n    is sacred, robbery committed in the highway is punishable with\r\n    death.... There is a woman in Timbo who knows the whole of the\r\n    Moallaket by heart, an accomplishment in Semitic lore which\r\n    many an Oriental scholar in Europe might envy.”—DR. BLYDEN on\r\n    the Fulani in Futa-Jallon.\r\n\r\n    “They occupy a high place in the scale of intelligence.”—BAIKIE\r\n    on the Fulani of Northern Nigeria.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest mention we have of an Empire existing in West Africa is\r\ncontained in the _Tarik_,[107] a history of the Western Sudan, written\r\nin the seventeenth century by one Abderrahman ben Abdallah ben Imran\r\nben Amir Es-Sa’di, and apparently ascribed by Barth in error to the\r\ncelebrated _savant_ of Timbuctoo, Ahmed Baba. That Empire was the Empire\r\nof Ghanata, so called from its capital Ghana, which has been identified\r\nwith Walata or Biru. The spread of the Empire was enormous and extended\r\nto the Atlantic, embracing the valleys of the Senegal and the Gambia.\r\nGhana was situate in the central province of the Empire, by name Baghena,\r\nthe modern Bakunu according to Commandant Binger. The _Tarik_ states\r\nthat twenty-two kings had reigned in Ghanata prior to the Hejira. Barth\r\napproximated the foundation of Ghanata to 300 A.D. It was attacked and\r\ndefeated in the eighth century[108] by a Berber tribe (Zanaga, Senhaja?),\r\nthe invaders subsequently succumbing, at what period is obscure, to\r\nthe Mandingoes—or Mandingo-Fulani, _i.e._ Tukulors—who from its ruins\r\nconstructed another Empire which grew to even larger proportions, that\r\nof Melli, Melle,[109] or Mali, as it is variously spelt. Who were the\r\noriginal founders of the Ghanata or Walata Empire?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FULANI CHIEF—FUTA JALLON]\r\n\r\nDr. Robert Brown, in his most admirable edition of Pory’s translation of\r\nLeo,[110] says: “Walata is the Arab and Tuareg name, while Biru is the\r\none applied to it by the Negro Azer, a section of the Aswanek, who are\r\nthe original inhabitants of the place.” At the time the above was written\r\nno complete copy[111] of the _Tarik_ was obtainable, and Dr. Brown was\r\nunable consequently to consult the work, and to observe how closely\r\nit corroborates Barth’s famous chronological history of the Songhay.\r\nHad he done so the passage in question would, no doubt, have undergone\r\nmodification, for the _Tarik_ distinctly tells us that the name of the\r\noriginal founder of the Ghanata (Walata) dynasty was Quaia-Magha,[112]\r\nand Magha, as M. O. Houdas points out, is a Fufulde word meaning “great.”\r\nThus it is legitimate to assume, in view of the absence of rebutting\r\nevidence, that the original founders of probably the oldest Empire in\r\nWest Africa, of the first Empire at any rate of which record is left\r\nto us, were of Fulani blood. In any case, it would appear to point\r\nconclusively to the existence of the Fulani language, and therefore to\r\nthe presence of the Fulani in the Senegal region of West Africa from the\r\nvery earliest times.\r\n\r\nIt may be argued that a single word is a slender basis upon which to\r\nconstruct a theory. But when it is borne in mind (1) that the ensuing\r\nhistorical record of the very same region, 1500 years later, viz.\r\nthe arrival at the court of the Bornuese king Biri of two religious\r\nchiefs _of the Fulani of Melle_, proves the presence of the Fulani in\r\nthe country which the _Tarik_ asserts was ruled over by a king with a\r\nFulfulde[113] affix to his name; (2) that every successive account,\r\nboth Arabic and European, referring to the same region corroborates the\r\ncircumstance, it will be conceded that the assumption goes far beyond\r\nmere plausibility. There is every reason to believe that the Fulani\r\nwere numerous in the Empire of Melle[114] (if, indeed, the rulers of\r\nthat Empire were not of mixed Fulani blood, which seems probable[115]),\r\nsometimes in the ascendant, sometimes the under-dogs, according as their\r\npolitical fortunes rose and fell.[116] In the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury they were certainly the ruling race in Baghena (the central\r\nprovince, as already stated, of the Ghanata Empire, which seems to have\r\npreserved its name subsequent to the Mellian conquest), having succeeded\r\napparently in getting the upper hand. We know this from the Songhay\r\nrecords, which tell us that at that period Askia, the powerful Songhay\r\nking, “conquered Baghena and slew the Fulani chieftain Damba-Dumbi.”[117]\r\nThirty years before that event the chief of Baghena was also a Fulani,\r\nas is testified by the records of Askia’s predecessor. About 1450\r\nCa-de-Mosto speaks of “el rey dos Fullos” on the banks of the Senegal.\r\nLater on, John II. of Portugal sends an embassy to Tamala, “powerful\r\nking of the Fulas.” De Barros, the Portuguese historian, refers to a\r\ngreat war, “incendia de guerra,” in the Senegal country (1534). Masses of\r\nFulani, says de Barros, left the country of “Futa”—probably Futa-Toro—in\r\na southerly direction. So numerous was the host, he continues, that\r\n“it dried up the rivers in its passage.” Marmol also refers to this\r\nsouthward movement. The Fulani, “who had raised so formidable an army\r\nin the southern parts of the province of ‘Fura’ (Futa) which borders\r\non Mandingo, which they were marching against, that they pretended it\r\ndried up rivers.”[118] No doubt that was the beginning of the Fulani\r\nmigration into Bondu and Bambuk, to be followed at a subsequent period\r\nby a continuation of the movement into Futa-Jallon. The _Tarik_ gives us\r\nthe story of the foundation of the Fulani State of Toro by Salta Tayenda,\r\n“the false prophet,” in 1511.[119] According to the _Tarik_, the Fulani\r\nwere ruling as far eastward as Masina in the fifteenth century, and\r\nBarth’s chronological table of the Songhay mentions an expedition by a\r\nSonghay king against the Fulani of Gurma, still farther east.\r\n\r\nComing to a later period, we have Jobson (1628) talking of the Fulani\r\nas oppressed by, and in subjection to, the Mandingoes in the Gambia\r\nregion. In 1697 the Sieur de Brüe pays his first visit, on behalf of\r\nthe French Senegal Company, to the court of the Fulani ruler on the\r\nSenegal River. Labat’s description of the event is most picturesque.\r\nThey were the days when African monarchs were treated with respect by\r\nthe European who desired to trade with their subjects. Even the cynical\r\nprelate to whom we are indebted for the relation of Brüe’s voyage, and\r\nwho chuckles over the small villainies practised upon the Fulani by\r\nthe Company, expresses astonishment with the Fulani institutions, the\r\njudiciary and administrative systems, the agricultural and commercial\r\naptitude of the inhabitants. “As far as the eye could reach,” he says,\r\nquoting from Brüe’s papers, “not an inch of ground was left uncultivated\r\nor neglected.” Farther on he speaks of “vast plains covered with cattle.”\r\n“They”—the Fulani—he continues, “cultivate the soil with care and make\r\nabundant harvests of large and small millet, cotton, tobacco, peas and\r\nother vegetables, and they rear prodigious quantities of cattle.” In\r\nshort, we find the same well-defined characteristics in the Fulani Empire\r\nin the Senegal of the seventeenth century as are observable in their\r\nEmpires of more recent date. Herdsmen and agriculturists by nature, they\r\nproduce, when circumstances have placed the government of the countries\r\nin which they have settled into their hands, a class of statesmen and\r\nadministrators.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HALF-CASTE FULANI GIRL—FUTA-JALLON]\r\n\r\nI have quoted a considerable number of authorities—the list might easily\r\nbe extended—to show that the Fulani have lived in the Senegal and Gambia\r\nregion from remote times, and that their identification by the _Tarik_,\r\nand by Barth, with the Ghanata Empire, estimated by the latter to date\r\nback to A.D. 300, is, therefore, inherently probable. From the region\r\nin which they have alternately been rulers and ruled, and where they\r\nreside to-day under French domination, the Fulani have gradually spread\r\nthemselves south and east, throughout almost the entire region of inland\r\nWestern Africa. The movement continues and is one of the most interesting\r\nethnological factors in Western Africa. On the west, the forest belt has\r\nprevented the Fulani from reaching the ocean, although on two occasions\r\nthey were very nearly doing so, from behind Lagos in the middle of last\r\ncentury, as mentioned in the previous chapter; from behind Sierra Leone\r\nabout thirty years before their defeat at Osogbo, their cavalry (as in\r\nYoruba) being ineffective against the opposition of the forest dwellers,\r\nSulimas and others—the free Negroes of the Sierra Leone Protectorate,\r\nupon whom Downing Street in its wisdom imposed a property tax in 1898.\r\nAshanti tradition mentions the advent of “red men” from the interior as a\r\ncontributive cause of their migration southward.[120] To-day the Fulani\r\nhave reached the borders of the great Congo forest, and according to some\r\naccounts are present in very large numbers on the Sangha River.[121] Will\r\nthey seek to penetrate the forest or will they turn aside, oblique to the\r\nnorth,[122] once more and, as though impelled forward by an inscrutable\r\ndecree of Providence, gravitate imperceptibly towards the spot where they\r\ncrossed into the Dark Continent from Asia, and first set foot upon that\r\nAfrican soil which for some four thousand years has been their home?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE FULANI\r\n\r\n    “The most interesting of all African tribes.... A distinct\r\n    race.”—DR. BARTH, “Travels in Central Africa” (5-volume\r\n    edition).\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the mysteries which lie hidden, or but half unveiled, within the\r\nbosom of the still mysterious Continent of Africa, there is none that\r\npresents a more absorbing or more fascinating interest than the origin of\r\nthe race which has infused its individuality throughout inland Western\r\nAfrica, and whose fertilising influence is visible from the banks of the\r\nSenegal to the Chad.\r\n\r\nIn the previous chapter it has, I venture to believe, been fairly\r\nestablished that the Fulani are indubitably associated with our earliest\r\navailable records of Western Africa, and that, with the exception of\r\nHanno’s narrative (touched upon presently), every important reference,\r\nspread over many centuries, to the portion of Western Africa between the\r\ntenth and twentieth parallels of North latitude, bears witness, directly\r\nor indirectly, to the presence of the Fulani within that region at a\r\nremote period.[123] Whence came this people, which differentiates so\r\nradically in colour, form, habits, customs and manners from the Negroes\r\namong whom they have settled, and which dominated in the valley of the\r\nSenegal as far back as the fourth century?\r\n\r\nTheir own legends; their complexion and structure; their mental\r\ndevelopment and physical characteristics, all point emphatically to the\r\nEast as the cradle of the Fulani race; a “distinct race,” as Dr. Barth\r\ntruly says, and not the bastard product which some would make out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOW-CASTE FULANI, WESTERN SUDAN]\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to piece together the various threads which in the\r\naggregate amount, in my humble opinion, to a virtual demonstration, it\r\nmay be well to state that the Eastern theory numbers opponents who,\r\nfrom their position and attainments, compel our attention. There are\r\nthose who entertain the belief that the Fulani belong to the Berber\r\nstock. There are others who think—and this I cannot but regard as wildly\r\nimprobable—that the Fulani are of Nigritic extraction. M. Marcel Dubois,\r\nthe brilliant author of “Timbuctoo the Mysterious,”[124] whose treatment\r\nof the Fulani is anything but impartial, categorically denies the Eastern\r\ntheory. “It was from the West,” he says, “from the Senegalese Adrar\r\n(Aderer of British maps), from the land of sand extending north of the\r\nSenegal that they came.” “The Foulbes,” he continues, “had been driven\r\ntowards the Sudan, very probably when the Moors, expelled from Spain,\r\ninvaded Adrar.” M. Dubois finds corroboration of his views in a passage\r\nof the _Tarik_ (which, being written by an Arab, is necessarily biased\r\nagainst the Fulani) to the effect that the “Foulbes originated in the\r\ncountry of Tischitt.” I venture, very respectfully, to differ from M.\r\nDubois. According to Leo, the Moors or Berbers conquered Ghanata in the\r\neighth century, the ruling caste at that time, as both the _Tarik_ and\r\nalso Barth’s records lead us to infer, being of Fulani blood, which in\r\nitself casts doubt upon M. Dubois’ assertion. But the more one endeavours\r\nto reconcile M. Dubois’ contention with existing records, the less sound\r\ndoes it appear. The Moorish power in Spain was not finally extinguished\r\nuntil towards the close of the fifteenth century. Nevertheless, it may be\r\nsaid that the Moorish cause was lost in Europe, and that their expulsion\r\ncommenced with the defeat of Salado in 1340.[125] We can, therefore,\r\nfor the sake of argument, take the middle of the fourteenth century as\r\nthe period, approximately, when the Moors began to be “expelled from\r\nSpain.” This would be about the time when, in M. Dubois’ view, the Moors\r\nwere driving the pastoral Fulani towards Aderer, “the land of sand.”\r\nNow, apart from the self-evident contradiction of a people whose wealth\r\nhas ever been in their flocks and herds, originating in an arid district\r\n(sand not usually being associated with pastures), the Fulani were in\r\npoint of fact already considerably farther south. Was not the market of\r\nJenne (on which M. Dubois has himself thrown such a glamour of interest)\r\nattended as early as 1260 by Fulani?[126] Did not the King of Bornu\r\nreceive a Fulani deputation from Melle between 1288 and 1306?[127] Is it\r\nconceivable that the Fulani, compelled to evacuate Aderer in the middle\r\nof the fourteenth century, would have ruled over vast tracts of territory\r\nas far south as Gurma, only one hundred years later? M. Dubois will have\r\nto bring forward a great deal of evidence—certainly something more than\r\nhis own assertion, and an obscure passage in the _Tarik_—to upset the\r\nEastern theory of Fulani origin.\r\n\r\nOf native traditions among the Fulani attributing an Eastern origin\r\nto their race we have no end, and although too much significance need\r\nnot be attached to them, they must not on that account be overlooked.\r\nThere is generally a foundation of truth in native legends of this\r\nkind. Anthropometrical studies, or rather craniological studies, are,\r\nhowever, extremely valuable. Although carried out to a small extent\r\nso far, they appreciably strengthen the Eastern theory. Dr. Verneau,\r\nwhose reputation as an anthropologist is well known, has recently\r\npublished[128] the results of an examination of five skulls of Fulani\r\nchiefs from Futa-Jallon. The first three belonged to individuals known,\r\nwhen alive, to the French authorities of that Colony. The other two were\r\nbrought home by Dr. Maclaud, who has travelled extensively among the\r\nFulani, and to whom I am indebted for several of the photographs here\r\nreproduced. None of the originals were Fulani of the pure type. The one\r\napproaching nearest to purity was Alfa-Alliu, who was condemned to death\r\nfor an unprovoked attack upon a French convoy. Of this individual’s\r\nskull, Dr. Verneau reports: “Alfa-Alliu belongs by his cranial and\r\nfacial characteristics to the sur-based (vaulted) pentagonal type which\r\nenters into the composition of the present population of Erythria and\r\nthe ancient population of Egypt.” Of two other skulls out of the five\r\nexamined, Dr. Verneau remarks: “Their owners, no doubt, had a certain\r\namount of negro blood in their veins, which resulted in a thickening of\r\nthe osseous frame and in a notable prognathous accentuation....[129]\r\nNevertheless, these two chiefs were not negroes; the width of the\r\nforehead, the prominence of the bones of the nose, the proportions of the\r\nnose itself, and the form of the chin, preclude any connection.” Of the\r\ntwo remaining skulls, Dr. Verneau concludes thus: “I will not further\r\ninsist upon the cephalic character of these two deeply crossed Fulani.\r\nI would merely observe that, notwithstanding the mixed breed, they\r\npresent two cranial forms which we find wherever the influence of the\r\nEthiopians has been felt.” It is necessary to add that by “Ethiopian,”\r\nDr. Verneau—as he is careful to explain in the opening lines of his\r\npaper—designates the Abyssinian type, holding that the synonymy given to\r\nthe terms “Negro” and “Ethiopian” is a popular confusion. Élisée Reclus,\r\nin his great geographical work, also states that the formation of the\r\nFulani cranium has affinities with the Egyptian type. To this testimony\r\nmay be added, that the most recent studies in Berber anthropometry\r\ntend to divorce the Berbers from the ancient Egyptian and the Eastern\r\nstock.[130]\r\n\r\nDr. Blyden, who visited Timbo (the capital of Futa-Jallon, one of the\r\nmost important Fulani centres in West Africa) in the seventies, and who,\r\nlike Dr. Bayol and others, was immensely impressed with what he saw,\r\nremarks in a report to the Government of the time (to which I have been\r\nable, through the doctor’s kindness, to have access): “On entering a\r\nFulah town the first thing which strikes a stranger is the Caucasian cast\r\nof features, especially among the older people; yet every now and then,\r\nin the children of parents having all the physical traits of the Semitic\r\nfamily, there recurs the inextinguishable Negro physiognomy.”[131] “It\r\nis evident,” the doctor goes on to say, “that while there is a large\r\ninfusion of foreign blood among the people, there is still the influence\r\nof a powerful race-stock which has thoroughly assimilated the alien\r\nelements, and this may be judged from the strong pride of ancestry which\r\nthey possess, their respect for the past and their care for posterity.”\r\n\r\nD’Eichtal sought to trace in the Hovas of Madagascar a relationship with\r\nthe Fulani, which would, obviously, connect them with the Malays—the\r\nobject of d’Eichtal’s treatise. The sole basis of the theory was a chance\r\nsimilarity in certain words; but were d’Eichtal right, we should have\r\nto admit a complete reversal of the cycle of Fulani migration, which is\r\nquite impossible. Fulfulde cannot as yet be definitely classed among\r\nthe languages, but, so far as our knowledge extends, it has Semitic\r\nantecedents. When we endeavour to find some other links, connecting the\r\nFulani with the East, several circumstances arrest our attention. The\r\nfirst is provided in a passage of Hanno’s “Periplus”; the second, in\r\nthe invasion of Lower Egypt by the Hyksos; the third, in the Hebraic\r\ntendencies and peculiar familiarity with Hebrew legends observed among\r\nthe Fulani; the fourth, in an attachment to their cattle so remarkable\r\nas to suggest a far-off bovine worship. These points may be severally\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PURE-BRED FULANI GIRL—FUTA-JALLON]\r\n\r\nWhen, towards the close of the sixteenth century B.C., the rulers of\r\nCarthage conceived a scheme of over-sea colonisation which should\r\nredound to the glory of the Empire and free it at the same time from a\r\nportion at least of the undesirable elements of the population, they\r\ndespatched an armada of sixty ships containing some thirty thousand\r\nsouls, under the command of a worthy magistrate of the name of Hanno,\r\nwith instructions to pass through the Pillars of Hercules (the Straits of\r\nGibraltar) and to lay the basis of a colony somewhere beyond them. The\r\nfleet appears to have navigated the West Coast of Africa until it reached\r\nthe Senegal, the Carthaginians proceeding for some little distance up\r\nthat river, subsequently pushing southward to the Gambia and farther\r\nstill to the “Southern Horn,” which it has been sought to identify with\r\nSherbro Sound.[132] This meeting of Phœnician culture with aboriginal\r\nprimitiveness on the West Coast was, as Sir Harry Johnston has strikingly\r\nput it, “The first sight that civilised man had of his wild brother since\r\nthe two had parted company in Neolithic times.” And yet in one respect\r\nthis general statement is open to doubt. It was not only Negroes with\r\nwhom the Carthaginian navigator came in contact.\r\n\r\nOn his return, Hanno wrote an account of his wanderings, in the Punic\r\ntongue, termed a Periplus or circumnavigation, which he dedicated to\r\nMoloch, the deity of the Carthaginians, in the Temple of Cronos. Through\r\nthe enterprise of Greek scientists, the relation of Hanno’s voyage\r\nhas been preserved to us. About three centuries after its completion,\r\nPtolemæus Claudius, a Greek geographer and historian, published eight\r\nvolumes of geographical research. The portion relating to Africa was\r\nmainly founded upon Carthaginian material and included a translation of\r\nHanno’s “Periplus.” From Ptolemy’s description, we gather that in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Gambia (Stachir) the Carthaginians came across a\r\npeople of a lighter hue than the Negroes. These people the author calls\r\n“Leucæthiopes.” Pliny also speaks of the “Leucæthiopes,” placing them,\r\nhowever, a couple of degrees farther north. Thus five hundred years B.C.,\r\nCarthaginian navigators reported in West Africa the existence of a people\r\nto whom the epithet of “black” did not apply, in the same region in which\r\neight hundred years later—that being the first reference to West Africa\r\nwhich has come down to us—we hear of an Empire whose rulers were “white,”\r\nfounded by a monarch with a Fulfulde affix to his name.\r\n\r\nWho could those light-complexioned “Africans” have been? Not, assuredly,\r\nArabs; still less Bantus. With the Berber tribes the Carthaginians were\r\nin touch everywhere, in Mauritania, Numidia, Cyrenaica. From the Berbers,\r\nCarthage drew her mercenaries, who often enough proved more dangerous\r\nthan useful. The colonists would have recognised the type had they met\r\nwith it in West Africa, and if the “Leucæthiopes” had been Berbers they\r\nwould have been differently described in the “Periplus.” Indeed, there\r\nis some ground for believing that the colonists numbered Berbers among\r\ntheir ranks. Moreover, the Berber occupation could not at that time have\r\nextended as far south, by at least fifteen degrees, as the Senegal-Gambia\r\nregion. There is not, so far as I am aware, any record extant suggesting\r\nthe presence of the Berbers in the valley of the Senegal until the eighth\r\ncentury A.D. To what race, then, could the “Leucæthiopes” have belonged?\r\nTo what race but the Fulani, to whom the description given by Hanno could\r\nalone—bearing in mind the period of the expedition—by any possibility\r\napply? That is link one.[133]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FULANI HOUSE—FUTA-JALLON]\r\n\r\nThe invasion of Lower Egypt by the Hyksos or Shepherd Kings from the\r\nEast is one of the obscurest stages of Egyptian history. Professor\r\nLepsius believed that the invasion of the Shepherds occurred during the\r\nthirteenth dynasty (which, according to the same authority, began in 2136\r\nB.C.), and ended about 1626 B.C. with the expulsion of the Shepherds.\r\nAbout 2000 B.C. then—a little earlier or a little later, according to\r\nother authorities—Egypt, being at that time under the Theban dynasty,\r\nwas invaded by vast hordes of Asiatics, who brought with them enormous\r\nquantities of cattle and sheep.[134] It would seem as though some great\r\ninternal convulsion, the cause of which can only be conjectured, had\r\nprecipitated into the fertile valley of the Nile a number of nomadic\r\npastoral tribes, by nature herdsmen, shepherds and agriculturists, but\r\nconverted for the time being either through famine, scarcity of pastures,\r\npressure of other tribes behind them, or spontaneous race-expansion,\r\ninto a warlike and conquering people which swept onward in irresistible\r\nstrength until they reached a land suitable for their herds—their only\r\nwealth. The distinctive character of their occupation is preserved in\r\ntheir name—Hyksos or Shepherd Kings. After a sanguinary struggle, the\r\ninvaders succeeded in fairly establishing themselves in Lower Egypt, and\r\ngradually extended their influence over Upper Egypt, where, however, they\r\nwere unable to gain complete mastery. Their supremacy lasted about five\r\nhundred years. They were finally overthrown and driven out of the country\r\nby the representatives of the old Theban dynasty under Misphragmuthosis\r\nand Thoutmosis, somewhere about 1636 B.C., if we adopt the estimate of\r\nthe celebrated Egyptologist, Professor Lepsius. What became of them? The\r\nEgyptian scribe, Manetho, contends that they crossed back into Asia,\r\nbut the statement is very doubtful, and his further assertion that they\r\noccupied Judea and founded Jerusalem is scouted by the learned.\r\n\r\nIs it not legitimate to suppose that a portion, at any rate, of\r\nso enterprising and courageous a people, which must have been\r\nextraordinarily numerous to have held sway over Egypt for so considerable\r\na period, should have preferred to plunge into the unknown West, in\r\nsearch of fresh territories where their herds might find sustenance,\r\nrather than ignominiously return in the direction from whence they came?\r\nFor five hundred years Africa had been their home. Africa offered them\r\nextensive pastures for their cattle. They must have largely mingled and\r\nintermarried with the Egyptians. Family and historical ties bound them\r\nto the African soil. They had become adopted children of that Continent,\r\nwhich in all ages has exerted a peculiar fascination over the various\r\nimmigrant peoples that have entered it. History, I believe, contains not\r\none single instance of a people which, having once settled in Africa,\r\nhas left it again. The Shepherds had risen in Africa to a position of\r\nparamountcy. Out of the undisciplined host which spread itself like a\r\ntorrent over the Nile Delta, a race of statesmen had evolved capable\r\nof ruling what was perhaps the mightiest Empire of the then civilised\r\nworld. It is incredible to imagine that a whole people could have been\r\ndriven in a fixed direction, as Manetho would have us believe. Tens of\r\nthousands must have been employed, as their compatriots the Hebrews were\r\nemployed, by the victorious Thebans, in raising those mighty monuments of\r\nstone whose ruins to-day provoke the wonder of all men. Many more must\r\nhave escaped westwards, and gained with their belongings the fertile\r\nplains of inland Cyrenaica, and, through the ages, pushed on and on,\r\never seeking pastures new, until in the course of a thousand years the\r\nCarthaginians found their descendants in the rich valleys of the Senegal\r\nand Gambia—with their national characteristics preserved, their “powerful\r\nrace stock” unimpaired, their “strong pride of ancestry” remaining, their\r\nways adapted to their new environment.\r\n\r\nOthers again may have migrated south and have largely influenced\r\nthe composite ethnic elements of Erythria, of which the nomadic\r\ncattle-rearing Wahuma of Uganda would appear to be an offshoot—the\r\nAsiatic origin of the latter being generally admitted. So much for link\r\nnumber two.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the Hyksos in Lower Egypt was approximately contemporaneous\r\nwith Hebrew emigration from Mesopotamia to Palestine. Three hundred years\r\nlater, in 1700 B.C. according to Biblical records, when a grievous famine\r\nlay upon the land, the famous Israelitish _trek_ into Africa began, upon\r\nthe direct invitation of Egypt’s ruler, in whose employ Joseph had risen\r\nto a position of great influence. The new-comers established themselves\r\nin the fertile province of Goshen,[135] east of the Nile, where the\r\nriver branches as the prongs of a fork. Who was the reigning Pharaoh\r\nat the time? The gap in Egyptian history unfortunately prevents an\r\nanswer. But that, unless the most competent Egyptologists are hopelessly\r\nwrong, he was one of the Shepherd Kings, cannot be doubted. And, apart\r\nfrom the similarity of dates, there are inherent reasons which still\r\nfurther fortify what may almost be said to be a certainty. The Hyksos\r\nwere a conglomeration of Asiatic herdsmen whom circumstances had forced\r\ninto the valley of the Nile. The _rôle_ of warriors and administrators\r\nwhich they assumed was probably an accident, the result of finding a\r\npowerful nation in occupation of the land they coveted, and whom they\r\nhad to subdue before being able to occupy. That they succeeded is proof,\r\nnot only of their courage but of their political genius and power of\r\norganisation—qualities for which the Fulani are to-day conspicuous,\r\nnotwithstanding the demoralising tendency of contact with intellectually\r\ninferior races. It was their political genius which led the Hyksos to\r\ninvite an influx of Israelites, Asiatics like themselves, of the same\r\nSemitic origin and the same Monotheistic leaning. The wisdom of the\r\npolicy is apparent. The Hyksos knew well that their rule was unpopular,\r\nthat the Princes of the overthrown Theban dynasty were continually\r\nintriguing against their domination in the southern provinces, and that\r\ntheir hold upon the country depended upon the number of their adherents\r\nin the north. They set themselves, therefore, to encourage Asiatic\r\nimmigration. Inversely, it was but natural that, when the representatives\r\nof the old Theban dynasty once more came into their own, the Israelites\r\nshould have been specially marked out for resentment.\r\n\r\nThe administrative seat of the Hyksos was Memphis, the city sacred to\r\nthe worship of the bull Apis. At first the Hyksos replaced the worship\r\nof Apis, incarnation of the divine Osiris, by their own divinity Set,\r\nbut they were compelled by the pressure of public opinion to allow the\r\nrevival of the national cult. After suffering a temporary eclipse,\r\nbull-worship continued as before. It is, indeed, open to question whether\r\nthe Shepherds themselves, and their compatriots the Israelites, did not\r\nend by adopting, partially at least, the divinities of the conquered. Can\r\nwe not trace, for instance, in the incident of the golden calf erected by\r\nAaron in the wilderness, and the employment of golden calves by Jeroboam,\r\nin order to symbolise the deity, the strong hold which bull-worship had\r\ntaken upon the imagination of those pastoral Semites, the Israelites,\r\nwhom the Hyksos, pastoral Semites like themselves, had invited to reside\r\nwith them in the land of Goshen? What more natural that, being herdsmen,\r\nand taught by long years of experience to look upon cattle-rearing as\r\ntheir natural avocation, the Semitic invaders of Egypt and their allies\r\nshould have been predisposed, and insensibly drifted, towards the\r\nadoption of the religion which they found existing in the country they\r\nhad conquered, and of which the chief symbolical deity was a bull?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FULANI CATTLE-PEN]\r\n\r\nNow is it not a very singular fact that the Fulani should be the only\r\npeople in Western Africa whose former religious beliefs have been\r\nassociated, by those who have lived amongst them, with an ancient\r\nbull-worship, the former cult of Egypt? The unusual regard they have for\r\ntheir cattle, even after Islam has been established among the great bulk\r\nof them for upwards of nine centuries, is singled out for special notice\r\non the part of numerous observers. Reclus deems the circumstance to be\r\nworthy of notice: “The scrupulous care,” he says, “which they devote\r\nto their cattle-pens has something in it of a religious nature.” Here\r\nand there, in the Western Sudan, tribes of Fulani are met with, whose\r\nmembers have remained pagan, and their paganism, in so far as it has been\r\nobserved, consists in a superstitious reverence for their cattle, almost\r\namounting to adoration. Among the Mohammedan Fulani the _bororo_[136]\r\nis still pre-eminently the national representative of the race, and the\r\npurest types are found among the _bororoji_, rather than amidst those\r\nof their countrymen who have become over-lords, administrators and\r\nland-owners on a large scale. “The Foola nation,” says Winterbottom, “is\r\nthe only one in this part of the coast to whom the title of _armentarius\r\nafer_ can be justly applied.”[137] Many and various are the stories told\r\nby French officers serving in the Western Sudan of the curious affinity\r\nbetween the Fulani and their cattle, an affinity which is a perpetual\r\nsubject of comment among their Negro neighbours.[138] Clapperton tells us\r\nhow the cattle respond at long distances to the shrill cry of the Fulani\r\nherdsman, who, by the way, is said never to employ a dog.[139] One of the\r\nmost remarkable French stories is that related by an officer operating in\r\nthe Baol district of the Western Sudan. In the course of a day’s work the\r\nofficer had commandeered some cattle from the natives; among the animals\r\nwas a fine black bull obtained from a group of wandering Fulani herdsmen.\r\nWhen night fell, the cattle were duly penned and a _Spahis_[140] posted\r\nas sentry over them. Towards midnight the officer was roused from sleep\r\nby the _Spahis_ informing him with much solemnity that it would be\r\nnecessary to slaughter the black bull at once. “Are you mad?” cried\r\nthe astonished Frenchman. “Not at all, Lieutenant,” replied the soldier\r\nimperturbably; “it is the cattle that are mad, for the Fulani are calling\r\nthe bull—listen.” Stepping out into the moonlight the officer listened.\r\nPresently from a neighbouring hill came the sound of a plaintive chant.\r\nAt the same moment a violent disturbance took place among the cattle.\r\nThe officer hurried towards the pen followed by the sentry, the chant\r\nmeanwhile continuing in a cadence of inexpressible melancholy. The\r\ncommotion in the pen increased, and before the Frenchman could reach it,\r\none of the beasts was seen to clear the enclosure at a bound and crash\r\nthrough the bush, following the direction of the sound and bellowing\r\nloudly the while. It was the black bull. He had broken the halter which\r\nbound him and leapt a palisade five feet high! With the disappearance of\r\nthe bull the chant abruptly ceased. Next morning the Fulani were nowhere\r\nto be found.[141]\r\n\r\nThe Hebraic flavour—if one may put it so—which seems to permeate many of\r\nthe Fulani customs, especially among the less contaminated elements of\r\nthe race, has been recorded by careful observers. A friend, an officer\r\nin the employ of the Northern Nigeria administration, who was intimately\r\nacquainted with the Fulani, whose language he spoke, and who possessed\r\nconsiderable erudition, had prepared a number of notes for me on the\r\nsubject, which, unfortunately, I never received, owing to his death while\r\nserving in Africa. One custom which had specially impressed him among\r\nthe pure Fulani was the habit of setting aside the firstborn. He found\r\nthat the Fulani woman of unmixed blood in the Binue region never suckled\r\nher firstborn, but consigned it to the care of friends, and completely\r\ndisinterested herself from its future career, while bestowing upon the\r\nsecond child, and subsequent children, the usual motherly solicitude.\r\nHe connected this singular custom with a distorted rendering of the\r\npunishment visited upon the Egyptians in the time of the Captivity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HALF-CASTE FULANI GIRL AND A SUSU]\r\n\r\nThe lecture delivered in 1886 by Captain de Guiraudon (who published a\r\nFulfulde manual, and who resided for several years in the Fulani country\r\nin Senegambia) before the seventh Congress of Orientalists contains some\r\ninteresting references to the subject under discussion. In the course\r\nof his relations with the Fulani, De Guiraudon was particularly struck\r\nwith their peculiar knowledge of Jewish history. So familiarly did they\r\nspeak of the chief Hebrew personalities of the Old Testament, and so well\r\nposted were they with the principal events related in it, that they could\r\nnot, argued De Guiraudon, have acquired their knowledge merely through\r\nArabic sources. They referred to those times as though dealing with their\r\nown national records. Moses and Abraham might have been individuals of\r\nthe same race as themselves. “In their oral legends Moses plays a very\r\nimportant part, and although certain passages of the Scriptures are\r\ntransformed or rather assimilated, they have so intense a Biblical and\r\nHebraic tone as to exclude all Arabic influence.” De Guiraudon noted,\r\nhowever, that their Israelitish chronicles ceased after Solomon. “What\r\nthey knew of the miracles of our Saviour was so distorted and erroneous\r\nas to prove that the New Testament had reached them from afar, in a vague\r\nand fragmentary condition.” De Guiraudon’s conclusions are best given in\r\nhis own words. “It would seem as if the Puls (Fulani), if they themselves\r\ndid not profess the Jewish faith, which I would rather be disposed to\r\naffirm than deny, were at least in permanent contact with the Jewish\r\npeople in remote times, and that, influenced at one time or another by\r\nthe Israelites, they received Old Testament legends directly from them.”\r\n\r\nDr. Blyden also testifies in an indirect way to the close acquaintance\r\nof the Fulani with the history of ancient Hebraic personalities. “They\r\nhold the language of the Koran,” he remarks, “in the greatest veneration,\r\naffirming that it is the language which was spoken by Adam, Seth, Noah,\r\nAbraham, and Ishmael. The descendants of Ishmael, they contend, have\r\nnever been in bondage to any man; and that during the bondage of Isaac’s\r\ndescendants in Egypt the language lost its purity and copiousness.”\r\n\r\nIt is significant that the son and successor of Othman Dan Fodio, sultan\r\nBello of Hausa, second Fulani ruler over the Hausa States, in the history\r\nof the Sudan written in Arabic characters which he gave to Clapperton,\r\ndescribes the “Tow-rooths,” who may, I think, be identified with the\r\nTorodos (a sect of Fulani greatly looked up to), as “having originated\r\nfrom the Jews.”[142] Mungo Park, when writing of his experiences among\r\nthe Mandingoes—who appear to have been converted to Islam by the Fulani,\r\nwith whom they have been in close relationship, amiable and the reverse,\r\nfor many centuries—observed a similar widespread knowledge of incidents\r\nin Old Testament history, such as the death of Abel, the lives of the\r\nPatriarchs, Joseph’s dream, and so on. Winterbottom is equally emphatic.\r\n“The customs of these people (the Fulani),” he says, “bear a striking\r\nresemblance to those of the Jews described in the Pentateuch, and after\r\nMohammed, Moses is held by them in the highest estimation.” There is some\r\nuniformity, too, between the following descriptive passages. The first is\r\nfrom Kenrick (American edition), the second from Laing’s history of the\r\nSulima people and their relations with the Fulani:\r\n\r\n    “The Jews were commanded, on the day of the Atonement, to\r\n    provide a goat to carry the sins of the people, and the\r\n    high-priest was to lay his hand on the head of the goat and\r\n    confess the national sins. So among the Egyptians whenever a\r\n    victim was offered, a prayer was repeated over its head, if any\r\n    calamity was about to befall either the sacrifices or the land\r\n    of Egypt, ‘it might be averted on this head.’”\r\n\r\n    “Musah Bah (a Fulani chief), shortly after his installation,\r\n    ordered a great feast to be held, and, inviting to it all the\r\n    head-men of Jallon Kadoo, explained to them the nature of the\r\n    Mohammedan faith and told them that the Foulahs had come to\r\n    settle in their country with a desire only to do them good and\r\n    to show them the true road to happiness. He then ordered a\r\n    large wafer of country bread and a bleeding sheep to be placed\r\n    before him, and invited all those who wished to be instructed\r\n    by the priests of Futa-Jallon to place their hands upon the\r\n    bread and touch the sheep, which all the head-men did.”\r\n\r\nThe motives were different, but the Fulani ceremonial savours greatly of\r\nthe Old Testament. So much for the remaining links.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said, I think, to show that there is a vast field open\r\nto systematic inquiry and investigation, which may possibly lead to\r\ndiscoveries of a most interesting and important kind. Having examined the\r\nlinks one by one, let us see how they look when riveted together and what\r\nconclusions they suggest. The straight-nosed, straight-haired, relatively\r\nthin-lipped, wiry, copper or bronze complexioned (“pale-gold” as one\r\nwriter puts it) Fulani male, with his well-developed cranium, and refined\r\nextremities; and the Fulani woman, with her clear skin, her rounded\r\nbreasts,[143] large eyes,[144] antimony-dyed eyebrows, gracefulness of\r\nmovement, beauty of form, coquettish ways and general attractiveness—are\r\nAsiatics. They are the lineal descendants of the Hyksos, having migrated\r\nwestwards with the overthrow of the Shepherd conquerors. Their customs\r\nbear record to their progenitors having been influenced both by the cult\r\nof ancient Egypt and by the Israelites, whose presence in the Nile Delta\r\nwas contemporaneous with Hyksos rule. Their presence in West Africa\r\ndates back at least 2500 years. To dogmatise on such a subject would be\r\nfoolish; to claim having evolved an original theory would be impertinent.\r\nBut I am not aware that the Eastern theory of Fulani origin has been\r\nhitherto worked out with any attempt at consecutiveness, or an endeavour\r\nmade to amalgamate and give in connected form—however imperfectly—the\r\nchief factors for further study which may be usefully followed up by\r\nsome one more competent than the author.\r\n\r\nAnd what is to be the policy of Great Britain, of France and of Germany\r\ntowards this wonderful race? Surely it should be dictated in the first\r\nplace by a desire to preserve. With their faults—and what race is devoid\r\nof faults?—the Fulani have admirable qualities which can fit them to be\r\nworthy and reliable co-builders and assistants in the task which the\r\nPowers have undertaken in Western Africa. Their virility has hitherto\r\nbeen equal to all the calls upon it. They retain “the strong pride of\r\nrace.” They possess in the highest degree the attributes of rulers.\r\nIt would be a misfortune indeed if, with the advent of the European,\r\npossessed of those swift engines of destruction he is at times so prompt\r\nto use in the name of civilisation, the Fulani should disappear from the\r\nregions they have leavened with their intelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nSANITARY AFFAIRS IN WEST AFRICA\r\n\r\n(By Major RONALD ROSS, F.R.C.S., F.R.S., C.B., Liverpool School of\r\nTropical Medicine.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first question which any one who has studied the history of West\r\nAfrica will ask, is this—Why has the country developed so slowly?\r\nIt is actually nearer to Europe and more accessible than several\r\ntropical countries, which have certainly progressed far more towards\r\ncivilisation—such as the West and East Indies, Central America and the\r\nseaboard of China; it is, generally speaking, a rich country; with a\r\nfertile soil, sufficient rainfall, large rivers, good harbours, fine,\r\nwell-watered plains, a vast population, and a climate not excessively\r\nhot. One would expect to find here flourishing settlements, large cities,\r\na prosperous agriculture and a great commerce; but what we really have is\r\na series of second-rate, if not third-rate, settlements which are just\r\nable to hold their own in the midst of the forests and marshes which\r\nsurround them; and a native population which can scarcely be considered\r\nother than barbarous beyond a short distance from the settlements\r\nreferred to. The discrepancy between the expectation and the fact is\r\nremarkable. India, for example, with her vast tracts of well-cultivated\r\nlands, her cities, her ports, her universities, her thousands of miles\r\nof railway, her society, and her well-organised Government is far indeed\r\nabove West Africa. If the best West African province could be transferred\r\nbodily to the East and placed alongside even such outlying parts of\r\nIndia as Assam and Burma it would look very shabby in comparison. The\r\nprincipal West African towns seen by me, Lagos, Accra, and Freetown,\r\ncannot for a moment be compared with the great Indian capitals and\r\nstations such as Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Rangoon, Secunderabad,\r\nAllahabad, Delhi, Benares, Pindi, Lahore. In general appearance,\r\nconstruction, and style of living they are on a level with such\r\n“benighted” spots as Moulmein in Burma, Nowgong in Assam, or Masulipatam\r\nin Southern India. West Africa possesses no Simla, Bangalore, Darjeeling\r\nor Ootacamund.\r\n\r\nThe whole country reminds one chiefly of the derelict Coromandel Coast\r\nminus its principal city. Yet it may perhaps be doubted whether in\r\nextent, fertility and natural resources West Africa is really far below\r\nIndia. Europe has been trading with West Africa for centuries; it has\r\nlong drawn from it many valuable commodities; it has explored it and\r\nmade settlements in it which have lasted for hundreds of years. Why has\r\nnot Europe done more for it, then? The question is really one of great\r\nimportance in the philosophical history of civilisation, especially in\r\nthese days when civilisation tends so strongly to overflow from the\r\ntemperate climates into the tropical ones. Here we have two countries\r\nequally gifted with natural resources and equally exposed to the\r\ncivilising irradiance of Europe. Yet, while India is of itself already\r\none of the great Powers of the world, the other still remains in the\r\ncondition of a newly discovered continent, to be opened up in the future.\r\n\r\nOf the three reasons usually assigned for this curious fact, the first\r\ngenerally given is that in India Europe found a certain degree of\r\ncivilisation already existing before her advent; while in West Africa\r\nshe started to work upon a completely barbarous country. No doubt\r\nthis has much to do with the result; but we must remember that many\r\ncountries now far ahead of West Africa were little or no less barbarous\r\nthan West Africa a few centuries ago—such as many portions of tropical\r\nAmerica, Burma, and the Islands of the Pacific. It can scarcely be\r\nsaid that the antecedent semi-civilisation of India and China has been\r\nalways favourable to progress, nor that a basis of complete barbarism\r\nis always fatal to it. Another reason, perhaps more frequently given,\r\nis that the natives of West Africa are incorrigibly indolent. Yet it\r\nis by the labours of these very people, controlled by Europeans, that\r\nthe prosperity of the Southern States of America has been established.\r\nIn my humble opinion the West African should be very good material\r\nfor civilisation. Compared with the East Indian, he is perhaps not so\r\npatient, laborious, or thrifty; but, on the other hand, he is much more\r\nvivacious and virile; he is not hampered by the restrictions of caste;\r\nhe is physically strong and healthy; he is capable of producing men who\r\nare intellectually not a whit inferior to the average European; and above\r\nall, instead of adhering obstinately to his own customs as the Indian\r\nso often does, he always shows a remarkable desire for the customs and\r\nculture of Europe. In fact, I personally feel, though I may be wrong,\r\nthat these people are better material for civilisation than East Indians,\r\nand I do not think that the backwardness of West Africa can be wholly or\r\neven largely assigned to defects in their character.\r\n\r\nTo many of us the real reason for this backwardness appears to be\r\nundoubtedly the so-called unhealthiness of the West African “climate” for\r\nEuropeans. It is impossible to deny the fact that the European cannot\r\nlive on the West African Coast in the same security against disease as he\r\nenjoys in the East and West Indies; and in my opinion it is this fact,\r\nand not the original barbarism of the natives, or their indolence, which\r\nretards progress here. The agent of civilisation dies on the threshold of\r\nthe country which he comes to develop.\r\n\r\nIt would require a large volume to deal adequately with this important\r\nsubject, and I can only attempt an outline here. We shall first ask what\r\nis the cause of this unhealthiness, and secondly, what is the remedy.\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt to give any statistics of mortality among Europeans\r\nor natives, because what statistics exist are not at all reliable.\r\nBut the fact that the country is extremely unhealthy for Europeans is\r\nuniversally accepted; and is, moreover, demonstrated by the high rates\r\nfor life-insurance, by the large amount of leave which Government grants\r\nto its employés, and by the difficulty which all employers experience in\r\nobtaining European agents for West African work, even for high pay. In\r\nfact, the country is so notorious in this respect that it is unnecessary\r\nto labour the point farther.\r\n\r\nWhat are the causes of the unhealthiness of West Africa for Europeans?\r\nThe first series of causes are undoubtedly a group of infectious\r\ndiseases, certainly or probably due to parasitic invasion of the body.\r\nThese are principally what is known as malarial or intermittent fever,\r\nwith its most dangerous variety, blackwater fever; various other fevers,\r\ndysentery, and according to many physicians, yellow fever. The first\r\nattacks the European with greater force than it attacks the habituated\r\nnative, but nevertheless produces great havoc among native children. It\r\nis so prevalent that new-comers frequently succumb within a few weeks\r\nafter arrival, while old residents often suffer from relapses during\r\nthe whole of their stay in the country. In addition, epidemics either\r\nof this fever, yellow fever, or some allied disease, sweep through the\r\nsettlements, causing great mortality among the Europeans; dysentery\r\nand bowel complaints are scarcely less to be feared in some parts. The\r\nrecords of West Africa are blackened by these terrible plagues, which\r\ntime after time have blotted out the names of the most daring travellers,\r\nthe most capable governors, and the most enterprising traders; which\r\nmutilate the lives of those whom they do not kill; and which hamper every\r\npolitical or commercial enterprise by striking down or intimidating the\r\nagents who are sent out to execute it.\r\n\r\nBut we must not imagine that these are the only factors of the total\r\nresult. The heat and moisture of the climate are most enervating to\r\nEuropeans. The general absence of good food—good meat, bread, vegetables,\r\nand milk—tends to produce dyspepsia and melancholy. The absence of most\r\nof the comforts and amenities to which Europeans are accustomed in their\r\nown home—good houses, good servants, society and exercise, not to mention\r\nthe absence of wives and children—depress the mind; and when this general\r\noutline is filled in by such details as the ever-present dread of serious\r\nsickness, the constant stings of insects, the unsavoury surroundings of\r\na squalid native population, it must be confessed that the colonist has\r\nmuch to depress him. What wonder if, in such circumstances, alcoholism\r\nand debauchery sometimes complete the sketch! The fact is, that what we\r\ncall the “unhealthiness” of West Africa is a complex due to many causes\r\nwhich assist each other. People are apt to fall into a vicious circle\r\nfrom which it is hard to escape. I may say, indeed, that the whole of\r\nWest Africa has fallen into this vicious circle and has not yet escaped\r\nfrom it. Let us consider the point farther.\r\n\r\nWhen we find much sickness in a given country we are too inclined to\r\nthink that the sickness is entirely due to certain natural conditions\r\nwhich are present in that country and which render it unhealthy. We\r\nforget that the sickness may be due, not to the country itself, but to\r\nthe fact that the inhabitants do not take proper precautions against the\r\ndiseases which persecute them. Now the whole trend of sanitary science\r\nhas been to show in a convincing manner that the great infectious\r\ndiseases are preventable, if only the proper precautions are taken.\r\nTime after time we have witnessed the entire disappearance, or at least\r\nthe partial disappearance, of such diseases from whole countries. For\r\nexample, small-pox and typhus have almost vanished from the great States\r\nof Europe—at least we may say so when we compare their prevalence in the\r\npast with their prevalence at the present day. Typhoid and diphtheria\r\nare diminishing daily. Malarial fever and dysentery, which were formerly\r\nscourges of parts of Britain, have almost entirely gone from the country.\r\nEven in the tropics we shall find numerous instances of the same kind.\r\nCalcutta was once a hot-bed of fever and cholera, and was probably as\r\nfatal to Europeans as West Africa is now said to be. Rangoon was deadly\r\nwhen the British first went there. A century ago cholera often swept away\r\nwhole regiments in India. We now look in vain for this state of things.\r\nAs a whole, India is perhaps as healthy for Europeans as England is—at\r\nleast if we exclude the enervating effects of mere heat; and, indeed, I\r\nthink that in some respects, in the absence of colds and chest complaints\r\nand in the benefits of open-air life and exercise, Europeans in India are\r\nmore fortunate than their brothers at home.\r\n\r\nSuch facts alone clearly demonstrate that many diseases are not dependent\r\nupon natural factors beyond human control; but science has reinforced\r\nthe argument by showing that a number of infectious diseases are due to\r\nmicroorganisms which spring from previously diseased persons and not\r\nfrom the air, soil, or water of localities. When, therefore, we speak\r\nof a given place being unhealthy, we merely mean that from some cause\r\nor other infectious disease is readily propagated from the sick to the\r\nhealthy in that place. This may in part be due to the local conditions\r\nas regards heat, moisture, and so on being especially favourable to the\r\ntransmission of the disease germs; but it may also be due to the fact\r\nthat no precautions are taken to check this transmission.\r\n\r\nThus in the case of West Africa we may ask, Is the local sickness really\r\ndue to the climate being specially favourable to the transmission of\r\ndisease; or is it due to the neglect of proper precautions? I would\r\nnot be prepared to say that as regards heat, moisture, and profuse\r\nvegetation—conditions long known to be particularly favourable to\r\nmalaria—West Africa differs much from Calcutta or Rangoon. So far as\r\nnature goes I can see little difference between West Africa and other\r\ntropical regions which I have visited. On the other hand, I see the\r\ngreatest difference in the mode of life adopted by Europeans in West\r\nAfrica and in India; and I am convinced that the excessive mortality\r\namongst them is due largely, if not principally, to this cause, added to\r\nthe imperfect condition of public sanitation in the country.\r\n\r\nMy own visits to West Africa have been short and limited. I have thrice\r\nlived in Freetown for brief periods, and have paid flying visits to\r\nBathurst, Accra, Lagos, and Ibadan. But though my experiences of the\r\ncountry were thus brief enough, I was always in a position to see a good\r\ndeal in the time at my disposal, and my powers of sanitary observation,\r\nso to speak, were previously exercised by eighteen years’ employment in\r\nthe Indian Medical Service. Moreover, for the last three years I have\r\nbeen in constant communication with many old residents on the Coast,\r\nand I have also learned much from the members of several expeditions\r\nsent there by the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, and by reading\r\nnumerous reports on the sanitation of the country. I state these facts\r\nsimply in order to enable the reader to judge of the value of my\r\ntestimony on the points under consideration. I do not pretend that a\r\ngreater experience would not have increased that value; but at the same\r\ntime it should be remarked that a sanitarian of any experience, like a\r\ntrained physician, can often make a correct diagnosis in a comparatively\r\nshort time; and that it is not necessary to examine every town in a\r\ncountry in order to arrive at a general conception of its sanitary\r\ncondition. Moreover, the towns which I have seen are the capitals of four\r\nout of the six British Colonies on the Coast.\r\n\r\nIn my experience, such as it is, the mode of life of Europeans in West\r\nAfrica is not suited to the tropics.\r\n\r\nTake the houses to begin with. They are not generally good. It is\r\nabsolutely essential in the tropics to have good roofs and large airy\r\nrooms. Our wise forefathers recognised this early in India, and built the\r\ngreat solid structures which are such a prominent feature of Calcutta\r\nand Madras and many Indian stations. I have seen nothing of the kind in\r\nWest Africa. Even in Lagos and Accra the houses can be described only as\r\nsecond-rate. In Freetown they are simply execrable; and it is monstrous\r\nthat Englishmen, much more ladies, should be compelled to live in them.\r\nIt should be remembered that many of these West African hovels are built\r\nby Government. In Ibadan I saw a magnificent iron house which I was told\r\ncost the Government £6000, but which is so ill-designed and ill-placed\r\nthat in the heat of the day the inmates are compelled to go outside and\r\nsit under leaf shelters! Then again, in India the Europeans and some of\r\nthe better class natives live in a separate quarter; but in West Africa\r\nthis seems to be the case only to a limited extent; while in Freetown\r\nthe Europeans often live over native shops. Remembering that infectious\r\ndiseases are communicated from the sick, we shall easily understand\r\nwhy the absence of a separate quarter is so dangerous to health. Those\r\nabsolute essentials to comfort in the tropics, punkahs and mosquito-nets,\r\nwhich are invariably used in India, are often the exception in West\r\nAfrica, or were so until quite recently.\r\n\r\nAs regards food, we find little efforts made to help the African\r\ncolonists to obtain good provisions. Fresh milk and butter often cannot\r\nbe got at all, even where cattle exist in plenty. Government sometimes\r\nmaintains, at considerable cost, botanical gardens for various economical\r\npurposes. I was told that these gardens used to grow vegetables for the\r\nEuropeans until stopped by a mandate from England, on the ground that a\r\nGovernment botanist is not a vegetable gardener!—a type of the hopelessly\r\nunpractical spirit which has crept into all British administration. As a\r\nresult the colonist has to fall back upon native vegetables, to which he\r\nis not accustomed. The meat is generally poor and coarse, and no proper\r\neffort is made to improve it. Ice—another essential in the tropics—cannot\r\ngenerally be obtained. I was gravely informed that ice-machines will not\r\nwork in West Africa. It is difficult to see why this is the case, because\r\nthey will certainly work in the hottest and dampest parts of India.\r\nAerated waters have to be imported and cost about sixpence a bottle; I\r\nsuppose that they, too, “cannot be made” in West Africa. In India they\r\nare made everywhere and cost about a penny a bottle. Singular effect of\r\nthe West African climate!\r\n\r\nWhat are more necessary anywhere than exercise, recreation, and society?\r\nIn India the smallest station has its gymkana; its polo, tennis, cricket,\r\nand even football; its dinners, its afternoon parties, its balls;\r\nits shooting and riding. As for West Africa, though, owing to the\r\nintelligent encouragement of the Governors, much attention is now being\r\ngiven to this subject, things are very different. A resident of Sekondi\r\ntold me that their “only amusement is to drink.” So it seemed. In many\r\nplaces horses do not exist, because it is said they do not live there. So\r\nfar as I know, Government has never attempted the slightest scientific\r\ninquiry into this most important matter, although probably the disability\r\nis due merely to some easily preventable parasitic disease. In Freetown\r\nmany people take no exercise at all and are carried about even for short\r\ndistances in hammocks. In up-country places, I hear, the dulness of life,\r\nowing to the absence of recreation and exercise, is often intolerable and\r\nheart-breaking.\r\n\r\nTurning now to affairs of state sanitation, let us first ask, what\r\nwould have been the logical and business-like course for adoption by\r\nGovernment from the earliest days of these Colonies? Seeing the obvious\r\nfact that all development of the country was being retarded by the\r\nsickness and mortality among the European Officials and traders, a\r\npractical Government would from the first have strained every nerve\r\nto remedy this state of things. It would have spent every available\r\npenny in the sanitation of the coast towns, which are, in fact, the\r\nportals of the continent. It would have kept these scrupulously clean,\r\nswept and drained. It would have housed its employés thoroughly well\r\nin quarters removed from the infectious vicinity of the poorer native\r\nlocations. It would have encouraged the traders to do the same for their\r\nagents. It would have organised farms for the purpose of producing good\r\nfresh food—meat, milk, butter and vegetables. It would have created\r\nor endowed places of exercise and recreation. It would have attempted\r\nto add in every possible way to the comfort of the Europeans, who are\r\nthe backbone of the Colonies, knowing that reasonable comfort is half\r\nthe way to health and happiness, and that senseless and unnecessary\r\ndiscomfort is more than half the way in the other direction. It would\r\nhave taken scrupulous care of the water supply; of the conservancy; of\r\nthe drainage of swamps. It would have insisted on the adequate sanitation\r\nof native locations near European locations, in the interests both of\r\nnatives and Europeans. It would have maintained an up-to-date medical and\r\nsanitary department, provided with sufficient powers and funds for its\r\nwork. It would have kept accurate statistics of sickness and mortality,\r\nespecially among the Europeans. It would have ordered numerous scientific\r\ninvestigations into the causes of the most disastrous West African\r\ndiseases, both among men and domestic animals. Above all, it would have\r\nput the direction of sanitary affairs into the hands of the ablest\r\nscientific men it could procure.\r\n\r\nNow I do not wish to take the _rôle_ of the fault finder; but I must\r\nsay, so far as I know—and I hope I may be mistaken—the Colonial Office\r\nand the West African Governments and municipalities can scarcely be\r\nsaid to have given adequate attention to a single one of the items in\r\nthis programme—at least until quite recently. Consider the question of\r\nsurface drainage for instance. It has been well known, since the time of\r\nthe Romans, that surface-drainage removes malaria; and malaria is the\r\nprincipal enemy of the West African Colonies. Surely, then, the most\r\nobvious considerations should have induced Government to reclaim the\r\nlarge marshes existing in the vicinity of the principal settlements. A\r\nsmall annual expenditure, if persisted in, would have gradually done the\r\nwork; and, as Sir William MacGregor once observed, the local Governments\r\nhave had at their disposal for years large gangs of gaol prisoners who\r\ncould, with advantage, have been employed on such useful labours instead\r\nof shot-drill. But no; the marshes have been allowed to exist as they\r\nwere. It is only quite recently that the swamps of Lagos and Bathurst\r\nhave been touched. In Freetown the swamps existed in almost every street\r\nin the native quarters during the rains, and were, in fact, actually\r\nmade by incompetent engineering efforts and maintained by the grossest\r\nsanitary neglect—the roadside drains being generally nothing but series\r\nof deep pools full of stagnant water seething with insect life. Yet\r\nthis town was called the white-man’s grave; and Heaven was blamed for\r\ncausing a disease which man could easily have prevented if the most\r\nelementary teaching of sanitary science had been attended to. Even after\r\nthe connection between stagnant water and malaria was fully verified\r\nand explained by the discovery (completed in 1899) that the disease is\r\ncarried from the sick to the healthy by certain kinds of mosquitoes which\r\nbreed in stagnant puddles, no spontaneous effort was made by Government\r\nto improve the surface-drainage in Freetown.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 the Liverpool School took the trouble to send out an expedition\r\nwhich made a complete map of the mosquito-breeding puddles in the\r\ntown; and next year the Commission of the Royal Society extended our\r\nobservations. Two years later, however, another expedition of the\r\nLiverpool School found that everything had been left in exactly the\r\nsame old state, except that the salary of the chief sanitary official\r\nhad been largely increased. Not a puddle, not a ditch had been drained;\r\nnot a single effort worth mention had been made, to act upon the new\r\ndiscovery which was of such importance to these Colonies; and it was not\r\nuntil the advent of the new Governor, Sir Charles King-Harman, assisted\r\nby the Liverpool School, that any adequate attempt was made to clear and\r\ndrain Freetown. In the other Colonies progress was equally slow, until\r\nSir William MacGregor and Dr. Strachan commenced their anti-malarial\r\ncampaign in Lagos. The central authority, the Colonial Office, instead of\r\nforcing on measures in a brisk, business-like way, contented itself with\r\npublishing good advice which every one had heard a dozen times before.\r\nThe Governments of the Gold Coast (Sir Matthew Nathan), of the Gambia\r\n(Sir George Denton), are now pushing on in this direction; and we can\r\nonly hope that the progress will be maintained in the future in all the\r\nColonies.\r\n\r\nThe other items of the programme mentioned above have also received\r\nlittle attention. The medical and sanitary services have not been kept in\r\nan up-to-date condition.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in 1880, Laveran discovered the parasite which causes\r\nmalarial fever; but even twenty years later there were few doctors who\r\nused the discovery for the proper diagnosis and treatment of the fevers\r\nprevalent on the Coast. In most cases they were not even provided with\r\nmicroscopes for the work. In these respects the West African medical\r\nservices were only on a par with the other State medical services; which,\r\nwhile they often contain exceedingly smart men, are generally wanting as\r\na whole in scientific ability and push, and in the influence which they\r\nshould exercise in the government of the countries to which they belong.\r\nA high official once informed me that of all the men under his orders\r\nthe doctors had the least sense of duty. This is little to be wondered\r\nat, since, in my experience, efficiency does not lead to advancement in\r\nthese services, and the most perfunctory men reach promotion as readily\r\nas the most meritorious. I have noticed a dozen instances of the almost\r\ncomplete indifference to science shown in these public medical services.\r\nFor example, when the first Liverpool expedition reached Sierra Leone\r\nin 1899, the principal medical officer of the R.A.M.C. forbade us to\r\nfeed mosquitoes upon his cases of malarial fever for experiment, though\r\nneither he nor his subordinates took the smallest trouble to prevent\r\ntheir men from being bitten night and day by the insects in the barracks\r\nand hospitals. We were convinced that this order was given simply out of\r\nwilful desire to obstruct us. Similarly in India a military doctor once\r\nforbade me even to prick the fingers of his patients in order to study\r\ntheir blood. The manner in which the R.A.M.C. authorities interrupted\r\nthe researches of Colonel Bruce, F.R.S., on tsetse-fly disease and\r\nhorse sickness in South Africa, and in which the Madras Government\r\npersecuted Dr. King for his small-pox work, is well known. It would be\r\nfolly to expect that services administered in this manner could ever\r\ntake a leading part in organising great campaigns against disease in the\r\ncolonies; and I fear that, until Sir William MacGregor led the way in\r\nLagos, the West African medical services, even though they have possessed\r\nmany able men, have done little to improve sanitation in that country.\r\nThe fault is entirely with the chief offices of Government, which too\r\noften appoint and retain as heads of their medical departments men who\r\nhave no scientific status or even scientific knowledge, and at the\r\nsame time take no trouble to promote the deserving. I have known many\r\ninstances of this. It would be much better, in my opinion, to fill such\r\noffices from the ranks of able civil practitioners or scientists at home,\r\nrather than to select men who have no other claim to the post than long\r\nofficial service.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest defects in the sanitary administration of West Africa\r\nhas lain in the constant refusal of Government to investigate the causes\r\nof sickness by making use of the services of experts. Government argues\r\nthat it is not its duty to investigate disease; but is it not? It admits\r\nthe duty of maintaining expensive medical services, but not that of\r\nhelping those services to increase their knowledge of their business!\r\nA logical position truly! In my own humble opinion the Colonial Office\r\nought to have spent at least £5000 per annum during the last fifty years\r\nfor investigation of the causes of sickness in West Africa alone. Do\r\nnot talk to me of want of funds. There are plenty of funds, but they\r\nare thrown away on military expeditions; on the salaries of useless\r\nlegal officials—chief justices and attorney-generals of little villages;\r\nand on building houses such as the one I referred to at Ibadan, which\r\ncost £6000, enough to pay for sanitary researches for years, and is\r\nuninhabitable! It is a case illustrating that peculiar form of mind which\r\nlooks upon all research and investigation as idling and waste of time\r\nand money, a frame of mind which seems to be specially a British one. We\r\nhave yet to learn the obvious fact that, if we wish to get a thing done,\r\nwe must first make suitable inquiry as to how it should be done. Disease\r\ncannot be removed from a continent merely by establishing a medical\r\nservice; we must also help the service to perfect its knowledge. The hand\r\nis not the same thing as the brain. In West Africa we have long possessed\r\nthe hand, but the brain has been wanting.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the defects of the West African sanitation are really\r\ndue to the fact that the colonial councils are almost entirely in the\r\nhands of certain castes which are not scientific castes, and which\r\ncare little for sanitary matters. I mean the politicians, soldiers,\r\ntax-collectors and legal people. To these it is a matter of little\r\nmoment to cleanse streets, to purify towns, to banish disease from\r\nthousands of homes. It is not given to them to stand powerless by the\r\nside of death-beds and to hear the cries of the bereaved at the moment\r\nof bereavement. If they have money to spend, do they spend it for the\r\npurposes for which it was really chiefly taken from the tax-payer—for\r\nconservancy and hygiene? The filthy condition of most native towns in the\r\nBritish tropical possessions gives the answer. No, it is a finer thing\r\nto build a grand new post-office or law-court, or to conduct a forward\r\nmilitary policy which will find its place in the home papers and delight\r\nthe heart of the British greengrocer (and voter) at his breakfast table.\r\nWell, after all, it is human nature—each man for his own caste. As for\r\nme, I have been too long an official myself not to understand these\r\nlittle matters.\r\n\r\nI have said that West Africa has fallen into a vicious circle, and the\r\nnature of this vicious circle will now be apparent. The unhealthiness\r\nof the Coast for Europeans tends to check their activities in all\r\ndirections; and in return this detrimental effect on their activities\r\ntends to check their efforts towards ameliorating sanitary affairs. The\r\ntwo conditions work hand in hand. It is impossible to remain blind to the\r\ndisastrous economical effect of the unhealthiness. It leads to a constant\r\nchange in the working staff of the country, not only in consequence of\r\ndeath and sickness, but also in consequence of the frequent furlough\r\nwhich is rendered necessary. From the highest to the lowest, few\r\nEuropeans remain in West Africa for more than two or three years at a\r\nstretch; and many Government officials are entitled to leave after one\r\nyear. This has the effect of rendering all business discontinuous. As\r\nsoon as a man has started a piece of work he is called away from his\r\nefforts, and is obliged to leave everything to a successor. In India\r\nthe period of residence in the country before furlough can be demanded\r\nis five years at least, and even then the break in the business which\r\noccurs during the furlough is often very mischievous. How much more so\r\nmust be the interruption which occurs in West Africa every year or two!\r\nThe same thing prevents people in West Africa from taking sufficient\r\ninterest in the homes of their exile. Many of them have told me that all\r\nthe time they are in the country they are indifferent to what happens,\r\nthat they simply live from hand to mouth, careless of their surroundings\r\nand longing only for the day when, if fate spares them, they can escape\r\nonce more for a brief interval to Europe. It is this feeling which\r\nmakes them indifferent to the houses in which they live, to the food\r\nthey eat, to their surroundings—and sometimes, I fear, to their duties.\r\nThe danger, discomfort and _ennui_ of life are so great that a chronic\r\ncondition of callousness inimical to all serious effort is frequently\r\narrived at. We must remember these facts when we are inclined to blame\r\nthem. What wonder then that a matter like sanitation, which requires\r\nsuch constant endeavours, is apt to be neglected. Thus the circle comes\r\n“full round” again; and the neglect of sanitation leads to the paralysing\r\nunhealthiness which leads to the neglect of sanitation. I have observed\r\nthe same thing elsewhere—notably in the unhealthy planting districts of\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nWhat must we do to mend this state of affairs? Well, the vicious circle\r\nmust be broken at all costs.\r\n\r\nBut how? I think that there is really only one way in which it can be\r\ndone, and that is by the introduction of a new force into the vortex. I\r\nmean public opinion and public effort at home in Europe. These must be\r\nroused for the sake of our countrymen in West Africa. This country should\r\nbe made to understand that it has something more to do than to watch\r\nprocessions of colonial troops and to brag of its Empire. It is its duty\r\nto see that the Empire which it boasts of is properly administered, and\r\nthat our countrymen who are sent to carry on the affairs, both official\r\nand commercial, of that Empire are not left to die there unnecessarily.\r\nThis duty has certainly been most grossly neglected in the past. It\r\nshould be the work of all of us, especially of those who govern the\r\ncountry, of the wealthy merchants who trade with it, of the rich people\r\nwho do not know what to do with their money, and of men like myself, who\r\nare hired to study and teach tropical sanitation—it should be the work of\r\nall of us to see that it is not neglected in the future.\r\n\r\nAs every one knows, this new force has already come into being. Every day\r\nsees some notice of West African affairs in the Press. The able Governors\r\nof the Colonies are, I think, doing all for the cause which their limited\r\nmeans allow. The merchants of Liverpool and London have come forward most\r\nhandsomely with their tropical schools, which I make bold to say are\r\ndoing well also. A single philanthropist has actually drained and cleaned\r\nthe houses in Freetown _pro tempore_, at his own expense, and last, but\r\nby no means least, many young pathologists have given their time and\r\nrisked their health for the cause.\r\n\r\nBut what are the exact steps which should be taken? I have already\r\nindicated these above. It is the duty of the Government to see that\r\nthe principal settlements are kept scrupulously clean and drained; to\r\nconstruct and publish proper statistics of sickness and mortality among\r\nthe Europeans; to appoint whole-time health officers; to enforce sanitary\r\nlaws; and to encourage the building of good houses and the establishment\r\nof dairies, settlement farms, gymkanas and other institutions or trades\r\nwhich are likely to conduce to the comfort and health of the colonists.\r\nThus Government has a great deal to do. It has only begun as yet.\r\n\r\nBut it is not Government alone which must act. Sir William MacGregor\r\nrecently pointed out to the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce that men who\r\ncarry on business on the Coast have much to do for their employés—to\r\ngive them good houses, to force them to take proper precautions against\r\nmalaria, and to add to their comfort in every possible way.\r\n\r\nThen there is the philanthropist millionaire. I wish that we could\r\nget hold of him in earnest. Sir Charles King-Harman once told me that\r\n£100,000 would reform the West Coast if presented as a free gift, by\r\nenabling Government to start gymkanas, dairies, and such like for the\r\nEuropeans. So it would; and the money ought to be obtained.\r\n\r\nLastly, the Colonial Office ought to do one thing—a thing which was\r\nrecommended by a deputation which waited upon the Colonial Secretary some\r\ntime ago. That is, it ought to appoint a Sanitary Commissioner on the\r\nIndian model, to make constant inspections of sanitary matters in the\r\nWest African Colonies, and to report directly to the Colonial Office.\r\nWe were told, however, that the scheme was too costly, and otherwise\r\nimpossible. But shortly afterwards a gentleman with a large salary was\r\nappointed in order to inspect the knapsacks, &c., of the black troops—a\r\nmuch more important matter than any sanitary business!\r\n\r\nI may mention here an opinion which I frequently heard expressed on the\r\nCoast, namely, that the West African Colonies have now outgrown the\r\npresent system of control by small detached Governments placed under\r\nan office in London. It is contended that the whole country should be\r\nadministered by a Governor-General on the Indian lines. I fancy that\r\nsanitation would not lose by the change.\r\n\r\nSuch are my humble opinions on sanitary matters in West Africa. They are\r\ngiven in response to an invitation from the author of this book; and, of\r\ncourse, exigencies of space have prevented my dealing with many points\r\nwhich should be dealt with in a complete survey of the subject—which\r\nwould require a book for itself. I have thought it best to say exactly\r\nwhat I think without much reservation; but, of course, my views may,\r\nperhaps, not be so sound as I imagine. It would be the grandest thing in\r\nthe world if sanitary science could give to civilisation such a glorious\r\ngift as West Africa; and I believe that it will. But the thing will be\r\ndone only by straight speaking, hard hitting, and the most indomitable\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nLAND TENURE AND LABOUR IN WEST AFRICA\r\n\r\n    “In dealing with the natives, one must never touch their rights\r\n    in land.”—SIR WILLIAM MACGREGOR.\r\n\r\n    “The so-called labour problem is, in my opinion, created by\r\n    the people who complain of it, and not by the natives, who are\r\n    perfectly willing to work when fairly treated.”—Mr. J. A. DAW,\r\n    of the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation.[145]\r\n\r\n    “I know the Gold Coast natives well, and I repeat, you can\r\n    get all you want out of them, if people will only realise\r\n    that the native is a human being, and not an animal or a\r\n    machine.”—Captain DONOVAN, late of the Gold Coast Police.[146]\r\n\r\n    “Nothing in all the history submitted on this subject is more\r\n    misleading, untrue, and unjust than the reiterated statement\r\n    that the chiefs and people of Western Africa are unfitted for\r\n    peaceable self-government. It is not pretended they will reach\r\n    for the present any Western European ideal, but they will not\r\n    lag behind some people who claim to be better. The people do\r\n    not want war; the very facility with which their disputes are\r\n    temporarily adjusted serves to show this disposition. The Coast\r\n    is far from having recovered from the dire effects of the slave\r\n    trade. The chiefs are weak, and much of their power is taken\r\n    from them by the very British Administration which scolds them\r\n    for their non-success.”—C. S. SALMON, “The Crown Colonies of\r\n    Great Britain.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is one thing more than another upon which the most competent\r\nstudents of West Africa are agreed, it is the tenaciousness of the West\r\nAfrican Negro to his landed rights. Land tenure in West Africa has been\r\nproperly described as a “cult.” The most experienced English, French and\r\nGerman observers have noted this characteristic. Wherever it has been\r\nadequately studied, the system of native land tenure, in its tribal,\r\nfamily, individual and commercial aspects, is found to be at once simple\r\nin its broad lines, elaborate in its details, and approaching in many\r\nrespects to the most advanced democratic conceptions of Western Europe.\r\nBefore the torchlight of scientific inquiry, the old idea of the Negro\r\nbeing more or less of an animal, incapable of evolving any rational\r\nor consistent policy; too backward to frame anything approaching an\r\nunwritten code of law; his every act of life being merely the outcome\r\nof natural instinct, can no longer be entertained. And to the knowledge\r\nthat these beings, who were thought irrational, and inconsequent to the\r\nextent of being the half-devil, half-child of popular imagination, has\r\nbeen added the conviction that the commercial and political success of\r\nthe Powers of Europe in their West African Possessions depends for its\r\nattainment upon the recognition of native law in respect to property.\r\n\r\nBut although the testimony to this effect is shared by those who have the\r\nlargest experience of West Africa, and although evidence is accumulating\r\non all sides which corroborates in the most ample manner the statements\r\nof Ellis, Sarbah and Mary Kingsley,[147] it is nevertheless unhappily\r\ntrue that the tendency on the part of the European Powers, not only to\r\ninterfere with the native law of land tenure, but to frame legislation\r\nwithout regard whatever for its importance in the relationship between\r\nthe European and the Negro, is increasingly manifest. It would seem as\r\nthough, having discovered that the West African Negro is not a brute\r\nbut a man, evidence which establishes the discovery is deliberately set\r\naside; because it is so much easier to go on treating the native as a\r\nbrute, that is to say, as a being deprived of the faculty of reasoning,\r\nand who, on the principle of “a woman, a dog and a walnut-tree, the more\r\nyou beat ’em the better they’ll be,” will come fawning to our feet in\r\nabject humility upon every fresh exhibition of our superiority.\r\n\r\nIt is very curious to observe this conflict of forces; painstaking\r\nresearch, its published results, and the influence it wields, _versus_\r\nimpatience and disinclination to investigate on the one hand; and selfish\r\nmaterial interests on the other. The future of European political and\r\ncommercial enterprise in West Africa is largely bound up with the\r\nstruggle for the capture of Public Opinion which is going on in this\r\ncountry and on the Continent. At present, the purely materialistic\r\nnotion, assisted by its twin-brother Indifference, is in the ascendant.\r\nApparent success having been secured in that part of tropical Western\r\nAfrica where, under the tuition of his white masters, the native has\r\nbecome a mere machine for the production of dividends to European company\r\npromoters, a great impetus has been given to the conception, popular\r\nin so many quarters, that the _raison d’être_ of West Africa and the\r\nWest African is their exploitation by Western Europe, on such lines and\r\nin such fashion as the peoples of Western Europe see fit. The European\r\nGovernments are alternately allowing themselves to be dragged along this\r\nperilous path whose ultimate destination is the abyss called Failure, or\r\nare hanging back from it, beset with doubts. But the danger is acutely\r\nrealised by many, and as it gathers in extent and consistency, is being\r\nenergetically opposed. The merchants, English, French and German, are,\r\nas a body, unanimous in condemnation. The exceptions to the rule are\r\nexceedingly few and far between. The best type of Colonial Administrator\r\nin West Africa also is utterly antagonistic, and amongst the still\r\nrestricted but daily growing section of the Public which follows the\r\naffairs of West Africa with intelligent interest a strong feeling of\r\nprotest gathers volume every day. These forces are numerically inferior,\r\nbut they carry great weight, and if they can succeed in combining they\r\nmust ultimately win the day. But the struggle will be long and bitter.\r\n\r\nAn attempt has been made in this volume to show (1) the unwisdom of\r\ninterfering too rapidly, and without sufficient care and thought, with\r\nnative customs generally, and (2), as regards the evil of slave-raiding,\r\nthe advisability of seriously considering whether force is the only\r\nweapon which a great Empire can forge to suppress it. In the latter\r\ncase, the Powers are able to put forward a plea justifying interference,\r\ninsomuch as the evil is an active one. The only difference of opinion,\r\nas already stated, is the form which such interference should take. In\r\nthe former case the evils, if some of them are evils—a matter which\r\nadmits of a good deal of qualification—are of a kind that patience,\r\ntact, and time—time above all things—will prove the most efficient\r\nmeans of combating. But in respect to native law of land tenure, we are\r\nnot confronted with any evil. On the contrary, the system of native\r\nland tenure is essentially just, thoroughly adapted to the needs of\r\nthe country and its people, a striking refutation of the “arrested\r\ndevelopment” theory as applied to the Negro, and _per se_ an eloquent\r\nvindication of the Negro’s claim to consideration at the hands of\r\nthe European invaders of, and settlers in, his country. There can be\r\nno justification whatever for the break-up of land tenure, or for\r\nthe alienation of native property, under any pretext. It is morally\r\nindefensible, and what is morally indefensible is seldom politically wise.\r\n\r\nIn West Africa, the circumstances being what they are, interference with\r\nnative property is bound to affect, not in theory but in practice, the\r\ninterest of every single individual in the country. In the coastwise\r\nregions of West Africa proper, as far south, that is to say, as the\r\nRio del Rey, where Bantu culture begins, it may be accepted as a rule\r\n(whatever differentiation may exist in the system of land tenure in\r\nwidely removed districts), from which the departures are extremely\r\nrare,[148] that every square yard of the country is _owned_. Sarbah for\r\nthe Gold Coast; Clozel and Delafosse for the Ivory Coast; Ellis for\r\nYoruba; Mary Kingsley for the Rivers; Bohn for French Guinea; Fabre for\r\nDahomey, have borne witness in their respective fields of observation to\r\nthis fact—that there is no land without an owner. There is also a vast\r\namount of untabulated corroborative information from almost every part\r\nof the Coast. South of Rio del Rey the land customs of the natives have\r\nnot been the object of so much inquiry as north of it, and there the\r\npopulation is not in the main so dense, but what gleanings are available\r\nto us appear to be conclusive on the same point: in all inhabited\r\ndistricts land is never without an owner, whose claims, whether tribal or\r\nfamily, are as sacred in native unwritten law as they would be if duly\r\nset forth in a legal document, in accordance with the full requirements\r\nof European jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand why this should be so. The native lives on\r\nthe produce of his land. He not only lives upon it, it is also his\r\nwealth, his currency, his medium of exchange for European goods. The\r\nproducts which he gathers in his forests, the plantations he makes in\r\nthe clearings and the plains, these are at once his sustenance and his\r\ncash. Is it astonishing, therefore, that he guards his land and all that\r\ngrows therein, or is built thereon, with passionate jealousy; and that,\r\nwhereas he can be induced without difficulty to lease his property rights\r\nunder certain conditions to Europeans for even a long term of years, he\r\ncan seldom be brought, save by physical compulsion, to alienate them for\r\never? Ought it to be matter for surprise that legislation calculated to\r\nhinder his free use of the products of his land, or action of which the\r\nlogical consequence is to reduce him from the position of land-owner to\r\ntenant, either provokes him to pit his spears and flintlocks against the\r\nrepeating-rifles of the despoilers, or breeds in him such utter confusion\r\nof mind, such bewilderment and terror, that,\r\n\r\n    Fleeing to the forest’s dim recess,\r\n    He broods in sullen unproductiveness,\r\n    Plunged in deeper savagery,\r\n    Witness to the high morality\r\n    Of Christian peoples?\r\n\r\nStrange, indeed, does it seem, with the burden of historical proof to\r\nthe adaptability of the Negro; with the abundant and cumulative evidence\r\nof his willingness to trade, to learn, to take on new industries, to\r\neverywhere follow up his natural profession of agriculture; with the\r\nactual and daily evidence of his enterprise and producing capacity in the\r\nexisting oil-palm, ground-nut, mahogany and rubber industries; strange,\r\nindeed, that European statesmen worthy of the name should for a moment\r\nentertain the idea, or lend ear to the suggestion, that in a country\r\nlike West Africa, where the white element compared with the black is as\r\na grain of sand on the sea-shore, and where the European can attain\r\nnothing that is permanent or lasting without the willing co-operation\r\nof the Negro, the spontaneous production of the Negro as a free man,\r\nin the enjoyment of the fruits of his own land, can be replaced by the\r\nforced production of a serf deprived of his lands, his freedom, and his\r\nindividuality!\r\n\r\nIf in one sense the question of native land tenure in West Africa is\r\ndistinct from that of native labour, it is in another way closely allied\r\nto it, and to treat of one without referring to the other is difficult,\r\nif not impossible. But it is equally difficult, when once the labour\r\nproblem is raised, to confine oneself to West Africa only; for the theory\r\nof “assimilation” is very much to the fore just now, and although the\r\nconditions prevailing in West Africa differentiate absolutely from those\r\nin Central, East, and South Africa, the same general arguments are made\r\nto apply more or less to all four. I must, therefore, crave the reader’s\r\nindulgence if I wander somewhat afield.\r\n\r\nThere is not the least shadow of doubt that the tendency to go past the\r\nlaw of native land tenure in West Africa owes its origin in large measure\r\nto the oft-repeated statement that the Negro will not work. Numbers of\r\npeople have for some time past been assuring the Public that West Africa\r\ncan only be developed by compelling the native to work.[149] It is, of\r\ncourse, assumed _à priori_ that the native of West Africa does not work.\r\nHow the contention can be justified in the face of demonstrable and\r\neasily accessible facts to the contrary, we need not pause to inquire.\r\nIt suffices that the contention exists, and that there is not a paper\r\ndealing with African affairs in Great Britain, or the Continent of\r\nEurope, which does not contain in almost every issue some reference to\r\nthe matter. Nor is discussion limited to such papers. In the speeches of\r\npublic men whose interests are associated with Africa; in conferences, in\r\nbooks, pamphlets, and not infrequently in the daily press, the subject\r\ncrops up again and again. The refrain is usually much after this style:\r\n“The native will not work. We have to work and pay income-tax. Why should\r\nnot the native? What is the use of Africa to us if the native refuses to\r\nwork? It is intolerable. He must be made to work.”\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that the spirit of the hour is admirably suited to\r\nact the part of receiver to these laments. The signatory powers of the\r\nBerlin Act have allowed the gradual establishment and consolidation in\r\nWestern Central Africa of an institution the existence of which is based\r\nupon repudiation of the inherent right of the native to his land or the\r\nfruits thereof; and upon forced labour on the part of the dispossessed\r\nfor their despoilers. What wonder that the public of France and Germany,\r\nobserving the enormous profits derived by people immediately connected\r\nwith this institution, and led astray by the apathy of their statesmen\r\nto the evil, should put down to political ability what is merely\r\noutrage; and impatient at the comparatively slow progress of their own\r\npossessions, should begin to loudly call for the adoption of a similar\r\nsystem therein? “The King of Belgium has succeeded in making the natives\r\nwork. He and his coadjutors are reaping a huge harvest. Belgian industry\r\nis the gainer. Antwerp has become the first rubber market in the world.\r\nWhy not imitate the King of Belgium?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE IDLE NATIVE! MARKET SCENE IN WEST AFRICA]\r\n\r\nIt would be grossly unfair to describe this mental attitude on the part\r\nof public opinion in France and Germany as having been due, or as being\r\ndue, to a natural callousness. At one time, indeed, the proceedings\r\nof the Congo State were severely condemned in both countries, and not\r\nfarther back than 1895 Count Alvensleben, German Ambassador in Brussels,\r\nwas carrying on a correspondence with the then principal Secretary\r\nof the Congo State anent the payment of rubber premiums by the Congo\r\nState to its agents and the trading operations of that State, couched\r\nin such language as would have brought about between two European\r\nPowers an immediate rupture of diplomatic relations. But wealth commands\r\ngreat power, and its rapid acquisition is a blunter of conscience.\r\nThe Belgian financiers who control the two great Trusts in the Congo\r\nState—the _annexes_ of the Domaine Privé Trust and the Thys Trust—were\r\ndesirous for their own ends of still further extending their power.\r\nThey managed to obtain the co-operation of many highly placed persons\r\nin France and Germany, and to secure the assistance of an important\r\nsection of the Colonial Press in the two countries. The result is seen\r\nin the creation of what is known as the Concessionnaire _régime_ in the\r\nColony of French Congo; its partial adoption in the French Colony of\r\nDahomey; its attempted establishment in the auriferous French Colony\r\nof the Ivory Coast; and its introduction into German Cameroons, where,\r\nhowever, experience has led to a revulsion of feeling as healthy as it\r\nis encouraging. In other words, the indifference of the Powers to the\r\nviolation of the Berlin Act by the Sovereign of the Congo State has\r\ninvolved the application of the new slavery to another vast tract of\r\nterritory in Africa. Public opinion has been worked to such good purpose\r\nthat the lucubrations of a Carl Peters or Camille Janssens are not only\r\nlistened to with patience, but are regarded by many as the embodiment\r\nof a rational colonial policy; while in France, open appeals have for\r\nthe past year and more been uttered every day in favour of a _régime_\r\nof forced labour at the point of the bayonet. The theory that the Negro\r\nwill not work and must be compelled to do so has, therefore, made strides\r\nrapid enough among the Western nations on the Continent of Europe to\r\nsatisfy the fondest hopes of its promoters.\r\n\r\nIn England the modern school of thought in African affairs shows a like\r\ntendency. We hear in various forms how essential it is to inculcate\r\nthe African with the notion of the “dignity of labour.” As we are here\r\ndealing with West Africa, it would be out of place to discuss at any\r\nlength the labour questions connected with South Africa. But it is only\r\ntoo obvious that the financiers of the Rand and their friends at home\r\nare the leading spirits through whom British public opinion is being\r\ninfluenced towards coercion in the matter of native labour in Africa\r\nas a whole, just as the Brussels and Antwerp financiers who run the\r\nCongo State are the instruments whereby similar notions are propagated\r\non the Continent of Europe. As already stated, special conditions, as\r\nwell as the nature of the native population and, indeed, nearly all\r\nattendant circumstances, differ profoundly in West Africa and South\r\nAfrica, but it is necessary to indicate the prevalence of a common\r\nshade of thought which it is sought to apply in practice wherever the\r\nEuropean has secured a sufficiently strong hold upon the Dark Continent.\r\nIn a fascinating volume of African travel recently published by a\r\nbrilliant young explorer, Mr. H. S. Grogan, can be found embodied, in\r\na style distinguished for its honest vulgarity, frank brutality and\r\nentire absence of those hypocritical sophistries so much in vogue, the\r\nviews of the “modern school” as to what is, or what ought to be, the\r\ninter-relationship of European and Hamite in Africa.\r\n\r\nHere are a few samples of his arguments:\r\n\r\n    “But few people at home,” he writes, “realise what an alarming\r\n    and ever-growing difficulty has to be faced in the African\r\n    native problem. It is a difficulty that is unique in the\r\n    progress of the world.... Under the beneficent rule of the\r\n    white man he thrives like weeds in a hot-house.... What is to\r\n    be done with this ever-increasing mass of inertia? We have\r\n    undertaken his education and advancement, as we have carefully\r\n    explained, by the mawkish euphemisms in which we wrap our\r\n    land-grabbing schemes. When we undertake the education of a\r\n    child or beast we make them work, realising that work is the\r\n    sole road to advancement. But when we undertake the education\r\n    of a nigger, who, as I have endeavoured to show, is a blend\r\n    of the two, we say; ‘Dear Nigger, thou elect of Exeter Hall,\r\n    chosen of the negrophil, bread-and-butter of the missionary,\r\n    darling of the unthinking philanthropist, wilt thou deign to\r\n    put thy hand to the plough, or dost prefer to smoke and tipple\r\n    in undisturbed content? We, the white men whom thy conscience\r\n    wrongly judges to be thy superiors, will arrange the affairs\r\n    of state. Sleep on, thou ebony idol of a jaded civilisation,\r\n    may be anon thou wilt sing ‘Onward, Christian Soldiers.’ ... A\r\n    good sound system,” proceeds Mr. Grogan, “of compulsory labour\r\n    would do more to raise the nigger in five years than all the\r\n    millions which have been sunk in missionary efforts for the\r\n    last fifty.... Why should not other peoples be called upon to\r\n    work for the cause of progress? Throughout Africa the cry is,\r\n    ‘Give me labour.’ There is a sound maxim in the progress of\r\n    the world: ‘What cannot be utilised must be eliminated.’ And\r\n    drivel as we will for a while, the time will come when the\r\n    negro must bow to this as to the inevitable. Why, because he\r\n    is black and is supposed to possess a soul, we should consider\r\n    him, on account of that combination, exempt, it is difficult\r\n    to understand, when a little firmness would transform him from\r\n    a useless and dangerous brute into a source of benefit to the\r\n    country and of satisfaction to himself.”\r\n\r\nWhat a typical passage is this! The Negro lazy and degraded, useless\r\nand dangerous: the European doing all the work while the Negro smokes\r\nand drinks—whether imported European liquor or liquor manufactured\r\nlocally is not stated: narrow-minded visionaries at home preventing the\r\nsalvation of Africa in the shape of compulsory labour on the Rand mines\r\nwhich constitutes “education”: the perfection of morals that result from\r\nsuch education, and so forth! The crowning folly is conveyed in the\r\nwords “what cannot be utilised must be eliminated,” which, I suppose,\r\nmeans a “thinning-out process”—such as Professor Gregory tells us has\r\nbeen accomplished only too successfully in Unyoro, where “it has been\r\nestimated that in the four years following the establishment of British\r\nrule the population was reduced to a fourth”—in order to prevent the too\r\nrapid propagation of these “hot-house weeds!” And yet what Mr. Grogan\r\nsays is repeated by many and believed by more—the mass who swallow\r\nthis tainted diet as though ’twere nectar, and absorb these grotesque\r\ndistortions as if they were gospel truths.\r\n\r\nLet us endeavour to examine this question in a practical, temperate, and\r\nimpartial spirit. According to ethnologists, the true, uncontaminated\r\nNegro is only found in West Africa, roughly from Senegal to the Rio\r\ndel Rey. He inhabits the coastwise regions and the forest belt. The\r\ninnumerable creeks and forests of the Niger Delta shelter the purest\r\nspecimens, ethnologically, of his race. South of Rio del Rey the Bantu\r\nstock begins, and predominates as you work southward. Behind the forest\r\nbelt the true Negro stock has become changed and modified by infusion\r\nof Berber and Fulani, and also, but to a lesser degree, of Arab blood.\r\nIn the Niger bend, in the regions round about Lake Chad, in Northern\r\nNigeria this blending of races has created a bewildering variety of mixed\r\ntypes, while here and there both the invaded and invading elements have\r\npreserved their purity—for instance, among the Negroes, the Bambarra\r\nof the Upper Niger; among the Berbers, the noble Imosagh; among the\r\nArabs, the Shuwa; among the Fulani, the Pullo herdsmen of Futa Jallon,\r\nAdamawa, Bondu, and of many other parts of the Western Sudan. Leaving\r\nwest for east, you have the Shoa, Galla, Somali, and Jew in Abyssinia\r\nand its confines; then the Bantu—product, as Dr. Voight thinks, of\r\nSemitic and Negro mixture—spreading southwards, inwards and westwards;\r\nuniversal everywhere, right down to the Cape—the Masai, Wahuma, Pigmies,\r\nHottentots; and, in the French Congo, the Fans, presenting small channels\r\nof ethnic divergence in a vast sea of Bantu stock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WEST AFRICAN “YOUNG HOPEFULS”]\r\n\r\nThroughout all this huge expanse of territory the soil is in the main\r\nso fertile that it produces with little trouble everything which the\r\nnative requires for his subsistence and his comfort, where his sense of\r\nwhat constitutes comfort has not expanded as the result of intercourse\r\nwith a higher ethical development—a “higher civilisation,” to use the\r\nhackneyed term. The climate being mostly hot, it militates against great\r\nphysical energy, which, moreover, is not, and has not been, economically\r\nnecessary for the African for countless generations. The degree of\r\ndevelopment of the native depends upon the extent of his contact with,\r\nor remoteness from, influences tending to create in his mind fresh\r\nideas; a higher conception of arts and crafts—influences which may\r\nhave filtered through to him either by the medium of trade, successive\r\nmigration, conquest by a more advanced race, or the infiltration of a\r\nrevealed religion. The more inaccessible the region, the further inland\r\nthe people, the wider removed from highways of commerce their situation,\r\nthe more primitive their state. That is logical, although there are, of\r\ncourse, exceptions. But that in his primitive state the African is the\r\n“useless and dangerous brute” which the shallow materialism, the frenzy\r\nfor expansion, the unthinking, rather blatant callousness of the hour\r\nwould make him out to be, is one of the many fictions which pass for\r\ntruths about Africa. The Wa-Kavirondo are the most primitive people in\r\nthe Uganda Protectorate. They go absolutely naked, are more moral than\r\ntheir partly clothed neighbours, and are agriculturists. “Wherever they\r\nsettle, the jungle around them is soon converted into fruitful fields,\r\nyielding sweet potatoes, or various forms of corn. Those who can afford\r\nit keep goats and sheep, and the wealthy have herds of cattle,” says\r\nDr. Ansorge, adding that among them, “where the European villain with\r\nhis lies and frauds has not yet made his appearance, the white man’s\r\nsimple word is equal to a solemn and a binding oath.” In most parts of\r\nAfrica, south of the equator—in the huge central portion at any rate—in\r\nthe Upper Nile valley, the region traversed by Mr. Grogan, the native\r\nhas never had the motive, the spontaneous impetus to produce more than\r\nhis needs required or his fancy led him to. Yet he works in iron, moulds\r\npottery, has in many cases a highly developed artistic instinct,[150]\r\nmanufactures cloth and ingenious and elaborate weapons of offence, has\r\nsome notions of harmony, and often enough a vein of true poetic instinct.\r\nWhen local conditions have been favourable to the evolving of important\r\nsocial agglomerations, a native state form has grown up which was a cause\r\nof abundant astonishment to the early European travellers in Central\r\nAfrica. Yet, as far back as we are able to plunge in the dim recesses\r\nof the past, these millions of natives—this “mass of inertia”—were\r\nentirely cut off from intercourse with the outside world, isolated from\r\nall contact with the “superior” races. A few stray Egyptian traders\r\nprobably penetrated to the head waters of the Nile and the Great Lakes.\r\nLater on, a handful of Arabs wandered inwards from Zanzibar, but until\r\nBurton, Speke and Grant, Livingstone (working from the south), Baker,\r\nEmin, and Stanley revealed the interior of Africa, its inhabitants had\r\nbeen innocent of all communication with the higher culture. One need not\r\ninquire whether the lot of these people has been much brighter since\r\nthe advent among them of the half-caste Arab slave-trader, the Belgian\r\nivory and rubber hunter, the over-zealous European missionary, and the\r\nland-grabbing fever of the Powers. An estimate on that point must be\r\nlargely a matter of opinion. But to expect that these natives are going\r\nto willingly emigrate _en masse_ to the Rhodesian mines, hire themselves\r\nout for the performance of arduous labour, dig, delve, undertake\r\nplantation work and the like with the zeal of a European workman anxious\r\nto earn a living wage, is a piece of consummate folly. They can only\r\nbe induced to do so by the most tactful treatment; by the payment of a\r\ndecent wage; by the selection of European agents possessing some sense\r\nof proportion, and at least a rudimentary knowledge of the teachings\r\nof history. To attempt to revolutionise these peoples’ conceptions in\r\na few years is madness, and to try and drive them by coercive measures\r\nconstitutes a policy at once immoral, short-sighted, and disastrous.[151]\r\n\r\nUntil quite recently British West Africa remained unaffected in any\r\nmaterial sense by the gradual gravitation of European public opinion\r\ntowards the use of coercion in dealing with the African, together with\r\nthe non-recognition of native land tenure and the various concomitants of\r\nthe “exploitation” policy. The birth of a scientific gold-mining industry\r\nin the Gold Coast, however, has let loose a flood of ignorant talk\r\nabout West Africa, and raised up a whole host of evil advisers who are\r\nbusily intent in introducing South African methods in the West African\r\ngoldfields. Constant complaints are being raised about the scarcity of\r\nlabour, the indolence and the slothfulness of the native. Experienced men\r\nlike Mr. Daw, of the Ashanti goldfields, have not hesitated to speak out\r\nboldly against these views; and so far the Colonial Office,[152] to its\r\nhonour be it said, has refused to yield to the clamour, and has declined\r\nto repeal the law on the acquisition, extent, and registration of mining\r\nconcessions whereby the rights of the native owners of the soil are amply\r\nsafeguarded. In that respect the Concessions Ordinance must rank as the\r\nmost equitable legislative measure for the protection and preservation of\r\nnative land tenure which exists in West Africa. It is true that of the\r\nnumerous complaints which the Ordinance has given rise to, those that\r\nrefer to the actual working of the measure are justified. The machinery\r\nfor registration is hardly complete enough, and in that and some other\r\nrespects matters might be improved. It is also true that cases have\r\noccurred where native chiefs have, knowingly or unknowingly, sold their\r\nproperties twice over, and thus perpetrated a fraud which, no doubt, is\r\nexceedingly reprehensible; but certainly not more so than the numerous\r\nfrauds deliberately consummated by sundry Gold Coast company promoters in\r\nfoisting upon the British public bogus concerns, causing pecuniary loss\r\nto hundreds and thousands of English men and women. The African chief who\r\nindulges in sharp practice can be punished in the Gold Coast, but his\r\nEuropean prototype generally manages to escape the clutches of the law.\r\nIt is to be hoped that the Colonial Office will maintain the Concessions\r\nOrdinance in its integrity, while perfecting the machinery to administer\r\nit, for the law, as a law, is a credit to British justice in West Africa.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is much to be regretted that the Colonial Office\r\nshould have framed a code of laws and regulations in respect to the\r\ndevelopment of forest products and the attribution of forest reserves,\r\nin Southern Nigeria, which have given rise to grave objection, and must\r\ncontinue to do so. The effect of these regulations in the aggregate is\r\nto authorise the High Commissioner to issue any rules he chooses with\r\nregard to all kinds of forest produce, not excepting the produce of the\r\npalm. No proper distinction is drawn between so-called “waste”[153]\r\nlands and forest lands at the disposal of the native and the Government\r\nrespectively. Natives are to be compelled to take out licences to enable\r\nthem to do what they have hitherto done without restriction. The licences\r\nare to be granted by the Government officials. Half the money goes to the\r\nlocal treasury, the other half to the native owner, but only if he can\r\nshow that he is entitled to it! The native is tried, under the penalties\r\nprovided by the proclamation, by the European officer and not by his own\r\nlocal court. All this is bad and short-sighted policy. It must inevitably\r\ntend to suggest to the native mind that the Government is taking entire\r\npossession of his land. His rights of land tenure are being treated as\r\nthough they had ceased to exist, and had been vested in the Government.\r\nWe are officially assured that the native chiefs are satisfied that\r\nthis is not the case, and that they welcome these regulations. It is\r\nimpossible to regard these assurances otherwise than with scepticism. In\r\nSouthern Nigeria the Crown Colony Government is a despotism absolute and\r\nentire. There is no legislative council; there are no native newspapers.\r\nThe native has no means of ventilating his grievances. The powers of\r\nthe High Commissioner are more sweeping than that of the Tsar of all\r\nthe Russias. There is no check upon him, no control of any kind. He\r\ndoes exactly what he likes, and “force” in Southern Nigeria, in other\r\nwords, punitive expeditions are but of too frequent occurrence. For\r\nupwards of three-quarters of a century the natives of Southern Nigeria\r\nhave been encouraged by successive British Governments in the belief\r\nthat they were free to utilise the products of their own forests. I\r\ndefy any jurist to say what amount of freedom they will enjoy if these\r\nregulations are carried out to the letter. I have sought the opinion\r\nof English lawyers not unversed in native law on this matter, and they\r\nhave been anything but impressed with the justice or legality of the\r\nmeasure. The regulations have been compared to a retrogression “to the\r\ndays of William the Conqueror.” “The interpretation of the Commissioner’s\r\npowers, under this Ordinance”—I am quoting from the letter of a lawyer\r\nto whom I submitted the measures in question—“are far too arbitrary.\r\nWhat privileges are left to the native who, you will remember, is the\r\nowner of the soil? It seems that he is in the unfortunate position of\r\nbeing the owner of his land without being able to obtain the slightest\r\nadvantage from that land, and if he attempts to deal with the products\r\nthereof, even with the very best intentions, he is liable at the will\r\nof the Commissioner to imprisonment or fine as provided by the Bill.\r\nThis is surely not the intention of the framer of the Bill; at least I\r\nhope not.” The Chambers of Commerce on the one hand, and the Aborigines\r\nProtection Society on the other, have protested against this reactionary\r\nlegislation, which shows that both in commercial and philanthropic\r\ncircles a similarity of feeling exists in regard to its tenour. It is one\r\nthing “to protect the forests from destruction,” which is understood to\r\nbe the motive of these regulations, and no reasonable being would object\r\nto the framing of common-sense rules for the preservation of rubber trees\r\nand vines (although it is not rules but _instruction_ which is required)\r\nand certain young hardwood trees of slow growth; but it is quite\r\nanother thing to introduce a series of cast-iron laws of this wholesale\r\ncharacter, of doubtful legality, of still more questionable expediency,\r\ninevitably calculated to lead to friction and distinctly prejudicial\r\nto the development of legitimate commerce. The Crown Colony system in\r\nthe Rivers has not been such a brilliant success that it can afford to\r\ndeliberately run such risks! These proclamations, it may be added, were\r\npassed into law in Southern Nigeria without the merchants who supply the\r\nwhole revenue of the country being advised or even consulted. Such is the\r\nbusiness-like method with which we conduct our affairs in West Africa!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN IBO FAMILY GROUP—SOUTHERN NIGERIA]\r\n\r\nIn Lagos, where a similar measure was introduced (it should be stated\r\nthat the law is of home manufacture), it met with considerable native\r\nopposition, and passed through several stages of amendment before\r\nbecoming law. In Lagos there is a legislative council on which natives\r\nsit—in a minority it is true—and there are local newspapers. Channels\r\nexist, therefore, through which native opinion can make itself heard.\r\nThere is also, happily, a Governor of the widest sympathies, of great\r\nand extensive knowledge and experience. Under his auspices we may feel\r\nassured that nothing will be wittingly done to alienate native rights in\r\nland. The Bill, as amended, provides that it shall be open to the duly\r\nconstituted Native Councils, or Governments, of the inland protected\r\nStates, to construe its clauses in accordance with native custom and\r\nusage; and as the chiefs are just as interested in preserving their\r\nforests as the legislators or the merchants, we may feel tolerably sure\r\nthat the objects aimed at will be secured. Moreover, it is further\r\nprovided that the Native Councils shall themselves issue licences\r\nwhen required, the proceeds of which shall come to their own local\r\ntreasuries entirely; and shall themselves inflict fines under their own\r\nlaw, and in their own courts; and the Governor is further recommending\r\nthat the Government reserves shall be conveyed under lease.[154]\r\nThere you observe the difference between the two procedures. The one\r\narbitrary, dogmatic, despotic—the other such as it is seen to be. If\r\nany difficulties arise in Lagos in the course of the working of the\r\nBill,[155] it will not be for the want of doing everything possible\r\nto avert them, of surrounding the rights of native land tenure with\r\nsafeguards which, so long as they are adhered to, will be sufficient\r\nto protect them, of imbuing the native mind with the feeling that\r\nthe Administration intends to conform to the traditions of native\r\nusage; but they will be due to the principle involved in the Bill, the\r\nprinciple, that is, of a _primâ facie_ right of interference, directly\r\nor indirectly, on the part of the Government, in the affairs of native\r\nStates, whose internal independence in contradistinction to their\r\nexternal relations is guaranteed by treaty. On that point opinion will\r\ndiffer, and some of us will continue to think that, in all matters\r\naffecting native industries, instruction is better than restriction.[156]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nA COTTON INDUSTRY FOR WEST AFRICA\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the past few months a subject of the greatest possible moment to\r\nWest Africa, and of vital importance to no inconsiderable section of the\r\ninhabitants of Great Britain, has been discussed in concrete fashion, and\r\nthere is every reason to hope—nay more, to feel assured—that practical\r\nresults will follow. I refer to the movement for the promotion of\r\ncotton-growing in West Africa.\r\n\r\nWhat has already been done may be stated in a few words. On May 8 a\r\nmemorable meeting was held at the Albion Hotel, Manchester, under the\r\nauspices of Mr. Arthur Hutton, the President of the Manchester Chamber of\r\nCommerce. The Chambers of Commerce of London, Liverpool, and Oldham were\r\nrepresented at the meeting, together with the managing director of the\r\nBritish West African Steamship Lines, Sir Alfred Jones,[157] the Oldham\r\nCotton Spinners Association, the Manchester Cotton Spinners’ Association,\r\nvarious other associations of a similar character from Blackburn and\r\nother Lancashire towns, the West African merchants, cotton merchants,\r\nbrokers, weavers and manufacturers, &c. The object of the meeting was\r\nto widen the area of cotton cultivation under the British flag, more\r\nespecially in West Africa, and before the close of the proceedings a\r\n“British Cotton Growing Association” had been formed with a preliminary\r\ncapital of £10,000, to be exclusively devoted to experimenting in West\r\nAfrica and other over-sea possessions. This meeting was followed by\r\nanother held in Manchester in June, in the course of which the decision\r\narrived at previously was confirmed and enlarged, and it was decided to\r\nraise a fund of £50,000. The resolutions passed at this second meeting\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\n                          RESOLUTIONS.\r\n\r\n    “(1) That, in the opinion of this meeting, the continued\r\n    prosperity of the British cotton industry depends on an\r\n    increased supply of cotton, and it is desirable that our\r\n    sources of supply should be extended.\r\n\r\n    “(2) That in order to attain this end an association be formed,\r\n    to be called the British Cotton Growing Association.\r\n\r\n    “(3) That its principal object be the extension of the growth\r\n    and cultivation of cotton in British colonies, dependencies,\r\n    and protectorates.\r\n\r\n    “(4) That a guarantee fund of £50,000 be raised, to be spread\r\n    over five years, no guarantor being required to contribute more\r\n    than one-fifth of his total guarantee in any one year.\r\n\r\n    “(5) That this association shall have power to form a\r\n    subsidiary company, or companies, and to dispose of any of\r\n    its assets to any company thus formed, on conditions that\r\n    subscribers to this association have the first option of\r\n    taking up shares in any such company in proportion to their\r\n    subscriptions.\r\n\r\n    “(6) That a general committee should be appointed.\r\n\r\n    “(7) That this general committee should appoint from their\r\n    number members to form the executive committee.\r\n\r\n    “(8) That the executive committee shall immediately collect\r\n    all the available information on the subject and despatch\r\n    expert expeditions to report on the best methods of procedure,\r\n    and shall have power to (_a_) acquire land on which to make\r\n    experiments and to establish plantations; (_b_) distribute seed\r\n    among the natives to encourage them by advice and assistance to\r\n    grow cotton on their own land, and to engage experts for this\r\n    purpose if necessary; (_c_) establish stations to buy and sell\r\n    cotton, or any of its by-products, animals, implements, or any\r\n    other articles or goods necessary for the expeditions; (_d_) to\r\n    adopt any other means that may suggest themselves from time to\r\n    time to attain the object in view.\r\n\r\n    “(9) That the general committee issue a report once each\r\n    half-year of the work which has been done.”\r\n\r\nA third meeting took place at the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce on July\r\n14, in the presence of Sir William MacGregor, Governor of Lagos, and Sir\r\nA. King Harman, Governor of Sierra Leone, when practical ways and means\r\nof promoting the cultivation of cotton in their respective Colonies for\r\nexport to Europe were debated.[158]\r\n\r\nHaving thus briefly indicated the various measures adopted, we may\r\nprofitably inquire into the origin and causes of the movement. That\r\ninquiry cannot fail to impress the thinking public with the importance\r\nof the issues. With every year that passes Great Britain is becoming\r\nmore than ever dependent upon the United States for her cotton supply,\r\nand with every year that passes the increase in the cotton production of\r\nAmerica accentuates itself by comparison with the production of other\r\ncountries. Thus in the decades 1870-80, 1880-90, and 1890-1900 America\r\nhas produced 4½, 6½, and 9½ millions of bales, while India has produced\r\n2, 2½, and 2 millions; Egypt 384,000, 400,000, and 700,000; and Brazil\r\n600,000, 300,000, and 380,000 in the same period. The gradual position\r\nassumed by America as controller of the world’s cotton is, therefore,\r\nclearly apparent, and although the production of Egypt and India is\r\nincreasing, the ratio of increase when compared with America is trifling,\r\nwhile the production from countries outside India and Egypt is decreasing.\r\n\r\nThat is one consideration. Another consideration is this. Forty years ago\r\nEngland took the bulk of American cotton. To-day the Continent, thanks to\r\nthe growth and to the marvellous success of Continental spinners, takes\r\none-third of the entire American crop.\r\n\r\nYet another factor is the increase in the American consumption of cotton.\r\nA few years ago the American _consumption_ of cotton was almost _nil_.\r\nAmerica now consumes a third of her produce. In the opinion of some\r\nexperts—although in some quarters a contrary opinion is held—America\r\nwill consume by the end of next year at least one-half of her production.\r\n\r\nNow these are very serious facts for industrial Lancashire. The terrible\r\ndistress which visited Lancashire in the days of the American Civil\r\nWar is still sufficiently recent to be remembered, and one shudders\r\nto contemplate the consequences which would ensue if anything should\r\nagain prevent Lancashire from obtaining her share of the cotton crop of\r\nAmerica, with nothing but the existing inadequate supplies from other\r\nparts of the world to fall back upon. The danger is a very real and\r\npressing one. As matters stand at present, Great Britain is practically\r\nat the mercy of the United States, and in a position of almost entire\r\ndependence upon the market manipulations of American speculators, in\r\nwhose power it is to regulate the price to suit their own convenience.\r\nSo unsatisfactory is the actual condition of affairs, that for the past\r\nthree years it has hardly paid importers to ship cotton to Liverpool. The\r\nfear of an American syndicating of cotton is not, perhaps, altogether\r\ngroundless in these days of vast trusts and combinations, while the\r\ncompetition from Continental spinners, and, above all, increased\r\nAmerican consumption, make the outlook as gloomy as it well can be. It\r\nis therefore imperative that something be done to increase the area of\r\ncotton production under the British flag. So much for the wider aspect of\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\nThose to whom this matter specially appeals have naturally enough\r\nturned their eyes towards West Africa, and it is in connection with the\r\npossibilities of the development of an export cotton industry in that\r\npart of the world that some remarks may fittingly be made in this volume.\r\nI say an “export” industry, because, as we know, a native industry to\r\nsupply local wants has existed in West Africa for centuries past. We\r\nhave seen, for example, the paramount part which the cotton industry\r\nplays in the prosperity of Kano and Northern Nigeria generally, where,\r\nin addition to supplying local wants, manufactured cotton cloths are an\r\narticle of barter; in some regions indeed a veritable currency, sent\r\nfar and wide to countries of inland Western Africa where the excellence\r\nof the Kano article is in perpetual demand. But what is true of Kano is\r\ntrue of many other portions of West Africa. The cotton shrub (_Gossypium\r\nherbaceum_)[159] is met with in a wild state all over West Africa, and\r\ncultivated very extensively. Wherever Islam has spread, cultivation has\r\nincreased, but in pagan communities the manufacture of cotton cloths\r\nis indulged in to no inconsiderable extent. The pagan tribes of Sierra\r\nLeone, of the Gold Coast and Liberia, turn out the most beautiful cloths.\r\nTheir excellence and felicity of design are such that no one who has seen\r\nthem can fail to be impressed with the capacity of the races, with their\r\nprimitive appliances, which produce them. The endeavour to promote cotton\r\ncultivation on a larger scale in West Africa will not be, therefore, a\r\nnew thing, and what might have been an initial difficulty is happily\r\nnon-existent.\r\n\r\nNor will West Africa be called upon for the first time in its history to\r\nsupply Europe with raw cotton. When the American Civil War broke out,\r\nhigh prices were offered for West African cotton, which was universally\r\npronounced by experts to be of excellent quality. Cotton was exported\r\nin its raw state from the Gold Coast, Fernando Po, Lagos, the Gambia,\r\nand Angola. Indeed the export was continued long after that, and between\r\nthe years 1878 and 1885 raw cotton to the value of £56,501 was shipped\r\nhome to Europe from the Gold Coast and Lagos. Even before the American\r\nWar, as was recently recalled to memory by Mr. Elijah Helm,[160] himself\r\na Quaker, the constitutional objections of the Quakers to utilise the\r\nproducts of slave labour led to the formation of a small association,\r\nwhich imported cotton from West Africa of a quality so good, and in\r\nquantities so considerable, as to provide for the not very extensive\r\nwants of the Quaker fraternity.\r\n\r\nBut with the close of the war, and the considerable fall in price since\r\nthose days, the West African export cotton industry has become virtually\r\nextinct. A very little, I believe, still finds it sway to Europe from\r\nthe banks of the Volta and from Angola, but that is all, with the\r\nexception of the Togoland experiment of last year, of which I shall speak\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nThe four main requirements for the successful cultivation of cotton are:\r\n(1) a suitable soil, (2) adequate irrigation or a regularly recurring\r\nrainfall, (3) sufficient labour, (4) transport facilities. British West\r\nAfrica can, in the main, give the first three, in some places better than\r\nin others. British West Africa’s capacity to furnish the fourth depends\r\nupon whether the grassy upland plains of the interior may be considered\r\nmore fitting or less fitting than the swampy, better-watered regions of\r\nthe coast. If the former be thought the most likely, the country behind\r\nLagos alone affords the necessary qualifications at present. Lagos,\r\nmoreover, is particularly fitted in respect to the third requirement,\r\nthat of labour. A railway 125 miles long runs up from Lagos town to the\r\ninterior, passing through the naturally rich and productive belt of\r\nforest, where it is hopeless to expect, and where it would be dangerous\r\nto attempt to promote, cotton cultivation. But beyond the forest belt\r\na park-like country opens out of an area of some 10,000 square miles\r\nin extent, the greater proportion of which would be suitable to the\r\ncultivation of cotton, and would go far to justify and hasten, if\r\ntaken up in earnest, the extension of the existing railway line to the\r\nNiger. If, therefore, it be a question of experimenting in a region of\r\ngrass-covered plains—similar to those of Texas—Lagos, by reason of its\r\nrailway, is the only British colony where such experiments can at present\r\nbe undertaken. The intelligence of the Yorubas, their agricultural and\r\nindustrial capacity, the dense agglomeration of population met with in\r\nthe country, the need of providing or strengthening the _economic_, as\r\nopposed to the strategic, argument for a continuation of the line (let\r\nus fervently trust under different conditions) to the Niger; all those\r\nfactors render it in the highest degree to be hoped that Lagos may be\r\nchosen as a centre of activity for the new movement. Lagos, let it never\r\nbe forgotten, is one of the doors of Northern Nigeria.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the consensus of expert opinion favours the\r\nlow-lying coastwise regions, where fluvial transport to the actual port\r\nof shipment is relatively easy, the Gambia and Southern Nigeria primarily\r\nsuggest themselves. Those possessions seem to me to offer advantages\r\nover Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast. The present condition of Sierra\r\nLeone is not encouraging. The railway, if it achieves anything at all,\r\nwhich is doubtful, can only do so by increasing the yield of the fruit\r\nof the palm, and by bringing the interior oil-palm districts into closer\r\ntouch with the coast markets. This may enable that unfortunate Colony\r\nto bear the heavy burden under which it is now staggering. To cut down\r\nthe forests in the Eastern districts of Sierra Leone in order to plant\r\ncotton would be suicidal. In the Gold Coast, again, there is an opposing\r\nfactor in the shape of the gold-mining industry. The mining companies are\r\nperpetually grumbling about the scarcity of labour, for which in many\r\ncases they have themselves to thank. Their demands upon the population\r\nhave already resulted in drawing away a number of people from their usual\r\navocations, with the result that the export of timber is decreasing; and\r\nany further deviation of available labour, such as the cultivation of\r\ncotton would necessitate, would seriously affect the producing capacity\r\nof the country, not only as regards timber, but in respect to other\r\nnatural and cultivated products, such as palm oil and kernels in the\r\nfirst category, and cocoa in the other.\r\n\r\nFor the Gambia, on the other hand, the advent of a new industry would be\r\na boon. The Gambia entirely relies for its existence upon the ground-nut.\r\nIt is always a bad thing to have all your eggs in one basket. When an\r\narticle like the ground-nut is in question, it is very bad, because\r\nyou are at the mercy, as it were, of the seasons. The ground-nut is\r\nnecessarily a fluctuating article on that account, and one year may\r\nproduce a fine crop, to be followed the next by an indifferent one. Sir\r\nGeorge Denton—the genial and popular Governor of the Gambia—intended, I\r\nknow, to try and start a better system of irrigation in certain parts of\r\nthat Colony, in order to widen the extent of ground-nut producing land,\r\nand any such project would be all to the good, of course, for cotton\r\ncultivation. The population of the Gambia being mostly Mohammedan and\r\nlargely composed of those most enterprising people the Mandingoes, and\r\nMandingoes crossed with Fulani blood—remnant of the old empire of Melle—a\r\ncotton industry (to which they are long inured) could be started with so\r\nmuch greater hope of success from this fact.\r\n\r\nIn Southern Nigeria[161] the field is vast. You can march for miles on\r\neither bank of the main river through a cotton-growing country. The\r\ndensity of the population varies, of course, in different districts.\r\nFluvial means of transport abound. The people, it is true, are not\r\nblessed, or cursed, with many wants; but there is no valid reason\r\nwhy, with a little painstaking care and sympathetic treatment; with\r\nimprovements in the production of kernels which, as already suggested,\r\nwould release a considerable amount of native labour for other pursuits;\r\nwith a greater display of combination between the official and mercantile\r\nclass; with a good deal less blood-letting, fewer punitive expeditions,\r\n“clearing away of the refuse of the population,” “drastic measures,” and\r\nso forth; the natives of Southern Nigeria should not be induced to take\r\nup cotton cultivation for purposes of export.\r\n\r\nGranted the necessity; given the soil, irrigation rainfall, labour and\r\ntransport, as specifically mentioned above; admitted an experience in\r\ncotton growing, spinning and weaving among the natives; what remains to\r\nbe studied in this great enterprise destined, let us hope, to make of\r\nBritish West Africa a great cotton-producing country on which England can\r\ncount in case of need; to assist in freeing us to a large extent from\r\na position of dependence upon America, and so prevent the accumulating\r\ndangers of the hour, and of which the creation cannot fail to confer the\r\ngreatest benefit upon the British West African possessions?\r\n\r\nObviously the first consideration is one of price. Can a cotton industry\r\nin West Africa be made to pay? Can sufficient inducement be offered\r\nto the native to encourage him to produce cotton for export? Can West\r\nAfrican cotton compete with any degree of success against the American\r\nproduct in the matter of price? On what lines can a cotton industry in\r\nWest Africa be promoted? Based upon the data available, which are not, of\r\ncourse, by any means complete, the general consensus of opinion amongst\r\nexperts appears to be that, with the inculcation of scientific methods of\r\ncultivation, the treatment of the cotton shrub as an annual instead of a\r\nperennial, the introduction of the necessary implements and of ginning\r\nand compressing machinery it will be possible to make cotton-growing\r\nprofitable. In this respect the experiments of the Germans in Togoland\r\nare particularly interesting. To Germany belongs the credit of initiating\r\nthe new cotton movement. From the German Colony of Togo came last\r\nyear, for the first time in its history, fifteen thousand marks worth\r\nof cotton. The conclusions of the German Agricultural Committee were\r\nprecise. The absence of adequate transport facilities alone prevented the\r\ncomplete financial success of the first experiment. Further, it was shown\r\nupon analysis that, of the various types of cotton raised from American,\r\nEgyptian, Indian and native seed, the type raised from the native seed\r\nproduced, as a whole, the best staple, equal in quality to average\r\nAmerican. This absence of transport is likely to be remedied in time,\r\nas a survey is now being made for a railway from the coast to Misahöhe.\r\nMeanwhile the Germans are so far from being discouraged that a company\r\nis, I understand, about to be brought out for the express purpose of\r\ndeveloping the cotton industry in Togo[162] with a capital of £37,500.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRAVELLING ON THE NIGER IN THE DRY SEASON]\r\n\r\nThe French are also devoting a great deal of attention to the subject\r\njust now. Some years ago the then military Governor of the French Sudan,\r\nGénéral de Trentinian, took the matter up. Nothing came of his efforts,\r\nbut M. Roume, the new Governor-General of French West Africa, has\r\nnow adopted it as one of the planks of his platform, so to speak. He\r\nis anxious to establish a cotton industry in Senegal, which, like the\r\nGambia, lives upon ground-nut production. More ambitious schemes are\r\nvaguely mooted, and some enthusiasts already speak and write as though\r\nthe valley of the Upper Niger were about to be converted, as it were by a\r\nflash of the magician’s wand, into a rival of the Southern States. That\r\nwith its magnificent soil and splendid natural irrigation the valley of\r\nthe Upper Niger may some day fulfil the aspirations of the French is,\r\nperhaps, more than possible.[163] But we are a long way off that yet.\r\n\r\nIt seems difficult, then, to believe that this simultaneous impulse on\r\nthe part of competent men in England, Germany and France can be founded\r\nupon a miscalculation in respect to working expenses, and I think we may\r\nfeel tolerably certain that, if cotton costs an average per lb. of 2⅛\r\n_d._ to produce in Texas, such parts of West Africa as can be endowed\r\nwith similar facilities in respect to machinery, and where transport,\r\neither by rail or water, is available, will be able to produce cotton at\r\na lower figure; and as the interest of the West African shipowners is to\r\nfill their ships homeward bound from the West Coast, we may also presume\r\nthat they will make reasonable concessions to encourage the industry.[164]\r\n\r\nThere remains the question of how to set about establishing a cotton\r\nindustry in West Africa upon a sound basis. Shall it be attempted in\r\nthe form of plantations managed by white overseers and with paid native\r\nlabour; or shall it be left very largely to native initiative, and\r\ndevelop itself on the lines of a native industry—as, I believe, is the\r\ncase in India? I think that all who have some knowledge of West African\r\nmatters will unhesitatingly pronounce in favour of the latter solution.\r\nWest Africa is essentially a country of native industries, and the best\r\neconomic results have been obtained in West Africa when the motive power\r\nall through has been the native, with the European as teacher, instructor\r\nand guide, but _not_ as manager or director of native labour.[165] In\r\nthe construction of public works the same phenomenon is observable in\r\na somewhat different form. Experience has demonstrated that where the\r\nrecruiting of labour for railways or road construction has been left in\r\nthe hands of the chiefs, requisite labour was forthcoming, and sufficient\r\nleft on the farms to allow usual production, and therefore the export\r\ntrade has remained unaffected; whereas when recruiting operations have\r\nbeen directed by Europeans outside the authority of the chiefs, labour\r\nwas indeed obtainable, but at the cost of disorganising the general\r\nlabour supply of the country and consequently affecting adversely the\r\nexport trade.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of these facts suggests, therefore, that the cotton industry\r\ncan be promoted with the greatest chance of success by interesting the\r\nrulers of the country and their councils in the movement; by giving the\r\nchiefs the benefit of expert advice; by enlisting their sympathies and\r\ngood-will; by supplying them with cotton seed, implements, and possibly\r\nhand-gins, gratis; and so on. Here at least the necessity of proceeding\r\non lines of instruction entirely is manifest. The object is to improve\r\nan existing industry, to greatly enlarge and systematise it, _to get the\r\npeople of the land interested in it_. If the native can see a profit in\r\nthe business, he will take it up. That is morally certain. It has been\r\nso in every branch of West African commerce. So keenly has the native\r\nembraced new trade outlets offered to him that upon occasion he has, when\r\nuninstructed in the art of production, compromised the future. Absolute\r\nand entire co-operation of officialdom and commerce is essential if the\r\ncotton movement in West Africa is to be attended with success. The\r\nGermans may here serve us as a model to imitate. The home Government,\r\nthe local Government; the forces of industry and commerce in Germany,\r\nand in the particular Colony where the experiments are being made, have\r\nvied with one another in the effort to achieve an aim of common interest\r\nto all. Centres of instruction have been established in the Colony;\r\nmodel farms have been created; Negro farmers from the States have been\r\nbrought over through the instrumentality of Mr. Booker T. Washington, the\r\ndistinguished Negro scholar and manager of the Tuskegee Institute.[166]\r\nIn all these matters the official world has worked hand in glove with the\r\ncommercial world.\r\n\r\nIt is equally important that the cotton associations and merchants should\r\nbe in earnest. No mere pecking will suffice. Disappointments and delays\r\nmust be discounted in advance. There are sure to be plenty of both.\r\nGinning and compressing machinery must be set up either on the coast,\r\nor, if it be decided to try Lagos, at large centres such as Ibadan and\r\nAbbeokuta; and preferably what is known as the “American round lap,”\r\nwhich ensures simultaneous ginning and compressing in 250 lb. round\r\nbales, instead of the more cumbrous and more expensive separate ginning\r\nand compressing machines, which produce the 500 lb. square bale. In\r\nshort, the movement must be engineered, from the beginning, on a real\r\nscientific basis. If Togoland with its transport difficulties has been\r\nable in the first year’s experience to export 70,000 decimal pounds of\r\ncotton, what may not be achieved by those of our West African Colonies\r\nwhere transport facilities exist; where the population is at least as\r\ndense if not denser; and where British subjects have been in contact with\r\nthe natives for periods ranging from fifty to one hundred years?\r\n\r\nI cannot leave this subject without referring to the indirect relation\r\nit bears to the Negro problem in the States. At present all is vague\r\nand uncertain. We cannot tell what may be the outcome of the movement;\r\nbut if it be a success, what vistas does it not open up for the future!\r\nWe have seen how the Germans have invited the co-operation of American\r\nNegro cotton farmers. The few who have gone out—the German reports assure\r\nus—have elected to remain. More, it is announced, are to follow. What\r\nwould the attitude of the American Government be in the face of a steady\r\nflow of emigration on the part of the coloured population of the Southern\r\nStates, to help to build up in its country of origin what it has built up\r\nin America? In what light would the Americans regard the up-springing of\r\na great cotton industry in West Africa? If, as events seem to indicate,\r\nAmerica is likely to become on an ever-increasing scale the principal\r\nconsumer of her own raw cotton, would such an occurrence be viewed with\r\nequanimity by the American public? Or if not with actual equanimity,\r\nwith at least the feeling that the danger, presuming it to be one, might\r\nbe cheerfully faced if a deeper peril could thereby be diminished, and\r\nin time perhaps altogether removed? Could white labour in the American\r\ncotton plantations, with the exception of the more swampy and malarial\r\nregions, be substituted for Negro labour, in the event of appreciable\r\nemigration? These are questions for American statesmen and thinkers\r\nto answer. If American intelligence can perceive in these tentative\r\nsuggestions a clue, be it ever so faint now, of future potentialities,\r\na clue worth following up and investigating, let America remember that\r\na million square miles of African territory, which was declared in 1884\r\ninternationally free commercial land, and in the consolidation of which\r\nunder its present _régime_ America is to a large degree responsible, is\r\nin the grip to-day of a band of greedy monopolists in whose bowels reside\r\nno scruples, no pity, no humanity; who are sowing red ruin wherever their\r\ninfluence can be asserted. If America ever seriously turns her attention\r\nto West Africa as a solution of the greatest problem of her internal\r\npolitics, let her cast her eyes upon the Congo State, misnamed Free—the\r\nabode of cruelty and persecution, of slavery and reaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE MAHOGANY TRADE\r\n\r\n    “The traveller who wanders through the dim recesses of the\r\n    tropical forest of Western Africa soon feels the sense of\r\n    its beauty lost in that of its mournful grandeur, and there\r\n    steals over him a profound feeling of solitude and a deep\r\n    consciousness of the solemnity, majesty, and utter loneliness\r\n    of this great, gloomy wilderness.”—Dr. AUSTIN FREEMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great forest region of Africa is one of the wonders of the world.\r\nIt is a moot point whether Africa should be described as possessing two\r\nforest belts or only one. Roughly speaking, the forest region takes the\r\nform of an inverted hatchet or axe, with French Congo, the Congo Free\r\nState, and a portion of the Great Lakes districts as the blade; while\r\nthe West Coast, from Sierra Leone downwards, provides the handle. There\r\nare gaps here and there; in the Cameroon hinterland; among the mangrove\r\nswamps of the Niger Delta, and behind Lagos on the Niger side. The\r\nforest is densest in the Upper Congo, where Stanley, we know, struggled\r\nin it for many weary weeks, as though held in the grip of some hideous\r\nnightmare from which there was no escape.\r\n\r\nIn this natural hot-house, always bathed in an atmosphere of humidity and\r\nsteam, vegetation flourishes in the wildest profusion and exuberance, and\r\nwith the widest diversity of size and species, from the mighty _bombax_\r\nto the creeping lichen. So abundant is this luxurious growth, so thick\r\nthe canopy formed by the spreading branches and creepers overhead,\r\nthat, save here and there, where some giant has fallen and broken down\r\nthe surrounding undergrowth, leaving a gap overhead through which the\r\nsunlight penetrates flickeringly, the forest is plunged in eternal\r\ngloom. This gloom and the silence which accompanies it are the two\r\ngreat characteristics of the African forest. Except for the occasional\r\nchattering of monkeys, the crash of a falling tree, or the far-off\r\nchirrup of birds, who seek the sunlight in the topmost branches, the\r\nsilence broods everlastingly. The effect of living amongst this gloom\r\nand silence is most depressing to the European, and it is no matter for\r\nsurprise that the terrific solemnity of their environment should have\r\nexercised a profound influence upon the naturally superstitious minds\r\nof the native Africans who dwell therein. It is amongst the dwellers in\r\nthe forest region that we find the lowest type of African humanity[167]\r\nand the most sombre developments of African religious conceptions. All\r\nEuropean travellers who have spent some time in this great forest region\r\nhave been alike impressed by its grandeur and its melancholy, and their\r\ndescriptions bear witness to the way in which their feelings have been\r\nwrought upon by the natural phenomena with which they were surrounded.\r\n\r\nIt is only within quite recent years that European enterprise has\r\nconcerned itself with the potential riches of this vast forest region, or\r\nrather of that portion of it which it is as yet possible to commercially\r\ndevelop, viz. the belt on the West Coast—or, to refer to the illustration\r\ngiven above, the handle of the axe. The results already achieved in a\r\nshort period of effort, which can hardly be called more than tentative\r\nand unsystematic, are such as to warrant the most sanguine expectations\r\nfor the future, when facilities of transport shall have brought the main\r\nportion of the forest region within reach of the European markets. It is\r\ncurious to observe how, in its main lines, the trade of Western Africa\r\nhas arisen in a succession of well-defined stages. The earliest trade was\r\nin gold-dust, and, so far as we know, confined to gold-dust, unless the\r\ngorilla (or more probably the chimpanzee) skins brought home by Hanno\r\nbe counted as trade—which would be a somewhat humorous classification.\r\nThen ensued a long period of absolute neglect of West Africa by civilised\r\nman. When once more the latter turned his attention to that part of the\r\nworld, gold was again the principal item of trade, accompanied by ivory,\r\nand later on by slaves—the later a monstrous evil, whose Nemesis is\r\nto-day making itself felt in the United States. The gold trade died out,\r\nthe ivory trade languished, and the gum, palm oil and kernel trades came\r\ninto existence, to be followed by the rubber trade, and lastly by the\r\ntimber trade—principally confined to mahogany. On the principle of _plus\r\nça change, plus c’est la même chose_, the gold industry is now again\r\nreviving, although on very different lines from the old barter system.\r\nThat is, of course, a general statement. There have been, now and then,\r\nexceptions to prove the rule, and so far as timber is concerned, a not\r\ninconsiderable business was carried on in the Gambia and Sierra Leone\r\nsome fifty years ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FELLING A MAHOGANY-TREE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SQUARING THE TREE]\r\n\r\nSir Alfred Moloney, however, was able to write in 1887 that, after having\r\nmade many inquiries, such timber trade as had previously existed “may\r\nbe said to have altogether ceased or to have sunk into the export done\r\nin dye-woods and ebony.” The following tabulated statement shows how\r\ninsignificant was the timber trade in West Africa between the years 1878\r\nand 1885:\r\n\r\n          WOOD AND TIMBER EXPORTS FROM WESTERN AFRICA, 1878 TO 1885.\r\n\r\n  Year.

To-day the mahogany trade has grown to be one of the most\r\nimportant branches of commerce in West Africa. Enormous quantities of\r\nlogs are shipped home from the Gold Coast, Lagos and the Ivory Coast, and\r\nthe mahogany exports from the Niger Coast Protectorate,[168] which were\r\nstarted in August, 1899, produced 23,983 superficial feet in the year\r\n1899-1900.\r\n\r\nThe industry is carried on by two categories of shippers, viz. the\r\nEuropean merchant established on the coast, who either employs native\r\nlabour to cut down his own trees, or who buys timber direct from the\r\nnative; and the native merchant who ships home on commission. The chief\r\ncentres of the mahogany trade on the coast are: for the Gold Coast—Axim,\r\nTwin Rivers, Sekondi and Chama; for the Ivory Coast—Assinie, Half\r\nAssinie, Lahou and Grand Bassam; for Southern Nigeria—Benin and Sapelli.\r\nLagos timber is carried round to Forcados in branch boats, and there\r\nshipped on the homeward-bound steamers. The South Coast mahogany trade\r\nis chiefly confined to Botica Point, Gaboon, Eloby and Mayumba, although\r\na few logs have been sent home in the steamers of the Cie Belge Maritime\r\ndu Congo, from near Boma in the Congo Free State. The South Coast timber\r\ntrade appears to be dying out, owing chiefly to the pale colour of the\r\nwood, which does not now commend itself to buyers.[169] The vast forests\r\nof the Upper Congo cannot, with advantage or profit, be tapped until\r\nthe Congo Railway Company lowers its preposterous rates, and until the\r\nadministration of the country is in other hands than the monopolist\r\nclique which controls it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRAGGING THE SQUARED LOG THROUGH THE BUSH]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAPELLI, SOUTHERN NIGERIA’S PRINCIPAL TIMBER PORT]\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to give the actual exports of timber from the Gold\r\nCoast and Lagos from 1895 to 1899, showing the wonderful strides which\r\nhave taken place.

The statistics of Liverpool\r\nimports from 1889 to 1900 inclusive will be found in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nIn view of the evidence given of the phenomenal increase of the mahogany\r\ntrade, it seems almost incongruous to say that the existing condition\r\nand the future prospects of the trade have, for some months past, been\r\ncausing much apprehension in West African commercial circles. The truth\r\nis that the growth of the trade has been checked, and for the last twelve\r\nmonths has even been showing signs of decay. There was a decreased\r\nexport in 1901 of over 11,000 tons, and the figures for the first six\r\nmonths of the present year show a further decline, although prices have\r\nconsiderably advanced and the demand for good logs exceeds the supply.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact recognised by all the interested parties that the export\r\nof mahogany from West Africa has received a serious check. What are the\r\nreasons? They differentiate with the localities. In the Gold Coast the\r\nfalling off which has occurred is due, in the first place, to labour\r\nbeing attracted from the timber to the gold-mining industry, and to the\r\nneeds of railway construction. Many thousands of natives have thus been\r\ndrawn away from timber-felling to work on the railway; for the mines, or\r\nas carriers for the various prospecting expeditions into the interior.\r\nA second contributory cause has been the necessarily trade-disturbing\r\nelement of warfare, otherwise stated, the Ashanti War, in the shape of\r\nthe general unrest and disorganisation brought about by the excessive\r\ndemands for carriers, &c. In the Ivory Coast, prospecting expeditions\r\nhave also affected the output. As far as Lagos is concerned, the remarks\r\nof the Governor in the last report of that Colony for last year afford\r\nthe requisite explanation.[171]\r\n\r\nThe freight question is undoubtedly held to militate against the\r\ndevelopment of the timber industry, and it had been freely prophesied\r\nthat the effect would begin to make itself felt last year. How much the\r\ndecline was due on the whole to high freights, and how much to other\r\ncauses mentioned, it would be difficult to say. With the technicalities\r\nof the subject I will not bore my readers. Suffice it to say that the\r\nprincipal objection which is advanced against the steamship owners,\r\nis the way in which the system known as the “sliding scale” is worked\r\nout. At present logs over two tons pay increased freight, and a further\r\nincrease is made upon logs of three tons and upwards. It is urged\r\nthat, if the principle of the bigger the log the better the timber\r\nwere sound, this would be all right enough; but it so happens that the\r\naverage sale price of a one-ton log is much the same as that of a two-,\r\nthree- or four-ton log, except when the heavier log is what is termed\r\na good “figured”[172] log. Figured logs fetch any price, according to\r\nthe fancy of the purchaser, and in such cases the question of freight\r\nis a bagatelle. But the vast majority of the logs do not possess these\r\nqualifications, and the increased freight on the heavier logs tells\r\nvery heavily against the merchant, and may even go so far, when low\r\nprices prevail on the home market, as to render any profit on the sale\r\nimpossible. Of course, the steamship owner has his reply ready; and, so\r\nfar, he considers it good enough to justify the existing rates.\r\n\r\nWhen all is said and done, the fact remains that the timber trade is\r\nlanguishing. It would be a thousand pities to allow this to continue,\r\nif it can be avoided. A trade once abandoned or paralysed is not easily\r\nrestarted. It is in the interest of all the parties concerned to arrive\r\nat a _modus vivendi_ which shall allow the native who cuts and squares\r\nthe wood, the merchant who ships it, and the steamship owner who carries\r\nit, to make a profit. In this as in other respects one would like to see\r\nsome systematic measures of instruction adopted, under joint official\r\nand commercial auspices, to show the natives how the best logs can be\r\nselected for felling, which would avoid the sending home of a mass of\r\nworthless and immature timber calculated at times to flood the market and\r\ndepreciate prices, while damaging the forests in Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nISLAM IN WEST AFRICA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe steady and continuous spread of Islam in the western portion of the\r\nDark Continent is a fact which no one acquainted with the subject will\r\nattempt to deny. It is, indeed, so well established that to specialise\r\nparticular instances where it has been observed would be a needless\r\nundertaking. It is everywhere palpable, striking, impressive. It can no\r\nmore be disguised or ignored than the concurrent circumstance of relative\r\nfailure on the part of Christian missions. While Mohammedanism continues\r\nto gain converts far and wide; to absorb whole tribes; to filter down the\r\nrivers to the ocean; to pierce the forest belt, with hardly a check—save\r\nhere and there, as, for example, among the Ibos on the Niger—Christianity\r\nmakes no headway in the interior; and even in its confinement to the\r\ncoastwise region, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say, some of\r\nthe Europeanised towns on the coast, its progress is slow, so slow,\r\nindeed, that well-informed observers are not wanting who believe that it\r\nis losing rather than gaining ground. At any rate, it is not, I venture\r\nto think, an exaggeration to say, Christianity is maintaining itself with\r\ndifficulty among heathen communities in West Africa, and beats in vain\r\nagainst the strong tide of Mohammedanism.[173]\r\n\r\nIt cannot be without interest to Englishmen whose West African Empire\r\ncovers so large an area, and numbers between thirty and forty millions,\r\nto devote careful attention to a subject which is fraught with such\r\nfar-reaching importance, and which it is imperially necessary for Great\r\nBritain to take into serious consideration as constituting a factor which\r\nhas to be reckoned with and appreciated at its proper value. On that\r\naccount it may not be out of place to discuss in a general way the whole\r\nsubject of Mohammedanism in West Africa. The problem is a great one, and\r\nalthough there is no pretence here to more than touch the fringe of it,\r\neven a tentative effort is, perhaps, of interest to the daily increasing\r\nsection of the public, which begins, although still but dimly, to realise\r\nthe nature and the extent of the responsibilities Great Britain has\r\nundertaken in West Africa.\r\n\r\nRejecting, as, in my opinion, we can do with safety, the legend that\r\nattributes the existence of Mohammedanism in Walata (Biru), the seat\r\nof the Ghanata Empire as early as the sixtieth year of the Hejira, or\r\nabout 682 A.D., there is yet good reason to believe that Islam crossed\r\nthe Sahara, and became powerful in the Western Sudan, earlier than the\r\neleventh century A.D., which is the period assigned to that event by the\r\nmajority of authorities. We know positively that the fifteenth prince of\r\nthe first and Za dynasty of the Songhay, Za Kasai, was converted to Islam\r\nin the year 1000 A.D.[174] From El Bekri we glean that Mohammedanism\r\nhad taken such firm root in the Songhay Empire about sixty years after\r\nthe conversion of Za Kasai (1067 A.D.) that none but a Muslim could be\r\nking. In the reign of Yusif Ibn Tashfin, the founder of Morocco, 1062\r\nA.D., many Negroes, according to Leo Africanus, became followers of\r\nthe Prophet. Barth’s invaluable “Chronological Table of the History of\r\nBornu” shows us that Islam was introduced into Kanem (and Bornu)[175]\r\nin the reign of Hume, the first of the Muslim rulers of that extensive\r\nEmpire (1086-89), and the circumstance that this potentate died in Masr\r\n(Misr)—_i.e._ Egypt, infers that he was either on his way to or from\r\nMecca.[176] Now it seems inconceivable that Gao or Gogo, the capital\r\nof the Songhay Empire, which was situate on the Niger about 500 miles\r\nin the heart of the country of the Negroes, should have yielded to the\r\ninfluence of Islamic preachers who came from the north, before the\r\nintroduction of that religion in the intervening region comprised between\r\nthe southern limits of the Sahara and the Western Sudan. That it should\r\nhave struck the Niger, and followed it as providing the swiftest vehicle\r\nof penetration inland before permeating the countries that lay on either\r\nside of the river, is natural enough, and we find indirect confirmation\r\nthat it did so in the circumstance that the other great Negro kingdom\r\ncontemporary with Songhay, that of Melle or Mali, which had succeeded\r\nGhanata, only embraced Islam in the person of its king, Baramidana,\r\nin 1213, or about two centuries after the conversion of Za Kasai. It\r\nmay therefore, I think, be assumed, without departing from the limits\r\nof inherent probability, that if the existence of mosques in Walata\r\nwere relegated to 900 A.D. instead of 682 A.D., the former date would\r\napproximately represent the truth; and that Mohammedan proselytisers\r\nmust have been busily at work in the Senegal about that time or a little\r\nlater, pushing southwards and eastwards from thence, until they reached\r\nthe Niger, and pursuing their course onwards to the most important city\r\non its banks, Gao; reaching it, as already stated, in the opening years\r\nof the eleventh century,[177] and having met with success, continuing\r\ntheir triumphal progress to the third great Negro kingdom of West Africa,\r\nKanem.[178]\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Islam revolutionised Western Africa. His first\r\ncontact with a revealed religion powerfully affected the naturally\r\nintense spiritual nature of the Negro. What was the precise nature of\r\nthe religious beliefs entertained by the Songhays, Mandingoes, Fulani,\r\nHausas and other tribes inhabiting the Upper Senegal and Upper Niger at\r\nthe time of the advent of Mohammedanism it is difficult to say. It may\r\nhave been the animism which, under its modern appellation, Fetishism,\r\nis met with to-day in its purest form among the true Negroes of the\r\ncoastwise swamp and forest regions. Or, as is much more probable, it\r\nmay have been a form of pantheism allied with animal worship inherited\r\nfrom contact, at a remote period, with Egyptian culture; as witness the\r\n_Tarik’s_ description of the original fish-god of the Songhays, believed\r\nby some authorities—and not without reason—to have been the manatee;[179]\r\nthe alleged regard of the Mandingoes for the hippopotamus;[180] and the\r\nstrong presumptions of an ancient bovine worship among those Fulani who\r\nhave remained faithful to their original calling of _bororoji_ (herdsmen)\r\nas distinguished from their more ambitious countrymen of the towns, whom\r\ndestiny has fashioned into statesmen, diplomatists and warriors. Whatever\r\nthose beliefs may severally have been they were flung aside, and Islam\r\nstruck so deep that the Negro became in time not only as zealous, but\r\nupon occasion more zealous than his Semitic teachers. Under the fostering\r\nimpulse and care of the new religion, these backward regions, says\r\nThomson,[181] commenced an upward progress. A new and powerful bond drew\r\nthe scattered congeries of tribes together and welded them into powerful\r\ncommunities. Their moral and spiritual well-being increased by leaps and\r\nbounds, and their political and social life took an altogether higher\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n    “Islamism is in itself stationary, and was framed thus to\r\n    remain; sterile like its God, lifeless like its first principle\r\n    in all that constitutes life—for life is love, participation\r\n    and progress, and of these the Coranic deity has none. It\r\n    justly repudiates all change, all development, to borrow\r\n    the forcible words of Lord Houghton, the written book is\r\n    there the dead man’s hand, stiff and motionless; whatever\r\n    savours of vitality is by that alone convicted of heresy and\r\n    defection.”[182]\r\n\r\nThe underlying thought in the above passage is evidently comparative.\r\nThe writer is unconsciously drawing a comparison between the two great\r\nrevealed religions of the world, Christianity and Islam, as such.\r\nBut as we are here concerned merely to treat of the performances of\r\nIslam in West Africa, and of the effect upon the _Negro_, primarily\r\nof Islam, indirectly of Christianity, it can without hesitancy be\r\nasserted that what may be partly true in the description given of\r\nIslam in its relation to mankind as a whole is wholly false as regards\r\nits influence in West Africa. To the _Negro_ the God of Islam is not\r\nsterile: Islam is not lifeless. It is a living force, giving to its\r\nNegro converts, as Mr. Bosworth-Smith says, “an energy, a dignity, and\r\na self-respect which is all too rarely found in their pagan or their\r\nChristian fellow-countrymen.” Individually and collectively the Negro\r\nhas progressed since Islam crossed the desert, and just as to the Negro\r\nfetishist of the forest and the swamp religious conceptions permeate\r\nevery act, preside over every undertaking and insinuate themselves in\r\nevery incident of his daily existence, so Islam, where it has laid\r\npermanent hold upon the Negro, claims from him an allegiance entire and\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nWe need not seek for proof of this. It is writ large over West\r\nAfrica. Negroes, not by dozens or by scores, but by tens of hundreds,\r\ntraverse thousands of miles on foot from the innermost parts of the\r\nMohammedanised Continent; from Senegal, from the Niger Bend, from Bornu,\r\nfrom Hausa, from our Coast Colonies of Sierra Leone and Lagos, to perform\r\nthe Haj, the sacred journey to Mecca, which every true believer should\r\naccomplish at least once in his life. A clergyman belonging to the\r\nChurch Missionary Society, writing from Tripoli,[183] recently spoke\r\nof “a ceaseless stream of Hausa pilgrims continually passing through\r\nTripoli on the way to Mecca after a wearisome tramp across the desert,”\r\na significant admission from such a source. This “ceaseless stream” is\r\nnot confined to Hausa. It flows from all parts of Western Africa. It has\r\nflowed thus for many centuries, and the volume, far from diminishing,\r\nincreases. That is not the sign of sterility. Burton, during his stay in\r\nMecca, was witness of the extraordinary influence wielded by Islam on the\r\nNegro mind. The case, as he remarks, was not an exceptional one.\r\n\r\n    “Late in the evening,” he says, “I saw a negro in the\r\n    state called Malbus—religious frenzy. To all appearance a\r\n    Takruri,[184] he was a fine and powerful man, as the numbers\r\n    required to hold him testified. He threw his arms wildly about\r\n    him, uttering shrill cries, which sounded like _le le le le_,\r\n    and, when held, he swayed his body and waved his head from side\r\n    to side like a chained and furious elephant, straining out the\r\n    deepest groans. The Africans appear unusually subject to this\r\n    nervous state, which, seen by the ignorant and the imaginative,\r\n    would at once suggest ‘demoniacal possession.’ Either their\r\n    organisation is more impressionable or, more probably, the\r\n    hardships, privations, and fatigues endured whilst wearily\r\n    traversing inhospitable wilds and perilous seas have exalted\r\n    their imaginations to a pitch bordering upon frenzy. Often they\r\n    are seen prostrate on the pavement, or clinging to the curtain,\r\n    or rubbing their foreheads upon the stones, weeping bitterly,\r\n    and pouring forth the wildest ejaculations.”\r\n\r\nDr. Blyden, speaking of the native Moslems of Sierra Leone, has said,\r\n“Wherever they go, they take the Koran with them. In a wreck or a fire,\r\nif nothing else is saved, that book is generally rescued. They prize and\r\nhonour it with extreme reverence and devotion.... I have known them to\r\npay as high as five pounds sterling for a Manuscript Koran and think it\r\ncheap.” One might fill a volume in giving concrete instances, as well as\r\ngeneral statements founded upon the personal observations of travellers\r\nin all parts of Western Africa, to prove the inapplicability as concerns\r\nWest Africa of Palgrave’s passage quoted above, a passage which I have\r\nspecially chosen because it represents, unfortunately, what may be called\r\n“home opinion” on the subject.\r\n\r\nIt can, no doubt, be said with truth, that the majority of West African\r\nMohammedans cannot read Arabic, and that a large proportion of them\r\nonly know the ordinances of the Koran by hearsay; but this, far from\r\nbeing an argument against the influence of Islam in West Africa, is but\r\nan added proof of the grip which Islamic thought has attained over the\r\nAfrican mind, and of its having supplied the Negro—not through specific\r\nrules, regulations and ordinances, but in its main conception—with\r\nsomething which he required both in a spiritual and material sense. It\r\nis, moreover, advisable to accept with caution the general statements\r\nattributing wholesale ignorance of letters to Muslims in West Africa.\r\nBlyden gives a long list of works which he observed in a Mallam’s house\r\nin the Sierra Leone hinterland. The _Tarik_ tells us that, not long\r\nafter the introduction of Islam in West Africa, many Negroes rivalled\r\ntheir Semitic or Berber teachers in knowledge and erudition. Barth met\r\nin the wildest parts of Adamawa a Fulani from far-off Massina carrying\r\na considerable number of Arabic books as _trade_. Many other instances\r\ncould be given.\r\n\r\nIslam in West Africa is, indeed, a living force and a most powerful\r\nagency “everywhere knitting the conquerors and the conquered into an\r\nharmonious whole,”[185] and Englishmen must regard it as such. It\r\nconfronts them more particularly in its political aspect in Northern\r\nNigeria; and in Sierra Leone, the Gambia, the Gold Coast, Lagos, and to\r\na much lesser degree, in Southern Nigeria, in its social aspect. People\r\nin England appear strangely unacquainted with these facts. West African\r\nMohammedanism is presented to them in distorted shape by those who\r\nhave interest in so doing, and to whom the public ear is more readily\r\naccessible. But the local authorities in the West African Colonies\r\nrealise the state of affairs; and what is more, are rapidly coming to\r\nthe conclusion that the Mohammedan section of the community is not only\r\nthe most orderly and the most progressive, but necessitates, both as a\r\nmatter of duty and of policy, recognition on the part of the Government.\r\nWithin the last few years Mohammedan schools have been established with\r\nofficial sanction and support in all our Colonies; a mosque built by the\r\nlate Shitta Bey has been opened at Lagos[186] by the (then) Governor in\r\nperson, and in Sierra Leone a Director of Mohammedan Education has been\r\nespecially appointed at a fixed salary per annum.\r\n\r\nAs with Great Britain, so with France, but to a very much greater\r\ndegree. France’s African Empire is almost wholly an Islamic one, and\r\nconfining ourselves to that part of it which is properly West African,\r\nthe overwhelming majority of the inhabitants are Muslims. With the\r\nexception of a small section of Bobos, Diakankes and Bambarras, a larger\r\nbut declining section of the Malinkes and a few wandering Fulani in\r\nthe more remote districts of Barani, Fuladugu, Bobo-Dialassu, &c., the\r\nwhole of the Western Sudan is more or less Muslimised. In the north\r\nof her colony of Guinea, France has the large Muslim Fulani State of\r\nFuta-Jallon; in Senegal, Mohammedanism has spread right down to the\r\nocean; in the Chad region, in Baghirmi and a considerable distance up\r\nthe Shari, Islam has flourished for at least four centuries, and through\r\nFulani cattle-rearers and Hausa traders, the tenets of the Prophet are\r\nbeing propagated as far south as the Shari, Sangha and Ubanghi. The\r\nFrench have established numerous schools at which the sons of Mohammedan\r\nchiefs receive instruction on Western lines. Among such schools may be\r\nmentioned those of Kayes and Medina. Special instructors appointed by\r\nthe French Government teach Arabic side by side with French, and every\r\neffort is made by France to secure Muslim co-operation on lines of\r\nWestern thought in the great work which she has taken in hand. The French\r\nAfrican Committee go so far as to print a special bulletin in Arabic,\r\nwhich, together with the Arabic newspaper _al Mobacher_, published in\r\nAlgeria, is distributed gratuitously to a large number of influential\r\nMohammedans throughout the Western Sudan, especially in such centres as\r\nJenne, Timbuctoo, Nioro and Sokolo. Needless to say these publications\r\nare largely composed of laudatory articles calculated to inspire their\r\nreaders with the justice, generosity, and liberty of French political\r\nconceptions. The French seem to be adopting in this, as in many other\r\nrespects in West Africa, a very enlightened attitude. At the Kayes\r\nschool, for instance, they have appointed a special teacher from Algeria\r\nto superintend instruction in the Arabic tongue.[187] Moreover, in\r\norder to make clear to the Muslim population that their sons can attend\r\nthe Government schools without fear of having to listen to teaching\r\nconceived in a spirit of hostility or criticism towards Islam, the\r\nFrench authorities not only permit but encourage the presence during\r\nclass time of the Muslim schoolmasters themselves, thus removing the\r\nnatural suspicion of Muslim parents, and at the same time making allies\r\nof the “marabouts.” This line of conduct, it may be added, is especially\r\nembodied in the instructions given to all District Commissioners.\r\n\r\nHow comes it that Islam has succeeded with the West African Negro when\r\nChristianity has fared so badly? Islam has marched from triumph to\r\ntriumph among the Negroes, but of the greatest effort ever put forward\r\nby the Christian Church in West Africa, that by the Portuguese in the\r\nCongo in the sixteenth century, there remains little or no trace, and the\r\nresults of more widespread but less consistent (because rent by internal\r\ndifferences) efforts of to-day cannot be termed otherwise than profoundly\r\ndiscouraging, when one considers the lives expended in a fruitless task;\r\npitifully sterile, when one is aware of the large sums that have been,\r\nand continue to be, spent in the attempt. It would seem as though the\r\nfailure of the Christian Church in North Africa, and the failure of Roman\r\nCatholicism in South West Africa, in the sixteenth century, were to be\r\nrepeated in these later days by the multifarious sects and denominations\r\nthe monotony of whose painful struggles to gain a foothold on the western\r\nshores of the unfathomable continent is only varied by the jealousies and\r\nrecriminations which they indulge in towards one another.\r\n\r\nThe Protestant churchman is wont to ascribe the failure of Christian\r\npropaganda in South-Western Africa in the sixteenth century to Roman\r\nCatholicism, which to him is the embodiment of an evil little if at all\r\nremoved from the evil of Islamic doctrine.[188] I have heard English\r\nand French Roman Catholics attribute it to the inherent incapacity, or\r\nweakness, or corruptibility—according to the particular views of the\r\nindividual—of the would-be converters, the Portuguese. Persons devoid of\r\nspecial religious prejudices are sometimes inclined to argue that the\r\nmere fact of the slave trade being in existence contemporaneously was in\r\nitself sufficient to account for it. Upon examination none of these views\r\nappear very conclusive. Protestantism has not fared better in West Africa\r\nthan Roman Catholicism. Indeed, it may be doubted whether it has fared,\r\non the whole, quite as well. No argument worthy of serious attention has\r\nbeen adduced to prove the exceptional unfitness of Portuguese prelates to\r\nsuccessfully accomplish the task they had begun, nor does the decline\r\nof the political influence of Portugal in West Africa provide a fitting\r\nexplanation, because the flimsy nature of the first apparent successes\r\nof the Roman Catholic Church had become evident before that decline took\r\nplace. As for the alleged slave-trade deterrent, it was, contradictory as\r\nthe statement may appear, probably no deterrent at all, but rather the\r\nreverse; for the policy of the Portuguese consisted in promoting friendly\r\nrelations with the more powerful potentates of the littoral, and in\r\nsupplying them with guns and gunpowder to make war on the inland tribes.\r\nThe latter, and not the coastwise natives, were, in the main, the chief\r\nsufferers by the slave trade; and the coast people, being guaranteed from\r\nmolestation, would have no occasion to invoke the miseries inflicted upon\r\nthem by the Portuguese traffickers in human flesh, when approached by the\r\nPortuguese inculcators of Christianity. In fact, if the political acts\r\nof professing Christian nations in West Africa are to be considered as a\r\nfactor in the measure of success, or failure of Christian propagandism\r\nin West Africa—a debatable proposition upon which I propose to refer\r\nlater on—it may without hesitation be affirmed that recent developments\r\nof European policy have done more to prejudice the natives against the\r\ndoctrines of Christianity, as propounded by European teachers, than the\r\nslave trade with all its savagery and horrors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SUSU MALLAM]\r\n\r\nWe must go deeper than this, and in doing so try and clear our minds\r\nof preconceived opinions, no easy matter when certain errors have\r\nbeen so persistently dinned into our ears that they have come to be\r\nregarded as cardinal articles of faith; and those who in this respect\r\noccasionally venture to disturb the serenity of our convictions are\r\nlooked upon as outside the pale of respectable society. One of such\r\npreconceived opinions is embodied in the quotation from Palgrave’s\r\n“Arabia” already commented upon. Another bears on the nature of Islamic\r\nproselytism in West Africa. It is an ingrained belief with most people\r\nthat Mohammedanism in West Africa has ever been propagated by brute\r\nforce; is ever and always associated with “slave-raiding.” The mere\r\nepithet of “slave-raiders” applied in Reuter’s telegrams to a tribe\r\nwith whom trouble has occurred, is sufficient to justify in the eyes\r\nof the public any expeditions of a punitive kind which the authorities\r\nin their wisdom think fit to organise, against those who have incurred\r\nthe displeasure of a District Commissioner or Military Commandant. Far\r\nbe it from me to assert that occasions do not arise when the adoption\r\nof punitive undertakings is not only an unavoidable necessity, but a\r\npositive duty owed by the Suzerain Power to its protected subjects. But\r\nI would venture respectfully to suggest that the term “slave-raiding” is\r\nmuch abused, not a little distorted, and sometimes most unfairly applied.\r\nIt is used almost exclusively in connection with Mohammedan tribes. When\r\na difference comes about with pagans, we are told that it is caused by a\r\npredilection to human sacrifices. A reference to the frequent collisions\r\nwhich have taken place between Great Britain and the natives of Western\r\nAfrica during the last six years will show that, either as a primary or\r\nan accessory cause of the difficulty, human sacrifices are invariably\r\ngiven in the case of a pagan community and slave-raiding in the case of a\r\nMohammedan community.\r\n\r\nThere could be no greater error than the prevalent idea that in West\r\nAfrica, Islam has attained its remarkable successes _manu militari_. Most\r\nof Islam’s triumphs in West Africa have been won by the peaceful sect\r\nof the Quadriyah, founded by Sidi-Abd-el-Kader-el-Jieari in 1077 A.D.,\r\nfirst introduced into West Africa in the fifteenth century; and the work\r\naccomplished by this sect has been more enduring and more widespread\r\nthan that of the other great order in West Africa, the Tijaniyah, which\r\nbelieves primarily in the sword as a means of conversion.\r\n\r\n    “In the beginning[189] of the present century[190] the great\r\n    revival which was so profoundly influencing the Mohammedan\r\n    world stirred up the Quadriyah of the Sahara and Western\r\n    Sudan to renewed life and energy, and before long learned\r\n    theologians or small colonies of persons affiliated to the\r\n    order were to be found, scattered throughout the Sudan,\r\n    on the mountain chain that runs along the coast of Guinea,\r\n    and even to the west of it, in the Free State of Liberia.\r\n    These initiates formed centres of Islamic influence in the\r\n    midst of the pagan population, among whom they received a\r\n    welcome as public scribes, legists, writers of amulets, and\r\n    schoolmasters; gradually they would acquire influence over\r\n    their new surroundings, and isolated cases of conversion would\r\n    soon grow into a little band of converts, the most promising\r\n    of whom would often be sent to complete their studies at the\r\n    chief centre of the order; here they might remain for several\r\n    years, until they had perfected their theological studies, and\r\n    would then return to their native place, fully equipped for the\r\n    work of spreading the faith among their fellow-countrymen. In\r\n    this way a leaven has been introduced into the midst of fetish\r\n    worshippers and idolaters which has gradually spread the faith\r\n    of Islam surely and steadily, though by almost imperceptible\r\n    degrees. Up to the middle of the present century[191] in the\r\n    Sudan, schools were founded and conducted by teachers trained\r\n    under the auspices of the Quadriyah, and their organisation\r\n    provided for a regular and continued system of propaganda among\r\n    the heathen tribes. The missionary work of this order has been\r\n    entirely of a peaceful character, and has relied wholly upon\r\n    personal example and precept, on the influence of a teacher\r\n    over his pupils, and the spread of education.”\r\n\r\nThe Quadriyah order, moreover, is not animated by hostility towards\r\nChristians, in which it differs materially from that of the Tijaniyah.\r\nThe French find it advisable to co-operate politically with the former\r\nsect. “It is,” writes Captain Morrison in the interesting report already\r\nalluded to, “our business to see that the Negroes, Moors, Tuaregs and\r\nother inhabitants of the Western Sudan should become more affiliated to\r\nthe Quadriyah (Kadria). It is, thanks to the spirit with which the Imam\r\nof Lanfiera inspires his adepts, that friendship and protection have been\r\ngranted to all our explorers in that region.” M. le Commandant Binger\r\nthus describes the work of Quadriyah Muslims in the important city and\r\ncountry of Kong, in the hinterland of the Ivory Coast, which he was the\r\nfirst to discover and bring to the notice of Europe:\r\n\r\n    “A hundred years ago, the influence of the Muslim community of\r\n    Kong did not extend beyond a few miles of the city. Surrounded\r\n    on all sides by pagan tribes who existed by rapine and\r\n    brigandage, the people of Kong could not carry on trade and\r\n    dispose of their cotton goods without great loss, consequent\r\n    upon the exorbitant taxes imposed by the pagan kinglets,\r\n    non-payment of which involved the pillage of caravans. What did\r\n    the Muslims do? They established Mohammedan families from Kong\r\n    in all the villages situated between Kong and Bobo-Dialassu\r\n    first, and between Kong and Jenne afterwards. It took them\r\n    fifty years to settle one or two families in each village.\r\n    Each of these immigrants organised a school, asked some of\r\n    the inhabitants to send their children there, then little by\r\n    little, through their relations with Kong and other commercial\r\n    centres, they were able to render service to the pagan king of\r\n    the country, to gain his confidence, and gradually to take part\r\n    in his affairs. If a difficulty arises it is always a Muslim\r\n    who is appealed to. Even if he be quite alone in the country,\r\n    the king will empower him to negotiate, because he is usually\r\n    able to read and write and has the reputation of being a good\r\n    and holy man. If the Muslim ambassador fails in his mission, he\r\n    proposes to the pagan king that the mediation of the people of\r\n    Kong shall be invoked. Thus the country becomes placed under\r\n    the protection of the Mohammedan States of Kong. Gradually\r\n    Islam makes progress. More Muslim families settle among the\r\n    pagans, who do not fail to become converts. The latter quickly\r\n    recognise that the one means of finding aid and protection\r\n    wherever their travels may lead them lies in the adoption of\r\n    Islam.[192] Moreover, have not the pagans a significant example\r\n    before them? Do not the Muslims live in comparative ease and\r\n    comfort? The pagan, while acknowledging that it is commerce and\r\n    industry that render Mohammedans prosperous, attributes much\r\n    of that prosperity to the Supreme Being, and the Muslim takes\r\n    care to point the moral, ‘God wills it thus.’ It is clearly\r\n    apparent from the above that the Islamic propaganda of Kong is\r\n    carried on by persuasion. Force is but rarely employed, and\r\n    only against pagan peoples composed of thieves and brigands,\r\n    and when the Kong Mussulmans are driven to make use of it.”[193]\r\n\r\nThe practices of the Kong people in this respect are not at all peculiar\r\nto themselves. We find the same procedure mentioned by Thomson, Barth,\r\nand numerous other explorers; and the influence of Islam among the Hausas\r\ncould never have been maintained if to the early conquests of Othman\r\nFodio had not succeeded the peaceful efforts of the Muslim teacher,\r\nschoolmaster and priest. Dr. Blyden once described to the writer the\r\nincidents relating to the conversion of one of the largest pagan towns in\r\nthe Sierra Leone hinterland, the knowledge of which he gleaned from the\r\ninhabitants themselves in the course of his travels in the Protectorate.\r\nOn a certain day the inhabitants of the town observed a man, black like\r\nthemselves, but clad in a white garment, advancing down the main street.\r\nSuddenly the stranger prostrated himself and prayed to Allah. The natives\r\nstoned him and he departed. In a little while he returned, and prostrated\r\nhimself as before. This time he was not stoned, but the people gathered\r\nabout him with mockery and reviling. The men spat upon him and the women\r\nhurled insults and abuse. His prayer ended, the stranger went away in\r\nsilence, grave and austere, seemingly oblivious to his unsympathetic\r\nsurroundings. For a space he did not renew his visit, and in the interval\r\nthe people began to regret their rudeness. The demeanour of the stranger\r\nunder trying circumstances had gained their respect. A third time he\r\ncame, and with him two boys also clothed in white garments. Together they\r\nknelt and offered prayer. The natives watched, and forbore to jeer. At\r\nthe conclusion of the prayer a woman came timidly forward and pushed her\r\nyoung son towards the holy man, then as rapidly retreated. The Muslim\r\nrose, took the boy by the hand and, followed by his acolytes, left the\r\nvillage in silence as before. When he came again he was accompanied by\r\nthree boys, two of them those who had been with him before, and the third\r\nthe woman’s son, clad like the rest. All four fell upon their knees,\r\nthe holy man reciting the prayer in a voice that spoke of triumph and\r\nsuccess. He never left the town again, for the people crowded round\r\nhim beseeching him to teach their children. In a short time the entire\r\npopulation of that town, which for three centuries had beaten back the\r\nassaults of would-be Muslim converters by the sword, had voluntarily\r\nembraced Islam!\r\n\r\nIt is in incidents such as these, which are by no means rare in West\r\nAfrica, that the moral force of Islam lies, and which is largely\r\naccountable for its astonishing successes. The fanatical zeal of an\r\nAhmadu, a Samory and an El-Haji-Omar are but drops in the ocean compared\r\nwith the systematic moral suasion exercised by Islamic teachers, who,\r\ncarrying no staff or scrip, relying solely upon the inward strength\r\nderived from contact with a higher creed, brave the perils and\r\ndiscomforts incidental to their calling with a sublime indifference only\r\nmet with in Biblical narrative. There is a passage in Arnold’s “The\r\nPreaching of Islam” which accurately interprets the misconceptions which\r\nexist on the subject of Islamic propaganda in West Africa:\r\n\r\n    “Unfortunately,” says that author, “for a true estimate of the\r\n    missionary work of Islam in Western Africa, the fame of the\r\n    _jihads_, or religious wars, has thrown into the shade the\r\n    successes of the peaceful propagandist, though the labours of\r\n    the latter have been more effectual to the spread of Islam\r\n    than the creation of petty short-lived dynasties. The records\r\n    of campaigns, especially when they have interfered with the\r\n    commercial projects or schemes of conquest of the white man,\r\n    have naturally attracted the attention of Europeans more\r\n    than the unobtrusive labours of the Mohammedan preacher and\r\n    schoolmaster.... These _jihads_, rightly looked upon, are but\r\n    incidents in the modern Islamic revival, and are by no means\r\n    characteristic of the forces and activities that have been\r\n    really operative in the promulgation of Islam in West Africa;\r\n    indeed, unless followed up by distinctly missionary efforts,\r\n    they would have proved almost wholly ineffectual in the\r\n    creation of a true Muslim community.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nISLAM IN WEST AFRICA\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing now perhaps in a somewhat more open frame of mind with regard to\r\nthe work of Islam in West Africa, we may attempt to investigate the\r\nmethods of Islam and the methods of Christianity in their relationship to\r\nthe Negro. In this manner we may hope to come to still closer quarters\r\nwith the subject, and by so doing arrive at a tolerably clear impression\r\nof its various phases. Why does Africa, which was, as has been truly\r\nsaid, “the nursing mother of Christianity,” remain impervious to the\r\nteachings of the highest religion? Why does Christianity, which has\r\nlaboured for so many centuries in Western Africa, make no appreciable\r\nadvance in that country? The failure may, I think, be ascribed to four\r\nmain causes: first, the refusal to admit that the circumstances which\r\nregulate certain natural laws vary with climatic considerations and\r\nracial idiosyncrasies; secondly, the tendency which Christianity, as\r\ntaught in West Africa, has to denationalise; thirdly, the incompatibility\r\nbetween the ideals of Christ and modern conceptions of Christianity;\r\nfourthly, the political action of Christian Powers.\r\n\r\nFor obvious reasons the question of polygamy is a very difficult one\r\nto publicly discuss, but the subject of Christianity and Mohammedanism\r\nin Western Africa cannot adequately be treated without referring to\r\nit. It is no use shutting our eyes to the fact that the refusal of the\r\nChristian Church to admit polygamists into its fold is one of the great\r\nobstacles with which the Church in West Africa has to contend. That is\r\nnot seriously disputed, and yet, so far as can be observed, the chief\r\ndignitaries of the Church with whom all decisions affecting missionary\r\nenterprise in West Africa must ultimately lie, give no sign that they\r\nrealise the paramount importance of the problem. Now and again individual\r\nutterances are made, which tend to show that some Churchmen, at least,\r\nare possessed of a spirit sufficiently broad to approach the subject in\r\nmore practical fashion. A well-known Canon of the Church once remarked\r\nthat, “owing to polygamy, Mohammedan countries are free from professional\r\noutcasts, a greater reproach to Christianity than polygamy to Islam.”\r\nAlthough the first part of that statement may not be accepted _ad\r\nliteratim_, there are, unfortunately, sufficient data to show that the\r\nmorals of Mohammedan communities in West Africa are higher than those of\r\nthe Europeanised West Coast towns, where alone Christianity has gained a\r\nsort of foothold, and where a monogamous Christianity has been preached\r\noff and on for centuries past. And it is, at any rate, true that in West\r\nAfrica the Mohammedan is, as a rule, distinctly averse to relationship\r\nwith public women; and also, as a rule, jealously guards the honour of\r\nhis wives and daughters.\r\n\r\nLet us consider for a moment how this refusal on the part of the Church\r\nto receive polygamists appeals to the Negro in relation to Christianity.\r\nIf there is one social feature of the Negro which all observers are\r\nagreed in recognising, it is the sincerity and depth of the link between\r\nmother and son.[194] With what sort of feelings, then, must the Negro\r\nlook upon a religion which, according to its expounders, brands his\r\nparents with immorality? In very truth, whether we approach this great\r\nsubject from a standpoint of common sense and severe practicability,\r\nor whether we claim to study it on moral grounds alone, only one\r\nconclusion can be arrived at. To offer Christianity to the Negro at\r\nthe price of repudiating the members of his household is unreasonable,\r\npreposterous, unjust, and even cruel. It is unreasonable, insomuch as\r\nit ignores the most fundamental laws of human affection which exist in\r\nmore or less developed form in every community and under every clime.\r\nIt is preposterous, because it displays an extraordinary ignorance\r\nof the customs of the Negro and the strength of the family tie, and\r\nall that appertains to it among the Negroes. It is unjust, because it\r\nwould deprive the rejected women (and children) of all they possess,\r\ncover them with shame and obloquy, thus deliberately inciting them to\r\nlead immoral lives. It is cruel, because, with an entire inconsequence\r\nand heedlessness of after effects, it would break up a social system\r\nconsecrated by immemorial usage. There is a noble passage in Faidherbe’s\r\ngreat work which I cannot refrain from quoting in this connection:\r\n\r\n    “Certain people,” said that distinguished Frenchman, “would\r\n    seem to desire that the natives should be induced to repudiate\r\n    their wives and to retain but one. This method appears to me\r\n    to be thoroughly immoral. What! Our object is to strengthen\r\n    family ties, and we would begin by disorganising the family! We\r\n    should commit a great injustice, and we should be displaying\r\n    a singular callousness towards the women and children, if we\r\n    professed to grant to the native the title and privileges of a\r\n    citizen on the condition that he kept one wife and expelled the\r\n    others. We should place venerable fathers of families in the\r\n    position of sending away, with their children, wives with whom\r\n    they had lived for fifteen, twenty, or thirty years. And how\r\n    would they distinguish between their wives?... Disorganisation\r\n    would be complete.”[195]\r\n\r\nThere is another aspect of the question which cannot fail to arrest the\r\nattention of all enlightened and truly Christian men. Is polygamy a\r\nnecessary institution on physical grounds for the Negro _in Africa_? The\r\nevidence in a corroborative sense is not to be lightly dismissed. Without\r\nstopping to discuss the generally admitted theory that the sexual side of\r\nman’s nature becomes more pronounced as the tropical zone is approached,\r\nit is incontestable that a well-grounded belief exists in West African\r\neducated native circles that the effects of monogamy upon the Negro _are\r\nracially destructive_. Dr. Blyden’s testimony in this respect may not,\r\nperhaps, command universal acknowledgment, but the following passage\r\nfrom his writings is well worthy of note:\r\n\r\n    “Owing,” he says, “to the exhausting climatic conditions, the\r\n    life and perpetuity of the population depend upon polygamy.\r\n    The difference is marked between children born under monogamic\r\n    restrictions and those whose parents are polygamists. In the\r\n    one there is the evidence of physical deterioration and mental\r\n    weakness; in the other are manifest physical vigour and mental\r\n    activity and alertness. In the one there is the sad evidence\r\n    of arrested growth, suppressed physical development, and\r\n    intellectual sluggishness; in the other there is astonishing\r\n    muscular strength and fully developed chest—a reproduction of\r\n    their fathers’—not weaker, but wiser than their fathers’, when\r\n    not diverted from aboriginal simplicity by alien influence.”\r\n\r\nThe exhausting climatic conditions of which Doctor Blyden speaks is\r\naccountable for a custom, almost universal throughout West Africa, among\r\nboth Mohammedans and pagans; which, although it may have some drawbacks\r\nattaching to it, must nevertheless be assumed to entail preponderating\r\nadvantages for the racial welfare of the people, or it would hardly have\r\nbeen so widely adopted. I refer, of course, to the extensive period of\r\nlactation—three years as a rule—during which time husband and wife have\r\nno connection; connection, indeed, generally ceasing when conception has\r\ntaken place. The custom is attributive to the belief that too frequent\r\nchild-bearing is injurious to the health of the mother and the offspring,\r\nin view of the climate.[196] This is a point which also deserves the\r\nmost attentive consideration. The instinct of primitive peoples in such\r\nmatters is generally found to be based upon knowledge born of experience.\r\nThe only portion of the Dark Continent where orthodox Christianity has\r\nmade any appreciable inroad is Uganda. Now what does Sir Harry Johnston\r\ntell us in his last report? He says there is a serious decrease in the\r\nbirth-rate of the Bantu Waganda. He quotes Monseigneur Strachir’s opinion\r\nthat one of the causes of this state of affairs is the introduction of\r\nmonogamy, consequent upon the spread of the Christian faith.\r\n\r\n    “In many parts of West Africa,” continues Sir Harry Johnston,\r\n    “where Christianity prevails, but where there is very little\r\n    result other than pious utterances from the mouth, ostensible\r\n    monogamy is corrected by the possession of recognised or\r\n    unrecognised concubines, and by a general promiscuousness in\r\n    sexual matters. But in Uganda, Christianity seems to have taken\r\n    such a real hold upon the people that, though by no means free\r\n    from immorality—as no nation or community is free from the same\r\n    tendency—they really seem to be striving at genuine monogamy\r\n    and the exclusive possession of one wife for a partner. As the\r\n    Baganda women are certainly very poor breeders, this means that\r\n    the majority of couples only have one child. In fact, the birth\r\n    of a second child on the part of the wife is such an unusual\r\n    occurrence that the wife, in consequence thereof, is given a\r\n    new and honorific title.”\r\n\r\nA Liberian Bishop—one of the kindliest of men—to whom I showed the\r\nabove passage, replied sententiously that the ways of the Almighty were\r\nunfathomable, but that the disappearance of the few could not be held to\r\nweigh in the balance as compared with the salvation of the many; which\r\nseemed to me to bear a curious analogy to that passage in “Azurara”\r\nin which the old Portuguese historian, apostrophising Prince Henry\r\nthe Navigator on the occasion of the first appearance at his court of\r\nWest African slaves, torn with every accompaniment of barbarity from\r\ntheir homes by those gallant knights Antam Gonçalvez and Nuno Tristram,\r\nexclaims:\r\n\r\n    “O holy Prince, peradventure thy pleasure and delight might\r\n    have some semblance of covetousness at receiving the knowledge\r\n    of such a sum of riches, even as great as those thou didst\r\n    expend to arrive at that result?... But thy joy was solely\r\n    from that one holy purpose of thine to seek salvation for the\r\n    lost souls of the heathen. And in the light of this it seemed\r\n    to thee, when thou sawest those captives brought into thy\r\n    presence, that the expense and trouble thou hadst undergone\r\n    was nothing: such was thy pleasure at beholding them. And yet\r\n    the greater benefit was theirs, for though their bodies were\r\n    now brought into some subjection, that was a small matter in\r\n    comparison with their souls, which would now possess true\r\n    freedom for evermore.”\r\n\r\nI hope it will not be thought that these references are made with any\r\nidea of depreciating the efforts, and in some respects surprisingly\r\nsuccessful efforts, of Christian propaganda among the Bantu races of the\r\nUganda Protectorate. The point under discussion is not the evangelising\r\nsuccess of the Church in Uganda, but the physical effects of a monogamous\r\nChristianity upon the races of Africa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FULANI MALLAM]\r\n\r\nI have been at great pains to obtain all the evidence available bearing\r\ndirectly or indirectly on this subject, and in the aggregate it bears out\r\nwhat precedes. The highest type of the Christian educated Negro urges\r\nthat an entire latitude should be left to the aboriginal element in the\r\nmatter, and although professing monogamists themselves, they strictly\r\nmaintain—whether rightly or wrongly is not for the layman to decide—that\r\nin so doing the Church would not be acting contrary to the principles of\r\ndivine revelation.[197]\r\n\r\nI have given as the second contributory cause of the non-success of\r\nChristian missions in West Africa the tendency to denationalisation.\r\nIt is unhappily true that the Christianised Negro becomes to a large\r\nextent denationalised, and the reason of it lies in the methods employed\r\nto convert him. Islam, on the other hand, not only encourages the\r\nspirit of nationality in the African, but intensifies it. The Muslim\r\nNegro is elevated among his pagan neighbours; he gains their respect\r\nand increases his own. Islam takes the Negro by the hand and gives him\r\nequality with all men. From the day the pagan adopts Islam, no Semite\r\nMuslim can claim racial superiority over him. Islam to the Negro is the\r\nstepping-stone to a higher conception of existence, inspiring in his\r\nbreast confidence in his own destiny, imbuing his spirit with a robust\r\nfaith in himself and in his race. Christianity does not do this for the\r\nNegro. Its effect, indeed, is quite contrary. Instead of encouraging, it\r\ndiscourages. Instead of inculcating a greater self-reliance, it seems\r\nto lessen that which exists. The Christian Negro for the most part is\r\na sort of hybrid. He is neither one thing nor another. His adoption of\r\nEuropean clothes causes him to be looked upon partly with suspicion,\r\npartly with ridicule, by his pagan fellow-countrymen; although they make\r\nuse of his services as clerk or secretary when occasion requires it.\r\nMohammedans treat him with undisguised contempt. More bitter perhaps\r\nthan anything else is the scorn which Europeans themselves bestow upon\r\nhim. Question any white official, military man, trader or traveller, as\r\nto his impressions of the West African native. He will tell you that the\r\npagan native of the interior is more often than not a fine fellow, one\r\nof nature’s gentlemen, hospitable, kindly, simple, courteous; that the\r\nMohammedan native is a splendid man, with a carriage full of pride and\r\nself-reliance, arrogant may be, haughty, but singularly dignified, with\r\na conscious superiority and quiet confidence stamped all over him. But\r\nthe Christian Negro is seldom spoken of without opprobrium. His vanity,\r\nhis conceit, his “veneer of civilisation,” the vices he has acquired and\r\nso forth, are the inevitable theme. His unfortunate habit of adopting\r\nthe latest vagaries of European fashions, both in his own person and in\r\nthe person of his women folk, is the butt of constant sarcasm, as are\r\nthe accounts of the solemnisation of the Christian form of marriage in\r\na native West Coast town. Even the missionaries are compelled, although\r\nwith natural unwillingness, to admit an unpalatable fact. “There are a\r\ngreat many natives on the coast and in Lower Nigeria,” writes Canon\r\nRobinson, “who call themselves Christian; there are distressingly\r\nfew converts.... My advice to travellers on the coast in search of\r\ntrustworthy servants would be to prefer the heathen or Mohammedan to the\r\nprofessing Christian, because a bad religion sincerely accepted, or even\r\nno religion at all, is to be preferred to a religious profession which\r\nis only a sham.” A humiliating confession, humiliating to the Christian\r\nChurch, humiliating to European civilisation. What between one thing\r\nand another, the Christianised Negro is a _déclassé_, a _culotté sans\r\nculottes_.[198] Of course there are exceptions, but they are relatively\r\nscarce, and consist in the main of natives who have acquired wealth by\r\ncommerce (wealth being a safeguard to open obloquy all the world over, no\r\nmatter what the colour of the possessor’s skin), and who either through\r\nthe enjoyment of special educational advantages, or because they are men\r\nof unusually high character and intelligence naturally, have succeeded\r\nin grasping the true Christian ideal and have gained moral and spiritual\r\nennoblement thereby. It is my privilege to number such a man among my\r\nfriends. But I greatly doubt whether he would feel at ease in travelling\r\nor sojourning alone in the interior, even among the tribe to which he\r\nbelongs, in his own country of origin. There seems to be a barrier\r\nbetween the Christianised Negro and his non-Christian countrymen; a\r\nbarrier which excludes sympathy, and which European policy tends to still\r\nfurther accentuate.\r\n\r\nTo what are these things due? To no one particular circumstance, but to\r\na whole set of circumstances, which together produce the effect. To the\r\ngeneral, omnipresent suggestion—possibly quite unintentioned in many\r\ncases—of the Negro’s inherent racial inferiority, inculcated by European\r\nmissionaries. To the never absent, one might say inevitable insistence,\r\nwhether outspoken or only understood, upon a great intellectual, social,\r\nmoral gulf which yawns between the Negro and his Caucasian instructor; a\r\ngulf that can never be bridged by Christianity, as taught in West Africa\r\nby Europeans.\r\n\r\nThe third and fourth contributory causes, viz. incompatibility between\r\nthe ideals of Christ and the modern conceptions of Christianity, and\r\nthe political action of Christian Powers, may be treated together, for\r\nthey are closely allied one to the other; as, indeed, they also are to\r\nthe third cause, upon which I have briefly touched. There is a striking\r\npassage in the last literary contribution on West African affairs,\r\npenned by Miss Kingsley on that fatal voyage to the Cape, which puts in\r\nmore pregnant language than I could hope to do the underlying thought\r\nexpressed above:\r\n\r\n    “I know,” wrote Miss Kingsley, “that there is a general opinion\r\n    among the leading men of both races that Christianity will\r\n    give the one possible solution to the whole problem. I fail to\r\n    be able to believe this. I fail to believe Christianity will\r\n    bring peace between the two races, for the simple reason that,\r\n    though it may be possible to convert Africans _en masse_ into\r\n    practical Christians, it is quite impossible to convert the\r\n    Europeans _en masse_ to it. You have only got to look at the\r\n    history of any European nation—the Dutch, the Spanish, the\r\n    Italian, the German—every one calling themselves Christian, but\r\n    none the more for that tolerant and peaceable. Each one of them\r\n    is ready to take out a patent for a road to heaven, and make\r\n    that road out of men’s blood and bones and the ashes of burnt\r\n    homesteads. Of course, by doing this they are not following the\r\n    true teachings of Jesus Christ, but that has not, and will not,\r\n    become a factor in politics.”\r\n\r\nThe bewildering contradictions between the ideals laid down by Christ,\r\nas taught by the expounders of his word, and the practical effect of\r\nthat teaching as exemplified in the conduct of Europeans and European\r\nGovernments, confronts the Negro at every turn. The more intelligent he\r\nis, the more advanced in the social scale, the more puzzling does it\r\nbecome. Is it a question of charity? The Muslim propagandist speaks of\r\nChrist with deep respect amounting to reverence. He is _Kalima_—the Word;\r\n_Masih_—the Messiah; _Qual-ul-Haqq_—the Word of Truth; _Ruh_—the Spirit\r\n(of God). He is “One illustrious in this world and in the next”: “One who\r\nhas near access to God.” The Christian missionary speaks of Mohammed “as\r\nan impostor;” “an arch impostor;” “a man full of evil and wickedness.”\r\nIslam is a “bad religion”: “its ways are the ways of darkness”: “it is\r\nSatan’s work,” and so on. Is it a question of self-abnegation? The Bible\r\nand the Koran utter the same precepts in almost identical terms. But what\r\na difference in the spiritual practice of their respective expounders\r\nin West Africa! The Muslim preacher follows out the letter of his book.\r\nHe goes on his way alone and unattended, carrying neither purse nor\r\nscrip. He lives the life of the Negro, enters into his pursuits, shares\r\nhis hardships and his pleasures, assimilates himself in every possible\r\nway with those whom he hopes to convert. The European missionary is\r\ncompelled, by the exigencies of the climate very greatly, to attend\r\nprimarily to his own comforts. He travels with a long file of carriers\r\nbearing his baggage; preserved foods, linen, camp impedimenta and what\r\nnot. Some of the most earnest missionaries keenly realise the drawbacks\r\nwhich such procedure must entail in the prosecution of their work, both\r\nphysically and morally. They are deeply sensible of the adverse influence\r\nwhich it cannot fail to exercise over their labours. We have seen an\r\nEnglish prelate, high up in the hierarchy of his Church, suggest a\r\ndecrease in his salary, in order that the balance might be devoted to the\r\nappointment of another helper in the great cause.[199] On the other hand,\r\nwe find in the works and letters of prominent missionaries engaged in the\r\nWest African field, egotistical essays of the following description:\r\n“Care must be taken that the waterproof cloak is _stitched_. Sponges,\r\nbath-towels, &c., will suggest themselves. Do not forget the table-linen;\r\na neatly arranged table helps to tempt the appetite, which is often\r\nfastidious. Antibilious compounds are worth in my judgment _two guineas_\r\na box.” The above passage is derived from a book recently published,\r\nwritten by a missionary with nine years’ experience in West Africa. The\r\narticles mentioned by the writer are recommended by him as indispensable\r\nto the welfare of a teacher of the Gospel in West Africa. The following\r\nis a typical passage culled from the epistolary effusions published from\r\ntime to time in the organ of the Church Missionary Society from the pen\r\nof a most energetic Bishop, who has been endeavouring with singular\r\nill-success, and not without some danger of arousing disturbances, to\r\nevangelise the Hausas. “We are all well.... Our appetites are enormous.\r\nWe have plenty of food. We receive presents of food from the people every\r\nday—rice, onions, corn, maize, fowls, bananas, &c. B—— shoots a good many\r\npartridges and guinea-fowl, and we have a good reserve of European and\r\nEnglish stores.” That these little peculiarities do not in the slightest\r\ndegree detract from the sincerity of the writers may be accepted without\r\nreserve. All we are here concerned with, is to consider the general\r\neffect which these conceptions of the methods of propagating Christianity\r\nin West Africa are likely to have upon the African. Are men who profess\r\nso tender a regard for their well-being calculated to make much headway\r\nin an evangelical sense? It may reasonably be doubted.\r\n\r\nIs it a question of vice? The Mohammedan preacher does not leave a\r\nstone unturned to combat drunkenness in every form, and to a very\r\nlarge extent he succeeds. The sobriety of the great mass of Muslimised\r\nNegroes no longer requires to be demonstrated. Laxity in this respect\r\nis the exception which proves the rule. The European missionary also\r\ndenounces drunkenness, and with a fervour at times which is not always\r\ndiscriminating. But he is terribly handicapped (1) by the European\r\ntrader, about one-fifth of whose total trade consists in the importation\r\nof freshly distilled liquor, often but not invariably containing various\r\nimpurities, and in quality not exceeding that which is sold in low\r\npublic-houses in this country, and which freely mixed with water may\r\nnot be very injurious, but drunk neat, as for the most part it is, in\r\nthe _coastal_ regions of West Africa, is—we have overwhelming testimony\r\nto that effect—harmful;[200] (2) by the European Governments who,\r\nalthough they do now and again raise the duty on spirits in deference to\r\npublic opinion, tacitly encourage a traffic without which their whole\r\nadministrative machinery would become temporarily paralysed, seeing\r\nthat from 45 per cent. to 75 per cent. of the revenue of their Colonies\r\nis derived from this traffic. These circumstances may, or may not, be\r\npreventable. They exist, and cannot be ignored. As for another kind of\r\nvice; the life lived by many white men in West Africa is not, perhaps,\r\ncalculated to give the Negro a high idea of the morality of Christian\r\nEurope. His occasional visits to Europeanised coast towns—presuming him\r\nto be living some distance in the interior—do not probably imbue him\r\nwith the notion that his trousered countrymen are the gainers in moral\r\nethics, through contact with European civilisation; nor, unhappily, can\r\nit be said that the tales and personal experiences related by those of\r\nhis educated brothers who visit our great cities are of a kind to lessen\r\nthe impression he may already have formed as to the results of twenty\r\ncenturies of Christianity in Europe.[201]\r\n\r\nIs it a question of gauging the true inwardness of the doctrine of peace\r\nand love? It is to be feared that the political aims of European Powers\r\nin West Africa are too often associated with Maxims and Martinis to\r\nadmit of much doubt on that score. The Negro is a shrewd man, and he\r\ndistinguishes professions from actions. The readiness with which the\r\nwhite interlopers in his country appeal to the sword as the shortest cut\r\nto the solution of a misunderstanding is instructive. The hastiness with\r\nwhich his habits and customs are trampled upon by his would-be elevators;\r\nthe cheerful alacrity he is expected to show in swallowing innovations\r\nthrust upon him at what, to his conservative prejudices, appear to him a\r\nmoment’s notice; and, finally, the increasing desire on the part of his\r\nEuropean friends to appropriate his most precious heritage, his ancestral\r\nlands, and the fruits thereof, for their own use—all these things,\r\nwhether in fashionable parlance they be the “inevitable” accompaniments\r\nof opening up West Africa by Western Europe or not, constitute those\r\ncontradictions of which I have already spoken, and whatever else they\r\nmay do, militate against the spread of Christianity in the land of the\r\nNegroes.\r\n\r\nIs there a remedy, and if so, on what lines is it to be sought for?\r\nThere is only one _native_ Christian State in Africa—Abyssinia—and its\r\nChristianity is declared by eminent divines to be tainted with all\r\nsorts of heresies and objections. But it has endowed Abyssinia with\r\nsufficient vitality to enable her to repel Mohammedan invasion for a\r\nlong term of centuries, and the strong religious zeal of Abyssinia’s\r\nwarriors was not a negligible factor in beating back the unjustifiable\r\naggression made upon the independence of that country by Italy. To-day\r\nthe Emperor of this African Christian State is, with one exception,\r\nprobably the most powerful native ruler in the world. No doubt, it does\r\nnot enter the heads of European statesmen to encourage the growth of a\r\nsimilar State in West Africa; which, indeed, is an obvious impossibility\r\nfor many reasons. Yet Abyssinia provides a moral for the Christian\r\nChurch. The Christianity of Abyssinia is an _African_ Christianity,\r\noriginally taught by an _African_, perpetuated by _Africans_. Orthodox\r\nor unorthodox, it has shown itself suitable to the necessities and the\r\nrequirements of Africans; and if Christianity in West Africa, is ever\r\ndestined to make appreciable progress, it will be when it is provided\r\nwith its only feasible agent, a West African Church: a Church designed\r\nto respond to the needs of West Africa, which are not the needs of\r\nEurope; a Church whose servants shall be neither Europeans nor repatriate\r\n“Afro-Liberians,” but West African Negroes, imbued with the instincts and\r\npatriotism of race; a Church founded upon an enlightened acquaintance\r\nwith nature’s immovable laws; upon principles of true science, which is\r\ntrue religion; upon a wise recognition that what is good and proper and\r\nright for one great branch of the human family may be bad, improper, and\r\nwrong for another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nANGLO-FRENCH RELATIONS IN WEST AFRICA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of the relationship between England and France in West Africa\r\nis one to which every year that passes adds importance. The French\r\nhave during the last few years left us far behind in Western Africa,\r\nso far as territorial expansion is concerned. They have now a great\r\nEmpire there. They have acquired it by dint of persistent, far-sighted,\r\ncourageous effort; qualities which it is regrettable to state have been\r\nconspicuously lacking on the part of the British official world. If\r\na tithe of the energy which has distinguished Liverpool, Manchester,\r\nGlasgow, and Bristol merchants in Western Africa had been displayed by\r\nsuccessive British Governments, the possessions of Great Britain in West\r\nAfrica to-day would be infinitely more extensive than they are.\r\n\r\nIn addition to getting the better of us, in a territorial sense,\r\nFrance—whose possessions touch our own at almost every point—is steadily\r\nbecoming a serious commercial competitor. It is with that commercial\r\ncompetition that we shall have to reckon in the future to an increasing\r\ndegree. It is of two kinds. There is legitimate competition and unfair\r\ncompetition. In either case it behoves us to carefully study its nature\r\nand consequences; to draw the necessary lessons therefrom; to candidly\r\nacknowledge in a spirit of tolerant common sense that in many respects\r\nthe cause of its pressing hardly upon us is due to superior management\r\non the part of the French; to appeal to the spirit of equity and fair\r\nplay in our neighbours, when, as is the case in some parts of their West\r\nAfrican possessions at present, British merchants, who have powerfully\r\ncontributed in creating the trade of those very possessions, are getting\r\nneither fair play nor just treatment; and generally to brace ourselves\r\ntogether, realising that in West Africa, as everywhere else, the old\r\nposition of undisputed commercial supremacy which Great Britain was\r\nable to maintain at one time with very little trouble, can no longer be\r\nretained unless we shake off our facile opportunism and tackle the new\r\nconditions in a scientific manner.\r\n\r\nOf early French enterprise in Western Africa very little seems to be\r\nknown by the average Englishman; and yet the French were among the very\r\nfirst pioneers of Western Africa—probably the very first—before the\r\nPortuguese, at any rate, by at least 100 years. After the remarkable\r\nstudies recently published in the French African Committee’s journal by\r\nCommandant Binger, the distinguished chief of the African department of\r\nthe French Colonial Office, there is not, I think, any alternative but\r\nto accept as conclusive the French claim of being the first Europeans to\r\nvisit the West African coast. Spanish and Genoese navigators; the former\r\nhailing from Catalonia, the Lancashire of Spain, may possibly have been\r\ncontemporaneous with the French. But, apart from French testimony, it is\r\naffirmed by eminent Spanish authorities themselves, such as Navarette\r\nand Viera, that the French preceded their own countrymen. The Canaries\r\nwere discovered by a Genoese of French descent, and with a French name,\r\nMaloisel to wit, about 1275 A.D. They were also conquered by a Frenchman\r\nnamed De Béthancourt in the first years of the fifteenth century. In\r\nthe beginning of the fourteenth the West African coast as far south as\r\nthe Senegal certainly, and Sierra Leone probably, was regularly visited\r\nby French ships. So much has now been established. Whether French ships\r\nthen pushed south to the Gold Coast is not quite so clear. Personally I\r\nincline to the belief that this has also been satisfactorily made out,\r\nand the confirmatory testimony of Villaut-de-Bellefonds no longer stands\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nThe paucity of historical and documentary evidence has hitherto been\r\nthe principal objection to the French claim of priority. It has, of\r\ncourse, been made the most of by Portuguese historians. But, apart from\r\nthe circumstance that Commandant Binger has now been able to partly\r\nfill up the gap, and apart from the eminently reasonable explanation\r\nof Labat that the old records of the port of Dieppe, from whence many\r\nof the French ships bound to the West Coast started, were destroyed by\r\nthe bombardment of that port in 1694, there is very good reason, to my\r\nmind, why the Portuguese on the one hand should possess such splendid\r\nand unique accounts of their early exploits in West Africa from the\r\nmiddle of the fifteenth century onwards; and why, on the other hand, the\r\nFrench, who arrived on the scene at least a century before them, should\r\nbe so poorly represented in their own national archives. The reason is\r\nthis. The enterprise of Portugal in West Africa—which has so incomparably\r\nenriched the domain of geographical knowledge—was, from the first, an\r\nofficial undertaking. It was conceived by Prince Henry the Navigator,\r\none of the most remarkable figures in history, and all the resources\r\nof the science and literature of the age were invoked by him to give\r\nto the new epoch of discovery a national and historical permanency,\r\nwhich should be the means of reflecting glory for ever on Portuguese\r\nannals. Very different was the enterprise of the French. It was in no\r\nsense official, but private. It was undertaken not by renowned knights\r\nand important personages in kingly service, but by hardy, illiterate,\r\nindependent mariners and merchants of Normandy. The object was not, as in\r\nthe case of the Portuguese, fame, geographical discovery, and religious\r\nzeal, but trade. The men who fitted out the French ships and sent them\r\non their perilous course were Dieppe, Rouen, and Honfleur merchants; and\r\nthe French vessels returned, not with captives forcibly torn from their\r\nhomes with every accompaniment of cruelty in order to convert them to\r\na faith of peace, charity, and good-will, but with ivory, spices, and\r\ngold dust. That was the earliest form of trade in West Africa by the\r\npeople of Western Europe. The slave trade came afterwards. To this day a\r\nlocal industry in ivory carving exists at Dieppe, and every one who has\r\nvisited that quaint old seaport has noticed the numerous ivory ornaments\r\ndisplayed in the shop windows. If, therefore, the British merchants can\r\nclaim to be the latter-day pioneers of commercial enterprise in West\r\nAfrica; if during the century that has just closed their commercial\r\naptitude and initiative gained for them the foremost commercial position\r\non the West African littoral, it was French merchants who originally\r\nled the way. We have too often led the way ourselves in most parts of\r\nthe world to begrudge the French this honour, so far as Western Africa\r\nis concerned. Rather should it be a bond of respect, the twin sister of\r\nsympathy between us and our neighbours.\r\n\r\nThe first recorded instance upon which Englishmen and Frenchmen met off\r\nthe West African coast resulted, curiously enough, in an alliance. It\r\nhappened in this way. One William Towerson, in the course of a voyage to\r\nGuinea in 1555, being pursued by some Portuguese brigantines, opportunely\r\ncame across a fleet of French ships, with whom he joined company for\r\nsafety. The alliance does not seem to have been a very satisfactory one,\r\nas it turned out; still, it was an alliance, of sorts. This first meeting\r\ntook place some thirty-five years subsequent to the earliest known\r\nappearance of an Englishman in West Africa, in the person of one Andrew\r\nBattel, of Leigh—whether an ancestor of the three old maids of that ilk,\r\nhistory sayeth not—who put to sea in a Portuguese slaver, and after\r\nmany extraordinary adventures amongst the natives of Angola, succeeded\r\nin getting back to his native country. The beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury marked the awakening of Englishmen to the potentialities of the\r\nWest African trade. It had been preceded by a notable slackening in the\r\nenergies of Normandy merchants. The Hundred Years’ War with England had\r\ncrippled enterprise of any kind in France. The House of Valois was in a\r\nparlous state. The great war which began in 1337 and continued, with\r\noccasional breaks of short duration, until the marvellous successes of\r\nthe Maid of Orleans compelled the English to give way, was marked by\r\nthe crushing defeats the French sustained at Crecy and Poitiers at the\r\nhands of Edward III., and at Agincourt at the hands of Henry V.; and,\r\nto make use of some quoted words, “The State was reduced to bankruptcy,\r\nthe nobility excited to rebellion, and the mass of the people sunk in\r\nbarbarism.”\r\n\r\nNo sooner, however, had the victories of Joan of Arc infused new vitality\r\ninto the French, than we find renewed evidence of the enterprise of\r\nDieppe and Rouen merchants in West Africa. The revival of that enterprise\r\ncoincides with the entry upon the scene of English merchants: Windham,\r\nHawkins of evil memory, Rutter, Baker, and others, and the records bear\r\nwitness to the contemporary presence of French trading vessels on the\r\nWest Coast from Senegal to the Gold Coast. Recent discoveries of old\r\nmanuscripts, dating back to 1574, at Honfleur prove that from that year\r\nto 1583—a space of nine years—thirty-two French vessels left that port\r\nalone for West Africa. For some time English and French got on well\r\nenough on the West Coast. The power of Portugal was fast decaying, and\r\nadventurers of all nationalities, notably the Dutch, were hurrying to the\r\nspot. Then came more wars between English and French, with their natural\r\neffect upon commercial transactions in West Africa. In 1696 the French\r\ndestroyed the British settlement at the mouth of the Gambia. For the\r\nnext hundred years or so relations between the Europeans established or\r\ntrading on the West Coast appear as a tangle of animosities. Every one\r\nseemed to be fighting his neighbour, and pirates of all nationalities\r\nattacked every vessel they came across, including those owned or manned\r\nby men of their own race, even Gambia Castle, garrisoned by a British\r\nforce, being on one occasion captured and sacked by a notorious British\r\npirate named Davies, presumably a Welshman! Notwithstanding all this\r\ndire confusion, the English were gradually getting the upper hand all\r\ndown the coast. In 1794 Sierra Leone was bombarded by a French squadron\r\nwithout the authority apparently of the Revolutionary Government then in\r\npower. Twenty years later, the power of Napoleon having collapsed, all\r\nthat was left to France by the Treaty of Vienna was her settlement on the\r\ncoast of Senegal.\r\n\r\nEngland remained in a preponderating position politically and\r\ncommercially on the West African coast. Such, too, was her position in\r\nthe main until the revival of a French Colonial policy, under the impulse\r\nof those far-seeing statesmen Gambetta and Jules Ferry in 1883. At any\r\nperiod between 1815 and 1883 England had the opportunity of creating an\r\nextensive Empire in West Africa and annexing practically the whole coast.\r\n\r\nAnd here the curtain rings down on the old _régime_, and a new chapter in\r\nthe history of Anglo-French relationship in West Africa begins.\r\n\r\nTo whom should be properly attributed the initiation of the scramble for\r\nAfrica? It has been a cause of considerable inconvenience to the Cabinets\r\nof Europe, and of still greater inconvenience, we may feel tolerably\r\ncertain, to the natives of Africa. Each Power that participated in it\r\nthrows the onus on its neighbour. So far as West Africa is concerned,\r\nwhatever claim or credit may be taken, the French must, I think, be\r\nheld guilty or meritorious, according as individual opinion may differ.\r\nThe scramble in West Africa arose from what, for want of a better\r\ndescription, may be termed the discovery by the French of the West\r\nAfrican hinterlands. When Gambetta and Jules Ferry awoke the slumbering\r\ncolonial instincts of their countrymen, inland West Africa was to all\r\nintents and purposes a blank. Englishmen and Frenchmen sat on the coast,\r\nthe former doing a large trade and the latter little or none. In two\r\nplaces only were organised attempts at interior penetration being made.\r\nOn the Lower Niger, Englishmen were pushing their trade inland. On the\r\nSenegal, the era of political conquest begun by Faidherbe was being\r\nslowly developed, despite many difficulties and set-backs. The political\r\nenergies of Great Britain were paralysed by the resolution arrived at in\r\n1865 to abandon all Government action in West Africa, with the possible\r\nexception of Sierra Leone. France was still feeling the effects of the\r\ndisasters of 1870.\r\n\r\nWith the propaganda of Jules Ferry and Gambetta in favour of a policy\r\nof Colonial expansion, a change came o’er the spirit of the dream as\r\nregards West Africa. Backed by a strong body of opinion; supported by\r\nmen of note, such as M. Waldeck Rousseau, as he has himself recently\r\nreminded us, French activity in Western Africa became very pronounced,\r\nand the work once begun was not abandoned on account of the temporary\r\nreverses suffered by French arms in Tonquin, which drove Ferry from power\r\nand broke his heart. French missions, generally of a peaceful character,\r\nstarted eastwards and southwards from the Senegal, and northwards from\r\nthe coast, to explore the unknown interior. They reported it to be a\r\nfairly salubrious, fertile, cereal-producing and cattle-rearing country,\r\nunobstructed by dense forests such as are met with inland from the West\r\nCoast proper to a depth varying from sixty to two hundred miles. This\r\ncountry was inhabited by intelligent races relatively advanced in the\r\nscale of civilisation, possessing flourishing industries and commercial\r\naptitude. The French found regularly constituted States, more or less\r\nMuslimised, and in some of which social law and order had reached a high\r\nstage of development; large towns of 10,000 to 15,000 inhabitants with\r\nregular market-days, where iron smelting was highly advanced, where the\r\nnatives dressed in handsome clothes of their own manufacture, and used\r\nleather sandals, sword-belts, and scabbards, despatch-bags, and saddles\r\nfabricated by themselves. It was a revelation. The chief drawback about\r\nthis vast inland region, which seemed to offer such brilliant prospects\r\nunder able administrative supervision, was its liability to be swept by\r\nfire and sword at any moment by some over-zealous adherent of a certain\r\nmilitant sect of Mohammedans, which enjoyed great influence in the\r\nWestern Sudan. These French agents were generally well received, and by\r\ntheir means vast stretches of hitherto unknown country were opened up and\r\nbrought to the knowledge of the world.\r\n\r\nOut of these discoveries was born the desire—the very natural and\r\nlegitimate desire—on the part of the French to build up a mighty empire\r\nin West Africa, a black Indies, which should rival the Indies of the\r\nEast in extent, in wealth, and in the prestige which its acquisition\r\nwould confer. Exploring and semi-political missions were followed by\r\nexpeditions of a definite political character, and district after\r\ndistrict, State after State, tribe after tribe, came under French\r\ninfluence; by peaceful means in the majority of cases. All this time the\r\nEnglish were doing nothing, in an official sense. Liverpool men were\r\ncalling upon the Government to wake up to what was going on, but their\r\nefforts were entirely unsuccessful. Wider and wider grew the sweep of the\r\nFrench net, closer and closer to our own Colonies, which it threatened to\r\nthrottle in its meshes. Sierra Leone became encircled on three sides by\r\nFrench territory; the magnificent country of Futa-Jallon, the Switzerland\r\nof Western Africa as it has been called, which had been visited at\r\nvarious times by agents of the Government of Sierra Leone (notably Dr.\r\nBlyden), of which it formed the natural hinterland, was acquired by\r\nFrance without firing a shot. The Gold Coast, and Lagos, and what is\r\nnow known as Northern Nigeria—whose safety the Convention of 1890 was\r\nsupposed to guarantee—were in imminent danger of sharing a similar fate.\r\n\r\nI have often seen it stated, even by authorities of no mean order,\r\nthat the French were permitted or allowed to carry out the great task\r\nof securing the hinterlands of Western Africa. In point of fact, the\r\nstatement is very misleading and has had a somewhat mischievous effect.\r\nEngland was not in a position to allow or disallow. The French conceived\r\na plan and carried it out in the face of tremendous obstacles; they were\r\nprepared to undergo sacrifices which we were not prepared to accept, and\r\nsuch being the case, they were answerable to none but themselves. Their\r\nsuccess and our failure was the due measure of their enterprise and our\r\napathy.\r\n\r\nWhen the future of our Colonies appeared thoroughly compromised by the\r\ncutting off of the interior markets, the British Government suddenly\r\nrealised that Liverpool and Manchester merchants had been clearer-sighted\r\nthan British officialdom, and at the last moment efforts were made to\r\nsecure for the British Colonies such of the hinterlands which remained\r\nunabsorbed. Then arose a very delicate position, which taxed the\r\ndiplomatic resources of both Powers to the uttermost. British and French\r\nofficers with excitable native troops under their command, remained\r\nfacing one another in the far interior a few hundred yards distance for\r\nweeks at a time, awaiting instructions from the irrespective Governments.\r\nTo the good sense, tact, and mutual esteem of these officers is due that\r\npeace was preserved between England and France. We owe a deep debt of\r\ngratitude to these men, who, suffering from the debilitating effects of\r\nthe West African climate and the hardships attendant upon West African\r\ntravel—neither of which are conducive to sweetness of temper, managed to\r\nkeep their heads. Mainly thanks to them the quarrel was adjusted without\r\nbloodshed, and the Anglo-French Convention of 1898 was signed. It left\r\nour Colonies of the Gold Coast and Lagos greatly circumscribed, but\r\nassured us in “Nigeria” a magnificent territory some 504,000 square miles\r\nin extent.\r\n\r\nThe era of territorial rivalry between Great Britain and France in\r\nWestern Africa has, it may be legitimately assumed, quite passed away.\r\nWe continue to be rivals in commercial matters, but that is a peaceful\r\nrivalry—or should be—which ought not to exclude friendship. Nevertheless,\r\nas trade questions are often converted into fertile causes of dispute, it\r\nis essential that Englishmen and Frenchmen, in order to work harmoniously\r\ntogether in the future, should thoroughly understand one another’s\r\npoints of view in this connection. We, as a nation, are free traders.\r\nThe French, as a nation, are protectionists. It would be absurd and\r\nundignified for us to complain of the different economic standpoint\r\ntaken up by our neighbours. Moreover, there are various degrees of\r\nprotectionism in France. There is the extreme school of M. Méline,\r\nwhich, if its doctrines were strictly applied to the French West African\r\nColonies, would ruin them in five years. There is the school which\r\nupholds partial protectionism in France, but favours freedom of trade in\r\nthe French Colonies. The latter is happily gaining in strength. We should\r\nendeavour as far as in us lies to work with the representatives of this\r\nschool. One of the clauses of the 1898 Convention, which caused a great\r\noutcry in France when it became known, stipulated that no differential\r\ntreatment was to be meted out to British trade throughout a considerable\r\npart of the French West African possessions for a term of thirty years.\r\nThe following extract, bearing on this subject, from an address read by\r\nM. Bohn, the head of the largest firm of French West African merchants,\r\nbefore the Marseilles Geographical Society, in September 1898, three\r\nmonths after the Convention was signed, is interesting:\r\n\r\n    “A certain colonial school,” said M. Bohn, “starting from the\r\n    premise that the only object of colonies is to favour the\r\n    outlet of goods manufactured in the mother country, demands the\r\n    application of prohibitive tariffs upon foreign goods imported\r\n    into our colonies. This system, which contributed so powerfully\r\n    to lose Spain her finest colonies, flourishes in Gaboon,\r\n    which is the least prosperous of our colonies, and which only\r\n    subsists at all by constant grants in aid from the metropolis.\r\n    These examples are hardly encouraging. On the other hand, we\r\n    are able to see that those of our colonies which are developing\r\n    themselves in the most rapid and satisfactory manner are those\r\n    where no differential tariffs exist.... From that point of view\r\n    it is certain the Franco-English Convention of June 1898, by\r\n    abolishing for a period of thirty years all differential duties\r\n    in the Ivory Coast and Dahomey, has assured for that period the\r\n    commercial prosperity of these colonies.”\r\n\r\nThat notable statement and others like it (the truth of which has been\r\namply borne out since) show that experienced Frenchmen engaged in the\r\nWest African trade realise, as we do, that a policy of free trade is one\r\nwhich in West Africa spells commercial success by the nation which adopts\r\nit. The existence of such views in France is a very encouraging sign for\r\nthose who firmly believe that trade is the greatest progressive agency\r\nwhich can be brought to bear upon the relations between Western Europe\r\nand Western Africa.\r\n\r\nRecent events are proving that a natural community of interests exists\r\nbetween British and French merchants in Western Africa; that they will\r\nhave to fight a common foe, the Concessionnaire, and that every action\r\ncalculated to bring them into closer relationship is a step in the right\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTEN YEARS OF FRENCH ACTION IN WEST AFRICA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of France’s action in West Africa during the last ten\r\nyears has been so remarkable that it deserves to be recorded in some\r\ndetail, and where possible her policy may be usefully compared with\r\nour own. On January 23, 1892, the Paris _Figaro_ published a literary\r\nsupplement entitled “Our African Domain,” in which was set forth by\r\nvarious competent authorities—amongst whom was Captain Binger;[202]\r\nEmile Masqueray, the well-known student of Algerian problems; Georges\r\nRolland, one of the foremost advocates of the Trans-Saharan Railway; and\r\n“Harry Alis,” the redoubtable Colonial propagandist, Lord Cromer’s _bête\r\nnoire_, whose tragic end will be in the recollection of many—the past\r\nachievements, actual position and future aspirations of France in Western\r\nand Central Africa. The supplement was divided into five parts, entitled\r\nrespectively “Algeria”; “Penetration towards the Chad”; “Senegal and\r\nDependencies”; “Our Position on the Gulf of Guinea”; “Congo and Chad.”\r\nAt the time this supplement appeared, the revival of Colonial ambition\r\nin France, which owed its inception largely to the foresight and courage\r\nof Jules Ferry, had taken firm root among the _élite_ of French public\r\nopinion. But although the seed where it fell gave forth lusty fruit, the\r\nsowers were relatively few, and the area under cultivation was still but\r\nsmall in 1892. The Chamber of Deputies was slow to grant fresh credits.\r\nPoliticians as a whole viewed the eloquence of Eugène Etienne and other\r\nexponents of the Ferry school with ill-disguised nervousness, if not with\r\npositive apprehension, fearing that the country was being turned from its\r\ntrue business of guarding against possible aggression from Germany, and\r\nwas playing into Bismarck’s hands by rushing into Colonial adventures\r\nwhich it was known that Bismarck, for his own reasons, was desirous of\r\nencouraging. No one party or rather group cared to identify itself too\r\nclosely with the expansionists, remembering the whirlwind of popular\r\npassion which assailed and overwhelmed _le Tonkinois_. On the other hand,\r\nit was not wise to entirely dissociate one’s self from a movement which\r\nwas steadily gaining a hold over the masses. So Parliament vacillated,\r\nand, swayed by contrary winds, voted funds one minute and sought to\r\nwithdraw them the next.\r\n\r\nThe _Figaro’s_ supplement was widely criticised. The schemes it\r\nelaborated were not merely ambitious, they were gigantic. “Our policy,”\r\nit argued, “is to make one homogeneous entity of Algeria, Senegal, and\r\nCongo _viâ_ the Tuareg-Sahara and the Central and Western Sudan.” The\r\ntimid Deputy shuddered at the prospect. What must have been, even to the\r\nmaster-minds who initiated the policy, not much more than a fond hope\r\nstrengthened by an unshaken faith in the destiny of the country; what,\r\nin the eyes of those who opposed it, appeared as a monstrous figment of\r\nthe imagination, is to-day in its main lines a reality! How has it been\r\naccomplished?\r\n\r\n“Our intentions are pure and noble, our cause is just, the future\r\ncannot fail us,” wrote Faidherbe in 1859, and, on the whole, despite\r\nerrors, despite the effects of temporary reaction coming after acute\r\ndisappointment, despite some individual instances of cruelty and\r\noppression, events have justified Faidherbe’s confident declaration.\r\nThe work of France in Africa during the last ten years and more has, in\r\nthe main, been a work of progress tending to benefit the populations\r\nwith whom she has come in contact. Notable exceptions there have been,\r\nof course, especially during the years 1897 and 1898, when the scramble\r\nfor West Africa was at its height, and under the spell of an insensate\r\nrivalry deeds were committed by all the parties in the struggle which\r\ncannot be too strongly condemned. To France’s debit account must be\r\nplaced the ruthless proceedings of Bretonnet in Borgu; the needless\r\nbloodshed of which Mossi, Kipprisi, and Gurunsi were the scenes; the\r\ninevitable barbarity which characterised Marchand’s hunt for carriers\r\nin the Upper Ubanghi and Bahr-el-Ghazal. These incidents in themselves\r\nare odious and reprehensible; but it is only fair to recognise that they\r\nwere the outcome of international jealousies the responsibility for which\r\nwas collective rather than single, shared in by other Powers as well\r\nas by France herself. In what may be regarded as France’s own sphere\r\nof influence, acts have also been perpetrated from time to time which\r\ncall for censure. The punishment meted out to certain towns hostile to\r\nthe French in the Western Sudan have been altogether disproportionate\r\nto the offence. In the case of the French officers Voulet and Chanoine,\r\nan incalculable amount of suffering was inflicted upon the unfortunate\r\npeople on the western banks of the Niger. But from these isolated\r\ntransgressions against the principles of humanity, culpable as they have\r\nbeen, the records of no European Power in Africa are free; and they\r\ncannot, in the circumstances of France, be held to negative or even\r\nweaken the advantages she has undoubtedly conferred upon the population\r\nof the Western and Central Sudan, nor yet tarnish the great reputation\r\nFrance has achieved in the emancipation of millions from centuries of\r\ntyranny and invasion. If she has had her Voulets and Chanoines, France\r\ncan show in the persons of her De Brazzas, her Bingers, her Monteils,\r\nher Crozats, her Foureaus, Noirots, Gentils, Hoursts, and Lenfants,\r\nperformances which the subjects of other Powers may have equalled but\r\nhave not surpassed; always excepting Barth, whose moral grandeur towers\r\nhigh above that of all his competitors on West African soil.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when the Sieur de Brüe—one of the clearest-headed Frenchmen\r\nwho ever served his country in Africa—paid ceremonious visits to the\r\nKing of Kayor and the “grand Seratik” of the Fulas at the close of the\r\nseventeenth and at the beginning of the eighteenth century; from the\r\ntime when raiding bands of Trarza Moors, extending their depredations to\r\nthe very confines of St. Louis (1840-60) compelled Faidherbe to take the\r\noffensive against them, to the present day, it has been the lot of France\r\nto find herself confronted in West Africa with races differentiating in\r\nevery respect from the true Negro of the coast regions—the people whom\r\nEngland had, up to 1900, been chiefly concerned with. Eight years before,\r\na certain Select Committee of the House of Commons, frightened at the\r\nresponsibilities England was assuming in West Africa, pusillanimously\r\nrecommended the abandonment of all our settlements except Sierra Leone,\r\nthus enunciating a policy the evil effects of which continued until\r\n1895 and greatly limited our footing in West and Central Africa; France\r\nhad just emerged successfully from a death grapple with one of the most\r\npowerful individuals that ever sprung from African loins, el Haj-Omar,\r\nthe great Tukulor Mallam and warrior. Looking backward at that long\r\nvista of years, when France was slowly but irresistibly thrusting her\r\ninfluence into West Africa, _viâ_ the Senegal and Upper Niger, by pouring\r\nout her treasure and the blood of her sons like water; while England\r\nremained supine on the coast heedless of the representations of her\r\nmerchant-pioneers, it was not surprising that, awakening almost too late\r\nfrom our lethargy, we should have found the French, having triumphed over\r\ntheir obstacles in the north, forging southwards and cutting off our\r\nrich hinterlands in the interior. Writing to the Marquis of Dufferin in\r\n1892, Lord Salisbury contrasted the policy of Great Britain and France in\r\nWestern Africa. “France,” wrote Lord Salisbury, “from her basis on the\r\nSenegal Coast, has pursued steadily the aim of establishing herself on\r\nthe Upper Niger and its affluents.... Great Britain, on the other hand,\r\nhas adopted the policy of advance by commercial enterprise.” There was,\r\nindeed, on the part of Liverpool, Manchester, and Bristol merchants,\r\nplenty of “commercial enterprise,” but it would have been difficult for\r\nLord Salisbury to have quoted a single instance where that “commercial\r\nenterprise” had constituted “a policy of advance.”\r\n\r\nIt is due to the type of native inhabiting the chief radius of France’s\r\noperations in Western Africa, that her task has been rendered so\r\ndangerous and so difficult, and its fulfilment so remarkable. Criticise\r\nas we may, and often enough unjustly, because ignorantly, the colonising\r\ncapacities of our Gallic neighbours, and the fluctuations of their\r\ncolonial policy, it is beyond question that no nation on earth could\r\nhave achieved what she has achieved in Western Africa, without the\r\npossession of a doggedness and determination for which we do not—to\r\nour own injury, be it said—even now, give her the credit which she\r\ndeserves. For centuries upon centuries the enormous tract which lies\r\nbetween the edge of the Sahara Desert and the fringe of the tropical\r\nforest belt—consisting for the most part of grassy uplands varied by\r\nwide plains of amazing fertility, by reason of the yearly overflow of\r\nthe waters of the Niger—had been the cockpit of Africa. Empire after\r\nempire rose and fell; invasion and counter-invasion swept devastatingly\r\nover the country. The splendours of Jenne and Timbuctoo vanished with\r\nthe sway of the Songhay, beneath the bullets of Morocco’s musketeers.\r\nFulani domination arose and gave way before Tukulor cruelties. Semi-negro\r\nkingdoms came into being, declared their independence of this or that\r\nconqueror, only to be subdued, while their victors had, in turn, to bite\r\nthe dust before some stronger foe. The mingling of races in that vast\r\nregion has no parallel in Africa. Ages ago the pastoral Fula—veritable\r\nAsiatic—had settled therein with his flocks and herds, destined in\r\ntime by the sheer force of superior intellect to become the master\r\nwhere he had been either the guest or the despised tenant. Later came\r\ninfiltrations of the Moorish element proper; pastorals also these,\r\nemigrating from the plateaux of Adrar to the well-watered valley of the\r\nNiger. Tuaregs, the redskins of the Sahara, descendants, as some affect\r\nto believe, of those tall, fair-haired, long-limbed warriors of Northern\r\nEurope who, about 1500 B.C., advanced slowly through Gaul and Spain,\r\nand crossing the Mediterranean in ships, landed on the North African\r\nCoast, ever pushing southwards, overcoming the terrors of the desert and\r\nreaching the green pastures beyond, but repairing the greater part of the\r\nyear to the desolate Saharan solitudes of which they remain the virtual\r\nmasters, though Foureau and his _tirailleurs_ have for the first time\r\nin history passed through without paying the toll. Arabs too, but again\r\nlater, and generally speaking farther south and east in Kanem, Wadai and\r\nBaghirmi, where Lamy met his death and Gentil was fighting two years and\r\nmore; Arabs from the north with caravans of merchandise, and other Arabs\r\nfrom the east; Shuwas, of whom no man knows the history or the origin.\r\nThey intermarried, these tawny, straight-haired nomadic strangers, with\r\nthe aboriginal blacks, or raped their women, as the case might be; and\r\nfrom these unions, legitimate or otherwise, through long centuries,\r\nthere sprang into existence fierce cross-races and wild, reared in war,\r\nnurtured in an atmosphere of turmoil and brigandage; negro Fula, negro\r\nMoor, negro Arab, exaggerating the savage instincts of the parent stock,\r\nwhom they turned and rent when strong enough. One such hybrid product\r\nbecame in time the scourge of the Western Sudan—the Tukulor, offspring\r\nof Negro (Joloff) and Fula, unsparing, ruthless, dreaded alike by Fula\r\nand Negro, and whose atrocities are written in letters of blood from Toro\r\n(Senegal) to the frontiers of Hausa.\r\n\r\nIn this medley of races there came in the tenth century of our era\r\nthe first whisperings of a revealed religion. The whispering quickly\r\nchanged to the deep hum of many voices proclaiming aloud the word of the\r\nProphet. Islam spread with inconceivable rapidity. The Fulani became\r\nspeedy converts, but the arts they employed to win over their pagan\r\nneighbours were usually peaceful. Not so with the Tukulors and the other\r\ncross-races. They saw in it naught but a fresh incentive to warlike\r\ndeeds, and soon professed Mohammedans were not merely massacring the\r\ninfidels, but waging battle against their more peaceable co-religionists.\r\nAs though this were not enough, another fruitful cause of bloodshed\r\nand disturbance was fated to arise, and still further plunge in woe\r\nthis distracted country. The Portuguese adventurers on the coast, in\r\nthe course of their professed desire to save the soul of the Negro,\r\nmade a discovery, to wit, that the muscular development of the Negro\r\neminently fitted him for manual labour. From that discovery dates the\r\nmost atrocious traffic the world has ever witnessed. In their greed\r\nfor slaves, the Christians of Western Europe and of America—without\r\ndistinction of nationality, though perhaps the Portuguese and English\r\nwere the worst offenders—set tribe against tribe; and the better to\r\nstimulate the industry, imported wholesale guns and gunpowder, objects\r\nwhich they ascertained the Negroes greatly coveted. The blacks waged war\r\nright merrily upon one another, and their so-called prisoners of war\r\nfilled the slavers’ hulks. Presently the tawny races beyond the forest\r\nbelt joined in the game, desiring above all things the acquisition of\r\nguns and the wherewithal to use them, which meant power and increased\r\nfacilities for plunder. Slave-raiding then assumed almost incredible\r\nproportions. Internecine warfare received a new and terrible impetus. No\r\nexcuse, whether valid or imaginary, was henceforth needed to attack one’s\r\nneighbour; and where in former days contentment might have been secured\r\nby a rich booty of cattle and sheep, the requirements of the case now\r\nnecessitated the capture of the human animal himself. In such a country,\r\ndesolated by centuries of strife; among such a people, upon whose vices\r\nEurope had grafted her own; under such circumstances, has lain the\r\ndestiny of France in Western Africa.\r\n\r\nA favourite argument used by those who favour a militarist policy in\r\nNorthern Nigeria consists in pointing to the action of the French in\r\nthe Western Sudan. It is held by some to be inconsistent to express\r\napproval of the military trend of French policy in regions adjacent to\r\nNorthern Nigeria, and to disapprove of it in Northern Nigeria itself.\r\nI do not think that the charge of inconsistency will bear examination.\r\nIn the first place, we should be careful not to generalise. In West\r\nAfrica proper—that is, in the coastwise regions, the home of the true\r\nNegroes—the military policy has, on the whole, been rarely resorted to\r\nby the French. In the Western Sudan, although, no doubt, a good deal\r\nof bloodshed might have been avoided at different times, I fail to see\r\nmyself, bearing in mind the object of French policy, how that object\r\ncould have been obtained without military conquest. As far as the purely\r\nmoral aspect of the matter is concerned, the right of any European Power\r\nto interfere in the internal affairs of West Africa may be queried; but\r\nif a given region can, in West Africa, be pointed to where the results of\r\nsuch interference are of a beneficent nature, that region is the Western\r\nSudan. France is restoring to the enormous expanse of territory between\r\nthe Niger and the tropical forest belt the prosperity which it possessed\r\nin the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries under the Songhay, when Jenne\r\nwas the granary and the store-house of the Niger countries. She is laying\r\nthe basis of a prosperity far greater than in those days, because she\r\nis able to bring peace where the Songhays could not. Having conquered\r\nthe cross-races, she wisely refrains from either interfering with their\r\ncustoms, such as domestic slavery, upon which the social fabric of West\r\nAfrica depends, or from allowing, save in strictly circumscribed limits,\r\nChristian propaganda among them, being well aware that such propaganda\r\nin Mohammedan communities but newly subjugated is the certain precursor\r\nof trouble, bloodshed, and fanaticism. She has hunted down and destroyed\r\nthe four tyrants who successively barred her way to the interior, and\r\nwho had perpetrated untold miseries upon hundreds of thousands of human\r\nbeings—El-Haji-Omar, Amadu, Samory and Rabah. Had she been able to\r\nacquire the services of these men, it would perhaps have been better, but\r\nthe body of evidence is against the possibility of her power to have done\r\nso. But there is a limit to approval of French military action, and if,\r\nnow that France’s political influence is internationally secure in the\r\nregions east and north of the Chad, she chooses to embark open-eyed in a\r\nstruggle with the Senussi, she will be making a grave mistake. Unless\r\ndeliberately incited by unprovoked aggression, her game there is to\r\nsheath the sword and give diplomacy the innings, and those Frenchmen who\r\nsee the danger of precipitate, immature action in Wadai and Kanem, and\r\nare strenuously agitating against it, are wise in their generation.[203]\r\n\r\nBut, taken all in all, the circumstances in which England finds herself\r\nin Northern Nigeria, and the circumstances in which France found herself\r\nin relation to the Western Sudan before the conquest, are widely\r\ndifferent. The aims pursued by France in the Western Sudan, and by the\r\nEnglish in Nigeria, were not in their inception the same. The regions\r\ncoveted by France were for the most part widely removed—at immense\r\ndistances indeed—from her basis on the coast and her basis on the Senegal\r\nRiver. To make her claims to those regions _internationally_ valid, it\r\nwas requisite that France should wield some tangible influence over them,\r\nand in many cases that was impossible without conquest.\r\n\r\nBut the British in Northern Nigeria were very differently placed.\r\nNorthern Nigeria was the prolongation, so to speak, of the British base\r\nin “the Rivers.” It lay immediately at the back of them. The possession\r\nof the Niger’s mouth facilitated the extension of British influence up\r\nthe River and its affluent the Binue. Moreover, British merchants and\r\nexplorers had ascended both the Niger and the Binue many years before;\r\nthey had paved the way for what was to follow; and for fifteen years\r\nbefore the advent of direct Imperial control in Northern Nigeria, its\r\nnative potentates had been united in close ties of political relationship\r\nwith a British Chartered Company. The Government stepped into the shoes\r\nof the Chartered Company, not to play the _rôle_ of _conquisitador_ and\r\ninitiator, but to reap crops sown for it; to consolidate work already\r\nhalf accomplished. It should, in parenthesis, be stated that France\r\nmanages the Western Sudan, a territory very much larger than Northern\r\nNigeria, and where a state of continuous internecine warfare had existed\r\nfor centuries, with an army not more than 3000 strong. Again, if warfare\r\nhas attended the establishment of French influence in the Shari region,\r\nit has been due to special circumstances. Thus Gentil acquired a\r\nProtectorate over Baghirmi without firing a shot. It was only when the\r\ncountry which France had placed under her protection was invaded and laid\r\nwaste by Rabah that military action became a duty.\r\n\r\nNo comparison is really possible between the respective parts of Great\r\nBritain and France. Both are distinct, and must be judged according to\r\ntheir antecedents and special features.\r\n\r\nIn Northern Nigeria[204] we have to do with native rulers with whom we\r\nhave been in treaty relationship for fifteen years, and in commercial\r\nrelationship for longer still. They are our wards, we are in a fiduciary\r\ncapacity towards them; they are our _protégés_. We undertook by treaty to\r\nsubsidise them; we pledged ourselves by treaty “not to interfere with the\r\ncustoms” of their people. It should be our object, following the precepts\r\nof Sir Andrew Clarke, to make those rulers “far bigger” men than they\r\nare, not to break them. They come of a proud race, a capable race, of\r\nsuperior mental calibre, possessed of statesmanship and skill. They have\r\nplayed a great part in the history of Western Africa. Barth, who knew\r\nthem well, has said of them that “they are the most intelligent people in\r\nAfrica.” To reduce them to impotence; to scatter their power; to break\r\nthe organisation they have created into small pieces would be politically\r\nfoolish, practically unwise, morally unjust, Imperially disastrous.\r\nTo strengthen their rule where weak; to perfect it where oppressive;\r\nto assist them, work with them, and through them along their natural\r\nlines; to interfere as little as possible with the customs and habits\r\nof themselves and their people; to respect their religious beliefs; to\r\nwork gradually, peacefully, tactfully, for the attainment of the only\r\nconceivable objects which have taken us to their country—commercial\r\ndevelopment, advancement, prosperity—those should be the political\r\nprinciples guiding us in Northern Nigeria.\r\n\r\nThe accomplishment of the colossal plan sketched out by the _Figaro_\r\nin 1892, viz. the unification (if the word be permissible) of the\r\nFrench possessions in Africa by expeditions from north, west, and\r\nsouth, designed to meet on the shores of Lake Chad, may now be briefly\r\ngiven. It is a stirring tale. The first attempt—if we exclude that of\r\nFlatters from the north, of which the purpose was limited—was made from\r\nthe south, by the blue-eyed, fair-haired enthusiast, Paul Crampbel. He\r\nfell assassinated by Rabah’s emissaries at El Kuti on April 15, 1891.\r\nDybowski and Maistre, sent out by the French African Committee in\r\nCrampbel’s footsteps, had to retire without doing much more than useful\r\nexploring work. Then came Gentil’s turn, a modest naval lieutenant who,\r\nprofiting by Rabah’s complications in Bornu, succeeded after incredible\r\ndifficulties in reaching the mouth of the Shari (after signing a treaty\r\nof Protectorate with Baghirmi) and floating a small steamer upon the\r\nwaters of the mysterious lake. But the success was short-lived. Rabah\r\nrecrossed the Shari, forced the French to retire, and once again swept\r\nBaghirmi with fire and sword. France hurried fresh reinforcements to the\r\nspot, and these under Bretonnet were attacked by Rabah and decimated. A\r\nfurther and more vigorous effort was required.\r\n\r\nAnd here the scene shifts to the north. In October 1898 that intrepid\r\nexplorer, Foureau, left the oasis of Sadrata, near Wargla, in Algeria,\r\nat the head of a force of picked men, 310 strong, consisting of troopers\r\nfrom the Senegalese and Saharan _tirailleurs_, than whom there are\r\nprobably no more splendid fighters in the world, unless it be our own\r\nSikhs. Foureau was accompanied by three civilian friends. Commandant\r\nLamy led the military portion of the expedition, which comprised four\r\nother officers besides himself. The object of the expedition was to\r\ncross the Algerian Sahara and reach the Chad, while Gentil and Bretonnet\r\ngained a firm foothold on its shores by working upwards from the Congo\r\nand Ubanghi. Foureau and his companions plunged into the unknown desert,\r\nand for ten months entirely disappeared from view. Frequent rumours of a\r\nwholesale massacre reached Europe, and remembering the fate of Douls, De\r\nPalot, Dournaux-Dupérré, and Joubert, Flatters and Bonnier, at the hands\r\nof the fierce nomads who roam the desolate wastes through which Foureau\r\nhad to pass, France held her breath. If Foureau fell, it would not only\r\nbe a frightful disaster, fraught with peril to French policy throughout\r\nher vast Mohammedan zone in Africa; it might also mean a revulsion of\r\npopular feeling, a hanging up of cherished schemes for a generation or\r\nmore. But Foureau did not fall or fail. He reached the Asben oases in\r\nsafety, and demonstrated to timid minds that the Tuaregs, when confronted\r\nby a well-armed and disciplined force, skilfully led and sufficiently\r\nnumerous to inspire respect, prefer, in the main, to hold themselves at a\r\ndistance.[205]\r\n\r\nAgain the scene changes. The plan was half-performed. The third advance\r\ncame from the west by the way of the Niger Bend. It was at first attended\r\nby the direst results. The gallant Cazemajou met a cruel and treacherous\r\ndeath at Zinder. Voulet and Chanoine, who succeeded him, showed what evil\r\nunlimited authority and the disordering effects of the African climate\r\ncan work upon ill-regulated minds. Denounced by one of their subordinates\r\nfor barbarous conduct towards the natives, they, having already forgotten\r\nthe ordinary dictates of humanity, forgot alike honour and patriotism,\r\nfoully murdered the superior officer who had been instructed to replace\r\nthem, tore off their uniforms, declared themselves renegades, and\r\nperpetrated the wildest excesses. But their shrift was short, and they\r\nsoon met their fate from the rifles of the native soldiers they had\r\ntemporarily led astray.\r\n\r\nThe French Government, however, did not relinquish its determination. The\r\nfragments of the Voulet-Chanoine mission were got together, and under\r\nthe joint leadership of Captain Joalland and Lieutenant Meynier reached\r\nthe Chad, subsequently joining Gentil’s forces in the Lower Shari. By\r\nthis time Foureau had also gained the Chad. The three missions, which\r\nafter so many vicissitudes thus met together in their common goal, were\r\nimmediately called upon to face a new and most formidable danger. Against\r\nthe town of Kusri or Kusseri, where the French had established their\r\nheadquarters, Rabah was marching at the head of 5000 men, of whom 2000\r\nwere armed with guns of various patterns. He had also three fieldpieces,\r\ncaptured from Bretonnet. The French disposed of a total strength of\r\n774 officers and men—the latter natives without exception—with four\r\nfieldpieces. They were assisted by 1500 Baghirmi auxiliaries, who do not\r\nappear to have been of much use, contenting themselves with looting after\r\nthe battle was over. Rabah pitched his war camp three miles from Kusri,\r\nand awaited the onslaught of the French. It proved to be irresistible.\r\nRabah himself perished. His losses amounted to 1000 killed and wounded,\r\nand his camp, with the whole of its contents, fell into the hands of\r\nthe French. The French losses were severe. They included the brave\r\nLamy, Captain Cointet, a white non-commissioned officer and seventeen\r\nmen killed. Their wounded amounted to sixty, among them Captain Lamothe\r\nand Lieutenants Meynier and Galland. But the victory was complete,\r\nand Rabah, the noise of whose conquests had filled Central Africa for\r\nclose upon a quarter of a century; whose destructive strides had left\r\na bloody track from the Bahr-el-Ghazal to the Chad; Rabah, the last of\r\nthe great _conquisitadores_, had gone the way of El-Haji-Omar, and of\r\nSamory. The plan elaborated by the _Figaro_ eight years previously was an\r\naccomplished fact.\r\n\r\nSince Rabah’s overthrow the French have been engaged in systematically\r\nconsolidating their hold upon the Central Sudan and the lower Shari. M.\r\nTerrier, the able Secrétaire-Général of the French African Committee,\r\nexplains in the Committee’s Bulletin for April 1901 the procedure which\r\nis being adopted. One cannot but be impressed with the grasp, the\r\nsagacity, and the statesmanship displayed. The Shari region has been\r\ndivided into two districts, the most northerly of which abuts on Lake\r\nChad, and includes Baghirmi and the Shari mouths. It is administered\r\non military lines. The southern district, comprising the upper reaches\r\nof the river and its affluents, is administered on civil lines. The\r\npopulation of the southern district is composed of Negroes, whose\r\nreligion is fetishism, or what it pleases us to call fetishism. The\r\nnorthern district is inhabited by various branches of the Negroid\r\nBaghirmis; by the Kotokos; by the Shuwa Arabs, and by a few pastoral\r\nFulani. The pagans of the southern district have for centuries been\r\nsubjected to the raids of the Arabised-Negroes of Bornu and Baghirmi. It\r\nwas from among them that the principal supplies of slaves which used to\r\nfind their way across the desert route to Tripoli before the Firman of\r\n1865 were drawn. France, by ridding them of their external foes, claims\r\nthe right to make them share in her administrative expenses. She is all\r\nthe more justified in doing so, as for many years to come, and until\r\nthe Shari is connected with the Ubanghi by a railway, there will be no\r\ntrade upon which to levy duties in order to obtain revenue. One-half of\r\nthe population is expected to furnish carriers, and the other half pays\r\nan annual tax of four pounds of rubber per hut, of which two pounds is\r\nreturned to the chiefs as commission. We are assured—on the authority\r\nof M. Terrier—that the chiefs are bringing in the tax voluntarily from\r\nlong distances. In the northern district, which was directly under\r\nRabah’s influence, the French found an existing organisation which they\r\nhave in the main retained, but the tax levied by the Emir of Baghirmi\r\nupon his subjects being considered too heavy, the French have reduced\r\nit by two-thirds, thus relieving the population from an undue burden\r\nof taxation. The Emir and his chiefs—through whom French influence is\r\nexercised—benefit by this reduced tax; that is to say, they keep it for\r\nthemselves. Contributions of slaves to the Emir and chiefs in the form of\r\ntribute by the sub-chiefs are, of course, suppressed. The revenue of the\r\nEmir being thus limited, but nevertheless assured to him, together with\r\nthe continuation of his prestige, the Emir himself, who owes his throne\r\nto the French, and has, moreover, been relieved by them of the necessity\r\nof paying an annual tribute to Wadai, is expected to furnish annually\r\nto the Administration 240 pounds of millet, 500 cloths, and 100 oxen,\r\namounting roughly to £1680.\r\n\r\nHere, then, as in the Western Sudan, the words of Faidherbe ring sound;\r\nand M. Etienne, speaking at a Conference held the other day at the Paris\r\nColonial School, was only saying what has hitherto been true when he\r\nasserted that:\r\n\r\n“France can in all sincerity maintain that she has delivered the peoples\r\nof inland Africa from an intolerable yoke. She has liberated millions of\r\nhuman beings from sanguinary tyrants who had reduced them to slavery. She\r\nhas accomplished a work of emancipation, of liberty, and of generosity.”\r\nIt would be sad indeed if, led astray by evil counsels, France should be\r\ninduced in another portion of her West African domain, viz. French Congo,\r\nto tarnish the great reputation she has undoubtedly built up.\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted whether the problems with which France has had to\r\ncontend in West Africa have ever been rightly understood among us, for\r\nEnglishmen are usually generous-minded enough to appreciate good work\r\ncarried out by others, even though the others are sometimes rivals.\r\nCertain is it that of the nature of French exploits in West and Central\r\nAfrica the average Englishman is hopelessly ignorant, and even English\r\nwriters of repute persist in shutting their eyes to the great, the almost\r\nrevolutionary changes which experience, dearly bought, has wrought in\r\nFrench Colonial conceptions. We have failed as a nation in doing justice\r\nto the actions of the French in Africa. We have underrated their capacity\r\nand refused to admit the existence at their council boards of a central\r\nplan carefully matured which the frequent shuffling of Ministerial\r\nportfolios merely retarded but did not alter. At the present moment we\r\napparently will not realise that France is applying to the economic\r\ndevelopment of her vast territories the same strenuousness of purpose\r\nwith which she steadily pursued her work of conquest and absorption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE FRENCH POSSESSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe logic of facts is gradually bringing home to Englishmen that the\r\nFrench have within recent years revolutionised the commercial position of\r\ntheir West African possessions; of those possessions, that is, which are\r\nat present commercially exploitable. But a singular amount of ignorance\r\ncontinues to prevail on the subject, and in non-specialist circles the\r\nFrench possessions are still in a sorry condition both commercially\r\nand financially. So far is that deep-rooted idea from the truth, that\r\nnot only are the French doing exceedingly well commercially in West\r\nAfrica; but they are doing comparatively better than we are. Moreover,\r\ntheir possessions are actually costing less to manage, and economy\r\nin administration is not secured at the expense of requisite public\r\nworks; quite the contrary. The days when Englishmen could represent the\r\nideals of French Colonial management in West Africa in the light of a\r\ncustom-house official and a soldier; an expenditure overlapping revenue;\r\nconstant grants from the mother country; an embryonic trade and a growing\r\nbudgetary deficit, have passed and gone. In some respects the French\r\nare turning the tables upon us. Even so distinguished an authority as\r\nSir Harry Johnston falls into the popular error when he says that “with\r\nthe exception of Tunis, there is not a single French possession in\r\nAfrica which is self-supporting or other than a drain upon the French\r\nexchequer.” It is a complete fallacy, and it can be proved so up to\r\nthe hilt. Here and there, it is true, the old, bad, paralytic red-tape\r\nconception remains, but on the whole the French possessions north of the\r\nBights are progressing with an astonishing rapidity; able to construct\r\nimportant public works out of their own surplus revenues, and to enter\r\ninto railway contracts on guaranteed loans of their own raising. Miss\r\nKingsley, in her “West African Studies,” suggested that, granting the\r\npossibility of France becoming “commercially intelligent,” she might\r\n“pocket the West African trade down to Lagos from Senegal,” and there can\r\nbe no doubt that if British policy in West Africa continues to be carried\r\nout on the present lines, and if French policy in West Africa can escape\r\nthe contamination of the concessionnaire _régime_ applied with such\r\ndeplorable results in French Congo, France can and will do an enormous\r\namount of commercial damage to our possessions in West Africa, and on a\r\nfair field, in legitimate competition. Senegal, French Guinea, the Ivory\r\nCoast and Dahomey are all self-supporting, and the growth of trade in\r\nthese possessions is in all conscience eloquent enough, as the following\r\nfigures show:\r\n\r\n               SENEGAL        GUINEA       IVORY COAST     DAHOMEY\r\n\r\n    1889     £1,520,000      £320,000        £160,000      £360,000\r\n    1899      2,920,000     1,000,000         520,000     1,000,000\r\n    1900      3,189,400       973,000[206]    686,300     1,101,084\r\n\r\nNone of our Colonies can show such a rate of progress as their young\r\n(Senegal excepted) Gallic competitors. The increase is really phenomenal.\r\nIn the French Colonies mentioned the expenditure is well within the\r\nrevenue. In French Guinea conspicuously so. Would that we could say the\r\nsame of our possessions! In all these Colonies the French are spending\r\nless than we are in the work of administration. In some of them they\r\nare nevertheless spending more in public works, and before long their\r\nexpenditure in that respect will in the aggregate far exceed ours. It\r\nwill suffice to give one or two instances in support of these general\r\nstatements.\r\n\r\nThe position of Dahomey is particularly interesting, because it adjoins\r\nLagos, because Lagos is one of the transit ports for Dahomey, because\r\nboth Colonies are building a railway in the same direction, and because\r\nboth Colonies aim at capturing the bulk of the interior trade. Compared\r\nwith Lagos, Dahomey is, of course, only an infant in years, but an infant\r\nof sturdy growth. Its trade has jumped from nineteen million francs in\r\n1893 to twenty-seven million francs in 1900. The growth in its export\r\ntrade is very noticeable. In 1893 it amounted to £347,258 (8,681,463\r\nfrancs), and in 1900 had grown to £502,350. In 1893 the export trade\r\nof Lagos was £836,295; in 1900 it was £885,111. True, Lagos saw better\r\ndays in 1896 and 1899 (£975,203 and £915,934 respectively),[207] but the\r\nratio of increase has not been equal to that of Dahomey. In 1894, on an\r\nexport trade of £821,682, the expenditure of Lagos amounted to £124,819;\r\nin 1900, on an export trade of £885,111 the expenditure was £187,124,\r\nincluding £37,214 for public works and £18,169 on account of public debt.\r\nIn 1900, on an export trade of £502,350 Dahomey spent £119,664, of which\r\n£29,000 in public works, and in 1901 contributed £60,000 from its own\r\nlocal revenue for the railway.[208] In 1900 Dahomey spent £8000[209]\r\nin military and police; Lagos spent £39,095.[210] For some unexplained\r\nreason Dahomey does not export timber, but her exports of palm-oil and\r\npalm-kernels are increasing yearly. Dahomey is now actually exporting\r\nvery nearly as much palm-oil as Lagos.[211] In palm-kernels Dahomey has\r\nnot yet reached the level of Lagos, but is forging ahead, having exported\r\n24,211,614 kilos, or roughly 24,000 tons, in 1901, against 21,986,043\r\nkilos in 1900, and 21,850,982 kilos in 1899. Lagos shipped in 1900-1901\r\nover 47,000 tons of kernels. Some years ago the French, annoyed at being\r\ndependent upon Lagos as the only port of transit for the trade of their\r\nColony (Lagos is connected with Porto Novo, the capital of Dahomey, by a\r\nlagoon, and the facilities of the Lagos route were, and still are, for\r\ncertain classes of goods very much greater owing to the bar service),\r\nconstructed at Kotonu one of the few wharves which exist on the West\r\nAfrican coast-line. This wharf, aided by the duty imposed on the Dahomey\r\ntransit trade _viâ_ Lagos by the Lagos authorities, has succeeded in its\r\nobject, and the bulk of Dahomey’s trade now passes through Kotonu instead\r\nof _viâ_ Lagos. In this way has Lagos, for temporary revenue purposes,\r\nplayed into the hands of her competitors. The Colony is also building a\r\nrailway[212] which is likely to prove a most important undertaking. The\r\nfiscal policy adopted by France in Dahomey since the 1898 agreement,\r\nabolishing the differential tariff for thirty years, has been well\r\ncalculated to bring about the conspicuous advancement observable, and\r\nunless the railway concessionnaire, under his agreement with the local\r\ngovernment,[213] is allowed to interfere in the territories ceded to\r\nhim with the freedom of trade, and with native rights of land tenure,\r\nthe wisdom of Dahomey’s fiscal policy will continue to bear fruit. Most\r\npeople will be astonished to learn that Dahomey taxes her trade, in the\r\nmain, at a lower rate than Lagos, and it is unquestionable that the\r\ncircumstance acts in the former’s favour and to the latter’s detriment.\r\nThere is so much misconception about on subjects of this kind, which\r\nnevertheless have so direct a bearing upon the prosperity and commercial\r\nposition of our West African possessions and of their rivals, that it has\r\nbeen thought advisable to give in the Appendix as complete a comparative\r\ntable as possible of the duties in both Colonies.[214] To that list the\r\nreader may be referred. On all articles but cottons Dahomey charges lower\r\nduty than Lagos. If Dahomey can manage her affairs, and get a surplus\r\nrevenue to boot by charging 2_d._ a pound on tobacco and gunpowder, and\r\n11_s._ 4_d._ and 4_s._ 10_d._ respectively on rock salt and sea salt,\r\nwhy in the world cannot Lagos do the same, instead of charging 8_d._\r\nand 4_d._ a pound on tobacco, 6_d._ a pound on gunpowder, and 20_s._ on\r\nboth classes of salt? The answer is, because the Crown Colony system is\r\ninfinitely more costly than the French system of administration.\r\n\r\nFrance’s oldest Colony in West Africa, Senegal, despite the periodic\r\nravages of yellow fever, against which it is to be hoped science will now\r\nbe in a better position to struggle with success, is in a very healthy\r\ncondition commercially and financially, although rather too dependent\r\nupon a single industry, viz. ground-nut production.[215] Its export\r\ntrade has increased from £517,934 in 1891 to £1,000,000 in 1900; but its\r\nexpenditure, instead of increasing in similar or greater proportion, as\r\nis generally the case with British Possessions; has remained practically\r\nstationary, at about £150,000; while surplus revenues have enabled her\r\nto agree to pay a yearly subsidy of £36,000 for a period of twenty-two\r\nyears to the Western Sudan (Kayes-Niger) railway, from the completion of\r\nwhich she is sure to largely benefit. In the construction of public works\r\nSenegal is easily ahead of any European possession of West Africa. A\r\nrailway 250 kilometres long connects St. Louis, the capital, with Dakar,\r\nthe principal seaport, and the best on the coast. St. Louis, Dakar and\r\nRufisque have all been provided with fresh water. The Faidherbe bridge is\r\na great engineering triumph, and the wharves at Rufisque and Dakar are\r\nwell organised. Surveys for another railway through the Salum district,\r\nwith prolongation to Kayes, are being undertaken, and there is a project\r\non foot for improving navigation on the Senegal River. Senegal seems\r\ndestined to have a brilliant future.\r\n\r\nThe Ivory Coast has come very much to the fore of late as a possible\r\ngoldfield, to rival if not to surpass the Gold Coast. _Le Transvaal\r\nfrançais_ is the title already given to it by enthusiasts. Prospecting\r\nwork is being undertaken, and hundreds of permits have been granted. A\r\ngood deal of secrecy is being observed in connection with the matter,\r\nand a wise check appears to have been kept upon the flotation of bogus\r\ncompanies. There seems to be good ground for believing that auriferous\r\ndeposits exist in considerable quantities, and recent explorations have\r\nrevealed the existence of many old native workings, and even of a mine\r\nactually being exploited by the natives, that of Kokombo in the Baoule\r\ndistrict. Experts think that the Ivory Coast will prove particularly\r\nrich in dredging propositions. The Baoule, Indenie, Attie and Jaman\r\ncountries are reported to be the four districts in the Colony which\r\nwill repay the gold-seekers. Commandant Binger, who has travelled all\r\nover the country, is a great believer in its gold-bearing capacity, and\r\nin Dr. Freeman’s opinion, South-West Jaman is the gold country _par\r\nexcellence_ of the entire region; richer than Ashanti and other portions\r\nof the British Protectorate.[216] At the Paris Exhibition of 1900 many\r\nsamples of auriferous quartz from the Ivory Coast were exhibited, from\r\nKuadikofi, Nangu-Kru, Alepe and Adokoi, and also some specimens of native\r\ngold workmanship from Baoule and Jaman which point to a high degree of\r\nartistic talent on the part of the workmen. Gold dust has been exported\r\nfrom the Ivory Coast for many years, of an average annual value between\r\n1890 and 1897 of £25,000. At present the trade of the Ivory Coast, which\r\nis steadily increasing, is chiefly remarkable for its timber export. The\r\nports of Grand Bassam, Lahou and Assinie are among the most important\r\ntimber-shipping centres on the coast. In 1892 the Ivory Coast exported\r\nmahogany to the value of £23,000; in 1900, to the value of £44,000.\r\nNearly all the mahogany comes to Liverpool, which imported in 1899 from\r\nthe Ivory Coast 4714 logs measuring 2,727,349 cubic feet, and in 1900,\r\n5748 logs measuring 3,697,416 cubic feet. In the old days the Ivory\r\nCoast, the “Elfenbein Küste” of the Germans, was celebrated for the\r\narticle its name implies.\r\n\r\nWriting in 1730, Barbot says that “the inland country affords yearly\r\na vast quantity of fine large elephants’ teeth, being the best ivory\r\nin the world, most of which is constantly bought up along this coast\r\nby the English, Dutch, and French, and sometimes by the Danes and\r\nPortuguese.” In quaint language, he goes on to tell us how important the\r\nivory trade of the Ivory Coast was in those days, and how the natives\r\nprofited thereby. “This great concourse of European ships,” he writes,\r\n“coming hither every year, and sometimes three or four lying together\r\nat anchor in the road, has encouraged the blacks to set so dear a rate\r\non their teeth (_sic_), and particularly on the larger sort, some of\r\nthem weighing two hundred pounds French, that there is not much to be\r\ngot by them, considering the vast charges that commonly attend such a\r\nremote trade.” Barbot describes his own trading operations on the Ivory\r\nCoast, and speaks of having “six large canoes about the ship full of fine\r\nelephants’ teeth, each canoe manned by five or six hands at least—and\r\nall lusty, resolute men.” Quoting some Hollanders, the same author\r\nwrites that “it is scarce to be conceived what a multitude of elephants\r\nthere is about this country.” It is quite clear that in those days ivory\r\nwas practically the only product exchanged by the natives against the\r\niron bars and rings, beads, kettles, cotton, brandy, and other articles\r\nbrought by European traders in their sailing vessels. Now the ivory\r\ntrade has practically disappeared, owing, no doubt, to the extermination\r\nof the elephants in the coastal regions. What small quantity does come\r\ndown for shipment appears to be brought by caravans from the Western\r\nSudan. This disappearance of a trade which was flourishing enough at one\r\ntime to become the synonym of an extensive portion of the West African\r\ncoast-line, is one of those curious facts of which West Africa affords us\r\nso many examples. It seems to me that we have one of the most striking\r\nproofs of the highly developed commercial instinct of the West African\r\nnative, in the circumstance that no sooner has one branch of trade fallen\r\noff than he replaces it by another. No doubt the initiative is not his\r\nown, but the motive power is, and the very adaptability which he displays\r\nin meeting the new demands of commerce affords the clearest indication of\r\nthe progressiveness of his race. Thus in the Ivory Coast; the ivory trade\r\nhas gone, and has been replaced by the oil, kernel, and rubber trade;\r\nand, of quite recent years, by the mahogany trade.\r\n\r\nSo far, the Ivory Coast is the most backward of the French West African\r\npossessions in the shape of public works, although there is a wharf at\r\nGrand Bassam; but a very big scheme is in contemplation including the\r\nconstruction of a harbour and railway, the piercing of the sandbank at\r\nlittle Bassam opposite to the well-known “bottomless pit” so dreaded by\r\nmariners, and the dredging of the Bingerville lagoon. The future of the\r\nIvory Coast would appear to be in good hands, so far as a very efficient\r\nstaff of administrators is a guarantee; M. Clozel and M. Maurice\r\nDelafosse in particular having distinguished themselves of late in\r\nstudying the aboriginal tribes, and in laying the basis of an intelligent\r\nnative policy which, if pursued, will make of that possession a second\r\nFrench Guinea. Just now, however, the military element appears to have\r\nthe upper hand, and there has been a regrettable collision between the\r\nFrench authorities and the powerful Baoules, which has undone the work\r\nof years of pacific endeavour, and which might, in the opinion of those\r\nFrenchmen who know the country best, have been avoided. Archæological\r\ndiscoveries of profound interest have been made in the Baoule country,\r\npointing to former intercourse with a more advanced people, whom M.\r\nDelafosse thinks must have been the Egyptians.[217]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP SHOWING THE LOCALITY AND NATURE OF HARBOUR IMPROVEMENT\r\nSCHEME IN THE IVORY COAST]\r\n\r\nFrench Guinea can serve as a model of what a common-sense, commercial,\r\nsympathetic administration is able to achieve in West Africa; and the\r\nlate Dr. Ballay, its founder and for more than a decade its governor,\r\nwill rank as the best type of Colonial Administrator, a worthy emulator\r\nof his countryman, le Sieur de Brüe, and of our own Sir John Glover. The\r\nstrides which French Guinea has made since its birth in 1889 are really\r\nphenomenal. In 1890, Konakry, the capital, was non-existent. To-day it\r\nnumbers 10,000 inhabitants, of whom some 300 are Europeans. The trade\r\nof French Guinea, which in 1890 only amounted to £300,000, reached in\r\n1899 and 1900 about £1,000,000. It is one of the most cheaply and yet\r\nmost effectively administered possessions on the coast. Its revenue\r\nis buoyant, owing largely to the successful collection of a poll-tax,\r\nand although a railway to Kurussa, on the Niger, is in course of\r\nconstruction, the expenditure is well beneath the revenue. A magnificent\r\ncarriage-road 137 kilometres in length has been built from Konakry to\r\nthe foot of the Futa-Jallon plateau. Its import duties are, with the\r\nexception of one or two articles, lower than in that of its moribund\r\nneighbour, Sierra Leone. On the other hand, there is an export duty of 7\r\nper cent. on rubber and gum copal. Its condition as compared with that of\r\nSierra Leone can best be set forth in tabular form:\r\n\r\n         FRENCH GUINEA IN 1900                 SIERRA LEONE IN 1900\r\n\r\n    Total trade             £962,209   Total trade             £921,017\r\n    Export trade             391,191   Export trade             362,741\r\n    Expenditure              116,699   Expenditure              156,421\r\n\r\n        EXPENDITURE ANALYSED                    EXPENDITURE ANALYSED\r\n\r\n    Public works and railway £57,478   Public works and railway £36,084\r\n    Other expenditure         59,221   Other expenditure        120,337\r\n\r\nIt remains to be said that last year (1901) the export trade[218] of\r\nSierra Leone fell from £362,741 in 1900 to £304,010, reckoning specie,\r\nand from £317,980 to £265,433, excluding specie, the latter figure\r\nbeing the lowest for twenty-one years. At the same time the expenditure\r\nincreased from £156,421 to £173,457, only £91,976 less than the\r\npurchasing power of the Colony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nFRENCH AND BRITISH MANAGEMENT IN WEST AFRICA\r\n\r\n\r\nApart from the belief, which has been dealt with in the previous chapter,\r\nthat France cannot manage her West African possessions successfully,\r\nanother idea appears to be widely entertained. It is said that French\r\nmethods of rule in West Africa are excessively harsh. I cannot find\r\nany evidence to support this view. The records of all the Powers who\r\nhave possessions in West Africa are tarnished by acts of oppression and\r\ninjustice to the native, but I have seen no proof that in this respect\r\nFrance compares unfavourably with either England, Germany, or Portugal.\r\nOn the whole, France’s record is perhaps cleaner than that of most\r\nother Powers. North of the Bights, the portion of West Africa which has\r\nengaged our attention hitherto, I should say the balance of evidence is\r\ndecidedly to France’s credit. That is the opinion of Sir Charles Dilke;\r\nit was the opinion of the late Miss Kingsley, and one or two other\r\ncompetent authorities. Speaking in September of last year at a meeting\r\nof the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, an African of the Africans, and a\r\ndistinguished scholar, Dr. Blyden, who has had exceptional facilities for\r\njudging, and who, withal, holds an official position under the Sierra\r\nLeone Government, made a striking reference to the subject.\r\n\r\n“France,” said Dr. Blyden, “has a peculiar work to do for Africa—a\r\nwork much needed and suited to the genius of the Celtic race.... The\r\ncontribution of the French to the civilisation of Africa evidently\r\nsprings not only from what they have in common with all mankind, but\r\nfrom what is special to themselves. France is France. England is\r\nEngland. France can do for Africa what England cannot do, and England\r\ncan do for Africa what France cannot do. This all thinking Africans\r\nrecognise, and all gladly co-operate with each nation according to the\r\nmeasure in which their systems agree with native ideas and customs\r\nand traditions. And there seems to be more of conformity in the\r\nFrench methods than in the more rigid and unimaginative system of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon. Whatever there is among the natives of original, racy, or\r\nromantic interest is not perishing under French administration.”\r\n\r\nThat is a true saying, and it goes far towards explaining the political\r\nsuccess of the French in West Africa.\r\n\r\nIt is surely a circumstance which should impress us that the French have\r\nbeen able to successfully apply direct taxation in their possessions\r\nwithout bloodshed or disturbance, while in Sierra Leone we have failed so\r\ndisastrously. As direct taxation in West Africa is a problem fraught with\r\ngreat danger, one needing the utmost care and discrimination, it seems\r\nworth while to give more than passing notice to what has already been\r\ndone by the French and ourselves in the matter. A poll-tax was applied in\r\nFrench Guinea in 1897. In 1900 it yielded £90,000, and I am informed on\r\ngood authority that the returns for 1901 will reach £140,000, and will\r\nstill further increase, as the taxable radius has not yet been reached.\r\nIt has been peacefully collected. Was this the result of overwhelming\r\nmilitary strength? Not at all, for although French Guinea is now about\r\nthree times the size of Sierra Leone, the military, or rather the police,\r\nforce of the French Protectorate is just a little over half what it\r\nis in Sierra Leone. The “show of force” theory has, therefore, been\r\nconspicuous by its absence. It has been replaced by a plentiful supply of\r\nimagination, plus the appreciation of certain scientific facts. What, in\r\nthe first place, are the scientific facts? The tax in French Guinea is\r\na poll-tax, the tax in Sierra Leone is a property-tax. In the one case\r\nthere was no interference with native land tenure; in the other there\r\nwas indirect interference with native land tenure. Mr. Chamberlain[219]\r\nhimself was “disposed to think that the natives saw in the tax an attempt\r\nto interfere with their property.” Yet Mr. Chamberlain has maintained\r\nthe tax. Farther on Mr. Chamberlain says, “that the aversion of the\r\nnatives to the payment of the tax is not insuperable may be inferred\r\nfrom the fact that a similar tax is levied without difficulty from\r\nsimilar races by the French in the neighbouring territory.” There Mr.\r\nChamberlain showed that he was not properly informed. The tax was not\r\na “similar” tax, and the “races” in French territory are not “similar”\r\nbut dissimilar. What ethnic similarity is there, for instance, between\r\nthe Fulani, the ruling race in a large portion of French Guinea, and the\r\nMendi, Timini, Konnos and Sulimas of Sierra Leone? Such confusion is\r\nextraordinary. The peoples of French Guinea are either Mohammedan, or\r\nfor the most part inured to direct taxation for many centuries past by\r\nMohammedan conquest.[220] The peoples of Sierra Leone were independent\r\nraces, who have beaten back every attempt at Mohammedan conquest, and\r\namong whom a regularly recurring impost is unknown, and contrary to\r\nall native ideas. An almost identical argument has been made use of in\r\nregard to the Gambia. We collect a hut-tax in the Gambia; why not in\r\nSierra Leone? For the same reason that what may be sound in one place is\r\nnot sound in another. You cannot lump West Africa together and evolve\r\nidentical legislation for the whole! The passion for assimilation is\r\nfatal to good government in West Africa. The peoples of the Gambia are,\r\nagain, either Mohammedan or have undergone conquest by Mohammedans. The\r\ncase of the Gambia, moreover, is in another sense quite different from\r\nSierra Leone. Sierra Leone is covered with dense forests. Gambia is a\r\nsmall strip of territory on either bank of a river. The villages along\r\nits shores can be raked by gun-boats. Every part is easily accessible,\r\nand on the other side of the border the French are in occupation. What\r\nchance is there of resisting Government demands, even though the tax were\r\nbitterly opposed, which is not the case for the reasons already given;\r\nalthough the Gambia natives are probably no more in love with it than\r\nwe are with our income-tax? Direct taxation is ever unpopular; among\r\nprimitive peoples particularly so. Finally, the natives of French Guinea\r\nare much richer than those of Sierra Leone. So much for the scientific\r\nfacts. Is it not about time that the Colonial Office took over the\r\nservices of a trained ethnologist, or created independent native councils\r\nin West Africa in touch with the Administration?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUSU CHIEF AND STAFF]\r\n\r\nDahomey and Ashanti also offer a parallel in another way. In Dahomey\r\nthe poll-tax was applied for the first time since the Conquest (1892)\r\nin 1899. It yielded £8200 in 1899 and £22,290 in 1900. There has been\r\nno trouble, and as in French Guinea, the tax has not prevented a\r\nsteady increase in the export trade, notwithstanding the thousands of\r\nable-bodied men employed on the railway. In both Dahomey and Ashanti\r\nthe people taxed are Negroes, and were formerly subject to an unusual\r\nstate-form in West Africa, viz. a despotism. They have been conquered,\r\nand conquest implies a tacit right to levy an impost. But conquest\r\ninvolves great hardships on the conquered in West Africa. Villages and\r\ngranaries are destroyed, crops burnt, acres of land laid waste; many of\r\nthose who would be sowing and reaping and gathering produce have been\r\nkilled, and general distress ensues. That is the time for the conqueror\r\nwith his higher culture, and the lofty ideals of the religion he\r\nprofesses, to take the conquered by the hand and try to renovate what he\r\nhas shattered, but on better lines; to act, since he chooses to call the\r\nNegro a child, as a parent, who, after administering castigation, makes\r\nfriends once more with the offender. Put differently, every assistance\r\nshould be given, and due latitude allowed to a tribe which has been so\r\nunfortunate as to incur the wrath of the superior people, whose reforming\r\nzeal is nothing if not drastic. The French gave the Dahomeyans seven\r\nyears’ breathing space before they taxed them.[221]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASHANTI FIELD FORCE AT CAPE COAST _EN ROUTE_ FOR KUMASI]\r\n\r\nWhat has been our action in Ashanti? No sooner has a desolating war been\r\nended, a war attended by certain incidents which do not reflect credit\r\nupon us as a nation; a war which was caused by a series of official\r\nblunders of the grossest kind, than we clap on direct taxation, and\r\nin such a form that a premium is put upon future troubles. In fact,\r\nshortly after this taxation was announced to the beaten chiefs, yet\r\nanother rising was only averted by the prompt despatch of more troops\r\nto Kumasi.[222] Could anything less imaginative—to put it mildly—be\r\ndevised than this application of a war indemnity nearly thirty years old,\r\nprevious non-payment of which was made the excuse for the arrest and\r\ndeportation of Prempreh and the annexation of the country; and when the\r\nrevival of the claim by the authorities in 1900 is admitted to have been\r\none of the contributory causes of the last rising? As Sir William Geary\r\npointed out in 1900:\r\n\r\n    “To take a metaphor from private property, one cannot foreclose\r\n    a mortgage, receive the rents and profits of the land, and then\r\n    beyond that ask for interest on the debt when one has helped\r\n    oneself to payment. We annexed Ashanti in 1896, and not only\r\n    have we obtained formal sovereignty, but the matter has turned\r\n    out a good bargain for us. We are carrying away the natural\r\n    gold of the country for the benefit of European shareholders.\r\n    Now we want to tax the natives.”\r\n\r\nIs policy of this kind calculated to bring prosperity to British West\r\nAfrica? In 1864 the _Times_ expressed itself as follows with regard to\r\nthe ruler of Ashanti:\r\n\r\n    “Instead of harbouring culprits against his crown, instead of\r\n    disregarding the treaties between himself and us, instead of\r\n    trying to sap the foundations of his throne, we should strive\r\n    to cultivate acquaintance with him by the tranquil arts of\r\n    trade. At the back of his vast dominions, receding to the foot\r\n    of the Kong mountains, reside natives who owe and yield him\r\n    obedience. What benefits might be showered on the Protectorate\r\n    if we would set our heads together to foster and consolidate an\r\n    intercourse based on amity and on the extension of legitimate\r\n    traffic!”\r\n\r\nWise words, excellent precepts. Why does not the _Times_ preach them now\r\nfor application in other parts of West Africa, where the Crown Colony\r\nsystem has not yet quite succeeded in undoing the work of generations\r\nof peaceful, commercial efforts? If there be still life left in this\r\nmiserable residue of the once powerful Ashanti nation, no doubt but\r\nthat more trouble arising out of the tax will ensue. It does not seem\r\nas though the contingency were looked upon as altogether remote even\r\nin official eyes, and there are some significant passages in the last\r\nBlue Book on the subject. Happily at present we have an excellent\r\nresident at Kumasi in the person of Captain Donald Stewart, a man of\r\nbroad sympathies, and it may be that his personal influence will prevail\r\nagainst the slumbering discontent which the policy of his chiefs renders\r\ninevitable in the country, whether it be given open expression to or\r\nnot.[223]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RETURN OF ASHANTI FIELD FORCE]\r\n\r\nThere is a passage in the evidence of one of the European witnesses\r\nbefore Sir David Chalmers, in the course of the inquiry into the hut-tax\r\nwar, which explains better than anything else perhaps the difference\r\nbetween the procedure of the French in Guinea and that of the British\r\nauthorities in Sierra Leone. “They are not so particular there. The\r\ngreat man Alimami Dowla is supposed to collect the tax, and he brings\r\nthe money to the Governor and says, ‘This is what I have been able to\r\ncollect,’ and the Government say, ‘Thank you.’” That is precisely what\r\nthe French have done all through. They have gone to the chiefs as “big\r\nfriend”; explained to them that they required money for the railway,\r\nroads, and so on; pointed out the advantages; asked them to contribute;\r\npresented them with an extremely handsome commission of one-third of the\r\nmoneys collected (in other words, subsidised them) in their respective\r\ndistricts, and “winked the other eye,” so to speak, when the moneys\r\npresented have not equalled the amount due. At the same time the prestige\r\nof the chiefs has been everywhere upheld; the native courts preserved;\r\nvexatious European legal formulas kept out of the country; European\r\nmerchants encouraged to come in, and regularly consulted in the work of\r\nadministration; the numbers of officials restricted; economy practised\r\nin every branch of the service, and military methods tabooed. Result,\r\na magnificent success politically, commercially, financially. Compare\r\nthis with what has taken place in Sierra Leone. We are taking away the\r\npower of the chiefs instead of strengthening it.[224] The hut-tax was\r\noriginally enforced in a hasty, not to say brutal manner. Instant payment\r\nwas demanded. Chiefs were dragged from their villages, treated as felons,\r\nhandcuffed and marched off to gaol under the eyes of their unresisting\r\npeople. The Frontier Police, an ill-disciplined force[225] recruited from\r\nthe dregs of the Protectorate, committed all sorts of abuses, and, to use\r\nthe words of the Royal Commissioner, “oppressive severity” was exercised,\r\nand this most delicate business was approached in a general spirit of\r\n“imperious and uncompromising force.” A rising very naturally ensued\r\nwhich convulsed the whole Protectorate. Sir David Chalmers’ subsequent\r\nreport, which condemned the hut-tax and recommended its withdrawal, was\r\nnot acted upon; the hut-tax has been maintained, and an expensive civil,\r\nmilitary and magisterial _régime_ set up, unsuited to the country and\r\nbeyond its power to maintain. Result, the expenditure has risen to about\r\n60 per cent. of the producing power of the Colony, which is steadily\r\ndecreasing; and the up-keep of the machinery to collect the tax costs\r\nmore than the tax produces. The Colonial Office, which exhausted itself\r\nin ingenious explanations to disconnect the rising with the hut-tax,\r\nhas recently issued an optimistic statement—on top of many others of a\r\nsimilar kind—containing the report of the new Governor’s tour in the\r\nhinterland.[226] It seems that everything is for the best in the best\r\nof all possible worlds. The natives are delighted with everything, the\r\nhut-tax included. The fall in the exports (the true test of prosperity\r\nof a West African colony), which have been on the downward grade since\r\nthe hut-tax was introduced, and were lower last year than they have been\r\nfor twenty years (the year of the rebellion excepted), is accounted for\r\nby “want of activity on the part of native producers,” and to the action\r\nof the French. With regard to the latter, the French have for many years\r\nlevied a tax upon native caravans crossing the frontier, and the rapid\r\ndevelopment and the judicious management of French Guinea have killed the\r\ntransit trade which used to pass _viâ_ Freetown, and is now concentrated\r\nat Konakry. Yet, in view of French competition, the authorities deem it\r\npolitic to keep up the tax and all the incidental expenses it involves.\r\nThe caravan traffic with the far interior was doomed when the French\r\nsecured the back country; and the revival of the complaint about taxing\r\ncaravans strikes one as a little insincere for several reasons, and\r\namong them because, although it is natural that the natives of our\r\nProtectorate adjoining the French possession should be sorry to lose\r\nthe profits they derived from the passage of caravans through their\r\ndistricts, and complain accordingly, no evidence has been adduced to\r\nshow that the natives from the remoter hinterlands beyond the frontier,\r\nwhich, be it remembered, belong to France, are desirous of travelling\r\nall the way to Freetown to dispose of their products, when there are\r\nFrench factories quite as near where as good prices can be obtained for\r\nproduce. It is curious, too, to contrast these explanations with other\r\nofficial assurances given out both in 1899 and 1900, that the country\r\nwould soon recover from the hut-tax war and the export trade regain its\r\nnormal dimensions. French competition is no new thing. To conclude, the\r\nexport trade of Sierra Leone twenty years ago is given at £366,000 for an\r\nexpenditure of £72,000: last year the expenditure was £173,457 including\r\nthe railway expenses, and £154,210 minus the railway expenses. The\r\nexpenditure has, therefore, excluding the railway expenses, increased by\r\nover 100 per cent. in the face of a decline in the producing power of the\r\ncountry. That is the road to financial ruin, and those concerned know it\r\nwell enough; but until the British public makes up its mind to seriously\r\ntackle these West African questions, the few who say so will, no doubt,\r\ncontinue to be looked upon as pessimists, “sentimental theorists,” or\r\nfools, until the inevitable day of reckoning comes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE CONCESSIONS _RÉGIME_ IN FRENCH CONGO\r\n\r\n    “What is important in colonial matters is that the Governments,\r\n    in their difficult and uncertain, but systematic, march, should\r\n    have increasingly before them the ideal which they proposed to\r\n    themselves, and which they never lose sight of in the darkest\r\n    nights, the star which shines in the heavens, and of which the\r\n    beams are justice and humanity.”—M. DÉCRAIS, Colonial Minister\r\n    in the Waldeck-Rousseau Cabinet.\r\n\r\n    “We even think that on account of the difficulty, of the\r\n    impossibility, in which the natives find themselves of making\r\n    known their feelings and expressing their grievances, the\r\n    interests of those natives should be the object of special\r\n    kindness and solicitude....\r\n\r\n    “Can we allow these natives to be subjected to the unbridled\r\n    exploitation, to the economical servitude with which they are\r\n    threatened? The exclusive right which the Concessionnaires\r\n    will arrogate to themselves of buying from the natives\r\n    living upon their concessions at such prices as they, the\r\n    Concessionnaires, choose to impose, the natural products of\r\n    the soil, or the harvest which their labour has produced, is\r\n    but a disguised form of slavery.... In conclusion, we can\r\n    but say that this Concession _régime_ is antagonistic to the\r\n    well-being, to the material and moral progress of our natives,\r\n    and to the responsibilities we have assumed in submitting them\r\n    to our domination.”—“Memorial” of the “French West African\r\n    Company”[227] to M. Décrais.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy one of those extraordinary contradictions of which French history\r\naffords so many curious examples, liberty-loving France, with her\r\nsplendid record in West Africa, having proved her capacity to\r\nsuccessfully manage possessions in West Africa; numbering among her\r\nofficials and merchants connected with West Africa men of the highest\r\nmoral calibre, imbued with humanitarian instincts and earnest advocates\r\nof a sound native policy; has within the last few years sanctioned the\r\ninstitution of a _régime_ of territorial monopolies in the French Congo\r\nwhich has already led to deplorable occurrences, and cannot fail to cause\r\nstill greater evils if permitted to continue. To explain all the phases\r\nof this grave departure from French traditions in West Africa would\r\nrequire a great deal more space than is here available. One can only give\r\nits origin, indicate its main lines and the events which have hitherto\r\ntaken place in connection with it, and briefly discuss how it affects\r\nthe general relationship of Western Europe with Western Africa and the\r\ninterests of British subjects in the maritime zone of the French Congo.\r\n\r\nSome three years and a half ago the huge profits earned by certain\r\nrubber companies, so-called, in the Congo State; the enormous premiums\r\nat which their shares stood on the Antwerp Stock Exchange; the wild\r\nspeculations which anything to do with Congo rubber gave rise to in\r\nBelgium; the colossal increase in the yearly output of rubber from the\r\nCongo State, which from a value of 260,000 francs in 1888 had risen to\r\n15,850,000 francs in 1898,[228] provoked in France—or, at any rate,\r\namong some influential Frenchmen, notably in Government circles—a desire\r\nthat similar results should accrue in the French Congo. “Here,” ran the\r\nargument, “we have an immense territory as rich in forest products,\r\nnotably rubber, as the Congo State, which is doing very little, which\r\nfor years has been a drag upon the metropolis; while the Belgians—these\r\nnew-comers in Africa, these tyros at tropical colonisation—are making\r\nfortunes every day. Why cannot we imitate them?” The feeling was\r\nthoroughly natural. Those who entertained it, however, forgot four\r\nthings—three of which may at this stage be referred to—or, if they did\r\nnot forget them, they at all events brushed them aside in the enthusiasm\r\nof the moment. They forgot the causes which had led to the comparative\r\nstagnation of French Congo on the one hand and the causes which were\r\nmoulding a state of prosperity in the remaining French Colonies on the\r\nother. They forgot the political ambitions of the astutest diplomatist in\r\nEurope—the Sovereign of the Congo State. They forgot _how_ the inflated\r\npremiums, colossal profits, and the exaggerated production had been and\r\nwere being brought about. If the latter point did present itself to the\r\nminds of a minority, it was assumed that, under a French administration,\r\nabuses such as those known to exist in the Congo State were impossible,\r\nand that results in every sense equal to those obtained in the Congo\r\nState could be secured in French Congo without them. Swayed by these\r\nconsiderations, the French Government and French Colonial public, with\r\nthe exception of a handful of far-seeing and experienced men, sought to\r\ncarry out the new programme without delay.\r\n\r\nKing Leopold foresaw at once the danger and the opportunity; the danger\r\nif a sudden influx of French capital into French Congo should lead to the\r\nconstruction of a railway from the French coast-line to Brazzaville on\r\nthe Upper Congo, to threaten the monopoly of traffic with the interior\r\nenjoyed by the Matadi-Stanley Pool railway; the necessity of averting it\r\nby placing the financial control of the French concessions in Belgian\r\nhands, whereby the construction of such a line could be delayed _ad\r\ninfinitum_; and the double advantage of (1) fostering the movement in\r\nFrance, on account of the increased railway freight the development of\r\nthe movement would bring for the existing Belgian line, to say nothing\r\nof the increased customs duties on goods and material for the French\r\nUpper Congo (whose only practical route was, of course, _viâ_ Congo\r\nState territory), which would accrue to the Congo State for the same\r\nreason; and (2) of securing for the small but influential Belgian group\r\nof which he is the supremely able leader a preponderating position in\r\nthe possessions adjoining his own.[229] Gathering his financiers and\r\nco-partners in that vast Trust—which is called the Independent State\r\nof the Congo—King Leopold flung himself into the breach, and with such\r\ngood effect that French Congo was in an incredibly short space of time\r\npartitioned on paper into some forty odd concessions of all shapes and\r\ndimensions, with nominal French heads, but with Belgians on the board of\r\nadministration, a majority of Belgian shareholders behind, with Belgian\r\ncapital either openly or in disguised form the controlling factor, with\r\nstrings pulled in Belgium, ideas borrowed from Belgium, Belgian methods\r\nof tropical African development and Belgian methods of rigging the home\r\nmarkets writ large all over them.[230] With what consummate skill the\r\nSovereign of the Congo State weaved his nets, flung them forth and\r\nlanded his fish, only those who have had a glimpse of what has gone\r\non behind the scenes can describe. It would make a curious story, and\r\nnot an altogether savoury one, and perhaps some day it will be fully\r\ntold.[231] The clever manipulating tactics of the king were only equalled\r\nby the infatuation, the heedlessness, the utter want of reflection which\r\ncharacterised the action of the French Government of the day and the\r\nnoisiest section of the French Colonial party. A policy involving the\r\nmost far-reaching consequences was suddenly adopted with, as a French\r\nwriter of distinction has said, “une insouciance, une désinvolture\r\npresque criminelles.” Seemingly hypnotised, France plunged headlong\r\ninto an abyss whence she is vainly seeking to emerge, and in which she\r\nhas already soiled her hands, and as De Brazza rather nobly puts it,\r\n“compromised her dignity.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the French Congo Concessions are in being, and what has\r\nbeen the outcome up to the present after more than two years of the\r\nexperiment? The promoters have done excellently well. Floating their\r\nconcessions at absurd premiums on the Antwerp market, and coming on\r\nthe crest of the rubber wave, they were able—not in all cases perhaps,\r\nbut generally—to dispose of their holdings at substantial profits. The\r\nshareholders who imitated their example showed prescience, for, with the\r\nexception of two companies, there has not been one single transaction\r\nthis year in the shares of forty-three of these companies which are still\r\nquoted in the Antwerp financial and Congo organs! Their paper, in fact,\r\nis unsaleable. Several of the companies have fizzled out. Those who\r\nhave not been allowed to prey on the legitimate barter trade existing\r\nin the Maritime Zone are in more or less of a moribund condition, and\r\nafter squandering their shareholders’ money have accomplished absolutely\r\nnothing. But what of the effect upon the country? Free trade in the\r\nMaritime Zone has disappeared, and with it the revenue it supplied to the\r\nAdministration. The export trade has actually decreased. The finances are\r\nso gravely compromised that a loan of 10,000,000 francs is spoken of,\r\nand at one period last year there was not even available in the local\r\ntreasury sufficient cash to pay the salaries of officials. All public\r\nworks and improvements of any kind are, of course, suspended. The local\r\nCourts are kept busy with endless litigation between Concessionnaire\r\nCompanies who accuse one another of poaching upon their respective\r\npreserves, the boundaries of none of which have, by the way, ever been\r\ndelimited. There have been two native risings attended with considerable\r\nloss of life and destruction of property, and chaos reigns supreme. The\r\nParis Colonial organs are filled with suggestions, exhortations, threats,\r\nrevilings, but with the solitary exception of one Deputy[232]—M. le\r\nComte d’Agoult—and a handful of courageous journalists, such as M. Jean\r\nHess, the African explorer, and M. Serge Basset, of _La Revue_, no one\r\nof note in French Colonial circles has boldly tackled the subject, gone\r\nto the root of it, or preached the only possible solution. The fact that\r\nthe affair has raised an international problem—or rather two—of great\r\ndelicacy, may have something to do with the unwillingness to come to\r\nclose quarters displayed by the leading organs of the French Press. But\r\nit is lamentable, in every sense of the word, that France with all her\r\ngenerous instincts should be able on this occasion to record but very few\r\nprotesting voices against the fatal reversal of the wise and just native\r\npolicy she has hitherto pursued in the main, and with such conspicuous\r\nsuccess, in her other West African possessions.\r\n\r\nFor it is in the relation it bears towards the natives that the\r\nconcession _régime_ in French Congo offers the strongest ground for\r\ncriticism. The saying that “evil communications corrupt good manners”\r\nwas never more applicable than in this case. Once started on the road\r\nmapped out three years ago, subsequent events became inevitable. It\r\nwould have needed a man of iron—and the warmest friends of the ex-French\r\nColonial Minister, who was not the initiator, but the successor to a\r\nheritage of trouble, would not credit him with such proclivities—to have\r\nstemmed the tide and refused, even at the risk of resigning, to allow\r\nhis country to be dragged along the path of reaction towards which the\r\nconcession _régime_ infallibly tended. Step by step the French Government\r\nhas found itself impelled to gravitate nearer to the Belgian conception.\r\nThe Concessionnaires found English and German merchants trading\r\npeacefully with the natives on what they claimed, according to their\r\ncontracts with the French Government, to be their own property. Disputes\r\narose, seizures of produce took place, and it became increasingly urgent\r\nto define the “rights” of the concessionnaires. M. Décrais hung back\r\na long time, but goaded by nearly all the Colonial and some of the\r\ndaily newspapers, with constant pressure brought to bear upon him from\r\ninfluential quarters, he was fain at last to take the leap. He took it,\r\nand through the Governor of French Congo issued a decree (March 20,\r\n1901) as to which one can only say that, if a few years ago it had been\r\npredicted that a French Minister could have framed such a document, the\r\nprophecy would have earned the contemptuous unbelief of all Frenchmen, or\r\nforeigners acquainted with the part played by France in Western Africa.\r\n\r\nThe decree declared that one idea dominated[233] the entire\r\nconcession policy, viz. that the products of the soil belonged to the\r\nconcessionnaires, who alone had a right to dispose of them, the natives\r\nnot being entitled to sell them to any one but the concessionnaires. To\r\ntone down the arbitrary nature of this promulgation, mention was made\r\nof native reserves, where the natives would be free to do what they\r\nliked. But this apparent modification of the absolutism of the decree\r\nis entirely illusory for three reasons: (1) the area of the reserves\r\nwas not delimited, and in view of the enormous difficulty and expense\r\ndelimitation would involve, could not hope to be for many years to\r\ncome; (2) a decision of the local courts had ordained that, pending\r\ndelimitation of the reserves, the reserves were legally non-existent, and\r\nthat the whole country was therefore exploitable by the concessionnaires;\r\n(3) an antecedent ministerial decree had announced that, when the\r\nreserves were delimited, the areas reserved should not include any land\r\nproducing saleable products.[234] Whatever may have been the difficulties\r\nwith which the French Colonial Minister was beset, the issue of the\r\nabove decree cannot in equity be defended. It virtually handed over the\r\npopulation of French Congo to the mercy of European speculators, of\r\nBelgians grown fat on the misery and the degradation of the natives in\r\nthe Congo State. It left the door open to the grossest abuses, the most\r\ncynical outrages against humanity. It let loose the tongues and pens\r\nof all the apostles of force and coercion for Africa. It reduced the\r\nnatives to the level of servants and serfs of the greedy clique which had\r\nfastened its talons in the country, and it strengthened the position of\r\nthe Congo State in Europe.\r\n\r\nSecure in the official recognition of their “rights,” the concessionnaire\r\ncompanies’ next move was precisely what might have been expected in view\r\nof the class of men controlling them. Legitimate commerce having no place\r\nin their calculations, they at once started a “campaign” for the purpose\r\nof forcing the French Government to coerce the natives into bringing\r\nrubber and other forest produce to their factories, on such terms as\r\nthey, the concessionnaires, chose to pay for the labour expended by the\r\nnatives in collecting it. While their subsidised organs daily devoted\r\nreams to prove that compulsion was essential in dealing with primitive\r\npeoples, their agents in Africa hastened, as far as possible, to put\r\nthese principles into practice. Arms of precision were smuggled into\r\nthe country, and soon the concessionnaires were attempting on a smaller\r\nscale to copy the exploits of their countrymen on the other side of the\r\nCongo River. _Facilis descensus Averni._ The agitation was partly met by\r\nthe application of a hut-tax paid in kind, the produce to be handed in\r\nby the natives to the Government authorities, who would dispose of it\r\nto the concessionnaires at a nominal price; thus giving an appearance\r\nof legality to the transaction, and disguising coercion in the garb of\r\nadministrative requirements. The Government having accomplished nothing\r\nwhatever in the way of bettering the country, improving communication,\r\nor constructing public works from which the natives might be expected to\r\nderive some benefit, the hut-tax was naturally resented; its application\r\nin French Congo being, moreover, scientifically unsound, and only\r\nfeasible of accomplishment by a long course of preparation. Grafted upon\r\nthe action of the concessionnaires, the measure was followed by outbreaks\r\nin various directions, especially among the warlike Fans of the Ogowe and\r\nthe Upper Sangha people.\r\n\r\nThis new step on the part of the French Government stirred up for a time\r\nthe opponents of the concessionnaire _régime_ in France. De Brazza sent\r\na memorable protest to the _Temps_. Its concluding passage is well worth\r\nquoting:\r\n\r\n    “France has assumed a duty towards the native tribes (of French\r\n    Congo) who for twenty-seven years have lent their assistance\r\n    in the work of expansion. These people have received from us\r\n    the seal of their future liberties.... We must not sacrifice\r\n    them to the vain hope of immediate results by thoughtless\r\n    measures of coercion opposed to the generous ideas which our\r\n    flag personifies. We should be committing a great mistake to\r\n    discount that result, by enforcing at the present time taxes\r\n    upon the products of the soil, or by compelling the natives to\r\n    work in the form of forced labour or military service. It would\r\n    constitute a great blow to our dignity if such labour and such\r\n    taxes were converted into a sort of draft-to-order in favour of\r\n    the concessionnaires.... It is to recall these considerations\r\n    to men’s minds, and to avoid the moral bankruptcy to which\r\n    economic and financial disasters may lead us, that I have\r\n    emerged from the reserve I had imposed upon myself.”[235]\r\n\r\nJust then, too, one of the very few genuine French concerns among the\r\nconcessionnaire companies, managed by a Frenchman distinguished for his\r\nexplorations in the country, M. Fondère, wrote publicly to the Colonial\r\nMinister, abandoning his concession:\r\n\r\n    “Experience has convinced us,” he wrote, “that, notwithstanding\r\n    any modifications of detail which your department might\r\n    suggest, either in the administrative organisation of the Congo\r\n    Colony or in the agreement between the Government and the\r\n    Concessionnaires, the exclusive monopoly of the concessions is\r\n    a vain epithet. The right to sell his products to whomsoever\r\n    he may please cannot be denied to the native, because he has\r\n    always possessed it. Moreover, all stipulations to the contrary\r\n    notwithstanding, it would be quite illusory to think of taking\r\n    this right away from the native. That could only be done by\r\n    force of arms.”\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, M. Albert Cousin, also a well-known man in French\r\nColonial circles, who had previously been a warm defender of the\r\nconcessions _régime_, published a pamphlet to the effect that he had\r\nchanged his mind, and was now convinced the experiment was a mistaken\r\none.[236]\r\n\r\nThese repeated blows staggered for a moment the defenders of the\r\nBelgian conception in France. The newspaper which had the most largely\r\ncontributed to influence French Colonial opinion even went so far as to\r\nadmit that it could not but be “very much impressed by the new ideas\r\nwhich are coming to light.” The ideas are not new. They are as old as the\r\nhills. They date back from the time when man, evolving from the brute,\r\nbecame a law-maker, and decided that certain fixed principles of morality\r\nshould form the basis of social order.\r\n\r\nThat temporary hesitation offered a great opportunity for French\r\nstatesmanship, but no one came forward to enforce the lesson. And so the\r\npowerful influences which had been at work from the first set themselves\r\nto destroy the “impression” created. They partially succeeded, but they\r\ncould not destroy it altogether, and I rather fancy it is becoming more\r\npronounced and will eventually carry the day. One factor, at any rate, is\r\nlikely to assist its growth not a little—the extravagant demands of the\r\nconcessionnaires and the violent attacks on the French Government on the\r\npart of the Belgian organs devoted to the interests of their compatriots\r\nin French Congo. The institution of the hut-tax was merely a sop. It\r\nstaved off the clamour for a time, but in the nature of things could not\r\nlast for long. To feed the army of concessionnaires with the proceeds\r\nof a hut-tax an army of native levies is required. That is what the\r\nconcessionnaires claim must be organised, and once more the same strings\r\nare being pulled, the same arguments put forward, the same machinery set\r\nin motion. The French Government must do what the Congo State has done.\r\nIt must raise 15,000 or 20,000 men, arm them with weapons of precision\r\nand turn them loose upon the population in order to enforce a tribute\r\non the yield of which the concessionnaires shall not only live but run\r\ntheir shares up to high premiums, present respectable dividends to their\r\nBelgian holders, and generally make money at the expense of the natives\r\nof the French Congo, using the French Government as a sort of decoy-duck\r\nthe while. I doubt if it will work. I fancy King Leopold and his friends\r\nare going rather too far. But one thing at least is certain. Either the\r\nconcessionnaires, who know nothing of trade and are not concerned with\r\nmere matter-of-fact commercial considerations, who have never looked\r\nupon commerce as an element in their “business,” will themselves be\r\ncompelled to throw up the sponge; or they will compel in one shape or\r\nanother the French Government to give them physical means to establish\r\nslavery in the French Congo, as it has been established in the Congo\r\nState. To suppose the latter is almost an impossibility, notwithstanding\r\nall that has happened, and it is perhaps not displaying too great an\r\noptimism to hope that the concession _régime_ in French Congo may perish\r\nfrom its own internal corruption. Meanwhile it remains to be seen how\r\nthat _régime_ has affected and continues to affect British interests,\r\nand the part it plays in the international situation created by the\r\nproceedings of the Congo State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL INTERESTS AND MONOPOLY\r\n\r\n    “As to the ground on which we contend for the rights we have in\r\n    the interior of Africa, they have really been our own guiding\r\n    principles throughout. _It is not territory, it is freedom\r\n    of trade_, and on that ground we are strong and shall do our\r\n    very utmost.”—Extract from a speech by LORD SALISBURY to a\r\n    deputation of Chambers of Commerce, 1898.\r\n\r\n    Speaking at Manchester in 1884, Sir H. M. Stanley prophesied,\r\n    as a result of the creation of the Congo State, an export\r\n    of British cotton goods to the Congo State of £26,000,000\r\n    annually. According to the same speaker, one firm on the Congo\r\n    River alone imported, in 1879, British goods to the value\r\n    of £185,000. After seventeen years’ existence, the _total_\r\n    imports of British goods to the Congo State is far below that\r\n    figure—viz. £133,200 in 1901!\r\n\r\n    The importance of British trade interests in French West\r\n    Africa may be estimated from the fact that in 1900 the French\r\n    possessions absorbed British goods to the value of £709,900,\r\n    and sent £534,727 of produce to British ports.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _cahier de charges_ or agreements between the French Government\r\nand the Concessionnaire Companies the latter were held to respect the\r\n“acquired rights of third parties,” and the “general rights created by\r\nthe Berlin Act.” Who were the “third parties”? What were their “acquired\r\nrights?” What were the “general rights created by the Berlin Act”?\r\n\r\nWhen in the early part of the nineteenth century the European nations\r\nput a stop to the export slave trade, Great Britain, having led the way\r\nin securing this reform, entered into treaties with most of the chiefs\r\nand head-men along the West Coast, giving some of them subsidies and, by\r\nmeans of consular and naval visitations, encouraging them to give their\r\nattention to the gathering of their forest products for sale to Europeans\r\nin exchange for the merchandise of Europe. In this way the trade in\r\npalm-oil was stimulated in the Niger Delta and Windward Coast; whilst in\r\nGaboon it took the shape of barwood, ebony and ivory, and in the River\r\nCongo palm-oil and ivory. At that time there was no European Government\r\nestablished on the African coast between the Gold Coast and Ambriz. The\r\nEuropeans who settled along the coast traded from their vessels. After\r\nthe introduction of steam, the European traders (chiefly British) traded\r\nin hulks in the Niger Delta, and built houses and stores at various\r\npoints along the whole coast-line down to Ambriz. Small sailing vessels\r\nplied between these trading places and the terminus of the ocean steamers\r\n(then Fernando Po, or Cameroons), and sailing vessels from Europe sailed\r\nregularly to and fro, bringing their goods and taking home their cargoes\r\nof vegetable and animal products. Soon after the establishment of steam\r\nthe French Government made a treaty with the chiefs of the Gaboon River,\r\nby which ground was ceded for a coaling station for the French men-of-war\r\nthen plying on the African coast to put down the foreign slave trade.\r\nShortly afterwards, an American citizen established in Fernan Vaz\r\ndiscovered a vine, of which the sap, when exposed to the atmosphere, was\r\nfound to yield india rubber, and in course of time this new industry was\r\nfairly started and gradually spread over the adjoining territory. It was\r\na slow process, but in a few years the gathering of rubber became general\r\nin that part of the coast, and in Gaboon the French naval officers saw\r\nthat there was a trade to be taxed, and forthwith a Custom House was\r\nbuilt and duties placed on imports.\r\n\r\nWhen British merchants first established themselves in Gaboon the\r\npolitical authority of the French Government was confined to the Gaboon\r\nRiver estuary, and the up-river trade was carried on at our merchants’\r\npersonal risk. In order to induce the natives to collect rubber, European\r\ntraders had perforce to let the natives have goods on credit, as those\r\nnatives near the coast had to go far into the interior to buy from other\r\nnatives; who, in their turn, had to be given credit wherewith to buy from\r\nnatives still farther inland, and induce them to seek the vines and make\r\nthe rubber. In this way the credit system, as it exists to-day, was\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\nIn the pursuit of this rubber trade, fostered by British merchants,\r\nthe natives of Gaboon, crossing their country to the South, struck the\r\nOgowe River, which gave them easy access to a wide field from which to\r\ncollect produce. In course of time the European traders followed the\r\nnatives across country, and meeting the river,[237] lost no time in\r\ntracing its course to the sea and at once establishing sea communication\r\nbetween Gaboon and the Ogowe. Their example was imitated by the French\r\nGovernment, and in due course possession was taken by France of the Ogowe\r\nand Fernan Vaz; but when at Berlin the Governments of Europe settled\r\nwho were to become the owners of the Congo and the adjoining maritime\r\nterritories, France had, in point of fact, no political influence south\r\nof Fernan Vaz. This expansion of Gaboon was initiated by British and\r\nGerman enterprise, French white traders coming in after the pioneer\r\nwork was accomplished. When 2° 30´ of South latitude was fixed as the\r\nnorthern boundary of the free-trade zone, it was expected that that line\r\nwould include within it the trade of Sette Camma, the trade of which\r\nwas British and German entirely. The Chambers of Commerce of Liverpool\r\nand Manchester set forth these facts at the time: before the treaty was\r\nmade, and when urging the principle of free trade within the zone fixed\r\nby treaty, no idea was in the mind either of the traders, the Chambers\r\nof Commerce, or the representatives of the various Governments concerned\r\nin the making of the Berlin Treaty, other than that the freedom of\r\ntrade therein referred to applied to the only known trade in existence,\r\nviz. the collection and sale by the natives of the vegetable and other\r\nproducts of their country in exchange for European merchandise. Any\r\nlegislation, therefore, of which the effect is to alienate the rights of\r\nthe natives to collect the produce of their country, and to dispose of\r\nthose products freely to whomsoever they wish, is a direct violation of\r\nthe principles of equitable treatment towards the natives which animated\r\nthe Conference and the rights of the signatory Powers of that Conference.\r\n\r\nIt is then perfectly clear (1) that the “third parties” mentioned in\r\nthe _cahier de charges_ were the European merchants who had created the\r\nexisting trade of the French Congo, the taxes upon which supplied the\r\nlocal administration with funds for purposes of revenue; (2) that the\r\n“acquired rights” of those merchants consisted in the right to continue\r\ntheir trade, the freedom of which was guaranteed under the Berlin Act;\r\n(3) that the “general rights created by the Berlin Act” were, on the one\r\npart, the rights of the natives (“whose moral and material well-being”\r\nthe contracting Powers to the Berlin Act bound themselves to “care for”)\r\nto their land and the produce thereof; and, on the other part, the\r\nrights of each of the signatory Powers to ensure that the principles of\r\nthe Berlin Act were not violated by any one of the parties to that Act.\r\nThe way in which the rights of the natives are “cared for” under the\r\nconcessions _régime_ was dealt with in the last chapter. It remains to be\r\nsaid to what usage the “acquired rights” of the merchants trading in the\r\ncountry have been subjected.\r\n\r\nTwo of the most important firms trading in the French Congo at the time\r\nof the issue of the Decree of Concessions (March 1899) were British.[238]\r\nThey were among the very first to open up the country to trade, their\r\nrepresentatives had always been law-abiding citizens under the French\r\nflag; they had ever worked harmoniously with the French officers, who\r\nfrom time to time had sought their assistance in developing this or\r\nthat district, had asked them to send their native traders into such and\r\nsuch a region, and generally encouraged them in every way to promote\r\nand extend the area of their trading operations. In the course of over\r\na quarter of a century’s trade in the country the British firms had\r\ncontributed large sums to the local revenue, and had cheerfully paid\r\nthe enormous differential customs tariffs levied upon British goods,\r\nthe taxes, the licences, the duties of all sorts affecting the various\r\nbranches of their businesses prescribed by the law of the land. Their\r\nstanding was, of course, well known to the French Government, and in a\r\nsecret letter of instructions[239] communicated to the concessionnaires\r\nby the French Colonial Minister, the former were required to pledge\r\nthemselves “to leave entire latitude for two years to the existing\r\nforeign firms for all the commercial undertakings which they may perform\r\nin the territory conceded” to them; and further, that they should\r\npropose to the said foreign firms at the end of the two years, and in\r\nthe event of difficulties arising with the latter, to buy up their\r\nestablishments. The pledge was duly given. But it was not carried out.\r\nThe French Government, finding itself incapable of compelling obedience,\r\nallowed the matter to slide, and was brought by successive stages in\r\nthe development of affairs to the issue of the Decree of March 26, 1901\r\n(mentioned in the previous chapter), which declared, as has already been\r\nstated, that the products of the soil—that is to say, the only medium\r\nof trade in the country—belonged exclusively to the concessionnaires,\r\nand that the natives were not free to dispose of them to any one but\r\nthe concessionnaires. The “acquired rights of third parties,” and the\r\nrights of the natives, had gone by the board; the rights of England as a\r\nsignatory Power of the Berlin Act had been infringed; and the Act itself\r\nhad been violated in one of its most essential articles, viz. Article V.,\r\nwhich says that “no Power which exercises, or shall exercise, sovereign\r\nrights in the above-mentioned regions shall be allowed to grant therein\r\na monopoly or favour of any kind in matters of trade.”\r\n\r\nTo describe the series of outrages[240] perpetrated by the agents of the\r\nBelgian groups, masquerading as French patriots, upon our merchants which\r\ntook place during the two years that the Concessionnaire Companies had\r\nbound themselves to allow “entire latitude” to the firms trading in the\r\ncountry; the protests of our merchants, who were never informed by the\r\nFrench authorities that their _locus standi_ had become modified; who\r\ncontinued on the one hand to pay customs dues on their imports, licences\r\nfor the factories and native traders, while forcibly prevented, under the\r\neyes of the same authorities and with their tacit assent, from disposing\r\nof their goods to natives against produce; the expostulations of Sir\r\nEdmund Monson, our Ambassador in Paris; the promises of M. Décrais which\r\nwere never fulfilled; the actions at law brought by our merchants at\r\ngreat expense in the Congo to test the legality of the concessionnaires’\r\nproceedings; the deputation of nine Chambers of Commerce to Lord\r\nLansdowne; the upholding of the concessionnaires’ claim by the local\r\ncourts, whose judgments as _Le Temps_ (which has pleaded, together with\r\none or two other French papers,[241] for justice to our merchants) has\r\npointed out, was based not upon law, but upon the Decree of March 1901,\r\nwhich the judges could not go beyond; the persecution of our merchants\r\nby the concessionnaires for purchasing produce from their concessions on\r\nthe strength of the said judgment; the infliction of heavy fines upon\r\nour merchants; the entire stoppage of their trade; the seizure of their\r\nproduce at African ports and even at a French port;[242] the evacuation\r\nof our merchants which is now proceeding; the renewed representations\r\nof British Chambers to the Foreign Office; above all, the unaccountable\r\nlethargy of the British Government,[243] and, with one or two honourable\r\nexceptions,[244] the indifference of the British Press—to adequately\r\ndescribe these things would require a couple of chapters at least.\r\n\r\nThe position to-day is this, that from the greater part of the Ogowe\r\nBasin, which alone is unaffected by the Berlin and Brussels Acts, being\r\noutside the Conventional Basin of the Congo, our merchants have been\r\nexpelled, without a penny compensation. In the Conventional Basin of\r\nthe Congo, where—as in the Ogowe—our merchants have been established\r\nfor upwards of twenty years; where their rights to trade freely with\r\nthe natives are solemnly guaranteed by International Treaties, British\r\nsubjects are being expelled, not only without compensation but with\r\nignominy and insult, after suffering heavy losses; the trade which they\r\nbrought into being ruined, the trading stations they have built deserted,\r\nthemselves arbitrarily removed from regions where they have laboured for\r\nso long.[245]\r\n\r\nIt is a shameful, a discreditable episode. But if it be true that\r\nout of evil good may come, there is still some hope that out of the\r\ntreatment—treatment which to those who know all the details is beyond\r\nthe reach of Parliamentary language to characterise—meted out to British\r\nmerchants in the French Congo may come the liberation of the peoples of\r\nthe Congo State from the Belgian yoke, and an international understanding\r\nbinding upon the Powers whereby a rational, common-sense, and just\r\nnative policy may be mutually agreed upon, and the vast region of the\r\nCongo Basin thrown open to the legitimate commerce of all nations. The\r\nmovement against monopoly based upon force in West Africa; against the\r\nevil which King Leopold has sown; against the follies as well as the\r\nhorrors which that evil has engendered, is growing apace. The expulsion\r\nof British subjects from French Congo may yet serve as the lever whereby\r\nthe edifice of fraud and greed and cruelty reared by Africa’s self-styled\r\n“regenerator” may be overthrown. And the reason is this.\r\n\r\nThe British Government has for years been pressed to inquire into\r\nthe doings of the Congo States upon humanitarian grounds. The German\r\nGovernment, the Governments of the United States and of France have\r\nbeen similarly approached. None of them have taken definite steps in\r\nthe direction desired. The chief reasons in the case of England, France\r\nand Germany are probably three. First, international rivalries in the\r\npartition of Africa and the political ambitions which those rivalries\r\nhave begotten. By a combination of circumstances of which King Leopold\r\ntook full advantage, the Sovereign of the Congo State has been able\r\nto intrigue first with France against England (1892-94), with England\r\nagainst France (1894), with France against England (1897-99). When\r\nthe expedition of Major Marchand—who would never have reached Fashoda\r\nbut for the reinforcements in men, ammunition and stores despatched to\r\nhim over the Congo Railway, through Congo State territory—was seen to\r\nbe a political failure, King Leopold turned fawning upon England, and\r\nattempted to gain our consent to his appropriation of the Bahr-el-Ghazal.\r\nWith his usual astuteness he endeavoured to strengthen his diplomacy\r\nat the Court of St. James by securing, meanwhile, a _fait accompli_ in\r\nAfrica. In this he failed, mainly through journalistic enterprise in\r\nexposing his carefully laid plans (that also, by the way, would make an\r\ninteresting little story). After the Fashoda episode King Leopold was\r\nagain pro-British for a short time, until he became once more France’s\r\ngood friend, and plunged the French Congo into chaos. In the interval\r\nof acting honest broker to England and France alternately, he has tried\r\nto play Germany off against England in sundry matters, such as the\r\nTrans-African railway scheme. So much for international rivalries on the\r\nWestern Central African field, in which the Sovereign of the Congo State\r\nhas held most of the trumps. To these must, of course, be added other\r\nrivalries on a wider field amongst the Powers in question, which tended\r\nstill farther to paralyse all useful, disinterested and combined action\r\nfor humanitarian ends in the Congo. The second reason is dynastic. King\r\nLeopold is connected with the Royal Families of England and Germany.\r\nOnly those who are in Court secrets know the exact extent to which\r\nthe Sovereign of the Congo State has profited by that, to him, happy\r\ncircumstance. It has, undeniably, been considerable. The third reason is\r\nthe self-imposed halo of sanctity with which the public press has been\r\ngulled for years by the happy knack of attributing abuses of a more than\r\nusually flagrant character to individual wrongdoing of agents—a plea used\r\nagain and again with never-failing results. To these reasons—there are\r\nothers, no doubt, and two of them are briefly touched upon in the next\r\nchapter—are mainly due the failure of the Powers to fulfil their duties\r\nunder the Berlin Act _upon humanitarian grounds_.\r\n\r\nBut now an altogether different aspect of the Congo problem has sprung\r\nup. So far the Stokes affair[246] has alone provided what might be termed\r\na _material_ cause of complaint against the Congo State. The effect\r\nof this outrage was modified by renewed international rivalries which\r\noccurred shortly afterwards, and even the subsequent appointment of Major\r\nLothaire as Managing Director in Africa for one of the “Companies” in\r\nwhich the Congo State holds 50 per cent. of the shares, and of which King\r\nLeopold appoints the agents, failed to exercise the influence which,\r\nbut for the international rivalries aforesaid, it would otherwise have\r\nwielded. But the horizon has cleared of late. The scramble for Africa is\r\nover. The Powers are beginning to think seriously of the immense problems\r\nwhich beset them in Tropical Western Africa. And it is precisely at this\r\nturning-point, as it were, in European policy in Western Africa that the\r\nmaterial side of the question has risen. England and Germany have both\r\nin their respective ways been sharply confronted with the Nemesis of\r\ntheir past indifference to the repeated violation of the Berlin Act by\r\nthe Congo State. Germany has seen her ivory trade in German East Africa\r\ndisappear, her protected natives driven out of Congo State territory,\r\nforbidden to purchase ivory or produce of any kind from the natives on\r\nthe Congo side of the German Congo State frontier, because by the laws\r\nof the Congo State every product of the forest, whether vegetable or\r\nanimal—when either is of intrinsic value—belongs not to the native owner\r\nof that forest, whose ownership the State does not recognise, but to the\r\nState itself. England has seen her merchants expelled from the French\r\nCongo by an extension of the system of territorial monopolies involving\r\nabsolute rights over the products of the soil, inaugurated by the Congo\r\nState in 1892. The Belgian conception has thrived upon the Powers’ _non\r\npossumus_. The African cancer has attacked both banks of the Congo, and\r\nwherever spreads the fell disease, liberty, legitimate commerce, free\r\ntrade, alike for white man and black, disappear.\r\n\r\nThe Belgian conception of development in Tropical Western Africa is\r\nobserved a little late in the day to have another side to it. It is not\r\nnow merely an institution for earning dividends and reducing the African\r\npopulation. It stands forth as a menace to all legitimate European\r\ninterests in West Africa. What England and Germany could not agree to\r\ndo when humanitarian considerations alone were in question, they can no\r\nlonger ignore with safety to their interests in Africa. The tentacles of\r\nthe Belgian octopus are flung wider and wider, French Congo, Fernando Po,\r\nthe Muni Territory, Dahomey, the Ivory Coast and South West Abyssinia\r\nare all alike either threatened, or victims to the insidious embrace\r\nwhich breeds death and devastation to the natives of Africa.[247] The\r\ntreatment of our merchants in French Congo has given a fresh impetus, and\r\nan added motive, to the demand of public opinion that the Congo State\r\nshall be called to the bar of international inquiry; for if the expulsion\r\nof British subjects from a region solemnly declared internationally free\r\ncommercial land, necessitates specific action on the part of the British\r\nGovernment in the form of a request for arbitration, which is the line I\r\nhave reason to believe our Government has taken, there remains the larger\r\nquestion behind—the question of the violation of the Berlin Act by the\r\nCongo State, originator of the new African slavery. The Upas-tree has\r\nthrown up a new sucker, and although the fresh growth may be removed,\r\nno permanent good will ensue unless the tree itself be rooted up and\r\ndestroyed. The whole scheme, the _raison d’être_, the entire future of\r\nEuropean action in Tropical Western Africa is involved in this question.\r\nIf the Governments are still slow in realising it, the people are not.\r\n\r\nThe well-informed press of England and of Germany is unanimous in\r\ncalling upon the British and German Governments to act in combination\r\nfor the suppression of the monopolistic _régime_ in West Africa, and\r\nits fountain-head the Congo State. The German Colonial Society, with\r\nits 32,000 members, has held two great meetings for this purpose, and\r\nhas passed resolutions of the most emphatic kind, and at the same\r\ntime is using its considerable influence to ensure that in the two\r\nCameroons concessions engineered at the same time as the French Congo\r\nconcessions and by the same means, trade shall be unrestricted and the\r\nnative free to dispose of his products, to whomsoever he will.[248]\r\nIn that respect, Germany is trying her best to undo an initial error,\r\ncommitted under false advice, and the full consequences of which are\r\nnow understood. In England, we are witnessing a happy alliance of\r\ngenuine philanthropy, of scientific knowledge, and of commerce united\r\nin a common aim, testifying to the fact that there never has been a\r\nquestion of African politics where morality and practicability are so\r\nclosely entwined,[249] and if the British Press as a whole still lags\r\nbehind, it is only fair to remember that England has but just emerged\r\nfrom a great war which has absorbed for three years the energies of\r\nthe country. Indeed, when all the circumstances are considered, we\r\nshould perhaps be thankful for the amount of attention which the Press\r\nhas given to the subject, while maintaining the view that, in the\r\nspecific matter of the treatment of our merchants in French Congo, it\r\nhas displayed singular lack of foresight. In the United States signs\r\nare not wanting that the special responsibility incurred by America,\r\nwhich first recognised the International _status_ of the International\r\nAfrican Association—subsequently the Congo State—is beginning, now\r\nthat the policy of the State is better known, to weigh with thoughtful\r\nAmericans, who for many reasons ought not to disinterest themselves\r\nfrom West African affairs; and President Roosevelt has been appealed\r\nto, to co-operate with other of the signatory Powers of the Berlin Act\r\nto bring about a new Conference. It is to be hoped that the appeal will\r\nbe heard. America’s position is such that she can act in this matter\r\nwithout a suspicion of selfish motive, and the importance of her moral\r\nsupport at this juncture cannot be over-estimated. In France, it may\r\nsafely be asserted that the _élite_ of the French official element in\r\nWest Africa is entirely opposed to the monopolistic conception,[250]\r\nthat the most powerful French merchant firms are profoundly and\r\nanxiously antagonistic, and that with few exceptions the best-informed\r\nFrench writers on West African affairs and French local explorers (Mr.\r\nChevalier, for instance) are dead against it. How, then, can we account\r\nfor what has occurred? Very easily, I think. A grave mistake has been\r\ncommitted. It is recognised, not always publicly, on nearly all sides\r\nin France. But the French Government hesitates to admit it, and the\r\nincident of the British merchants intensifies the difficulty. Every\r\nFrench Government dreads the parrot-cry of being too friendly to the\r\nEnglish, and no one knows better than Lord Lansdowne how that permanent\r\nfeature in French politics hampers French statesmen. The influence behind\r\nthe concessionnaires is still strong. They have still the majority of\r\nthe French Colonial Press on their side—for reasons which need not be\r\ntoo closely inquired into; and King Leopold’s personal influence in\r\nGovernment circles (which he takes every opportunity of strengthening,\r\nwitness, for instance, the despatch of a special envoy of welcome to\r\nPresident Loubet on his return from Russia), is still conspicuous,\r\nas every diplomatist in Europe knows. The truth is that the French\r\nGovernment is marking time. The next few months will be crucial ones in\r\nthe history of the concession experiment. The concessionnaires will make\r\na supreme effort to justify their existence, and to force the Government\r\nto raise a large standing army in the Congo to coerce the natives into\r\ncollecting rubber. If they fail, the Government may begin to gently\r\nremind them that they have fulfilled none of the terms of the _cahiers de\r\ncharge_, and if England and Germany can succeed in coming to a definite\r\nunderstanding between themselves and the United States, France may be\r\nonly too glad to fall back upon a joint Conference as the best way out\r\nof the _impasse_ into which her so-called friends, the Belgians, have\r\nplunged her.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that this forecast errs on the side of optimism, and, in\r\nany case, it is but too obvious that the monopolists are very strong\r\nand have great wealth and influence at their back. Meanwhile all those\r\nto whom the continuation and growth of the Belgian conception in Africa\r\nappears as a virulent disease spreading wherever it can obtain a\r\nfoothold, and to be fought without pause or rest, can best be fulfilling\r\nwhat they conceive to be their duty, by throwing more and more light upon\r\nthe proceedings of the Congo State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE CONGO STATE\r\n\r\n    “At the present time the body called the International\r\n    Association—however startling it may appear to you—is\r\n    invulnerable and unassailable. All the armies in the world\r\n    could not reach it. It is impalpable, intangible as air. I call\r\n    it Benevolence, Charity, Philanthropy—the Spirit of Peace,\r\n    good-will to all men—Progress. It is here amongst you to-night\r\n    ... It eludes your armies, it mocks your best efforts; at a\r\n    whisper it has disappeared and you cannot recall it.... The\r\n    founders of the International Association have been called\r\n    dreamers.... Men understand, or think they do, why a George\r\n    Peabody should invest hundreds of thousands in model lodgings,\r\n    or a Josiah Mason in an Institute.... They can understand also\r\n    why an entire nation spent £20,000,000 to free the slaves in\r\n    the West Indies.... Though they understand the satisfaction\r\n    of a sentiment when applied to England, they are slow to\r\n    understand that it may be a sentiment that induced King Leopold\r\n    II. to father the International Association. He is a dreamer\r\n    like his _confrères_ in the work, because the sentiment is\r\n    applied to the neglected millions of the Dark Continent. They\r\n    cannot appreciate rightly, _because there are no dividends\r\n    attaching to it_, this restless, ardent, vivifying, and\r\n    expansive sentiment which seeks to extend civilising influences\r\n    among the dark races, and to brighten up with the glow of\r\n    civilisation the dark places of sad-browed Africa.”—Sir H. M.\r\n    STANLEY at the London Chamber of Commerce, September 19, 1884.\r\n\r\n    “Tous les pouvoirs émanent du Souverain qui les exerce par\r\n    lui-même ou par ses délégués. Il consulte s’il le juge bon le\r\n    Conseil Supérieur siégeant à Bruxelles. Il prend en personne\r\n    les mesures les plus importantes....

WAUTERS, “L’Etat Indépendant du Congo,”\r\n    chap. xxxii., “Pouvoir législatif,” p. 433.\r\n\r\n\r\nLegends die hard. The legend which attributes to King Leopold of Belgium\r\nand the Congo State a philanthropic motive in African affairs is still\r\nalive among us, although not quite to the extent that it used to be. It\r\nwould have died long ago but for two causes, the misstatements indulged\r\nin by two or three well-known Englishmen and the apparent failure of the\r\nBritish Press, as a whole, to comprehend the _fons et origo mali_ which\r\nis raising up such terrible future complications for Europe in Central\r\nAfrica. Upon occasion one is tempted to think—and the supposition\r\nis strengthened by such articles as that which the _Times_ recently\r\ndevoted to the Congo annexation debate in the Belgian Chamber—that the\r\ncurious omission to come to close quarters with the subject proceeds\r\nnot so much from inability to see things as they really are, as from an\r\nunwillingness to criticise the Sovereign of the Congo State himself.\r\nPersonalities are held to be bad form, especially where Royalty is\r\nconcerned. If that be, indeed, the real explanation of the whitewashing\r\nof the Congo State which finds favour in many quarters, there is nothing\r\nto prevent the process from going on indefinitely. I maintain that it\r\nis utterly impossible to arrive at the truth, if the king’s personal\r\nresponsibility in the maladministration of the Congo State is to be\r\nperpetually shelved. Why should it be? The administrative _régime_ of the\r\nState, as M. Cattier has truly said, is an “absolute despotism.” No one\r\nwho is acquainted with that _régime_ believes for a moment that a Van\r\nEetvelde, a Droogmans, a Liebrechts or a Cuvelier exist for any purpose\r\nthan that of carrying out the king’s instructions and superintending\r\nthe routine work which those instructions entail. King Leopold is sole\r\nmaster, and must bear the responsibility for the _sequelæ_ of measures\r\nwhich he himself has initiated and, through his agents, caused to be\r\napplied. The king has openly and repeatedly claimed for himself this\r\nposition before the world. He has posed, and continues to pose, as the\r\nregenerator of the African. He has put it on record, in a letter to\r\nhis agents, that “his only programme is the work of moral and material\r\nregeneration.” He has written of the “results achieved” by the Congo\r\nState as being due “to the concentration of all my efforts in one field\r\nof action.” He has, throughout, loudly insisted upon the purity and\r\nunselfishness of his intentions. Adverse comment has been dismissed by\r\nhim with a loftiness of tone, a simulated consciousness of high purpose,\r\na dignified picturesqueness of expression from which it is impossible\r\nto withhold a meed of admiration, as in the case of a play repugnant to\r\none’s sentiments but yet so excellently rendered that objection to the\r\ntheme cannot blind one to the art of the performers. “My aim throughout\r\nlife has been to find the truth and make the truth known to others. I\r\nhave often been misunderstood and misrepresented, but we must not be\r\ndiscouraged; let us ever go forward in the path of duty, striving to let\r\nthe light shine forth.” It cannot be a subject of complaint on the part\r\nof his Majesty or his Majesty’s friends if, under these circumstances, we\r\ntake the Sovereign of the Congo State at his word; if we recognise that\r\nin the management of the affairs of the Congo State he has adopted to the\r\nuttermost the proud assertion of Louis XIV.: “_L’Etat: c’est moi_”; if,\r\nmaking due note that his declared policy has been the regeneration of the\r\nAfrican Negro—a policy in the execution of which he shuns not publicity\r\nbut only desires light and truth—we judge his acts and the consequences\r\nof those acts from the standpoint he himself has laid down.\r\n\r\nIt is essential for our purpose to give an historical retrospect of the\r\nevents which preceded the General Act of Berlin in 1885.\r\n\r\nOn September 12, 1876, King Leopold held a conference in Brussels to\r\nconsider the best means which could be devised in order to open up\r\nCentral Africa to European civilisation. The “barbarism” of Africa\r\nhad already begun to perturb his Majesty, who was careful to place on\r\nrecord the absolute disinterestedness of his intentions. Addressing the\r\nassembled scientists and explorers,[251] King Leopold spoke thus: “Is it\r\nnecessary for me to say that in inviting you to Brussels I have not been\r\nguided by egotism? No, gentlemen, if Belgium is small, Belgium is happy\r\nand content with her lot, ... but I should be pleased to think that this\r\ncivilising movement had been inaugurated from Brussels.” The outcome of\r\nthis conference was an “International Association for the exploration and\r\ncivilisation of Central Africa.” Its professed objects were exploration,\r\ntogether with the establishment of sundry centres where explorers of all\r\nnationalities might refit. Committees for the collection of funds were\r\nto be established in all the countries represented,[252] and an Executive\r\nCommittee appointed in Brussels to manage the funds. King Leopold, who\r\nfrom the commencement was pursuing his own ends—as he clearly showed\r\nlater—saw to it that the Belgian Committee should be in the forefront of\r\nthe subscribers, and to such good purpose that ere long the Association\r\ncame to be looked upon as a Belgian Organisation.\r\n\r\nThe association first of all directed its efforts towards the East\r\nCoast of Africa; but when Stanley arrived home in January 1878, after\r\nhaving discovered the course of the Congo, the necessity of a change of\r\npolicy became obvious. The king speedily secured Stanley’s services,\r\na “Committee of Studies” for the Upper Congo was formed, and Colonel\r\nStrauch was despatched to the Congo as a representative of both the\r\nassociation and the committee of studies. Meanwhile King Leopold’s\r\nambitions were slowly maturing, and the theory of an African State in\r\nwhich he would be the representative head was already shaping itself\r\nin his Majesty’s mind. In a letter which he wrote to Stanley, Colonel\r\nStrauch suggested the formation “of an independent confederacy of free\r\nnegroes, the king, to whom the conception and the creation of such a\r\nconfederacy would be due, to be president thereof.” “Our enterprise,”\r\ncontinued Colonel Strauch, “does not tend to the creation of a Belgian\r\nColony, but to the establishment of a powerful _negro kingdom_.” This\r\nidea appears to have been sedulously fostered by Colonel Strauch among\r\nthe European traders established in the Lower Congo, with results which\r\nafterwards became apparent. Whether it was put forward as a blind or\r\nnot it is difficult to say. Anyhow, Stanley knocked it on the head.\r\nAbout this time France and Portugal began to evince uneasiness at the\r\nsomewhat exclusive complexion which the association and the committee\r\nwere beginning to assume, and there ensued a long intrigue in which\r\nthe principal actors were Stanley and De Brazza. De Brazza forestalled\r\nStanley on the right bank of the Congo, and Stanley checkmated De\r\nBrazza on the left bank above Stanley Pool. Portugal, whose explorers\r\ndiscovered the Congo’s mouth in 1484,[253] whose treaties with the\r\nnatives undoubtedly possessed greater validity than those concluded by\r\nthe association’s agents, and who still retained commercial interests\r\nin the region, now became thoroughly alarmed, and endeavoured, with the\r\nassistance of Great Britain, to make good her claims. On February 26,\r\n1884, a Convention was signed between Great Britain and Portugal, the\r\npractical effect of which would have been to put a stop to the expansion\r\nof the Association in the interior. The Convention was attacked at home\r\nand abroad; abroad, from various motives, including the fear that Great\r\nBritain’s political influence on the Congo would become paramount; at\r\nhome, because, by the terms of the Convention, the right of Portugal to\r\nimpose a moderate import tariff was recognised, and it was feared that\r\nthis recognition might lead later on to the application of differential\r\ntariffs to which Portugal was wedded, and because the British Chambers\r\nof Commerce and the British Press were deluded as to the real nature of\r\nthe International Association, which represented itself as devoted to\r\nfree-trade principles. The Convention was opposed by European merchants\r\nin the Congo for the same reasons, backed by the belief that the aims\r\nof the Association tended towards the maintenance and strengthening of\r\nnative rule, which the community of mercantile West African interests\r\nwell knows to be the best guarantee of the development of legitimate\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nThe Convention was by mutual consent abandoned. Its abandonment was\r\npreceded by a remarkable event, viz. the recognition by the United\r\nStates of the Association[254] as a friendly State. The king, aided by\r\nStanley, who was still at that time, I believe, an American subject, had\r\nplayed his cards cleverly with General Henry S. Sandford (subsequently\r\none of the two American representatives at the Berlin Conference), and\r\nthe declaration sent by the former to the United States Government, in\r\nwhich he stated that “the International Association of the Congo hereby\r\ndeclares that by treaties with the legitimate sovereigns in the basins of\r\nthe Congo and of the Niadi-Kwilu, and in adjacent territories upon the\r\nAtlantic, there has been ceded to it territory for the use and benefit of\r\nFree States established and being established,” appears to have exercised\r\na considerable influence. The “Free States” appealed to American\r\nsentiment.[255] Needless to say, the one thing that has not been created\r\nin any shape or form in the Congo is freedom either for native States,\r\nor native institutions, or European trade,[256] and how General Sandford\r\ncould have been deceived to the extent of penning the above despatch,\r\nin view of the emphatic manner in which Stanley had rejected Colonel\r\nStrauch’s suggestion in 1878 (which presumably General Sandford had in\r\nhis mind, although six years had passed since it was made), it is hard to\r\nunderstand. The American recognition of the new status of the association\r\nwas followed by Bismarck’s suggestion of a conference of the Powers, in\r\norder to set at rest the rivalries which had arisen in the Congo Basin.\r\nThe conference first met in November 1884, and subsequently in February\r\n1885. Largely influenced by the decision of the United States, the Powers\r\nauthorised their representatives to follow the lead of the American\r\nGovernment, and on August 1, 1885, King Leopold had the inexpressible\r\nsatisfaction of notifying the Powers that the association would be\r\nhenceforth known as the Congo Free State, and himself as the Sovereign\r\nof that State. In this manner was the evolution of King Leopold from a\r\npure philanthropist to the ruler of a million square miles of territory\r\nin Central Africa accomplished. The king, argue his admirers, had come\r\nto see that patriotism was a duty greater even than philanthropy. The\r\npractical had outweighed the ideal. Very well; but as we study the next\r\nstage in this royal metamorphosis, let those who follow us remember\r\nthe memorable words spoken in 1876 before the assembled scientists and\r\nexplorers in Brussels: “Is it necessary for me to say that, in inviting\r\nyou to Brussels, I have not been guided by egotism? No, gentlemen; if\r\nBelgium is small, Belgium is happy and content with her lot.”\r\n\r\nThe Berlin Conference laid it down that no import dues should be\r\nestablished in the mouth of the Congo for twenty years. But in 1890 King\r\nLeopold, alleging the heavy expenses to which he had been put by the\r\ncampaign against the Arabs in the Upper Congo, applied for permission to\r\nlevy import duties. It was the first disillusionment; and the British\r\nChambers of Commerce began to wonder whether their opposition to the\r\nAnglo-Portuguese Convention had not been mistaken. The king’s request was\r\ngranted (the Powers merely reserving to themselves the right to revert to\r\nthe original arrangement in fifteen years), but not without the bitter\r\nopposition of the Dutch, who had very important commercial interests\r\nin the Congo, backed by the British Chambers of Commerce and all the\r\ntraders in the Congo, irrespective of nationality. A representative\r\ngathering was held in London on November 4, 1900, presided over by Sir\r\nAlbert Rollit, to protest against the imposition of import duties and to\r\ndenounce the hypocrisy which attributed to philanthropic motives the\r\ndesire on the part of the Congo State so to impose them. The speakers at\r\nthe meeting drew attention to the strange anomaly revealed by the sight\r\nof a monarch who, having spent certain sums with alleged (and loudly\r\nadvertised) philanthropic motives, now came forward to claim repayment\r\nof those sums, just like an ordinary business man, but a business man\r\nwho, having acquired a vast estate under false pretences, demanded from\r\nthe victims the wherewithal to pay for its management! They quoted with\r\ntelling effect Stanley’s speech at Manchester on October 21, 1884, given\r\non behalf of the association and against the Anglo-Portuguese Convention,\r\nin which he declared that “the £500,000 which it (the association) has\r\ngiven away to the Congo, it gave freely; the thousands of pounds which\r\nit may give annually it gives without any hope of return, further _than\r\na sentimental satisfaction_.” They were able to show that—even then—King\r\nLeopold, notwithstanding his formal assurances to the commercial world\r\nthat the Congo State would never directly or indirectly itself trade\r\nwithin its dominions, was buying, or rather stealing, ivory from the\r\nnatives in the Upper Congo and retaining the proceeds of the sale on the\r\nEuropean market. They proved that, profiting by the silence of the Berlin\r\nTreaty on the subject of export duties, the Congo State had already\r\nimposed taxes amounting to 17½ per cent. on ivory, 13 per cent. on rubber\r\nand 5 per cent. on palm-kernels, palm-oil, and ground-nuts, the total\r\ntaxation amounting to no less than 33 per cent. of the value of the whole\r\nof the trade. Finally, they had no difficulty in demonstrating that, with\r\nall his professed wish to stamp out the slave-raiding carried on by the\r\nhalf-caste Arabs in the Upper Congo,[257] his Majesty was himself tacitly\r\nencouraging the slave trade by receiving tribute from conquered chiefs in\r\nthe shape of slaves, who were promptly enrolled as soldiers in the State\r\narmy.[258] The sincerity of King Leopold’s solicitude for the natives of\r\nAfrica was in other respects appearing in its true colours, _vide_ the\r\nletter of Colonel Williams, a British officer in King Leopold’s employ,\r\nwho, in disgust at the outrages which were taking place on the Congo,\r\ndenounced them to the king. This letter, from which I give the following\r\nextracts, was read at the conference by Mr. Philipps, representing the\r\nManchester Chamber of Commerce. It ran thus:\r\n\r\n    “Your Majesty’s Government has been and is now guilty of\r\n    waging unjust and cruel wars against natives, with the hope of\r\n    securing slaves and women to minister to the behests of the\r\n    officers of your Government. In such slave-hunting raids one\r\n    village is armed by the State against the other, and the force\r\n    thus secured is incorporated with the regular troops. I have no\r\n    adequate terms with which to depict to your Majesty the brutal\r\n    acts of your soldiers upon such raids as these. The soldiers\r\n    who open the combat are usually the bloodthirsty cannibalistic\r\n    Bangalas, who give no quarter to the aged grandmother or the\r\n    nursing child at the breast of its mother. There are instances\r\n    in which they have brought the heads of their victims to their\r\n    white officers on the expeditionary steamers and afterwards\r\n    eaten the bodies of the slain children.”[259]\r\n\r\nThe history of King Leopold’s action in Central Africa between 1876 and\r\n1890 may therefore be summed up as follows. First stage: Inauguration\r\nof a “movement” for the “exploration and civilisation of Africa” from\r\nmotives (so stated) of pure philanthropy, devoid of any shade of personal\r\negotism or ambition on the part of Belgium. The expenditure of a certain\r\nsum of money for this (alleged) intent. The acquisition of a certificate\r\nof high moral purpose. Second stage: The “movement” takes the form of a\r\nState, possibly an “independent confederacy of free negroes,” with the\r\nking as president. This idea is abandoned, and for it is substituted the\r\ntheory of an “Independent State” administered directly by the king and\r\nhis representatives. The theory takes root, and by the Act of Berlin is\r\nconverted into a _fait accompli_. According to this Act, the king becomes\r\nsovereign of the “Congo Independent State,” and undertakes that the State\r\nshall grant no monopoly or privilege in matters of trade, shall watch\r\nover the welfare of the natives and shall not impose any import duties.\r\nFormal assurances are also given to the commercial world that the State\r\nwill not trade on its own account, directly or indirectly. Third stage:\r\nThe State promptly starts trading for ivory in the Upper Congo, and\r\nwages war against the natives by means of a cannibal army, raised from\r\nslaves captured in war and paid by the vanquished as tribute. Its agents\r\nbegin to be accused of shocking treatment of natives. Fourth stage: The\r\nking asks for permission to impose import duties, pleading the expenses\r\nwhich he is incurring in putting down slave-raiding, and the Brussels\r\nConference grants the request.\r\n\r\nIt may, I think, be fairly argued that the “sentimental satisfaction”\r\nwhich in 1884, according to Sir H. M. Stanley, was all that the king\r\nrequired as a reward for his out-of-pocket expenses, had assumed\r\na singularly practical shape in 1890. From a philanthropist to an\r\nivory-trader is a long step.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the Sovereign of the Congo State obtained the acquiescence\r\nof the Powers in the imposition of import duties, which, it is almost\r\nunnecessary to say, enormously strengthened the international position\r\nof the State, than the plans which his Majesty had conceived for the\r\ndevelopment of what was rapidly becoming tantamount to a Belgian\r\npossession, manifested themselves. What were those plans and what were\r\ntheir _leit motif_? So far as the plans are concerned, I will come to\r\nthem later. But their _leit motif_ may be briefly stated now. To those\r\nwho have studied the personality of King Leopold, acceptance of the\r\nphilanthropic claim put forward by that monarch is simply impossible at\r\nany stage of his African undertaking. In any case, the philanthropic\r\nclaim weakened with every year that passed after 1876. The revelations at\r\nthe London meeting of November 4, 1890, definitely exploded it. Whoever\r\nattributed philanthropy to the Sovereign of the Congo State after that\r\nmeeting was foolishly credulous, although he might still be honest.\r\nWhoever, being acquainted with the edicts of 1891 and 1892, from the time\r\nthose edicts were thoroughly known in Europe, that is to say, towards\r\nthe middle of 1892, has endorsed the philanthropic claim must have been\r\nguilty of gross deceit. I would go even farther than this, and say that\r\nsuch persons have been guilty of conniving and inducing the public to\r\nconnive at a crime which has been steadily growing ever since, in the\r\nextent and heinousness of its criminality; a crime for which Europe will\r\nyet pay dearly.\r\n\r\nKing Leopold found himself in 1885 possessed of an enormous territory, in\r\nthe acquirement of which he had expended a certain sum as an investment.\r\nNot being a philanthropist; but, on the contrary, a very shrewd man of\r\nbusiness, his next thought was how to get his capital back—with interest.\r\nBy throwing open the Congo to legitimate commerce; by encouraging and\r\nfacilitating the trade of all nations as he solemnly undertook to do;\r\nby pursuing a common-sense policy towards the natives, the Sovereign of\r\nthe Congo State might have recovered the original capital he had sunk on\r\nthe Congo, and even have realised a fair percentage upon it. At the same\r\ntime he would have laid the foundations of a peaceful and commercially\r\nprosperous colony _for Belgium_, a colony with vast resources, a\r\nmagnificent river system and unlimited future possibilities. That would\r\nhave been true patriotism, and the ends attained might have justified\r\nthe not very honourable means employed. King Leopold preferred to adopt\r\nanother course, which has led him from illegality to violence, and from\r\nviolence to barbarism. The king’s intention all through was to recoup\r\nhimself for his expenditure at the earliest possible moment. So much for\r\nthe _leit motif_.\r\n\r\nThe measures adopted by his Majesty to bring about this desired result\r\nwere as follows: Five months after the termination of the Berlin\r\nConference, King Leopold issued a decree (July 1885), whereby the State\r\nasserted rights of proprietorship over all vacant lands throughout the\r\nCongo territory. It was intended that the term “vacant lands” should\r\napply in the broadest sense to lands not actually occupied by the natives\r\nat the time the decree was issued. By successive decrees, promulgated\r\nin 1886, 1887 and 1888, the king reduced the rights of the natives in\r\ntheir land to the narrowest limits, with the result that the whole of\r\nthe odd 1,000,000 square miles assigned to the Congo State, except such\r\ninfinitesimal proportions thereof as were covered by native villages\r\nor native farms, became _terres domaniales_. On October 17, 1889, the\r\nking also issued a decree ordering merchants to limit their commercial\r\noperations in rubber to bartering with the natives. This decree was\r\ninteresting merely as a forewarning of what came later, because at that\r\ntime the rubber trade was very small. In July 1890, the same year as\r\nthe Brussels Conference, the Congo State went a step farther. A decree\r\nissued in that month confirmed all that was advanced in November of the\r\nsame year by the speakers at the London Conference, held to protest\r\nagainst the imposition of import dues by the State. By its terms King\r\nLeopold asserted that the State was entitled to trade on its own\r\naccount in ivory—the first open violation of his pledges. Moreover, the\r\ndecree imposed sundry extra taxes upon all ivory bought by merchants\r\nfrom the natives; which, since the State had become itself a trading\r\nconcern, constituted an equally direct violation of the Berlin Act, by\r\nestablishing differential treatment in matters of trade. Such were the\r\nplans King Leopold made, preparatory to obtaining from the Powers the\r\npower to impose import duties.[260] Everything was ready for the great\r\n_coup_, which should also inaugurate the fifth stage of his Majesty’s\r\nAfrican policy.\r\n\r\nThe Brussels Conference met. The Powers with inconceivable fatuity\r\nallowed themselves to be completely hoodwinked, and within a year the\r\ngreatest injury perpetrated upon the unfortunate natives of Africa\r\nsince the Portuguese in the fifteenth century conceived the idea\r\nof expatriating them for labour purposes had been committed, and\r\ncommitted, too, by a monarch who had not ceased for fifteen years to\r\npose as their self-appointed regenerator! On September 21, 1891, King\r\nLeopold drafted in secret a decree which he caused to be forwarded to\r\nthe Commissioners of the State in the Ubanghi-Welle and Aruwimi-Welle\r\ndistricts, and to the chiefs of the military expeditions operating in the\r\nUpper Ubanghi district. This decree never having been published in the\r\nofficial Bulletin of the State, its exact terms can only be a matter of\r\nconjecture; but we know that it instructed the officials to whom it was\r\naddressed “to take urgent and necessary measures to preserve the fruits\r\nof the Domain to the State, especially ivory and rubber.” By “fruits of\r\nthe Domain,” King Leopold meant the products of the soil throughout the\r\n“vacant lands” which he had attributed to himself, as already explained,\r\nby the decree of 1885. The king’s instructions were immediately followed,\r\nand three circulars, dated respectively Bangala, December 15, 1891,\r\nBasankusu, May 8, 1892, and Yakoma, February 14, 1892, were issued by\r\nthe officials in question. Circular No. 1 forbade the natives to hunt\r\nelephants unless they brought the tusks to the State’s officers. Circular\r\nNo. 2 forbade the natives to collect rubber unless they brought it to\r\nthe State’s officers. Circular No. 3 forbade the natives to collect\r\neither ivory or rubber unless they brought the articles to the State’s\r\nofficers, and added that “merchants purchasing such articles from the\r\nnatives, whose right to collect them the State only recognised provided\r\nthat they were brought to it, would be looked upon as receivers of stolen\r\ngoods and denounced to the judicial authorities.”\r\n\r\nThus did the Sovereign of the Congo State avail himself of the additional\r\nprestige conferred upon him by the Brussels Conference. He did not\r\nobtain his own way entirely, because the years which had elapsed since\r\nthe Berlin Conference had witnessed the creation of a powerful group\r\nof Belgian trading companies, presided over by one Colonel Thys, who\r\nafterwards brought the construction of the railway which unites the Lower\r\nto the Upper Congo to a successful termination, and who is now probably\r\nthe largest land-owner in Africa. These companies were doing a large\r\ntrade in rubber and ivory with the natives. They were well organised,\r\nand the man at their head was both capable and fearless. The companies\r\ninvoked the Act of Berlin, protested against its gross infringement by\r\nthe State, dwelt largely upon the sacredness of free trade and native\r\nrights, pleaded for Belgium and the world at large; and, finding these\r\nconsiderations insufficient, violently attacked the king himself with\r\nthe avowed intention of forcing him to abdicate his “sovereignty” on the\r\nCongo. It is useless to detail the process of an agitation which, if it\r\ndid nothing else, showed up in lurid colours how much the patriotism of\r\nthe King of the Belgians was subordinated to the egotism of the Sovereign\r\nof the Congo State. The upshot of it was that the king squared the\r\ncolonel, and the commercial companies of the Rue Bréderode group, as they\r\nare familiarly designated, were induced to keep silence by the grant of a\r\ntrading monopoly over a very large area where they would be free to carry\r\non their business unmolested. His resolute adversary being thus disposed\r\nof, the king forthwith issued a decree, dated October 1892, by which he\r\ndefined the limits of his _terres domaniales_, and crowned the policy\r\nhe had ever steadily pursued by creating for himself in Central Africa\r\na vast preserve, a _Domaine Privé_, from which he might draw unlimited\r\nresources with a view to his own personal enrichment. The extent of this\r\npreserve cannot cover less than 800,000 square miles.[261] The summit of\r\nKing Leopold’s ambition had been attained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTHE _DOMAINE PRIVÉ_\r\n\r\n    “Our only programme, I am anxious to repeat, is the work of\r\n    moral and material regeneration.”—Extract from a published\r\n    letter of his Majesty King LEOPOLD II., King of the Belgians,\r\n    Sovereign of the Congo Free State.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that writers who, from time to time, call attention\r\nto the terrible maladministration prevailing in the Congo State do not,\r\nas a rule, strive to bring its _causa causans_ clearly before the public.\r\nThe main issue becomes too often imbedded in a mass of surplus detail,\r\nand the bewildered individual searching for light gropes about in despair\r\nwith an eternal query on his lips—“Why?” Why these atrocities which have\r\nbeen attested by dozens of honourable men[262]—atrocities which the Congo\r\nState Administration has long ceased to deny, and now merely attempts to\r\nminimise; atrocities of which every mail from the Congo brings additional\r\nproof?[263] Why this callous ferocity which appears at first sight to\r\nhave in it naught but incoherence and downright stupidity, which seems\r\nso monstrous as to be almost incredible, and yet is vouched for, not\r\nonly by travellers and missionaries who have witnessed its effects, not\r\nonly by those who are in a position to guarantee the authenticity of\r\ninformation received from persons unwilling to allow their names to\r\nappear through fear of jeopardising their means of livelihood, but by\r\nthe actual perpetrators, who, not without reason—although this excuse\r\ncannot shield them from execration—throw the responsibility upon the\r\nsystem whose servants they have been? Where is the underlying motive of\r\nit all? The answer to the query is, the _Domaine Privé_. When you have\r\nlearnt what the _Domaine Privé_ is, what it means, what it involves,\r\nwhat it necessitates, what it renders inevitable, the story is told and\r\neverything is explained.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, let these main facts be borne well in mind. The vast\r\nterritories of the _Domaine Privé_ have for eleven years been absolutely\r\nclosed to legitimate private enterprise. Trade, which in Central Africa\r\nmeans the exchange of European merchandise for raw products, does not\r\nexist therein. The native living within these territories has been\r\ndeprived by Royal Decree of his rights as a land-owner. Property held\r\nfor centuries by well-defined native laws, vested in particular families\r\nand tribes, has been appropriated without consulting the interested\r\nparties, let alone compensating them. With the deprivation of his land\r\nthe native has been dispossessed of the fruits thereof; the rubber\r\ngrowing so luxuriously in his forests he may (by decree) only gather\r\nfor the State—we will see presently how the “may” becomes “must”; the\r\nivory stacked about his villages is no longer his, but another’s; the\r\nelephants which roam about his country and damage his plantations he can\r\nincur the physical peril of destroying, but may not reap the reward to\r\nwhich he is thereby entitled, for the tusks of the slain beast do not,\r\naccording to Royal Decree, belong to him. Since he cannot dispose of his\r\nproduce, which is his wealth and also his currency; since he has lost his\r\nrights in his own land; since he cannot even hunt the wild beast which\r\nprovides him with the wherewithal to make horns for war and the chase,\r\narmlets and anklets for his wives, ornaments for his habitation, he is\r\nno longer a free agent, but has become _de facto_ a serf. In theory,\r\nthen, the decrees of September 1891 and October 1892 made of the native\r\nthroughout the _Domaine Privé_ a serf. In theory a serf he remained\r\nfor a little while. But as the grip of Africa’s regenerator tightened\r\nupon the _Domaine Privé_, as the drilled and officered army, armed with\r\nrepeating-rifles, gradually grew and grew until it was larger than the\r\nnative forces kept up by any of the great Powers of Europe on African\r\nsoil,[264] as the radius of the rubber taxes was extended, as portions\r\nof the country began to be farmed out to so-called “companies,” whose\r\nagents were also officials of the king; the native of the _Domaine Privé_\r\nbecame a serf not in theory only but in fact, ground down, exploited,\r\nforced to collect rubber at the bayonet’s point, compelled to pay onerous\r\ntribute to men whose salaries depend upon the produce returns from their\r\nrespective stations—the punishment for disobedience, slothfulness,\r\nor inability to comply with demands ever growing in extortion, being\r\nanything from mutilation to death, accompanied by the destruction of\r\nvillages and crops.\r\n\r\nThe _Domaine Privé_ is “worked” in two ways. The country is vaguely\r\ndivided into districts, and the business of the _Commissaires_ of\r\ndistricts, and their agents and sub-agents, is to collect _impôts de\r\nnature_, the taxes in kind, which the king levies. There is no limit to\r\nthis taxation. The _Commissaires_ are told to “devote all their energies\r\nto the harvesting of rubber,” but at the same time to proceed “_as\r\nfar as possible_ by persuasion rather than force.” The purport of the\r\ninstructions maybe briefly summed up thus: “Obtain all the rubber and\r\nivory you can; your future advancement depends upon your energy.”[265]\r\nOf course, this _régime_ in a country like Africa, where the native is\r\nnot obliged to “work” in order to live, would be so much beating of the\r\nair, if force were not used to give it practical effect. King Leopold\r\nunderstood that well enough, and, to use the expression of a French\r\nColonial writer of repute—M. Pierre Mille—“the basis of the king’s\r\neconomic policy has been the formation of an army sufficiently strong to\r\nforce the natives to pay the rubber and ivory tax.” A large army, chiefly\r\nrecruited from the Bangalas and Batetlas—both cannibal tribes—was raised,\r\nand when not engaged in rebelling against its officers, it has proved\r\nonly too well its value.\r\n\r\nSide by side with the enforcement of the _impôts de nature_, King Leopold\r\nbethought him of another scheme whereby to increase his revenue, and, at\r\nthe same time, to throw dust in the eyes of European public opinion, by\r\nprofessing to sanction private enterprise in the _Domaine Privé_. His\r\nMajesty took to farming out portions of his domain to certain financiers\r\nwith whom it suited him to keep on good terms. “Companies” were formed,\r\nin which the State retained a half interest. These companies are supposed\r\nto obtain the rubber and ivory they ship home in such large quantities\r\nby barter; but as more often than not the king’s officials and the\r\ncompanies’ agents are the same persons, and as the companies have the\r\nassistance of the _Force Publique_ (or permission to raise their own\r\nforces) to facilitate their commercial operations,[266] we may judge of\r\nthe amount of legitimate barter trade which is carried on. There are six\r\nof these companies[267] in existence. The first group of five consists\r\nof the _Société Anversoise du Commerce au Congo, the Abir, the Compagnie\r\ndu Lomami, the Comptoir Commercial Congolais, and the Société Générale\r\nAfricaine_. The State holds half the shares of the _Abir_ and half the\r\nshares of the _Société Anversoise_. It has no shares in the _Comptoir\r\nCongolais_, but receives 50 per cent. of the profits. Its arrangement\r\nwith the _Compagnie du Lomami_ is, I believe, on the same lines as\r\nthat with the _Comptoir Commercial Congolais_; and with the _Société\r\nGénérale Africaine_ on the same lines as the _Abir_ and _Anversoise_.\r\nThe _Société_, or rather _Comité Spécial du Katanga_, is also a _Domaine\r\nPrivé_ company, but under a somewhat different form. One-third of the\r\nprofits of the latter institution go to the Thys group of companies and\r\ntwo-thirds to the State. The principal officials of the _Comité Spécial\r\ndu Katanga_—the sixth _Domaine Privé_ company—are Messrs. Droogmans\r\n(president and Secrétaire-Général), Arnold, De Keyser, and Lombard. All\r\nthese men are highly-placed officials of the State. Droogmans is the\r\nMinister of Finance, Arnold is director of the Domaine, director of\r\nAgriculture, and of “Central book-keeping”; De Keyser is a director of\r\nthe Finance Department, and Lombard is a director of the Department of\r\nthe Interior.\r\n\r\nThe _Société Anversoise du Commerce au Congo_ being a typical\r\nrepresentative, we may examine its condition. It was formed in August\r\n1892 under Belgian law, but reconstructed in January 1898 under Congo\r\nlaw—quite a unique jurisprudence, of which it may be said _summum jus\r\nsumma injuria_—with a capital of 1,700,000 francs divided into 3400\r\nshares of 500 francs each. King Leopold has conferred upon this company\r\nsome 12,000 square miles situated in the Mongalla district. Within\r\nthat large area, of course, no one has the right to enter; in that\r\nparticular, the Mongalla district resembles every other portion of the\r\nCongo _Free_ State above Leopoldville, in the sense of being a monopoly\r\nwithin a monopoly. The administrative seat of the _Anversoise_ is 104\r\nRempart des Béguines, Antwerp; its principal headquarters in Africa are\r\nat Mobeka. Its president is M. A. de Browne de Tiège, nominated under\r\nthe constitution of the company by the king himself. M. de Browne de\r\nTiège is the king’s principal financial adviser in Congo affairs, and\r\nhas several times lent moneys to the State. He has a seat in the House.\r\nThe administrators are Baron Goffinet,[268] Ed. Bunge, and C. de Browne\r\nde Tiège; the “Commissaire” is Count Emile le Grelle. The original\r\nshareholders are: the Congo State, 1700 shares; A. de Browne de Tiège,\r\n1100 shares; Bunge & Co., 100 shares; E. P. Grisar, 130 shares; Deyman\r\n& Druart, 100 shares—which accounts for 3130 out of the 3400. No one\r\nwith even a superficial knowledge of Belgian society need be told of the\r\nrelations between the king and Baron Goffinet, Count le Grelle and E. P.\r\nGrisar. The net profits for the four years 1897-1900 have been: 1897,\r\n120,697 francs; 1898, 3,968,832 francs; 1899, 3,083,976; 1900, 84,333, or\r\nsay a profit in four years of 7,275,838 francs. The “State’s” holdings\r\nbeing 50 per cent., its share in the profits would be proportionate. At\r\nthis point it may be well to remark that the inspired utterances which\r\nfrom time to time appear in the British Press, dated from Brussels, to\r\nthe effect that the Sovereign of the Congo State does not hold a single\r\nshare in these companies, constitute, of course, a polite fiction. In all\r\nmatters affecting the _Domaine Privé_ the State is the King. The _Domaine\r\nPrivé_, let it be reaffirmed once again, is the king’s property and his\r\nalone. The shares of the _Société Anversoise_ have stood as high as\r\n13,730 francs (March 1900), which for a 500-franc share is sufficiently\r\nalluring. At that figure, which can be easily verified by the sceptical,\r\nhis Majesty’s 1700 shares were worth over 23,000,000 francs, or say\r\n£933,000. During the last two years, outbreaks in the Mongalla district\r\nhave been so numerous that the profits of the company have fallen\r\nsomewhat.\r\n\r\nThe performances of this particular offshoot of King Leopold’s _Domaine\r\nPrivé_ have been worthy of the regenerating nature of the Congo State\r\nrule. In 1900, one or two of its agents confessed to killing, by order,\r\n150 natives, cutting off 60 hands, crucifying women and children, and\r\nimpaling the sexual remains of slaughtered males on the stockade of the\r\nvillages whose inhabitants were slow in gathering rubber! “_Les scandales\r\nde la Mongalla_” led to stormy debates in the Belgian Chamber on July 16\r\nand 17 of last year. It may not be out of place to recall their nature.\r\n\r\n    “July 17.—M. VANDERVELDE: We are not anti-colonial in\r\n    principle.... But we are adversaries of a capitalist colonial\r\n    policy which entails exploitation, theft, and assassination....\r\n    You dare not, in the name of Christian morality, defend the\r\n    exploitation of the _Domaine Privé_.... Rubber and ivory\r\n    represent 93 per cent. of the exports.... The _Domaine Privé_\r\n    produces much more than the budgetary returns. How are these\r\n    extraordinary results obtained?... The Congo State has\r\n    introduced forced labour, tribute, paid in kind, and a twelve\r\n    years’ military service.... We protest against this disguised\r\n    form of slavery. (Applause.) The greatest names in England\r\n    and Germany have condemned this system. The premiums given\r\n    to Congolese agents have been repudiated by the honest ones\r\n    amongst them. (M. DE BROWNE DE TIÈGE interrupts.) M. de Browne\r\n    de Tiège, who is interested in Congo affairs, must be admirably\r\n    posted in the Mongalla lawsuit, which revealed acts of cruelty\r\n    in his very own district.\r\n\r\n    “M. DE BROWNE DE TIÈGE: It is false.\r\n\r\n    “M. MAROILLE: No doubt; like the stories of the severed hands.\r\n\r\n    “M. LORAND: It is so true that, as a result of what I have\r\n    stated here, the particular officer whom I challenged to deny\r\n    the facts has written giving me information, in which he admits\r\n    that these ‘war trophies’ were brought in. That is Congo\r\n    civilisation! On all sides war, massacres, crimes continue\r\n    there. How can you possibly defend these things?\r\n\r\n    “M. FURNEMONT: On the coat-of-arms of the city of Antwerp\r\n    figure cut hands. M. de Browne, who inhabits Antwerp, no doubt\r\n    considers the emblem very appropriate....\r\n\r\n    “M. DE SMET DE NAEYER (Belgian Premier): The exploitation of\r\n    the _Domaine Privé_ is conformable with jurisprudence....\r\n    People criticise tribute paid in kind (_prestations de\r\n    nature_). Do they not exist to a certain extent in Belgium? Why\r\n    suspect the Congo State of cruelty?\r\n\r\n    “M. LORAND: We are entitled to do so. Remember the 1300 severed\r\n    hands.\r\n\r\n    “M. DE SMET DE NAEYER: Faults have certainly been committed,\r\n    but the State is applying itself to their disappearance. The\r\n    disinterestedness of the creators of the Congo State will find\r\n    its reward in the gratitude of the country....\r\n\r\n    “July 18.—M. LORAND: Your colonial policy is analogous to\r\n    the crimes mentioned in Article 125 of the Penal Code; it is\r\n    a policy of devastation, pillage, and assassination. [The\r\n    speaker (I quote from the Parliamentary report of the Belgian\r\n    papers of that date) then read some correspondence published\r\n    in the Antwerp newspaper _La Métropole_, in which a series of\r\n    executions, murders, and expeditions against the Bundjas are\r\n    mentioned.] ‘Are we,’ he continues, ‘to have another edition of\r\n    the severed hands incident?’\r\n\r\n    “M. DE BROWNE DE TIÈGE: That is not the question.\r\n\r\n    “M. LORAND: Indeed. But it happens precisely to be the\r\n    question. (M. DE BROWNE DE TIÈGE interrupts.)\r\n\r\n    “M. VANDERVELDE: Your interest, M. de Browne, is so direct\r\n    a one in this matter that you might refrain from any\r\n    participation in this debate.”\r\n\r\nThe cutting-off of hands item is a constantly recurring charge. I have\r\nin my possession at the present moment a photograph from the Upper Congo\r\nof three natives, a woman and two boys; the woman and one of the boys\r\nhave their right hands severed at the wrist, the other boy has both\r\nhands severed. The correspondent who sent it me—and whom I know to be an\r\nhonourable man—saw the victims himself, and was satisfied that soldiers\r\nof the State were the culprits. I fully believe him, but the photograph,\r\nof course, does not prove it.[269]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VICTIM OF A RUBBER RAID\r\n\r\nA LIVING ILLUSTRATION OF THE “MAIN COUPÉES” DEBATES IN THE BELGIAN\r\nCHAMBER. THE BOY HERE PHOTOGRAPHED IS NOW CARED FOR BY A BRITISH\r\nMISSIONARY IN THE UPPER CONGO]\r\n\r\nIn November last, an American ex-agent of the _Société Anversoise_, Mr.\r\nCanisuis, who served for some time under the amiable ex-Major Lothaire,\r\nwho, as already stated, was appointed Director in Africa of this company\r\n_after_ the murder of Stokes, in a Press interview said: “Last year I\r\nwas on a rubber expedition with Major Lothaire, and during the six weeks\r\nit lasted 900 natives were killed and scores of villages were burnt.”\r\n\r\nAccording to this gentleman, the natives receive the equivalent of one\r\npenny per pound of rubber, paid in merchandise valued at 100 per cent.\r\nabove cost price. We knew that before. As things go in the Congo State,\r\nthat particular rate of pay is even generous. But you cannot get rubber\r\nin Africa at even the munificent sum of one penny per pound, and sell\r\nit in Europe from 3s. to 4s. per pound, without those gently persuasive\r\nmethods which find favour in quarters where the “regenerating” instinct\r\nis properly developed!\r\n\r\nI trust I shall not be unduly troubling my readers if I pass another\r\nof King Leopold’s _Domaine Privé_ companies under review. It is not my\r\nfault that the whitewash has been laid on so thickly, and the process\r\nof scraping is bound to take some little time—and, from the author’s\r\npoint of view, no little trouble. What company could be better singled\r\nout than the _Abir_, the most powerfully equipped of all—the “Queen” of\r\nCongo companies as it has been called? Originally the Anglo-Belgian India\r\nRubber Company, founded in August 1892, and in which Colonel North was at\r\none time largely interested, it was, like the _Anversoise_, reconstructed\r\nunder “Congo law” in 1898 with a capital of 1,000,000 francs, divided\r\ninto 2000 shares without designation of value, “giving right of 1/2000\r\nof the _avoir social_.” King Leopold has conferred upon this company\r\nthe monopoly of exploitation in the Lopori and Maringa districts of the\r\n_Domaine Privé_. The administrative seat of the _Abir_ is 48 Rempart\r\nKlipdorp, Antwerp; its headquarters in Africa are at Bassankusu. The\r\nPresident is M. A. van den Nest; administrators, A. Mols and Count H.\r\nvan de Burgh; _Commissaires_, Jules Stappers and F. Reiss; Director, Ch.\r\nde Wael; Director in Africa, Ch. Sterckmans. I am under the impression\r\nthat the British interests in the company ceased when it ceased to be\r\na company in the ordinary acceptation of the term, viz. in 1898, as\r\naforesaid. At any rate, I can find none but Belgian shareholders in the\r\ndocuments I have been able to obtain. First and foremost comes the Congo\r\nState with its 50 per cent., viz. 1000 shares, the inevitable M. A. de\r\nBrowne de Tiège being _mandataire_ for the State; then M. A. de Browne\r\nde Tiège has 60 shares in his own name, and M. C. de Browne de Tiège 50,\r\nwhile our old friend the _Société Anversoise_ has 150 shares represented\r\nby M. de Browne de Tiège, President, and M. Bunge, Administrator; Bunge\r\n& Co. (whom we have seen hold 100 shares in the _Anversoise_) have 50\r\nshares; other shareholders are Alexis Mols, Charles de Wael, F. Reiss,\r\n&c.[270] I have used the word _clique_ to describe the handful of persons\r\nwho are running the Congo State (and as much more of Africa as they can\r\nlay hands on) with the king as Managing Director. It is an appropriate\r\nterm, as the particulars given for these two “Companies” show. I may add\r\nthat M. A. van den Nest, President of the _Abir_, is the original holder\r\nof 120 shares in the _Comptoir Commercial Congolais_, of which company M.\r\nAlexis Mols is President, while Messrs. Charles de Wael and F. Reiss are\r\nalso holders, the one to the extent of 100, the other to the extent of 60\r\nshares.[271] Baron Goffinet’s name crops up again in the _Lomami_,[272]\r\nand so it goes on.[273] These men are the king’s bodyguard. I know\r\nnothing of them personally. They may in private life be the most\r\nblameless of men, but the extraordinary thing is that Europe should be\r\ncontent to allow 1,000,000 square miles of African territory to be run\r\nby this _clique_ with its royal head, entirely for their own ends, and\r\nto fill their own pockets! Why, in the name of common sense and common\r\ndecency, should hundreds, if not thousands, of natives of Africa be slain\r\nannually on account of this _clique_? It would be grotesque, were it not\r\nso horrible; so monstrous as to seem more like a nightmare than a reality.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the _Abir_. Its net profits in 1897 were 1,247,455\r\nfrancs; in 1898, 2,482,697 francs; in 1899, 2,692,063 francs. The figures\r\nfor 1900 I am unable to give, I regret to say. In 1901 the net working\r\nprofits (_bénéfices nets d’exploitation_) were 2,455,182 francs, and\r\nthe “profit and loss account” was closed with 2,614,370 to the good.\r\nA dividend[274] of 900 francs was declared on each share, and “the\r\nState” being the possessor of 1000 shares, it follows that its august\r\nSovereign raked in the nice little sum of 900,000 francs, or say £36,000,\r\nfor one year’s working of this eminently satisfactory “subsidiary” of\r\nthe _Domaine Privé_. In four years the _Abir’s_ net profits amounted,\r\ntherefore, to 8,877,397 francs, nearly nine times as much as its total\r\ncapital! In June 1899 the shares stood at 17,900 francs per share, and\r\nthe total value on the Antwerp Stock Exchange of this concern, whose\r\ncapital is one million, was 35,800,000 francs! But since that date the\r\nshares have been up to over 25,000 francs per share! In June of this\r\nyear they had fallen to a little over 11,000 francs per share. For a\r\nconsiderable time past they have been quoted _in tenths_; that is to\r\nsay, one-tenth shares are bought and sold, and give rise to a great\r\ndeal of speculation on the Bourse. Imagine the fortune which a holder\r\nof 1000 _full_ shares has had the opportunity of making during the last\r\nfew years! Those 1000 shares, at 25,000 francs per share, were worth a\r\nmillion sterling! What it is to be a royal rubber merchant in the Congo!\r\n\r\nIt will have been noticed that the shares of the _Abir_ have dropped.\r\nThe fact is that there have been “indiscretions,” and several Belgian\r\nnewspapers published in October of last year some unpleasant details with\r\nregard to the circumstances under which these enormous stocks of rubber\r\nfind their way to Europe. Amongst other revelations published—all of\r\nwhich purported to come from “a most honourable and esteemed agent” of\r\nthe _Abir_—were the following: (1) In September 1897, the whole of the\r\nUpper Bolombo country was devastated (“_mis à feu et à sang_”) by the\r\nDikila factory to compel the natives, with whom contact had not before\r\nbeen established, to make rubber. (2) “On Aug. 24, 1900, I met at Boyela\r\ntwo young women, one of whom was _enceinte_, with their right hands cut\r\noff. They told me they belonged to the village of Bossombo, and that the\r\nsoldiers of the white man of Boyela had cut off their hands, because\r\ntheir master did not produce enough rubber!” These statements appear to\r\nhave had the effect of depreciating the market value of the shares. But,\r\nreally, the “bulls” might have been prepared for them. Possibly, they had\r\nnot read the evidence given a year before by M. de Lamothe, ex-Governor\r\nof French Congo, before the Commission of Colonial Concessions held in\r\nParis. M. de Lamothe, who had just returned from five months’ sojourn in\r\nthe Upper Congo, remarked in the course of his deposition that:\r\n\r\n    “The Belgians have recently had insurrections in their\r\n    territory. It is but right to add, however, that they sometimes\r\n    make use of proceedings towards the natives that Frenchmen\r\n    would never use.... The _Abir_, for instance, possesses a\r\n    considerable territory and has even police rights (_sic_)\r\n    over the natives. From that point of view the rights which\r\n    its charter confers upon it are exaggerated. _Its agents have\r\n    applied this so well that they have succeeded in inducing\r\n    30,000 natives to leave their territory and take refuge on the\r\n    French bank of the Congo._”\r\n\r\nIs it necessary to plunge yet deeper into this garbage of human\r\nvillany and greed? The entire system is based upon terrorism. No man\r\nin his senses can really believe otherwise. A volume might be filled\r\nwith misdeeds which since the days of Cortès and Pizarro have never\r\nbeen equalled, much less surpassed. The habitual _modus operandi_ in\r\nthe Mongalla territory was tersely put by one of the agents of the\r\n_Anversoise_:\r\n\r\n    “When natives bring rubber to a factory they are received by\r\n    the agent surrounded by soldiers. The baskets are weighed.\r\n    If they do not contain the 5 kilos. required the native\r\n    receives 100 blows with a _chicotte_.[275] Those whose\r\n    baskets attain the correct weight receive a piece of cloth,\r\n    or some other object. If a certain village contains, say, 100\r\n    male inhabitants (a census is always taken of the village\r\n    before operations begin) and only fifty come to the factory\r\n    with rubber, they are retained as hostages, and a force is\r\n    despatched to shoot (_sic_) the fifty recalcitrant natives and\r\n    burn their village.”\r\n\r\nThere are some districts which do not produce rubber: such a district,\r\nfor instance, as the Bangala country proper, where hardly any rubber\r\ngrows. Let it not be imagined that the people of that district are the\r\ngainers thereby. They are not subject, it is true, to either the rubber\r\ntribute or the rubber-collecting operations of the _Domaine Privé_\r\ncompanies. But their lot is little better for all that. The Bangala\r\ncountry is one of the great recruiting centres of the State for its\r\narmy.[276] The Bangalas are cannibals, and good fighters. It is also\r\na victualling centre for the State posts. A great deal of information\r\nhas been reaching me from this district of late. It may be usefully\r\nepitomised. First, as to the recruiting. The method adopted is this: A\r\ngeneral order is sent from Boma to the Commissaires of Districts to the\r\neffect that so many recruits must be sent down. Each Commissaire then\r\nsets to work to obtain recruits. There is no system in the demands. Towns\r\nare dropped on according to the whim of the Commissaire. A particular\r\nvillage is summoned to supply a certain number of young men. The summons\r\nis rarely communicated by a white officer: almost invariably by native\r\nsoldiers. The summons once made, it has to be obeyed, or the usual\r\npunishment is meted out. Nevertheless there has, upon occasion, been\r\nactive opposition to this forced recruiting. There is always passive\r\nopposition. Both men and women object and complain very bitterly, but\r\nthey have to submit. Mothers, wives, and relatives have been seen crying\r\nand protesting against their children, husbands, and relatives being sent\r\naway as recruits, for very few ever return; which is not astonishing,\r\nseeing that they serve twelve years. Secondly, as to the victualling-tax.\r\nEvery month, and sometimes every fortnight, goats, fowls, palm-oil, eggs,\r\nand cassava bread have to be supplied to the State troops. The burden is\r\nincreasingly heavy, because since it was first assessed the population\r\nhas very much decreased. When accused of extortion the State replies\r\nthat it pays for its produce. It does pay, at about one-twentieth of\r\nthe market value. The natives have not infrequently to purchase produce\r\nthemselves, in order to meet the demands of the State, which they are\r\ncompelled to dispose of to the State soldiers at a much lower price than\r\nthey have paid themselves:\r\n\r\n    “Every two or three miles a sentry, with a subordinate or two,\r\n    and two or three servants from the locality, are stationed. It\r\n    is part of the sentry’s duty to see that the tax is taken up\r\n    regularly, and if he does not do so he is severely reprimanded\r\n    by his chief. Now a keen-witted soldier will see to it that\r\n    he is not reprimanded, and an unprincipled soldier will do\r\n    anything to the people to wring the tax out of them, rather\r\n    than run the risk of being a marked man in the Commissaire’s\r\n    book.”\r\n\r\nThe oppression and misery which ensue can be imagined. The result of this\r\ndouble pressure for men and foodstuffs has been, naturally, to bring\r\nabout a great decrease in the population. A correspondent who knows the\r\nBangala country well, tells me that between 1890 and 1895 there was no\r\nperceptible decrease in the population. The taxes were first levied in\r\nthe latter year, and in five years (1895-1900) there has been a reduction\r\nof one-half of the population. This appalling ratio of reduction is\r\npartly to be accounted for by the fact that sleeping sickness is endemic\r\nin the country, and that the withdrawal of the strongest and most virile\r\nelements of the population to serve in the army is naturally followed\r\nby a decline in the birth-rate. Those that are left have “the heart\r\nwrung out of them” by the food-tax. The people along the river are\r\nfast dying out, and the State “is forcing the backwood folks to start\r\ntowns on the river the better to exploit them.” In one relatively small\r\narea my correspondent says, “Since 1890, one town half a mile long has\r\ndisappeared; another, a quarter of a mile long, has also gone; and up a\r\ncreek where there were 1500 people, there are scarcely 400 now.”\r\n\r\nSo long as Europe tolerates the _Domaine Privé_, so long will these\r\nthings be—just as long as the regenerator of Africa and his friends can\r\nmake money out of their philanthropic undertaking and can count upon\r\ndishonest, interested, or infatuated friends in Europe to throw dust in\r\nthe eyes of the public.\r\n\r\nThere is one other feature of this unsavoury business which must be gone\r\ninto before we can close the chapter on the _native_ aspect of Congo\r\nState rule. The Congo State invariably attempts to wriggle out of the\r\nresponsibility for these horrors, by attributing their perpetration\r\nto the “excesses” of individual agents; and M. Jules Houdret, the\r\nConsul-General of the Congo State for England, had the effrontery the\r\nother day to point to the punishment of some of the _Anversoise’s_\r\npeople as affording a justification for the State’s claim to be what\r\nit professes, viz. solicitous of the welfare of the natives! It is\r\na barefaced attempt to bamboozle public opinion, as impudent as the\r\nproposal made by the representatives of the Congo State at the Mansion\r\nHouse meeting last May to “inquire” into specific acts of cruelty\r\nbrought forward. We know what these “punishments” mean. Occasionally,\r\nwith a grand flourish of trumpets, the State announces that an agent\r\nhas been punished. The announcement generally follows each fresh crop\r\nof revelations. One or two sub-agents are, for the time being, made\r\nscapegoats, and everything goes on as before. How could it be otherwise\r\nwhen the SYSTEM ITSELF is what it has been shown to be? The time has\r\ngone by when the public can be deceived by these sophistries, by these\r\nperpetual and frivolous excuses and denials.\r\n\r\nThe edicts of the Congo State administration, coupled with certain\r\nmaterial facts as to which there can be no dispute, show the main\r\nfactors, if one may say so, of the system of African tropical\r\ndevelopment, which it has instituted, to be these:\r\n\r\n(1) Alienation of native ownership in land.\r\n\r\n(2) Monopoly over the products of the soil.\r\n\r\n(3) Natives forbidden to collect those products for any one but the\r\nState, or the subsidiary trusts (_Domaine Privé_ companies, if that\r\nappellation be preferred) created by the State, and in whose profits the\r\nState shares, generally to the extent of 50 per cent.\r\n\r\n(4) Natives compelled to bring in rubber and ivory, and also recruits for\r\nthe native army (and for labour in the cocoa and coffee plantations), to\r\nthe State as tribute, and to supply the subsidiary trusts with rubber and\r\nivory.\r\n\r\n(5) The existence of a regular army of fifteen thousand[277] men armed\r\nwith Albini rifles, and an unnamed number of irregulars to enforce the\r\nrubber and ivory tribute and to “facilitate the operations” of the\r\nsubsidiary trusts.\r\n\r\n(6) White officials in receipt of instructions to devote all their\r\nenergies to the exploitation of rubber and ivory; in plain words, to\r\nget as much rubber and ivory out of their respective districts as they\r\npossibly can.\r\n\r\n(7) The financial existence of the State dependent upon the rubber and\r\nivory tribute, and upon the profits it derives from its share in the\r\nsubsidiary trusts.\r\n\r\nWhen on the one side you have the factors already enumerated, and on\r\nthe other a primitive and—in the face of coercion backed by rifles\r\nof precision—helpless population, common sense asserts that gross\r\noppression, violence, and every form of tyranny and outrage must be the\r\ninfallible outcome of such a system; and it is that _system_ which the\r\nPowers are morally bound to put a stop to, seeing that it is they who are\r\nmorally responsible for its existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nTHE “TRADE” OF THE CONGO STATE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a little surprising to find that M. Cattier, the Belgian\r\nImperialist, whose masterly indictment of King Leopold’s administration\r\ndoes him infinite honour, should attempt to defend, not the outcome of\r\nthe system of the _Domaine Privé_ in the shape of compulsory military\r\nservice for twelve years, forced labour in Government plantations, &c.,\r\nall of which he condemns, but the legality of the system itself. He\r\nstates his case as follows. Article V. of the Berlin Act, which forbade\r\nmonopoly and privilege in the Congo Basin in matters of trade, was meant\r\nto apply internationally, and the Congo State was thereby bound not to\r\ngrant commercial advantages to the subjects of any one nation which it\r\ndenied to the subjects of another nation. M. Cattier says:\r\n\r\n    “The Government of the Congo State could not, therefore, adopt\r\n    any legislative measure, nor establish any _régime_ conceding\r\n    international monopolies or privileges.... All facilities\r\n    granted to its subjects in trade matters should be legally\r\n    extended to the subjects of other nations.... But this does\r\n    not prevent the Congo State from establishing the commercial\r\n    _régime_ which it thinks advisable, and no objection can be\r\n    raised against its legislative action, when the measures\r\n    adopted apply, under the same conditions and in the same\r\n    manner, to the subjects of other nationalities, including the\r\n    Congo nationality.”\r\n\r\nIt follows, therefore, according to M. Cattier, that in attributing to\r\nhimself all vacant lands in the Congo Basin, from which action arose the\r\n_Domaine Privé_, and in farming out portions of the _Domaine Privé_ to\r\nhis financial friends, upon whom he has conferred an absolute monopoly of\r\nexploitation in the regions affected, the Sovereign of the Congo State\r\nhas not violated the Act of Berlin; although M. Cattier admits that by\r\nso doing he has committed “a violation of the rights of the natives.”\r\n\r\nThis curious theory of M. Cattier’s has been dismissed by Dr. Anton\r\n(_Professeur agrégé à l’Université d’Iéna_) as a legal quibble, in which\r\nopinion I entirely concur. M. Cattier’s views are mutually destructive.\r\nAdmitting, for the sake of argument merely, that the interpretation he\r\ngives to Art. V. of the Berlin Act is, from the strictly legal aspect\r\nof the matter, accurate; once M. Cattier attempts to put his case in\r\nlanguage that laymen, unversed in legal subtleties, can understand, it\r\nbreaks down hopelessly. For what does M. Cattier tell us in the passage\r\nabove? “No objection can be raised against its (the State’s) legislative\r\naction when the measures adopted apply under the same conditions and\r\nin the same manner to the subjects of all nationalities, including the\r\nCongo nationality.” But the measures adopted do not apply equally to\r\nall nationalities! Three-fourths of the Congo State is the State’s—that\r\nis, the king’s—private property, and is closed to the trade of all\r\nnationalities, except the Belgian and “Congo nationality;” not in theory\r\nbut in fact. Can an Englishman, or a German, or a Chinaman if you like,\r\nimport European merchandise in the territory, for example, acquired by\r\nthe _Société Anversoise_, and barter that merchandise against the raw\r\nproducts of the soil, on a basis of a legitimate commercial transaction?\r\nOf course they may not. Was not an Austrian arrested—on Lake Moëro, and\r\non, it appears, a British steamer—only a few months ago for trading with\r\nthe natives in the Katanga region, although he actually had a permit to\r\ntrade from the Katanga Company, given to him prior to the arrangement\r\narrived at by the Congo State and the Katanga Company to work those\r\nterritories on joint account? And arrested, too, in such a way that\r\nhis removal from this world was a matter of moral certainty—handed\r\nover to the merciful treatment of King Leopold’s cannibal soldiery,\r\nto be transported 2000 miles away; he a white man and unarmed![278]\r\nWhat pitiful sophistries are these which attempt the squaring of the\r\nCongo circle! The Congo State, which undertook not to trade directly or\r\nindirectly in its dominions, has become not only the largest “exploiter”\r\nwithin it, but in the major portion thereof the exclusive “exploiter.”\r\nThe king has translated Article V. of the Berlin Act, which reads that\r\n“no Power which exercises or shall exercise sovereign rights in the\r\nabove-mentioned regions, shall be allowed to grant therein a monopoly or\r\nfavour of any kind in matters of trade,” by conferring upon himself an\r\nabsolute monopoly, which has made of him the biggest ivory and rubber\r\nmerchant in the world. In this capacity he can export his produce under\r\nspecial conditions, free of dues, which come out of one of his Majesty’s\r\npockets to go in at the other. All this is diametrically opposed to the\r\nprovisions of the Berlin Act.\r\n\r\nMy object is principally to prove that King Leopold’s intervention in\r\nthe Dark Continent has from first to last been due to selfish motives,\r\nand has resulted in the most appalling consequences; whether we confine\r\nourselves to the past and present merely, or whether we look into the\r\nfuture. I must crave forgiveness for having dwelt so largely upon matters\r\nof trade. It was, however, necessary, because the king’s native policy is\r\nthe inevitable sequel of his commercial policy. I must, indeed, revert\r\nagain to this aspect of the question in order to refute once and for\r\nall the untruths so sedulously fostered, that the Congo State is in a\r\nnourishing condition and that independent trade is flourishing within\r\nit; and in refuting it to show—which is more important—that, were it not\r\nfor the ivory and rubber which the natives of King Leopold’s preserve\r\nare forced to produce at the cost of constant warfare, massacres, and\r\natrocities innumerable, the export returns, and consequently the whole\r\ntrade of the Congo State, would be practically _nil_, or so small as to\r\nbe unworthy of attention. This can best be done by giving facts and\r\nfigures which all the ingenious theorising in the world cannot overcome.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the relative proportion of the rubber and ivory\r\nexports from the Congo to the total exports:\r\n\r\n                                TABLE I\r\n\r\n                                         Total of       Total of\r\n    Year.

As will be\r\nobserved, the Congo State is at pains to conceal the real proceeds. Ever\r\nsince 1893, when the actual returns exceeded the estimates by one-half,\r\nthe State has never published the former. The correct figures may,\r\nhowever, approximately be arrived at by comparing the estimates with the\r\nrubber and ivory disposed of by the State, as vendor, on the Antwerp\r\nmarket. The enormous difference during these last few years between the\r\nestimates _and the produce actually sold by the State_, possesses a\r\nsignificance which will not be lost upon my readers. Into whose pocket\r\ndoes the surplus go? But need we ask the question?\r\n\r\n                                 TABLE II\r\n\r\n          VALUE OF PRODUCE (IVORY AND RUBBER) DERIVED FROM THE\r\n        “DOMAINE PRIVÉ” IN THE SHAPE OF TAXES (IMPÔTS DE NATURE).\r\n\r\n                                                    Produce (ivory and\r\n                                                     rubber) from the\r\n    Year.

The illustration is\r\nin itself sufficient to destroy the theory of commercial prosperity so\r\nassiduously propagated by King Leopold and his friends, in order to\r\ndeceive public opinion. Such “prosperity” entails the death of many human\r\nbeings. What could, indeed, be more eloquent of the true condition of\r\naffairs! The total exports from the Congo State in 1899 are found (see\r\nTable I.) to amount to 36,067,959 francs, of which 33,935,537 francs are\r\nrepresented by rubber and ivory, in which the Congo State’s share as\r\ntax-gatherer is no less than 19,130,000 francs. The Congo State asserts\r\nthat it does not trade. It merely imposes taxes which every “civilised”\r\nPower (Heaven save the mark!) has the right to do; yet it incorporates\r\nin its so-called trade figures the yield of its taxes! What becomes,\r\nthen, of this flourishing trade we hear so much about? On the evidence\r\nproduced, it sinks for 1889 to 16,937,959 francs (36,067,959 minus\r\n19,130,000) instead of 36,067,959 francs, which the world is invited\r\nto believe. In reality it does not amount to anything like 16,937,959\r\nfrancs, for the simple reason that there is no “trade” at all in the\r\nCongo State north of Leopoldville; and that, if we extract from the\r\nremaining figures the exports from the Lower Congo, where genuine trade,\r\nsadly hampered by taxation, alone exists, the balance is represented by\r\nthe shipments of the _Domaine Privé_ subsidiary monopolies in which the\r\nCongo State benefits to the extent of 50 per cent.; and by the shipments\r\nof the Thys Trust, which is a monopoly within a monopoly, although\r\nconducted, it is but right to add, on different lines. Such is the\r\n“trade” of the Congo State, the most gigantic fraud which ever came into\r\nbeing to work misery upon mankind.\r\n\r\nIt would be unjust not to recognise that all this sordid history\r\nhas aroused loathing and distress in the hearts of many honourable\r\nBelgians—not confined to the Party which opposes Colonial policy for\r\nBelgium—mainly, as I believe, on the ground that King Leopold, in the\r\ncourse of his illegalities and intrigues, will end by compromising\r\nthe neutrality of his country. It would be as equally unjust not to\r\nexpress admiration for the indomitable energy displayed by Colonel\r\nThys in constructing the railway to Leopoldville, as to include in the\r\ncondemnation of King Leopold’s POLICY in Africa all the Belgians who\r\nhave been employed at one time or another in the State service. Sir\r\nHarry Johnston has recently lent the weight of his name in favour of the\r\nCongo State, in respect to the “very small portion” of the State which\r\nhe has visited. Sir Harry Johnston might have added that the rubber laws\r\nare not in full operation in the “very small portion” of the country\r\nhe visited, and that the Belgian officers with whom he came in contact\r\nhave not been employed in that degrading business, their duties in that\r\nparticular region being confined to strengthening the obscure political\r\naims which King Leopold is pursuing in the Nile Valley. For a description\r\nof the state of affairs prevailing south of the “very small portion”\r\nof the Congo State alluded to, Mr. Grogan’s volume, and Mr. Robert\r\nCodrington’s recently published “Travel and Trade Routes in Northern\r\nRhodesia and adjacent Parts of East Central Africa,”[281] together with\r\nthe revelations attending the treatment meted out to the late Mr. Rabinek\r\nby the officials of the State, may be consulted with advantage. It would\r\nbe an insult to Sir Harry Johnston—who has himself condemned the system\r\nof territorial concessions—to suggest that he desires in any way to\r\nbolster up the Congo State; but it is certainly a thousand pities that\r\nhe has committed himself, even partially, to statements which, however\r\naccurate in themselves, cannot fail to exercise an unfortunate influence,\r\nwithout making himself acquainted with the general system under which\r\nthe Congo State is run. When the nature of that system is understood, it\r\nbecomes an outrage upon common sense and common decency to write one word\r\nin extenuation of the system, or of the man who has originated it.\r\n\r\nM. Cattier, to whose work I have several times alluded, represents the\r\ntype of Belgian who, convinced of the necessity of a colonial programme\r\nfor Belgium, has sufficient perspicacity to realise, and sufficient\r\ncourage to assert, that the policy of King Leopold in the Congo State\r\ncarries within it the germs of death. How true this is, the reader must\r\njudge for himself; but it is at least significant that among a section\r\nof French Colonial writers who think they see in the recent abandonment\r\nof M. Beernaert’s Annexation Bill, at the king’s dictation, the final\r\npostponement by Belgium and the consequent assertion—at some future\r\ndate—of France’s right of pre-emption, are beginning to ask themselves\r\nwhether the king’s ultimate aim is not to continue for some years longer\r\nhis “ruinous exploitation” of the Congo State; and then, when uprisings\r\nhave reached such a scale that the king’s cannibal army, however large it\r\nmay by that time have become, is powerless to cope with them; and when\r\nwhole tracts of the richest and most easily accessible rubber districts\r\nhave been irretrievably impaired, to offer the squeezed lemon, for a\r\nconsideration, to his Gallic neighbours. If the pernicious _régime_\r\nwhich King Leopold has inaugurated in Africa were confined to the Congo\r\nState, it would still be sufficient, one might have thought, to stir the\r\nconscience of Europe, if not for the sake of her own dignity outraged in\r\nthe violation of solemn obligations, if not for the sake of humanity,\r\nthen for the sake of the future relations of black man and white man in\r\nCentral Africa. But, as we have seen, the _régime_ is spreading, and with\r\nevery year that passes it threatens more acutely all legitimate European\r\nenterprise in Africa.[282]\r\n\r\nThis accursed _Domaine Privé_, and all the evils it has brought with it,\r\ncannot last for ever. Like all such “negations of God” it will perish.\r\nBut what will remain behind for Europe, when the Congo State has passed\r\naway, to deal with? A vast region, peopled by fierce Bantu races, with an\r\nundying hatred of the white implanted in their breasts; a great army of\r\ncannibal levies, drilled in the science of forest warfare, perfected in\r\nthe usage of modern weapons of destruction[283]—savages whose one lesson\r\nlearned from contact with European “civilisation” has been improvement\r\nin the art of killing their neighbours; disciplined in the science of\r\nslaughter; eager to seize upon the first opportunity which presents\r\nitself of turning their weapons against their temporary masters; rendered\r\nmore desperate, more dangerous, more debased than before the advent of\r\nKing Leopold’s rubber collectors, who, by way of regeneration, have\r\ngrafted upon the native’s failings, born of ignorance, the worst vices\r\nof the Africanised civilisation of modern Europe—cupidity, hypocrisy,\r\ncruelty, and lust.\r\n\r\nIn their own most obvious interests, for the sake of humanity and right,\r\nin the name of enlightened statesmanship and political common sense,\r\nthe Powers cannot allow the disease introduced into West and Central\r\nAfrica by King Leopold of Belgium to be farther extended. Nor do their\r\nresponsibilities end there. The source of the disease must be dealt with.\r\nThe canker must be rooted out and cast upon the dunghill. The Congo State\r\nmust be called to account for its crimes against civilisation; for its\r\noutrages upon humanity; for the unparalleled and irreparable mischief it\r\nhas committed.\r\n\r\nAnd what a warning lies here for the Western nations! The Congo State is\r\nthe living embodiment of the evil counsels, so lavishly, so thoughtlessly\r\ngiven in connection with native policy in West Africa. In the Congo\r\nState we see what these counsels lead to when put into practice. All\r\nthis talk about the puerility of preserving land tenure, the futility of\r\nmaintaining native institutions, the efficacy of punitive expeditions,\r\nthe necessity of teaching the native “the dignity of labour,” the cry for\r\nterritorial concessions, the advocacy of monopoly, and all legislative\r\nacts framed in accordance with these views, or with some of them, tend to\r\nproduce in greater or less degree a state of affairs in Western Africa\r\nsimilar to that which prevails on the Congo. In the case of the Powers,\r\nthe motives may be of the very best, the intentions honest and sincere;\r\nbut if once the thin end of the wedge be driven home; if once legislation\r\nbe passed or acts sanctioned which are founded upon a repudiation of\r\nthe inherent right of the native to his land and the fruits thereof; if\r\nonce it be officially admitted that it is legitimate to force the native\r\nto give under compulsion that which is purchasable on fair terms, we\r\nare committed to a policy of reaction of which no man can prophesy the\r\nconsequences or the end. To those conceptions Tropical Africa opposes her\r\nvastness, her climate, and the prolific nature of her peoples. They can\r\nbe tried; apparent success may attend them for a time; lasting success\r\nthey will never secure. Tropical Africa _cannot permanently be held\r\ndown by force_, and in attempting to do so by placing modern engines\r\nof destruction in the hands of Africans, Europe will be but digging the\r\ngrave of her ambitions on African soil.\r\n\r\nBut Europe can achieve a great work in Tropical Africa for good,\r\nand benefit her own peoples in doing so. To divorce the two is\r\nimpossible. Evil wrought in Tropical Africa will have its aftermath\r\nin Europe. The European has need of the Negro, and the Negro of the\r\nEuropean. In occupying the country of the Negro, Europe has assumed\r\na great responsibility. It is well, perhaps, European statesmen\r\nshould occasionally be reminded, that for Europe to forget the moral\r\nresponsibility in pursuing the material ends is to invite a certain\r\nNemesis. These pages cannot be more fittingly closed than by recalling\r\nthe words of a wise and good woman, who understood the nature and\r\nimmensity of the problem:\r\n\r\n“Not only do the negroes not die off in the face of white civilisation\r\nin Africa, but they have increased in America, whereto they were taken\r\nby the slave trade. This fact urges on us the belief that these negroes\r\nare a great world race—a race not passing off the stage of affairs, but\r\none that has an immense amount of history before it. The moulding of\r\nthat history is in the hands of the European, whose superior activity\r\nand superior power in arts and crafts give the mastery; but all that\r\nthis mastery gives is the power to make the future of the negro and\r\nthe European prosperous, or to make it one of disaster to both alike.\r\nWhatever we do in Africa to-day, a thousand years hence there will be\r\nAfricans to thrive or suffer for it.”[284]\r\n\r\n                                                                  E.

According\r\nto the statement made this year before the Legislative Council of the\r\nColony by Sir Matthew Nathan, the Imperial Government advanced £400,000\r\non account of the last Ashanti expedition, but whether this sum includes\r\nthe £202,300 advanced for the same purpose in 1900 is not clear. Assuming\r\nthat it does, the liabilities incurred by the Colony from 1897 to 1902\r\ninclusive will amount: (1) Loans by Imperial Government, £1,491,000; (2)\r\nGold Coast Government Loan, £1,035,000; Total, £2,328,300.\r\n\r\nThe Ashanti Blue Book (1901) estimated the total cost of administrating\r\nAshanti at about £60,000 per annum. According to Sir Matthew Nathan’s\r\nstatement referred to above, the expenditure in 1902 may be set down at\r\n£107,148. Assuming these figures to be correct, the total expenditure in\r\nAshanti from 1897 to 1902 (reckoning an expenditure of £60,000 in 1901)\r\nworks out at the very large figure of £319,385, entirely exclusive of\r\ngrants-in-aid (assuming the £202,300 in 1900 to be incorporated in the\r\n£400,000 advance), amounting to £695,000. Up to and including 1900, the\r\nrevenue of Ashanti was £3406. In the Ashanti Blue Book already mentioned,\r\nthe annual revenue for Ashanti is estimated at £14,600, less 10 per cent.\r\nto the Chiefs (_i.e._ less £1460). Assuming this amount to have been\r\ncollected in 1901 and 1902, the total revenue for Ashanti from 1897 to\r\n1902 inclusive amounted to £29,686, against an expenditure of £319,385,\r\nand grants-in-aid to the amount of £695,000.\r\n\r\nThese figures should be borne in mind when examining the following\r\ntables, which do not go farther than 1900, that is to say, as far as the\r\nlast issued Colonial Office Report.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPENDITURE, GRANTS-IN-AID, AND REVENUE OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES AND\r\nASHANTI\r\n\r\n1897-1900 inclusive\r\n\r\n\r\nTOTALS\r\n\r\n                            Expenditure.

The total\r\nexports, less specie, for the above-mentioned period were as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPORT, LESS SPECIE\r\n\r\n    1896      £906,393\r\n    1897       740,179\r\n    1898       821,112\r\n    1899       834,358\r\n    1900-1901  705,237\r\n\r\nThere are special reasons to account for the heavy fall in 1900-1901.\r\nNevertheless, a glance at the expenditure and export columns cannot fail\r\nto accentuate the fact that the growth in expenditure is incommensurate\r\nwith the increase in the purchasing power of the Colony. The financial\r\nfuture of Lagos now depends entirely on the railway. When the entire sum\r\nauthorised has been expended, which will be this year, I believe, and\r\nother expenses are added thereto, it is estimated that the railway will\r\nhave cost about £9000 to £10,000 per mile. In this connection the Dahomey\r\nfigures should be consulted.\r\n\r\nThe notes in the expenditure column include, of course, moneys expended\r\non public works. The growth in expenditure and the relation it bears to\r\nthe producing capacity of the country would, perhaps, appear even more\r\nclearly if the expenditure totals were given, minus the expenditure on\r\npublic works. It has not been possible to satisfactorily separate them in\r\nevery case; but, as a simple illustration, 1893 and 1900 may be compared.\r\n\r\n          Ordinary expenditure.   Export trade.\r\n    1893        £75,207             £836,295\r\n    1900        131,742              831,257\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that whereas, within the period given—eight\r\nyears—ordinary expenditure has nearly doubled, the producing power of\r\nthe country is found, at the close of the eighth year, to be stationary.\r\nIt may be argued, and justly, that the area of the Protectorate has been\r\nextended since 1893. But the point is, _the way these dependencies are\r\nmanaged_. Is not the management carried out upon altogether too elaborate\r\nand expensive a scale? Does this increase in ordinary expenditure\r\ncorrespond with an increase in the production, that is to say, in the\r\nprosperity of the colony and the people of the colony? If it does not,\r\nno special knowledge of political economy is required to predict that,\r\nif the system be not modified in the future, the steadily increasing\r\nexpenditure will, before very long, act as a positive deterrent upon the\r\nproducing power of the country. In fact, there is sufficient evidence\r\nto justify the fear that in some instances this stage has already been\r\nreached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE TABLES OF IMPORT DUTIES IN VOGUE IN LAGOS AND DAHOMEY\r\n\r\n\r\n                               DAHOMEY.

First section,\r\nKotonu-Acheribe (Atcheribe). Second section, Acheribe-Tcharu.\r\n\r\nLength of first section, 186 kilometres, or say 115 miles. Estimated cost\r\nof first section, 63,000 francs per kilometre. Estimated total cost of\r\nfirst section, 11,718,000 francs.\r\n\r\nIn English figures[308]—Total estimated cost of first section, 115 miles\r\nlong, £468,740, or say £4076 per mile.\r\n\r\nIt is intended to subsequently carry on this line from Tcharu to Karimama\r\non the Niger.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULTS AS FAR AS AT PRESENT KNOWN\r\n\r\nActual work commenced May 1, 1900. In March 1902, 82 kilometres, or\r\nsay 51 miles, of embankment, earthworks and “ouvrages d’art” complete,\r\nwere handed over to the Concessionnaire, who is called upon to provide\r\nand lay down sleepers and rails, provide rolling-stock, &c. Fifty more\r\nkilometres, or say 32 miles, similarly complete, were ready at the date\r\nmentioned to be handed over to the Concessionnaire. The Colony, which\r\nhas itself undertaken the work, has thus prepared in less than two years\r\n132 kilometres, or say 82 miles of line. The chief difficulties met with\r\nhave been in crossing the swamps between Kotonu and Godomey, the marshy\r\nstreams of Whydah and the Pahu lagoon, where the earthworks are 26 feet\r\nhigh. To fill up a depression of 16 feet in the centre of the lagoon\r\n40,000 cubic metres of sand and earth were required. A distance of 12\r\nkilometres between Wagbo (Ouagbo) and Taffo required 75,000 cubic metres\r\nof embankment. In the crossing of the Lama 2500 workmen were continuously\r\nemployed for five months in placing 80,000 cubic metres of gravel. All\r\nthe labour was found in the Colony. The number of natives continuously\r\nemployed has varied from 3500 to 5000, _entirely recruited through the\r\nChiefs_. There has been no trouble with the workmen, and no police force\r\nhas been employed on the works. The export trade of the Colony has not\r\nsuffered during the process, notwithstanding the withdrawal of so large\r\na quantity of labour from the farms; but, indeed, has increased,[309] a\r\ntribute to the wisdom of leaving the _recruiting entirely in the hands of\r\nthe Chiefs_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINANCE\r\n\r\nThe Colony undertakes the cutting embankment, earthworks, &c., everything\r\nbut the laying of the rails, sleepers, the providing of the same,\r\nrolling-stock, stations and so forth.\r\n\r\nIt has undertaken to advance for five years _out of its own local\r\nresources_ a sum of one million francs, say £40,000 annually. For 1901\r\nthe Colony undertook to provide £60,000, instead of £40,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL REMARKS\r\n\r\nThe French accurately claim that their railway will carry them much\r\nfarther inland for a given distance covered than the Lagos railway with\r\nthe big curve eastward which it takes from Abbeokuta; whereas they\r\nare pushing their line almost due north, and at their present rate of\r\nprogress, in comparison with the time taken over the British line, their\r\niron horse will have penetrated very much farther into the interior than\r\nIlorin, long before the British line creeps up to that place. Upon this\r\npremise they base a number of conclusions, the first and foremost of\r\nwhich is that the French line will thus be able to capture the inland\r\ntraffic which finds its way into the Lagos hinterland from the Niger,\r\nalong the Nikki road (the French have a “post” at Nikki, which is a great\r\ncentre for the caravan traffic), and to drain the western portion of\r\nSokoto, to the detriment naturally of Lagos and Northern Nigeria. Well,\r\nin Northern Nigeria we do not seem to care much about trade, the military\r\nand political policy being more showy, albeit a nice little bill will\r\nhave to be met presently, for the showy policy cannot be indulged in in\r\nWest Africa without having to pay the piper some day. But in the case of\r\nLagos it is a different affair, and the French argument is worth looking\r\ninto. There can be no doubt that if the Concessionnaire of the Dahomey\r\nline lays his rails and provides his rolling-stock at the same ratio of\r\nspeed as the Colony has performed its share of the work, the contention\r\nthat the French rail-head will in a couple of years be carried deeper\r\ninto the interior is correct. That the Concessionnaire will do so is,\r\nof course, an assumption. He has been engaged in quarrelling with his\r\ncontractors for a considerable time, but now it appears he is seriously\r\nsetting to work; at least, that is the information I get from Lagos. It\r\nis equally true that the French line, when it has reached its terminus\r\nat the 377th mile, will plunge into a network of trade roads, branching\r\neastwards to Lagos and westwards to Togo, and will have an excellent\r\nchance of diverting the flow of the internal commerce from both those\r\nColonies. To that extent Lagos will probably be a loser, because the\r\nAfrican is very conservative and will cling to his old trade routes\r\nrather than abandon them for new ones, and naturally the French railway\r\nwill benefit him. But the French, perhaps, forget that the Lagos line,\r\nas far as Ibadan, at any rate—as far, that is to say, as it goes at\r\npresent—does not rely upon inland traffic for its existence. It will\r\nbe fed locally by the increased production which will accrue along its\r\nline of march by the conversion of thousands of carriers of produce,\r\ninto cultivators and reapers of produce. Between Ibadan and Ilorin, it\r\ncannot hope to do much anyhow. Beyond Ilorin again, increased local\r\nproduction will feed it, Nupe being a rich and well-populated country. If\r\nthe British line remains stationary at Ibadan for many years, however,\r\nthe danger from its French competitor, supposing the latter to follow a\r\nprogressive construction, would certainly become more acute. Here, again,\r\nthe question of finance comes in, and the French Colony is decidedly\r\nbetter off. What greater contrast could, indeed, be imagined?—Lagos\r\nin debt to the tune of over a million, burdened for all time with an\r\nannual drain of £50,000, while Dahomey is not in debt to the extent of\r\none penny, and cheerfully advances £60,000 in one year to the works of\r\nconstruction out of its surplus funds! As for the _cost_ of construction,\r\nif the French estimates hold good, or anywhere near it, the French line\r\nwill be built at about half the cost of its British competitor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince the above remarks were written news has been received that 65\r\nkilometres of the railway were opened to traffic in September, and that\r\nrail-head is expected to reach Abomey in January next.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH GUINEA RAILWAY\r\n\r\nLENGTH.

One steel bridge thirty-three\r\nyards long is already fixed up, and two others are in process of being\r\nso. The 34 kilometres which remain are being proceeded with rapidly.\r\nSeventeen hundred workmen are continuously engaged thereon. Rails and\r\nsleepers are being regularly landed at Konakry. The first locomotive\r\nhas arrived. By October the rolling-stock complete for the first 150\r\nkilometres, say 92 miles, will have arrived in the Colony.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINANCE\r\n\r\nFor the first section the Colony borrowed from the “Caisse des\r\nRetraites,” on its own guarantee, eight million francs (£320,000), at 4\r\n10% in August 1899; and four million francs (£160,000) at 4% from the\r\n“Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations” in March 1901. The first loan is\r\nto be paid back in forty annual payments, and the second in twenty-five\r\nannual payments, the two annuities together amounting to 430,000 francs,\r\nor say £17,200.\r\n\r\nThese loans will be further supplemented by drafts upon the Colony’s\r\nlocal funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST AFRICAN MAHOGANY TRADE\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTS OF WEST AFRICAN MAHOGANY INTO EUROPEAN PORTS IN THE YEARS\r\n1898-1901\r\n\r\n    1898        40,167 tons\r\n    1899        48,902  ”\r\n    1900        55,959  ”\r\n    1901        44,582  ”\r\n\r\n\r\nDESTINATION OF IMPORTS IN 1901\r\n\r\n    Liverpool   29,312 tons\r\n    London       6,998  ”\r\n    Glasgow        278  ”\r\n    Germany      4,735  ”\r\n    France       3,259  ”\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTS, IN SUPERFICIAL FEET, OF WEST AFRICAN MAHOGANY INTO LIVERPOOL FOR\r\nTHE PAST 13 YEARS\r\n\r\n    Sup. ft.  1889      68,000\r\n       ”      1890     259,000\r\n       ”      1891   1,600,000\r\n       ”      1892   3,000,000\r\n       ”      1893   4,984,000\r\n       ”      1894   4,700,000\r\n       ”      1895   3,400,000\r\n       ”      1896   5,098,000\r\n       ”      1897   8,134,000\r\n       ”      1898  10,519,000\r\n       ”      1899  13,508,000\r\n       ”      1900  14,034,000\r\n       ”      1901  11,652,000\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORT, CONSUMPTION AND STOCK OF WEST AFRICAN MAHOGANY INTO LIVERPOOL\r\n1898-1901\r\n\r\n                 1898.          1899.          1900.          1901.\r\n\r\n  IMPORT      10,519,000 ft. 13,508,000 ft. 14,034,000 ft. 11,652,000 ft.\r\n  CONSUMPTION 10,571,000  ”  13,496,000  ”  13,764,000  ”  11,978,000  ”\r\n  STOCK          633,000  ”     645,000  ”     915,000  ”     589,000  ”\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTS OF WEST AFRICAN MAHOGANY INTO LIVERPOOL FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS\r\nOF 1901 AND 1902 RESPECTIVELY\r\n\r\n                                              LOGS\r\n\r\n                              January.

I am somewhat reluctant to write anything on the\r\npoint, because I know absolutely nothing about mining; and the opinions\r\nI have formed, such as they are, are the outcome (1) of conversations\r\nwith a number of men who are more or less experts, and have formed their\r\nviews of the prospects of the Gold Coast mining industry from personal\r\ninvestigation on the spot; (2) the perusal of a quantity of reports by\r\nCompanies which are operating and prospecting ... and by Companies which\r\nare doing nothing at all but squander their shareholders’ money; (3)\r\nhistorical research and study of the past performances of the Gold Coast\r\nas a gold producer. Beyond that I have no knowledge whatever; nothing but\r\nopinions, which perhaps the reader will kindly bear in mind when perusing\r\nthe following notes.\r\n\r\nThere is not the slightest doubt that gold exists in considerable\r\nquantities in West Africa. The earliest records we have of any trade at\r\nall being done on the West Coast of Africa is a trade in gold dust. The\r\nexternal trade of West Africa dates back to the period when the Negroes\r\nbeheld the Carthaginian galleys bearing down upon their shores. The\r\ninternal gold trade of West Africa is probably even more remote—but there\r\nwe enter the domain of conjecture.\r\n\r\nThere is not the slightest doubt that the Portuguese, Dutch, English,\r\nFrench, and so on, obtained enormous quantities of gold from the Gold\r\nCoast.\r\n\r\nFor many years the gold _trade_ in the Gold Coast has practically been a\r\nthing of the past. The gold _trade_, as a trade, is long since dead.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of last century the great gold store—which had been\r\naccumulating for ages—of the Coast peoples of the Gold Coast became\r\nexhausted. At that period the Ashantis, farther inland, still retained\r\nlarge quantities of gold ostentatiously displayed. James, Bowdich,\r\nDupuis, Hutton, and Hutcheson bear witness to that. With the gradual\r\nundermining of the Ashanti Kingdom this store also disappeared.\r\n\r\nComing to more recent times, we find that the geological formation known\r\nas “banket” was discovered in 1878 in the Takwa district by a French\r\ntraveller called Bonnat. That seems to have been the basis of the future\r\nmodern mining industry in the Gold Coast, replacing the extinct trade.\r\n\r\nMany years of disappointment and failure followed Bonnat’s discovery,\r\ndue in a very large measure to the absence of transport facilities and\r\nto mortality. However, some of the mines which had come into existence\r\nsubsequent to the discovery refused to be discouraged, and went on\r\nworking, more or less half-heartedly, notably in the Wassau and Takwa\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nIn January 1900 the scene changed, as though by a magician’s wand.\r\nThe man who waved it was a Mr. Stanley Clay, an engineer reputed of\r\nconsiderable ability, in the employ of the Consolidated Goldfields of\r\nSouth Africa, which Corporation had been approached by the men who owned\r\nthe Wassau and Takwa mines. This gentleman reported in effect that the\r\nbanket formation of the district he had been despatched to examine was\r\nso like the banket formation of the Rand as to be hardly distinguishable\r\nfrom the latter. Although some years previous to that report the Ashanti\r\nGoldfields Corporation, Limited—the parent, so to speak, of the Ashanti\r\nmines—had come into existence, I believe I am correct in stating that the\r\nremarkable “boom” in Gold Coast mining undertakings practically dates\r\nfrom the favourable report above alluded to.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, the last two years have witnessed the extraordinary\r\nmovement with which every one is familiar. According to “Wallach’s West\r\nAfrican Manual” for June 1901, 321 companies had at that time been\r\ncreated, with a total nominal share capital of £25,567,170. “The issued\r\nshare capital will amount to approximately £15,750,000, if all is fully\r\npaid up.”[310]\r\n\r\nThis is truly colossal. But all is not gold that glitters. The boom,\r\nprematurely, and to a large extent, dishonestly engineered, collapsed.\r\nDeep distrust has taken the place of sanguine anticipations, and public\r\nconfidence, greatly shaken, is apt to rush to the opposite extreme. The\r\nGold Coast mining industry has many enemies and many unwise friends. The\r\n“boom” was, of course, thoroughly unjustified. The public lost their\r\nheads completely. Company after company was formed, a large proportion\r\nof which hardly knew where their territory lay, let alone whether it\r\ncontained any gold. But the public did not care twopence so long as it\r\nwas a Gold Coast venture, and a great many rascals have done excellently\r\nwell out of the British investor. Finally, this constant flotation of\r\ncompanies got to be in the nature of a scandal; and the Governor of the\r\nGold Coast, in a courageous speech, which has remained famous, before the\r\nlocal Chamber of Commerce, and for which Sir Matthew Nathan deserves the\r\ngreatest possible credit, denounced the abuses which the movement was\r\ngiving rise to. Mr. Chamberlain promptly endorsed the Governor’s views,\r\nand caused a public statement to be made which fell like a bombshell on\r\nthe market-riggers. Flotation of new companies after that was an almost\r\nimpossible task, and the market received a staggering blow from which it\r\nhas not yet recovered. There is pretty certain to be renewed activity at\r\nsome not very distant day. Let us hope that the next time it will rest on\r\nsomething more tangible than fairy tales.\r\n\r\nThat gold exists in the Gold Coast is demonstrated beyond a shadow of\r\ndoubt. That it can be worked at a profit has yet to be satisfactorily\r\nproved, even in the case of the properties which are, or will be, in\r\nclose proximity to the railway now in course of construction. For the\r\npurposes of illustration the Gold Coast may be divided into three\r\nportions. First, where gold exists in such quantities—other conditions\r\nbeing favourable—that it is reasonable to believe the mines, if\r\neconomically and wisely administered, will become dividend-producing.\r\nSecondly, where gold exists, but not in sufficient quantities—the\r\nconditions of mining in West Africa being what they are—to enable the\r\nmines ever to become dividend-paying. Thirdly; where no gold exists at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nNow when it is borne in mind that options have been acquired by\r\nindividuals pretty well all over the country, and companies have been\r\nformed to work those options, it will be easily understood that shares of\r\na considerable number of existing companies are not worth the paper upon\r\nwhich they are inscribed. In my opinion, if Mr. Wallach’s “321” companies\r\nwere divided by six, the residue would be an optimistic prophecy as to\r\nthe number of Gold Coast mining companies existing ten years hence.\r\nThis number would be amply sufficient to allow of the Gold Coast to\r\nbecome, what I believe it will become, a gold-producing region of very\r\nconsiderable value. Personally, I am as equally convinced that some of\r\nthe mines will become good dividend-payers, as I am that the majority are\r\nrubbish. The two main difficulties which the mining industry in the Gold\r\nCoast have to face are climate and transport.\r\n\r\nThe first is a very real difficulty, and the public would do well to\r\ntreat with the utmost scepticism reports emanating from directors of\r\nGold Coast companies, especially those whose properties are situate near\r\nthe coast; who pooh-pooh the danger of the climate. If Major Ross’s\r\nindefatigable efforts are backed up by the authorities and the mining\r\ncompanies, we shall see a better state of things before many years are\r\npast. But that the climate will always be an adverse element to contend\r\nagainst is positively certain. Those who say the contrary are not dealing\r\nhonestly with the public.\r\n\r\nMany people imagine that transport difficulties will vanish when this\r\ncrawling single line to Kumasi has been completed. Let those who are\r\ninclined to that belief study one of the excellent maps of the Gold Coast\r\nmines now available, and see how many of the properties, out of the total\r\nof companies floated, approximate sufficiently to the line to feel its\r\nusefulness. Before transport difficulties can be said to be overcome, the\r\nGold Coast must be a network of railways. That may come, but the time is\r\nnot yet by a long, a very long way.\r\n\r\nThe alleged labour difficulty I have dealt with elsewhere. It is largely\r\nfictitious, as the most reputable companies and the most experienced\r\nEuropeans will bear witness. The boot, the stick; abuse; inadequate pay;\r\ndishonest dealing—so long as these incentives to labour exist on the\r\nGold Coast, and they exist to-day, so long will certain people endeavour\r\nto make the British public believe that labour is improcurable in West\r\nAfrica save by measures of coercion, or by Asiatic emigration, or by\r\ndraining the other West African colonies of their able-bodied men. Decent\r\nwages; just treatment; tactful dealing; a high type of representative—the\r\nmining companies which supply these have not, and will not have,\r\noccasion to complain. The Administration might play a useful part in\r\nimitating the French policy of obtaining labour for the Guinea Railway,\r\nviz. through the Chiefs, and through them alone, and refuse to allow\r\nauthorised or unauthorised recruiting agents.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the investing public, those who contemplate\r\nputting any money into the Gold Coast mines should carefully weigh\r\nthe difficulties mentioned against the counterbalancing reasons for\r\noptimism in the facts (1) that some undoubted experts, and some men of\r\nundoubted integrity and ability who have a reputation to lose, have\r\nstaked that reputation upon the existence of “paying” gold in the Gold\r\nCoast; (2) that a powerful corporation has undertaken a heavy liability\r\nin guaranteeing a certain sum for a number of years to the Gold Coast\r\nRailway; (3) that a very large sum of money has been sunk in the\r\ncountry for the purpose of mining enterprise; (4) that the past history\r\nof the Gold Coast is all in its favour. Finally, the investor should\r\ndiscriminate carefully between the companies and “groups” which are\r\njustifying, or honestly seeking to justify, their existence and those\r\nthat are not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPROXIMATE AREA AND POPULATION OF THE BRITISH WEST AFRICAN POSSESSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n    GAMBIA.

Inquiries are, however, being made, and on receipt of definite\r\ninformation his Majesty’s Government will be in a position to consider\r\nwhat action should be taken in the matter.”\r\n\r\nSince the above question by Sir Charles Dilke, the doubt as to the\r\nactual place of Mr. Rabinek’s arrest has been removed. The Congo State\r\nauthorities can no longer evade the point. Here is a copy of the\r\n_Procès-verbal d’arrestation_, showing conclusively that Mr. Rabinek was\r\narrested _on board a British vessel_.\r\n\r\n                   PROCÈS-VERBAL D’ARRESTATION.\r\n\r\n    Le soussigné, Saroléa, Louis, Sous-Lieutenant de la Force\r\n    Publique, commandant la colonne mobile du Tanganyka, stationnée\r\n    à Mpueto, officier de police judiciaire, a procédé le 15 Mai\r\n    1901, à 3 heures de l’après-midi, à l’arrestation du sieur\r\n    Rabinek en exécution du mandat d’arrêt délivré le 17 Décembre,\r\n    1900, à charge du dit Rabinek par le tribunal territorial\r\n    d’Albertville. _Le prénommé se trouvait à bord du steamer\r\n    anglais “Scotia,” ancré dans le port de Mpueto._ Le Sieur\r\n    Rabinek a été remis à M.

In doing so it showed itself\r\nthe indifferent servant of an indifferent public.\r\n\r\n[12] See, more particularly, Appendices and the chapter on the Finances\r\nof Nigeria.\r\n\r\n[13] “By the end of April 1900,” says the report for Southern Nigeria for\r\n1900, “twenty proclamations were passed.” I should be afraid to say how\r\nmany have been passed since.\r\n\r\n[14] The activity of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine has been\r\nphenomenal, and the useful work performed by it is internationally\r\nrecognised. To the splendid enterprise of Sir Alfred Jones, its initiator\r\nand President, is due the astonishingly strong financial position which\r\nthe School has attained—entirely the outcome of private benevolence.\r\n\r\n[15] In the remarkable speech he made at the Lagos Literary Institute—the\r\nmost able and statesmanlike oration ever delivered by a British official\r\nin West Africa—Sir William MacGregor said in reference to the extension\r\nof the Lagos Railway: “It would require probably not much greater\r\nexpenditure than would a number of military campaigns, it would save many\r\nvaluable lives to open up the country in that way, and it would leave a\r\npermanent valuable asset. In this the locomotive would be preferable to\r\nthe Maxim.”\r\n\r\n[16] That admirable German Institution, the _Kolonial Wirtschaftliches\r\nKomitee_ (Agricultural Committee) might also be imitated with advantage\r\nby our Government. Attached to the German Colonial Society, the\r\nAgricultural Committee devotes its exclusive attention to a study of the\r\neconomic resources of the German possessions, giving special notice to\r\ncocoa, rubber, gutta-percha, cotton, &c. Experts have been despatched\r\nby the Committee to the South Seas to study gutta-percha, to the States\r\nfor cotton, to Central and South America for cocoa, &c. The Committee\r\nis really composed of a trained body of agricultural and botanical\r\nspecialists working in the joint interests of the Government and the\r\nmerchants.\r\n\r\n[17] M. Empain has lately been granted by King Leopold a huge concession\r\nin the Aruwimi region of the Congo State in connection with the promotion\r\nof a railway to the Great Lakes.\r\n\r\n[18] The London Chamber being mainly—although not exclusively—concerned\r\nwith Gold Coast trade and mining developments.\r\n\r\n[19] It was entirely owing to the assistance of the African Association’s\r\nagents that the people of the Niger Delta were induced to accept British\r\nprotection and consular jurisdiction. By the merchants’ good offices,\r\nConsuls Johnston and Hewett were enabled to ascend the rivers to places\r\nwhere they would not have dared to enter unaccompanied by representatives\r\nof the merchants.\r\n\r\n[20] Chairman of the African Section.\r\n\r\n[21] Report of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, 1900.\r\n\r\n[22] Messrs. Shelford’s estimate is £7000 per mile. But this cannot be\r\nreconciled with the amount expended. It leaves out of account the cost of\r\nbridges between Lagos Island and the mainland, which are part and parcel\r\nof the railway scheme. In March of this year the Colony had already\r\nexpended its loan of £1,053,700, which works out at £8430 per mile. But\r\nalthough the railway has reached its present terminus it is not yet\r\nproperly finished. Speaking in March, Sir W. MacGregor foreshadowed a\r\nfurther expenditure of £60,000, and added, “the probability is, however,\r\nthat this will not be sufficient.” On the same occasion the Governor,\r\nreviewing the state of the Colony, said that one of the two “principal\r\ncauses of anxiety” was “the difficulty experienced in getting the railway\r\ninto working order.”\r\n\r\n[23] French Guinea borrowed £480,000 at the rate of 4.10 per cent. and 4\r\nper cent. respectively.\r\n\r\n[24] 14_s._ 8_d._ per head of the whole population of the territory.\r\n\r\n[25] Another incident of the kind is referred to by Sir W. MacGregor in\r\none of his speeches before the Legislative Council. Plans were sent home\r\nfor a steam-hopper or tramway to remove refuse. The plans were rejected\r\nby the “consulting engineers.” The Governor sarcastically remarked: “It\r\nis doubtful that any remedy that would cost less than £100,000 will ever\r\nbe approved by the engineers.”\r\n\r\n[26] The same belief was entertained, curiously enough, by the\r\ninhabitants of the Niger Basin itself even in Clapperton’s day, as\r\nwitness Sultan Bello’s map, drawn for Clapperton at the latter’s request,\r\nreferred to farther on.\r\n\r\n[27] Lyon subsequently gained Timbuctoo from Murzuk, being the second\r\nEuropean to visit the mysterious city. It has always remained an open\r\nquestion whether Horneman did not actually cross the Desert and reach\r\nthe Chad. Denham, indeed, believed that he did so, but no trace of the\r\nunfortunate German has ever been discovered from the time he left Murzuk,\r\nnearly a quarter of a century before Denham arrived there himself.\r\n\r\n[28] Caffre—_i.e._ unbeliever.\r\n\r\n[29] For instance, the Bahr-el-Ghazal, Bahr-el-Asrek, Bahr-el-Abiad, &c.,\r\nall rivers.\r\n\r\n[30] Some authors consider the Hausas to be a branch of the Mandingo\r\nrace. According to this theory, the Mandingoes are the parent stock,\r\nand the Hausas, Songhays, Bambarras, &c., are all offshoots of the\r\nsame great family. Although there would appear to be a certain basis\r\nof probability—especially as regards the Bambarras—in the plea of a\r\ncommon Mandingo origin, our historical and ethnological knowledge of the\r\ndifferent races of West Africa, which is still in the embryonic stage,\r\nprecludes anything in the nature of a positive assertion.\r\n\r\n[31] Subsequent to the final overthrow of the Berbers, under Kuseila, by\r\nthe Arabs in 688 A.D.\r\n\r\n[32] “Historical Account of the Kingdom of Tek-roor.” By Sultan Mohammed\r\nBello of Hoosa.

It is a most\r\ninteresting document. The Consul gives a table of the value of Tripoli’s\r\ntrade with the Central Sudan States (Sokoto, Bornu, Wadai) for the period\r\n1862-1901 as follows: 1862-71, £318,000; 1872-81, £1,846,300; 1882-91,\r\n£1,283,000; 1892-1901, £1,141,700; annual average, £114,725.\r\n\r\n[41] Consul Jago appears to favour this view. I venture to suggest that\r\nthe paragraphs (pp. 7 and 8) in which he refers to the point are open to\r\ncriticism. Take, for instance, the cost of transport. Notwithstanding\r\nthat, at first sight, the assertion may appear strange, I believe that,\r\nif any one cares to take the trouble to work out the cost of transport of\r\na ton of European merchandise from London to Kuka (1) _viâ_ Tripoli and\r\nby caravan across the desert, (2) _viâ_ Burutu, the Niger and overland,\r\nthe former route will be found the cheaper of the two. Things do not\r\nalways appear to be what they are in Africa. If France can come to a\r\nworking understanding with the Senussis, the caravan trade will revive.\r\n\r\n[42] According to Lieutenant-Colonel Pilcher, who commanded the West\r\nAfrican Frontier Force in 1898, the Hausa is more quarrelsome than the\r\nYoruba or Nupe, gets into trouble more often, and is not so quick at\r\npicking up drill or musketry (Colonial Office Report, No. 260, West\r\nAfrican Frontier Force, June 1899). Other officers eulogise the Hausas,\r\nand among military men they are, I think, believed to be superior\r\nfighters to either the West Indian or Mendi Negro, while about equalling\r\nthe Yoruba. The Negro seems to fight more fiercely and recklessly when he\r\nhas Islam to fall back upon.\r\n\r\n[43] “Géographie Universelle,” livre xii. p. 587. 1887.\r\n\r\n[44] “The Colonisation of Africa,” p. 282. 1899.\r\n\r\n[45] “Narrative of a Mission to Central Africa.”\r\n\r\n[46] “The Language of Bornu.”\r\n\r\n[47] “Magana Hausa.” By J.

On page 9 of the introduction to his book, Koelle speaks\r\nof the system of orthography followed by him as that of Professor\r\nLepsius, of Berlin, in the pamphlet entitled “Standard Alphabet for\r\nReducing _Unwritten Languages_ and Foreign Graphic Systems to a Uniform\r\nOrthography in European Letters.”\r\n\r\n[53] Baikie gives nine Hausa dialects, viz.: “Katshena, the purest and\r\nbest; (2) Kano; (3) Gober; (4) Daure; (5) Zamfara; (6) Zuzu; (7) Biranta\r\nGoboz; (8) Kabi; (9) Shira, or Shura.”—“Narrative of an Exploring Voyage\r\nup the Rivers Kwora and Binue.” By William Balfour Baikie. 1856.\r\n\r\n[54] It is found in French Guinea, north of Sierra Leone, but is not\r\nthere the staple product, rubber taking its place.\r\n\r\n[55] Southern Nigeria, or rather the Niger Delta, is commonly known as\r\n“the rivers.”\r\n\r\n[56] The figures for 1900 include the whole of Nigeria—that is, the\r\nformer Niger Company’s territories in the Lower Niger, and the Niger\r\nCoast Protectorate, now incorporated into Southern Nigeria.\r\n\r\n[57] _Idem._\r\n\r\n[58] Germany has a protective tax on kernel or other foreign crushed\r\noil, which enables her to keep the home market to herself, and she\r\nhas made a profitable use of the cake for feeding cattle, whilst our\r\nfarmers—largely, I understand, through the operation of the tenant-right\r\nconditions of tenure, or perhaps through mere prejudice—refuse to use it\r\nto any extent.\r\n\r\n[59] In Senegal and the Gambia the ground-nut industry, which is also\r\nessentially a native industry, takes its place, the number of palm-trees\r\nin those possessions being very scanty—not worth mentioning, in fact.\r\n\r\n[60] It is also used for lubricating mixtures for the axles of railway\r\ncarriages.\r\n\r\n[61] Giving out trust is not invariably confined to the European. Native\r\nchiefs have been known to give trust to Europeans up to 1000 cases of\r\npalm-oil, in days, too, when palm-oil was worth £15 per puncheon. This\r\nwould represent a credit of £15,000.\r\n\r\n[62] In point of fact, palm-oil from the Congo district is the richest in\r\nstearine.\r\n\r\n[63] The first West African kernels were imported in 1860 by Mr. A.\r\nMackenzie Smith and the late Mr. Charles Lane, of Liverpool. The Old\r\nCalabar district led the way in Southern Nigeria. The trade was begun\r\nthere in a small way in 1864. Benin was the next place in Southern\r\nNigeria to follow suit, and by 1867 the trade was fairly large. By 1880\r\nthe trade had spread to the other rivers, New Calabar, Bonny, Brass, and\r\nOpobo.\r\n\r\n[64] The average crushing of the African Oil Mills is, I believe, about\r\n600 tons weekly.\r\n\r\n[65] The exception is the machine erected at the Brass River in 1877 (by\r\nthe Count de Cardi, I believe) and used to this day by the firm which has\r\nthe principal trade of this district. It can produce, I believe, forty or\r\nfifty bags of clean kernels per day of ten hours. It would require 600 or\r\n700 pairs of hands to give this result in the same time.\r\n\r\n[66] I am given to understand that efforts to use hand-crushing machines\r\nare being made by a merchant firm in French Guinea.\r\n\r\n[67] An interesting account of this most valuable experiment is given by\r\nM. Pierre Mille in the _Journal of the African Society_ for October 1901.\r\n\r\n[68] Various types of hand-ploughs are now being experimented with\r\nin Senegal for the purpose of quickening production.—See _Journal\r\nd’Agriculture Tropicale_, September 1901.\r\n\r\n[69] Many people, on the other hand, will consider the somewhat elaborate\r\njudicial machinery set up in Northern Nigeria as distinctly premature.\r\nThe administration of English law in West African Protectorates (see\r\np. 16, Northern Nigeria Report), even when modified by native law\r\nand custom, is a feature of the Crown Colony system which has little\r\nto recommend it. Dr. Ballay’s plan in French Guinea was infinitely\r\npreferable. In all matters affecting the relations of natives with\r\nnatives Ballay insisted that native law should be the basis. He declined\r\nto introduce all the technicalities of European law among a people whose\r\nown laws are founded upon just principles, and, given security in their\r\napplication, work effectively and well.\r\n\r\n[70] August 1, 1891. It was first called Consular Jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n[71] Sir Ralph Moor has since declared that Southern Nigeria is in\r\n“a very sound financial position.” The test of sound finance must be\r\ndifferent in West Africa from any other part of the world.\r\n\r\n[72] Colonial Office Report, No. 315.\r\n\r\n[73] In that year Southern Nigeria spent £30,196 on military expenses\r\nand £8236 only on the “Aborigines” department. Under “Political\r\nand Administrative” expenses, £20,327 was absorbed; under “Marine\r\nDepartment,” £32,531; £24,654 only was spared for public works, but\r\n“Prisons” necessitated £7200, against £1171 under “Botanical” and £1147\r\nunder “Sanitary”!\r\n\r\n[74] In 1890 the value of exports from the Delta was estimated at over\r\n£1,300,000.\r\n\r\n[75] The Nupe campaign was undertaken after great provocation, and is\r\nunderstood to have been carried out with the approval, tacit or avowed,\r\nof the Emir of Sokoto, who had reason to complain of the Emir of Nupe’s\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\n[76] Similarly Nupe refused to have anything to do with Herr von\r\nPuttkamer in 1889 without consulting the Company, although the German (or\r\nhis interpreter) passed himself off as the “Queen of England’s messenger.”\r\n\r\n[77] Northern Nigeria.\r\n\r\n[78] “The Foundation of British East Africa.”\r\n\r\n[79] Colonial Report, No. 346, page 11, par. 2.\r\n\r\n[80] Lord John Russell’s Instructions to Captain Henry Dundas Trotter,\r\nCommander William Allen, Commander Bird Allen, and William Cook, Esquire,\r\nCommissioners for making and concluding agreements with the Chief Rulers\r\nof the Western Coast of Africa for the suppression of the traffic in\r\nslaves and the establishment of a lawful commerce, 1840.\r\n\r\n[81] The absence of any wish to “act otherwise” on the part of the native\r\nis invariably assumed in Europe, and but too often by Europeans in\r\nAfrica. In this connection the following passage from Clapperton (when\r\ntravelling in Nigeria) is worth noting: “It was with feelings of the\r\nhighest satisfaction that I listened to some of the most respectable of\r\nthe merchants, when they declared that; were any other system of trading\r\nadopted, they would gladly embrace it in preference to dealing in slaves.”\r\n\r\n[82] Archibald Constable & Co. 1898.\r\n\r\n[83] Not to be confounded with the King of Benin who massacred\r\nConsul-General Phillips.\r\n\r\n[84] Referring to domestic slavery in the Northern Territories of the\r\nGold Coast, the late Lieut.-Colonel Northcott, C.B., whose death was a\r\nsad blow to the Empire and to West Africa particularly, in his report\r\non those territories (Report on the Northern Territories of the Gold\r\nCoast—published by the Intelligence Division of the War Office in 1899),\r\nsays: “The every-day life of slaves differs in no respect from that\r\nof the free men. Ground is allotted to them, on which they are free\r\nto work for their own benefit, the rule generally being that they may\r\ntake two days out of every five for work on their own account. With the\r\naccumulated results of this labour they are at liberty to purchase their\r\nfreedom. The price demanded is not excessive, and ranges from £2 to £5,\r\naccording to locality; but so lightly does the yoke of slavery bear\r\nthat only a comparatively small proportion seek their emancipation by\r\nthis means. Slaves may marry, and are encouraged to do so, the children\r\nbecoming the property of the master. The apparent hardship of liability\r\nto sale is in reality not oppressive. The march to the new owner’s place\r\nof abode is free from any suggestion of cruelty or force; the slave\r\npartakes of his master’s food and shares his lodging, and he is certain\r\nof kind treatment on arriving at his destination.”\r\n\r\n[85] This is pidgeon-English, the Hausa for ivory tusk (_i.e._ piece of\r\nivory) being _hakorin_, or _hauwin giwa_.\r\n\r\n[86] Named in honour of Park, who is supposed to be the first European to\r\nhave noticed it.\r\n\r\n[87] And Lagos again since the opening of the railway.\r\n\r\n[88] Up to the present, however, shipments of this prepared latex have\r\nmet with scant success.\r\n\r\n[89] In the “Report of the Sierra Leone Company” (London: James Phillips,\r\nprinter, 1794) the following passage occurs, which most probably refers\r\nto the _Pendatesma butyracæ_. “Butter and tallow tree. This is common in\r\nlow lands about Freetown; it abounds with a juice resembling gambodge\r\nin taint and durability, which exudes after the least laceration, and\r\nbecomes more coagulated, viscous, and of a darker colour. The wood of\r\nthis tree is firm, and seems adapted to various economical purposes. The\r\nfruit is nearly oval, about twice the size of a man’s fist; the rind is\r\nthick, pulpy, and of a pleasant acid; in the inside are found from five\r\nto nine seeds of the size of the walnut, containing an oleaginous matter,\r\nextracted by the natives and used with their rice and other food.” A\r\ngentleman of my acquaintance who knows this tree, tells me he has seen it\r\ngrowing in Sierra Leone, so that there seems no reason why experiments\r\nsimilar to those undertaken in French Guinea should not be made in our\r\ncolony, which adjoins that French possession.\r\n\r\n[90] Known as “piassava” in the trade.

According to the curious\r\nand interesting records of Assid-el-Haji-Abd-Salam Shabiny, a Tunisian\r\nmerchant, the Sultan of Hausa imposed a tax of 2 per cent. on all\r\nproducts of the land. The people also paid a land tax, and certain duties\r\nwere exacted on all goods sold in the market-place (“Relation d’un voyage\r\nà Timbuctoo vers l’année 1787”).\r\n\r\n[104] A missionary has recently admitted that “To the Hausa what is in\r\nthe Koran is of God, and what is not in the Koran is not worth knowing.”\r\n\r\n[105] To-day, _Guinée française_.\r\n\r\n[106] This is explained by the unwillingness of the Fulani to allow\r\nunions between their women-folk and their Negro neighbours.\r\n\r\n[107] Recently translated into French by M.

In 1329 the\r\nMellians were driven from Timbuctoo by the pagan Mosis (the most powerful\r\npagan kingdom which ever arose in West Africa). The people of Melle\r\nreconquered the place, but were finally expelled by the Tuareg in 1433.\r\nMelle was subsequently overcome by the Songhay and fell to pieces.\r\n\r\n[110] Published by the Hakluyt Society.\r\n\r\n[111] We are indebted to M. Dubois for the first complete copy.\r\n\r\n[112] The reigning family says the _Tarik_ were white and their subjects\r\nWakoris (Mandingoes). This strengthens the Fulani argument, the\r\ncomplexion of the pure-blood Fulani inclining to white by comparison with\r\ntheir neighbours. In his “Notice Géographique sur la Région du Sahel”\r\n(which includes Bakunu, the former Baghena), Commandant Lartigue says of\r\nthe Fulani still inhabiting that district, “Quelques-uns sont presque\r\nblancs; leur cheveux sont à peine crépus, et ils ont les traits fins et\r\nréguliers des Européens de bonne race.”\r\n\r\n[113] The language of the Fulani.\r\n\r\n[114] The Empire which, as we have observed, was raised upon the ruins of\r\nGhanata by the Mandingoes, the subject race at the time of the latter’s\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\n[115] D’Eichtal’s assertion (“Les Foulahs.” Paris: 1842), that the\r\nFulani “to this day” call the whole of Senegambia “Melli,” I do not find\r\nconfirmed, but it is worth mentioning, nevertheless.\r\n\r\n[116] The first map in which Melle figures is a Spanish one (1375 A.D.).\r\nIn the map of Mathias de Villadestes, the Venetian (1413 A.D.), the word\r\n“Toucuzor” is written by the side of that of the King of Melli, “Mussa.”\r\nFor “Toucuzor” read “Toukulor” (Tukulor), the cross race of Fulani-Joloff\r\nand Fulani-Mandingo.—“Considérations sur la Priorité des Découvertes\r\nMaritimes sur la Côte Occidentale d’Afrique.”—Binger.\r\n\r\n[117] Barth’s chronological table of the Songhay.\r\n\r\n[118] Marmol—born in Granada, 1580—translated by Nicholas Perot\r\nd’Ablancourt.\r\n\r\n[119] The _Tarik’s_ statement that Salta Tayenda fled into “Futa” affords\r\nsubstantial indication of the presence of Fulani in that country at a\r\nprevious date, which we know, of course, from other sources.\r\n\r\n[120] This tradition obviously refers to Fulani pressure—the root of the\r\nword (Pul, or Ful) signifying red, or reddish.\r\n\r\n[121] A correspondent of a Paris paper, _La Dépêche Coloniale_, writing\r\nfrom Kunde, on the Sangha River, on December 10, 1901, says: “Our\r\nclothes, which are ragged from bush travelling, do not convey a great\r\nidea of our influence, especially when compared to the Fulbes (Fulani)\r\nin their embroidered cloths and leather riding-boots. They are all on\r\nhorseback and we are on foot. _There are thousands of them_, and all are\r\narmed.”\r\n\r\n[122] Their presence in Omdurman—that is to say, in the heart of the\r\nEastern Sudan in the Nile valley—has already been noted by Father\r\nOhrwalder. On page 300 of “Ten Years’ Captivity in the Mahdi’s Camp”\r\n(Major Wingate, R.A. London: 1895), we read, “Several of the Fellata, who\r\ncame from distant parts of Bornu, Wadai, &c., were stopped at Omdurman on\r\ntheir way to Mecca”; and again, on page 305, “The inhabitants of Omdurman\r\nare a conglomeration of every race and nationality in the Sudan—Fellata,\r\nTakruris, natives of Bornu, &c.”\r\n\r\n[123] Dr. Barth’s estimate as to the date of the foundation of Ghanata\r\nis certainly not exaggerated, in view of the _Tarik’s_ statement that\r\ntwenty-two kings had reigned before the Hejira.\r\n\r\n[124] Ernest Flammarion, Paris.

The two sides are stated with\r\ngreat clearness by the late Miss Kingsley in “West African Studies.”\r\n(Macmillan & Co.)\r\n\r\n[133] Lest it be supposed that I am appropriating other people’s ideas\r\nwithout acknowledgment, I hasten to add that Major Rennel, in his notes\r\non Park’s travels (“Travels in the Interior of Africa.” London: 1799)\r\nhazards the same suggestion, and Barth and Frey follow suit. But I think\r\nthat, in the light of our further knowledge of the peoples and history of\r\nWestern Africa, the identification of the “Leucæthiopes” with the Fulani\r\nbecomes a good deal more than a suggestion.\r\n\r\n[134] The cattle possessed by the Fulani—who are the herdsmen of West\r\nAfrica—are the hump-backed Asiatic kind (_Bos indicus_). That was a great\r\npoint with Faidherbe in favour of the Eastern theory. The Abyssinians’\r\ncattle, it may be observed, belong to the same breed.\r\n\r\n[135] “Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said: ‘My father and my\r\nbrethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are\r\ncome out of the land of Canaan, and, behold, they are in the land of\r\nGoshen.’”\r\n\r\n[136] Cattle-rearer.\r\n\r\n[137] “An Account of the Native Africans in the Neighbourhood of Sierra\r\nLeone.” By Thomas Winterbottom, D.D., Physician to the Colony of Sierra\r\nLeone. 1803.\r\n\r\n[138] The Joloffs (Senegal) declare that the Fulani converse habitually\r\nwith their cattle.\r\n\r\n[139] Moore, writing of the Gambia Fulani in the eighteenth century,\r\nsays, they manage cattle so well that the Mandingoes give them their own\r\nto look after.\r\n\r\n[140] Native cavalry soldier.\r\n\r\n[141] Related in the French African Committee’s journal.\r\n\r\n[142] De Guiraudon was, apparently, unaware of this passage, which has an\r\nimportant bearing upon his statements.\r\n\r\n[143] Not pear-shaped, as with the negress.\r\n\r\n[144] Barth, Baikie, Gray, Monteil, Mollien, De Giraudon, Callié, &c.,\r\nvie with one another in their enthusiasm over the beauty of the Fulani\r\nwoman of pure blood, which is all the more pronounced in view of their\r\nethnic surroundings. Barth speaks of young Fulani girls whose forms\r\n“recall the finest Grecian sculptury.” “The women are very beautiful, and\r\npossess strange powers of fascination in their large deep eyes,” says\r\nMonteil. “The women in particular,” remarks Gray, “might vie in point of\r\nfigure with the finest forms in Europe, and their walk is particularly\r\nmajestic.” “The Fulani women, many of whose countenances are resplendent\r\nwith a veritable beauty” (Reclus).\r\n\r\n[145] “West Africa.”\r\n\r\n[146] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[147] Witness, for example, the admirable work on land tenure on the\r\nIvory Coast just published by Administrator Clozel; also that gentleman’s\r\narticle in the _Journal of the African Society_ for July.\r\n\r\n[148] I have not yet heard of any departure from the rule.\r\n\r\n[149] “Modern ideas and legislation,” says Dr. Alfred Zimmerman, “forbid\r\nviolent proceedings. The natives should be taught to work by cultivating\r\nthe sentiment in them that it is their interest to do so. _Experience\r\nproves that protection of property is the surest means to attain that\r\nend._”\r\n\r\n[150] Paul Kollmann’s “The Victoria Nyanza” may be consulted in this\r\nconnection with advantage. The illustrations of domestic ornaments, of\r\nflasks, bark-boxes, drums, &c., constructed by the natives of Usukama and\r\nUkerewe show real beauty of design.\r\n\r\n[151] Sir Marshall Clarke’s recent report is instructive. Speaking of the\r\nnatives of Rhodesia, he says: “They work in the mines either from direct\r\npressure brought to bear upon them by the administration, a pressure only\r\nshort of force, or the necessity of earning enough to pay their taxes....\r\nThis,” continues Sir Marshall Clarke, “does not tend to make industry\r\nattractive”; and, he adds, “At present there is undoubtedly discontent\r\namong the natives.”\r\n\r\n[152] “The evidence available seems to indicate that the labour\r\ndifficulty on the Gold Coast may probably be overcome without the\r\nimportation of labourers from other countries, and that success or\r\nfailure in the matter is largely dependent on the person in charge of the\r\nundertaking. It is very desirable that the persons in charge should be\r\ngentlemen and men of education, as it is found that such are more likely\r\nto be able to deal satisfactorily with the natives, who generally require\r\nto be handled with much tact and judgment.”—Par. 9, “Labour Ordinance”:\r\nissued by Colonial Office.\r\n\r\n[153] “According to native ideas there is no land without owners. What is\r\nnow a forest or unused land will, as years go on, come under cultivation\r\nby the subjects of the Stool, or members of the village community, or\r\nother members of the family” (“Fanti Customary Law,” J. M. Sarbah). What\r\nholds good in the Gold Coast is equally applicable to the rivers and to\r\nLagos, indeed throughout West Africa, wherever Negro culture is met with.\r\n\r\n[154] In order, of course, to do away with the idea that there is any\r\nwish or desire on the part of the Government to alienate the land from\r\nthe rightful owners thereof.\r\n\r\n[155] The amended Lagos Bill exempts from its operation native\r\ncustomary rights and defers to the authority of the Native Councils\r\nof the hinterland. Its working depends largely, therefore, upon the\r\ninterpretation placed by the Colony’s Governor for the time being on the\r\nnature of the relationship between those Councils and the Administration.\r\nSir W. MacGregor has passed a Bill (the Native Councils Bill) which, he\r\nthinks, will strengthen the position of the Councils. But it is safe to\r\nsay that, in all matters affecting land legislation in West Africa, the\r\nprocedure for safeguarding native rights, and in their main lines those\r\nrights themselves, should be laid down as clearly as possible in the Act\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n[156] For an intelligent native view on the subject the reader is\r\nreferred to the speeches of Dr. O. Johnson, Member of the Legislative\r\nCouncil of Lagos, in moving the rejection of the Amended Forest Ordinance\r\n(May 1902). Dr. Johnson’s status in the Colony may be estimated from\r\nthe fact that the extraordinarily able historical address on the native\r\nhistory of Lagos, delivered by him at the Lagos Institute last year, was\r\npublished as a Government paper in the Colony.\r\n\r\n[157] Who, for some time past, has individually done much to stimulate\r\ncotton-growing for export in West Africa.\r\n\r\n[158] In the manifesto issued by the Association in October there figures\r\na list of Vice-presidents, headed by Sir Alfred Jones, K.C.M.G., and\r\nincluding no less than twenty-two members of Parliament, among whom one\r\nnotices such well-known names as Winston S. Churchill, R. Yerburgh,\r\nAlfred Emmott, Sir William Mather, Lord Stanley, the Hon. Arthur Stanley,\r\nthe Hon. W. R. W. Peel, C. A. Cripps, K.C. J. H. Whitley, Sir J.

Johnston’s and Mr. Grogan’s discoveries have recently\r\nemphasised this fact.\r\n\r\n[168] Now Southern Nigeria.\r\n\r\n[169] And, say the merchants engaged in the trade, to high freights.\r\n\r\n[170] The American demand is, I understand, increasing.\r\n\r\n[171] C. O. Report, No. 348.\r\n\r\n[172] For a technical explanation read the following: “The extremely high\r\nprices obtained here for figured logs have naturally excited shippers,\r\nespecially native traders, and all are desirous to learn what constitutes\r\nfigure.... This is a subject difficult to elucidate, but we may say that\r\n‘roe’ may be described as the curved direction the grain of the wood\r\ntakes by one ring overlapping the other; to be of any value, beyond\r\nordinary plain wood, it must be of a very pronounced and bold character.\r\nThis gives the required variation of light and shade.”\r\n\r\n[173] The conversion of several hundred natives to Islam at Jebu-Ode, one\r\nof the large Yoruba centres in close proximity to Lagos, and where the\r\nChurch has laboured for years, is a recent incident which points in the\r\ndirection stated.\r\n\r\n[174] _Tarik._\r\n\r\n[175] Kanem at the time ruled over what was known later as Bornu.\r\n\r\n[176] Makrizi attributes the introduction of Islam into Kanem to Hadi el\r\nOthman, who was probably of Fulani origin, although Makrizi does not say\r\nso.\r\n\r\n[177] Timbuctoo was not founded until about seventy years after the\r\nconversion of Za Kasai.\r\n\r\n[178] The theory which gives an Eastern origin to Mohammedan proselytism\r\nin Kanem seems unworthy of consideration.\r\n\r\n[179] The manatee is the _ayu_ of the Fulani, and its signification—viz.\r\nthat of a mythical creature living in the water and dragging any one in\r\nwho sees it—seems to argue the existence of an ancient superstition.\r\nIn various parts of the Niger and Binue this strange animal is still\r\nregarded with a certain awe, which, however, does not prevent it from\r\nbeing slaughtered, both for its flesh and skin. The Soninke legend of the\r\nwater serpent, which each year claimed the handsomest girl of the village\r\nas a victim, would seem to bear a distinct relation to this, the former\r\n_ayu_ worship of the Songhays.\r\n\r\n[180] Binger suggests that the word Mande, or Mandingo, is derived from\r\nthe same root as manatus, and signifies the people of a country where the\r\nmanatus is worshipped.\r\n\r\n[181] “Mungo Park.” Joseph Thomson.

My\r\nreverend friend found in that striking fact (for the truth of which he\r\nvouched, and he is a truthful man) a justification of his view that a\r\nlarge proportion of Liberians, that is to say, the descendants of the\r\nblacks from the States, led indolent and unhealthy lives. To my mind, it\r\nconveys an eloquent demonstration, that _on West African soil_ monogamy\r\nfor the Negro spells race extinction. Naturally my friend would not\r\nadmit the conclusion, although in his heart of hearts I believe he is\r\nrather troubled on the subject. But he recognised—and admitted—in course\r\nof conversation that polygamy was a question which the Church, in her\r\nwork among tropical peoples, had now to resolutely face and earnestly\r\ndiscuss. There is, I fear, no doubt that the monogamist—or professing\r\nmonogamist—Liberians are, like the Waganda, dying out.\r\n\r\n[198] Politically, the same attitude is adopted by the British\r\nauthorities; and in the case of the Sierra Leone Hut-tax war, and\r\nthe Forest Ordinances in Lagos, it has been sought to divorce the\r\neducated—and mainly, professing Christian—element of the coast from\r\ncommunity of thought, sympathy, and common racial feelings with the\r\nnon-educated, and mainly pagan or Mohammedan, element of the interior.\r\n\r\n[199] “As soon as half a dozen missionaries leave Liverpool,” writes the\r\nsame authority, Archbishop Dobson, “no end of a stir is made about the\r\ndevoted party, and so forth. I do not mean to be sarcastic about the\r\nmissionaries, but it does make one a trifle ashamed at times to meet a\r\nstalwart trader hereabouts on an occasion, who has been coming here off\r\nand on for twenty years, and his chief business is palm-oil, and his best\r\nview a mangrove swamp.”\r\n\r\n[200] It is even admitted to be harmful by Sir Alfred Jones, whose\r\nsteamers carry a large proportion of this liquor to West Africa, and\r\nby a large proportion of the merchants who deal in it. The merchants\r\nare sometimes violently attacked on account of this trade. Personally,\r\nI detest the West African liquor traffic. I look upon it in the same\r\nlight as the opium traffic in the Far East—a blot upon the escutcheon\r\nof Christian Europe. But those who denounce the merchants might just\r\nas well, and more logically, denounce the Governments. _Per se_ the\r\nliquor traffic is not a lucrative trade to the merchant, but to the\r\nlocal administrations on the coast it is the backbone of revenue. I was\r\nnever able to share the late Miss Kingsley’s views on this subject,\r\nwhile fully agreeing with her as to the inanity of making the merchants\r\nthe scapegoats of an evil the responsibility for which is, in a sense,\r\nuniversal. Despite anything that may be said to the contrary, I shall\r\nbelieve that a powerful factor in determining Miss Kingsley’s views was\r\nthe knowledge that, but for the existence of the liquor traffic as a\r\nsupplier of revenue, direct taxation would be substituted throughout\r\nBritish West Africa owing to the extravagance of the Crown Colony system;\r\nand I know that Miss Kingsley strongly objected to the introduction of\r\nEuropean spirits into the interior regions by means of the railways. The\r\nliquor question would require a special chapter to adequately discuss.\r\n\r\n[201] He will, no doubt, be edified to learn that the Cape Government has\r\nfound it necessary to pass a law imposing a severe term of imprisonment\r\nupon white _women_ convicted of sexual intercourse with the natives—a\r\ncircumstance not precisely calculated to increase his respect for our\r\nChristian civilisation.\r\n\r\n[202] Captain—now Commandant—Binger has for some little time past been\r\nin charge of the African Department of the French Colonial Office. His\r\ntravels, books, and pamphlets are familiar to every student of Western\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\n[203] It would seem now that they have temporarily prevailed with the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n[204] In the Sokoto Empire (Hausa States) more particularly.\r\n\r\n[205] They did it so well that, after the failure of their attack upon\r\nthe French camp, they denuded the country of supplies and reduced the\r\nexpedition to terrible straits for a time.\r\n\r\n[206] The fall predicted, and officially foreseen, in 1901 has come\r\nabout, owing to the rubber crisis. The measures taken during the last\r\nfifteen months to stimulate fresh industries in the country, and the\r\nadvance of the railway, will, no doubt, make themselves felt in the next\r\ntwo or three years.\r\n\r\n[207] For the Lagos exports and expenditure, see Appendix.\r\n\r\n[208] C.O. Report. 1900.\r\n\r\n[209] “Rapport d’ensemble.” Dahomey, 1900.\r\n\r\n[210] For 1902, on a total estimated expenditure of £121,560, Dahomey\r\nprovides £32,000 for the railway and £11,911 for public works ordinary\r\nor, say, a total of £43,911 for railway and public works.\r\n\r\n[211] The following statistics of the export trade of Dahomey, compiled\r\nfrom figures recently obtained, are interesting:\r\n\r\n                         QUANTITIES IN KILOS.\r\n                       (1015 kilos to the ton.)\r\n\r\n                          Palm-kernels.

All the ground-nuts go to the Continent—both from Senegal and\r\nGambia—the oil extracted, therefrom, or the bulk of it, is used in making\r\nmargarine, which is subsequently consumed, to a very large extent,\r\nby the English people! Why have we not our own crushing-mills? Is it\r\nbecause we are short of milk? It cannot but strike one as peculiar and\r\nunfortunate that we should send our West African ground-nuts to France,\r\nand afterwards buy from the French the oil the nuts yield for our own\r\nconsumption! Ground-nuts will grow anywhere in West Africa, and the\r\nlabour involved in cultivating them is very small.\r\n\r\n[216] Belgian syndicates have been trying, and are still trying, to\r\nget hold of the French Ivory Coast goldfields. Hitherto they have been\r\ndefeated by the vigilance of the French merchants; but there is no\r\nknowing what may happen in view of the extraordinary influence which King\r\nLeopold appears to wield over the French official world.\r\n\r\n[217] “Sur des traces probables de civilisation Egyptienne et d’hommes de\r\nrace blanche à la Côte d’Ivoire.” Masson & Cie., Paris. A pamphlet which\r\nought to be read by all students of West Africa.\r\n\r\n[218] Specie is usually included in the trade figures—a very misleading\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n[219] Sir David Chalmers’ report, p. 169.\r\n\r\n[220] Like the Susus, for example, who are very numerous in French\r\nGuinea, but of whom a few only have settled in the British Protectorate\r\nadjoining.\r\n\r\n[221] Let it not be imagined that the contrast here made between French\r\npolitical action in Dahomey and British political action in Ashanti\r\nimplies approval of direct taxation _per se_. It is ever a dangerous\r\nexperiment in West Africa, especially with pagans, even if conquest has\r\nsupervened. If the system under which the taxes are collected is not\r\ncarefully watched, grave abuses are almost certain to follow. Quite\r\nrecently rumours of oppression in the taxation of the natives in Upper\r\nDahomey have appeared in the French Press. What truth there may be in\r\nthem I do not know. But it is true, I believe, that the excellent staff\r\nwhom Governor Ballot gathered round him has left the Colony since Ballot\r\nleft it, and has been replaced by less experienced and less competent\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\n[222] Last Ashanti Blue Book, 1902.\r\n\r\n[223] See Note in Appendix.\r\n\r\n[224] See the evidence of Lieutenant-Colonel Gore, Colonial Secretary for\r\nSierra Leone. Sir David Chalmers’ report.\r\n\r\n[225] Between July 1894 and February 1898 no fewer than sixty-two\r\nconvictions—admittedly representing a small proportion of offences\r\nactually committed—were recorded against them for flogging, plundering,\r\nand generally maltreating the natives.\r\n\r\n[226] One of the pet arguments of the authorities consists in invoking\r\nthe benefits which have accrued to the people of the Protectorate since\r\nthe passing of the Protectorate Ordinance in the matter of putting down\r\nthe slave trade. For these benefits the natives, says officialdom, ought\r\nto be delighted to pay a tax. Possibly they would have paid it in time,\r\nmore or less willingly, had they been approached in a different spirit.\r\nBut, so far as the slave trade is concerned, the argument is singularly\r\nweakened by the circumstance that Sir F. Cardew publicly declared in\r\n1895 that the slave traffic had “practically disappeared within the\r\nProtectorate.”\r\n\r\n[227] The French West African Company, _Cie française de l’Afrique\r\nOccidentale_, is the largest French firm of African merchants in West\r\nAfrica. Founded in 1887 with a capital of 7,000,000 francs; total\r\nturn-over in 1899, 22,000,000 francs; factories in Senegal, French and\r\nPortuguese Guinea, Gambia, Sierra Leone, Lagos, and Ivory Coast.\r\n\r\n[228] In 1900, 39,874,005 francs; in 1901, 43,965,950 francs.\r\n\r\n[229] The same game was tried with the Germans in Cameroons. To quote\r\nfrom an article in the _National Zeitung_, which, as I have reason to\r\nknow, may be accepted as authorised: “If in the Congo State itself the\r\nBerlin Act could be disregarded in this way, and the natives obliged to\r\nbring in the produce against their will, why could it not also be done\r\nin other places? And as the Congo State was itself making the best use\r\nof its monopoly, and only gave concessions to others at high prices, the\r\nmonopolists tried, and not without result, to obtain the same state of\r\naffairs both in France and in Germany. In Germany, the German Colonial\r\nSociety at once protested against this state of affairs. In spite of\r\nthis, however, several of the Belgian capitalists were able to obtain the\r\nhelp of influential German persons, who obtained from the Government the\r\nconcession of South Cameroon. This company had obtained the assistance\r\nof Colonel Thys for its operations on the Brussels Stock Exchange, and\r\nimmediately after the flotation of the company the shares were driven up\r\nto two or three times their value. Further concessions in the free-trade\r\nzone were not conceded, and, with the exception of the North-West\r\nCameroon concession, in consequence of the energetic opposition in\r\ncolonial circles, no further concessions were, or will be, made in the\r\nGerman territories. The German Government has entirely abandoned this\r\npolicy of concessions.”\r\n\r\n[230] It is, of course, no easy matter to get at the precise\r\nconstitution of these companies, but the following example of one of\r\nthe “groups” is typical of the majority of them. _Comptoir Colonial\r\nfrançais._ Parent company: head offices, Paris; has founded at least six\r\nConcessionnaire Companies, of a total capital of 9,650,000 francs; Board\r\nof Administration numbers six directors, of whom three are Belgians;\r\ntwo-thirds of the shares held in Belgium; two of the Belgian directors\r\nare directors of the four _Domaine Privé_ Companies in the Congo State,\r\nwhose profits are shared by the State (read the King); the third also\r\nbelongs to the Congo clique; among the Belgian shareholders are other\r\ndirectors of these same _Domaine Privé_ Companies, all men enjoying\r\nthe confidence of, and closely connected with, the Sovereign of the\r\nCongo State. One of the six Concessionnaire Companies of this “group”\r\nhas specially distinguished itself in the persecution to which British\r\nmerchants have been subjected—discussed in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n[231] Some light has been thrown upon its African chapters by Mr. R. E.\r\nDennett, an Englishman in French Congo, and a recognised authority on the\r\nFjort peoples, in “West Africa.”\r\n\r\n[232] I should say now, ex-Deputy.\r\n\r\n[233] “Une idée domine l’ensemble du système, tous les produits du\r\nterritoire, concédé quels qu’ils soient, sont la propriété de la Société\r\nConcessionnaire. Seuls les agents de cette Société ont le droit de les\r\nrecueillir ou de les acheter des indigènes qui les ont récoltés; ces\r\nderniers ne pouvant disposer librement que des produits des reserves qui\r\nleur ont été spécialement attribuées et sur lesquelles je reviendrai, et\r\ndevant en thèse générale, lorsqu’ils s’emparent d’un produit quelconque\r\ndu sol en dehors de ces reserves, les remettre aux concessionnaires dont\r\nl’intérêt bien entendu, est de remunérer ensuite leur travail.”\r\n\r\n[234] “Les indigènes ont droit aux superficies qui leur sont nécessaires\r\npour les cultures vivrières correspondantes aux besoins de leur\r\nalimentation. On peut leur attribuer une certaine étendue de forêt\r\nnécessaire à leurs besoins de chauffage et de construction, mais ils\r\nn’ont pas droit a réclamer des forêts domaniales _dans le but de\r\nfaire commerce de leurs produits naturels_ et de constituer ainsi une\r\nconcurrence ruineuse pour le concessionnaire” (Art. 18).\r\n\r\n[235] The French Government has recently voted De Brazza an annual\r\npension of 10,000 francs.\r\n\r\n[236] “Concessions Congolaises.” By Albert Cousin, Membre du Conseil\r\nSupérieur des Colonies. Paris: Augustin Chalamel.\r\n\r\n[237] An English trader, Mr. Walker, was the first to do so. He is\r\nadmitted by French writers to have discovered the Ogowe.\r\n\r\n[238] Messrs. John Holt & Co. and Messrs. Hatton & Cookson, both of\r\nLiverpool, and both connected with the West African Trade for upwards of\r\nhalf a century. Mr. John Holt is probably the most enterprising pioneer\r\nof Britain’s trade in West Africa, possessing trading stations in most of\r\nthe British and Foreign West African Colonies. He is the vice-chairman\r\nof the African Trade Section of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, and\r\nvery few men living have so wide a grasp of West African questions or so\r\nprofound a knowledge of West African problems.\r\n\r\n[239] Whose existence was unknown in England until towards the end of\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\n[240] Seizure of British goods on public roads; breaking open of British\r\nfactories; flogging of British native agents, &c.\r\n\r\n[241] Notably that most excellent monthly, _Le Bulletin du Comité\r\nde l’Afrique française_, through the instrumentality of the two\r\ndistinguished thinkers and writers who dictate its policy, Count Robert\r\nde Caix and M. Auguste Terrier.\r\n\r\n[242] Forty tons of ebony, bought in the usual way by a British firm on\r\nthe Congo and shipped to Havre in a French ship, were seized at that\r\nport (1902) on a mandate of a Concessionnaire Company. This produce has,\r\nhowever, now been restored.\r\n\r\n[243] The Foreign Office was warned as far back as the beginning of 1898\r\nby the Manchester Chamber of Commerce of the danger of the possible\r\ninauguration of a system of territorial monopolies. Lord Salisbury said\r\nit would receive “our most earnest attention,” and admitted inferentially\r\nthat in fiscal questions England had, as a free-trade country, “inferior”\r\nmeans of influencing other countries; “with the occasional exception,”\r\nadded his lordship, “of territorial concessions, we have no means\r\nwhatever of persuasion.” Nevertheless, in the purely fiscal question\r\nwhich formed the principal object of the Deputation of Chambers of\r\nCommerce to Lord Salisbury on this occasion, that of the differential\r\ntariff in the French possessions, Lord Salisbury was able to get his\r\nown way, simply by persuasion, by “influencing France’s ideas.” Yet in\r\nthis matter of the French Congo Concessions, in which the purely fiscal\r\nquestion does not enter at all, and where we have an international treaty\r\nto work on, Lord Lansdowne has been unable to prevent the expulsion of\r\nBritish merchants from an internationally free-trade zone!\r\n\r\n[244] The _Morning Post_, the _Manchester Guardian_, the _Liverpool Daily\r\nPost_, and _West Africa_.\r\n\r\n[245] The German merchants, despairing of obtaining even the most\r\nelementary justice, have evacuated the territory. Our merchants have\r\nchosen the nobler part of making a stand for their rights, guaranteed\r\nunder international law.\r\n\r\n[246] To which must now be added the somewhat similar Rabinek affair—an\r\nAustrian subject arrested and “removed” by the Congo State in the Katanga\r\ndistrict under circumstances analogous, in some measure, to the case of\r\nMr. Stokes.\r\n\r\n[247] The other day the then French Parliamentary representative of\r\nSenegal, in a speech to his constituents at St. Louis, warned them that\r\nthe greatest danger threatening their hinterland, the French Sudan, was\r\nKing Leopold of Belgium and his monopolist gang.\r\n\r\n[248] At the great “Colonial Congress” held in Berlin on October 11,\r\nConsul Vohsen moved a resolution, unanimously carried, calling upon the\r\nPowers to institute proceedings for the revision of the Berlin Act.\r\nConsul Vohsen said: “From the very first the Congo State, and recently\r\nFrance in the French Colony of French Congo, have acted against the\r\nprinciples laid down in the Congo Act.” ... Referring to the Congo\r\nState, he continued: “All so-called countries ‘not occupied by natives’\r\nsituated in the Free Trade zone were, as far back as July 1885, declared\r\nthe property of the State, and in the year 1892 heavy taxes were imposed\r\nupon the rubber trade, which was entirely prohibited in parts of the\r\nFree Trade zone. The consequence was that the freedom of trade and\r\ncommerce guaranteed by the Congo Act was practically abolished. The first\r\ncondition of freedom of trade for the nations is freedom to the natives,\r\nin such a way as to leave them free to dispose of the natural products\r\nof the soil and of the chase; which state of affairs existed before the\r\npassing of the Act in all French, English, and German colonies in West\r\nAfrica, and exists to-day, with the exception of the territories of the\r\nCongo State and the French Congo, the very colonies where, strange to\r\nsay, free trade is insisted upon by Articles I. and V. of the Act.”\r\n\r\n[249] Among the supporters of the Mansion House meeting of May 15\r\n(held under the auspices of the Aborigines Protection Society) were\r\nMr. John Morley, Sir J. Kennaway, Earl Spencer, the Marquis of Ripon,\r\nLord Avebury, Mr. Lecky, M.P., Sir Edward Clarke, K.C., Sir W. Brampton\r\nGurdon, M.P., K.C.M.G., Sir Charles Dilke, M.P., Sir Mark J. Stewart,\r\nM.P., Mr. James Bryce, M.P., Mr. W. S. Robson, M.P., and other\r\npoliticians of both parties. Five Chambers of Commerce, the African\r\nSociety, and the German Colonial Society were represented, and Dr. Alfred\r\nZimmermann, _attaché_ to the German Embassy in London, also attended.\r\n\r\n[250] Commandant Binger’s views are well known. M. Cousturier (Governor\r\nof French Guinea), in his report on French Guinea for 1901, does not\r\nconceal his adverse opinion of Belgian methods of collecting rubber in\r\nthe Congo State.\r\n\r\nThe author could produce documentary evidence showing that similar\r\nopinions are held by other well-known French officials in West Africa.\r\n\r\n[251] Belgium, Great Britain, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy and\r\nRussia sent delegates to the conference.\r\n\r\n[252] This was done with the exception of England.\r\n\r\n[253] Diego Cam.\r\n\r\n[254] The original title had by this time been changed to that of\r\n“International Congo Association.”\r\n\r\n[255] The point is brought out very clearly by Mr. Dennet, our only\r\nauthority on the Fjort Kingdom of Congo, and the author of several books\r\nconcerning the Fjort, in a series of interesting letters published\r\nlast year in “West Africa.” Mr. Dennet, who has lived twenty-two years\r\nconsecutively in the Lower Congo, positively declares that the treaties\r\nmade by the Association, and referred to by General Sandford, had no\r\nvalidity whatever in native law.\r\n\r\n[256] In his report on the Congo State for 1898, Consul Pickersgill\r\nconcludes a long enumeration of the taxes levied upon independent trade\r\nby the following humorous passage:\r\n\r\n“I may sum up this portion of my remarks by quoting the jocose\r\nobservations of the English and American missionaries, who declared to\r\nme that there is nothing free in the Independent State, except fevers;\r\nwhile a Belgian Father with whom I had some conversation on the subject,\r\nremarked: ‘The Government taxes even the civilisation we bring.’”\r\n\r\n[257] Who held the monopoly of the ivory trade in the Upper Congo, which\r\nthe Congo State, by exterminating them with the aid of its cannibal\r\nsoldiery (see Hinde’s “Fall of the Congo Arabs”), became possessed of.\r\n\r\n[258] See Mr. Herbert Ward’s “Five Years with the Congo Cannibals,” p.\r\n297.\r\n\r\n[259] The whole paragraph might have been written a few weeks, instead\r\nof eleven years, ago. The state of affairs pictured by Colonel Williams\r\nhas worsened instead of bettered. The evil is more widespread and the\r\nmeans of perpetuating it more extensive and more powerful. Read in this\r\nconnection the latest revelations by Mr. Canisius and Captain Burrows.\r\n\r\n[260] The importance of the 10 per cent. import duty was purposely\r\nexaggerated. The amount derived therefrom was trifling. The merchants\r\nobjected to it on principle. As Sir Albert Rollit justly remarked,\r\n“The reason for our opposition is only that they (the import duties)\r\nwould infringe the great principle of freedom of commerce, which was\r\nthe very basis of the programme of the Berlin Conference.” It is quite\r\nclear, however, that the majority of the merchants also opposed the\r\nimport duties from a vague distrust of the king’s ultimate intentions, a\r\ndistrust which events proved to be only too well founded.\r\n\r\n[261] The map published by the African Society in the May (1902) issue of\r\nits Journal may be consulted with advantage in this respect.\r\n\r\n[262] Among whom might be mentioned Augouard, Hinde, Glave, Morrison,\r\nHawkins, Sheppard, Andrew, Sjöblom, Alfred Parminter, De Mandat-Grancy,\r\nRankin, Murphy, Lloyd, Grogan, and many others, without counting Belgian\r\nauthorities—more numerous than all foreigners put together.\r\n\r\n[263] At the present moment heavy fighting is going on in the Welle\r\ndistrict, due, as I have reason to know, to the usual rubber taxes. The\r\nfacts as to this particular rising may, happily, have been made public\r\nbefore the publication of the present volume.\r\n\r\n[264] The regular army—_Force Publique_—of the Congo State is admitted\r\nofficially (Bulletin, July 1900) to be 15,000, but we know that in\r\naddition to this regular force—15,000 cannibals armed with Albinis,\r\nsections of whom are continually revolting—the State habitually arms,\r\nwhenever it deems necessary, thousands of irregulars, cannibals for\r\nchoice (see the letter written in October 1899 to the king by the acting\r\nhead of the American Presbyterian Mission in the Kassai district). There\r\nis also a large reserve corps, but the extent of it is not known.\r\n\r\n[265] It may be usefully noted here that the _impôts de nature_ are\r\napplied by the Congo State in the so-called Free Trade Zone as well as\r\nin the _Domaine Privé_, and until the Kassai district was incorporated\r\nin the _Domaine Privé_ many and bitter were the complaints by companies\r\noperating in the former zone of the unfair competition to which they were\r\nsubjected by the levying of this tribute. Instances have been given by\r\nsome of these irate traders where the State’s officials have threatened\r\nthe natives with condign punishment if they did not hand over all their\r\nrubber to the said officials. An arrangement has recently been concluded\r\nbetween the State and the Kassai companies—the Kassai district was\r\nthe only portion of the Upper Congo where independent trade had been\r\nallowed—whereby the Kassai companies have amalgamated into a syndicate\r\n_in which the State holds one half the interest_. To all intents and\r\npurposes, therefore, the Kassai has now been incorporated in the _Domaine\r\nPrivé_, WHICH HENCEFORTH EMBRACES THE WHOLE OF THE CONGO STATE NORTH OF\r\nSTANLEY POOL.\r\n\r\n[266] Both these facts have been repeatedly asserted. They were proved\r\nbeyond manner of doubt last year by the disclosures attendant upon the\r\nMongolla scandals, in which agents of the _Société Anversoise_ were\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\n[267] Seven, if we include the Kassai Trust recently formed.\r\n\r\n[268] Baron A. Goffinet is “Conseiller de Légation, Secrétaire des\r\nCommandements de leurs MM. le Roi et la Reine, Major de l’Etat, Major de\r\nla Garde Civique, Aide-de-camp, Ministre Résident.” Baron C. Goffinet is\r\n“Conseiller de Légation, Intendant de la Liste Civile du Roi, Ministre\r\nRésident, Major de la Garde Civique.”\r\n\r\n[269] I have quite recently received from another correspondent in the\r\nCongo the photograph here reproduced.\r\n\r\n[270] “Abir (Société à responsabilité limitée) Statuts.” Anvers:\r\nImprimerie Ratinckx Frères, Grand Place, 40-42.\r\n\r\n[271] “Comptoir Commercial Congolais (Société à responsabilité limitée)\r\nStatuts.” Anvers: Imprimerie Ratinckx.\r\n\r\n[272] “Compagnie du Lomami (Société Anonyme) Statuts.” Bruxelles: P.\r\nWeissenbruch, Imprimerie du Roi, 45 rue du Poincon.\r\n\r\n[273] In chapter xxviii.

Well, Alexis Mols is one of the\r\nAdministrators, and so is A. Osterrieth, a shareholder in the _Abir_, and\r\nso is A. Lambrechts, also a shareholder in the _Abir_, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n[274] I am afraid Sir H. M. Stanley was somewhat premature when, in 1884,\r\nhe told the London Chamber of Commerce that people “could not appreciate\r\nrightly” King Leopold’s philanthropy, because there were “no dividends\r\nattaching to it.”\r\n\r\n[275] Whip made out of hippo hide—the Congo _sjambok_.\r\n\r\n[276] Or was until quite recently.\r\n\r\n[277] In Congo circles in Belgium it is suggested that to guard against\r\n“attacks which might become too threatening” (by “attacks” is meant\r\nexposures in the public Press, and on public platforms in England and\r\nGermany) the Congo State should largely increase its standing army.\r\n\r\n[278] The author, who may claim to have brought the Rabinek affair to\r\nlight, is able to state that the British Government is causing specific\r\ninquiries to be made through its representatives in Central Africa in\r\nconnection with the matter. See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[279] The trade of the Lower Congo has sensibly diminished since the\r\nCongo State came into existence. On August 10 of last year the merchants\r\nestablished in the Lower Congo (of whom there remain a few) petitioned\r\nthe king to reduce taxation. After pointing out the heavy import and\r\nexport duty on goods and produce (20_s._ per ton on palm-oil, for\r\ninstance) and showing how small the existing export trade already was,\r\nowing to the taxes and emigration of native labour, due to “the means\r\nemployed in raising native levies,” the petitioners went on to say:\r\n“We do not disguise from ourselves that business in the Lower Congo is\r\npractically _nil_.... Each of us,” continues the petition, “consistently\r\nhopes for an increase in trade; but these hopes appear to us more and\r\nmore unreliable, and the Government of the Congo State, instead of coming\r\nto aid us, imposes increased and too onerous taxes.”\r\n\r\n[280] The figures for 1900 are based upon the known sale on the Antwerp\r\nmarket by the State brokers in 1900 of 1828 tons of rubber and 153,445\r\nkilos. of ivory, worked out at an average of 6 francs per kilo. for\r\nrubber (1115 kilos, to the ton) and 18 francs per kilo, for ivory. I\r\nbelieve a proportion of the produce imported was held in stock on account\r\nof the poor state of the rubber market.\r\n\r\n[281] “There is no trade, properly so called,” says Mr. Codrington, “on\r\nthe Congo coast of Tanganyika, but all rubber and ivory is regarded as\r\nthe property of the State, and has to be surrendered by the natives in\r\nfixed quantities annually. The natives are, however, continually in\r\nrebellion, and the country is unsafe, except in the immediate vicinity\r\nof the military garrisons, and within the sphere of influence of the\r\nmissionaries.”\r\n\r\n[282] As was anticipated, the acquirement from Spain for purposes of\r\nexploitation of a portion of the Muni territory (which was recently\r\nhanded over to Spain by France) by the Belgian “clique” has been followed\r\nby the usual results. A correspondent, whose name commands universal\r\nrespect, and who is in a position to speak _de visu_ on the subject,\r\nwrote to an English friend recently that “atrocities” were going merrily\r\non; natives being shot down, and villages burnt in the course of “ivory\r\ncollecting” by the Belgian concessionnaires; “outrages on the villagers\r\nare indiscriminate,” the writer adds. The same “clique” is threatening\r\nFernando Po.\r\n\r\n[283] Apart from the large quantities of rifles, cap-guns, and\r\nammunition imported into the Congo State for the arming and equipment\r\nof the soldiers, regular and irregular, it is morally certain, although\r\nnot easy to prove, that the agents of the State and the agents of\r\nthe _Domaine Privé_ Companies encourage some of the biggest and\r\nmost powerful chiefs of the Upper Congo to obtain ivory for them by\r\npresents of repeating-rifles and ammunition. In this connection a M.\r\nLéon. C. Berthier, writing from the French Upper Congo to the Paris\r\norgan _La Dépêche Coloniale_ (issue July 16, 1902), says: “The M’Bomu\r\n(a branch of the Upper Ubanghi, which forms the frontier between the\r\nFrench and Congolese possessions, and which pursues its course to the\r\nBahr-el-Ghazal), here very wide, forms the southern base of the square;\r\nthis is the route where the ivory passes _sous notre barbe_ to be sold\r\nto the Belgians on the other bank, _who pay for it in Albini rifles_,\r\nnotwithstanding all the Acts of Berlin and Brussels, which forbid even\r\nthe sale of percussion-cap guns!” The writer goes on to assert that he\r\nhas documents to prove his statements.\r\n\r\n[284] Mary Kingsley, in the “Story of West Africa.”\r\n\r\n[285] Excluding specie.
