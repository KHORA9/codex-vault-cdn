RICHARDSON\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Tyler\r\n\r\nApril 4, 1841, to March 4, 1845\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Tyler\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER, second son of Judge John Tyler, governor of Virginia from\r\n1808 to 1811, and Mary Armistead, was born at Greenway, Charles City\r\nCounty, Va., March 29, 1790. He was graduated at William and Mary\r\nCollege in 1807. At college he showed a strong interest in ancient\r\nhistory; was also fond of poetry and music, and was a skillful performer\r\non the violin. In 1809 he was admitted to the bar, and had already begun\r\nto obtain a good practice when he was elected to the legislature. Took\r\nhis seat in that body in December, 1811. Was here a firm supporter of\r\nMr. Madison's Administration; and the war with Great Britain, which\r\nsoon followed, afforded him an opportunity to become conspicuous as\r\na forcible and persuasive orator. March 29, 1813, he married Letitia,\r\ndaughter of Robert Christian, and a few weeks afterwards was called\r\ninto the field at the head of a company of militia to take part in the\r\ndefense of Richmond, threatened by the British. This military service\r\nlasted but a month. He was reelected to the legislature annually until,\r\nin November, 1816, he was chosen to fill a vacancy in the United States\r\nHouse of Representatives. Was reelected to the Fifteenth and Sixteenth\r\nCongresses. In 1821, his health being seriously impaired, he declined\r\na reelection and retired to private life. In 1823 he was again elected\r\nto the Virginia legislature. Here he was a friend to the candidacy of\r\nWilliam H. Crawford for the Presidency. In 1824 he was a candidate to\r\nfill a vacancy in the United States Senate, but was defeated. He opposed\r\nin 1825 the attempt to remove William and Mary College to Richmond, and\r\nwas afterwards made successively rector and chancellor of the college,\r\nwhich prospered signally under his management. In December, 1825, he was\r\nchosen by the legislature to the governorship of Virginia, and in the\r\nfollowing year was reelected by a unanimous vote. In December, 1826, the\r\nfriends of Clay and Adams combined with the Democrats opposed to John\r\nRandolph and elected Mr. Tyler to the United States Senate. In February,\r\n1830, after taking part in the Virginia convention for revising the\r\nState constitution, he returned to his seat in the Senate, and found\r\nhimself first drawn toward Jackson by the veto message (May 27) upon the\r\nMaysville turnpike bill; supported Jackson in the Presidential election\r\nof 1832, but broke with the Administration on the question of the\r\nremoval of the deposits from the United States Bank, and voted for Mr.\r\nClay's resolution to censure the President. He was nominated by the\r\nState-rights Whigs for Vice-President in 1835, and at the election on\r\nNovember 8, 1836, received 47 electoral votes; but no candidate having\r\na majority of electoral votes, the Senate elected Richard M. Johnson,\r\nof Kentucky. The legislature of Virginia having instructed the Senators\r\nfrom that State to vote for expunging the resolutions of censure upon\r\nPresident Jackson, Mr. Tyler refused to obey the instructions, resigned\r\nhis seat, and returned home February 29, 1836. On January 10, 1838,\r\nhe was chosen president of the Virginia Colonization Society. In the\r\nspring of 1838 he was returned to the Virginia legislature. In January,\r\n1839, he was a candidate for reelection to the United States Senate;\r\nthe result was a deadlock, and the question was indefinitely postponed\r\nbefore any choice had been made. December 4, 1839, the Whig national\r\nconvention, at Harrisburg, Pa., nominated him for Vice-President on the\r\nticket with William Henry Harrison, and at the election on November 10,\r\n1840, he was elected, receiving 234 electoral votes to 48 for Richard M.\r\nJohnson, of Kentucky. By the death of President Harrison April 4, 1841,\r\nMr. Tyler became President of the United States. He took the oath of\r\noffice on April 6. Among the more important events of his Administration\r\nwere the \"Ashburton treaty\" with Great Britain, the termination of\r\nthe Indian war in Florida, the passage of the resolutions by Congress\r\nproviding for the annexation of Texas, and the treaty with China. On May\r\n27, 1844, he was nominated for President at a convention in Baltimore,\r\nbut although at first he accepted the nomination, he subsequently\r\nwithdrew his name. On June 26, 1844, Mr. Tyler married Miss Julia\r\nGardiner, of New York, his first wife having died September 9, 1842.\r\nAfter leaving the White House he took up his residence on his estate,\r\nSherwood Forest, near Greenway, Va., on the bank of the James River. Was\r\npresident of the Peace Convention held at Washington February 4, 1861.\r\nAfterwards, as a delegate to the Virginia State convention, he advocated\r\nthe passage of an ordinance of secession. In May, 1861, he was\r\nunanimously elected a member of the provisional congress of the\r\nConfederate States. In the following autumn he was elected to the\r\npermanent congress, but died at Richmond January 18, 1862, before\r\ntaking his seat, and was buried in Hollywood Cemetery, in that city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 9, 1841_.\r\n\r\n_To the People of the United States_.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS: Before my arrival at the seat of Government the painful\r\ncommunication was made to you by the officers presiding over the several\r\nDepartments of the deeply regretted death of William Henry Harrison,\r\nlate President of the United States. Upon him you had conferred your\r\nsuffrages for the first office in your gift, and had selected him as\r\nyour chosen instrument to correct and reform all such errors and abuses\r\nas had manifested themselves from time to time in the practical\r\noperation of the Government. While standing at the threshold of this\r\ngreat work he has by the dispensation of an all-wise Providence been\r\nremoved from amongst us, and by the provisions of the Constitution the\r\nefforts to be directed to the accomplishing of this vitally important\r\ntask have devolved upon myself. This same occurrence has subjected the\r\nwisdom and sufficiency of our institutions to a new test. For the first\r\ntime in our history the person elected to the Vice-Presidency of the\r\nUnited States, by the happening of a contingency provided for in the\r\nConstitution, has had devolved upon him the Presidential office.\r\nThe spirit of faction, which is directly opposed to the spirit of\r\na lofty patriotism, may find in this occasion for assaults upon my\r\nAdministration; and in succeeding, under circumstances so sudden\r\nand unexpected and to responsibilities so greatly augmented, to the\r\nadministration of public affairs I shall place in the intelligence and\r\npatriotism of the people my only sure reliance. My earnest prayer shall\r\nbe constantly addressed to the all-wise and all-powerful Being who\r\nmade me, and by whose dispensation I am called to the high office\r\nof President of this Confederacy, understandingly to carry out the\r\nprinciples of that Constitution which I have sworn \"to protect,\r\npreserve, and defend.\"\r\n\r\nThe usual opportunity which is afforded to a Chief Magistrate upon his\r\ninduction to office of presenting to his countrymen an exposition of the\r\npolicy which would guide his Administration, in the form of an inaugural\r\naddress, not having, under the peculiar circumstances which have brought\r\nme to the discharge of the high duties of President of the United\r\nStates, been afforded to me, a brief exposition of the principles which\r\nwill govern me in the general course of my administration of public\r\naffairs would seem to be due as well to myself as to you.\r\n\r\nIn regard to foreign nations, the groundwork of my policy will be\r\njustice on our part to all, submitting to injustice from none. While\r\nI shall sedulously cultivate the relations of peace and amity with one\r\nand all, it will be my most imperative duty to see that the honor of the\r\ncountry shall sustain no blemish. With a view to this, the condition of\r\nour military defenses will become a matter of anxious solicitude. The\r\nArmy, which has in other days covered itself with renown, and the Navy,\r\nnot inappropriately termed the right arm of the public defense, which\r\nhas spread a light of glory over the American standard in all the waters\r\nof the earth, should be rendered replete with efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact, well avouched by history, that the tendency of all\r\nhuman institutions is to concentrate power in the hands of a single man,\r\nand that their ultimate downfall has proceeded from this cause, I deem\r\nit of the most essential importance that a complete separation should\r\ntake place between the sword and the purse. No matter where or how the\r\npublic moneys shall be deposited, so long as the President can exert the\r\npower of appointing and removing at his pleasure the agents selected for\r\ntheir custody the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy is in fact the\r\ntreasurer. A permanent and radical change should therefore be decreed.\r\nThe patronage incident to the Presidential office, already great, is\r\nconstantly increasing. Such increase is destined to keep pace with the\r\ngrowth of our population, until, without a figure of speech, an army\r\nof officeholders may be spread over the land. The unrestrained power\r\nexerted by a selfishly ambitious man in order either to perpetuate his\r\nauthority or to hand it over to some favorite as his successor may lead\r\nto the employment of all the means within his control to accomplish his\r\nobject. The right to remove from office, while subjected to no just\r\nrestraint, is inevitably destined to produce a spirit of crouching\r\nservility with the official corps, which, in order to uphold the hand\r\nwhich feeds them, would lead to direct and active interference in the\r\nelections, both State and Federal, thereby subjecting the course of\r\nState legislation to the dictation of the chief executive officer and\r\nmaking the will of that officer absolute and supreme. I will at a proper\r\ntime invoke the action of Congress upon this subject, and shall readily\r\nacquiesce in the adoption of all proper measures which are calculated to\r\narrest these evils, so full of danger in their tendency. I will remove\r\nno incumbent from office who has faithfully and honestly acquitted\r\nhimself of the duties of his office, except in such cases where\r\nsuch officer has been guilty of an active partisanship or by secret\r\nmeans--the less manly, and therefore the more objectionable--has given\r\nhis official influence to the purposes of party, thereby bringing the\r\npatronage of the Government in conflict with the freedom of elections.\r\nNumerous removals may become necessary under this rule. These will\r\nbe made by me through no acerbity of feeling--I have had no cause to\r\ncherish or indulge unkind feelings toward any--but my conduct will be\r\nregulated by a profound sense of what is due to the country and its\r\ninstitutions; nor shall I neglect to apply the same unbending rule\r\nto those of my own appointment. Freedom of opinion will be tolerated,\r\nthe full enjoyment of the right of suffrage will be maintained as the\r\nbirthright of every American citizen; but I say emphatically to the\r\nofficial corps, \"Thus far and no farther.\" I have dwelt the longer upon\r\nthis subject because removals from office are likely often to arise,\r\nand I would have my countrymen to understand the principle of the\r\nExecutive action.\r\n\r\nIn all public expenditures the most rigid economy should be resorted to,\r\nand, as one of its results, a public debt in time of peace be sedulously\r\navoided. A wise and patriotic constituency will never object to the\r\nimposition of necessary burdens for useful ends, and true wisdom\r\ndictates the resort to such means in order to supply deficiencies in the\r\nrevenue, rather than to those doubtful expedients which, ultimating in\r\na public debt, serve to embarrass the resources of the country and to\r\nlessen its ability to meet any great emergency which may arise. All\r\nsinecures should be abolished. The appropriations should be direct\r\nand explicit, so as to leave as limited a share of discretion to the\r\ndisbursing agents as may be found compatible with the public service.\r\nA strict responsibility on the part of all the agents of the Government\r\nshould be maintained and peculation or defalcation visited with\r\nimmediate expulsion from office and the most condign punishment.\r\n\r\nThe public interest also demands that if any war has existed between\r\nthe Government and the currency it shall cease. Measures of a financial\r\ncharacter now having the sanction of legal enactment shall be faithfully\r\nenforced until repealed by the legislative authority. But I owe it to\r\nmyself to declare that I regard existing enactments as unwise and\r\nimpolitic and in a high degree oppressive. I shall promptly give my\r\nsanction to any constitutional measure which, originating in Congress,\r\nshall have for its object the restoration of a sound circulating medium,\r\nso essentially necessary to give confidence in all the transactions\r\nof life, to secure to industry its just and adequate rewards, and to\r\nreestablish the public prosperity. In deciding upon the adaptation of\r\nany such measure to the end proposed, as well as its conformity to the\r\nConstitution, I shall resort to the fathers of the great republican\r\nschool for advice and instruction, to be drawn from their sage views of\r\nour system of government and the light of their ever-glorious example.\r\n\r\nThe institutions under which we live, my countrymen, secure each person\r\nin the perfect enjoyment of all his rights. The spectacle is exhibited\r\nto the world of a government deriving its powers from the consent of the\r\ngoverned and having imparted to it only so much power as is necessary\r\nfor its successful operation. Those who are charged with its\r\nadministration should carefully abstain from all attempts to enlarge\r\nthe range of powers thus granted to the several departments of the\r\nGovernment other than by an appeal to the people for additional grants,\r\nlest by so doing they disturb that balance which the patriots and\r\nstatesmen who framed the Constitution designed to establish between the\r\nFederal Government and the States composing the Union. The observance\r\nof these rules is enjoined upon us by that feeling of reverence and\r\naffection which finds a place in the heart of every patriot for the\r\npreservation of union and the blessings of union--for the good of our\r\nchildren and our children's children through countless generations.\r\nAn opposite course could not fail to generate factions intent upon\r\nthe gratification of their selfish ends, to give birth to local and\r\nsectional jealousies, and to ultimate either in breaking asunder the\r\nbonds of union or in building up a central system which would inevitably\r\nend in a bloody scepter and an iron crown.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I beg you to be assured that I shall exert myself to carry\r\nthe foregoing principles into practice during my administration of the\r\nGovernment, and, confiding in the protecting care of an everwatchful and\r\noverruling Providence, it shall be my first and highest duty to preserve\r\nunimpaired the free institutions under which we live and transmit them\r\nto those who shall succeed me in their full force and vigor.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[For proclamation of President Tyler recommending, in consequence of the\r\ndeath of President Harrison, a day of fasting and prayer, see p. 32.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL SESSION MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 1, 1841_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_.\r\n\r\nFELLOW CITIZENS: You have been assembled in your respective halls of\r\nlegislation under a proclamation bearing the signature of the\r\nillustrious citizen who was so lately called by the direct suffrages of\r\nthe people to the discharge of the important functions of their chief\r\nexecutive office. Upon the expiration of a single month from the day of\r\nhis installation he has paid the great debt of nature, leaving behind\r\nhim a name associated with the recollection of numerous benefits\r\nconferred upon the country during a long life of patriotic devotion.\r\nWith this public bereavement are connected other considerations which\r\nwill not escape the attention of Congress. The preparations necessary\r\nfor his removal to the seat of Government in view of a residence of four\r\nyears must have devolved upon the late President heavy expenditures,\r\nwhich, if permitted to burthen the limited resources of his private\r\nfortune, may tend seriously to the embarrassment of his surviving\r\nfamily; and it is therefore respectfully submitted to Congress whether\r\nthe ordinary principles of justice would not dictate the propriety of\r\nits legislative interposition. By the provisions of the fundamental law\r\nthe powers and duties of the high station to which he was elected have\r\ndevolved upon me, and in the dispositions of the representatives of the\r\nStates and of the people will be found, to a great extent, a solution of\r\nthe problem to which our institutions are for the first time subjected.\r\n\r\nIn entering upon the duties of this office I did not feel that it would\r\nbe becoming in me to disturb what had been ordered by my lamented\r\npredecessor. Whatever, therefore, may have been my opinion originally as\r\nto the propriety of convening Congress at so early a day from that of\r\nits late adjournment, I found a new and controlling inducement not to\r\ninterfere with the patriotic desires of the late President in the\r\nnovelty of the situation in which I was so unexpectedly placed. My first\r\nwish under such circumstances would necessarily have been to have called\r\nto my aid in the administration of public affairs the combined wisdom of\r\nthe two Houses of Congress, in order to take their counsel and advice as\r\nto the best mode of extricating the Government and the country from the\r\nembarrassments weighing heavily on both. I am, then, most happy in\r\nfinding myself so soon after my accession to the Presidency surrounded\r\nby the immediate representatives of the States and people.\r\n\r\nNo important changes having taken place in our foreign relations since\r\nthe last session of Congress, it is not deemed necessary on this\r\noccasion to go into a detailed statement in regard to them. I am happy\r\nto say that I see nothing to destroy the hope of being able to preserve\r\npeace, The ratification of the treaty with Portugal has been duly\r\nexchanged between the two Governments. This Government has not been\r\ninattentive to the interests of those of our citizens who have claims on\r\nthe Government of Spain founded on express treaty stipulations, and a\r\nhope is indulged that the representations which have been made to that\r\nGovernment on this subject may lead ere long to beneficial results.\r\n\r\nA correspondence has taken place between the Secretary of State and the\r\nminister of Her Britannic Majesty accredited to this Government on the\r\nsubject of Alexander McLeod's indictment and imprisonment, copies of\r\nwhich are herewith communicated to Congress.\r\n\r\nIn addition to what appears from these papers, it may be proper to state\r\nthat Alexander McLeod has been heard by the supreme court of the State\r\nof New York on his motion to be discharged from imprisonment, and that\r\nthe decision of that court has not as yet been pronounced.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State has addressed to me a paper upon two subjects\r\ninteresting to the commerce of the country, which will receive my\r\nconsideration, and which I have the honor to communicate to Congress.\r\n\r\nSo far as it depends on the course of this Government, our relations of\r\ngood will and friendship will be sedulously cultivated with all nations.\r\nThe true American policy will be found to consist in the exercise of\r\na spirit of justice, to be manifested in the discharge of all our\r\ninternational obligations to the weakest of the family of nations as\r\nwell as to the most powerful. Occasional conflicts of opinion may arise,\r\nbut when the discussions incident to them are conducted in the language\r\nof truth and with a strict regard to justice the scourge of war will for\r\nthe most part be avoided. The time ought to be regarded as having gone\r\nby when a resort to arms is to be esteemed as the only proper arbiter\r\nof national differences.\r\n\r\nThe census recently taken shows a regularly progressive increase in\r\nour population. Upon the breaking out of the War of the Revolution\r\nour numbers scarcely equaled 3,000,000 souls; they already exceed\r\n17,000,000, and will continue to progress in a ratio which duplicates in\r\na period of about twenty-three years. The old States contain a territory\r\nsufficient in itself to maintain a population of additional millions,\r\nand the most populous of the new States may even yet be regarded as but\r\npartially settled, while of the new lands on this side of the Rocky\r\nMountains, to say nothing of the immense region which stretches from\r\nthe base of those mountains to the mouth of the Columbia River, about\r\n770,000,000 acres, ceded and unceded, still remain to be brought into\r\nmarket. We hold out to the people of other countries an invitation to\r\ncome and settle among us as members of our rapidly growing family, and\r\nfor the blessings which we offer them we require of them to look upon\r\nour country as their country and to unite with us in the great task of\r\npreserving our institutions and thereby perpetuating our liberties. No\r\nmotive exists for foreign conquest; we desire but to reclaim our almost\r\nillimitable wildernesses and to introduce into their depths the lights\r\nof civilization. While we shall at all times be prepared to vindicate\r\nthe national honor, our most earnest desire will be to maintain an\r\nunbroken peace.\r\n\r\nIn presenting the foregoing views I can not withhold the expression of\r\nthe opinion that there exists nothing in the extension of our Empire\r\nover our acknowledged possessions to excite the alarm of the patriot for\r\nthe safety of our institutions. The federative system, leaving to each\r\nState the care of its domestic concerns and devolving on the Federal\r\nGovernment those of general import, admits in safety of the greatest\r\nexpansion; but at the same time I deem it proper to add that there will\r\nbe found to exist at all times an imperious necessity for restraining\r\nall the functionaries of this Government within the range of their\r\nrespective powers, thereby preserving a just balance between the powers\r\ngranted to this Government and those reserved to the States and to the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nFrom the report of the Secretary of the Treasury you will perceive that\r\nthe fiscal means, present and accruing, are insufficient to supply the\r\nwants of the Government for the current year. The balance in the\r\nTreasury on the 4th day of March last not covered by outstanding drafts,\r\nand exclusive of trust funds, is estimated at $860,000. This includes\r\nthe sum of $215,000 deposited in the Mint and its branches to procure\r\nmetal for coining and in process of coinage, and which could not be\r\nwithdrawn without inconvenience, thus leaving subject to draft in the\r\nvarious depositories the sum of $645,000. By virtue of two several acts\r\nof Congress the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to issue on and\r\nafter the 4th day of March last Treasury notes to the amount of\r\n$5,413,000, making an aggregate available fund of $6,058,000 on hand.\r\n\r\nBut this fund was chargeable, with outstanding Treasury notes redeemable\r\nin the current year and interest thereon, to the estimated amount of\r\n$5,280,000. There is also thrown upon the Treasury the payment of a\r\nlarge amount of demands accrued in whole or in part in former years,\r\nwhich will exhaust the available means of the Treasury and leave the\r\naccruing revenue, reduced as it is in amount, burthened with debt and\r\ncharged with the current expenses of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate amount of outstanding appropriations on the 4th day of\r\nMarch last was $33,429,616.50, of which $24,210,000 will be required\r\nduring the current year; and there will also be required for the\r\nuse of the War Department additional appropriations to the amount of\r\n$2,511,132.98, the special objects of which will be seen by reference\r\nto the report of the Secretary of War. The anticipated means of the\r\nTreasury are greatly inadequate to this demand. The receipts from\r\ncustoms for the last three quarters of the last year and first quarter\r\nof the present year amounted to $12,100,000; the receipts for lands\r\nfor the same time to $2,742,450, shewing an average revenue from both\r\nsources of $1,236,870 per month.\r\n\r\nA gradual expansion of trade, growing out of a restoration of\r\nconfidence, together with a reduction in the expenses of collecting and\r\npunctuality on the part of collecting officers, may cause an addition\r\nto the monthly receipts from the customs. They are estimated for the\r\nresidue of the year from the 4th of March at $12,000,000. The receipts\r\nfrom the public lands for the same time are estimated at $2,500,000, and\r\nfrom miscellaneous sources at $170,000, making an aggregate of available\r\nfund within the year of $15,315,000, which will leave a probable deficit\r\nof $11,406,132.98. To meet this some temporary provision is necessary\r\nuntil the amount can be absorbed by the excess of revenues which are\r\nanticipated to accrue at no distant day.\r\n\r\nThere will fall due within the next three months Treasury notes of\r\nthe issues of 1840, including interest, about $2,850,000. There is\r\nchargeable in the same period for arrearages for taking the Sixth Census\r\n$294,000, and the estimated expenditures for the current service are\r\nabout $8,100,000, making the aggregate demand upon the Treasury prior\r\nto the 1st of September next about $11,340,000.\r\n\r\nThe ways and means in the Treasury and estimated to accrue within the\r\nabove-named period consist of about $694,000 of funds available on the\r\n28th ultimo, an unissued balance of Treasury notes authorized by the act\r\nof 1841 amounting to $1,955,000, and estimated receipts from all sources\r\nof $3,800,000, making an aggregate of about $6,450,000, and leaving a\r\nprobable deficit on the 1st of September next of $4,845,000.\r\n\r\nIn order to supply the wants of the Government, an intelligent\r\nconstituency, in view of their best interests, will without hesitation\r\nsubmit to all necessary burthens. But it is nevertheless important so to\r\nimpose them as to avoid defeating the just expectations of the country\r\ngrowing out of preexisting laws. The act of the 2d of March, 1833,\r\ncommonly called the \"compromise act,\" should not be altered except under\r\nurgent necessities, which are not believed at this time to exist. One\r\nyear only remains to complete the series of reductions provided for by\r\nthat law, at which time provisions made by the same law, and which then\r\nwill be brought actively in aid of the manufacturing interests of the\r\nUnion, will not fail to produce the most beneficial results. Under a\r\nsystem of discriminating duties imposed for purposes of revenue, in\r\nunison with the provisions of existing laws, it is to be hoped that our\r\npolicy will in the future be fixed and permanent, so as to avoid those\r\nconstant fluctuations which defeat the very objects they have in view.\r\nWe shall thus best maintain a position which, while it will enable us\r\nthe more readily to meet the advances of other countries calculated to\r\npromote our trade and commerce, will at the same time leave in our own\r\nhands the means of retaliating with greater effect unjust regulations.\r\n\r\nIn intimate connection with the question of revenue is that which makes\r\nprovision for a suitable fiscal agent, capable of adding increased\r\nfacilities in the collection and disbursement of the public revenues,\r\nrendering more secure their custody, and consulting a true economy\r\nin the great, multiplied, and delicate operations of the Treasury\r\nDepartment. Upon such an agent depends in an eminent degree the\r\nestablishment of a currency of uniform value, which is of so great\r\nimportance to all the essential interests of society, and on the wisdom\r\nto be manifested in its creation much depends. So intimately interwoven\r\nare its operations, not only with the interests of individuals, but of\r\nStates, that it may be regarded to a great degree as controlling both.\r\nIf paper be used as the chief medium of circulation, and the power be\r\nvested in the Government of issuing it at pleasure, either in the form\r\nof Treasury drafts or any other, or if banks be used as the public\r\ndepositories, with liberty to regard all surpluses from day to day as\r\nso much added to their active capital, prices are exposed to constant\r\nfluctuations and industry to severe suffering. In the one case political\r\nconsiderations directed to party purposes may control, while excessive\r\ncupidity may prevail in the other. The public is thus constantly liable\r\nto imposition. Expansions and contractions may follow each other in\r\nrapid succession--the one engendering a reckless spirit of adventure and\r\nspeculation, which embraces States as well as individuals, the other\r\ncausing a fall in prices and accomplishing an entire change in the\r\naspect of affairs. Stocks of all sorts rapidly decline, individuals\r\nare ruined, and States embarrassed even in their efforts to meet with\r\npunctuality the interest on their debts. Such, unhappily, is the\r\ncondition of things now existing in the United States. These effects may\r\nreadily be traced to the causes above referred to. The public revenues,\r\nbeing removed from the then Bank of the United States, under an order of\r\na late President, were placed in selected State banks, which, actuated\r\nby the double motive of conciliating the Government and augmenting their\r\nprofits to the greatest possible extent, enlarged extravagantly their\r\ndiscounts, thus enabling all other existing banks to do the same; large\r\ndividends were declared, which, stimulating the cupidity of capitalists,\r\ncaused a rush to be made to the legislatures of the respective States\r\nfor similar acts of incorporation, which by many of the States, under a\r\ntemporary infatuation, were readily granted, and thus the augmentation\r\nof the circulating medium, consisting almost exclusively of paper,\r\nproduced a most fatal delusion. An illustration derived from the land\r\nsales of the period alluded to will serve best to show the effect of the\r\nwhole system. The average sales of the public lands for a period of ten\r\nyears prior to 1834 had not much exceeded $2,000,000 per annum. In 1834\r\nthey attained in round numbers to the amount of $6,000,000; in the\r\nsucceeding year of 1835 they reached $16,000,000, and the next year of\r\n1836 they amounted to the enormous sum of $25,000,000, thus crowding\r\ninto the short space of three years upward of twenty-three years'\r\npurchase of the public domain. So apparent had become the necessity of\r\narresting this course of things that the executive department assumed\r\nthe highly questionable power of discriminating in the funds to be used\r\nin payment by different classes of public debtors--a discrimination\r\nwhich was doubtless designed to correct this most ruinous state of\r\nthings by the exaction of specie in all payments for the public lands,\r\nbut which could not at once arrest the tide which had so strongly set\r\nin. Hence the demands for specie became unceasing, and corresponding\r\nprostration rapidly ensued under the necessities created with the banks\r\nto curtail their discounts and thereby to reduce their circulation.\r\nI recur to these things with no disposition to censure preexisting\r\nAdministrations of the Government, but simply in exemplification of the\r\ntruth of the position which I have assumed. If, then, any fiscal agent\r\nwhich may be created shall be placed, without due restrictions, either\r\nin the hands of the administrators of the Government or those of private\r\nindividuals, the temptation to abuse will prove to be resistless.\r\nObjects of political aggrandizement may seduce the first, and the\r\npromptings of a boundless cupidity will assail the last. Aided by the\r\nexperience of the past, it will be the pleasure of Congress so to guard\r\nand fortify the public interests in the creation of any new agent as to\r\nplace them, so far as human wisdom can accomplish it, on a footing of\r\nperfect security. Within a few years past three different schemes have\r\nbeen before the country. The charter of the Bank of the United States\r\nexpired by its own limitations in 1836. An effort was made to renew\r\nit, which received the sanction of the two Houses of Congress, but the\r\nthen President of the United States exercised his _veto_ power and the\r\nmeasure was defeated. A regard to truth requires me to say that the\r\nPresident was fully sustained in the course he had taken by the popular\r\nvoice. His successor to the chair of state unqualifiedly pronounced his\r\nopposition to any new charter of a similar institution, and not only the\r\npopular election which brought him into power, but the elections through\r\nmuch of his term, seemed clearly to indicate a concurrence with him\r\nin sentiment on the part of the people. After the public moneys were\r\nwithdrawn from the United States Bank they were placed in deposit with\r\nthe State banks, and the result of that policy has been before the\r\ncountry. To say nothing as to the question whether that experiment\r\nwas made under propitious or adverse circumstances, it may safely be\r\nasserted that it did receive the unqualified condemnation of most of its\r\nearly advocates, and, it is believed, was also condemned by the popular\r\nsentiment. The existing subtreasury system does not seem to stand in\r\nhigher favor with the people, but has recently been condemned in a\r\nmanner too plainly indicated to admit of a doubt. Thus in the short\r\nperiod of eight years the popular voice may be regarded as having\r\nsuccessively condemned each of the three schemes of finance to which\r\nI have adverted. As to the first, it was introduced at a time (1816)\r\nwhen the State banks, then comparatively few in number, had been forced\r\nto suspend specie payments by reason of the war which had previously\r\nprevailed with Great Britain. Whether if the United States Bank charter,\r\nwhich expired in 1811, had been renewed in due season it would have been\r\nenabled to continue specie payments during the war and the disastrous\r\nperiod to the commerce of the country which immediately succeeded is, to\r\nsay the least, problematical, and whether the United States Bank of 1816\r\nproduced a restoration of specie payments or the same was accomplished\r\nthrough the instrumentality of other means was a matter of some\r\ndifficulty at that time to determine. Certain it is that for the first\r\nyears of the operation of that bank its course was as disastrous as\r\nfor the greater part of its subsequent career it became eminently\r\nsuccessful. As to the second, the experiment was tried with a redundant\r\nTreasury, which continued to increase until it seemed to be the part\r\nof wisdom to distribute the surplus revenue among the States, which,\r\noperating at the same time with the specie circular and the causes\r\nbefore adverted to, caused them to suspend specie payments and involved\r\nthe country in the greatest embarrassment. And as to the third, if\r\ncarried through all the stages of its transmutation from paper and\r\nspecie to nothing but the precious metals, to say nothing of the\r\ninsecurity of the public moneys, its injurious effects have been\r\nanticipated by the country in its unqualified condemnation. What is now\r\nto be regarded as the judgment of the American people on this whole\r\nsubject I have no accurate means of determining but by appealing to\r\ntheir more immediate representatives. The late contest, which terminated\r\nin the election of General Harrison to the Presidency, was decided on\r\nprinciples well known and openly declared, and while the subtreasury\r\nreceived in the result the most decided condemnation, yet no other\r\nscheme of finance seemed to have been concurred in. To you, then, who\r\nhave come more directly from the body of our common constituents, I\r\nsubmit the entire question, as best qualified to give a full exposition\r\nof their wishes and opinions. I shall be ready to concur with you in the\r\nadoption of such system as you may propose, reserving to myself the\r\nultimate power of rejecting any measure which may, in my view of it,\r\nconflict with the Constitution or otherwise jeopardize the prosperity of\r\nthe country--a power which I could not part with even if I would, but\r\nwhich I will not believe any act of yours will call into requisition.\r\n\r\nI can not avoid recurring, in connection with this subject, to the\r\nnecessity which exists for adopting some suitable measure whereby the\r\nunlimited creation of banks by the States may be corrected in future.\r\nSuch result can be most readily achieved by the consent of the States,\r\nto be expressed in the form of a compact among themselves, which\r\nthey can only enter into with the consent and approbation of this\r\nGovernment--a consent which might in the present emergency of the\r\npublic demands justifiably be given by Congress in advance of any action\r\nby the States, as an inducement to such action, upon terms well defined\r\nby the act of tender. Such a measure, addressing itself to the calm\r\nreflection of the States, would find in the experience of the past and\r\nthe condition of the present much to sustain it; and it is greatly to be\r\ndoubted whether any scheme of finance can prove for any length of time\r\nsuccessful while the States shall continue in the unrestrained exercise\r\nof the power of creating banking corporations. This power can only be\r\nlimited by their consent.\r\n\r\nWith the adoption of a financial agency of a satisfactory character the\r\nhope may be indulged that the country may once more return to a state of\r\nprosperity. Measures auxiliary thereto, and in some measure inseparably\r\nconnected with its success, will doubtless claim the attention of\r\nCongress. Among such, a distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the\r\npublic lands, provided such distribution does not force upon Congress\r\nthe necessity of imposing upon commerce heavier burthens than those\r\ncontemplated by the act of 1833, would act as an efficient remedial\r\nmeasure by being brought directly in aid of the States. As one sincerely\r\ndevoted to the task of preserving a just balance in our system of\r\nGovernment by the maintenance of the States in a condition the most free\r\nand respectable and in the full possession of all their power, I can no\r\notherwise than feel desirous for their emancipation from the situation\r\nto which the pressure on their finances now subjects them. And while I\r\nmust repudiate, as a measure founded in error and wanting constitutional\r\nsanction, the slightest approach to an assumption by this Government of\r\nthe debts of the States, yet I can see in the distribution adverted to\r\nmuch to recommend it. The compacts between the proprietor States and\r\nthis Government expressly guarantee to the States all the benefits which\r\nmay arise from the sales. The mode by which this is to be effected\r\naddresses itself to the discretion of Congress as the trustee for the\r\nStates, and its exercise after the most beneficial manner is restrained\r\nby nothing in the grants or in the Constitution so long as Congress\r\nshall consult that equality in the distribution which the compacts\r\nrequire. In the present condition of some of the States the question of\r\ndistribution may be regarded as substantially a question between direct\r\nand indirect taxation. If the distribution be not made in some form\r\nor other, the necessity will daily become more urgent with the debtor\r\nStates for a resort to an oppressive system of direct taxation, or their\r\ncredit, and necessarily their power and influence, will be greatly\r\ndiminished. The payment of taxes after the most inconvenient and\r\noppressive mode will be exacted in place of contributions for the most\r\npart voluntarily made, and therefore comparatively unoppressive. The\r\nStates are emphatically the constituents of this Government, and we\r\nshould be entirely regardless of the objects held in view by them in\r\nthe creation of this Government if we could be indifferent to their\r\ngood. The happy effects of such a measure upon all the States would\r\nimmediately be manifested. With the debtor States it would effect the\r\nrelief to a great extent of the citizens from a heavy burthen of direct\r\ntaxation, which presses with severity on the laboring classes, and\r\neminently assist in restoring the general prosperity. An immediate\r\nadvance would take place in the price of the State securities, and the\r\nattitude of the States would become once more, as it should ever be,\r\nlofty and erect. With States laboring under no extreme pressure from\r\ndebt, the fund which they would derive from this source would enable\r\nthem to improve their condition in an eminent degree. So far as this\r\nGovernment is concerned, appropriations to domestic objects approaching\r\nin amount the revenue derived from the land sales might be abandoned,\r\nand thus a system of unequal, and therefore unjust, legislation would\r\nbe substituted by one dispensing equality to all the members of this\r\nConfederacy. Whether such distribution should be made directly to the\r\nStates in the proceeds of the sales or in the form of profits by virtue\r\nof the operations of any fiscal agency having those proceeds as its\r\nbasis, should such measure be contemplated by Congress, would well\r\ndeserve its consideration. Nor would such disposition of the proceeds of\r\nthe sales in any manner prevent Congress from time to time from passing\r\nall necessary preemption laws for the benefit of actual settlers, or\r\nfrom making any new arrangement as to the price of the public lands\r\nwhich might in future be esteemed desirable.\r\n\r\nI beg leave particularly to call your attention to the accompanying\r\nreport from the Secretary of War. Besides the present state of the war\r\nwhich has so long afflicted the Territory of Florida, and the various\r\nother matters of interest therein referred to, you will learn from it\r\nthat the Secretary has instituted an inquiry into abuses, which promises\r\nto develop gross enormities in connection with Indian treaties which\r\nhave been negotiated, as well as in the expenditures for the removal and\r\nsubsistence of the Indians. He represents also other irregularities\r\nof a serious nature that have grown up in the practice of the Indian\r\nDepartment, which will require the appropriation of upward of $200,000\r\nto correct, and which claim the immediate attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn reflecting on the proper means of defending the country we can not\r\nshut our eyes to the consequences which the introduction and use of the\r\npower of steam upon the ocean are likely to produce in wars between\r\nmaritime states. We can not yet see the extent to which this power may\r\nbe applied in belligerent operations, connecting itself as it does with\r\nrecent improvements in the science of gunnery and projectiles; but we\r\nneed have no fear of being left, in regard to these things, behind the\r\nmost active and skillful of other nations if the genius and enterprise\r\nof our fellow-citizens receive proper encouragement and direction from\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nTrue wisdom would nevertheless seem to dictate the necessity of placing\r\nin perfect condition those fortifications which are designed for the\r\nprotection of our principal cities and roadsteads. For the defense of\r\nour extended maritime coast our chief reliance should be placed on\r\nour Navy, aided by those inventions which are destined to recommend\r\nthemselves to public adoption, but no time should be lost in placing our\r\nprincipal cities on the seaboard and the Lakes in a state of entire\r\nsecurity from foreign assault. Separated as we are from the countries of\r\nthe Old World, and in much unaffected by their policy, we are happily\r\nrelieved from the necessity of maintaining large standing armies in\r\ntimes of peace. The policy which was adopted by Mr. Monroe shortly after\r\nthe conclusion of the late war with Great Britain of preserving a\r\nregularly organized staff sufficient for the command of a large military\r\nforce should a necessity for one arise is founded as well in economy as\r\nin true wisdom. Provision is thus made, upon filling up the rank and\r\nfile, which can readily be done on any emergency, for the introduction\r\nof a system of discipline both promptly and efficiently. All that is\r\nrequired in time of peace is to maintain a sufficient number of men\r\nto guard our fortifications, to meet any sudden contingency, and to\r\nencounter the first shock of war. Our chief reliance must be placed on\r\nthe militia; they constitute the great body of national guards, and,\r\ninspired by an ardent love of country, will be found ready at all times\r\nand at all seasons to repair with alacrity to its defense. It will be\r\nregarded by Congress, I doubt not, at a suitable time as one of its\r\nhighest duties to attend to their complete organization and discipline.\r\n\r\nThe state of the navy pension fund requires the immediate attention of\r\nCongress. By the operation of the act of the 3d of March, 1837, entitled\r\n\"An act for the more equitable administration of the navy pension fund,\"\r\nthat fund has been exhausted. It will be seen from the accompanying\r\nreport of the Commissioner of Pensions that there will be required for\r\nthe payment of navy pensions on the 1st of July next $88,706.06-1/3, and\r\non the 1st of January, 1842, the sum of $69,000. In addition to these\r\nsums, about $6,000 will be required to pay arrears of pensions which\r\nwill probably be allowed between the 1st of July and the 1st of January,\r\n1842, making in the whole $163,706.06-1/3. To meet these payments there\r\nis within the control of the Department the sum of $28,040, leaving a\r\ndeficiency of $139,666.06-1/3. The public faith requires that immediate\r\nprovision should be made for the payment of these sums.\r\n\r\nIn order to introduce into the Navy a desirable efficiency, a new system\r\nof accountability may be found to be indispensably necessary. To mature\r\na plan having for its object the accomplishment of an end so important\r\nand to meet the just expectations of the country require more time than\r\nhas yet been allowed to the Secretary at the head of the Department. The\r\nhope is indulged that by the time of your next regular session measures\r\nof importance in connection with this branch of the public service may\r\nbe matured for your consideration.\r\n\r\nAlthough the laws regulating the Post-Office Department only require\r\nfrom the officer charged with its direction to report at the usual\r\nannual session of Congress, the Postmaster-General has presented to me\r\nsome facts connected with the financial condition of the Department\r\nwhich are deemed worthy the attention of Congress. By the accompanying\r\nreport of that officer it appears the existing liabilities of that\r\nDepartment beyond the means of payment at its command can not be less\r\nthan $500,000. As the laws organizing that branch of the public service\r\nconfine the expenditure to its own revenues, deficiencies therein\r\ncan not be presented under the usual estimates for the expenses of\r\nGovernment. It must therefore be left to Congress to determine whether\r\nthe moneys now due the contractors shall be paid from the public\r\nTreasury or whether that Department shall continue under its present\r\nembarrassments. It will be seen by the report of the Postmaster-General\r\nthat the recent lettings of contracts in several of the States have been\r\nmade at such reduced rates of compensation as to encourage the belief\r\nthat if the Department was relieved from existing difficulties its\r\nfuture operations might be conducted without any further call upon the\r\ngeneral Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe power of appointing to office is one of a character the most\r\ndelicate and responsible. The appointing power is evermore exposed to be\r\nled into error. With anxious solicitude to select the most trustworthy\r\nfor official station, I can not be supposed to possess a personal\r\nknowledge of the qualifications of every applicant. I deem it,\r\ntherefore, proper in this most public manner to invite on the part of\r\nthe Senate a just scrutiny into the character and pretensions of every\r\nperson I may bring to their notice in the regular form of a nomination\r\nfor office. Unless persons every way trustworthy are employed in the\r\npublic service, corruption and irregularity will inevitably follow.\r\nI shall with the greatest cheerfulness acquiesce in the decision of\r\nthat body, and, regarding it as wisely constituted to aid the executive\r\ndepartment in the performance of this delicate duty, I shall look to its\r\n\"consent and advice\" as given only in furtherance of the best interests\r\nof the country. I shall also at the earliest proper occasion invite the\r\nattention of Congress to such measures as in my judgment will be best\r\ncalculated to regulate and control the Executive power in reference to\r\nthis vitally important subject.\r\n\r\nI shall also at the proper season invite your attention to the\r\nstatutory enactments for the suppression of the slave trade, which may\r\nrequire to be rendered more efficient in their provisions. There is\r\nreason to believe that the traffic is on the increase. Whether such\r\nincrease is to be ascribed to the abolition of slave labor in the\r\nBritish possessions in our vicinity and an attendant diminution in the\r\nsupply of those articles which enter into the general consumption of\r\nthe world, thereby augmenting the demand from other quarters, and thus\r\ncalling for additional labor, it were needless to inquire. The highest\r\nconsiderations of public honor as well as the strongest promptings of\r\nhumanity require a resort to the most vigorous efforts to suppress the\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I beg to invite your particular attention to the interests\r\nof this District; nor do I doubt but that in a liberal spirit of\r\nlegislation you will seek to advance its commercial as well as its local\r\ninterests. Should Congress deem it to be its duty to repeal the existing\r\nsubtreasury law, the necessity of providing a suitable place of deposit\r\nof the public moneys which may be required within the District must be\r\napparent to all.\r\n\r\nI have felt it due to the country to present the foregoing topics to\r\nyour consideration and reflection. Others with which it might not seem\r\nproper to trouble you at an extraordinary session will be laid before\r\nyou at a future day. I am happy in committing the important affairs of\r\nthe country into your hands. The tendency of public sentiment, I am\r\npleased to believe, is toward the adoption, in a spirit of union and\r\nharmony, of such measures as will fortify the public interests. To\r\ncherish such a tendency of public opinion is the task of an elevated\r\npatriotism. That differences of opinion as to the means of accomplishing\r\nthese desirable objects should exist is reasonably to be expected. Nor\r\ncan all be made satisfied with any system of measures; but I flatter\r\nmyself with the hope that the great body of the people will readily\r\nunite in support of those whose efforts spring from a disinterested\r\ndesire to promote their happiness, to preserve the Federal and State\r\nGovernments within their respective orbits; to cultivate peace with\r\nall the nations of the earth on just and honorable grounds; to exact\r\nobedience to the laws; to intrench liberty and property in full\r\nsecurity; and, consulting the most rigid economy, to abolish all\r\nuseless expenses.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY OF WASHINGTON, _June 2, 1841_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nexhibiting certain transfers of appropriations that have been made in\r\nthat Department in pursuance of the power vested in the President of the\r\nUnited States by the act of Congress of the 3d of March, 1809, entitled\r\n\"An act further to amend the several acts for the establishment and\r\nregulation of the Treasury, War, and Navy Departments.\"\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 17, 1841_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate the inclosed communication[1] from the\r\nSecretary of State, in answer to a resolution of the Senate of the 12th\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Relating to the commissioners appointed to investigate the\r\ncondition of the public works in Washington, D.C., and transmitting\r\ncopy of the letter of instructions issued to them.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 17, 1841_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate the inclosed communication from the Secretary\r\nof State, in answer to a resolution of the Senate of the 12th instant.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE, _June 15, 1841_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nSIR: In answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 12th instant,\r\ncalling for \"any orders which may have been issued to the officers of\r\nthe Army and Navy in relation to political offenses in elections,\" etc.,\r\nI inclose a copy of the circular letter addressed, under the direction\r\nof the President, by this Department to the heads of the other\r\nDepartments, and know of no other order to which the resolution can be\r\nsupposed to have reference.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nDANIEL WEBSTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE, _March 20, 1841_.\r\n\r\nSIR: The President is of opinion that it is a great abuse to bring the\r\npatronage of the General Government into conflict with the freedom of\r\nelections, and that this abuse ought to be corrected wherever it may\r\nhave been permitted to exist, and to be prevented for the future.\r\n\r\nHe therefore directs that information be given to all officers and\r\nagents in your department of the public service that partisan\r\ninterference in popular elections, whether of State officers or officers\r\nof this Government, and for whomsoever or against whomsoever it may be\r\nexercised, or the payment of any contribution or assessment on salaries,\r\nor official compensation for party or election purposes, will be\r\nregarded by him as cause of removal.\r\n\r\nIt is not intended that any officer shall be restrained in the free and\r\nproper expression and maintenance of his opinions respecting public men\r\nor public measures, or in the exercise to the fullest degree of the\r\nconstitutional right of suffrage. But persons employed under the\r\nGovernment and paid for their services out of the public Treasury are\r\nnot expected to take an active or officious part in attempts to\r\ninfluence the minds or votes of others, such conduct being deemed\r\ninconsistent with the spirit of the Constitution and the duties of\r\npublic agents acting under it; and the President is resolved, so far as\r\ndepends upon him, that while the exercise of the elective franchise by\r\nthe people shall be free from undue influences of official station and\r\nauthority, opinion shall also be free among the officers and agents of\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nThe President wishes it further to be announced and distinctly\r\nunderstood that from all collecting and disbursing officers promptitude\r\nin rendering accounts and entire punctuality in paying balances will be\r\nrigorously exacted. In his opinion it is time to return in this respect\r\nto the early practice of the Government, and to hold any degree of\r\ndelinquency on the part of those intrusted with the public money just\r\ncause of immediate removal. He deems the severe observance of this rule\r\nto be essential to the public service, as every dollar lost to the\r\nTreasury by unfaithfulness in office creates a necessity for a new\r\ncharge upon the people.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nDANIEL WEBSTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _June 18, 1841_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate a report from the Secretary of the Navy, with\r\naccompanying documents,[2] in answer to their resolution of the 12th\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Correspondence of the minister in England with the officers\r\nof the Mediterranean Squadron, in consequence of which the squadron left\r\nthat station, and the dispatches of Captain Bolton to the Secretary of\r\nthe Navy connected with that movement.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June, 1841_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to transmit to the Senate the accompanying letter[3]\r\nfrom the Secretary of the Treasury, in pursuance of its resolution of the\r\n8th instant.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Relating to allowances since March 4, 1841, of claims\r\narising under the invasion of East Florida in 1812.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 22, 1841_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to submit the accompanying correspondence between\r\nmyself and the Hon. J. Burnet, J.C. Wright, and others, who arrived\r\nsome days ago in this city as a committee on behalf of the people of\r\nCincinnati for the purpose, with the assent of the family, of removing\r\nthe remains of the late President of the United States to North Bend for\r\ninterment. I have thought it to be my duty thus to apprise Congress of\r\nthe contemplated proceedings.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _June 16, 1841_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: The undersigned were appointed by the citizens and the\r\ncity council of Cincinnati and by many of the surviving soldiers\r\nof the late war to apply to the widow and family of our distinguished\r\nfellow-citizen, the late President of the United States, for permission\r\nto remove his remains from the city of Washington to the State of Ohio\r\nfor interment. They have made the application directed, and have\r\nreceived permission to perform that sacred trust. They have now the\r\nhonor of reporting to you their arrival in this city, and of asking your\r\napprobation of the measure contemplated and your cooperation in carrying\r\nit into effect.\r\n\r\nWe are fully aware of the high estimate you placed on the talents and\r\nvirtues of our lamented friend and fellow-citizen, the late Chief\r\nMagistrate of the Union, whose friendship and confidence you possessed\r\nmany years. We saw the tear fall from your eye and mingle with the tears\r\nof the nation when the inscrutable will of Heaven removed him from us.\r\n\r\nKnowing these things, we approach you with confidence, well assured that\r\nyou will justly appreciate our motive for undertaking the mournful duty\r\nwe have been deputed to perform, and that the same kind feeling which\r\nhas marked your course through life will prompt you on this occasion to\r\nafford us your countenance, and, if necessary, your cooperation.\r\n\r\nIf it meet your approbation, the committee will do themselves the honor\r\nof waiting upon you at the President's house at any hour you may please\r\nto designate.\r\n\r\nWith high respect, we are, your friends and fellow-citizens,\r\n\r\nJ. BURNET.\r\n  J.C. WRIGHT.\r\n    [AND 10 OTHERS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 17, 1841_.\r\n\r\nJ. BURNET, J.C. WRIGHT, AND OTHERS OF THE COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: Your letter of the 16th was duly handed me, and I lose\r\nno time in responding to the feelings and sentiments which you have\r\nexpressed for yourselves and those you represent, and which you have\r\ncorrectly ascribed to me in regard to the lamented death of the late\r\nPresident. As a citizen I respected him; as a patriot I honored him;\r\nas a friend he was near and dear to me. That the people of Cincinnati\r\nshould desire to keep watch over his remains by entombing them near\r\ntheir city is both natural and becoming; that the entire West, where so\r\nmany evidences of his public usefulness are to be found, should unite in\r\nthe same wish was to have been expected; and that the surviving soldiers\r\nof his many battles, led on by him to victory and to glory, should sigh\r\nto perform the last melancholy duties to the remains of their old\r\ncommander is fully in consonance with the promptings of a noble and\r\ngenerous sympathy. I could not, if I was authorized to do so, oppose\r\nmyself to their wishes. I might find something to urge on behalf of his\r\nnative State in my knowledge of his continued attachment to her through\r\nthe whole period of his useful life; in the claims of his relatives\r\nthere, whose desire it would be that the mortal remains of the\r\nillustrious son should sleep under the same turf with those of his\r\ndistinguished father, one of the signers of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence; in the wish of the citizens of his native county to claim\r\nall that is now left of him for whom they so lately cast their almost\r\nunanimous suffrage; to say nothing of my own feelings, allied as I am\r\nby blood to many of his near relatives, and with our names so closely\r\nassociated in much connected with the late exciting political contest.\r\nThese considerations might present some reasonable ground for opposing\r\nyour wishes; but the assent which has been given by his respected widow\r\nand nearest relatives to the request of the people of Cincinnati admits\r\nof no opposition on my part, neither in my individual nor official\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nI shall feel it to be my duty, however, to submit our correspondence to\r\nthe two Houses of Congress, now in session, but anticipating no effort\r\nfrom that quarter to thwart the wishes expressed by yourselves in\r\nconsonance with those of the widow and nearest relatives of the late\r\nPresident. I readily promise you my cooperation toward enabling you to\r\nfulfill the sacred trust which brought you to this city.\r\n\r\nI tender to each of you, gentlemen, my cordial salutations.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[NOTE.--The remains of the late President of the United States were\r\nremoved from Washington to North Bend, Ohio, June 26, 1841.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 29, 1841_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 14th instant, I\r\nhave the honor to submit the accompanying reports from the Secretary of\r\nState and Secretary of the Treasury, which embrace all the information\r\npossessed by the executive department upon that subject.[4]\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Payment or assumption of State stocks by the General\r\nGovernment.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 30, 1841_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe accompanying memorial in favor of the passage of a bankrupt law,\r\nsigned by nearly 3,000 of the inhabitants of the city of New York, has\r\nbeen forwarded to me, attended by a request that I would submit it to\r\nthe consideration of Congress. I can not waive a compliance with a\r\nrequest urged upon me by so large and respectable a number of my\r\nfellow-citizens. That a bankrupt law, carefully guarded against\r\nfraudulent practices and embracing as far as practicable all classes of\r\nsociety--the failure to do which has heretofore constituted a prominent\r\nobjection to the measure--would afford extensive relief I do not doubt.\r\nThe distress incident to the derangements of some years past has visited\r\nlarge numbers of our fellow-citizens with hopeless insolvency, whose\r\nenergies, both mental and physical, by reason of the load of debt\r\npressing upon them, are lost to the country. Whether Congress shall deem\r\nit proper to enter upon the consideration of this subject at its present\r\nextraordinary session it will doubtless wisely determine. I have\r\nfulfilled my duty to the memorialists in submitting their petition to\r\nyour consideration.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 1, 1841_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor herewith to submit to the Senate the copy of a letter\r\naddressed by myself to Mrs. Harrison in compliance with the resolutions\r\nof Congress, and her reply thereto.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[The same message was sent to the House of Representatives.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 13, 1841_.\r\n\r\nMrs. ANNA HARRISON.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MADAM: The accompanying resolutions, adopted by the Senate and\r\nHouse of Representatives of the United States, will convey to you an\r\nexpression of the deep sympathy felt by the representatives of the\r\nStates and of the people in the sad bereavement which yourself and the\r\ncountry have sustained in the death of your illustrious husband.

Doty, governor\r\nof Wisconsin, who was appointed a commissioner on the part of the United\r\nStates for the purpose of negotiating the treaty; and I desire to submit\r\nthe following facts and opinions inducing me to request its favorable\r\nconsideration:\r\n\r\nIt was known on my entering upon the duties of the Department of War\r\nthat some provision must speedily be made for the Winnebago Indians in\r\nthe Northwest. By the treaty with those Indians in 1837 it was provided\r\nthat they should move temporarily upon a narrow strip of country west of\r\nthe Mississippi River, called the neutral ground, from the object of its\r\npurchase in 1830. That strip of country is only 40 miles in width, 20\r\nmiles of it having been purchased from the Sac and Fox Indians and 20\r\nmiles from the Sioux, the object of the purchase having been to place a\r\nbarrier between those tribes, which had been for many years at war and\r\nparties of which were continually meeting and destroying each other upon\r\nor adjacent to the country purchased.\r\n\r\nWhen the delegation of Winnebago chiefs was in Washington negotiating\r\na sale of all their lands east of the Mississippi River, in 1837, a\r\npermanent location for those Indians was not fixed upon, and a temporary\r\nexpedient was adopted, and acceded to by the Indians, by which they\r\nagreed, within eight months from the ratification of the treaty, to move\r\nupon and occupy a portion of the neutral ground until they should select\r\na permanent home.\r\n\r\nOwing to the small extent of country thus temporarily assigned to the\r\nWinnebagoes, utterly destitute of all preparation for the reception of\r\nthem, slenderly supplied with game, and, above all, the circumstance\r\nthat the Sac and Fox Indians were continually at war with the Sioux,\r\nthe object of the purchase having utterly failed, the neutral ground,\r\nso called, proving literally the fighting ground of the hostile\r\ntribes--owing to all these circumstances the Winnebagoes were extremely\r\nreluctant to comply with the treaty. It was in part a dictate of\r\nhumanity to give them more time for removal than that allotted in the\r\ntreaty, in the hope of effecting their permanent removal beyond the\r\nMissouri or elsewhere; but as no steps were taken to select their future\r\nhome, and as the white settlers in Wisconsin were fast crowding upon the\r\nIndians, overrunning the country, as usual, in search of town sites,\r\nwater privileges, and farming districts, it became absolutely necessary\r\nto make some efforts toward carrying the treaty into effect. Owing to\r\nthe excited state of the Indians and the apprehension of disturbance,\r\nthe Eighth Regiment of Infantry, in 1840, more than two years, instead\r\nof eight months, after the ratification of the treaty, was ordered upon\r\nthe Winnebago frontier, the greater part of the Fifth Regiment being\r\nalready there, and in the presence of that force the Indians were\r\nrequired to comply with the treaty. They reluctantly removed from the\r\nbanks of the Wisconsin River and crossed the Mississippi, but did not\r\ngo to that portion of the neutral ground agreed upon, which commenced\r\n20 miles from the river, but instead of it they spread themselves along\r\nthe bank of the Mississippi, some of them recrossing that river and\r\nascending the Chippewa and Black rivers. Only a small portion of the\r\ntribe has yet removed to the portion of the neutral ground assigned to\r\nthem, and it is perhaps fortunate that local attachments have not been\r\nformed, since, from the position of the country, it was not and never\r\ncould have been intended as their permanent home.\r\n\r\nAfter a careful examination of the country in the Northwest the\r\nimportance of providing for the Winnebago Indians, though immediate,\r\nbecame secondary in a more national and wider prospect of benefits in\r\nfuture years by arrangements which presented themselves to my mind as\r\nnot only practicable, but of easy accomplishment.\r\n\r\nA glance at the map and at the efforts hitherto made in emigration will\r\nshow an extensive body of Indians accumulated upon the Southwestern\r\nfrontier, and, looking to the numbers yet to be emigrated from within\r\nthe circle of territory soon to become States of the American Union, it\r\nwill appear upon very many considerations to be of the utmost importance\r\nto separate the Indians and to interpose a barrier between the masses\r\nwhich are destined to be placed upon the western frontier, instead of\r\naccumulating them within limits enabling them to unite and in concert\r\nspread desolation over the States of Missouri and Arkansas to, perhaps,\r\nthe banks of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nEntertaining these views, it was determined to open negotiations with\r\nthe Sioux Indians north and northwest of the purchase of 1830, the\r\nneutral ground, so called, with the purpose of purchasing sufficient\r\nterritory beyond the reasonable limits of Iowa to provide a resting\r\nplace for the Winnebagoes, intending to treat also with the Sac and Fox\r\nIndians and with the Potawatamies north of the State of Missouri, and\r\nthus enable our citizens to expand west of the Missouri River north of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to state in a condensed report all the reasons now\r\nimperatively urging the adoption of these measures. Besides the absolute\r\nnecessity of providing a home for the Winnebagoes, the citizens of Iowa\r\nand of Missouri are crowding upon the territory of the Sac and Fox\r\nIndians and already producing those irritations which in former times\r\nhave led to bloody wars. It is not to be for a moment concealed that our\r\nenterprising and hardy population must and will occupy the territory\r\nadjacent to that purchased in 1837 from the Sacs and Foxes, and the only\r\npossible mode of its being done in peace is by another purchase from\r\nthose Indians. But the position of the Potawatamies will then become\r\nrelatively what that of the Sac and Fox Indians now is, with the\r\ndifference that access to their country by the Missouri River will\r\nhasten its occupancy by our people. The only mode of guarding against\r\nfuture collision, near at hand if not provided against, is by emigrating\r\nnot only the Sac and Fox Indians, but also the Potawatamies.\r\n\r\nGreat efforts have been made to induce those Indians, as also the\r\nWinnebagoes, to move south of the Missouri, but without effect, their\r\nopposition to it being apparently insurmountable, the Potawatamies\r\nexpressing the most decided aversion to it on being urged to join other\r\nbands of Potawatamies on the Marais de Cygne, declaring that they would\r\nrather at once go to California, being determined not to unite with\r\nthose bands, but to maintain an independence of them. By the purchase\r\nfrom the Sioux no doubt is entertained that their prejudices may be\r\nadvantageously accommodated, for among the objects in contemplation\r\nbefore adverted to it is to my mind of primary importance so to dispose\r\nof those Indians as to enable this Government to interpose a State\r\nbetween the Northern and Southern Indians along the Missouri River,\r\nand thus, by dividing the Indians on the frontier and separating the\r\ndivisions, prevent a combination and concert of action which future\r\nprogress in civilization might otherwise enable them to effect in the\r\nprosecution of revenge for real or imagined grievances.\r\n\r\nGreat importance is attached to this view of the subject, but scarcely\r\nless to the means provided by the treaty for inducing the remnants of\r\nother Northern tribes to remove to a climate congenial to their habits\r\nand disposition.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest efforts at emigration certain Northern Indians have\r\nstrenuously objected to a removal south of the Missouri on account\r\nof the climate; and where tribes have been induced to dispose of all\r\nright to live east of the Mississippi within the United States, many\r\nindividuals, dreading their southern destination, have wandered to the\r\nnorth and are now living in Canada, annually in the receipt of presents\r\nfrom the British Government, and will be ready without doubt to side\r\nwith that power in any future conflict with this Government. In this\r\nmanner considerable numbers of the Delawares and Shawnees and other\r\nIndians have disappeared from our settlements--a fact of great\r\nimportance, and which I apprehend has not been heretofore sufficiently\r\nconsidered. There are many Potawatamies and Ottawas, as also Winnebagoes\r\nand Menomonees, who may be easily induced to move into Canada by\r\nseductive bribes, in the use of which the British Government has always\r\ndisplayed a remarkable foresight.\r\n\r\nOf the Chippewas and Ottawas now in the northern part of Michigan\r\nit is believed there are over 5,000 under treaty obligations to remove\r\nto the Southwest, the greater portion of whom openly declared their\r\ndetermination to cross the line into Canada and put themselves under\r\nthe protection of the British Government in preference to a removal\r\nto that country. These Indians may be accommodated by the arrangements\r\nin contemplation, not only to their own satisfaction, but under\r\ncircumstances promising the greatest permanent advantages to the\r\nUnited States, and separating them from all inducements and even the\r\npossibility of entering the British service. I am not without hope,\r\nalso, that through this treaty some suitable and acceptable arrangement\r\nmay be made with the New York Indians by which they may be removed with\r\nsafety to themselves and benefit to the people of that State. The very\r\npeculiar situation of these Indians is well known; that while they are\r\nunder treaty obligation to remove, the treaty being by the Constitution\r\nthe supreme law of the land and perfecting in this instance the title\r\nof the land they occupy in a private land company, there is yet every\r\nreason to sympathize with them and the highest moral inducements for\r\nextending every possible relief to them within the legitimate powers of\r\nthe Government. I have been assured from sources entitled to my fullest\r\nconfidence that although these Indians have hitherto expressed the most\r\ndecided aversion to a removal south of the Missouri, there will probably\r\nbe no difficulty in persuading them to occupy a more northern region in\r\nthe West. I have every reason for believing that a benevolent interest\r\nin their behalf among a portion of our own people, which, it is\r\nsupposed, has heretofore presented an obstacle to their emigration, will\r\nbe exerted to effect their removal if a portion of the Sioux country can\r\nbe appropriated to them.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived, therefore, that a multitude of objects thus rest\r\nupon the success of this one treaty, now submitted for examination and\r\napprobation.\r\n\r\nOf the Sioux Indians I will but remark that they occupy an immense\r\ncountry spreading from the Mississippi north of the neutral ground west\r\nand northwest, crossing the Missouri River more than 1,200 miles above\r\nthe city of St. Louis. They are divided into bands, which have various\r\nnames, the generic name for the whole being the Dahcota Nation. These\r\nbands, though speaking a common language, are independent in their\r\noccupancy of portions of country, and separate treaties may be made with\r\nthem. Treaties are already subsisting with some of the bands both on the\r\nMississippi and Missouri. The treaty now submitted is believed to be\r\nadvantageous, and from its provisions contemplates the reduction of\r\nthose wandering Indians from their nomadic habits to those of an\r\nagricultural people.\r\n\r\nIf some of the provisions seem not such as might be desired, it will be\r\nrecollected that many interests have to be accommodated in framing an\r\nIndian treaty which can only be fully known to the commissioner, who\r\nderives his information directly from the Indians in the country which\r\nis the object of the purchase.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to add that I had instructed the commissioner expressly not\r\nto take into consideration what are called traders' claims, in the hope\r\nof correcting a practice which, it is believed, has been attended with\r\nmischievous consequences; but the commissioner has by a letter of\r\nexplanations fully satisfied me that in this instance it was absolutely\r\nnecessary to accommodate those claims as an indispensable means of\r\nobtaining the assent of the Indians to the treaty. This results,\r\ndoubtless, from their dependence upon the traders for articles, in a\r\nmeasure necessaries, which are for the most part furnished without\r\ncompetition, and of the proper value of which the Indians are ignorant.\r\n\r\nTo compensate in some degree for the article in this treaty providing\r\nfor the payment of traders' claims, very judicious guards are introduced\r\ninto the treaty, calculated effectually to exclude that source of\r\ninterest adverse to the Government in all future time within the\r\npurchase under this treaty.\r\n\r\nThere are other articles in the treaty which I have not been able fully\r\nto realize as judicious or necessary, but for reasons already stated\r\nthey deserve respectful consideration.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the article stipulating that a rejection of any of the\r\nprovisions of the treaty should render the whole null and void, I would\r\nrespectfully recommend such modified acceptance of the treaty as in the\r\nwisdom of the Senate may seem just and proper, conditioned upon the\r\nassent of the Indians subsequently to be obtained, the Senate making\r\nprovision for its reference back to the Indians if necessary.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the treaty provides for a power of regulation in\r\nthe Indian Territory by the United States Government under circumstances\r\nnot hitherto attempted, presenting an opportunity for an experiment well\r\nworthy of mature consideration.\r\n\r\nI ought not to dismiss this subject without adverting to one other\r\nimportant consideration connected with the integrity of our Northwest\r\nIndians and Territory. The Sioux treaty will effectually withdraw from\r\nBritish influence all those who are a party to it by making them\r\nstipendiaries of the United States and by operating a change in their\r\nwandering habits and establishing them at known and fixed points under\r\nthe observation of Government agents, and as the British can only have\r\naccess to that region by the way of Fond du Lac, one or two small\r\nmilitary posts in a direction west and south from that point, it is\r\nbelieved, will completely control all intercourse with the Indians in\r\nthat section of country.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJNO. BELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _September 6, 1841_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor, in compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the\r\n8th June, to communicate a letter[13] from the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nand the correspondence accompanying it.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Relating to the deposits of public moneys in banks by\r\ndisbursing officers and agents.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _September 13, 1841_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 14th July last,\r\nI communicate to the Senate a report from the Secretary of State,\r\naccompanied by copies of the correspondence[14] called for by said\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Relating to the origin, progress, and conclusion of the\r\ntreaty of November 26, 1838, between Sardinia and the United States.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 16, 1841_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe bill entitled \"An act to incorporate the subscribers to the Fiscal\r\nBank of the United States,\" which originated in the Senate, has been\r\nconsidered by me with a sincere desire to conform my action in regard\r\nto it to that of the two Houses of Congress. By the Constitution it\r\nis made my duty either to approve the bill by signing it or to return\r\nit with my objections to the House in which it originated. I can not\r\nconscientiously give it my approval, and I proceed to discharge the duty\r\nrequired of me by the Constitution--to give my reasons for disapproving.\r\n\r\nThe power of Congress to create a national bank to operate _per se_\r\nover the Union has been a question of dispute from the origin of the\r\nGovernment. Men most justly and deservedly esteemed for their high\r\nintellectual endowments, their virtue, and their patriotism have in\r\nregard to it entertained different and conflicting opinions; Congresses\r\nhave differed; the approval of one President has been followed by the\r\ndisapproval of another; the people at different times have acquiesced in\r\ndecisions both for and against. The country has been and still is deeply\r\nagitated by this unsettled question. It will suffice for me to say that\r\nmy own opinion has been uniformly proclaimed to be against the exercise\r\nof any such power by this Government. On all suitable occasions during\r\na period of twenty-five years the opinion thus entertained has been\r\nunreservedly expressed. I declared it in the legislature of my native\r\nState; in the House of Representatives of the United States it has been\r\nopenly vindicated by me; in the Senate Chamber, in the presence and\r\nhearing of many who are at this time members of that body, it has been\r\naffirmed and reaffirmed in speeches and reports there made and by votes\r\nthere recorded; in popular assemblies I have unhesitatingly announced\r\nit, and the last public declaration which I made--and that but a short\r\ntime before the late Presidential election--I referred to my previously\r\nexpressed opinions as being those then entertained by me. With a full\r\nknowledge of the opinions thus entertained and never concealed, I was\r\nelected by the people Vice-President of the United States. By the\r\noccurrence of a contingency provided for in the Constitution and arising\r\nunder an impressive dispensation of Providence I succeeded to the\r\nPresidential office. Before entering upon the duties of that office\r\nI took an oath that I would \"preserve, protect, and defend the\r\nConstitution of the United States.\" Entertaining the opinions alluded\r\nto and having taken this oath, the Senate and the country will see that\r\nI could not give my sanction to a measure of the character described\r\nwithout surrendering all claim to the respect of honorable men, all\r\nconfidence on the part of the people, all self-respect, all regard for\r\nmoral and religious obligations, without an observance of which no\r\ngovernment can be prosperous and no people can be happy. It would be to\r\ncommit a crime which I would not willfully commit to gain any earthly\r\nreward, and which would justly subject me to the ridicule and scorn of\r\nall virtuous men.\r\n\r\nI deem it entirely unnecessary at this time to enter upon the reasons\r\nwhich have brought my mind to the convictions I feel and entertain on\r\nthis subject. They have been over and over again repeated. If some of\r\nthose who have preceded me in this high office have entertained and\r\navowed different opinions, I yield all confidence that their convictions\r\nwere sincere. I claim only to have the same measure meted out to myself.\r\nWithout going further into the argument, I will say that in looking to\r\nthe powers of this Government to collect, safely keep, and disburse the\r\npublic revenue, and incidentally to regulate the commerce and exchanges,\r\nI have not been able to satisfy myself that the establishment by this\r\nGovernment of a bank of discount in the ordinary acceptation of that\r\nterm was a necessary means or one demanded by propriety to execute those\r\npowers. What can the local discounts of the bank have to do with the\r\ncollecting, safe-keeping, and disbursing of the revenue? So far as the\r\nmere discounting of paper is concerned, it is quite immaterial to this\r\nquestion whether the discount is obtained at a State bank or a United\r\nStates bank. They are both equally local, both beginning and both ending\r\nin a local accommodation. What influence have local discounts granted by\r\nany form of bank in the regulating of the currency and the exchanges?\r\nLet the history of the late United States Bank aid us in answering this\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nFor several years after the establishment of that institution it dealt\r\nalmost exclusively in local discounts, and during that period the\r\ncountry was for the most part disappointed in the consequences\r\nanticipated from its incorporation. A uniform currency was not provided,\r\nexchanges were not regulated, and little or nothing was added to the\r\ngeneral circulation, and in 1820 its embarrassments had become so great\r\nthat the directors petitioned Congress to repeal that article of the\r\ncharter which made its notes receivable everywhere in payment of the\r\npublic dues. It had up to that period dealt to but a very small extent\r\nin exchanges, either foreign or domestic, and as late as 1823 its\r\noperations in that line amounted to a little more than $7,000,000 per\r\nannum. A very rapid augmentation soon after occurred, and in 1833 its\r\ndealings in the exchanges amounted to upward of $100,000,000, including\r\nthe sales of its own drafts; and all these immense transactions were\r\neffected without the employment of extraordinary means. The currency of\r\nthe country became sound, and the negotiations in the exchanges were\r\ncarried on at the lowest possible rates. The circulation was increased\r\nto more than $22,000,000 and the notes of the bank were regarded as\r\nequal to specie all over the country, thus showing almost conclusively\r\nthat it was the capacity to deal in exchanges, and not in local\r\ndiscounts, which furnished these facilities and advantages. It may be\r\nremarked, too, that notwithstanding the immense transactions of the bank\r\nin the purchase of exchange, the losses sustained were merely nominal,\r\nwhile in the line of discounts the suspended debt was enormous and\r\nproved most disastrous to the bank and the country. Its power of local\r\ndiscount has in fact proved to be a fruitful source of favoritism and\r\ncorruption, alike destructive to the public morals and to the general\r\nweal.\r\n\r\nThe capital invested in banks of discount in the United States, created\r\nby the States, at this time exceeds $350,000,000, and if the discounting\r\nof local paper could have produced any beneficial effects the United\r\nStates ought to possess the soundest currency in the world; but the\r\nreverse is lamentably the fact.\r\n\r\nIs the measure now under consideration of the objectionable character\r\nto which I have alluded? It is clearly so unless by the sixteenth\r\nfundamental article of the eleventh section it is made otherwise. That\r\narticle is in the following words:\r\n\r\n  The directors of the said corporation shall establish one competent\r\n  office of discount and deposit in any State in which two thousand shares\r\n  shall have been subscribed or may be held, whenever, upon application of\r\n  the legislature of such State, Congress may by law require the same. And\r\n  the said directors may also establish one or more competent offices of\r\n  discount and deposit in any Territory or District of the United States,\r\n  and in any State with the assent of such State, and when established the\r\n  said office or offices shall be only withdrawn or removed by the said\r\n  directors prior to the expiration of this charter with the previous\r\n  assent of Congress: _Provided_, In respect to any State which shall not,\r\n  at the first session of the legislature thereof held after the passage\r\n  of this act, by resolution or other usual legislative proceeding,\r\n  unconditionally assent or dissent to the establishment of such office\r\n  or offices within it, such assent of the said State shall be thereafter\r\n  presumed: _And provided, nevertheless_, That whenever it shall become\r\n  necessary and proper for carrying into execution any of the powers\r\n  granted by the Constitution to establish an office or offices in any of\r\n  the States whatever, and the establishment thereof shall be directed by\r\n  law, it shall be the duty of the said directors to establish such office\r\n  or offices accordingly.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that by this clause the directors are invested with the\r\nfullest power to establish a branch in any State which has yielded its\r\nassent; and having once established such branch, it shall not afterwards\r\nbe withdrawn except by order of Congress. Such assent is to be _implied_\r\nand to have the force and sanction of an actually expressed assent,\r\n\"provided, in respect to any State which shall not, at _the first\r\nsession_ of the legislature thereof held after the passage of this act,\r\nby _resolution_ or _other usual legislative proceeding, unconditionally_\r\nassent or dissent to the establishment of such office or offices within\r\nit, such assent of said State shall be thereafter presumed.\" The assent\r\nor dissent is to be expressed _unconditionally at the first session of\r\nthe legislature, by some formal legislative act;_ and if not so\r\nexpressed its assent is to be _implied_, and the directors are thereupon\r\ninvested with power, at such time thereafter as they may please, to\r\nestablish branches, which can not afterwards be withdrawn except by\r\nresolve of Congress. No matter what may be the cause which may operate\r\nwith the legislature, which either prevents it from speaking or\r\naddresses itself to its wisdom, to induce delay, its assent is to be\r\nimplied. This iron rule is to give way to no circumstances; it is\r\nunbending and inflexible. It is the language of the master to the\r\nvassal; an unconditional answer is claimed forthwith, and delay,\r\npostponement, or incapacity to answer produces an implied assent which\r\nis ever after irrevocable. Many of the State elections have already\r\ntaken place without any knowledge on the part of the people that such a\r\nquestion was to come up. The representatives may desire a submission of\r\nthe question to their constituents preparatory to final action upon it,\r\nbut this high privilege is denied; whatever may be the motives and views\r\nentertained by the representatives of the people to induce delay, their\r\nassent is to be presumed, and is ever afterwards binding unless their\r\ndissent shall be unconditionally expressed at their first session after\r\nthe passage of this bill into a law. They may by formal resolution\r\ndeclare the question of assent or dissent to be undecided and postponed,\r\nand yet, in opposition to their express declaration to the contrary,\r\ntheir assent is to be implied. Cases innumerable might be cited to\r\nmanifest the irrationality of such an inference. Let one or two in\r\naddition suffice. The popular branch of the legislature may express its\r\ndissent by an unanimous vote, and its resolution may be defeated by\r\na tie vote of the senate, and yet the assent is to be implied. Both\r\nbranches of the legislature may concur in a resolution of decided\r\ndissent, and yet the governor may exert the _veto_ power conferred on\r\nhim by the State constitution, and their legislative action be defeated,\r\nand yet the assent of the legislative authority is implied, and the\r\ndirectors of this contemplated institution are authorized to establish a\r\nbranch or branches in such State whenever they may find it conducive to\r\nthe interest of the stockholders to do so; and having once established\r\nit they can under no circumstances withdraw it except by act of\r\nCongress. The State may afterwards protest against such unjust\r\ninference, but its authority is gone. Its assent is implied by its\r\nfailure or inability to act at its first session, and its voice can\r\nnever afterwards be heard. To inferences so violent and, as they seem to\r\nme, irrational I can not yield my consent. No court of justice would\r\nor could sanction them without reversing all that is established in\r\njudicial proceeding by introducing presumptions at variance with fact\r\nand inferences at the expense of reason. A State in a condition of\r\nduress would be _presumed_ to speak as an individual manacled and in\r\nprison might be presumed to be in the enjoyment of freedom. Far better\r\nto say to the States boldly and frankly, Congress wills and submission\r\nis demanded.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the directors may not establish branches under such\r\ncircumstances; but this is a question of power, and this bill invests\r\nthem with full authority to do so. If the legislature of New York or\r\nPennsylvania or any other State should be found to be in such condition\r\nas I have supposed, could there be any security furnished against such a\r\nstep on the part of the directors? Nay, is it not fairly to be presumed\r\nthat this proviso was introduced for the sole purpose of meeting the\r\ncontingency referred to? Why else should it have been introduced? And\r\nI submit to the Senate whether it can be believed that any State would\r\nbe likely to sit quietly down under such a state of things. In a great\r\nmeasure of public interest their patriotism may be successfully appealed\r\nto, but to infer their assent from circumstances at war with such\r\ninference I can not but regard as calculated to excite a feeling at\r\nfatal enmity with the peace and harmony of the country. I must therefore\r\nregard this clause as asserting the power to be in Congress to establish\r\noffices of discount in a State not only without its assent, but against\r\nits dissent, and so regarding it I can not sanction it. On general\r\nprinciples the right in Congress to prescribe terms to any State implies\r\na superiority of power and control, deprives the transaction of all\r\npretense to compact between them, and terminates, as we have seen, in\r\nthe total abrogation of freedom of action on the part of the States.\r\nBut, further, the State may express, after the most solemn form of\r\nlegislation, its dissent, which may from time to time thereafter be\r\nrepeated in full view of its own interest, which can never be separated\r\nfrom the wise and beneficent operation of this Government, and yet\r\nCongress may by virtue of the last proviso overrule its law, and upon\r\ngrounds which to such State will appear to rest on a constructive\r\nnecessity and propriety and nothing more. I regard the bill as asserting\r\nfor Congress the right to incorporate a United States bank with power\r\nand right to establish offices of discount and deposit in the several\r\nStates of this Union with or without their consent--a principle to which\r\nI have always heretofore been opposed and which can never obtain my\r\nsanction; and waiving all other considerations growing out of its other\r\nprovisions, I return it to the House in which it originated with these\r\nmy objections to its approval.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _September 9, 1841_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIt is with extreme regret that I feel myself constrained by the duty\r\nfaithfully to execute the office of President of the United States\r\nand to the best of my ability to \"preserve, protect, and defend the\r\nConstitution of the United States\" to return to the House in which it\r\noriginated the bill \"to provide for the better collection, safe-keeping,\r\nand disbursement of the public revenue by means of a corporation to be\r\nstyled the Fiscal Corporation of the United States,\" with my written\r\nobjections.\r\n\r\nIn my message sent to the Senate on the 16th day of August last,\r\nreturning the bill \"to incorporate the subscribers to the Fiscal Bank\r\nof the United States,\" I distinctly declared that my own opinion had\r\nbeen uniformly proclaimed to be against the exercise \"of the power of\r\nCongress to create a national bank to operate _per se_ over the Union,\"\r\nand, entertaining that opinion, my main objection to that bill was based\r\nupon the highest moral and religious obligations of conscience and the\r\nConstitution. I readily admit that whilst the qualified _veto_ with\r\nwhich the Chief Magistrate is invested should be regarded and was\r\nintended by the wise men who made it a part of the Constitution as a\r\ngreat conservative principle of our system, without the exercise of\r\nwhich on important occasions a mere representative majority might urge\r\nthe Government in its legislation beyond the limits fixed by its framers\r\nor might exert its just powers too hastily or oppressively, yet it is\r\na power which ought to be most cautiously exerted, and perhaps never\r\nexcept in a case eminently involving the public interest or one in which\r\nthe oath of the President, acting under his convictions, both mental\r\nand moral, imperiously requires its exercise. In such a case he has no\r\nalternative. He must either exert the negative power intrusted to him\r\nby the Constitution chiefly for its own preservation, protection, and\r\ndefense or commit an act of gross moral turpitude. Mere regard to the\r\nwill of a majority must not in a constitutional republic like ours\r\ncontrol this sacred and solemn duty of a sworn officer. The Constitution\r\nitself I regard and cherish as the embodied and written will of the\r\nwhole people of the United States. It is their fixed and fundamental\r\nlaw, which they unanimously prescribe to the public functionaries, their\r\nmere trustees and servants. This _their_ will and the law which _they_\r\nhave given us as the rule of our action have no guard, no guaranty of\r\npreservation, protection, and defense, but the oaths which it prescribes\r\nto the public officers, the sanctity with which they shall religiously\r\nobserve those oaths, and the patriotism with which the people shall\r\nshield it by their own sovereign will, which has made the Constitution\r\nsupreme. It must be exerted against the will of a mere representative\r\nmajority or not at all. It is alone in pursuance of that will that any\r\nmeasure can reach the President, and to say that because a majority\r\nin Congress have passed a bill he should therefore sanction it is\r\nto abrogate the power altogether and to render its insertion in the\r\nConstitution a work of absolute supererogation. The duty is to guard the\r\nfundamental will of the people themselves from (in this case; I admit,\r\nunintentional) change or infraction by a majority in Congress; and in\r\nthat light alone do I regard the constitutional duty which I now most\r\nreluctantly discharge. Is this bill now presented for my approval or\r\ndisapproval such a bill as I have already declared could not receive my\r\nsanction? Is it such a bill as calls for the exercise of the negative\r\npower under the Constitution? Does it violate the Constitution by\r\ncreating a national bank to operate _per se_ over the Union? Its title,\r\nin the first place, describes its general character. It is \"an act to\r\nprovide for the better collection, safe-keeping, and disbursement of the\r\n_public_ revenue by means of a _corporation_ to be styled the _Fiscal\r\nCorporation_ of the _United States_.\" In style, then, it is plainly\r\nnational in its character. Its powers, functions, and duties are those\r\nwhich pertain to the _collecting, keeping_, and _disbursing_ the\r\n_public_ revenue. The means by which these are to be exerted is a\r\n_corporation_ to be styled the _Fiscal_ Corporation of the United\r\nStates. It is a corporation created by the Congress of the United\r\nStates, in its character of a national legislature for the whole\r\nUnion, to perform the _fiscal_ purposes, meet the _fiscal_ wants and\r\nexigencies, supply the _fiscal_ uses, and exert the _fiscal_ agencies\r\nof the Treasury of the United States. Such is its own description of\r\nitself. Do its provisions contradict its title? They do not. It is true\r\nthat by its first section it provides that it shall be established in\r\nthe District of Columbia; but the amount of its capital, the manner\r\nin which its stock is to be subscribed for and held, the persons and\r\nbodies, corporate and politic, by whom its stock may be held, the\r\nappointment of its directors and their powers and duties, its\r\nfundamental articles, especially that to establish agencies in any part\r\nof the Union, the corporate powers and business of such agencies, the\r\nprohibition of Congress to establish any other corporation with similar\r\npowers for twenty years, with express reservation in the same clause\r\nto modify or create any bank for the District of Columbia, so that the\r\naggregate capital shall not exceed five millions, without enumerating\r\nother features which are equally distinctive and characteristic, clearly\r\nshow that it can not be regarded as other than a bank of the United\r\nStates, with powers seemingly more limited than have heretofore been\r\ngranted to such an institution. It operates _per se_ over the Union by\r\nvirtue of the unaided and, in my view, assumed authority of Congress\r\nas a national legislature, as distinguishable from a bank created by\r\nCongress for the District of Columbia as the local legislature of the\r\nDistrict. Every United States bank heretofore created has had power to\r\ndeal in bills of exchange as well as local discounts. Both were trading\r\nprivileges conferred, and both were exercised by virtue of the aforesaid\r\npower of Congress over the whole Union. The question of power remains\r\nunchanged without reference to the extent of privilege granted. If this\r\nproposed corporation is to be regarded as a local bank of the District\r\nof Columbia, invested by Congress with general powers to operate over\r\nthe Union, it is obnoxious to still stronger objections. It assumes that\r\nCongress may invest a local institution with general or national powers.\r\nWith the same propriety that it may do this in regard to a bank of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia it may as to a State bank. Yet who can indulge the\r\nidea that this Government can rightfully, by making a State bank its\r\nfiscal agent, invest it with the absolute and unqualified powers\r\nconferred by this bill? When I come to look at the details of the bill,\r\nthey do not recommend it strongly to my adoption. A brief notice of some\r\nof its provisions will suffice.\r\n\r\nFirst. It may justify substantially a system of discounts of the most\r\nobjectionable character. It is to deal in bills of exchange drawn in one\r\nState and payable in another without any restraint. The bill of exchange\r\nmay have an unlimited time to run, and its renewability is nowhere\r\nguarded against. It may, in fact, assume the most objectionable form of\r\naccommodation paper. It is not required to rest on any actual, real, or\r\nsubstantial exchange basis. A drawer in one place becomes the accepter\r\nin another, and so in turn the accepter may become the drawer upon a\r\nmutual understanding. It may at the same time indulge in mere local\r\ndiscounts under the name of bills of exchange. A bill drawn at\r\nPhiladelphia on Camden, N.J., at New York on a border town in New\r\nJersey, at Cincinnati on Newport, in Kentucky, not to multiply other\r\nexamples, might, for anything in this bill to restrain it, become a mere\r\nmatter of local accommodation. Cities thus relatively situated would\r\npossess advantages over cities otherwise situated of so decided a\r\ncharacter as most justly to excite dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nSecond. There is no limit prescribed to the premium in the purchase\r\nof bills of exchange, thereby correcting none of the evils under which\r\nthe community now labors, and operating most injuriously upon the\r\nagricultural States, in which the irregularities in the rates of\r\nexchange are most severely felt. Nor are these the only consequences.\r\nA resumption of specie payments by the banks of those States would be\r\nliable to indefinite postponement; for as the operation of the agencies\r\nof the interior would chiefly consist in selling bills of exchange, and\r\nthe purchases could only be made in specie or the notes of banks paying\r\nspecie, the State banks would either have to continue with their doors\r\nclosed or exist at the mercy of this national monopoly of brokerage.\r\nNor can it be passed over without remark that whilst the District of\r\nColumbia is made the seat of the principal bank, its citizens are\r\nexcluded from all participation in any benefit it might afford by\r\na positive prohibition on the bank from all discounting within the\r\nDistrict.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the objections which prominently exist against the\r\ndetails of the bill. Others might be urged of much force, but it would\r\nbe unprofitable to dwell upon them. Suffice it to add that this charter\r\nis designed to continue for twenty years without a competitor; that the\r\ndefects to which I have alluded, being founded on the fundamental law of\r\nthe corporation, are irrevocable, and that if the objections be well\r\nfounded it would be overhazardous to pass the bill into a law.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I take leave most respectfully to say that I have felt the\r\nmost anxious solicitude to meet the wishes of Congress in the adoption\r\nof a fiscal agent which, avoiding all constitutional objections, should\r\nharmonize conflicting opinions. Actuated by this feeling, I have been\r\nready to yield much in a spirit of conciliation to the opinions of\r\nothers; and it is with great pain that I now feel compelled to differ\r\nfrom Congress a second time in the same session. At the commencement of\r\nthis session, inclined from choice to defer to the legislative will, I\r\nsubmitted to Congress the propriety of adopting a fiscal agent which,\r\nwithout violating the Constitution, would separate the public money from\r\nthe Executive control and perform the operations of the Treasury without\r\nbeing burdensome to the people or inconvenient or expensive to the\r\nGovernment. It is deeply to be regretted that this department of the\r\nGovernment can not upon constitutional and other grounds concur with the\r\nlegislative department in this last measure proposed to attain these\r\ndesirable objects. Owing to the brief space between the period of the\r\ndeath of my lamented predecessor and my own installation into office,\r\nI was, in fact, not left time to prepare and submit a definitive\r\nrecommendation of my own in my regular message, and since my mind has\r\nbeen wholly occupied in a most anxious attempt to conform my action\r\nto the legislative will. In this communication I am confined by the\r\nConstitution to my objections simply to this bill, but the period of the\r\nregular session will soon arrive, when it will be my duty, under another\r\nclause of the Constitution, \"to give to Congress information of the\r\nstate of the Union and recommend to their consideration such measures\r\nas\" I \"shall judge necessary and expedient.\" And I most respectfully\r\nsubmit, in a spirit of harmony, whether the present differences of\r\nopinion should be pressed further at this time, and whether the\r\npeculiarity of my situation does not entitle me to a postponement of\r\nthis subject to a more auspicious period for deliberation. The two\r\nHouses of Congress have distinguished themselves at this extraordinary\r\nsession by the performance of an immense mass of labor at a season very\r\nunfavorable both to health and action, and have passed many laws which\r\nI trust will prove highly beneficial to the interests of the country\r\nand fully answer its just expectations. It has been my good fortune\r\nand pleasure to concur with them in all measures except this. And why\r\nshould our difference on this alone be pushed to extremes? It is my\r\nanxious desire that it should not be. I too have been burdened with\r\nextraordinary labors of late, and I sincerely desire time for deep\r\nand deliberate reflection on this the greatest difficulty of my\r\nAdministration. May we not now pause until a more favorable time, when,\r\nwith the most anxious hope that the Executive and Congress may cordially\r\nunite, some measure of finance may be deliberately adopted promotive of\r\nthe good of our common country?\r\n\r\nI will take this occasion to declare that the conclusions to which\r\nI have brought myself are those of a settled conviction, founded, in\r\nmy opinion, on a just view of the Constitution; that in arriving at it\r\nI have been actuated by no other motive or desire than to uphold the\r\ninstitutions of the country as they have come down to us from the hands\r\nof our godlike ancestors, and that I shall esteem my efforts to sustain\r\nthem, even though I perish, more honorable than to win the applause of\r\nmen by a sacrifice of my duty and my conscience.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Statutes at Large (Little, Brown & Co.), Vol. XI, p. 786.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas it has come to the knowledge of the Government of the United\r\nStates that sundry secret lodges, clubs, or associations exist on the\r\nnorthern frontier; that the members of these lodges are bound together\r\nby secret oaths; that they have collected firearms and other military\r\nmaterials and secreted them in sundry places; and that it is their\r\npurpose to violate the laws of their country by making military and\r\nlawless incursions, when opportunity shall offer, into the territories\r\nof a power with which the United States are at peace; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is known that traveling agitators, from both sides of the\r\nline, visit these lodges and harangue the members in secret meeting,\r\nstimulating them to illegal acts; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the same persons are known to levy contributions on the ignorant\r\nand credulous for their own benefit, thus supporting and enriching\r\nthemselves by the basest means; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the unlawful intentions of the members of these lodges have\r\nalready been manifested in an attempt to destroy the lives and property\r\nof the inhabitants of Chippewa, in Canada, and the public property of\r\nthe British Government there being:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, John Tyler, President of the United States, do issue\r\nthis my proclamation, admonishing all such evil-minded persons of the\r\ncondign punishment which is certain to overtake them; assuring them that\r\nthe laws of the United States will be rigorously executed against their\r\nillegal acts, and that if in any lawless incursion into Canada they fall\r\ninto the hands of the British authorities they will not be reclaimed as\r\nAmerican citizens nor any interference made by this Government in their\r\nbehalf. And I exhort all well-meaning but deluded persons who may have\r\njoined these lodges immediately to abandon them and to have nothing more\r\nto do with their secret meetings or unlawful oaths, as they would avoid\r\nserious consequences to themselves. And I expect the intelligent and\r\nwell-disposed members of the community to frown on all these unlawful\r\ncombinations and illegal proceedings, and to assist the Government in\r\nmaintaining the peace of the country against the mischievous\r\nconsequences of the acts of these violators of the law.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand, at the city of Washington, the 25th day of\r\nSeptember, A.D. 1841, and of the Independence of the United States the\r\nsixty-sixth.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  DANIEL WEBSTER,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\nADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, July 5, 1841_.\r\n\r\nBrevet Major-General Winfield Scott having been appointed by the\r\nPresident, by and with the consent and advice of the Senate, the\r\nMajor-general of the Army of the United States, he is directed to assume\r\nthe command and enter upon his duties accordingly.\r\n\r\nBy command of the President of the United States:\r\n\r\nR. JONES,\r\n  _Adjutant-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 7, 1841_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn coming together, fellow-citizens, to enter again upon the discharge\r\nof the duties with which the people have charged us severally, we find\r\ngreat occasion to rejoice in the general prosperity of the country.\r\nWe are in the enjoyment of all the blessings of civil and religious\r\nliberty, with unexampled means of education, knowledge, and improvement.\r\nThrough the year which is now drawing to a close peace has been in our\r\nborders and plenty in our habitations, and although disease has visited\r\nsome few portions of the land with distress and mortality, yet in\r\ngeneral the health of the people has been preserved, and we are all\r\ncalled upon by the highest obligations of duty to renew our thanks and\r\nour devotion to our Heavenly Parent, who has continued to vouchsafe to\r\nus the eminent blessings which surround us and who has so signally\r\ncrowned the year with His goodness. If we find ourselves increasing\r\nbeyond example in numbers, in strength, in wealth, in knowledge, in\r\neverything which promotes human and social happiness, let us ever\r\nremember our dependence for all these on the protection and merciful\r\ndispensations of Divine Providence.\r\n\r\nSince your last adjournment Alexander McLeod, a British subject who was\r\nindicted for the murder of an American citizen, and whose case has been\r\nthe subject of a correspondence heretofore communicated to you, has been\r\nacquitted by the verdict of an impartial and intelligent jury, and has\r\nunder the judgment of the court been regularly discharged.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain having made known to this Government that the expedition\r\nwhich was fitted out from Canada for the destruction of the steamboat\r\n_Caroline_ in the winter of 1837, and which resulted in the destruction\r\nof said boat and in the death of an American citizen, was undertaken\r\nby orders emanating from the authorities of the British Government in\r\nCanada, and demanding the discharge of McLeod upon the ground that\r\nif engaged in that expedition he did but fulfill the orders of his\r\nGovernment, has thus been answered in the only way in which she could be\r\nanswered by a government the powers of which are distributed among its\r\nseveral departments by the fundamental law. Happily for the people of\r\nGreat Britain, as well as those of the United States, the only mode by\r\nwhich an individual arraigned for a criminal offense before the courts\r\nof either can obtain his discharge is by the independent action of the\r\njudiciary and by proceedings equally familiar to the courts of both\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nIf in Great Britain a power exists in the Crown to cause to be entered a\r\n_nolle prosequi_, which is not the case with the Executive power of the\r\nUnited States upon a prosecution pending in a State court, yet _there_\r\nno more than _here_ can the chief executive power rescue a prisoner from\r\ncustody without an order of the proper tribunal directing his discharge.\r\nThe precise stage of the proceedings at which such order may be made is\r\na matter of municipal regulation exclusively, and not to be complained\r\nof by any other government. In cases of this kind a government becomes\r\npolitically responsible only when its tribunals of last resort are shown\r\nto have rendered unjust and injurious judgments in matters not doubtful.\r\nTo the establishment and elucidation of this principle no nation has\r\nlent its authority more efficiently than Great Britain. Alexander\r\nMcLeod, having his option either to prosecute a writ of error from the\r\ndecision of the supreme court of New York, which had been rendered upon\r\nhis application for a discharge, to the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates, or to submit his case to the decision of a jury, preferred the\r\nlatter, deeming it the readiest mode of obtaining his liberation; and\r\nthe result has fully sustained the wisdom of his choice. The manner in\r\nwhich the issue submitted was tried will satisfy the English Government\r\nthat the principles of justice will never fail to govern the enlightened\r\ndecision of an American tribunal. I can not fail, however, to suggest to\r\nCongress the propriety, and in some degree the necessity, of making such\r\nprovisions by law, so far as they may constitutionally do so, for the\r\nremoval at their commencement and at the option of the party of all\r\nsuch cases as may hereafter arise, and which may involve the faithful\r\nobservance and execution of our international obligations, from the\r\nState to the Federal judiciary. This Government, by our institutions, is\r\ncharged with the maintenance of peace and the preservation of amicable\r\nrelations with the nations of the earth, and ought to possess without\r\nquestion all the reasonable and proper means of maintaining the one and\r\npreserving the other. While just confidence is felt in the judiciary of\r\nthe States, yet this Government ought to be competent in itself for the\r\nfulfillment of the high duties which have been devolved upon it under\r\nthe organic law by the States themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the month of September a party of armed men from Upper Canada invaded\r\nthe territory of the United States and forcibly seized upon the person\r\nof one Grogan, and under circumstances of great harshness hurriedly\r\ncarried him beyond the limits of the United States and delivered him up\r\nto the authorities of Upper Canada. His immediate discharge was ordered\r\nby those authorities upon the facts of the case being brought to their\r\nknowledge--a course of procedure which was to have been expected from\r\na nation with whom we are at peace, and which was not more due to the\r\nrights of the United States than to its own regard for justice. The\r\ncorrespondence which passed between the Department of State and the\r\nBritish envoy, Mr. Fox, and with the governor of Vermont, as soon as the\r\nfacts had been made known to this department, are herewith communicated.\r\n\r\nI regret that it is not in my power to make known to you an equally\r\nsatisfactory conclusion in the case of the _Caroline_ steamer, with the\r\ncircumstances connected with the destruction of which, in December,\r\n1837, by an armed force fitted out in the Province of Upper Canada, you\r\nare already made acquainted. No such atonement as was due for the public\r\nwrong done to the United States by this invasion of her territory, so\r\nwholly irreconcilable with her rights as an independent power, has yet\r\nbeen made. In the view taken by this Government the inquiry whether\r\nthe vessel was in the employment of those who were prosecuting an\r\nunauthorized war against that Province or was engaged by the owner in\r\nthe business of transporting passengers to and from Navy Island in hopes\r\nof private gain, which was most probably the case, in no degree alters\r\nthe real question at issue between the two Governments. This Government\r\ncan never concede to any foreign government the power, except in a case\r\nof the most urgent and extreme necessity, of invading its territory,\r\neither to arrest the persons or destroy the property of those who may\r\nhave violated the municipal laws of such foreign government or have\r\ndisregarded their obligations arising under the law of nations. The\r\nterritory of the United States must be regarded as sacredly secure\r\nagainst all such invasions until they shall voluntarily acknowledge\r\ntheir inability to acquit themselves of their duties to others. And in\r\nannouncing this sentiment I do but affirm a principle which no nation on\r\nearth would be more ready to vindicate at all hazards than the people\r\nand Government of Great Britain. If upon a full investigation of all the\r\nfacts it shall appear that the owner of the _Caroline_ was governed by\r\na hostile intent or had made common cause with those who were in the\r\noccupancy of Navy Island, then so far as he is concerned there can be no\r\nclaim to indemnity for the destruction of his boat which this Government\r\nwould feel itself bound to prosecute, since he would have acted not only\r\nin derogation of the rights of Great Britain, but in clear violation of\r\nthe laws of the United States; but that is a question which, however\r\nsettled, in no manner involves the higher consideration of the violation\r\nof territorial sovereignty and jurisdiction. To recognize it as an\r\nadmissible practice that each Government in its turn, upon any sudden\r\nand unauthorized outbreak which, on a frontier the extent of which\r\nrenders it impossible for either to have an efficient force on every\r\nmile of it, and which outbreak, therefore, neither may be able to\r\nsuppress in a day, may take vengeance into its own hands, and without\r\neven a remonstrance, and in the absence of any pressing or overruling\r\nnecessity may invade the territory of the other, would inevitably lead\r\nto results equally to be deplored by both. When border collisions come\r\nto receive the sanction or to be made on the authority of either\r\nGovernment general war must be the inevitable result. While it is the\r\nardent desire of the United States to cultivate the relations of peace\r\nwith all nations and to fulfill all the duties of good neighborhood\r\ntoward those who possess territories adjoining their own, that very\r\ndesire would lead them to deny the right of any foreign power to invade\r\ntheir boundary with an armed force. The correspondence between the two\r\nGovernments on this subject will at a future day of your session be\r\nsubmitted to your consideration; and in the meantime I can not but\r\nindulge the hope that the British Government will see the propriety of\r\nrenouncing as a rule of future action the precedent which has been set\r\nin the affair at Schlosser.\r\n\r\nI herewith submit the correspondence which has recently taken place\r\nbetween the American minister at the Court of St. James, Mr. Stevenson,\r\nand the minister of foreign affairs of that Government on the right\r\nclaimed by that Government to visit and detain vessels sailing under\r\nthe American flag and engaged in prosecuting lawful commerce in the\r\nAfrican seas. Our commercial interests in that region have experienced\r\nconsiderable increase and have become an object of much importance, and\r\nit is the duty of this Government to protect them against all improper\r\nand vexatious interruption. However desirous the United States may\r\nbe for the suppression of the slave trade, they can not consent to\r\ninterpolations into the maritime code at the mere will and pleasure of\r\nother governments. We deny the right of any such interpolation to any\r\none or all the nations of the earth without our consent. We claim to\r\nhave a voice in all amendments or alterations of that code, and when we\r\nare given to understand, as in this instance, by a foreign government\r\nthat its treaties with other nations can not be executed without the\r\nestablishment and enforcement of new principles of maritime police, to\r\nbe applied without our consent, we must employ a language neither of\r\nequivocal import or susceptible of misconstruction. American citizens\r\nprosecuting a lawful commerce in the African seas under the flag of\r\ntheir country are not responsible for the abuse or unlawful use of that\r\nflag by others; nor can they rightfully on account of any such alleged\r\nabuses be interrupted, molested, or detained while on the ocean, and if\r\nthus molested and detained while pursuing honest voyages in the usual\r\nway and violating no law themselves they are unquestionably entitled to\r\nindemnity. This Government has manifested its repugnance to the slave\r\ntrade in a manner which can not be misunderstood. By its fundamental law\r\nit prescribed limits in point of time to its continuance, and against\r\nits own citizens who might so far forget the rights of humanity as to\r\nengage in that wicked traffic it has long since by its municipal laws\r\ndenounced the most condign punishment. Many of the States composing this\r\nUnion had made appeals to the civilized world for its suppression long\r\nbefore the moral sense of other nations had become shocked by the\r\niniquities of the traffic. Whether this Government should now enter into\r\ntreaties containing mutual stipulations upon this subject is a question\r\nfor its mature deliberation. Certain it is that if the right to detain\r\nAmerican ships on the high seas can be justified on the plea of a\r\nnecessity for such detention arising out of the existence of treaties\r\nbetween other nations, the same plea may be extended and enlarged by the\r\nnew stipulations of new treaties to which the United States may not be a\r\nparty. This Government will not cease to urge upon that of Great Britain\r\nfull and ample remuneration for all losses, whether arising from\r\ndetention or otherwise, to which American citizens have heretofore been\r\nor may hereafter be subjected by the exercise of rights which this\r\nGovernment can not recognize as legitimate and proper. Nor will I\r\nindulge a doubt but that the sense of justice of Great Britain will\r\nconstrain her to make retribution for any wrong or loss which any\r\nAmerican citizen engaged in the prosecution of lawful commerce may have\r\nexperienced at the hands of her cruisers or other public authorities.\r\nThis Government, at the same time, will relax no effort to prevent its\r\ncitizens, if there be any so disposed, from prosecuting a traffic so\r\nrevolting to the feelings of humanity. It seeks to do no more than to\r\nprotect the fair and honest trader from molestation and injury; but\r\nwhile the enterprising mariner engaged in the pursuit of an honorable\r\ntrade is entitled to its protection, it will visit with condign\r\npunishment others of an opposite character.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to existing laws for the suppression of the\r\nAfrican slave trade, and recommend all such alterations as may give\r\nto them greater force and efficacy. That the American flag is grossly\r\nabused by the abandoned and profligate of other nations is but too\r\nprobable. Congress has not long since had this subject under its\r\nconsideration, and its importance well justifies renewed and anxious\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nI also communicate herewith the copy of a correspondence between Mr.\r\nStevenson and Lord Palmerston upon the subject, so interesting to\r\nseveral of the Southern States, of the rice duties, which resulted\r\nhonorably to the justice of Great Britain and advantageously to the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the last annual session the President informed\r\nCongress of the progress which had then been made in negotiating a\r\nconvention between this Government and that of England with a view\r\nto the final settlement of the question of the boundary between the\r\nterritorial limits of the two countries. I regret to say that little\r\nfurther advancement of the object has been accomplished since last year,\r\nbut this is owing to circumstances no way indicative of any abatement of\r\nthe desire of both parties to hasten the negotiation to its conclusion\r\nand to settle the question in dispute as early as possible. In the\r\ncourse of the session it is my hope to be able to announce some further\r\ndegree of progress toward the accomplishment of this highly desirable\r\nend.\r\n\r\nThe commission appointed by this Government for the exploration and\r\nsurvey of the line of boundary separating the States of Maine and New\r\nHampshire from the conterminous British Provinces is, it is believed,\r\nabout to close its field labors and is expected soon to report the\r\nresults of its examinations to the Department of State. The report,\r\nwhen received, will be laid before Congress.\r\n\r\nThe failure on the part of Spain to pay with punctuality the interest\r\ndue under the convention of 1834 for the settlement of claims between\r\nthe two countries has made it the duty of the Executive to call the\r\nparticular attention of that Government to the subject. A disposition\r\nhas been manifested by it, which is believed to be entirely sincere,\r\nto fulfill its obligations in this respect so soon as its internal\r\ncondition and the state of its finances will permit. An arrangement is\r\nin progress from the result of which it is trusted that those of our\r\ncitizens who have claims under the convention will at no distant day\r\nreceive the stipulated payments.\r\n\r\nA treaty of commerce and navigation with Belgium was concluded and\r\nsigned at Washington on the 29th of March, 1840, and was duly sanctioned\r\nby the Senate of the United States. The treaty was ratified by His\r\nBelgian Majesty, but did not receive the approbation of the Belgian\r\nChambers within the time limited by its terms, and has therefore become\r\nvoid.\r\n\r\nThis occurrence assumes the graver aspect from the consideration that in\r\n1833 a treaty negotiated between the two Governments and ratified on the\r\npart of the United States failed to be ratified on the part of Belgium.\r\nThe representative of that Government at Washington informs the\r\nDepartment of State that he has been instructed to give explanations of\r\nthe causes which occasioned delay in the approval of the late treaty by\r\nthe legislature, and to express the regret of the King at the\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nThe joint commission under the convention with Texas to ascertain the\r\ntrue boundary between the two countries has concluded its labors, but\r\nthe final report of the commissioner of the United States has not been\r\nreceived. It is understood, however, that the meridian line as traced\r\nby the commission lies somewhat farther east than the position hitherto\r\ngenerally assigned to it, and consequently includes in Texas some part\r\nof the territory which had been considered as belonging to the States\r\nof Louisiana and Arkansas.\r\n\r\nThe United States can not but take a deep interest in whatever relates\r\nto this young but growing Republic. Settled principally by emigrants\r\nfrom the United States, we have the happiness to know that the great\r\nprinciples of civil liberty are there destined to flourish under wise\r\ninstitutions and wholesome laws, and that through its example another\r\nevidence is to be afforded of the capacity of popular institutions to\r\nadvance the prosperity, happiness, and permanent glory of the human\r\nrace. The great truth that government was made for the people and not\r\nthe people for government has already been established in the practice\r\nand by the example of these United States, and we can do no other than\r\ncontemplate its further exemplification by a sister republic with the\r\ndeepest interest.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the independent States of this hemisphere, formerly\r\nunder the dominion of Spain, have not undergone any material change\r\nwithin the past year. The incessant sanguinary conflicts in or between\r\nthose countries are to be greatly deplored as necessarily tending to\r\ndisable them from performing their duty as members of the community\r\nof nations and rising to the destiny which the position and natural\r\nresources of many of them might lead them justly to anticipate, as\r\nconstantly giving occasion also, directly or indirectly, for complaints\r\non the part of our citizens who resort thither for purposes of\r\ncommercial intercourse, and as retarding reparation for wrongs already\r\ncommitted, some of which are by no means of recent date.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the Congress of Ecuador to hold a session at the time\r\nappointed for that purpose, in January last, will probably render\r\nabortive a treaty of commerce with that Republic, which was signed at\r\nQuito on the 13th of June, 1839, and had been duly ratified on our\r\npart, but which required the approbation of that body prior to its\r\nratification by the Ecuadorian Executive.\r\n\r\nA convention which has been concluded with the Republic of Peru,\r\nproviding for the settlement of certain claims of citizens of the United\r\nStates upon the Government of that Republic, will be duly submitted to\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nThe claims of our citizens against the Brazilian Government originating\r\nfrom captures and other causes are still unsatisfied. The United States\r\nhave, however, so uniformly shown a disposition to cultivate relations\r\nof amity with that Empire that it is hoped the unequivocal tokens of the\r\nsame spirit toward us which an adjustment of the affairs referred to\r\nwould afford will be given without further avoidable delay.\r\n\r\nThe war with the Indian tribes on the peninsula of Florida has during\r\nthe last summer and fall been prosecuted with untiring activity and\r\nzeal. A summer campaign was resolved upon as the best mode of bringing\r\nit to a close. Our brave officers and men who have been engaged in that\r\nservice have suffered toils and privations and exhibited an energy which\r\nin any other war would have won for them unfading laurels. In despite\r\nof the sickness incident to the climate, they have penetrated the\r\nfastnesses of the Indians, broken up their encampments, and harassed\r\nthem unceasingly. Numbers have been captured, and still greater numbers\r\nhave surrendered and have been transported to join their brethren on the\r\nlands elsewhere allotted to them by the Government, and a strong hope is\r\nentertained that under the conduct of the gallant officer at the head of\r\nthe troops in Florida that troublesome and expensive war is destined to\r\na speedy termination. With all the other Indian tribes we are enjoying\r\nthe blessings of peace. Our duty as well as our best interests prompts\r\nus to observe in all our intercourse with them fidelity in fulfilling\r\nour engagements, the practice of strict justice, as well as the constant\r\nexercise of acts of benevolence and kindness. These are the great\r\ninstruments of civilization, and through the use of them alone can the\r\nuntutored child of the forest be induced to listen to its teachings.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State, on whom the acts of Congress have devolved the\r\nduty of directing the proceedings for the taking of the sixth census or\r\nenumeration of the inhabitants of the United States, will report to the\r\ntwo Houses the progress of that work. The enumeration of persons has\r\nbeen completed, and exhibits a grand total of 17,069,453, making an\r\nincrease over the census of 1830 of 4,202,646 inhabitants, and showing\r\na gain in a ratio exceeding 32-1/2 per cent for the last ten years.\r\n\r\nFrom the report of the Secretary of the Treasury you will be informed of\r\nthe condition of the finances. The balance in the Treasury on the 1st of\r\nJanuary last, as stated in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nsubmitted to Congress at the extra session, was $987,345.03. The\r\nreceipts into the Treasury during the first three quarters of this year\r\nfrom all sources amount to $23,467,072.52; the estimated receipts for\r\nthe fourth quarter amount to $6,943,095.25, amounting to $30,410,167.77,\r\nand making with the balance in the Treasury on the 1st of January last\r\n$31,397,512.80. The expenditures for the first three quarters of this\r\nyear amount to $24,734,346.97. The expenditures for the fourth quarter\r\nas estimated will amount to $7,290,723.73, thus making a total of\r\n$32,025,070.70, and leaving a deficit to be provided for on the 1st of\r\nJanuary next of about $627,557.90.\r\n\r\nOf the loan of $12,000,000 which was authorized by Congress at its late\r\nsession only $5,432,726.88 have been negotiated. The shortness of time\r\nwhich it had to run has presented no inconsiderable impediment in the\r\nway of its being taken by capitalists at home, while the same cause\r\nwould have operated with much greater force in the foreign market. For\r\nthat reason the foreign market has not been resorted to; and it is now\r\nsubmitted whether it would not be advisable to amend the law by making\r\nwhat remains undisposed of payable at a more distant day.\r\n\r\nShould it be necessary, in any view that Congress may take of the\r\nsubject, to revise the existing tariff of duties, I beg leave to say\r\nthat in the performance of that most delicate operation moderate\r\ncounsels would seem to be the wisest. The Government under which it is\r\nour happiness to live owes its existence to the spirit of compromise\r\nwhich prevailed among its framers; jarring and discordant opinions could\r\nonly have been reconciled by that noble spirit of patriotism which\r\nprompted conciliation and resulted in harmony. In the same spirit the\r\ncompromise bill, as it is commonly called, was adopted at the session of\r\n1833. While the people of no portion of the Union will ever hesitate to\r\npay all necessary taxes for the support of Government, yet an innate\r\nrepugnance exists to the imposition of burthens not really necessary for\r\nthat object. In imposing duties, however, for the purposes of revenue\r\na right to discriminate as to the articles on which the duty shall be\r\nlaid, as well as the amount, necessarily and most properly exists;\r\notherwise the Government would be placed in the condition of having to\r\nlevy the same duties upon all articles, the productive as well as the\r\nunproductive. The slightest duty upon some might have the effect of\r\ncausing their importation to cease, whereas others, entering extensively\r\ninto the consumption of the country, might bear the heaviest without any\r\nsensible diminution in the amount imported. So also the Government may\r\nbe justified in so discriminating by reference to other considerations\r\nof domestic policy connected with our manufactures. So long as the\r\nduties shall be laid with distinct reference to the wants of the\r\nTreasury no well-founded objection can exist against them. It might\r\nbe esteemed desirable that no such augmentation of the taxes should\r\ntake place as would have the effect of annulling the land-proceeds\r\ndistribution act of the last session, which act is declared to be\r\ninoperative the moment the duties are increased beyond 20 per cent, the\r\nmaximum rate established by the compromise act. Some of the provisions\r\nof the compromise act, which will go into effect on the 30th day of June\r\nnext, may, however, be found exceedingly inconvenient in practice under\r\nany regulations that Congress may adopt. I refer more particularly to\r\nthat relating to the home valuation. A difference in value of the same\r\narticles to some extent will necessarily exist at different ports, but\r\nthat is altogether insignificant when compared with the conflicts in\r\nvaluation which are likely to arise from the differences of opinion\r\namong the numerous appraisers of merchandise. In many instances the\r\nestimates of value must be conjectural, and thus as many different rates\r\nof value may be established as there are appraisers. These differences\r\nin valuation may also be increased by the inclination which, without\r\nthe slightest imputation on their honesty, may arise on the part of the\r\nappraisers in favor of their respective ports of entry. I recommend this\r\nwhole subject to the consideration of Congress with a single additional\r\nremark. Certainty and permanency in any system of governmental policy\r\nare in all respects eminently desirable, but more particularly is this\r\ntrue in all that affects trade and commerce, the operations of which\r\ndepend much more on the certainty of their returns and calculations\r\nwhich embrace distant periods of time than on high bounties or duties,\r\nwhich are liable to constant fluctuations.\r\n\r\nAt your late session I invited your attention to the condition of\r\nthe currency and exchanges and urged the necessity of adopting such\r\nmeasures as were consistent with the constitutional competency of the\r\nGovernment in order to correct the unsoundness of the one and, as far as\r\npracticable, the inequalities of the other. No country can be in the\r\nenjoyment of its full measure of prosperity without the presence of\r\na medium of exchange approximating to uniformity of value. What is\r\nnecessary as between the different nations of the earth is also\r\nimportant as between the inhabitants of different parts of the same\r\ncountry. With the first the precious metals constitute the chief medium\r\nof circulation, and such also would be the case as to the last but for\r\ninventions comparatively modern, which have furnished in place of gold\r\nand silver a paper circulation. I do not propose to enter into a\r\ncomparative analysis of the merits of the two systems. Such belonged\r\nmore properly to the period of the introduction of the paper system. The\r\nspeculative philosopher might find inducements to prosecute the inquiry,\r\nbut his researches could only lead him to conclude that the paper system\r\nhad probably better never have been introduced and that society might\r\nhave been much happier without it. The practical statesman has a very\r\ndifferent task to perform. He has to look at things as they are, to take\r\nthem as he finds them, to supply deficiencies and to prune excesses as\r\nfar as in him lies. The task of furnishing a corrective for derangements\r\nof the paper medium with us is almost inexpressibly great. The power\r\nexerted by the States to charter banking corporations, and which, having\r\nbeen carried to a great excess, has filled the country with, in most of\r\nthe States, an irredeemable paper medium, is an evil which in some way\r\nor other requires a corrective. The rates at which bills of exchange\r\nare negotiated between different parts of the country furnish an index\r\nof the value of the local substitute for gold and silver, which is in\r\nmany parts so far depreciated as not to be received except at a large\r\ndiscount in payment of debts or in the purchase of produce. It could\r\nearnestly be desired that every bank not possessing the means of\r\nresumption should follow the example of the late United States Bank of\r\nPennsylvania and go into liquidation rather than by refusing to do so\r\nto continue embarrassments in the way of solvent institutions, thereby\r\naugmenting the difficulties incident to the present condition of things.\r\nWhether this Government, with due regard to the rights of the States,\r\nhas any power to constrain the banks either to resume specie payments\r\nor to force them into liquidation, is an inquiry which will not fail\r\nto claim your consideration. In view of the great advantages which are\r\nallowed the corporators, not among the least of which is the authority\r\ncontained in most of their charters to make loans to three times the\r\namount of their capital, thereby often deriving three times as much\r\ninterest on the same amount of money as any individual is permitted by\r\nlaw to receive, no sufficient apology can be urged for a long-continued\r\nsuspension of specie payments. Such suspension is productive of the\r\ngreatest detriment to the public by expelling from circulation the\r\nprecious metals and seriously hazarding the success of any effort that\r\nthis Government can make to increase commercial facilities and to\r\nadvance the public interests.\r\n\r\nThis is the more to be regretted and the indispensable necessity for\r\na sound currency becomes the more manifest when we reflect on the vast\r\namount of the internal commerce of the country. Of this we have no\r\nstatistics nor just data for forming adequate opinions. But there can\r\nbe no doubt but that the amount of transportation coastwise by sea, and\r\nthe transportation inland by railroads and canals, and by steamboats\r\nand other modes of conveyance over the surface of our vast rivers and\r\nimmense lakes, and the value of property carried and interchanged by\r\nthese means form a general aggregate to which the foreign commerce of\r\nthe country, large as it is, makes but a distant approach.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any controlling power over this subject, which, by\r\nforcing a general resumption of specie payments, would at once have the\r\neffect of restoring a sound medium of exchange and would leave to the\r\ncountry but little to desire, what measure of relief falling within the\r\nlimits of our constitutional competency does it become this Government\r\nto adopt? It was my painful duty at your last session, under the weight\r\nof most solemn obligations, to differ with Congress on the measures\r\nwhich it proposed for my approval, and which it doubtless regarded as\r\ncorrective of existing evils. Subsequent reflection and events since\r\noccurring have only served to confirm me in the opinions then\r\nentertained and frankly expressed. I must be permitted to add that no\r\nscheme of governmental policy unaided by individual exertions can be\r\navailable for ameliorating the present condition of things. Commercial\r\nmodes of exchange and a good currency are but the necessary means of\r\ncommerce and intercourse, not the direct productive sources of wealth.\r\nWealth can only be accumulated by the earnings of industry and the\r\nsavings of frugality, and nothing can be more ill judged than to look\r\nto facilities in borrowing or to a redundant circulation for the power\r\nof discharging pecuniary obligations. The country is full of resources\r\nand the people full of energy, and the great and permanent remedy\r\nfor present embarrassments must be sought in industry, economy, the\r\nobservance of good faith, and the favorable influence of time. In\r\npursuance of a pledge given to you in my last message to Congress, which\r\npledge I urge as an apology for adventuring to present you the details\r\nof any plan, the Secretary of the Treasury will be ready to submit to\r\nyou, should you require it, a plan of finance which, while it throws\r\naround the public treasure reasonable guards for its protection and\r\nrests on powers acknowledged in practice to exist from the origin of\r\nthe Government, will at the same time furnish to the country a sound\r\npaper medium and afford all reasonable facilities for regulating the\r\nexchanges. When submitted, you will perceive in it a plan amendatory of\r\nthe existing laws in relation to the Treasury Department, subordinate in\r\nall respects to the will of Congress directly and the will of the people\r\nindirectly, self-sustaining should it be found in practice to realize\r\nits promises in theory, and repealable at the pleasure of Congress. It\r\nproposes by effectual restraints and by invoking the true spirit of our\r\ninstitutions to separate the purse from the sword, or, more properly to\r\nspeak, denies any other control to the President over the agents who may\r\nbe selected to carry it into execution but what may be indispensably\r\nnecessary to secure the fidelity of such agents, and by wise regulations\r\nkeeps plainly apart from each other private and public funds. It\r\ncontemplates the establishment of a board of control at the seat of\r\ngovernment, with agencies at prominent commercial points or wherever\r\nelse Congress shall direct, for the safe-keeping and disbursement of the\r\npublic moneys, and a substitution at the option of the public creditor\r\nof Treasury notes in lieu of gold and silver. It proposes to limit the\r\nissues to an amount not to exceed $15,000,000 without the express\r\nsanction of the legislative power. It also authorizes the receipt of\r\nindividual deposits of gold and silver to a limited amount, and the\r\ngranting certificates of deposit divided into such sums as may be called\r\nfor by the depositors. It proceeds a step further and authorizes the\r\npurchase and sale of domestic bills and drafts resting on a real and\r\nsubstantial basis, payable at sight or having but a short time to run,\r\nand drawn on places not less than 100 miles apart, which authority,\r\nexcept in so far as may be necessary for Government purposes\r\nexclusively, is only to be exerted upon the express condition that its\r\nexercise shall not be prohibited by the State in which the agency is\r\nsituated. In order to cover the expenses incident to the plan, it will\r\nbe authorized to receive moderate premiums for certificates issued on\r\ndeposits and on bills bought and sold, and thus, as far as its dealings\r\nextend, to furnish facilities to commercial intercourse at the lowest\r\npossible rates and to subduct from the earnings of industry the least\r\npossible sum. It uses the State banks at a distance from the agencies\r\nas auxiliaries without imparting any power to trade in its name.\r\nIt is subjected to such guards and restraints as have appeared to be\r\nnecessary. It is the creature of law and exists only at the pleasure of\r\nthe Legislature. It is made to rest on an actual specie basis in order\r\nto redeem the notes at the places of issue, produces no dangerous\r\nredundancy of circulation, affords no temptation to speculation, is\r\nattended by no inflation of prices, is equable in its operation, makes\r\nthe Treasury notes (which it may use along with the certificates of\r\ndeposit and the notes of specie-paying banks) convertible at the place\r\nwhere collected, receivable in payment of Government dues, and without\r\nviolating any principle of the Constitution affords the Government and\r\nthe people such facilities as are called for by the wants of both. Such,\r\nit has appeared to me, are its recommendations, and in view of them it\r\nwill be submitted, whenever you may require it, to your consideration.\r\n\r\nI am not able to perceive that any fair and candid objection can be\r\nurged against the plan, the principal outlines of which I have thus\r\npresented. I can not doubt but that the notes which it proposes to\r\nfurnish at the voluntary option of the public creditor, issued in lieu\r\nof the revenue and its certificates of deposit, will be maintained\r\nat an equality with gold and silver everywhere. They are redeemable in\r\ngold and silver on demand at the places of issue. They are receivable\r\neverywhere in payment of Government dues. The Treasury notes are limited\r\nto an amount of one-fourth less than the estimated annual receipts of\r\nthe Treasury, and in addition they rest upon the faith of the Government\r\nfor their redemption. If all these assurances are not sufficient to make\r\nthem available, then the idea, as it seems to me, of furnishing a sound\r\npaper medium of exchange may be entirely abandoned.\r\n\r\nIf a fear be indulged that the Government may be tempted to run into\r\nexcess in its issues at any future day, it seems to me that no such\r\napprehension can reasonably be entertained until all confidence in the\r\nrepresentatives of the States and of the people, as well as of the\r\npeople themselves, shall be lost. The weightiest considerations of\r\npolicy require that the restraints now proposed to be thrown around the\r\nmeasure should not for light causes be removed. To argue against any\r\nproposed plan its liability to possible abuse is to reject every\r\nexpedient, since everything dependent on human action is liable\r\nto abuse. Fifteen millions of Treasury notes may be issued as the\r\n_maximum_, but a discretionary power is to be given to the board of\r\ncontrol under that sum, and every consideration will unite in leading\r\nthem to feel their way with caution. For the first eight years of the\r\nexistence of the late Bank of the United States its circulation barely\r\nexceeded $4,000,000, and for five of its most prosperous years it was\r\nabout equal to $16,000,000; furthermore, the authority given to receive\r\nprivate deposits to a limited amount and to issue certificates in such\r\nsums as may be called for by the depositors may so far fill up the\r\nchannels of circulation as greatly to diminish the necessity of any\r\nconsiderable issue of Treasury notes. A restraint upon the amount of\r\nprivate deposits has seemed to be indispensably necessary from an\r\napprehension, thought to be well founded, that in any emergency of trade\r\nconfidence might be so far shaken in the banks as to induce a withdrawal\r\nfrom them of private deposits with a view to insure their unquestionable\r\nsafety when deposited with the Government, which might prove eminently\r\ndisastrous to the State banks. Is it objected that it is proposed to\r\nauthorize the agencies to deal in bills of exchange? It is answered that\r\nsuch dealings are to be carried on at the lowest possible premium, are\r\nmade to rest on an unquestionably sound basis, are designed to reimburse\r\nmerely the expenses which would otherwise devolve upon the Treasury, and\r\nare in strict subordination to the decision of the Supreme Court in the\r\ncase of the Bank of Augusta against Earle, and other reported cases, and\r\nthereby avoids all conflict with State jurisdiction, which I hold to be\r\nindispensably requisite. It leaves the banking privileges of the States\r\nwithout interference, looks to the Treasury and the Union, and while\r\nfurnishing every facility to the first is careful of the interests of\r\nthe last. But above all, it is created by law, is amendable by law, and\r\nis repealable by law, and, wedded as I am to no theory, but looking\r\nsolely to the advancement of the public good, I shall be among the very\r\nfirst to urge its repeal if it be found not to subserve the purposes and\r\nobjects for which it may be created. Nor will the plan be submitted in\r\nany overweening confidence in the sufficiency of my own judgment, but\r\nwith much greater reliance on the wisdom and patriotism of Congress.\r\nI can not abandon this subject without urging upon you in the most\r\nemphatic manner, whatever may be your action on the suggestions which\r\nI have felt it to be my duty to submit, to relieve the Chief Executive\r\nMagistrate, by any and all constitutional means, from a controlling\r\npower over the public Treasury. If in the plan proposed, should you deem\r\nit worthy of your consideration, that separation is not as complete as\r\nyou may desire, you will doubtless amend it in that particular. For\r\nmyself, I disclaim all desire to have any control over the public moneys\r\nother than what is indispensably necessary to execute the laws which you\r\nmay pass.\r\n\r\nNor can I fail to advert in this connection to the debts which many of\r\nthe States of the Union have contracted abroad and under which they\r\ncontinue to labor. That indebtedness amounts to a sum not less than\r\n$200,000,000, and which has been retributed to them for the most part\r\nin works of internal improvement which are destined to prove of vast\r\nimportance in ultimately advancing their prosperity and wealth. For the\r\ndebts thus contracted the States are alone responsible. I can do no more\r\nthan express the belief that each State will feel itself bound by every\r\nconsideration of honor as well as of interest to meet its engagements\r\nwith punctuality. The failure, however, of any one State to do so should\r\nin no degree affect the credit of the rest, and the foreign capitalist\r\nwill have no just cause to experience alarm as to all other State stocks\r\nbecause any one or more of the States may neglect to provide with\r\npunctuality the means of redeeming their engagements. Even such States,\r\nshould there be any, considering the great rapidity with which their\r\nresources are developing themselves, will not fail to have the means\r\nat no very distant day to redeem their obligations to the uttermost\r\nfarthing; nor will I doubt but that, in view of that honorable conduct\r\nwhich has evermore governed the States and the people of the Union, they\r\nwill each and all resort to every legitimate expedient before they will\r\nforego a faithful compliance with their obligations.\r\n\r\nFrom the report of the Secretary of War and other reports accompanying\r\nit you will be informed of the progress which has been made in the\r\nfortifications designed for the protection of our principal cities,\r\nroadsteads, and inland frontier during the present year, together with\r\ntheir true state and condition. They will be prosecuted to completion\r\nwith all the expedition which the means placed by Congress at the\r\ndisposal of the Executive will allow.\r\n\r\nI recommend particularly to your consideration that portion of the\r\nSecretary's report which proposes the establishment of a chain of\r\nmilitary posts from Council Bluffs to some point on the Pacific Ocean\r\nwithin our limits. The benefit thereby destined to accrue to our\r\ncitizens engaged in the fur trade over that wilderness region, added\r\nto the importance of cultivating friendly relations with savage tribes\r\ninhabiting it, and at the same time of giving protection to our frontier\r\nsettlements and of establishing the means of safe intercourse between\r\nthe American settlements at the mouth of the Columbia River and those on\r\nthis side of the Rocky Mountains, would seem to suggest the importance\r\nof carrying into effect the recommendations upon this head with as\r\nlittle delay as may be practicable.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy will place you in possession\r\nof the present condition of that important arm of the national defense.\r\nEvery effort will be made to add to its efficiency, and I can not too\r\nstrongly urge upon you liberal appropriations to that branch of the\r\npublic service. Inducements of the weightiest character exist for the\r\nadoption of this course of policy. Our extended and otherwise exposed\r\nmaritime frontier calls for protection, to the furnishing of which an\r\nefficient naval force is indispensable. We look to no foreign conquests,\r\nnor do we propose to enter into competition with any other nation for\r\nsupremacy on the ocean; but it is due not only to the honor but to the\r\nsecurity of the people of the United States that no nation should be\r\npermitted to invade our waters at pleasure and subject our towns and\r\nvillages to conflagration or pillage. Economy in all branches of the\r\npublic service is due from all the public agents to the people, but\r\nparsimony alone would suggest the withholding of the necessary means for\r\nthe protection of our domestic firesides from invasion and our national\r\nhonor from disgrace. I would most earnestly recommend to Congress to\r\nabstain from all appropriations for objects not absolutely necessary;\r\nbut I take upon myself, without a moment of hesitancy, all the\r\nresponsibility of recommending the increase and prompt equipment of\r\nthat gallant Navy which has lighted up every sea with its victories\r\nand spread an imperishable glory over the country.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General will claim your particular\r\nattention, not only because of the valuable suggestions which it\r\ncontains, but because of the great importance which at all times\r\nattaches to that interesting branch of the public service. The increased\r\nexpense of transporting the mail along the principal routes necessarily\r\nclaims the public attention, and has awakened a corresponding solicitude\r\non the part of the Government. The transmission of the mail must keep\r\npace with those facilities of intercommunication which are every day\r\nbecoming greater through the building of railroads and the application\r\nof steam power, but it can not be disguised that in order to do so the\r\nPost-Office Department is subjected to heavy exactions. The lines of\r\ncommunication between distant parts of the Union are to a great extent\r\noccupied by railroads, which, in the nature of things, possess a\r\ncomplete monopoly, and the Department is therefore liable to heavy and\r\nunreasonable charges. This evil is destined to great increase in future,\r\nand some timely measure may become necessary to guard against it.\r\n\r\nI feel it my duty to bring under your consideration a practice which has\r\ngrown up in the administration of the Government, and which, I am deeply\r\nconvinced, ought to be corrected. I allude to the exercise of the power\r\nwhich usage rather than reason has vested in the Presidents of removing\r\nincumbents from office in order to substitute others more in favor with\r\nthe dominant party. My own conduct in this respect has been governed by\r\na conscientious purpose to exercise the removing power only in cases of\r\nunfaithfulness or inability, or in those in which its exercise appeared\r\nnecessary in order to discountenance and suppress that spirit of active\r\npartisanship on the part of holders of office which not only withdraws\r\nthem from the steady and impartial discharge of their official duties,\r\nbut exerts an undue and injurious influence over elections and degrades\r\nthe character of the Government itself, inasmuch as it exhibits the\r\nChief Magistrate as being a party through his agents in the secret plots\r\nor open workings of political parties.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the exercise of this power nothing should be left to\r\ndiscretion which may safely be regulated by law, and it is of high\r\nimportance to restrain as far as possible the stimulus of personal\r\ninterests in public elections. Considering the great increase which has\r\nbeen made in public offices in the last quarter of a century and the\r\nprobability of further increase, we incur the hazard of witnessing\r\nviolent political contests, directed too often to the single object of\r\nretaining office by those who are in or obtaining it by those who are\r\nout. Under the influence of these convictions I shall cordially concur\r\nin any constitutional measure for regulating and, by regulating,\r\nrestraining the power of removal.\r\n\r\nI suggest for your consideration the propriety of making without further\r\ndelay some specific application of the funds derived under the will of\r\nMr. Smithson, of England, for the diffusion of knowledge, and which have\r\nheretofore been vested in public stocks until such time as Congress\r\nshould think proper to give them a specific direction. Nor will you, I\r\nfeel confident, permit any abatement of the principal of the legacy to\r\nbe made should it turn out that the stocks in which the investments have\r\nbeen made have undergone a depreciation.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I commend to your care the interests of this District, for\r\nwhich you are the exclusive legislators. Considering that this city is\r\nthe residence of the Government and for a large part of the year of\r\nCongress, and considering also the great cost of the public buildings\r\nand the propriety of affording them at all times careful protection, it\r\nseems not unreasonable that Congress should contribute toward the\r\nexpense of an efficient police.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL

DANIEL WEBSTER,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of State_:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, commissioners appointed by the President of the United\r\nStates for the purpose of exploring and surveying the boundary line\r\nbetween the States of Maine and New Hampshire and the British Provinces\r\nin North America, respectfully report--\r\n\r\nThat in pursuance of the duties of their appointment they have in the\r\ncourse of the late season performed the following surveys and\r\nexplorations:\r\n\r\n1. The meridian line of the monument at the source of the St. Croix has,\r\nunder the direction of J.D. Graham, been carefully and accurately traced\r\nfrom the station in the vicinity of Houlton where the labors of the year\r\n1840 terminated to a point 4 miles north of the St. John River in the\r\nvicinity of the Grand Falls, being a distance of 81 miles from the\r\nmonument. The timber has been removed along this line to a width\r\nnecessary for its accurate prolongation and for the requisite\r\nastronomical observations at various points upon it, and a correct\r\nprofile, or vertical section, has also been obtained by means of the\r\nspirit level the whole of the distance above mentioned.\r\n\r\nBesides the astronomical observations necessary to obtain and continue\r\nthe due north direction upon this line, numerous magnetic observations\r\nhave also been made at a number of points upon it, in order to show the\r\nphysical causes which must operate to produce serious discrepancies\r\nbetween a meridian line properly traced and such a one as has actually\r\nseparated the jurisdiction of the two Governments since the attempt in\r\nthe years 1817 and 1818 to define and mark this portion of the boundary\r\nunder the provisions of the treaty of Ghent, although no portion of that\r\nline was ever ratified or made binding upon the parties to the treaty.\r\n\r\nUpon this portion of the survey there have been chained, including\r\nmeasured offsets to the old line and to other important points, 85\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nFour hundred and fifty-two transit observations of heavenly bodies have\r\nbeen made, aided by three excellent chronometers, for the determination\r\nof the true meridian direction, most of which also served for the\r\ncomputation of the correct time.\r\n\r\nFor the determination of the longitude of this meridian west of the\r\nRoyal Observatory of Greenwich and the latitudes of four important\r\npoints upon it there were made eighty-five complete sets of astronomical\r\nobservations, including altitudes of the sun and stars and the meridian\r\ntransits of the moon and moon-culminating stars.\r\n\r\nThe number of barometric observations made upon the line and in its\r\nvicinity is 5,767; besides which there were made at Calais, for\r\ncomparison with the level of mean tide on the St. Croix, 1,336 similar\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nThere have been determined in altitude above or below the level of the\r\nmonument, by means of the spirit level, 1,716 points, and the altitudes\r\nof 1,816 other points have been similarly observed in order to verify\r\nthe altitude of the monument above the level of mean tide at Calais.\r\n\r\nFor the determination of the magnetic variation at a number of points on\r\nthe meridian line, more than 200 observations have been made upon four\r\ndifferent needles, and for the determination of the magnetic dip at four\r\nprincipal stations on the same meridian 300 observations have been made\r\nupon two different needles.\r\n\r\nUnder the directions of the same commissioner the line claimed by Great\r\nBritain from Mars Hill and that recently chosen by Messrs. Mudge and\r\nFeatherstonhaugh have been surveyed westward from the meridian line to\r\nthe highlands near the head waters of the Aroostook, and the necessary\r\ndata obtained for the construction of a correct map of that portion of\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nUpon this survey, without reckoning the distances traveled for\r\napproaching many important points of observation, there have been\r\nactually measured with the chain and coursed with proper instruments 267\r\nmiles, including the Aroostook River from its mouth to the point where\r\nit receives the Lapawmpeag Stream, a profile of the country from the\r\nhead waters of the Moluncus to the St. John at Fish River, and such\r\nother important lines as were necessary for obtaining the correct\r\ntopography of the country, and the altitudes of many points upon the\r\nline claimed by Great Britain as the boundary, in the vicinity of the\r\nAroostook, have been obtained.\r\n\r\nTen principal points have been determined in latitude and longitude by\r\nmeans of 115 sets of astronomical observations, aided by three good\r\nchronometers, and seventeen other points have been determined by\r\ntriangulation with a portable theodolite. Two hundred and five points\r\nhave been determined in altitude by means of 1,319 barometric\r\nobservations, and seventeen by means of the theodolite and spirit level.\r\nOne hundred and ninety-two observations have been made for determining\r\nthe variation of the magnetic needle at three important points.\r\n\r\nThe field duties above mentioned are considered to furnish sufficient\r\ndata for a correct map of the line reported upon by the late British\r\ncommissioners, Colonel Mudge and Mr. Featherstonhaugh, between the\r\nSt. John River and the head of the Aroostook, besides some lateral\r\nexplorations of considerable extent that will have an important bearing\r\nupon this branch of the subject. The work accomplished is full as much\r\nas could have been properly done in a single season, marked, as the\r\nlast was, by an unusual drought of long continuance, which rendered\r\nit impossible to ascend, even with light canoes, some of the smaller\r\nstreams, especially those forming the northwesternmost sources of the\r\nAroostook. These might be profitably explored another season.\r\n\r\n2. The division under the direction of A. Talcott has, besides verifying\r\na part of the line of 1840 and tracing the course of Indian Stream (a\r\nbranch of the Connecticut) to its source, explored and surveyed the line\r\nof highlands which extends from the Kennebec road to the Temiscouata\r\nportage, and so much of the line claimed by Great Britain as extends\r\nfrom the Kennebec road to the eastward as far as the head of the\r\nAroostook River.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this survey, without counting the lines of approach\r\nor ground traveled over more than once, 703 miles have been passed over\r\nand such notes taken as will form the basis of a map. Of these 703\r\nmiles, 335 are upon the lines respectively claimed as boundaries by\r\nthe Governments of the United States and Great Britain. In the course\r\nof these surveys, in order to the geographical determination of the\r\nposition of the line, the latitudes of 54 points have been determined\r\nby means of 114 sets of altitudes of heavenly bodies, and the sets of\r\nsubsidiary observations for time and for the determination of longitude\r\nby chronometers amount to 245. The number of points at which\r\nobservations have been made by barometers for the purpose of determining\r\ntheir altitudes is 930, of which 669 are upon the boundaries\r\nrespectively claimed by the two countries. The number of separate sets\r\nof barometric readings made at these points amounts to 1,981, while\r\nthose made at the fixed stations, with which the former are to be\r\ncompared, amount to 1,671.\r\n\r\n3. The division under the direction of J. Renwick has explored or\r\nsurveyed the line of highlands from the southeastern extremity of Lake\r\nMatapediac to the vicinity of the river Du Loup, where the line of\r\nsurvey has been connected with that of A. Talcott. In this survey a gap\r\nis yet left of a few miles on the western side of the valley of the\r\nRimouski near its source.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the operations of this division 586 miles have been\r\npassed over and such notes taken as will form the basis of a map. Of\r\nthese 586 miles, 275 have been actually measured, 209 are upon the\r\nboundary claimed by the United States, and about 30 upon the line\r\npointed out by the proclamation of the King of Great Britain of the 7th\r\nof October, 1763, as the southern boundary of the Province of Quebec,\r\nmaking in all 239 miles of the height of land.\r\n\r\nIn the course of these surveys, in order to the geographical\r\ndetermination of the position of the line, the latitudes of 47 points\r\nhave been determined by means of 85 sets of altitudes of heavenly\r\nbodies, and the sets of subsidiary observations for time and for the\r\ndetermination of longitude by chronometers amount to 130. The number\r\nof points at which observations have been made by barometers for the\r\npurpose of determining their altitudes is 407, of which 267 are upon the\r\nboundary claimed by the United States. The number of separate sets of\r\nbarometric readings made at these points amounts to 1,153, while those\r\nmade at the fixed stations amount to 837.\r\n\r\nThe division of Major Graham not having returned from the field\r\nuntil within a few days, neither the reduction of the astronomical\r\nobservations nor any of the office work preparatory to a general map\r\nhas yet been commenced by his division.\r\n\r\nThe office work of the divisions of A. Talcott and J. Renwick has been\r\nsteadily carried on since the return of those commissioners from the\r\nfield in the month of October, and great progress has been made in the\r\ncalculations and plotting preparatory to the construction of maps, and\r\nnecessary as materials for a general report.\r\n\r\nIn this state of the work of the several divisions the undersigned find\r\nthemselves under the necessity of communicating to the State Department\r\nthat the further progress of their operations is about to be arrested by\r\nthe exhaustion of the appropriation, and of stating that unless speedy\r\nprovision be made for the supply of the necessary funds the report of\r\ntheir operations can not be made up in time to be laid before Congress\r\nat its present session.\r\n\r\nThe position of the finances of the commission may be seen by the\r\nfollowing statement:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Of the appropriation of $75,000 there have been drawn--\r\n\r\n  By J. Renwick   $21,000\r\n  By A. Talcott    24,200\r\n  By J.D. Graham   25,000\r\n  Total drawn      70,200\r\n\r\n  Leaving in the Treasury of the United States $4,800.\r\n\r\n  By a careful estimate it is found that to finish the office work of the\r\n  several divisions there will be required over and above any balances in\r\n  the hands of the several commissioners--\r\n\r\n  For the division of J. Renwick                        $3,000\r\n  For the division of A. Talcott                         5,800\r\n  For the division of J.D. Graham, including some\r\n  arrearages due for instruments and to assistant\r\n  engineers attached to this division                    6,500\r\n\r\n  Making in all $15,300, and leaving to be provided\r\n  for the completion of the work of the late season    $10,500.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe undersigned can not refrain from stating that the necessity of\r\napplying for further funds was unexpected by each of them individually,\r\nas it is painful to them collectively. There are, however, reasons that\r\nin their opinion are incontrovertible which have led to an expenditure\r\nthus exceeding their estimate submitted to the Secretary of State the\r\n11th of January, 1841:\r\n\r\n1. The estimate for the expenses of the division under the direction of\r\nMajor Graham amounted to $22,500. This referred only, however, to the\r\ncontinuation of the survey of the meridian line; and as the country had\r\nbeen represented by the most authentic maps as generally rising from the\r\nmonument to the north, it was inferred that the timber to be cut away\r\nin opening this line through a dense forest would be of the description\r\ngenerally found upon elevated and dry lands, and the labor supposed to\r\nbe requisite was estimated accordingly. So far, however, from this being\r\nthe case, 26 miles out of the 32 between the base of Parks Ridge, near\r\nHoulton, and the river Des Chutes (6 miles north of the latitude of Mars\r\nHill) have actually been found to be below the level of the monument and\r\nintersected by swamps covered with a thick growth of cedar and other\r\ntimber common to such land, extremely difficult to cut away. More than\r\ndouble the labor estimated had therefore to be performed in\r\naccomplishing this and all similar portions of the work, and a\r\ncorresponding increase of expense was unavoidable.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this increased labor upon the meridian line, the division\r\nof Major Graham has executed the surveys between that line and the head\r\nwaters of the Aroostook, already given in detail, the expenses for which\r\nwere not estimated or included in the sum above mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe cost of this survey, including the instruments that were required\r\nfor it, has amounted to $5,500, and while this sum should be added to\r\nthe original estimate for this division, the expenses of the divisions\r\nof the other two commissioners have not in any manner been thereby\r\ndiminished, for the actual quantity of work performed by them has\r\nexceeded what was supposed from the best maps extant to be necessary\r\nupon the whole of the lines claimed by the two Governments,\r\nrespectively, exclusive of the meridian line, as will hereafter be\r\nshown.\r\n\r\nThere was another cause which tended in a great degree to augment the\r\nexpenses of this division in proportion to the progress of the work,\r\nwhich it was not within the power of human agency to control, and which\r\nwe should not omit to mention here.\r\n\r\nThe severe drought which prevailed throughout this region of country\r\nduring the month of August and the greater part of September caused the\r\nfires which are annually set to the fallen timber upon newly cleared\r\nlands to spread far and wide into the growing forest, and so rapid was\r\nits progress and so serious its ravages as to compel the inhabitants\r\nin many cases to fly for the preservation of life. Some check was\r\nexperienced in the duties along the meridian line from the flames that\r\nactually embraced it, but a far more serious one from the dense smoke\r\nwhich filled the atmosphere almost incessantly for six weeks, and so\r\nobstructed the view as to render it impossible to fix the stations in\r\nadvance with the requisite precision.\r\n\r\nWhile the party charged with the astronomical operations was thus\r\ndeprived of the opportunity of making scarcely any progress for six\r\nweeks, the expense of maintaining it could not in any way be diminished,\r\nbecause there was a daily hope that such a change in the weather might\r\noccur as would have removed this difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn order to make amends as far as practicable for so much time\r\nunavoidably lost, this division continued to prosecute its field duties\r\nnorth of the forty-seventh degree of latitude until several weeks after\r\nthe severities of winter had commenced, with no other protection than\r\ntheir tents, the commissioner in charge of it believing that the\r\nexpectations of the Government and of the country generally would but be\r\nfulfilled by the investigations in relation to this important line being\r\npushed to the utmost attainable point. But for this it would have been\r\nimpossible to have reached the St. John River the late season.\r\n\r\nThere remains to be surveyed along this meridian line, in order to reach\r\nthe northwest angle of Nova Scotia as claimed by the United States,\r\nabout 64 miles, to accomplish which will require another season of\r\nactive field duty.\r\n\r\n2. In the estimate for the work of the divisions of A. Talcott and J.\r\nRenwick it was assumed that the length of the boundary remaining on the\r\nline claimed by the United States was 320 miles, and upon the lines\r\nclaimed by Great Britain 170 miles.\r\n\r\nOf the latter, about one-half was undertaken by Major Graham's\r\ndivision,[19] leaving for the estimated distance to be surveyed by the\r\ndivisions of A. Talcott and J. Renwick 450 miles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: It has already been stated that in the survey of the\r\nportion of this line allotted to Major Graham there were actually\r\nmeasured upon it, with the chain, 276 miles, and this did not constitute\r\nmore than one-half the labor and expense incident to all the duties\r\nenumerated and performed by his division on his portion, so much did the\r\nwork required upon this portion of it exceed what was estimated for the\r\nwhole of it.]\r\n\r\nIt will appear by the statement hereinbefore given that the joint\r\nsurveys of these two divisions upon the lines of highlands have actually\r\namounted to 574 miles. Upon the principle of their estimate, the\r\nprobable cost of this would have amounted to $49,746.37, and with the\r\naddition for instruments and for the additional cost of the more remote\r\nparts of the line to $57,079.70.\r\n\r\nThe actual cost, including the foregoing estimate for the completion of\r\nthe work, is $54,000.\r\n\r\nIt will appear, therefore, that when the increased extent of the work\r\nperformed over that made the basis of the estimate is considered, the\r\ncost of performing it, so far from having exceeded the estimate, has\r\nfallen short of it by $3,000.\r\n\r\nThe reason of the discrepancy between the real extent of the line, as\r\nactually measured, and that which formed the basis of the calculation is\r\nthat the latter was made by reference to the best existing maps, which\r\nwere considered to be entitled to a certain degree of credit. Upon the\r\nclose examination which the operations of the late season have afforded,\r\nthese maps have been ascertained to be exceedingly erroneous. Well-known\r\nstreams have been found to extend in either direction many miles beyond\r\nthe points at which their sources have been laid down on the maps, and\r\ngreat rivers and lakes have, as it were, been discovered, of which no\r\ndelineation had ever been given by geographers. The extent of these\r\nerrors in remote and difficultly accessible points may be inferred from\r\nwhat has been found to occur in the part of the region which is most\r\naccessible, best known, and most frequently traversed.\r\n\r\nOn the Temiscouata portage, a road traveled weekly by the mail of Her\r\nBritannic Majesty, continually passed by the officers of her various\r\nservices, which had been carefully surveyed by civil engineers\r\npreparatory to its reconstruction, and which has been traveled by the\r\nsurveyors of both countries under the joint commission, it had hitherto\r\nbeen believed, and it was so represented on all maps, both English and\r\nAmerican, that the line dividing the waters crossed the road three\r\ntimes. The surveys of the late season show that the boundary claimed by\r\nthe United States crosses this road five times, and it became necessary\r\nto explore the culminating points of the valleys of four streams,\r\ninstead of two, as had been anticipated. Instances of the same sort, but\r\nwhich do not admit of verbal description, have occurred on every part of\r\nthe lines of highlands.\r\n\r\nThe two commissioners whose operations are under consideration no doubt\r\nhad it in their power to have suspended their operations and returned so\r\nsoon as the portion of the appropriation placed at their disposal was so\r\nfar exhausted as to leave no more than would be needed to complete their\r\noffice work; but they feel satisfied that they would not have been\r\njustified in so doing so long as any portion of the line remained\r\nunsurveyed or the weather would permit a party to keep the field. Thus,\r\nalthough in the original plan for the partition of the work it was\r\nestimated that their lines would probably be connected in the parallel\r\nof the river Ouelle, about 30 miles south of Temiscouata portage, when\r\nit was found that, from unforeseen delays in the transportation of the\r\nparty of J. Renwick by sea to their work, and on the river St. Lawrence\r\nfrom one station to another, it became doubtful whether he could pass\r\nthe Temiscouata portage before the woods became impassable, his\r\ncolleague continued his parties in the field until the junction was\r\neffected. In this way, while the expenses of the division of J. Renwick\r\nhave not been materially diminished, those of the division of A. Talcott\r\nhave been largely increased; but a portion of the general work has been\r\naccomplished which might otherwise have been left incomplete.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, in conclusion, beg leave respectfully to urge the\r\nimportance of a speedy appropriation to enable them to make up their\r\nreport. A delay of any continuance will be productive of evil, either by\r\nenhancing the cost of office work or by rendering it difficult in\r\nconsequence of the dispersion of the engineers and surveyors by whom the\r\nfield notes have been taken. Upon the completion only of such a report\r\nwill it be possible to render apparent how much of the whole task has\r\nbeen accomplished and how much remains to be performed; and the\r\nDepartment will then have it in its power to decide whether the part\r\nthat has not been completed is of such importance to the question at\r\nissue as to require further operations upon it.\r\n\r\nAll which is respectfully submitted.\r\n\r\nJAS. RENWICK,\r\n  A. TALCOTT,\r\n    J.D. GRAHAM,\r\n     _Commissioners_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 25, 1842_.\r\n\r\nHon. DANIEL WEBSTER,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\nSIR: The undersigned, commissioners appointed by the President of the\r\nUnited States for the purpose of surveying and exploring the boundary\r\nline between the States of Maine and New Hampshire and the British\r\nProvinces, beg leave, in compliance with your directions, to submit an\r\nestimate for the operations of the commission for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nSo much of your directions as regards the state of the survey and the\r\namount required to complete the office work preparatory to a report has\r\nalready been laid before you in their report of the 4th January, 1842,\r\nprepared in anticipation of your orders. By reference thereto it will\r\nappear that the delineation of the meridian of the source of St. Croix\r\nhas not, in spite of every effort on the part of the commissioner to\r\nwhom it was assigned, been pursued farther than 81 miles from the\r\nmonument. Sixty-four miles, therefore, of the said meridian line remain\r\nto be surveyed before this part of their task is completed. The other\r\ntwo commissioners, while they would not have hesitated to join in a\r\nfinal report in case the state of the survey of the meridian line would\r\nhave permitted it, are aware that the hasty manner in which their work\r\nwas performed, in anticipation of completing the object of their\r\nappointment during the past year, leaves room for a more accurate\r\nexamination of some parts of the lines they have surveyed. Some\r\nportions, also, of the lines intrusted to them, respectively, were not\r\nreached; and, in addition, a part of the survey which was contemplated\r\nin their original instructions from your predecessor was not included in\r\ntheir estimates for the past year, in consequence of its having only a\r\ncollateral relation to the main object.\r\n\r\nThus the surveys respectively undertaken by Messrs. Talcott and Graham\r\nof the lines claimed on the part of Great Britain and by Messrs. Mudge\r\nand Featherstonhaugh, although brought near to each other, have not been\r\nunited, and a part of the highlands claimed by the United States near\r\nthe source of the Rimouski was not reached by the parties of Professor\r\nRenwick.\r\n\r\nThe height of a part of the line explored by Captain Talcott in 1840,\r\nlying at the source of Arnolds River, was not determined for the want of\r\na barometer.\r\n\r\nTwo or three miles in length of the line of highlands near the source of\r\nthe river Du Loup require to be reexamined.\r\n\r\nThe longitudes of Lake Megantic, Lake Etchemin, the source of the\r\nMetjarmette, upon the line of Captain Talcott, and of some one point\r\non the line of Professor Renwick ought to be ascertained with greater\r\nprecision than the time that could be allowed during the last season\r\nwould permit.\r\n\r\nThe instructions of Mr. Forsyth contemplated an exploration of the\r\nhighlands described in the proclamation of 1763 as beginning on the\r\nnorth shore of the Bay of Chaleurs. The existence of a continuous\r\nelevated region from the tide of that bay to the termination of the\r\nexploring meridian line has been ascertained in a manner satisfactory to\r\nthe commission, but the heights have not been measured on that part of\r\nit which lies nearest to the Bay of Chaleurs.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the undersigned are of opinion that as no\r\ndelay in the presentation of a final report will arise from further\r\nexplorations of the parts of the territory thus pointed out and the more\r\naccurate examination of the uncertain matters, it would add to the\r\nconfidence which may be placed in their results that a party be employed\r\nunder the direction of each of the above-named commissioners upon the\r\nsaid work. For this object it is estimated--\r\n\r\n1. That $25,000 in all, say $12,500 to be expended under the direction\r\nof each of the two above-named commissioners, will suffice. A less sum\r\nthan this will not keep two parties in the field during the working\r\nseason; a larger sum could not advantageously be expended on this part\r\nof the work.\r\n\r\n2. In estimating the amount necessary for completing the delineation of\r\nthe meridian of the source of the river St. Croix, it will be borne in\r\nmind that numerous astronomical observations must be made in aid of the\r\noperations with the transit instrument, in order constantly to preserve\r\nthe true north direction, a condition of the utmost consequence, not\r\nalone as affecting the extent of territory that will be embraced by\r\nit, but more particularly because the character and position of the\r\nhighlands alluded to in the treaty of 1783 would be exhibited in a very\r\ndifferent light as encountered by a line running _due north_, as is\r\nrequired by the treaty, and by one varying even in a slight degree from\r\nthat direction. This principle has already been exhibited in a striking\r\nmanner by the trace of the meridian line as far as it has now\r\nprogressed, for instead of encountering highlands in the latitude of\r\nMars Hill having a claim to be considered those described in the treaty\r\nas the intended boundary between the two countries, the line as recently\r\ntraced actually passes that latitude at an elevation of less than\r\n10 feet above the level of the monument, and the greatest elevation\r\nencountered by this line in passing over any spur connected with Mars\r\nHill is 63 feet above the level of the monument. In advance of this spur\r\nthe line becomes again depressed below the level of the monument at\r\nseveral points before it reaches the Aroostook.\r\n\r\nThese, however, are only a few of the many facts that might be adduced\r\nfrom the surveys already made to show how important it is to the\r\nquestion at issue that every necessary means to avail of the aids\r\nof science should be adopted in order to preserve scrupulously the\r\ndirection specified in the treaty while tracing this line. It must also\r\nbe remembered that in the further prosecution of this duty a wilderness\r\nhas to be traversed, totally uninhabited and totally without roads. The\r\nonly means of progressing through it and of transporting the necessary\r\nprovisions and the instruments indispensable to accuracy will be by\r\nmeans of canoes, for supplying two or three depots at points where Grand\r\nRiver and the waters of the Restigouche intersect the line, leaving the\r\nwhole transportation along the meridian to be performed by packmen, or\r\nmen carrying burdens on their backs. That the usual avenue to give an\r\nunimpeded view along the line must be opened through a dense forest,\r\nwhich in the neighborhood of all streams crossing it will still be\r\nfound to consist of that swampy growth described in the report from the\r\nundersigned of the 4th of January instant as requiring so much labor to\r\ncut through it.\r\n\r\nWith all these circumstances in view, the following estimate for the\r\ncompletion of the survey of the meridian line and for some further\r\nsurveys between that line and the source of the Aroostook is submitted;\r\nand it is intended to embrace the expense of completing both the field\r\nand the office wort that will require to be done in order to a final\r\naccomplishment of the duties:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Estimate for the meridian line_.\r\n\r\n  1. Pay of 4 assistant engineers from May 1, 1842,\r\n     to March 31, 1843, being 304 days, at $4 per day each    $4,864.00\r\n\r\n  2.

Desirous always\r\nto lay before Congress and the public everything affecting the state of\r\nthe country to the fullest extent consistent with propriety and\r\nprudence, I have to inform the House of Representatives that in my\r\njudgment no communication could be made by me at this time on the\r\nsubject of its resolution without detriment or danger to the public\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 28, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to submit copies of the correspondence[25] and other\r\ndocuments called for by the resolution of the House of Representatives\r\nof the 2d February.\r\n\r\nI am not informed of the existence of any official opinion of the late\r\nJudge Johnson on the unconstitutionality of the act or acts of the State\r\nof South Carolina upon the subject referred to in the resolution.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Relating to an act of the legislature of South Carolina\r\nproviding for the imprisonment of free negroes found on board vessels\r\nentering any of the ports of that State, complaints of the British\r\nGovernment relative to the operation of said act, etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 8, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI feel it to be my duty to invite your attention to the accompanying\r\ncommunication from the Secretary of the Treasury, in relation to the\r\nprobable demands which will be made upon the Treasury for the present\r\nquarter. It will be seen that, without arresting the requisitions which\r\nwill be made by the War and Navy Departments for the months of March,\r\nApril, and May, there will be an unprovided-for deficit of upward of\r\nthree millions.\r\n\r\nI can not bring myself, however, to believe that it will enter into the\r\nview of any department of the Government to arrest works of defense now\r\nin progress of completion or vessels under construction or preparation\r\nfor sea. Having due regard to the unsettled condition of our foreign\r\nrelations and the exposed situation of our inland and maritime frontier,\r\nI should feel myself wanting in my duty to the country if I could\r\nhesitate in urging upon Congress all necessary appropriations for\r\nplacing it in an attitude of strength and security. Such recommendation,\r\nhowever, has heretofore been made in full reliance as well on Congress\r\nas on the well-known patriotism of the people, their high sense of\r\nnational honor, and their determination to defend our soil from the\r\npossibility, however remote, of a hostile invasion.\r\n\r\nThe diminution in the revenue arising from the great diminution of\r\nduties under what is commonly called the compromise act necessarily\r\ninvolves the Treasury in embarrassments, which have been for some years\r\npalliated by the temporary expedient of issuing Treasury notes--an\r\nexpedient which, affording no permanent relief, has imposed upon\r\nCongress from time to time the necessity of replacing the old by a new\r\nissue. The amount outstanding on the 4th of March, 1840, varies in no\r\ngreat degree from the amount which will be outstanding on the 1st\r\nof January next, while in the interim the new issues are rendered\r\nequivalent to the redemption of the old, and at the end of the fiscal\r\nyear leave an augmented pressure on the finances by the accumulation\r\nof interest.\r\n\r\nThe contemplated revision of the tariff of duties may, and doubtless\r\nwill, lead in the end to a relief of the Treasury from these constantly\r\nrecurring embarrassments, but it must be obvious that time will be\r\nnecessary to realize the full anticipations of financial benefit from\r\nany modification of the tariff laws. In the meantime I submit to\r\nCongress the suggestions made by the Secretary, and invite its prompt\r\nand speedy action.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 8, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn my message of the 7th of December I suggested to Congress the\r\npropriety, and in some degree the necessity, of making proper provisions\r\nby law within the pale of the Constitution for the removal at their\r\ncommencement and at the option of the party of all such cases as might\r\narise in State courts involving national questions or questions touching\r\nthe faithful observance and discharge of the international obligations\r\nof the United States from such State tribunal to the Federal judiciary.\r\nI am urged to repeat at this time this recommendation by the receipt of\r\nintelligence, upon which I can rely, that a subject of Great Britain\r\nresiding in Upper Canada has been arrested upon a charge of connection\r\nwith the expedition fitted out by the Canadian authorities by which the\r\n_Caroline_ was destroyed, and will in all probability be subjected to\r\ntrial in the State courts of New York. It is doubtful whether in this\r\nstate of things, should his discharge be demanded by the British\r\nGovernment, this Government is invested with any control over the\r\nsubject until the case shall have reached the court of final resort of\r\nthe State of New York and been decided in that court; and although such\r\ndelay ought not, in a national point of view to give cause of umbrage\r\nto Great Britain, yet the prompt and instant rendering of justice to\r\nforeign nations should be placed among our highest duties. I can not,\r\ntherefore, in consideration of what properly becomes the United States,\r\nand in anticipation of any demand from a foreign government for the\r\ndischarge of one of its subjects, forego the duty of repeating my\r\nrecommendation to Congress for the immediate Adoption of some suitable\r\nlegislative provision on this subject.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 11, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n23d ultimo, I communicate to that body a report from the Secretary of\r\nState, conveying copies of the correspondence[26] which contains the\r\ninformation called for by said resolution.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Relating to complaints of Spain and Portugal that the\r\noperation of the revenue act of September 11, 1841, infringed treaty\r\nstipulations.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 12, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have reason to think that the rejection of Silas Reed as\r\nsurveyor-general of Illinois and Missouri on the evening of the last day\r\nof the session of the Senate at the last session of Congress was founded\r\nin a misapprehension of facts, which, while it deprived the public of\r\nthe services of a useful officer, left him to suffer a considerable\r\ndegree of injustice in his reputation. After mature reflection upon all\r\nthe circumstances of his case, and particularly of facts which have\r\nbecome known since his rejection, I have felt it my duty to submit his\r\nnomination for the same office anew to the Senate for its advice and\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\nI therefore nominate Silas Reed to be surveyor-general of Illinois and\r\nMissouri, in place of Joseph C. Brown, removed.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 15, 1842.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI take the earliest moment to correct an error into which I\r\ninadvertently fell in my message of the 12th instant, nominating Silas\r\nReed to be surveyor-general for Illinois and Missouri. In that message I\r\nrepresent the nominee as being rejected by the Senate on the evening of\r\nthe last day of the last session of Congress, when upon a more accurate\r\ninquiry I find that he was rejected on the 14th of August, 1841, and\r\nhis successor nominated on the 23d August and confirmed on the 13th\r\nSeptember, which was the last day of the last session of Congress, and\r\nwhich fact had become identified in my memory, upon which I drew when\r\nI wrote the message, with the fact of his rejection.\r\n\r\nI hasten to make the correction, not deeming it, however, of much moment\r\nin regard to the real merits of the nomination; for whether the\r\nrejection occurred on the last or any other day of the session, if done\r\nunder a misapprehension or mistake of the facts, the Senate, I doubt\r\nnot, will take equal pleasure in correcting the error.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 17, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 2d ultimo, requesting\r\ninformation in regard to the demarcation of the boundary line between\r\nthe United States and the Republic of Texas, I transmit a report from\r\nthe Secretary of State and the papers by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 17, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to submit the accompanying report and documents[27] from\r\nthe Postmaster-General, in compliance with the resolution of the Senate\r\nof the 16th February.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Statements of the quantity and cost of labor and materials\r\nfor the new public buildings in Washington, D.C., etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 23, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nA resolution adopted by the House of Representatives on the 16th\r\ninstant, in the following words, viz, \"_Resolved_, That the President of\r\nthe United States and the heads of the several Departments be requested\r\nto communicate to the House of Representatives the names of such of the\r\nmembers (if any) of the Twenty-sixth and Twenty-seventh Congresses who\r\nhave been applicants for office, and for what offices, distinguishing\r\nbetween those who have applied in person and those whose applications\r\nwere made by friends, whether in person or by writing,\" has been\r\ntransmitted to me for my consideration.\r\n\r\nIf it were consistent with the rights and duties of the executive\r\ndepartment, it would afford me great pleasure to furnish in this, as in\r\nall cases in which proper information is demanded, a ready compliance\r\nwith the wishes of the House of Representatives. But since, in my view,\r\ngeneral considerations of policy and propriety, as well as a proper\r\ndefense of the rights and safeguards of the executive department,\r\nrequire of me as the Chief Magistrate to refuse compliance with the\r\nterms of this resolution, it is incumbent on me to urge, for the\r\nconsideration of the House of Representatives, my reasons for declining\r\nto give the desired information.\r\n\r\nAll appointments to office made by a President become from the date of\r\ntheir nomination to the Senate official acts, which are matter of record\r\nand are at the proper time made known to the House of Representatives\r\nand to the country. But applications for office, or letters respecting\r\nappointments, or conversations held with individuals on such subjects\r\nare not official proceedings, and can not by any means be made to\r\npartake of the character of official proceedings unless after the\r\nnomination of such person so writing or conversing the President shall\r\nthink proper to lay such correspondence or such conversations before the\r\nSenate. Applications for office are in their very nature confidential,\r\nand if the reasons assigned for such applications or the names of the\r\napplicants were communicated, not only would such implied confidence be\r\nwantonly violated, but, in addition, it is quite obvious that a mass of\r\nvague, incoherent, and personal matter would be made public at a vast\r\nconsumption of time, money, and trouble without accomplishing or tending\r\nin any manner to accomplish, as it appears to me, any useful object\r\nconnected with a sound and constitutional administration of the\r\nGovernment in any of its branches.\r\n\r\nBut there is a consideration of a still more effective and lofty\r\ncharacter which is with me entirely decisive of the correctness of the\r\nview that I have taken of this question. While I shall ever evince the\r\ngreatest readiness to communicate to the House of Representatives all\r\nproper information which the House shall deem necessary to a due\r\ndischarge of its constitutional obligations and functions, yet it\r\nbecomes me, in defense of the Constitution and laws of the United\r\nStates, to protect the executive department from all encroachment on\r\nits powers, rights, and duties. In my judgment a compliance with the\r\nresolution which has been transmitted to me would be a surrender of\r\nduties and powers which the Constitution has conferred exclusively on\r\nthe Executive, and therefore such compliance can not be made by me nor\r\nby the heads of Departments by my direction. The appointing power, so\r\nfar as it is bestowed on the President by the Constitution, is conferred\r\nwithout reserve or qualification. The reason for the appointment and\r\nthe responsibility of the appointment rest with him alone. I can not\r\nperceive anywhere in the Constitution of the United States any right\r\nconferred on the House of Representatives to hear the reasons which an\r\napplicant may urge for an appointment to office under the executive\r\ndepartment, or any duty resting upon the House of Representatives by\r\nwhich it may become responsible for any such appointment.\r\n\r\nAny assumption or misapprehension on the part of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of its duties and powers in respect to appointments by\r\nwhich it encroaches on the rights and duties of the executive department\r\nis to the extent to which it reaches dangerous, impolitic, and\r\nunconstitutional.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, so perfectly convincing to my mind, I beg leave\r\nrespectfully to repeat, in conclusion, that I can not comply with the\r\nrequest contained in the above resolution.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 25, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the urgency with which I have on more than one occasion\r\nfelt it my duty to press upon Congress the necessity of providing the\r\nGovernment with the means of discharging its debts and maintaining\r\ninviolate the public faith, the increasing embarrassments of the\r\nTreasury impose upon me the indispensable obligation of again inviting\r\nyour most serious attention to the condition of the finances.\r\nFortunately for myself in thus bringing this important subject to your\r\nview for a deliberate and comprehensive examination in all its bearings,\r\nand I trust I may add for a final adjustment of it to the common\r\nadvantage of the whole Union, I am permitted to approach it with perfect\r\nfreedom and candor. As few of the burdens for which provision is now\r\nrequired to be made have been brought upon the country during my short\r\nadministration of its affairs, I have neither motive nor wish to make\r\nthem a matter of crimination against any of my predecessors. I am\r\ndisposed to regard, as I am bound to treat, them _as facts_ which can\r\nnot now be undone, and as deeply interesting to us all, and equally\r\nimposing upon all the most solemn duties; and the only use I would make\r\nof the errors of the past is by a careful examination of their causes\r\nand character to avoid if possible the repetition of them in future.\r\nThe condition of the country, indeed, is such as may well arrest the\r\nconflict of parties.\r\n\r\nThe conviction seems at length to have made its way to the minds of all\r\nthat the disproportion between the public responsibilities and the means\r\nprovided for meeting them is no casual nor transient evil. It is, on the\r\ncontrary, one which for some years to come, notwithstanding a resort to\r\nall reasonable retrenchments and the constant progress of the country\r\nin population and productive power, must continue to increase under\r\nexisting laws, unless we consent to give up or impair all our defenses\r\nin war and peace. But this is a thought which I am persuaded no\r\npatriotic mind would for a moment entertain. Without affecting an alarm,\r\nwhich I do not feel, in regard to our foreign relations, it may safely\r\nbe affirmed that they are in a state too critical and involve too many\r\nmomentous issues to permit us to neglect in the least, much less to\r\nabandon entirely, those means of asserting our rights without which\r\nnegotiation is without dignity and peace without security.\r\n\r\nIn the report of the Secretary of the Treasury submitted to Congress\r\nat the commencement of the present session it is estimated that after\r\nexhausting all the probable resources of the year there will remain a\r\ndeficit of about $14,000,000. With a view partly to a permanent system\r\nof revenue and partly to immediate relief from actual embarrassment,\r\nthat officer recommended, together with a plan for establishing a\r\nGovernment exchequer, some expedients of a more temporary character,\r\nviz, the issuing of Treasury notes and the extension of the time for\r\nwhich the loan authorized to be negotiated by the act of the last\r\nsession should be taken. Congress accordingly provided for an issue of\r\nTreasury notes to the amount of $5,000,000, but subject to the condition\r\nthat they should not be paid away below par.\r\n\r\nNo measure connected with the last of the two objects above mentioned\r\nwas introduced until recently into the House of Representatives. Should\r\nthe loan bill now pending before that body pass into a law for its\r\npresent amount, there would still remain a deficit of $2,500,000. It\r\nrequires no argument to show that such a condition of the Treasury is\r\nincompatible not only with a high state of public credit, but with\r\nanything approaching to efficiency in the conduct of public affairs.\r\nIt must be obvious even to the most inexperienced minds that, to say\r\nnothing of any particular exigency, actual or imminent, there should\r\nbe at all times in the Treasury of a great nation, with a view to\r\ncontingencies of ordinary occurrence, a surplus at least equal in amount\r\nto the above deficiency. But that deficiency, serious as it would be in\r\nitself, will, I am compelled to say, rather be increased than diminished\r\nwithout the adoption of measures adequate to correct the evil at once.\r\nThe stagnation of trade and business, in some degree incident to the\r\nderangement of the national finances and the state of the revenue laws,\r\nholds out but little prospect of relief, in the ordinary course of\r\nthings, for some time to come.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances I am deeply impressed with the necessity of\r\nmeeting the crisis with a vigor and decision which it imperatively\r\ndemands at the hands of all intrusted with the conduct of public\r\naffairs. The gravity of the evil calls for a remedy proportioned to it.\r\nNo slight palliatives or occasional expedients will give the country the\r\nrelief it needs. Such measures, on the contrary, will in the end, as is\r\nnow manifest to all, too surely multiply its embarrassments. Relying,\r\nas I am bound to do, on the representatives of a people rendered\r\nillustrious among nations by having paid off its whole public debt,\r\nI shall not shrink from the responsibility imposed upon me by the\r\nConstitution of pointing out such measures as will in my opinion insure\r\nadequate relief. I am the more encouraged to recommend the course which\r\nnecessity exacts by the confidence which I have in its complete success.\r\nThe resources of the country in everything that constitutes the wealth\r\nand strength of nations are so abundant, the spirit of a most\r\nindustrious, enterprising, and intelligent people is so energetic and\r\nelastic, that the Government will be without the shadow of excuse for\r\nits delinquency if the difficulties which now embarrass it be not\r\nspeedily and effectually removed.\r\n\r\nFrom present indications it is hardly doubtful that Congress will find\r\nit necessary to lay additional duties on imports in order to meet the\r\nordinary current expenses of the Government. In the exercise of a sound\r\ndiscrimination having reference to revenue, but at the same time\r\nnecessarily affording incidental protection to manufacturing industry,\r\nit seems equally probable that duties on some articles of importation\r\nwill have to be advanced above 20 per cent. In performing this important\r\nwork of revising the tariff of duties, which in the present emergency\r\nwould seem to be indispensable, I can not too strongly recommend the\r\ncultivation of a spirit of mutual harmony and concession, to which the\r\nGovernment itself owes its origin, and without the continued exercise of\r\nwhich jarring and discord would universally prevail.\r\n\r\nAn additional reason for the increase of duties in some instances beyond\r\nthe rate of 20 per cent will exist in fulfilling the recommendations\r\nalready made, and now repeated, of making adequate appropriations for\r\nthe defenses of the country.\r\n\r\nBy the express provision of the act distributing the proceeds of the\r\nsales of the public lands among the States its operation is _ipso facto_\r\nto cease so soon as the rate of the duties shall exceed the limits\r\nprescribed in the act.\r\n\r\nIn recommending the adoption of measures for distributing the proceeds\r\nof the public lands among the States at the commencement of the last\r\nsession of Congress such distribution was urged by arguments and\r\nconsiderations which appeared to me then and appear to me now of great\r\nweight, and was placed on the condition that it should not render\r\nnecessary any departure from the act of 1833. It is with sincere regret\r\nthat I now perceive the necessity of departing from that act, because I\r\nam well aware that expectations justly entertained by some of the States\r\nwill be disappointed by any occasion which shall withhold from them the\r\nproceeds of the lands. But the condition was plainly expressed in the\r\nmessage and was inserted in terms equally plain in the law itself, and\r\namidst the embarrassments which surround the country on all sides and\r\nbeset both the General and the State Governments it appears to me that\r\nthe object first and highest in importance is to establish the credit of\r\nthis Government and to place it on durable foundations, and thus afford\r\nthe most effectual support to the credit of the States, equal at least\r\nto what it would receive from a direct distribution of the proceeds of\r\nthe sales of the public lands.\r\n\r\nWhen the distribution law was passed there was reason to anticipate that\r\nthere soon would be a real surplus to distribute. On that assumption\r\nit was in my opinion a wise, a just, and a beneficent measure. But to\r\ncontinue it in force while there is no such surplus to distribute and\r\nwhen it is manifestly necessary not only to increase the duties, but at\r\nthe same time to borrow money in order to liquidate the public debt and\r\ndisembarrass the public Treasury, would cause it to be regarded as an\r\nunwise alienation of the best security of the public creditor, which\r\nwould with difficulty be excused and could not be justified.\r\n\r\nCauses of no ordinary character have recently depressed American credit\r\nin the stock market of the world to a degree quite unprecedented. I need\r\nscarcely mention the condition of the banking institutions of some of\r\nthe States, the vast amount of foreign debt contracted during a period\r\nof wild speculation by corporations and individuals, and, above all, the\r\nDoctrine of repudiation of contracts solemnly entered into by States,\r\nwhich, although as yet applied only under circumstances of a peculiar\r\ncharacter and generally rebuked with severity by the moral sense of the\r\ncommunity, is yet so very licentious and, in a Government depending\r\nwholly on opinion, so very alarming that the impression made by it to\r\nour disadvantage as a people is anything but surprising. Under such\r\ncircumstances it is imperatively due from us to the people whom we\r\nrepresent that when we go into the money market to contract a loan we\r\nshould tender such securities as to cause the money lender, as well at\r\nhome as abroad, to feel that the most propitious opportunity is afforded\r\nhim of investing profitably and judiciously his capital. A government\r\nwhich has paid off the debts of two wars, waged with the most powerful\r\nnation of modern times, should not be brought to the necessity of\r\nchaffering for terms in the money market. Under such circumstances as I\r\nhave adverted to our object should be to produce with the capitalist a\r\nfeeling of entire confidence, by a tender of that sort of security which\r\nin all times past has been esteemed sufficient, and which for the small\r\namount of our proposed indebtedness will unhesitatingly be regarded as\r\namply adequate. While a pledge of all the revenues amounts to no more\r\nthan is implied in every instance when the Government contracts a\r\ndebt, and although it ought in ordinary circumstances to be entirely\r\nsatisfactory, yet in times like these the capitalist would feel better\r\nsatisfied with the pledge of a specific fund, ample in magnitude to the\r\npayment of his interest and ultimate reimbursement of his principal.\r\nSuch is the character of the land fund. The most vigilant money dealer\r\nwill readily perceive that not only will his interest be secure on\r\nsuch a pledge, but that a debt of $18,000,000 or $20,000,000 would by\r\nthe surplus of sales over and above the payment of the interest be\r\nextinguished within any reasonable time fixed for its redemption.\r\nTo relieve the Treasury from its embarrassments and to aid in meeting\r\nits requisitions until time is allowed for any new tariff of duties\r\nto become available, it would seem to be necessary to fund a debt\r\napproaching to $15,000,000; and in order to place the negotiation of the\r\nloan beyond a reasonable doubt I submit to Congress whether the proceeds\r\nof the sales of the public lands should not be pledged for the payment\r\nof the interest, and the Secretary of the Treasury be authorized out of\r\nthe surplus of the proceeds of such sales to purchase the stock, when it\r\ncan be procured on such terms as will render it beneficial in that way,\r\nto extinguish the debt and prevent the accumulation of such surplus\r\nwhile its distribution is suspended.\r\n\r\nNo one can doubt that were the Federal Treasury now as prosperous as it\r\nwas ten years ago and its fiscal operations conducted by an efficient\r\nagency of its own, coextensive with the Union, the embarrassments of the\r\nStates and corporations in them would produce, even if they continued as\r\nthey are (were that possible), effects far less disastrous than those\r\nnow experienced. It is the disorder here, at the heart and center of the\r\nsystem, that paralyzes and deranges every part of it. Who does not know\r\nthe permanent importance, not to the Federal Government alone, but to\r\nevery State and every individual within its jurisdiction, even in their\r\nmost independent and isolated individual pursuits, of the preservation\r\nof a sound state of public opinion and a judicious administration here?\r\nThe sympathy is instantaneous and universal. To attempt to remedy the\r\nevil of the deranged credit and currency of the States while the disease\r\nis allowed to rage in the vitals of this Government would be a hopeless\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nIt is the full conviction of this truth which emboldens me most\r\nearnestly to recommend to your early and serious consideration the\r\nmeasures now submitted to your better judgment, as well as those to\r\nwhich your attention has been already invited. The first great want of\r\nthe country, that without answering which all attempts at bettering\r\nthe present condition of things will prove fruitless, is a complete\r\nrestoration of the credit and finances of the Federal Government.\r\nThe source and foundation of all credit is in the confidence which the\r\nGovernment inspires, and just in proportion as that confidence shall\r\nbe shaken or diminished will be the distrust among all classes of the\r\ncommunity and the derangement and demoralization in every branch of\r\nbusiness and all the interests of the country. Keep up the standard of\r\ngood faith and punctuality in the operations of the General Government,\r\nand all partial irregularities and disorders will be rectified by\r\nthe influence of its example; but suffer that standard to be debased\r\nor disturbed, and it is impossible to foresee to what a degree of\r\ndegradation and confusion all financial interests, public and private,\r\nmay sink. In such a country as this the representatives of the people\r\nhave only to will it, and the public credit will be as high as it ever\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nMy own views of the measures calculated to effect this great and\r\ndesirable object I have thus frankly expressed to Congress under\r\ncircumstances which give to the entire subject a peculiar and solemn\r\ninterest. The Executive can do no more. If the credit of the country be\r\nexposed to question, if the public defenses be broken down or weakened,\r\nif the whole administration of public affairs be embarrassed for want of\r\nthe necessary means for conducting them with vigor and effect, I trust\r\nthat this department of the Government will be found to have done all\r\nthat was in its power to avert such evils, and will be acquitted of all\r\njust blame on account of them.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 25, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor herewith to submit a report[28] from the Secretary of\r\nthe Navy, in compliance with your resolution of the 18th February, 1842.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Transmitting list of agents, etc., employed by the Navy\r\nDepartment without express authority of law, etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 30, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives two extracts from a note\r\nof the chargé d'affaires of the Republic of Texas accredited to this\r\nGovernment to the Department of State, one suggesting in behalf of his\r\nGovernment such modifications of the existing laws of the United States\r\nas will impart greater facility to the trade between the two countries,\r\nparticularly to that which passes across their frontier, and the other\r\nexpressing a desire for some regulation on the part of this Government\r\nby means of which the communication by post between the United States\r\nand Texas may be improved.\r\n\r\nAs the wishes of the Texan Government in relation to those subjects can\r\nonly be gratified by means of laws to be passed by Congress, they are\r\naccordingly referred to the consideration of the two Houses.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[The same message was sent to the Senate.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 1, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn part compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 20th of July,\r\n1841, I transmit herewith a report[29] from the Department of War.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Transmitting list of removals from and appointments to\r\noffice in the Department of War from March 4, 1829, to September 30,\r\n1841.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 1, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with your resolution of the 21st of March, I have the\r\nhonor to submit the accompanying communication[30] from the Secretary\r\nof the Navy.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: Relating to appointments to office in the Navy and Marine\r\nCorps since April 4, 1841.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 4, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_.\r\n\r\nIn part compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives\r\nof the 21st March, 1842, I herewith communicate a report[31] from the\r\nSecretary of State.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Transmitting list of appointments by the President or\r\nSecretary of State since April 4, 1841.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 7, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives copies of a letter\r\naddressed to the Secretary of State by the chairman of the board of\r\ncommissioners appointed to explore and survey the boundary line between\r\nthe States of Maine and New Hampshire and the adjoining British\r\nProvinces, together with the report of the operations of that commission\r\nto the 31st ultimo, and a profile of the meridian line from the source\r\nof the St. Croix River as far as surveyed, illustrative of the report.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[The same message was sent to the Senate.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, March 31, 1842_.\r\n\r\nHon.

The report of the operations of the commission up to the present\r\ndate.\r\n\r\n2. A profile of the meridian line of the source of the St. Croix as far\r\nas surveyed, intended to illustrate the report.\r\n\r\n3. A portfolio of drawings intended for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n4.

RENWICK,\r\n  _Chairman_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Report of the commissioners appointed by the President of the United\r\nStates for the purpose of surveying and exploring the boundary line\r\nbetween the States of Maine and New Hampshire and the British\r\nProvinces_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 28,1842_.\r\n\r\nHon. DANIEL WEBSTER,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\nSIR: The duties assigned to the undersigned by the instructions of your\r\npredecessor were twofold:\r\n\r\nFirst. To explore and survey the lines respectively claimed by the\r\nGovernments of the United States and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nSecond. To examine and report upon the arguments contained in the report\r\nof Messrs. Featherstonhaugh and Mudge addressed to the secretary of\r\nstate of Her Britannic Majesty for foreign affairs under date of 16th\r\nApril, 1840.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nIn order to the more exact and successful performance of the duties\r\nincluded under the first of the above heads, the boundary line was\r\ndivided by their instructions into three separate portions, one of\r\nwhich was assigned to each of the commissioners; and while they were\r\ninstructed to assemble in a board for the purpose of comparing their\r\nrespective surveys, in view of the performance of the duties included\r\nin the second of the above divisions their explorations have been\r\nseparately conducted. Each of the commissioners has employed the methods\r\nand course of action most appropriate in his opinion to the successful\r\nfulfillment of his appointed task, and the nature of the surveys\r\nassigned to one of them has been of a character widely different from\r\nthose of his colleagues. The commissioners, therefore, while uniting in\r\na general report of the progress made up to this time in the duties of\r\ntheir appointment, beg leave to submit, in the form of appendices, the\r\nnarrative of their several operations, with so much of the records\r\nof their observations and calculations as they have severally judged\r\nnecessary to authenticate the conclusions at which they have arrived.\r\n\r\nThe progress which has been made in the labors of the commissioners\r\nenables them at this time to lay before you--\r\n\r\n1. A description of the physical features of the disputed territory.\r\n\r\n2. A comparison of the heights of the line claimed by the United States\r\nwith those of the line styled the \"axis of maximum elevation\" by Messrs.\r\nFeatherstonhaugh and Mudge. In laying the latter before you they have,\r\nin order to avoid delay, made use in part of the published results\r\nobtained by those gentlemen, and although they have already detected\r\nerrors in their inferences they do not consider that by accepting them\r\nfor the moment as the basis of comparison they can be accused of\r\nexhibiting the line claimed by Great Britain in an unfavorable light.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--DESCRIPTION OF THE DISPUTED TERRITORY.\r\n\r\nThe seacoast of the State of Maine is rugged and hilly. The primitive\r\nrocks of which its geological structure is chiefly composed are broken\r\ninto ridges which run parallel to the great streams, and therefore in a\r\ndirection from north to south. These ridges terminate in an irregular\r\nline, which to the east of the Penobscot may be identified nearly with\r\nthe military road to Houlton. From the northern summit of these ridges\r\nan extensive view of the disputed territory can in many places be\r\nobtained. This is the case at the military post at Houlton, whence a\r\nwide extent of country may be seen. A still more perfect view may be\r\nobtained from the summit of Parks Hill, at a point about 400 yards south\r\nof the road from Houlton to Woodstock and about half a mile east of the\r\nexploring meridian line. At the time when that line was run by the\r\nBritish and American surveyors, under the fifth article of the treaty of\r\nGhent, the top of this hill was covered with wood, and they were obliged\r\nto content themselves with the view from Park's barn, which is at least\r\n200 feet beneath the summit. At the present moment the latter is\r\ncleared, and the view from west-southwest to northeast is unimpeded\r\nexcept by a single clump of trees, which cuts off the view for a few\r\ndegrees in the northwest direction; but by a change of position every\r\npart of the horizon between these points is to be seen. Toward the west\r\nare seen ridges parallel to the Penobscot, over which Katahdin towers to\r\na great height, bearing by compass N. 85° W. In a direction N. 75° W.\r\nare seen two distant peaks, one of which was identified as the\r\nTraveller. All of these eminences lie south of the line claimed by Great\r\nBritain. In the north-northwest direction there appear two ridges of\r\ncomparatively small elevation, which were pointed out as the Aroostook\r\nMountains, but have since been ascertained to lie near the sources of\r\nthe Meduxnikeag. These lie in the line claimed by Great Britain in 1817.\r\n\r\nBetween these and the other mountains there is evidently no connection,\r\nand the rest of the country, as seen from the hill, bears the aspect\r\nof a wooded plain. It will be sufficient to refer to this view to be\r\nsatisfied that all the impressions which have been circulated of a\r\ncontinuous chain of elevations extending along the line claimed by\r\nGreat Britain are utterly fallacious.\r\n\r\nToward the north the country exhibits the same general features. One\r\nvast and apparently unbroken plain extends to the utmost limits of the\r\nvisible horizon. In the midst of this, and at a distance of nearly 30\r\nmiles, Mars Hill alone breaks the monotonous prospect, and from its\r\nisolated position assumes to the eye an importance to which its altitude\r\nof less than 1,800 feet would not otherwise entitle it. No other\r\neminences are to be seen in this direction, except a round peak bearing\r\na few degrees west of north and some distant ridges about an equal\r\ndistance to the east. The first of these has been ascertained by the\r\nsurveys of Major Graham to be an isolated hill near the peak known as\r\nQuaquajo. The eastern ridges are probably those measured between the\r\nTobique and the Bay of Chaleurs by the British commissioners. A sketch\r\nof this view from Parks Hill is annexed to the report, and lest any\r\ndoubt be entertained of its accuracy it is proper to state that the\r\nunassisted vision was not relied upon, but that the outlines were\r\ncarefully delineated by means of the camera lucida.\r\n\r\nFrom this view it might be inferred that the northern part of the\r\nadmitted possessions of the United States to the east of the Penobscot\r\nand the disputed territory as far as visible constitute a vast\r\ntable-land slightly inclined toward the southeast.\r\n\r\nOn descending into the valley of the St. John the appearances change.\r\nThe tableland is cut to a great depth by that stream, and from its bed\r\nthe broken edges of the great plain look like ridges whose height is\r\nexaggerated to the senses in consequence of their being densely clothed\r\nwith wood. The same is the case with all the branches of this river,\r\nwhich also cut the table-land to greater or less depths according to\r\ntheir distance from the stream into which they discharge themselves.\r\n\r\nThe want of a true highland or mountainous character in this region is\r\nobvious from the aspect it presents in the two different points of view.\r\nMountainous regions are most imposing when seen from a distance and from\r\nheights. On a nearer approach, and from the valleys which intersect\r\nthem, the elevations, so important in the distant view, are hidden\r\nby their own slopes or lose the appearance of relative elevation in\r\nconsequence of the absolute heights of the valleys themselves. In\r\nconformity with this character, the line claimed by the United States\r\nfor the most part presents, when seen at a distance, the appearance of\r\nlofty and deeply serrated ridges, while to one who traverses it it is a\r\nlabyrinth of lakes, morasses, and short but steep elevations which hide\r\nits peaks from the valleys and streams.\r\n\r\nThe line claimed by Great Britain, on the other hand, when seen from\r\na distance is as level as the surface of the ocean, with no greater\r\nappearance of elevation and depression than would represent its billows;\r\nwhile, seen from its own valleys, the heights assume an importance which\r\ntheir elevation above the valleys when actually measured does not\r\nwarrant. The characteristics of the region through which the line of\r\nMessrs. Mudge and Featherstonhaugh passes are therefore the opposite of\r\nthose usually remarked in highland countries, while those of the line\r\nclaimed by the United States are the same as are always observed in\r\nsuch regions.\r\n\r\nThis character of a table-land deeply cut by streams is well exhibited\r\nin the section of their \"axis of maximum elevation\" by the British\r\ncommissioners. In that will be seen the mountains near the source of the\r\nAroostook, Alleguash, and Penobscot on the one hand, and of the Tobique\r\non the other, while the intervening space is occupied by a curve\r\nresembling an inverted arch, of which the St. John occupies the\r\nkeystone. In a country of this character any line whatever would present\r\nthe appearance of a succession of eminences, and might by as liberal a\r\nconstruction of the term as has been made by Messrs. Mudge and\r\nFeatherstonhaugh be called highlands.\r\n\r\nThe sameness of this general character is broken only by a single chain\r\nof hills.[32] This is a prolongation of Mars Hill toward the north, and,\r\nbeing both of less height and breadth than that mountain, is hidden by\r\nit from the view of a spectator on Parks Hill. Mars Hill is itself an\r\nisolated eminence, and is in fact nearly an island, for the Presque Isle\r\nand Gissiguit rivers, running the one to the north and the other to the\r\nsouth of it, have branches which take their rise in the same swamp on\r\nits northwestern side. To the north of the Des Chutes the ground again\r\nrises, and although cut by several streams, and particularly by the\r\nAroostook, the chain is prolonged by isolated eminences as far as the\r\nWhite Rapids, below the Grand Falls of the St. John, where it crosses\r\nthat river. It may thence be traced in a northern direction to the Sugar\r\nLoaf Mountain, on the Wagansis portage, where it terminates.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: A chain is made up of mountains whose bases touch each\r\nother.--BALBI.]\r\n\r\nTo this broken chain belongs the elevation of 918 feet given by Messrs.\r\nMudge and Featherstonhaugh to an eminence in the neighborhood of the\r\nAroostook Falls. An accurate profile of so many of these eminences as\r\nfall in the line of the connected meridian is herewith submitted. This\r\nchain of eminences is not prolonged to the westward, as it is entirely\r\nunconnected with any other height aspiring to the name of mountain in\r\nthat direction.\r\n\r\nIt is not in any sense a dividing ridge, being cut by all the streams in\r\nthe country, and in particular to a great depth by the St. John and the\r\nAroostook.\r\n\r\nA section of this line was given in a report to the British commissioner\r\nunder the fifth article of the treaty of Ghent by Colonel Bouchette, the\r\nsurveyor-general of the Province of Canada. His heights were determined\r\nby the barometer, and estimated from the assumed level of the monument\r\nat the source of the St. Croix.\r\n\r\nIt would now appear that the section of Colonel Bouchette is very\r\ninaccurate, and that the heights as reported by him are not only much\r\nbeyond the truth, but that the continually ascending slope ascribed by\r\nhim to the country from the monument at the source of the St. Croix to\r\nthe point where the due north line crosses the St. John is entirely\r\nerroneous. He, however, adroitly availed himself of this inaccurate\r\nsection to attempt to prove the existence of a continuous chain of\r\nmountains from Katahdin to the Great Falls of the St. John, and thence\r\naround the southwestern branches of the Restigouche until it met the\r\nheights rising from the north shore of the Bay of Chaleurs. For this\r\nreason his view taken from Park's barn and that made by Mr. Odell from\r\nthe same point were urged for admission as evidence on oath by the\r\nBritish agent, and the map of Mr. Johnson, which contradicted this\r\nevidence, was carefully excluded. It can not be concealed that could\r\nColonel Bouchette's idea founded on erroneous premises have been\r\nestablished by indisputable facts it would have been the most fatal\r\nargument that has ever been adduced against the American claim, for he\r\nwould have argued that the meridian line of the St. Croix would at Mars\r\nHill have first intersected highlands which, rising from the north shore\r\nof the Bay of Chaleurs, would have appeared to divide until within a few\r\nmiles of the Grand Falls of the St. John waters which fall into the St.\r\nLawrence from those which fall into the Atlantic, and would have been\r\nthe south boundary of the Province of Quebec.\r\n\r\nMars Hill would then have appeared to be in truth as well as in claim\r\nthe northwest angle of the Province of Nova Scotia; and although the\r\nrest of the line would not have fulfilled the conditions, the United\r\nStates might by an arbitrator have been compelled to accept this point\r\nas the beginning of their boundary. Nor, in the unexplored state of the\r\ncountry, is it by any means certain that the American agent, who does\r\nnot seem to have seen the drift of the proceedings of Colonel Bouchette,\r\nwould have been prepared with the adverse facts, which are now known to\r\nbe undeniable. It may therefore be considered fortunate for the claim of\r\nthe United States that the survey was afterwards intrusted to a surveyor\r\nwho, in pursuit of the double object of encroachment on the United\r\nStates and the enlargement of his native Province at the expense of\r\nCanada, signally failed in the proof of either of his positions.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge now acquired shows that the idea of Colonel Bouchette is\r\nunsupported by the facts of the case, for the highlands which rise from\r\nthe north shore of the Bay of Chaleurs do not meet those in which the\r\nmost southerly branch of the Restigouche takes its rise.\r\n\r\nThe British commissioners, although they give a profile of this ridge,\r\ndo not pretend to have examined it except at Mars Hill, near the\r\nAroostook, and at the Grand Falls of the St. John. It must be remarked\r\nthat these profiles (the original one of Colonel Bouchette and that\r\nexhibited by themselves) are contrasted--one British authority with\r\nanother--for the purpose of invalidating the ground on which the\r\nAmerican claim is founded.\r\n\r\nIt is not our business to reconcile these conflicting authorities, but\r\nit is our duty to recall the recollections of the fact that no part\r\nof the American argument laid before the King of the Netherlands was\r\nfounded on this or any other estimate of heights. Many elevations,\r\nindeed, were measured with great pains on the part of the Americans\r\nas well as of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the United States Captain Partridge made many barometric\r\nobservations, while Mr. Johnson took an extensive series of vertical\r\nand horizontal angles. His operations were performed in the presence of\r\nMr. Odell, the surveyor on behalf of Great Britain, who doubtless made\r\nsimilar ones, as he visited the same stations with a better instrument\r\nand for the same avowed purpose. Mr. Odell's observations were not\r\npresented by the British agent, and those of Mr. Johnson were objected\r\nto. If received, they would have set aside the pretensions that a\r\ncontinuous ridge of mountains existed between the Metjarmette portage\r\nand Mars Hill. They are, however, superseded by the operations of the\r\nundersigned, which have yielded satisfactory evidence that no chain of\r\nhighlands in the sense of the British commissioners, or even an \"axis of\r\nmaximum elevation,\" exists where it is laid down on their map. Nor can\r\nit be doubted that the operations of Mr. Johnson had a decided advantage\r\nin point of probable accuracy over theirs. The exploring meridian line\r\nused as a base was measured with a tolerable degree of accuracy, and\r\nfrom the three heights chosen by him the whole country is visible.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the course of Messrs. Mudge and Featherstonhaugh\r\nbeing confined, except where they ascended Mars Hill, to the valleys of\r\nthe streams, they were for the most part excluded from a prospect. In\r\ndescribing the view from Mars Hill, however, they have pictured in most\r\naccurate terms the true features of the country:\r\n\r\n\"The character of the country may be well discerned and understood from\r\nthis insulated hill. It presents to the eye one mass of dark and gloomy\r\nforest to the utmost limits of sight, covering by its umbrageous mantle\r\nthe principal rivers, minor streams, and scanty vestiges of the\r\nhabitation of man.\"\r\n\r\nThis description can only agree with that of a vast table-land into\r\nwhich the streams cut so deep and form such narrow valleys as to be\r\ninvisible.\r\n\r\nBut if a chain of highlands, or even an \"axis of maximum elevation,\"\r\nhad existed as they lay it down, within 20 miles, it would have been\r\nvisible, and it need not be said that they would not have failed to\r\ndescribe it. The inconsistency between their map and this true and\r\nforcible description of the features of the country is apparent.\r\n\r\nThe same general character of table-land is found to the north of the\r\nSt. John above the Grand Falls. Its first important northern tributary\r\nis the Grand River. In ascending this stream the level of the table-land\r\nis soon reached. The river runs between banks of very moderate elevation\r\nand on a regular slope, and although running with great rapidity upon a\r\npebbly bed it is yet so tortuous that while its distance from its mouth\r\nto the Wagansis portage in a straight line is no more than 13 miles the\r\nmeanders of its channel amount to 30.\r\n\r\nOn the Wagansis portage the table-land is terminated by a ridge whose\r\nsummit is elevated 264 feet above the wagansis[33] of Grand River. It\r\nwas at first believed that this, although of small elevation, was a\r\ndividing ridge, and that it might correspond to one construction which\r\nhas, although inaccurately, been put on the treaty of 1783. This belief\r\nwas speedily removed, for the rivulet on its northern side was found to\r\nbe cut off from the Restigouche by the Sugar Loaf Mountain, and is\r\ntherefore a branch either of the Grand River or of the stream which\r\nfalls into the St. John immediately above the Grand Falls. The height of\r\nland which divides this rivulet from the wagan of the Restigouche is not\r\nelevated above the former more than 117 feet. There is, in fact, at this\r\nplace a gap 5 or 6 miles in breadth in the great system of mountains\r\nwhich extend from the Gulf of St. Lawrence at the Bay des Chaleurs to\r\nthe river St. Lawrence near the Temiscouata portage. At the northern\r\nverge of the table-land which has been described, and near the mouth of\r\nGreen River, rises to the height of about 1,600 feet a mountain known\r\nfrom the name of that stream. This is, like Mars Hill, isolated, and\r\naffords an extensive view. To the north and west the prospect is bounded\r\nby a continuous line of horizon, which, instead of being obviously below\r\nthe level of the eye, as in the view of the disputed territory from Mars\r\nHill, is evidently of even greater height than the Green River Mountain\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Wagan is a term in the Abenaki language signifying way.\r\nSis is a diminutive particle. Wagansis is therefore the little way; and\r\nit seems probable that the name of Grand River, the usual epithet for\r\nthe St. John, has been improperly applied to the small stream which\r\nbears it on the map.]\r\n\r\nOn entering into this region from the south by any of the navigable\r\nstreams which traverse it, it presents a more decidedly mountainous\r\ncharacter than the country to the south. The Grande Fourche of\r\nRestigouche is bordered by two continuous chains of mountains, rising\r\nwhen it first issues from them to the height of a thousand feet above\r\nits surface. The stream having a rapid fall, the relative elevation\r\nbecomes less until, in the neighborhood of the lake in which its north\r\nbranch first collects its waters, the relative elevation is not more\r\nthan four or five hundred feet.\r\n\r\nOn traversing this elevated country it presents a different aspect from\r\nwhat is seen either from a distance or where it is entered from the\r\nrivers. Frequent ridges are crossed; the tops of these are often\r\noccupied by swamps filled with a thick growth of cedars. Deep and small\r\nbasins occur, which are occupied by lakes that give rise to rivers\r\nflowing to the St. Lawrence or to the St. John. These are intermingled\r\nwith thickets of dwarf spruce, and the streams are sometimes bordered\r\nby marshes covered by low alders, and sometimes cut deep into rocky\r\nchannels. In this apparent labyrinth one positive circumstance marks the\r\nline of division, or the true height of land: The streams which run to\r\nthe St. John are all of the first description--sluggish--while those\r\nwhich discharge themselves into the St. Lawrence are rapid, and have the\r\ncharacter of torrents.\r\n\r\nOn the western side of the disputed territory are ridges of rocky\r\nhills running nearly north and south, and thus tending toward the\r\nSt. Lawrence, which they in some places reach and shut out the view\r\nof the interior.\r\n\r\nIt thus becomes difficult to find a station whence the heights of land\r\ncan be viewed and its character exhibited. It has therefore been\r\nhitherto possible for those who have argued in support of the claims\r\nof Great Britain to represent without meeting with contradiction that\r\nthe streams which fall into the St. John had their rise in a country\r\npossessed of none of that mountainous character which they urged was\r\nessential to the epithet of highlands. There are, however, points where\r\na different character is apparent, and some of these are easy of access.\r\nThus, on the main mail road, along the Southeast Branch of the St.\r\nLawrence a mile northeast of the church of L'Islette, a rocky eminence\r\nis passed, whence may be seen a bold group of mountains which have been\r\nidentified with the sources of the Ouelle, the Kamouraska, and Black\r\nrivers. A view of this group is herewith presented.\r\n\r\nFrom the height to the east of river Du Loup a view may be seen on a\r\nclear day extending round 137° of the horizon, beginning with the\r\nhighlands of Bic, bearing N. 58° E., and terminating in a conical\r\nmountain bearing S. 15° W.\r\n\r\nThe nearest and more conspicuous of these highlands (named those of St.\r\nAndre) are on the river Fourche, a branch of the river Du Loup, whose\r\nwaters they divide from those of the St. Francis. A view of these is\r\nalso submitted herewith.\r\n\r\nA similar view of the same panorama of highlands is obtained from Hare\r\nIsland, in the St. Lawrence, an outline of which, taken with the camera\r\nlucida, is likewise submitted. About a quarter of a mile to the south\r\nof the point where the Temiscouata portage crosses Mount Biort the\r\nhighlands may be seen at the head of Rimouski, bearing nearly east,\r\nthence extending round by the north to the mountains of St. Andre,\r\nbearing nearly west, forming about one-half of the entire horizon.\r\nThe entire panorama from the latter point, taken with the camera\r\nlucida, along with copies of some daguerreotypes made at the same place,\r\nare herewith submitted. Of the part of the line which extends to the\r\nnortheast from the source of the Etchemin for a distance of many miles,\r\na view may be almost constantly seen from the citadel of Quebec and from\r\nthe tops of the houses in that city. One still more satisfactory may be\r\nobtained from the road between Quebec and the Falls of Montmorency, in\r\nthe neighborhood of the village of Belport. The latter views are in\r\nparticular referred to, as they are within the reach of numerous civil\r\nand military officers of the British Government, who must assent to the\r\nevidence of their own senses, which will prove that this region, the\r\nposition of the path pursued during the present year by Captain\r\nTalcott's parties, is to all intents a range of highlands.\r\n\r\nThe boundary presents from these positions the aspect of a continuous\r\nand deeply serrated ridge.\r\n\r\nThe geological character of the country can not be admitted as having\r\nany bearing upon the subject under consideration. It never entered into\r\nthe views of the framers of the treaty of 1783, and therefore could\r\nafford no illustrations of their intentions.\r\n\r\nWere it admissible, however, it might be cited as an additional argument\r\nthat the dividing height which incloses the waters of the Connecticut\r\ncontinues unchanged in its features until it is cut off by the deep\r\nchannel of the St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\nOpportunities for observations of this character were most frequent on\r\nthe Temiscouata portage and on the banks of the St. Lawrence itself. It\r\nwas only on the former place that the relative geological heights of the\r\nrocks could be observed by means of their outcrop.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the portage passes over stratified rocks dipping rapidly to\r\nthe southeast. They were found to be alternate groups of common and\r\ntalcose slate and of a rock made up principally of angular fragments of\r\nwhite quartz (grauwacke). These are in all respects identical with rocks\r\nwhich have been observed by one of the commissioners in place in\r\nBerkshire County, Mass., and in Columbia and Rensselaer counties, N.Y.,\r\nand the description of geologists at various intervening points, as well\r\nas the observations of Captain Talcott's parties, would tend to\r\nestablish the fact that the formations are continuous.\r\n\r\nFrom these data it would appear probable that the rocks are a\r\nprolongation of the western slope of the great range called by Mr.\r\nFeatherstonhaugh, in his report as United States geologist, the Atlantic\r\nridge. This formation, which is but a few miles in width where it\r\ncrosses the Hudson, appears gradually to widen as it proceeds to the\r\nnorth, and was on the St. Lawrence found to prevail both at the river\r\nDu Loup and at Grand Metis, dipping in the two places in opposite\r\ndirections and covered in the interval by the thick diluvial deposits\r\nwhich form the valley of the Trois Pistoles. To render the analogy more\r\ncomplete, in the valley of the outlet of the Little Lake (Temiscouata)\r\nwas found a vein of metalliferous quartz charged with peroxide of iron,\r\nevidently arising from the decomposition of pyrites, being in fact the\r\nsame as the matrix of the gold which has been traced in the talcose\r\nslate formation from Georgia to Vermont; and on the western shore of the\r\nTemiscouata Lake, about a mile to the south of Fort Ingall, lie great\r\nmasses of granular carbonate of lime, identically resembling the white\r\nmarbles of Pennsylvania, Westchester County, N.Y., and Berkshire County,\r\nMass.\r\n\r\nIf the latter be in place, which, although probable, was not ascertained\r\nbeyond all question, the primitive carbonate of lime has exactly the\r\nsame relation to the slaty rocks which it bears in the latter locality.\r\n\r\nThe formations which have been spoken of appear to occupy the whole\r\nextent of the country explored by the parties of Professor Renwick.\r\nEverywhere the streams were found cutting through rocks of slate. On\r\nthe summits of many of the hills were found weathered masses of angular\r\nquartz rocks, showing that while the slate had yielded to the action of\r\nthe elements, the harder and less friable rock had kept its place. The\r\nridges which intervene between the St. Lawrence at the river Du Loup\r\nand Lake Temiscouata have the character, so well described by Élie de\r\nBeaumont, of mountains elevated by some internal force.\r\n\r\nTo the eastward of Lake Temiscouata, on the other hand, the country has\r\nthe aspect of having once been a table-land, elevated on the average\r\nabout 1,700 feet above the level of the sea, and of having been washed\r\nby some mighty flood, which, wearing away the softer rocks, had cut it\r\ninto valleys, forming a complex system incapable of being described in\r\nwords and only to be understood by inspection of a map.\r\n\r\n2.--COMPARISON OF THE ELEVATIONS OF THE BOUNDARY LINE CLAIMED BY THE\r\nUNITED STATES WITH THOSE OF THE \"AXIS OF MAXIMUM ELEVATION\" OF MESSRS.\r\nFEATHERSTONHAUGH AND MUDGE.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of exhibiting the relative claims of the two lines to\r\nthe exclusive epithet of \"the highlands\" in the most clear and definite\r\nmanner, each of them will be considered as divided into three portions,\r\nwhich will be contrasted with each other by pairs The first portion\r\nof each of the lines is that which lies nearest to the point of\r\nbifurcation, the residue of the American line is divided at the source\r\nof the Ouelle, the remainder of the line of Messrs. Featherstonhaugh and\r\nMudge at that of the Aroostook Metjarmette portage is taken as the point\r\nof bifurcation, whence waters run to the Penobscot, the St. John, and\r\nthe St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n  On the American line from the Metjarmette portage\r\n  to Lake Etchemm--                                                Feet\r\n    The maximum height is                                         1,718\r\n    The minimum height is                                         1,218\r\n\r\n\r\nThe minimum measured height is that of Lake Etchemm, which is lower\r\nthan the actual source of that stream, and whose omission as not upon\r\nthe dividing ridge would make the minimum greater. This height was\r\ndetermined by the parties of A. Talcott, esq, by two distinct and\r\nseparate sets of observations, one of which was continued hourly for\r\nseveral days, and no doubt can exist that it is as accurate a measure\r\nas the barometer is capable of affording. In the report of Messrs.\r\nFeatherstonhaugh and Mudge this height is set down as no more than\r\n957 feet, but it is determined from a single observation. That it is\r\nerroneous must be considered as demonstrated. In the map presented by\r\nthose gentlemen they have made use of this erroneous determination for a\r\npurpose which, even were it correct, would not be warranted, for they on\r\nits authority leave out all the symbols by which heights are represented,\r\nand substitute therefore a dotted line with the inscription \"Fictitious\r\nhills of Mr. Burnham's map.\" The actual character of this part of the\r\nAmerican line is an undulating country.\r\n\r\n\r\n  On the line of Messrs. Featherstonhaugh and Mudge between\r\n  the Metjarmette portage and the Cocumgamoc Mountains--           Feet\r\n    The maximum elevation is                                      2,302\r\n    The minimum elevation is                                        987\r\n\r\n\r\nThis part of the line of Messrs. Featherstonhaugh and Mudge derives its\r\napparent advantage from the fact that it crosses the summit and occupies\r\nthe eastern slope of the highlands claimed by the United States.\r\nNotwithstanding this, the difference in their elevation is not such as\r\nto give it any decided superiority in its highland character.\r\n\r\n\r\n  On the American line from Lake Etchemm to the river Ouelle--     Feet\r\n    The maximum height is                                         2,854\r\n    The minimum height is                                         1,306\r\n\r\n  On the line of Messrs Featherstonhaugh and Mudge from the\r\n  Cocumgamoc Mountains to the head waters of the Aroostook--\r\n    The maximum height is                                         1,268\r\n    The minimum height is                                           880\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the parts of the line thus contrasted the maximum height of that\r\nclaimed by Great Britain is less elevated than the lowest gap of that\r\nclaimed by the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n  On the third portion of the American line\r\n\r\n  From the head of the Ouelle to the Temiscouata portage--         Feet\r\n    The maximum height is                                         2,231\r\n    The minimum height is                                           853\r\n\r\n  From the point where the line first crosses the Temiscouata\r\n  portage to Mount Paradis--\r\n    The maximum height is                                         1,983\r\n    The minimum height is                                           906\r\n\r\n  From the Temiscouata portage to the head of the Abagusquash--\r\n    The maximum height is                                         1,510\r\n    The minimum height is                                           676\r\n\r\n  From Abagusquash to the Rimouski Lake--\r\n    The maximum height is                                         1,824\r\n    The minimum height is                                           651\r\n\r\n  From the Rimouski Lake to the northwest angle--\r\n    The maximum height is                                         1,841\r\n    The minimum height is                                         1,014\r\n\r\n  The greatest elevation of the whole of the third part of the\r\n  American line, therefore, is                                    2,231\r\n  The minimum is                                                    651\r\n\r\n\r\nThe termination of the exploring meridian line falls into this part\r\nof the American line. Its height of 1,519 feet was determined by two\r\nseparate observations, compared with others taken on Lake Johnson.\r\nThe height of the latter was calculated at 1,007 feet from a series\r\nof observations continued for seventeen days, and is believed to be\r\nas accurate as the method of the barometer is susceptible of.\r\n\r\nThis height of the termination of that line is estimated by Messrs.\r\nFeatherstonhaugh and Mudge at no more than 388 feet, and that of the\r\nlake at no more than 363. In this estimate they reject the indications\r\nof their own barometers, because the results of them would have\r\ncontradicted the previous impressions which seem to have governed all\r\ntheir operations, viz, that the point claimed by the United States as\r\nthe northwest angle of Nova Scotia is not in an elevated region of\r\ncountry.[34]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: A continuous line of leveling was carried by one of the\r\nparties of Major Graham's division, by means of two spirit levels\r\nchecking one another, from tide water at Calais, in Maine, to the\r\nmonument at the source of the St. Croix, and thence along the true\r\nmeridian line to its intersection with the river St. John. The surface\r\nof the St. John at this point of intersection was thus found to be\r\n419-1/2 feet above the level of mean tide at Calais. The basin of the\r\nriver immediately above the Grand Falls may be stated as of the same\r\nelevation in round numbers, as there is very little current in the river\r\nbetween those two points.]\r\n\r\nOn the third part of the British line from the sources of the Aroostook\r\nto the Grand Falls of the St. John no height is reported as measured by\r\nthe British commissioners which exceeds 1,050 feet, while the greatest\r\nheight on their profile is 1,150 feet. The minimum height on their\r\nprofile, excluding the Aroostook at its mouth and its intersection with\r\nthe meridian line, is 243 feet, and the mean of the numbers entered by\r\nthem both on their map and profile is 665 feet.\r\n\r\nIt will therefore appear that if the profile of Messrs. Featherstonhaugh\r\nand Mudge be correct the lowest gap on the third part of the American\r\nline is about as high as the mean elevation of the part of the British\r\nline with which it is compared.\r\n\r\nThe line claimed by the United States therefore possesses throughout in\r\na pre-eminent degree the highland character according to the sense at\r\none time contended for in the argument of Great Britain, and is, to use\r\nthe term of the British commissioners, \"the axis of maximum elevation,\"\r\nthe mean of all the heights measured upon it being 1,459 feet, while\r\nthat of those measured on the line of Messrs. Featherstonhaugh and Mudge\r\nis no more than 1,085 feet.\r\n\r\nIt is regretted that the computations of the barometric and other\r\nobservations for the determination of the heights of that portion of\r\nthe country between the valley of the St. John and the sources of the\r\nAroostook, explored by the division of Major Graham, could not be\r\ncompleted in time to be made use of for this report in the description\r\nof that portion of the line claimed for Great Britain by Messrs.\r\nFeatherstonhaugh and Mudge. This delay has been solely caused by\r\na want of reasonable time to complete this portion of the work, the\r\ncommissioner having direction of the division charged with it having\r\nonly returned from the field in the month of January.\r\n\r\nSufficient information is known, however, to have been derived from\r\nthose surveys to justify the assertion that, instead of the strongly\r\nmarked range of highlands represented by the British commissioners as\r\nconstituting a part of their \"axis of maximum elevation,\" the country in\r\nthe vicinity of the Aroostook lying between its sources and the valley\r\nof the St. John is devoid of the character they have attributed to it.\r\nWhen properly represented upon a map it will appear as an extended\r\nundulating surface of moderate elevation above the level of the\r\nAroostook River, sparsely interspersed with occasional detached\r\nelevations rising to heights of 600 to 900 and 1,400 feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea, but forming no continuous or connected chain whatever\r\nin the direction represented by the British commissioners, or that could\r\nbe construed into the character of highlands such as are described in\r\nthe treaty of 1783.[35]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: Since the above was written Major Graham's map and the\r\ncomputations of the barometric heights above alluded to have been\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nThis map exhibits in their proper positions the numerous altitudes which\r\nwere determined throughout the country watered by the Aroostook and its\r\nprincipal tributaries, extending laterally to the heights which bound\r\nthe basin of that river on either side; along the due west line traced\r\nin the year 1835 by Captain Yule, of the royal engineers, between Mars\r\nHill and a point near the forks of the Great Machias River; along and in\r\nthe vicinity of the road recently opened by the State of Maine from\r\nLewis's (a point in latitude 46° 12' 20\", between the head branches of\r\nthe Meduxnikeag and the Masardis or St. Croix of the Aroostook) to the\r\nmouth of Fish River, in latitude 47° 15' 13\", being a distance, actually\r\nmeasured, of 79 miles; and along the new military road, embracing 40-1/2\r\nmiles of the distance from Fort Fairfield to Houlton and including the\r\nadjacent heights on either side.\r\n\r\nThe number of elevations within the territory watered by the Aroostook\r\nand claimed by Great Britain that have thus been carefully measured\r\namounts to upward of 200.\r\n\r\nThis survey shows that although the prominent eminences which occur\r\nalong that portion of the \"axis of maximum elevation\" of Messrs. Mudge\r\nand Featherstonhaugh which lies between the mouth and the source of\r\nthe Aroostook correspond very nearly in height and position by our\r\nmeasurements with those reported by themselves, yet these eminences are\r\nseparated one from another by spaces of comparatively low and very often\r\nswampy country, so extended as to preclude the idea of a continuous\r\nrange of highlands in the direction represented upon the map of those\r\ncommissioners.\r\n\r\nIf a range or chain of highlands is to be made to appear by drawing\r\na strongly marked line over widely extended valleys or districts of\r\ncomparatively low country so as to reach and connect the most prominent\r\neminences which may fall within the assumed direction, then such a range\r\nor chain of highlands may here be made as plausibly in any other\r\ndirection as in that chosen by Messrs. Mudge and Featherstonhaugh, for\r\nthe detached elevated peaks are so distributed as under such a principle\r\nto favor any one direction as much as another, and might thus be made to\r\nsubserve in an equal degree whatever conflicting theories the object in\r\nview might cause to be originated.\r\n\r\nWe may also refer, in further illustration of the character of the\r\ncountry through which a portion of this pretended \"axis of maximum\r\nelevation\" is made to pass, to a panorama view taken in October, 1841,\r\nby one of Major Graham's assistants from the summit of Blue Hill, where\r\ncrossed by the true meridian of the monument, at the source of the St.\r\nCroix. This position is 1,100 feet above the level of the sea and 47-1/2\r\nmiles north of the monument. It commands a most satisfactory view of the\r\nwhole country embraced within a radius of 40 to 60 miles, including, as\r\nthe landscape shows, Parks Hill to the south; Katahdin, the Traveller,\r\nand Mars Hill to the southwest; Quaquajo, the Horseback, the Haystack,\r\nand one or two peaks beyond the Aroostook to the west; the heights upon\r\nthe Fish River and the southern margin of the Eagle Lakes to the\r\nnorthwest, and those south of the St. John (except a small angle\r\nobstructed by the Aroostook Hill) to the north.\r\n\r\nThe character of the great basin of the Aroostook, dotted with the\r\ndetached peaks which rise abruptly from it at intervals of many miles\r\napart, is here exhibited through at least two-thirds of its extent in so\r\nsatisfactory a manner as in itself to preclude the idea of an \"axis of\r\nmaximum elevation\" composed of anything like a connected or continuous\r\nchain in this region of country.\r\n\r\nMAY 1 1842.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the surveys upon the boundary line claimed by the United\r\nStates, an exploring line was run under the direction of Professor\r\nRenwick, as is more particularly described in Appendix No. 1. This line\r\nextended to an eminence on the eastern side of Lake Matapediac, elevated\r\n1,743 feet above the level of the sea. The views obtained from this\r\neminence established the fact that a chain of highlands extended thence\r\nto the north shore of the Bay des Chaleurs. They are believed to\r\nterminate in an eminence, which from its imposing appearance has been\r\ncalled by the Scotch settlers at its foot Ben Lomond. This was measured\r\nduring the operations of the summer of 1840, and found to rise from\r\nthe tide of the bay to the height of 1,024 feet. This exploring line,\r\ncoupled with the more accurate surveys, appears to establish the fact of\r\nthe existence of a continuous chain of eminences entitled to the epithet\r\nof highlands from the north shore of the Bay des Chaleurs at its western\r\nextremity to the sources of the Connecticut River. Returning from the\r\nlatter point, they exhibit the aspect of well-marked ranges of mountains\r\nas far as the sources of the Metjarmette. Thence to the sources of the\r\nEtchemin extends an undulating country whose mean height is 1,300 or\r\n1,500 feet above the level of the sea. The boundary line is thence\r\nprolonged to the Temiscouata portage over well-defined ridges to the\r\neastern side of Lake Temiscouata. At the sources of two of the streams\r\nwhich run into this lake the minimum heights of 651 feet and 676 feet\r\nhave been observed.\r\n\r\nWith these exceptions, the sources of the streams which rise to the\r\nnorth of the Temiscouata portage and between the lake of that name and\r\nLake Matapediac average more than 900 feet above the level of the sea.\r\nFor the purpose of describing this portion of the line claimed by the\r\nUnited States, we may take this height of 900 feet as the elevation of\r\na horizontal plane or base. On this are raised knolls, eminences, and\r\nshort ridges whose heights above this assumed base vary from 300 to\r\n1,300 feet. The more elevated of these are universally designated by the\r\nhunters who occasionally visit the country and the lumberers who search\r\nit for timber as mountains clothed to the summit with wood, which, in\r\nconsequence of the rigor of the climate, attains but a feeble growth.\r\nThey have an aspect of much greater altitude than they in reality\r\npossess, but their character as highlands is indisputable. This term,\r\nwhich the first English visitors ascribed without hesitation to the\r\nhills of New Jersey,[36] whose altitude is about 300 feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea, is much better merited by a group of eminences rising\r\nfrom 300 to 1,300 feet above a base itself 900 feet in height, and which\r\nexceed in elevation the well-known highlands of the Hudson River.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: The highlands of Neversink.]\r\n\r\nNot to rest merely on instances drawn from the language of those of\r\nEnglish birth who first settled or traded on the coast of the present\r\nUnited States, there are in the immediate vicinity of the region in\r\nquestion a range of eminences the highest of which is no more than\r\n1,206 feet above the level of the sea. These, on the authority of a\r\ndistinguished officer of Her Britannic Majesty's navy,[37] are named\r\nthe \"highlands of Bic,\" and have long been thus known by all the\r\nnavigators of the St. Lawrence who use the English tongue.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: Captain Byfield.]\r\n\r\nTo sum up the results of the field operations of the commissioners:\r\n\r\n(1) The meridian has been traced by astronomic observations from the\r\nmonument, established by the consent of both nations in 1798, at the\r\nsource of the St. Croix to a point 4 miles beyond the left bank of the\r\nSt. John in the neighborhood of the Grand Falls. In the course of this\r\nnot only has no highland dividing waters which run into the St. Lawrence\r\nfrom those which run into the Atlantic been reached, but no common\r\nsource or reservoir of two streams running in opposite directions.[38]\r\nNo place has, therefore, been found which by any construction proposed\r\nor attempted to be put on the words of the treaty of 1783 can be\r\nconsidered as the northwest angle of Nova Scotia. This point must, in\r\nconsequence, lie in the further prolongation of the meridian line to\r\nthe north.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: The levelings carried along this meridian line by means of\r\nspirit levels, alluded to in the note at bottom of page 121, passed Mars\r\nHill at a depression of 12 feet _below_ the level of the base of the\r\nmonument which stands (except at seasons of extreme drought) in the\r\nwater at the source of the St. Croix.]\r\n\r\n(2) The streams whose title to the name of the northwesternmost head of\r\nthe Connecticut River is in dispute have been explored, and the line of\r\nthe highlands has been traced from their sources to the point at which\r\nthe lines respectively claimed by the two nations diverge from each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n(3) The line claimed by Messrs. Featherstonhaugh and Mudge, on the part\r\nof Great Britain, has been in a great measure explored.\r\n\r\n(4) The line of highlands claimed by the United States has, with some\r\nsmall exceptions, been thoroughly examined, and its prolongation as far\r\nas the north shore of the Bay of Chaleurs reconnoitered. The parts of\r\nthe line which have not been actually reached have been seen from a\r\ndistance, and streams flowing from them crossed and leveled. From the\r\nformer indication it is probable that the average height of those parts\r\nexceeds that of the neighboring parts of the line. From the heights of\r\nthe streams it is certain that the lowest gaps in the unexplored portion\r\nof the line can not be less elevated than 1,000 feet above the level of\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nThat part of this line of highlands which lies east of the sources of\r\nthe Rimouski fulfills to the letter the words of the royal proclamation\r\nof 1763 and the contemporaneous commission of Governor Wilmot. The first\r\nof those instruments defines the mouth of the river St. Lawrence by a\r\nline drawn from Cape Rozier to the St. John River (on the Labrador\r\ncoast), and therefore all to the eastward of that line is \"the sea.\" The\r\nheight of land thus traced by the commission, rising from the north\r\nshore of the Bay des Chaleurs at its western extremity, divides waters\r\nwhich fall into the river St. Lawrence from those which fall into the\r\nsea, and is the southern boundary of the Province established by the\r\nproclamation of 1763 under the name of Quebec. The identity of the line\r\ndefined in the proclamation of 1763 and the boundary of the United\r\nStates in the treaty of 1783 has been uniformly maintained on the part\r\nof the United States, and is not merely admitted but strenuously argued\r\nfor in the report of Messrs. Featherstonhaugh and Mudge.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned therefore report that they have explored and in a great\r\nmeasure surveyed and leveled a line of highlands in which the northwest\r\nangle of Nova Scotia lies, and which in their opinion is the true\r\nboundary between the States of Maine and New Hampshire and the British\r\nProvinces.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--EXAMINATION OF THE ARGUMENT CONTAINED IN THE REPORT OF MESSRS.\r\nMUDGE AND FEATHERSTONHAUGH.\r\n\r\nThe progress which has been made in the first portion of the duties\r\nof the commissioners has been set forth in the preceding part of this\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as will be there seen, the task of running the meridian line\r\nof the monument marking the source of the St. Croix and of exploring and\r\nsurveying the lines of highlands respectively claimed by the Governments\r\nof the United States and Great Britain has not been completed, yet\r\nenough has been done to furnish materials for an examination of the\r\nargument preferred by Messrs. Mudge and Featherstonhaugh in support of\r\nthe novel form in which the claim of Great Britain has been presented\r\nby them.\r\n\r\nIn the surveys made by direction of the commissioners under the fifth\r\narticle of the treaty of Ghent the difficult character of the country\r\nhad prevented any other method of exploration than that of ascending\r\nrivers to their sources. It was believed on the part of the United\r\nStates that the determination of the position of these sources was\r\nsufficient for the demarcation of the line of highlands in relation to\r\nwhich the controversy exists, and no attempt was made to meet the\r\nBritish argument by the exhibition of the fact that the lines joining\r\nthese sources run in some cases along ridges and in other cases pass\r\nover elevations to which in any sense of the term the epithet of\r\n\"highlands\" may be justly applied. The denial of this mode of\r\ndetermining the line of highlands by Great Britain has made it important\r\nthat both the lines claimed by Great Britain and by the United States\r\nshould be explored and leveled--a task which until recently had not been\r\nattempted on either part. The examination of the lines claimed by the\r\ntwo nations, respectively, has been in a great measure accomplished, as\r\nwill be seen from the reports of the field operations of the commission,\r\nwhile such of these determinations as have a direct bearing on the\r\nargument will be cited in their proper place in this report.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the document now under consideration exhibits\r\nmany instances of an unfriendly spirit. Charges of direct and implied\r\nfraud are made, and language is used throughout that is irritating and\r\ninsulting. It is fondly hoped that these passages do not express the\r\nsentiments of the British nation, as in a state of feeling such as\r\nthis report indicates little hope could be entertained of an amicable\r\nadjustment of this question. Any inference to be drawn from the language\r\nof the report under consideration is contradicted by the official\r\ndeclarations of the British Government, and may therefore be considered\r\nas the individual act of the authors, not as the deliberate voice of the\r\nnation by which they were employed.\r\n\r\nIt might have been easy to have retorted similar charges, and thus have\r\nexcited in the Government of Great Britain feelings of irritation\r\nsimilar to those which pervaded the whole population of the United\r\nStates on the reception of that report. While, however, it is due\r\nto the honor of the United States to declare that no desire of undue\r\naggrandizement has been felt, no claim advanced beyond what a strict\r\nconstruction of their rights will warrant, it is trusted that the\r\npretensions of Great Britain, however unfounded in fact or principle,\r\nhave been advanced with a like disregard to mere extension of territory,\r\nand urged with the same good faith which has uniformly characterized the\r\nproceedings of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered that the claims of Great Britain have been\r\nurged with the utmost pertinacity and supported by every possible form\r\nof argument. The territory in question is of great value to her, by\r\ncovering the only mode of communication which can exist for nearly six\r\nmonths in the year, not only between two valuable colonies, but between\r\nthe most important of all her possessions and the mother country. The\r\ntime is not long past when the use of this very communication was not an\r\nunimportant part of the means by which that colony was restrained from\r\nan attempt to assert its independence. It is not, therefore, surprising\r\nthat the feelings of British statesmen and of those who desired to win\r\ntheir favor have been more obvious in the several arguments which have\r\nappeared on that side of the question than a sober view of the true\r\nprinciples, on which alone a correct opinion of the case can be founded.\r\n\r\nTo the United States in their collective capacity the territory in\r\ndispute is, on the other hand, of comparatively little moment. No other\r\ndesire is felt throughout the greater part of the Union than that the\r\nquestion should be settled upon just principles. No regret could,\r\ntherefore, be widely felt if it should be satisfactorily shown that the\r\ntitle of Great Britain to this region is indisputable. But should it be\r\nshown, as is beyond all question the fact, that the title is in truth in\r\nthe United States, national honor forbids that this title should be\r\nabandoned. To the States of Maine and Massachusetts, who are the joint\r\nproprietors of the unseated lands, the territory is of a certain\r\nimportance from the value of the land and timber, and to the latter,\r\nwithin whose jurisdiction it falls, as a future means of increasing her\r\nrelative importance in the Union, and a just and proper feeling on the\r\npart of their sister States must prevent their yielding to any unfounded\r\nclaim or the surrender of any territory to which a title can be\r\nestablished without an equivalent satisfactory to those States.\r\n\r\nTo show the basis on which the title rests--\r\n\r\nIt is maintained on the part of the United States that the territory\r\nthey held on the continent of North America prior to the purchase of\r\nLouisiana and the Floridas was possessed by a title derived from their\r\nown Declaration of Independence on the 4th of July, 1776, the assertion\r\nof that independence in a successful war, and its acknowledgment by\r\nGreat Britain as a preliminary to any negotiation for a treaty of peace.\r\nIt is admitted on the part of Great Britain that a territory designated\r\nby certain limits was _granted_ to the United States in the treaty of\r\n1783. As a matter of national pride, the question whether the territory\r\nof the original United States was held by the right of war or by virtue\r\nof a grant from the British Crown is not unimportant; as a basis of\r\ntitle it has not the least bearing on the subject. From the date of the\r\ntreaty of 1783 all pretensions of the British Crown to jurisdiction or\r\nproperty within the limits prescribed by the provisions of that\r\ninstrument ceased, and when a war arose in 1812 between the two nations\r\nit was terminated by the treaty of Ghent, in which the original\r\nboundaries were confirmed and acknowledged on both sides.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of 1783, therefore, is, in reference to this territory, the\r\nonly instrument of binding force upon the two parties; nor can any other\r\ndocument be with propriety brought forward in the discussion except for\r\nthe purpose of explaining and rendering definite such of the provisions\r\nof that treaty as are obscure or apparently uncertain.\r\n\r\nThe desire of full and ample illustration, which has actuated both\r\nparties, has led to the search among neglected archives for documents\r\nalmost innumerable, and their force and bearing upon the question have\r\nbeen exhibited in arguments of great ability. Such has been the talent\r\nshown in this task of illustration and so copious have been the\r\nmaterials employed for the purpose that the great and only important\r\nquestion, although never lost sight of by the writers themselves, has\r\nto the eye of the casual observer been completely hidden. In the report\r\nunder consideration this distinction between treaties of binding force\r\nand documents intended for mere illustration has not been regarded, and\r\nthe vague as well as obviously inaccurate delineations of a French or a\r\nVenetian map maker are gravely held forth as of equal value for a basis\r\nof argument as the solemn and ratified acts of the two nations.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this desire of illustration, every known document which\r\ncould in any form support either claim has been advanced and set forth\r\nin the statements laid before His Majesty the King of the Netherlands\r\nwhen acting as umpire under the fifth article of the treaty of Ghent. If\r\nnot yet given entire to the public,[39] they are in the possession of\r\nboth Governments in a printed form, together with the opinion of the\r\narbiter in respect to them; and although it is necessary that the\r\narguments then adduced in favor of the American claim should be in part\r\nrepeated, and although new illustrations of the correctness of that\r\nargument have since been brought to light, the present document will be\r\nconfined as closely as possible to the provisions of the treaty itself,\r\nand will adduce no more of illustration than is barely sufficient to\r\nrender the terms of that treaty certain and definite.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: A considerable part of the papers, together with the\r\nargument, has been published by Mr. Gallatin in his Right of the United\r\nStates to the Northeastern Boundary. New York, 1840. 8 vo. pp. 180.]\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of the United States are described in the treaty of 1783\r\nin the following words:[40]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: The words here appearing in italics are not italicized in\r\nthe original treaty.]\r\n\r\n\"And that _all disputes which might arise in future on the subject\r\nof the boundaries of the said United States may be prevented_ it is\r\nhereby agreed and declared that the following are and shall be their\r\nboundaries, viz: _From the northwest angle of Nova Scotia_, viz, _that\r\nangle which is formed by a line drawn due north from the source of\r\nSt. Croix River to the highlands; along the said highlands which divide\r\nthose rivers that empty themselves into the river St. Lawrence from\r\nthose which fall into the Atlantic Ocean_ to the _northwesternmost_ head\r\nof Connecticut River; _thence_ down along the middle of that river to\r\nthe forty-fifth degree of north latitude; from thence by a line due west\r\non said latitude until it strikes the river Iroquois, or Cataraquy;\r\nthence along the middle of said river into Lake Ontario; through the\r\nmiddle of said lake until it strikes the communication by water between\r\nthat lake and Lake Brie; thence along the middle of said communication\r\ninto Lake Erie through the middle of said lake until it arrives at the\r\nwater communication between that lake and Lake Huron; thence along the\r\nmiddle of said water communication into the Lake Huron; thence through\r\nthe middle of said lake to the water communication between that lake and\r\nLake Superior; thence through Lake Superior northward of the Isles Royal\r\nand Phelipeaux to the Long Lake; thence through the middle of said Long\r\nLake and the water communication between it and the Lake of the Woods to\r\nthe said Lake of the Woods; thence through the said lake to the most\r\nnorthwestern point thereof, and from thence on a due west course to the\r\nriver Mississippi; thence by a line to be drawn along the middle of the\r\nsaid river Mississippi until it shall intersect the northernmost part of\r\nthe thirty-first degree of north latitude; south by a line to be drawn\r\ndue east from the determination of the line last mentioned in the\r\nlatitude of 31° north of the equator to the middle of the river\r\nApalachicola, or Catahouche; thence along the middle thereof to its\r\njunction with the Flint River; thence straight to the head of St. Marys\r\nRiver, and thence down along the middle of St. Marys River to the\r\nAtlantic Ocean; east _by a line to be drawn along the middle of the\r\nriver St. Croix from its mouth in the Bay of Fundy to its source_ and\r\nfrom its source _directly north_ to the aforesaid highlands which divide\r\nthe rivers that fall into the Atlantic Ocean from those which fall into\r\nthe river St. Lawrence; comprehending all islands within 20 leagues of\r\nany part of the shores of the United States and lying between lines to\r\nbe drawn due east from the points where the aforesaid boundaries between\r\nNova Scotia on the one part and East Florida on the other shall\r\nrespectively touch the Bay of Fundy and the Atlantic Ocean, excepting\r\nsuch islands as now are or heretofore have been within the limits of\r\nthe said Province of Nova Scotia.\"\r\n\r\nSo far as the present question is concerned, five points of discussion\r\nare presented by this article of the treaty of 1783:\r\n\r\nI. What stream is to be understood by the name of the river St. Croix?\r\n\r\nII. The determination of the line due north from the source of that\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nIII. What is the position of the northwest angle of Nova Scotia?\r\n\r\nIV. The delineation of the line passing through the highlands from that\r\nangle to the northwest head of Connecticut River.\r\n\r\nV. What is to be considered as the northwestern head of Connecticut\r\nRiver?\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--RIVER ST. CROIX.\r\n\r\nDoubts in respect to the particular river intended to be understood by\r\nthe name of the St. Croix having arisen, an article was inserted in the\r\ntreaty of commerce signed in London in November, 1794, by Lord Grenville\r\non the part of Great Britain and by John Jay on the part of the United\r\nStates.[41] This article, the fifth of that treaty, provided for the\r\nappointment of a joint commission with full powers to decide that\r\nquestion. This commission was constituted in conformity, and the award\r\nwas accepted by both Governments.[42] The river designated in this award\r\nbecame thenceforth the true St. Croix, however erroneous may have been\r\nthe grounds on which it was decided so to be. When, therefore, in the\r\nfourth article of the treaty of Ghent it is declared that the due north\r\nline from the source of the St. Croix has not been surveyed, and when in\r\nthis and the other articles of the same treaty all other uncertain parts\r\nof the boundary are recited, the validity of the decision of the\r\ncommissioners under the fifth article of Jay's treaty is virtually\r\nacknowledged. Nay, more; the acknowledgment is completed by the\r\nstipulation in the second article of the treaty of Ghent that \"all\r\nterritory, places, and possessions taken by either party during the\r\nwar,\" with certain exceptions, shall be forthwith restored to their\r\nprevious possessors.[43] The only exceptions are the islands in\r\nPassamaquoddy Bay; and had it been believed that any uncertainty in\r\nrespect to the adjacent territory existed it would not have been\r\nneglected. Nay, more; all the settlements lying within the line claimed\r\nby Great Britain before the commission created by the treaty of 1794 had\r\nbeen taken, and were in her actual possession at the time the treaty of\r\nGhent took effect, and were forthwith restored to the jurisdiction of\r\nthe United States. When, also, it became necessary to proceed to the\r\ninvestigation of the second point of the discussion, the agents and\r\nsurveyors of both parties proceeded as a matter of course to the point\r\nmarked in 1798 as the source of the St. Croix.[44] This point is\r\ntherefore fixed and established beyond the possibility of cavil, and the\r\nfaith of both Governments is pledged that it shall not be disturbed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: See Note I, pp. 141,142.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: See Note II, p. 142.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: See Note III, pp. 142,143.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: See Note IV, p. 143.]\r\n\r\nII.--DUE NORTH LINE FROM THE SOURCE OF THE ST. CROIX.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of 1783 provides that the boundary from the source of the\r\nSt. Croix shall be drawn \"directly north.\" In relation to this expression\r\nno possible doubt can arise. It is neither susceptible of more than a\r\nsingle meaning nor does it require illustration from any extrinsic\r\nsource. The undersigned, therefore, do not consider that so much of the\r\nargument of Messrs. Mudge and Featherstonhaugh as attempts to show that\r\nthis line ought to be drawn in any other direction than due north\r\nrequires any reply on the part of the United States. Admitting that the\r\nwords had been originally used as a mistranslation of terms in the Latin\r\ngrant of James I to Sir William Alexander, the misconception was equally\r\nshared by both parties to the treaty of 1783; and it will be shown\r\nhereafter that this misconception, if any, had its origin in British\r\nofficial papers. Were it capable of proof beyond all possibility of\r\ndenial that the limit of the grant to Sir William Alexander was intended\r\nto be a line drawn toward the northwest instead of the north it would\r\nnot affect the question. So far as that grant was used by American\r\nnegotiators to illustrate the position of the northwest angle of Nova\r\nScotia it would have failed to fulfill the object, but such failure in\r\nillustration does not involve the nullity of the treaty itself.\r\n\r\nThat the translation which has hitherto been universally received as\r\ncorrect of the terms in the grant to Sir William Alexander is the true\r\none, and that the new construction which is now attempted to be put upon\r\nit is inaccurate, will be shown in another place,[45] where will also be\r\nexhibited an error committed in rendering the sense of another part of\r\nthat instrument. The consideration of the correctness or incorrectness\r\nof the several translations can form no part of the present argument.\r\nWhile, therefore, it is denied that Messrs. Mudge and Featherstonhaugh\r\nhave succeeded in showing that the grant to Sir William Alexander has\r\nbeen mistranslated, it is maintained that an error in the translation of\r\nthis document can have no effect in setting aside the simple and\r\npositive terms of the treaty of 1783. That treaty and its confirmation\r\nin the treaty of Ghent must be admitted to be null and void before that\r\nline can be drawn in any other direction than \"due north.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: See Note V, pp. 143-147.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--NORTH WEST ANGLE OF NOVA SCOTIA.\r\n\r\nThe term northwest angle of Nova Scotia was used in the secret\r\ninstructions of Congress and is adopted in the treaty of 1783. In the\r\ninstructions it is named without any explanation, as if it were a point\r\nperfectly well known. In one sense it was so, for although it never had\r\nbeen marked by a monument, nor perhaps visited by the foot of man, its\r\nposition could be laid down upon a map; nay, was so on many existing\r\nmaps, and the directions for finding it on the ground were clear and\r\nexplicit. These directions are to be found in the royal proclamation of\r\nOctober, 1763, and in the commission to Montague Wilmot, governor of\r\nNova Scotia, of cotemporaneous date. Any uncertainty in regard to the\r\nposition of this angle which may have existed in relation to the meaning\r\nof the first of these instruments is removed by the act of Parliament of\r\n1774, commonly called the Quebec act.\r\n\r\nBefore citing these instruments it will be proper to refer to the\r\ncircumstances under which the two first were issued.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain, after a successful war, found herself in possession of\r\nthe whole eastern side of the continent of North America. So much of\r\nthis as lay to the south of the St. Lawrence and the forty-fifth\r\nparallel of north latitude had been previously made the subject of\r\ncharters from the British Crown under a claim of right from priority of\r\ndiscovery.[46] The possession of this wide tract was not uncontested,\r\nand various other European nations had attempted to found settlements\r\nwithin the limits of the British charters. In such cases it was held as\r\na matter of law that where the occupation or defense of the territory\r\ngranted had been neglected the right had ceased, and the country, when\r\nrecovered by conquest or restored by treaty, was again vested in the\r\nCrown, to be made the subject of new grants or governed as a royal\r\ncolony. Thus, when the settlements made by the Dutch and Swedes, which\r\nby the fortune of war had become wholly vested in Holland, were reduced,\r\nthe Crown exercised its rights by conveying them to the Duke of York,\r\nalthough covered in a great part, if not wholly, by previous charters;\r\nand when these countries were again occupied by the Dutch and restored\r\nby the treaty of Breda it was thought necessary that the title of the\r\nDuke of York should be restored by a fresh grant. In both of these\r\ncharters to that prince was included the Province of Sagadahock, within\r\nwhose chartered limits was comprised the territory at present in\r\ndispute. This Province, confined on the sea between the rivers St. Croix\r\nand Kennebec, had for its opposite limits the St. Lawrence, or, as the\r\ngrant expresses it, \"extending from the river of Kenebeque and so upward\r\nby the shortest course to the river Canada northward.\" The shortest\r\ncourse from the source of the Kennebec to the St. Lawrence is by the\r\npresent Kennebec road. This grant therefore covered the whole space\r\nalong the St. Lawrence from about the mouth of the Chaudiere River[47]\r\nto the eastern limit of the grant to Sir William Alexander. By the\r\naccession of James II, or, as some maintain, by the act of attainder, it\r\nmatters not which, this Province reverted to the Crown, and was by it\r\ngranted, in 1691, to the colony of Massachusetts. In the same charter\r\nNova Scotia also was included. This has been called a war grant, as in\r\nfact it was, and the colony of Massachusetts speedily availed themselves\r\nof it by conquering the whole of the territory conveyed except the\r\nisland of Cape Breton. The latter, too, fell before the unassisted arms\r\nof the New England Provinces in 1745, at a time when Great Britain was\r\ntoo deeply engaged in the contest of a civil war to give aid either in\r\nmoney or in men to her transatlantic possessions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: Sebastian Cabot, in the employ of Henry VII, discovered\r\nthe continent of North America 24th June, 1497, and explored it from\r\nHudsons Bay to Florida in 1498. Columbus discovered South America 1st\r\nAugust, 1498, while the voyage of Vespucci, whose name has been given to\r\nthe continent, was not performed until 1499.--HUMBOLDT.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: See Note VI, p. 147.]\r\n\r\nThe colony of Massachusetts, therefore, could not be charged with any\r\nwant of energy in asserting her chartered rights to the territory in\r\nquestion. It is, in fact, due to her exertions that both Nova Scotia\r\nand New Brunswick came at so early a period into the possession of the\r\nBritish Crown. In 1654 the French settlements as far as Port Royal, at\r\nthe head of the Bay of Fundy, were reduced by Major Sedgwick, but by the\r\ntreaty of Breda they were restored to France.\r\n\r\nIn 1690 Sir William Phips, governor of Massachusetts, with a force\r\nof 700 men, raised in that colony, again conquered the country, and\r\nalthough on his return the French dislodged the garrison possession\r\nwas forthwith resumed by an expedition under Colonel Church. Acadie,\r\nhowever, or Nova Scotia, was ceded again to France by the treaty of\r\nRyswick. After several spirited but unsuccessful attempts during the War\r\nof the Succession, General Nicholson, with a force of five regiments,\r\nfour of which were levied in Massachusetts, reduced Port Royal, and by\r\nits capitulation the present Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick\r\nwere permanently annexed to the British Crown.[48] Finally the militia\r\nof Massachusetts, during the War of 1776, took possession of the\r\nterritory, and occupied it until the date of the treaty of 1783. This\r\noccupation was not limited by the St. Croix, or even by the St. John,\r\nbut included the whole of the southern part of New Brunswick, while the\r\npeninsula of Nova Scotia was only preserved to Great Britain by the\r\nfortification of the isthmus which unites it to the mainland.[49]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: Haliburton's History, Vol. I, pp. 83-87.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: Haliburton's History, Vol. I, pp. 244-289.]\r\n\r\nThe recession of Acadie, or Nova Scotia, to France by the treaty of\r\nRyswick divested Massachusetts only of the territory granted her in the\r\ncharter of 1691 under the latter name. Her war title to Sagadahock was\r\nconfirmed by a conquest with her own unaided arms; and even the cession\r\nof Nova Scotia was a manifest injustice to her, as she was at the moment\r\nin full possession of it. It, however, suited the purpose of Great\r\nBritain to barter this part of the conquest of that colony for objects\r\nof more immediate interest.\r\n\r\nAdmitting that England did convey a part or the whole of Sagadahock to\r\nFrance under the vague name of Acadie or Nova Scotia,[50] the conquest\r\nby Massachusetts in 1710 renewed her rights to this much at least, and\r\nalthough the Crown appropriated to itself the lion's share of the spoils\r\nby making Nova Scotia a royal province, it did not attempt to disturb\r\nher possession of Sagadahock. So far from so doing, the commission of\r\nthe royal governors was limited to the west by the St. Croix, although\r\nit was stated in a saving clause that the Province of Nova Scotia\r\nextended of right to the Penobscot. From that time until the breaking\r\nout of the Revolutionary War, a space of more than sixty years, the\r\nProvince of Sagadahock was left in the undisturbed possession of\r\nMassachusetts under the charter of 1691.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: See Note VII, pp. 147, 148.]\r\n\r\nIn defiance of this charter the French proceeded to occupy the right\r\nbank of the St. Lawrence, which at the time of the capture of Quebec and\r\nthe cession in the treaty of 1763 was partially held by settlements of\r\nCanadians. The Crown therefore acted upon the principle that the right\r\nof Massachusetts to the right bank of the St. Lawrence had thus become\r\nvoid, and proceeded by proclamation to form the possessions of France on\r\nboth banks of the St. Lawrence into a royal colony under the name of the\r\nProvince of Quebec.\r\n\r\nThis was not done without a decided opposition on the part of\r\nMassachusetts, but any decision in respect to her claims was rendered\r\nneedless by the breaking out of the War of Independence. It is only\r\nproper to remark that this opposition was in fact made and that her\r\nclaim to the right bank of the St. Lawrence was only abandoned by the\r\ntreaty of 1783. The country of which it was intended to divest her by\r\nthe proclamation of 1763 is described in a letter of her agent, Mr.\r\nMauduit, to the general court of that colony as \"the narrow tract of\r\nland which lies beyond the sources of all your rivers and is watered\r\nby those which run into the St. Lawrence.\"\r\n\r\nIt is assigned by him as a reason why the Province of Massachusetts\r\nshould assent to the boundary assigned to the Province of Quebec by the\r\nproclamation that \"it would not be of any great consequence to you\"\r\n(Massachusetts), \"but is absolutely necessary to the Crown to preserve\r\nthe continuity of the Province of Quebec.\" The part of the Province of\r\nQuebec whose continuity with the rest of that colony was to be preserved\r\nis evidently the district of Gaspe, of which Nova Scotia, a royal\r\ncolony, was divested by the same proclamation. For this continuity no\r\nmore was necessary than a road along the St. Lawrence itself, and the\r\nreason would have been absurd if applied to any country lying beyond\r\nthe streams which fall into that river, for up to the present day no\r\ncommunication between parts of Canada exists through any part of the\r\ndisputed territory. The narrow territory thus advised to be relinquished\r\nextends, according to the views of Messrs. Mudge and Featherstonhaugh,\r\nfrom the Great Falls of the St. John to Quebec, a distance in a straight\r\nline of 160 miles. It has a figure not far from triangular, of which\r\nthis line is the perpendicular and the shore of the St. Lawrence from\r\nthe Chaudiere to the Metis the base. It contains about 16,000 square\r\nmiles. It would have been a perversion of language in Mr. Mauduit to\r\ndescribe this to his employers as a narrow tract. But the space whose\r\ncession he really intended to advise is in every sense a narrow tract,\r\nfor its length along the St. Lawrence is about 200 miles, and its\r\naverage breadth to the sources of the streams 30. It contains 6,000\r\nsquare miles, and is described by him in a manner that leaves no\r\nquestion as to its extent being \"watered by streams\" which \"run into the\r\nSt. Lawrence.\" It therefore did not include any country watered by\r\nstreams which run into the St. John.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that this is the first instance in which the term\r\n_narrow_ has ever been applied to a triangle almost right angled and\r\nnearly isosceles, and it is not a little remarkable that this very\r\nexpression was relied upon in the statement to the King of the\r\nNetherlands as one of the strongest proofs of the justice of the\r\nAmerican claim.\r\n\r\nAdmitting, however, for the sake of argument, that the Crown did demand\r\nthis territory, and that the mere advice of an agent without powers was\r\nbinding on Massachusetts, the fact would have no direct bearing upon the\r\npoint under consideration. The relinquishment by Massachusetts of the\r\nwhole of the territory west of the meridian of the St. Croix would not\r\nhave changed the position of the northwest angle of Nova Scotia, nor the\r\ntitle of the United States collectively under the treaty of 1783 to a\r\nboundary to be drawn from that angle, however it might have affected the\r\nright of property of that State to the lands within it.\r\n\r\nAnd here it is to be remarked that the Government of the United States\r\nis two-fold--that of the individual States and that of the Federal\r\nUnion. It would be possible, therefore, that all right of property in\r\nunseated lands within a State's jurisdiction might be in the General\r\nGovernment, and this is in fact the case in all the new States. Even had\r\nMassachusetts divested herself of the title (which she has not) the\r\ntreaty of 1783 would have vested it in the Confederation. She had at\r\nleast a color of title, under which the Confederation claimed to the\r\nboundaries of Nova Scotia on the east and to the southern limits of the\r\nProvince of Quebec on the north, and this claim was allowed by Great\r\nBritain in the treaty of 1783 in terms which are at least admitted to be\r\nidentical in meaning with those of the proclamation creating the latter\r\nProvince.[51]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: Report of Messrs. Featherstonhaugh and Mudge, p. 6.]\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the subject further:\r\n\r\nOf the seventeen British colonies in North America, thirteen succeeded\r\nin asserting their independence; the two Floridas were conquered and\r\nceded to Spain; while of her magnificent American domain only Quebec and\r\nNova Scotia were left to Great Britain. The thirteen colonies, now\r\nindependent States, claimed all that part of the continent to the\r\neastward of the Mississippi and north of the bounds of Florida which was\r\nnot contained within the limits of the last-named colonies, and this\r\nclaim was fully admitted by the boundary agreed to in the treaty of\r\n1783. Within the limits thus assigned it was well known that there were\r\nconflicting claims to parts which had more than once been covered by\r\nroyal charters; it was even possible that there were portions of the\r\nwide territory the right to which was asserted by the United States and\r\nadmitted by Great Britain that had not been covered by any royal grant;\r\nbut the jurisdiction in respect to disputed rights and the title to land\r\nnot conveyed forever ceased to be in the British Crown--first by a\r\nsuccessful assertion of independence in arms, and finally by the\r\npositive terms of a solemn treaty.\r\n\r\nIf it should be admitted, for argument's sake, that the claim of\r\nMassachusetts, as inherited by the State of Maine, to the disputed\r\nterritory is unfounded, it is a circumstance that can not enter into\r\na discussion between Great Britain and the United States of America.\r\nMassachusetts did claim, under at least the color of a title, not merely\r\nto \"the highlands,\" but to the St. Lawrence itself, and the claim was\r\nadmitted as far as the former by the treaty of 1783. If it should\r\nhereafter appear that this claim can not be maintained, the territory\r\nwhich is not covered by her title, if within the boundary of the treaty\r\nof 1783, can not revert to Great Britain, which has ceded its rights to\r\nthe thirteen independent States, but to the latter in their confederate\r\ncapacity, and is thus the property of the whole Union. As well might\r\nGreat Britain set up a claim to the States of Alabama and Mississippi,\r\nwhich, although claimed by the State of Georgia, were found not to be\r\ncovered by its royal charter, as to any part of the territory contained\r\nwithin the line defined by the treaty of 1783, under pretense that the\r\nrights of Massachusetts are not indefeasible.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, it is maintained that whether the title of\r\nMassachusetts be valid or not is immaterial to the present question,\r\nit may be further urged that not even the shadow of a pretense existed\r\nfor divesting her of her rights by the proclamation of 1763, except to\r\nterritory which by neglect she had permitted France to occupy. On this\r\npoint the French are the best authority, for it can not be pretended\r\nthat the Crown of England intended in forming the Province of Quebec\r\nto go beyond the utmost limits of the claim of France to her colony of\r\nCanada. The assertions on the part of France in the argument preceding\r\nthe War of 1756 were:\r\n\r\nFirst. That both banks of the St. Lawrence are included in Canada.\r\n\r\nSecond. That with the exception of Miscou and Cape Breton, her grants\r\nextended 10 leagues from the river.\r\n\r\nThird. That the commissions of the governors of Canada in the most\r\nformal and precise manner extended their jurisdiction to the sources\r\nof the rivers which discharge themselves into the St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\nNow the distance of 10 French leagues and that of the sources of the\r\nrivers, on an average, are nearly identical, and this narrow tract, of\r\nwhich alone the Crown could with any shadow of justice assume the right\r\nof disposing, is that of which Massachusetts was intended to be divested\r\nby the proclamation of 1763.\r\n\r\nIt was because Great Britain held that these claims on the part of\r\nFrance were too extensive that the War of 1756 was waged. In this war at\r\nleast one-half of the force which under Wolfe took Louisburg and reduced\r\nQuebec, and under Amherst forced the French armies in Canada to a\r\ncapitulation, was raised and paid by the colonies. The creation of the\r\nProvince of Quebec, covering a part of their chartered limits, was\r\ntherefore a just subject of complaint.\r\n\r\nThe bounds assigned to the new Province of Quebec to the south by the\r\nproclamation of 7th October, 1763, are as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The line, crossing the river St. Lawrence and the Lake Champlain in 45°\r\nof north latitude, passes along the highlands which divide the rivers\r\nthat empty themselves into the St. Lawrence from those which fall into\r\nthe sea, and also along the north coast of the Bay des Chaleurs and the\r\nGulf of St. Lawrence to Cape Rosieres,\" etc.\r\n\r\nIn the same month of October, 1763, the limits of the royal Province of\r\nNova Scotia are fixed, in the commission to Governor Wilmot, on the west\r\n\"by the said river St. Croix to its source, and by a line drawn due\r\nnorth from thence to the southern boundary of our Province of Quebec; to\r\nthe northward, by the same boundary, as far as the western extremity of\r\nthe Bay des Chaleurs.\"\r\n\r\nHere, then, we find the first mention in an English dress of the line\r\nto be drawn due north from the source of the St. Croix. There is no\r\nevidence that it was a translation of the terms in the grant to Sir\r\nWilliam Alexander, but if it were it was made not by Americans, but by\r\nEnglishmen; and not only made, but set forth under the high authority of\r\nthe royal sign manual and authenticated by the great seal of the United\r\nKingdom of England and Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe due north line from the source of the St. Croix, meeting the south\r\nbounds of the Province of Quebec, forms two angles. One of these was\r\nthe northeast angle of the Province of Sagadahock; the other is the\r\nnorthwest angle of Nova Scotia. It aright be debated which of the\r\nstreams that fall into Passamaquoddy Bay was the true St. Croix, but\r\nsuch a question could be settled by reference to evidence, and has been\r\nthus settled by the award of the commissioners under the fifth article\r\nof Jay's treaty. Among the many branches of a stream it may for a moment\r\nbe doubted which is to be considered as its principal source, but this\r\ncan be ascertained by proper methods, and it has been ascertained and\r\nmarked with a monument by the same commissioners. The tracing of a\r\nmeridian line may be a difficult operation in practical surveying, but\r\nit can be effected by proper instruments and adequate skill, and this\r\ntask has in fact been performed by one of the present commissioners,\r\nafter being attempted by the surveyors under the fifth article of the\r\ntreaty of Ghent. The highlands are defined in the commission of Governor\r\nWilmot and the proclamation of 1763 beyond the possibility of doubt.\r\nThey are on the north shore of the Bay of Chaleurs as described in the\r\none instrument, and on the western extremity of that bay as described\r\nby the other. They can therefore be found, and they have been found.\r\n\r\nThe Congress of 1779 and the framers of the treaty of 1783 were\r\ntherefore warranted in speaking of the northwest angle of Nova Scotia as\r\nif it were a known point. It could have been laid down with precision on\r\nany good map; it could be discovered by the use of adequate methods and\r\nthe expenditure of a sufficient appropriation; it was, in fact, as well\r\nknown as the forty-fifth and thirty-second parallels of latitude, which\r\nare named in the same article of the treaty, or as the boundaries of\r\nvery many of the States which had united in the Confederation. These\r\nwere defined by the course and sources of rivers--by parallels of\r\nlatitude and circles of longitude, either of indefinite extent or\r\nsetting out from some prescribed point whose position was to be\r\ndetermined. At the time of making these grants, as in the case before\r\nus, many of the boundaries had never been visited by civilized men. Some\r\nof these lines had, indeed, been sought and traced upon the ground in\r\npursuance of orders from the privy council of Great Britain or the high\r\ncourt of chancery, and the recollection of the operation was fresh in\r\nthe memory of both parties. Thus in 1750 it was ordered by the latter\r\ntribunal that the boundary on the lower counties on the Delaware (now\r\nthe State of that name) and the Province of Maryland should be marked\r\nout. The boundary was an arc of a circle described around the town of\r\nNewcastle, with a given radius, and a meridian line tangent thereto.\r\nThis was a far more difficult operation than to draw a meridian line\r\nfrom a given point, such as the source of a river. It was thought\r\nin 1763 worthy of the attention of the first assistant in the Royal\r\nObservatory at Greenwich, and the American Rittenhouse was associated\r\nwith him. This operation was not only of great contemporary fame, but\r\nis still quoted in English books among the data whence we derive our\r\nknowledge of the magnitude and figure of the earth. So also the same\r\nastronomer (Mason) had but a few years before the War of Independence\r\ncommenced the tracing of a parallel of latitude from the former line\r\nto the westward, thus marking the respective limits of Pennsylvania,\r\nMaryland, and Virginia. With such examples before them the framers of\r\nthe treaty of 1783 were warranted in considering the northwest angle\r\nof Nova Scotia as a point sufficiently definite to be made not merely\r\none of the landmarks of the new nation, but the corner at which the\r\ndescription of its boundaries should begin. It has been well remarked by\r\none of the commentators[52] on the report of Messrs. Featherstonhaugh\r\nand Mudge that if the treaty of 1783 be a grant the grantors are bound\r\nby rule of law to mark out that corner of their _own land_ whence the\r\ndescription of the grant commences. The British Government therefore\r\nought, if it be, as it is maintained on its part, a grant, to have\r\ntraced the line of highlands dividing their Provinces of Nova Scotia\r\nand Canada. Had this been done in conformity with the proclamation of\r\n1763 and the commission to Governor Wilmot, the northwest angle of Nova\r\nScotia would be given by the trace of the meridian of the St. Croix.\r\nSo far from doing this, the question has been complicated by the denial\r\nthat the boundaries defined in that proclamation and in the treaty of\r\n1783 were intended to be identical. The argument on this point was so\r\ningenious that the arbiter under the fifth article of the treaty of\r\nGhent did not consider the American case as made out,[53] and this doubt\r\nwas the principal ground on which his decision rested. It is therefore\r\nan earnest of a more favorable state of feeling that the sophistry with\r\nwhich this fact had been veiled, at least in part, is now withdrawn, and\r\nthat the commission whose report is under consideration frankly admit\r\nthis identity.[54] This admission being made, it is obvious that the\r\norigin of the highlands of the treaty must be sought on the north shore\r\nof the Bay des Chaleurs and at its western extremity, and it follows\r\nthat the point where this line of highlands is cut by the meridian of\r\nthe monument at the source of the St. Croix is the northwest angle of\r\nNova Scotia of the treaty of 1783, and must lie to the north of the\r\nRestigouche, or in the very spot claimed by the United States.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: Hon. John Holmes, of Maine.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: See Note VIII, p. 148.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: Report of Messrs. Featherstonhaugh and Mudge, pp. 6, 23.]\r\n\r\nThe British Government has not only failed in marking out the corner of\r\ntheir territory at which the boundary of the United States begins, but\r\nhas in practice adopted a very different point as the northwest angle of\r\nthe Province of New Brunswick, which now occupies the place of ancient\r\nNova Scotia in its contiguity to the American lines. Up to the time of\r\nthe discussion before the King of the Netherlands the commissions of the\r\ngovernors of New Brunswick had been, so far as the western and northern\r\nboundaries are concerned, copies of that to Governor Wilmot. The\r\nundersigned have no means of ascertaining when or how the form of these\r\ncommissions was changed, but it was found during the exploration of the\r\ncountry that the jurisdiction of New Brunswick, limited at least to the\r\nnorth of the St. John by the exploring meridian line, did not leave the\r\nBay of Chaleurs at its western extremity and follow thence the old\r\nbounds of the Province of Quebec. It, on the contrary, was ascertained\r\nthat it was limited by the Restigouche as far as the confluence of its\r\nsouthwestern branch, formerly known by the name of Chacodi, and thence\r\nfollowed the latter up to the point where it is crossed by the exploring\r\nmeridian line. On all the territory thus severed from the ancient domain\r\nof Nova Scotia permits to cut timber were found to have been issued by\r\nCanadian authorities, and the few settlers derived their titles to land\r\nfrom the same source.\r\n\r\nAlthough this demarcation involves a double deviation from the\r\nproclamation of 1763 (first, in following a river instead of highlands;\r\nsecond, in taking a small branch instead of pursuing the main supply\r\nof the Bay of Chaleurs), the northwest angle of Nova Scotia may be\r\nconsidered as at last fixed by British authority at a point many miles\r\nnorth of the point claimed to be such in the statements laid before\r\nthe King of the Netherlands on the part of Great Britain, and 48 miles\r\nto the north of where the line of \"abraded highlands\" of Messrs.\r\nFeatherstonhaugh and Mudge crosses the St. John. Were it not that the\r\nAmerican claim would be weakened by any change in the strong ground on\r\nwhich it has always rested, it might be granted that this is in fact the\r\nlong-lost northwest angle of Nova Scotia, and the highlands allowed to\r\nbe traced from that point through the sources of the branches of the\r\nSt. John and the St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\nIn proof of the position now assigned to this angle of New Brunswick,\r\nand consequently of ancient Nova Scotia, in the absence of documents\r\nwhich the archives of Great Britain alone can furnish, the map published\r\nby the Society for the Encouragement of Useful Knowledge, the several\r\nmaps of the surveyor-general of the Province of Canada, and the most\r\nrecent map of the Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, by John\r\nWyld, geographer to the Queen of Great Britain, may be cited.\r\n\r\nIt may therefore be concluded that the northwest angle of Nova Scotia\r\nis no longer an unknown point. It can be found by a search conducted\r\nin compliance with the proclamation of 1763 and the contemporaneous\r\ncommission of Governor Wilmot, and the researches of the present\r\ncommission show that it can not be far distant from the point originally\r\nassigned to it in the exploring meridian line. The identity of the first\r\nof these documents with the boundary of the treaty of 1783 is admitted,\r\nand the latter is word for word the same with the description of the\r\neastern boundary of the United States in the same treaty. Moreover, a\r\nnorthwest angle has been assigned to the Province of New Brunswick by\r\nBritish authority, which, did it involve no dereliction of principle,\r\nmight without sensible loss be accepted on the part of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--HIGHLANDS OF THE TREATY OF 1783.\r\n\r\nThe highlands of the treaty of 1783 are described as those \"which divide\r\nthose rivers that empty themselves into the river St. Lawrence from\r\nthose which fall into the Atlantic Ocean.\" It has been uniformly and\r\nconsistently maintained on the part of the United States that by the\r\nterm \"highlands\" was intended what is in another form of the same words\r\ncalled the height of land. The line of highlands in this sense was to be\r\nsought by following the rivers described in the treaty to their source\r\nand drawing lines between these sources in such manner as to divide the\r\nsurface waters. It was believed that the sources of such rivers as the\r\nConnecticut and the St. John must lie in a country sufficiently elevated\r\nto be entitled to the epithet of highlands, although it should appear on\r\nreaching it that it had the appearance of a plain. Nay, it was even\r\nconcluded, although, as now appears, incorrectly--and it was not feared\r\nthat the conclusion would weaken the American argument--that the line\r\nfrom the northwest angle of Nova Scotia, at least as far as the sources\r\nof Tuladi, did pass through a country of that description. Opposite\r\nground was taken in the argument of Great Britain by her agent, but\r\nhowever acute and ingenious were the processes of reasoning by which\r\nthis argument was supported, it remained in his hands without\r\napplication, for the line claimed by him on the part of his Government\r\nwas one having the same physical basis for its delineation as that\r\nclaimed by the agent of the United States, namely, one joining the\r\nculminating points of the valleys in which streams running in opposite\r\ndirections took their rise. The argument appears to have been drawn\r\nwhile he hoped to be able to include Katahdin and the other great\r\nmountains in that neighborhood in his claimed boundary, and he does not\r\nappear to have become aware how inapplicable it was in every sense to\r\nthe line by which he was, for want of a better, compelled to abide.\r\nThe British Government, however, virtually abandoned the construction\r\nof their agent in the convention signed in London the 27th September,\r\n1827.[55]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: See Note IX, p. 148.]\r\n\r\nIn this it was stipulated that Mitchell's and Map A should be admitted\r\nto the exclusion of all others \"as the only maps that shall be\r\nconsidered as evidence\" of the topography of the country, and in the\r\nlatter of these maps, constructed under the joint direction of the\r\nBritish and American negotiators by the astronomer of the British\r\nGovernment, it was agreed that nothing but the water courses should\r\nbe represented. Finally, it was admitted in the report of Messrs.\r\nFeatherstonhaugh and Mudge that the terms highlands and height of land\r\nare identical. The decision of the King of the Netherlands, to which\r\nGreat Britain gave her assent in the first instance, recognizes the\r\ncorrectness of the views entertained in the American statements.[56]\r\nAll discussion on this subject is, however, rendered unnecessary by the\r\nknowledge which the undersigned have obtained of the country. The line\r\nsurveyed by them not only divides rivers, but possesses in a preeminent\r\ndegree the character by which in the British argument highlands are\r\nrequired to be distinguished.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: See Note X, pp. 148, 149.]\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient for the present argument that the identity of the\r\nlines pointed out by the proclamation of 1763 and the act of 1774 with\r\nthe boundary of the treaty of 1783 be admitted. Such has been the\r\nuniform claim of the Government of the United States and the State\r\nof Massachusetts, and such is the deliberate verdict of the British\r\ncommissioners.[57] The words of the proclamation of 1763 have already\r\nbeen cited. By reference to them it will be seen that the origin of \"the\r\nhighlands\" is to be sought on the _north_ shore of the Bay of Chaleurs.\r\nIf they are not to be found there, a gap exists in the boundary of the\r\nproclamation, which it is evident could not have been intended. It has\r\nbeen thought by some that the gap did actually exist, but this idea was\r\nfounded on an imperfect knowledge of the country. The Bay of Chaleurs\r\nseems, in fact, to have been better known to the framers of the\r\nproclamation of 1763 and the act of 1774 than to any subsequent\r\nauthorities, whether British or American. Researches made in the year\r\n1840 show that at the head of the tide of the Bay of Chaleurs a mountain\r\nrises immediately on the northern bank, which from its imposing\r\nappearance has been called by the Scotch settlers at its foot Ben\r\nLomond. This, indeed, has by measurement been found to be no more than\r\n1,024 feet in height, but no one can deny its title to the name of a\r\nhighland. From this a continuous chain of heights has been ascertained\r\nto exist, bounding in the first instance the valley of the Matapediac\r\nto the sources of that stream, which they separate from those of the\r\nMetis. The height of land then passes between the waters of Metis and\r\nRestigouche, and, bending around the sources of the latter to the\r\nsources of the Rimouski, begins there to separate waters which fall into\r\nthe St. Lawrence from those which fall into the St. John, which they\r\ncontinue to do as far as the point where they merge in the line admitted\r\nby both parties.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: Report of Featherstonhaugh and Mudge, pp. 6, 23.]\r\n\r\nThese highlands have all the characteristics necessary to constitute\r\nthem the highlands of the treaty. Throughout their whole northern\r\nand western slopes flow streams which empty themselves into the St.\r\nLawrence. Beginning at the Bay of Chaleurs, they in the first place\r\ndivide, as it is necessary they should, waters which fall into that\r\nbay; they next separate the waters of Restigouche from those of Metis;\r\nthey then make a great detour to the south and inclose the valley\r\nof Rimouski, separating its waters from those of Matapediac and\r\nRestigouche, the Green River of St. John and Tuladi; they next perform a\r\ncircuit around Lake Temiscouata, separating its basin from those of the\r\nOtty and Trois Pistoles, until they reach the Temiscouata portage at\r\nMount Paradis. This portage they cross five times, and finally, bending\r\nbackward to the north, inclose the stream of the St. Francis, whose\r\nwaters they divide from those of Trois Pistoles, Du Loup, and the Green\r\nRiver of the St. Lawrence. Leaving the Temiscouata portage at the\r\nsixteenth milepost, a region positively mountainous is entered, which\r\ncharacter continues to the sources of the Etchemin. It there assumes for\r\na short space the character of a rolling country, no point in which,\r\nhowever, is less than 1,200 feet above the level of the sea. It speedily\r\nresumes a mountainous character, which continues unaltered to the\r\nsources of the Connecticut.\r\n\r\nNow it is maintained that all the streams and waters which have been\r\nnamed as flowing from the southern and eastern sides of this line are in\r\nthe intended sense of the treaty of 1783 rivers which empty themselves\r\ninto the Atlantic. The first argument adduced in support of this\r\nposition is that the framers of that treaty, having, as is admitted,\r\nMitchell's map before them, speak only of two classes of rivers--those\r\nwhich discharge themselves into the St. Lawrence River and those which\r\nfall into the Atlantic Ocean; yet upon this map were distinctly seen the\r\nSt. John and the Restigouche. The latter, indeed, figures twice--once\r\nas a tributary to the Bay of Miramichi and once as flowing to the Bay\r\nof Chaleurs.[58] It can not reasonably be pretended that men honestly\r\nengaged in framing an article to prevent \"all disputes which might arise\r\nin future\" should have intentionally passed over and left undefined\r\nthese important rivers, when by the simplest phraseology they might have\r\ndescribed them had they believed that in any future time a question\r\ncould have arisen whether they were included in one or the other of the\r\ntwo classes of rivers they named. Had it been intended that the due\r\nnorth line should have stopped short of the St. John, the highlands\r\nmust have been described as those which divide rivers which fall into\r\nthe St. Lawrence _and the St. John_ from those which fall into the\r\nAtlantic Ocean. The mouth of the St. Lawrence had been defined in the\r\nproclamation of 1763 by a line drawn from the river St. John (on the\r\nLabrador coast) to Cape Rozier. If, then, it had been intended that the\r\nmeridian line should not have crossed the Restigouche, the phraseology\r\nmust have been highlands which divide rivers which fall into the river\r\n_and_ Gulf of St. Lawrence from those which fall into the Atlantic\r\nOcean. Where such obvious modes of expressing either of these intentions\r\nexisted, it is not to be believed that they would have been omitted;\r\nbut had they been proposed to be introduced the American negotiators\r\nwould have been compelled by their instructions to refuse them. Such\r\nexpressions would have prescribed a boundary different not only in\r\nfact, but in terms, from that of the proclamation of 1763 and the\r\ncontemporaneous commission to Governor Wilmot. Either, then, the British\r\nplenipotentiaries admitted the American claim to its utmost extent or\r\nthey fraudulently assented to terms with the intention of founding upon\r\nthem a claim to territory which if they had openly asked for must have\r\nbeen denied them. The character of the British ministry under whose\r\ndirections that treaty was made forbids the belief of the latter having\r\nbeen intended. The members of that ministry had been when in opposition\r\nthe constant advocates of an accommodation with the colonies or of an\r\nhonorable peace after all hopes of retaining them in their allegiance\r\nhad ceased. They showed on coming into power a laudable anxiety to put\r\nan end to the profitless effusion of human blood, and they wisely saw\r\nthat it would be of more profit to their country to convert the new\r\nnation into friends by the free grant of terms which sooner or later\r\nmust have been yielded than to widen the breach of kindred ties by an\r\nirritating delay. The debates which ensued in the British Parliament\r\nwhen the terms of the treaty were made known show the view which the\r\nparty that had conducted the war entertained of this question. The\r\ngiving up of the very territory now in dispute was one of the charges\r\nmade by them against their successors, and that it had been given up by\r\nthe treaty was not denied. Nay, the effect of this admission was such\r\nas to leave the administration in a minority in the House of Commons,\r\nand thus became at least one of the causes of the resignation of the\r\nministry[59] by which the treaty had been made. At this very moment more\r\nmaps than one were published in London which exhibit the construction\r\nthen put upon the treaty by the British public. The boundary exhibited\r\nupon these maps is identical with that which the United States now claim\r\nand have always claimed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: See Note XI, p. 149.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Hansard's Parliamentary Register for 1783.]\r\n\r\nThe full avowal that the boundary of the treaty of 1783 and of the\r\nproclamation of 1763 and act of 1774 are identical greatly simplifies\r\nthe second argument. It has been heretofore maintained on the part of\r\nGreat Britain that the word \"sea\" of the two latter-named instruments\r\nwas not changed in the first to \"Atlantic Ocean\" without an obvious\r\nmeaning. All discussion on this point is obviated by the admission.\r\nBut it is still maintained that the Bay of Fundy is not a part of the\r\nAtlantic Ocean because it happens to be named in reference to the St.\r\nCroix in the same article of the treaty. To show the extent to which\r\nsuch an argument, founded on a mere verbal quibble, may be carried, let\r\nit be supposed that at some future period two nations on the continent\r\nof North America shall agree on a boundary in the following terms: By a\r\nline drawn through the Mississippi from its mouth in the Gulf of Mexico\r\nto its source; thence a parallel of latitude until it meet the highlands\r\nwhich divide the waters that empty themselves into the Pacific Ocean\r\nfrom those which fall into the Atlantic. Could it be pretended that\r\nbecause the mouth of the Mississippi is said to be in the Gulf of\r\nMexico the boundary must be transferred from the Rocky Mountains to\r\nthe Alleghanies? Yet this would be as reasonable as the pretensions\r\nso long set up by the British agents and commissioners.\r\n\r\nIt can not be denied that the line claimed by the United States fulfills\r\nat least one of the conditions. The streams which flow from one side of\r\nit fall without exception into the river St. Lawrence. The adverse line\r\nclaimed by Great Britain in the reference to the King of the Netherlands\r\ndivides until within a few miles of Mars Hill waters which fall into the\r\nSt. John from those of the Penobscot and Kennebec. The latter do not\r\ndischarge their waters directly into the ocean, but Sagadahock and\r\nPenobscot bays intervene, and the former falls into the Bay of Fundy;\r\nhence, according to the argument in respect to the Bay of Fundy, this\r\nline fulfills neither condition.\r\n\r\nThe line of Messrs. Featherstonhaugh and Mudge is even less in\r\nconformity to the terms of the treaty. In order to find mountains\r\nto form a part of it they are compelled to go south of the source of\r\nbranches of the Penobscot; thence from mountains long well known, at\r\nthe sources of the Alleguash, well laid down on the rejected map of\r\nMr. Johnson, it becomes entangled in the stream of the Aroostook, which\r\nit crosses more than once. In neither part does it divide waters at all.\r\nIt then, as if to make its discrepancy with the line defined in the\r\nproclamation of 1763 apparent, crosses the St. John and extends to the\r\n_south_ shore of the Bay of Chaleurs, although that instrument fixes the\r\nboundary of the Province of Quebec on the north shore of the bay. In\r\nthis part of its course it divides waters which fall into the said bay\r\nfrom those which fall into the St. John. But the proclamation with whose\r\nterms this line is said to be identical directs that the highlands shall\r\ndivide waters which fall into the St. Lawrence from those which fall\r\ninto the sea. If the branches of the Bay of Chaleurs fulfill the first\r\ncondition, which, however, is denied, the St. John must fulfill the\r\nlatter. It therefore falls into the Atlantic Ocean, and as the identity\r\nof the boundary of the treaty with that of the proclamation of 1763 and\r\nact of 1774 is admitted, then is the St. John an Atlantic river, and the\r\nline claimed by the United States fulfills both conditions, and is the\r\nonly line to the west of the meridian of the St. Croix which can\r\npossibly do so.\r\n\r\nThe choice of a line different from that presented to the choice of the\r\nKing of the Netherlands is no new instance of the uncertainty which has\r\naffected all the forms in which Great Britain has urged her claim.\r\n\r\nIn fact, nothing shows more conclusively the weakness of the ground on\r\nwhich the British claim rests than the continual changes which it has\r\nbeen necessary to make in order to found any feasible argument upon\r\nit.[60] In the discussion of 1798 it was maintained on the part of Great\r\nBritain that the meridian line must cross the St. John River; in the\r\nargument before the commissioners under the fifth article of the treaty\r\nof Ghent it was denied that it ever could have been the intention of the\r\nframers of the treaty of 1783 that it should. Yet the mouthpiece by\r\nwhich both arguments were delivered was one and the same person. The\r\nsame agent chose as the termination of what he attempted to represent\r\nas a continuous range of hills an isolated mountain, Mars Hill; and\r\nthe commissioners whose report is under consideration place a range of\r\nabraded highlands, \"the maximum axis of elevation,\" in a region over\r\nwhich British engineers have proposed to carry a railroad as the most\r\nlevel and lowest line which exists between St. Andrews and Quebec.[61]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: See Note XII, p. 149.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: Prospectus of St. Andrews and Quebec Railroad, 1836; and\r\nSurvey of Captain Yule, 1835.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the American claim, based on the only practicable\r\ninterpretation of the treaty of 1783, has been consistent throughout:\r\n\"Let the meridian line be extended until it meets the southern boundary\r\nof the Province of Quebec, as defined by the proclamation of 1763 and\r\nthe act of Parliament of 1774.\"\r\n\r\nNo argument can be drawn against the American claim from the secret\r\ninstructions of Congress dated August, 1779. All that is shown by\r\nthese instructions is the willingness to accept a more convenient\r\nboundary--one defined by a great natural feature, and which would have\r\nrendered the difficult operation of tracing the line of highlands and\r\nthat of determining the meridian of the St. Croix by astronomic methods\r\nunnecessary. The words of the instructions are:\r\n\r\n\"And east by a line to be drawn along the middle of the St. John from\r\nits source to its mouth in the Bay of Fundy, _or_ by a line to be\r\nsettled and adjusted between that part of the State of Massachusetts Bay\r\nformerly called the Province of Maine and the colony of Nova Scotia,\r\nagreeably to their respective rights, comprehending all islands within\r\n20 leagues of the shores of the United States and lying between lines to\r\nbe drawn due east from the points where the aforesaid boundaries between\r\nNova Scotia on the one part and East Florida on the other part shall\r\nrespectively touch the Bay of Fundy and the Atlantic Ocean.\"\r\n\r\nThe proposal in the first alternative was to appearance a perfectly fair\r\none. From an estimate made by Dr. Tiarks, the astronomer of Great\r\nBritain under the fifth article of the treaty of Ghent, in conformity\r\nwith directions from Colonel Barclay, the British commissioner, it was\r\nascertained that the whole disputed territory contained 10,705 square\r\nmiles; that the territory bounded by the St. John to its mouth contained\r\n707 square miles less, or 9,998 square miles. The difference at the time\r\nwas probably believed to be insensible. The first alternative was,\r\nhowever, rejected by Great Britain, and obviously on grounds connected\r\nwith a difference in supposed advantage between the two propositions.\r\nThe American commissioners were satisfied that they could urge no legal\r\nclaim along the coast beyond the river St. Croix; they therefore treated\r\non the other alternative in their instructions--the admitted limits\r\nbetween Massachusetts and Nova Scotia. Even in the former alternative,\r\nNova Scotia would still have had a northwest angle, for the very use of\r\nthe term shows that by the St. John its northwestern and not the\r\nsouthwestern branch was intended.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, when the interior of the country was unknown, the\r\nadoption of the St. John as the boundary, even admitting that the\r\nWalloostook, its southwestern branch, is the main stream, would have\r\ngiven to the United States a territory of more immediate value than\r\nthat they now claim. For this very reason the proposition was instantly\r\nrejected by Great Britain, and the State of Massachusetts was forced\r\nto be contented with the distant region now in debate--a region then\r\nbelieved to be almost inaccessible and hardly fit for human habitation.\r\n\r\nEven now, were there not vested private rights on both sides which might\r\nrender such a plan difficult of application, the undersigned would not\r\nhesitate to recommend that this line should be accepted in lieu of the\r\none which is claimed under the treaty of 1783.\r\n\r\nIt is finally obvious, from the most cursory inspection of any of the\r\nmaps of the territory in question, that the line claimed for Great\r\nBritain in the argument before the King of the Netherlands fulfills\r\nno more than one of the two conditions, while that of Messrs.\r\nFeatherstonhaugh and Mudge fulfills neither; and as the line claimed on\r\nthe part of the United States is denied to be capable of meeting the\r\nterms of the treaty of 1783 by Great Britain, there is no line that,\r\nin conformity with the British argument, can be drawn within the\r\ndisputed territory or its vicinity that will comply with either of\r\nthe conditions. This is as well and as distinctly shown in the map of\r\nMitchell as in the map of the British commission. It would therefore\r\nappear, if, these views be correct, that the framers of the treaty\r\nof 1783 went through the solemn farce of binding their respective\r\nGovernments to a boundary which they well knew did not and could not\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--NORTHWEST HEAD OF CONNECTICUT RIVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe true mode of determining the most northwesterly of any two given\r\npoints need no longer be a matter of discussion. It has already been\r\na matter adjudicated and assented to by both Governments, in the case\r\nof the Lake of the Woods. The point to be considered as most to the\r\nnorthwest is that which a ruler laid on a map drawn according to\r\nMercator's projection in a direction northeast and southwest and moved\r\nparallel to itself toward the northwest would last touch. In this view\r\nof the subject the Eastern Branch of the Connecticut, which forms the\r\nlake of that name, is excluded, for its source, so far from lying to the\r\nnorthwest of those of the other two branches which have been explored,\r\nactually lies to the south of the source of the Indian Stream. The\r\nquestion must therefore lie between the two others, and it is as yet\r\nimpossible to decide which of them is best entitled to the epithet, as\r\ntheir sources lie very nearly in the same northeast and southwest rhomb\r\nline. Another circumstance would, however, render the decision between\r\nthem easy. The forty-fifth parallel of latitude, as laid out by the\r\nsurveyors of the Provinces of Quebec and New York in conformity with\r\nthe proclamation of 1763, crosses Halls Stream above its junction with\r\nthe united current of the other two. In this case the latter is the\r\nConnecticut River of the treaty of 1783, and Halls Stream, which has\r\nnot yet joined it, must be excluded. The parallel, as corrected by the\r\nunited operations of the British and American astronomers under the\r\nfifth article of the treaty of Ghent, does not touch Halls Stream, and\r\nthe Connecticut River, to which it is produced, is the united current of\r\nthe three streams. If, then, the corrected parallel should become the\r\nboundary between the United States and the British Provinces, Halls\r\nStream must become one of those the claim of whose source to the title\r\nof the north-westernmost head of Connecticut River is to be examined.\r\nAnd here it may be suggested, although with the hesitation that is\r\nnatural in impeaching such high authority, that the commissioners under\r\nthe fifth article of the treaty of Ghent in all probability misconstrued\r\nthat instrument when they reopened the question of the forty-fifth\r\nparallel. It can not be said that the forty-fifth degree of latitude had\r\n\"_not been surveyed_\" when it is notorious that it had been traced and\r\nmarked throughout the whole extent from St. Regis to the bank of the\r\nConnecticut River.\r\n\r\nIn studying, for the purpose of illustration, the history of this part\r\nof the boundary line it will be found that a change was made in it by\r\nthe Quebec act of 1774. The proclamation of 1763 directs the forty-fifth\r\nparallel to be continued only until it meets highlands, while in that\r\nbill the Connecticut River is made the boundary of the Province of\r\nQuebec. Now the earlier of these instruments was evidently founded upon\r\nthe French claim to extend their possession of Canada 10 leagues from\r\nthe St. Lawrence River, and from the citadel of Quebec, looking to the\r\nsouth, are seen mountains whence rivers flow to the St. Lawrence. On\r\ntheir opposite slope there was a probability that streams might flow to\r\nthe Atlantic. These mountains, however, are visibly separated from those\r\nover which the line claimed by the United States runs by a wide gap.\r\nThis is the valley of the Chaudiere; and the St. Francis also rises on\r\nthe southeastern side of these mountains and makes its way through them.\r\nIt is not, therefore, in any sense a dividing ridge. Yet under the\r\nproclamation of 1763 the Provinces of New York and New Hampshire claimed\r\nand were entitled to the territory lying behind it, which is covered by\r\ntheir royal charters. The Quebec act, it would appear, was intended to\r\ndivest them of it, and according to the construction of the treaty of\r\n1783 now contended for the United States acquiesced in this diminution\r\nof the territory of those members of the Union. If, however, it be true,\r\nas maintained by Messrs. Featherstonhaugh and Mudge, that the highlands\r\nseen to the south of Quebec are a portion of the ridge seen from\r\nsoutheast to northeast, and if, as they maintain, so deep and wide a\r\nvalley as that of the St. John is no disruption of the continuity of\r\nhighlands, it would be possible to show that the highlands of the treaty\r\nof 1783 are made up of these two ridges of mountains and that the United\r\nStates is entitled to the whole of the eastern townships. This range of\r\nhighlands would coincide with the terms of the proclamation of 1763 by\r\nterminating on the north shore of the Bay of Chaleurs, while the abraded\r\nhighlands of Messrs. Featherstonhaugh and Mudge terminate on its south\r\nshore. In fact, there is no step in their argument which might not be\r\nadduced to support this claim, nor any apparent absurdity in preferring\r\nit which would not find its parallel in one or other of the positions\r\nthey assume.\r\n\r\nIn this view of the history of this part of the line it becomes evident,\r\nhowever, that in divesting the Provinces of New York and New Hampshire\r\nby the Quebec act of territory admitted to belong to them in the\r\nproclamation of 1763 the British Parliament must have intended to make\r\nthe encroachment as small as possible, and the first important branch of\r\nthe Connecticut met with in tracing the forty-fifth parallel must have\r\nbeen intended. This intention is fully borne out by the words of the\r\ntreaty of 1783, which chose from among the branches of the Connecticut\r\nthat whose source is farthest to the northwest.\r\n\r\nIt has therefore been shown in the foregoing statement--\r\n\r\n1. That the river to be considered as the St. Croix and its true source\r\nhave been designated by a solemn act, to which the good faith of the\r\nmajesty of Great Britain and of the people of the United States is\r\npledged, and can not now be disturbed.\r\n\r\n2. That the boundary line must, in compliance with the provisions of the\r\ntreaty of 1783, be drawn due north from the source of that river, and in\r\nno other direction whatever.\r\n\r\n3. That the northwest angle of Nova Scotia was a point sufficiently\r\nknown at the date of the treaty of 1783 to be made the starting point\r\nof the boundary of the United States; that it was both described in the\r\ntreaty and defined, without being named in previous official acts of the\r\nBritish Government, in so forcible a manner that no difficulty need have\r\nexisted in finding it.\r\n\r\n4. That the line of highlands claimed by the United States is, as the\r\nargument on the part of Great Britain has maintained it ought to be, in\r\na mountainous region, while that proposed by Messrs. Featherstonhaugh\r\nand Mudge does not possess this character; that it is also, in the sense\r\nuniformly maintained by the United States, the height of land, which\r\nthat of Messrs. Featherstonhaugh and Mudge is not; that it fulfills in\r\nevery sense the conditions of the proclamation of 1763, the Quebec act\r\nof 1774, and the treaty of 1783, which no other line that can possibly\r\nbe drawn in the territory in question can perform.\r\n\r\n5. That as far as the Indian Stream and that flowing through Lake\r\nConnecticut are concerned, the source of the former must in the sense\r\nestablished by the assent of both parties be considered as the\r\nnorthwestern source of the Connecticut River, but that if the old\r\ndemarcation of the forty-fifth parallel be disturbed the question must\r\nlie between the sources of Halls and of Indian streams.\r\n\r\nAll which is respectfully submitted.\r\n\r\nJAS.

And both parties agree to consider such\r\ndecision as final and conclusive, so as that the same shall never\r\nthereafter be called into question or made the subject of dispute or\r\ndifference between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note II_.\r\n\r\nDeclaration of the commissioners under the fifth article of the treaty\r\nof 1794 between the United States and Great Britain, respecting the true\r\nriver St. Croix, by Thomas Barclay, David Howell, and Egbert Benson,\r\ncommissioners appointed in pursuance of the fifth article of the treaty\r\nof amity, commerce, and navigation between His Britannic Majesty and the\r\nUnited States of America finally to decide the question \"What river was\r\ntruly intended under the name of the river St. Croix mentioned in the\r\ntreaty of peace between His Majesty and the United States, and forming\r\na part of the boundary therein described?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDECLARATION.\r\n\r\nWe, the said commissioners, having been sworn impartially to examine\r\nand decide the said question according to such evidence as should\r\nrespectively be laid before us on the part of the British Government and\r\nof the United States, respectively, appointed and authorized to manage\r\nthe business on behalf of the respective Governments, have decided,\r\nand hereby do decide, the river hereinafter particularly described and\r\nmentioned to be the river truly intended under the name of the river St.\r\nCroix in the said treaty of peace, and forming a part of the boundary\r\ntherein described; that is to say, the mouth of the said river is in\r\nPassamaquoddy Bay at a point of land called Joes Point, about 1 mile\r\nnorthward from the northern part of St. Andrews Island, and in the\r\nlatitude of 45° 5' and 5\" north, and in the longitude of 67° 12' and 30\"\r\nwest from the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, in Great Britain, and 3°\r\n54' and 15\" east from Harvard College, in the University of Cambridge,\r\nin the State of Massachusetts; and the course of the said river up from\r\nits said mouth is northerly to a point of land called the Devils Head;\r\nthen, turning the said point, is westerly to where it divides into\r\ntwo streams, the one coming from the westward and the other from the\r\nnorthward, having the Indian name of Cheputnatecook, or Chebuitcook, as\r\nthe same may be variously spelt; then up the said stream so coming from\r\nthe northward to its source, which is at a stake near a yellow-birch\r\ntree hooped with iron and marked S.T. and J.H., 1797, by Samuel Titcomb\r\nand John Harris, the surveyors employed to survey the above-mentioned\r\nstream coming from the northward.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note III_.\r\n\r\n[Article V of the treaty of Ghent, 1814.]\r\n\r\nWhereas neither that point of the highlands lying due north from the\r\nsource of the river St. Croix, and designated in the former treaty of\r\npeace between the two powers as the northwest angle of Nova Scotia, nor\r\nthe northwesternmost head of Connecticut River has yet been ascertained;\r\nand whereas that part of the boundary line between the dominions of the\r\ntwo powers which extends from the source of the river St. Croix directly\r\nnorth to the above-mentioned northwest angle of Nova Scotia; thence\r\nalong the said highlands which divide those rivers that empty themselves\r\ninto the river St. Lawrence from those which fall into the Atlantic\r\nOcean, to the northwesternmost head of Connecticut River; thence down\r\nalong the middle of that river to the forty-fifth degree of north\r\nlatitude; thence by a line due west on said latitude until it strikes\r\nthe river Iroquois, or Cataraquy, has not yet been surveyed, it is\r\nagreed that for these several purposes two commissioners shall be\r\nappointed, sworn, and authorized to act exactly in the manner directed\r\nwith respect to those mentioned in the next preceding article, unless\r\notherwise specified in the present article. The said commissioners shall\r\nmeet at St. Andrews, in the Province of New Brunswick, and shall have\r\npower to adjourn to such other place or places as they shall think fit.\r\nThe said commissioners shall have power to ascertain and determine the\r\npoints above mentioned in conformity with the provisions of the said\r\ntreaty of peace of 1783, and shall cause the boundary aforesaid, from\r\nthe source of the river St. Croix to the river Iroquois, or Cataraquy,\r\nto be surveyed and marked according to the said provisions. The said\r\ncommissioners shall make a map of the said boundary, and annex to it a\r\ndeclaration under their hands and seals certifying it to be the true map\r\nof the said boundary, and particularizing the latitude and longitude\r\nof the northwest angle of Nova Scotia, of the northwesternmost head of\r\nConnecticut River, and of such other points of the said boundary as\r\nthey may deem proper; and both parties agree to consider such map and\r\ndeclaration as finally and conclusively fixing the said boundary. And in\r\nthe event of the said two commissioners differing, or both or either of\r\nthem refusing, declining, or willfully omitting to act, such reports,\r\ndeclarations, or statements shall be made by them or either of them, and\r\nsuch reference to a friendly sovereign or state shall be made in all\r\nrespects as in the latter part of the fourth article is contained, and\r\nin as full a manner as if the same was herein repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note IV_.\r\n\r\nThe point originally chosen by the commissioners in 1798 as the source\r\nof the St. Croix was to all appearance the act of an umpire who wished\r\nto reconcile two contending claims by giving to each party about half\r\nthe matter in dispute. No one who compares Mitchell's map with that of\r\nMessrs. Featherstonhaugh and Mudge can fail to recognize in the St.\r\nCroix of the former the Magaguadavic of the latter. That this was the\r\nSt. Croix intended by the framers of the treaty of 1783 was maintained,\r\nand, it may be safely asserted, proved on the American side. On the\r\nother hand, it was ascertained that the river called St. Croix by De\r\nMonts was the Schoodiac; and the agent of Great Britain insisted that\r\nthe letter of the instrument was to be received as the only evidence, no\r\nmatter what might have been the intentions of the framers. The American\r\nargument rested on the equity of the case, the British on the strict\r\nlegal interpretation of the document. The commissioners were divided in\r\nopinion, each espousing the cause of his country. In this position of\r\nthings the umpire provided for in the treaty of 1794 was chosen, and\r\nin the United States it has always been believed unfortunately for her\r\npretensions. A lawyer of eminence, who had reached the seat of a judge,\r\nfirst of a State court and then of a tribunal of the General Government,\r\nhe prided himself on his freedom from the influence of feeling in his\r\ndecisions. As commissioner for the settlement of the boundary between\r\nthe States of New York and Vermont, he had offended the former, of which\r\nhe was a native, by admitting the claim of the latter in its full\r\nextent, and it was believed that he would rather encounter the odium of\r\nhis fellow-citizens than run the risk of being charged with partiality\r\ntoward them. Colonel Barclay, the British commissioner, who concurred\r\nin choosing him as umpire, had been his schoolfellow and youthful\r\nassociate, and it is believed in the United States that he concurred in,\r\nif he did not prompt, the nomination from a knowledge of this feature\r\nof character. Had he, as is insinuated by Messrs. Featherstonhaugh and\r\nMudge, been inclined to act with partiality toward his own country, he\r\nhad most plausible grounds for giving a verdict in her favor, and that\r\nhe did not found his decisions upon them is evidence of a determination\r\nto be impartial, which his countrymen have said was manifested in a\r\nleaning to the opposite side. Those who suspect him of being biased by\r\nimproper motives must either be ignorant of the circumstances of the\r\ncase or else incapable of estimating the purity of the character of\r\nEgbert Benson. His award, however, has nothing to do with the question,\r\nas it was never acted upon. Both parties were dissatisfied with the\r\nconclusions at which he arrived, and in consequence a conventional\r\nline in which both concurred was agreed upon, and the award of the\r\ncommissioners was no more than a formal act to make this convention\r\nbinding.\r\n\r\nIf, then, both Governments should think it expedient to unsettle the\r\nvested rights which have arisen out of the award of 1798, there is a\r\nstrong and plausible ground on which the United States may claim the\r\nMagaguadavic as their boundary, and the meridian line of its source\r\nwill throw the valley of the St. John from Woodstock to the Grand\r\nFalls within the limits of the State of Maine. While, therefore, it\r\nis maintained that it would violate good faith to reopen the question,\r\nthere is good reason to hope that an impartial umpire would decide it\r\nso as to give the United States the boundary formerly claimed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note V_.\r\n\r\nThe angle made by the southern boundary of the Province of Quebec with\r\nthe due north line from the source of the St. Croix first appeared in an\r\nEnglish dress in the commission to Governor Wilmot. This was probably\r\nintended to be identical in its meaning with the terms in the Latin\r\ngrant to Sir William Alexander, although there is no evidence to that\r\neffect. If, therefore, it were a false translation, the error has been\r\ncommitted on the side of Great Britain, and not on that of the United\r\nStates. But it is not a false translation, as may be shown to the\r\nsatisfaction of the merest tyro in classical literature.\r\n\r\nThe words of the grant to Sir William Alexander, as quoted by Messrs.\r\nFeatherstonhaugh and Mudge, are as follows, viz:\r\n\r\n\"Omnes et singulas terras continentis ac insulas situatas et jacentes in\r\nAmerica intra caput seu promontorium communiter _Cap de Sable_ appellat,\r\njacen. prope latitudinem quadraginta trium graduum aut eo circa ab\r\nequinoctiali linea versus septentrionem, a quo promontorio versus littus\r\nmaris tenden, ad occidentem ad stationem Sanctae Mariae navium vulgo\r\n_Sanctmareis Bay_.

Mudge and Featherstonhaugh is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"All and each of the lands of the continent and the islands situated\r\nand lying in America within the headland or promontory commonly called\r\nCape Sable, lying near the forty-third degree of latitude from the\r\nequinoctial line or thereabout; from which promontory stretching\r\nwestwardly toward the north by the seashore to the naval station of\r\nSt. Mary, commonly called St. Marys Bay; from thence passing toward the\r\nnorth by a straight line, the entrance or mouth of that great naval\r\nstation which penetrates the interior of the eastern shore betwixt the\r\ncountries of the Suriquois and Etchemins, to the river commonly called\r\nthe St. Croix, and to the most remote source or spring of the same on\r\nthe western side which first mingles itself with the aforesaid river;\r\nfrom whence, by an imaginary straight line, which may be supposed\r\n(concipietur) to advance into the country or to run toward the north to\r\nthe nearest naval station, river, or spring discharging itself into the\r\ngreat river of Canada and from thence advancing toward the east by the\r\ngulf shores of the said river of Canada to the river, naval station,\r\nport, or shore commonly known or called by the name of Gathepe or\r\nGaspe.\"\r\n\r\nThe only American translations which have ever been presented in\r\nargument are as follows:\r\n\r\n[Translation of Messrs. Gallatin and Preble, who were employed to\r\nprepare the statement laid before the King of the Netherlands.]\r\n\r\n\"Beginning at Cape Sable, in 43° north latitude or thereabout; extending\r\nthence westwardly along the seashore to the road commonly called St.\r\nMarys Bay; thence toward the north by a direct line, crossing the\r\nentrance or mouth of that great ship road which runs into the eastern\r\ntract of land between the territories of the Souriquois and of the\r\nEtchemins (Bay of Fundy), to the river commonly called St. Croix, and\r\nto the most remote spring or source which from the western part thereof\r\nfirst mingles itself with the river aforesaid; and from thence, by an\r\nimaginary direct line, which may be conceived to stretch through the\r\nland or to run toward the north, to the nearest road, river, or spring\r\nemptying itself into the great river de Canada (river St. Lawrence); and\r\nfrom thence, proceeding eastwardly along the seashores of the said river\r\nde Canada, to the river, road, port, or shore commonly known and called\r\nby the name of Gathepe or Gaspe.\"\r\n\r\n[Translation of Mr. Bradley, the American agent under the fifth article\r\nof the treaty of Ghent.]\r\n\r\n\"By the tenor of this our present charter we do give, grant, and convey\r\nto the said Sir William Alexander, his heirs or assigns, all and\r\nsingular the lands of the continent and islands situated and lying in\r\nAmerica within the headland or promontory commonly called Cape Sable,\r\nlying near the latitude of 43° or thereabout, from the equinoctial line\r\ntoward the north; from which promontory stretching toward the shore of\r\nthe sea to the west to the road of ships commonly called St. Marys Bay,\r\nand then toward the north by a direct line, crossing the entrance or\r\nmouth of that great road of ships which runs into the eastern tract of\r\nland between the territories of the Souriquois and the Etchemins, to the\r\nriver called by the name of St. Croix, and to the most remote spring or\r\nfountain from the western part thereof which first mingles itself with\r\nthe river aforesaid; whence, by an imaginary direct line, which may be\r\nconceived to go through or run toward the north, to the nearest road of\r\nships, river, or spring emptying itself into the great river of Canada;\r\nand from thence proceeding toward the east by the shores of the sea of\r\nthe said river of Canada to the river, road of ships, or shore commonly\r\nknown and called by the name of Gachepe or Gaspe.\"\r\n\r\nBut the translations of the Americans were merely for form's sake, as\r\nthe original Latin, in a copy furnished from a British public office,\r\nwas laid before the King of the Netherlands; and no fear need have been\r\nfelt that the umpire would not have been able to judge whether the\r\ntranslations were true or not. It was rather to be inferred that he, in\r\nexamining a question submitted in a language foreign to him, would have\r\nfound the Latin quite as intelligible as the English. This examination,\r\nhowever, is wholly superfluous.\r\n\r\nFrom whatever source the negotiators of the treaty of 1783 derived their\r\nview of the boundary, that instrument directs that it shall be a due\r\nnorth line from the source of the river St. Croix. This expression is\r\ntoo definite to require explanation or illustration, and it is only for\r\nthose purposes that any other instrument can be permitted to be quoted.\r\n\r\nIn the passages referred to the words \"versus septentrionem\" occur three\r\ntimes, and in two of the instances are qualified by the context in such\r\nmanner as to leave no possible doubt as to the meaning. The first time\r\nthey occur the words of the passage are, \"prope latitudinem quadraginta\r\ntrium graduum aut eo circa versus septentrionem.\" The free translation\r\ninto modern idiom is beyond doubt, \"near the forty-third degree of north\r\nlatitude or thereabout;\" and the direction toward the north must be\r\nalong a meridian line on which latitude is measured, or due north.\r\nMessrs. Mudge and Featherstonhaugh, instead of connecting in their\r\ntranslation the words \"versus septentrionem\" with the words \"prope\r\nlatitudinem,\" etc., with which they stand in juxtaposition in the Latin\r\ntext which they quote, connect them with the words \"ad occidentem\r\ntendentem,\" which occur in the next clause of the sentence, even\r\naccording to their own punctuation. We note this as a false translation,\r\nalthough it does not touch the point in dispute. They have, indeed,\r\nattempted to use it in their argument; but even if the use they make\r\nof it had been successful their inferences fall, because drawn from\r\nerroneous premises.\r\n\r\nThe second clause in which the words occur is as follows: \"Ad stationem\r\nnavium Sanctae Mariae vulgo St. Marys Bay, et deinceps versus\r\nseptentrionem per directam lineam introitum sive ostium magnae illius\r\nstationis navium trajicientem,\" etc., \"ad fluvium vulgo nomine Sanctae\r\nCrucis appellatum.\" Here the line, although directed to be drawn toward\r\nthe north, is also directed to be drawn between two given points, and it\r\nis clear that under the double direction, if they should differ from\r\neach other, the position of the given points must govern, and the line\r\nbe traced from one of them to the other, no matter what may be their\r\nbearings.\r\n\r\nThe last time the words occur is after the direction that the line shall\r\npass up the St. Croix and to the most remote western spring or fountain\r\nof that stream, \"unde per imaginariam lineam directam quae pergere per\r\nterram seu currere versus septentrionem concipietur.\" Here alone can any\r\ndoubt exist as to the meaning of the terms, and that is easily solved.\r\n\r\nThe boundary pointed out in the instrument is \"such as may be conceived\r\nto go or run toward the north by (per) a direct (directam) line.\" Now a\r\ndirect line toward the north can be no other than a meridian line. Had\r\nit been merely a straight line of vague northerly direction which was\r\nmeant, _rectum_, the usual expression for a mathematical straight line,\r\nwould have been used instead of _directam_. It is, moreover, to be\r\nconsidered that the Romans had names both for the northeast and\r\nnorthwest points of the compass, and that the expression \"versus\r\nseptentrionem\" in its most vague application could not possibly have\r\nadmitted of a deviation of more than two points on either hand. Had the\r\ndirection intended deviated more than that amount from the true north,\r\nthe Latin term corresponding to northeast or northwest must have been\r\nused. Nor is this a matter of mere surmise, for in a passage immediately\r\nfollowing that which has been quoted the direction through the Gulf\r\nof St. Lawrence toward Cape Breton is denoted by the term \"versus\r\nEuronotum,\" leaving no possibility of doubt that had the line directed\r\nto be drawn from the source of the St. Croix been intended to have\r\na northwestern bearing the appropriate Latin words would have been\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nIt is, besides, to be recollected that the instrument was drawn by a\r\nperson using habitually and thinking in a modern idiom, and that in\r\ntranslating the English words due north into Latin no other possible\r\nexpression could suggest itself than the one employed. Such, then,\r\nwas the sense appropriately given to the Latin words, first in the\r\ncommission of Governor Wilmot and his successors, governors of Nova\r\nScotia, and subsequently in the commission of all the governors of New\r\nBrunswick from the time that it was erected into a province until the\r\nquestion was referred to the King of the Netherlands. In this reference,\r\nalthough a translation was given in the American argument, it was not as\r\nquoted by Messrs. Featherstonhaugh and Mudge, but was in the words which\r\nhave already been cited.\r\n\r\nConnected with this subject, although, like it, wholly irrelevant, is\r\nanother conclusion which Messrs. Mudge and Featherstonhaugh attempt to\r\ndraw from the same grant to Sir William Alexander. That charter directs\r\nthe line \"versus septentrionem\" to be produced \"ad proximam navium\r\nstationem, fluvium, vel scaturiginem in magno fluvio de Canada sese\r\nexonerantem.\" It can hardly be credited that, although a literal\r\ntranslation of this passage is given, including the whole of the three\r\nterms naval station, river, _or_ spring, that it is attempted to limit\r\nthe meaning to the first expression only, and to infer that as Quebec,\r\nin their opinion, is the first naval station above Gaspe on the St.\r\nLawrence, the line \"versus septentrionem\" was intended to be drawn\r\ntoward that place, but that as \"spring\" is also mentioned the line\r\nmust stop at the source of the Chaudiere. Now it has been uniformly\r\nmaintained by British authorities, and most strongly in the discussion\r\nwhich preceded the War of 1756, that Nova Scotia extended to the St.\r\nLawrence. The boundary of Sir William Alexander's grant was therefore to\r\nbe changed from a geographical line to a water course as soon as it met\r\nwith one, and the apparently useless verbiage was introduced to meet\r\nevery possible contingency. Supposing, however, that it did not extend\r\nso far, the northwest angle of his Nova Scotia will be where the\r\nmeridian line of the St. Croix crosses the Beaver Stream running into\r\nLake Johnson, only a mile to the north of the point maintained by the\r\nAmerican claim to be such.\r\n\r\nThe map of L'Escarbot, quoted by Messrs. Mudge and Featherstonhaugh,\r\nillustrates both this point and the second instance in which the term\r\n\"versus septentrionem\" is employed. On that map, due north of the Bay\r\nof St. Marys, a deep inlet of the Bay of Fundy is represented, and,\r\ncontinuing in the same direction, a deep inlet of the St. Lawrence is\r\nfigured. The latter does not exist, but this map shows that it was\r\nbelieved to exist at the time of the grant, and must be the \"statio\r\nnavium\" of that instrument.\r\n\r\nThis inlet of the Bay of Fundy occupies the position of the St. John,\r\nwhich is almost due north by the most recent determination from St.\r\nMarys Bay, and is so represented on their own map. That the St. John\r\nwas by mistake arising from this cause taken for the St. Croix in the\r\ncharter to Alexander is obvious from its being described as lying\r\nbetween the territories of the Etchemin and Souriquois. Now Etchemin, or\r\ncanoe men, is the name given by the Micmac Indians to the race of the\r\nAbenakis, from their skill in the management of the canoe; and this race\r\nhas always inhabited the river, whence one of their tribes is still\r\ncalled St. John's Indians. The language of this tribe, although they\r\nhave lived apart for many years, is still perfectly intelligible by the\r\nIndians of the Penobscot, and those in the service of the commission\r\nconversed with perfect ease with the Indians of Tobique. Massachusetts,\r\nthen, was right in claiming to the St. John as the eastern limit of\r\nthe grant to Sir William Alexander, being the stream understood and\r\ndescribed in it under the name of St. Croix, and wholly different from\r\nthe river known to the French under that name. If, therefore, Great\r\nBritain should insist that the question in relation to the St. Croix\r\nshall be reopened, the United States would be able to maintain in the\r\nvery terms of the original grant to Alexander (on which the British\r\nargument in 1797 rested) that the St. John is the St. Croix, and the\r\nboundary will be that river to its most northwestern source, the\r\nAsherbish, which flows into the upper end of Lake Temiscouata. Nova\r\nScotia will then have recovered her lost northwest angle, which can not\r\nbe found in any of the many shapes under which the British argument has\r\nbeen presented, although it forms the place of beginning of what is\r\ncalled a grant to the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note VI_.\r\n\r\nThe fact that a line drawn from the source of the Kennebec to the mouth\r\nof the Chaudiere or thereabout must be one of the boundary lines of\r\nthe grant to the Duke of York has not escaped the notice of Messrs.\r\nFeatherstonhaugh and Mudge; but they have not derived the true result\r\nfrom this discovery. The Kennebec being the western limit of the grant,\r\nthe line in question bounds the territory on the southwest, while they\r\ninfer that it bounds it on the northeast. In making this inference they\r\nappear to have forgotten that the St. Croix is the eastern boundary of\r\nthe grant. By their argument the grant to the Duke of York is blotted\r\nwholly from the map, or, rather, becomes a mathematical line which is\r\nabsurd.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note VII_.\r\n\r\nNo name which has ever been applied to any part of North America is as\r\nvague as that of Acadie. The charter to De Monts in 1604 extended from\r\nthe fortieth to the forty-sixth degree of north latitude; that is to\r\nsay, from Sandy Hook, at the mouth of the Hudson, to the peninsula of\r\nNova Scotia. It therefore included New York, parts of New Jersey and\r\nPennsylvania, and all the New England States, but excluded the disputed\r\nterritory. His settlement was at the mouth of the St. Croix, but\r\nwas speedily removed to Port Royal. The latter place was soon after\r\ndestroyed by an expedition from Virginia under Argall. Under the title\r\nderived from this conquest it would appear probable that the celebrated\r\ngrant to Sir William Stirling was made; but when his agents attempted\r\nto make settlements in the country they found that the French had\r\npreoccupied it. Although the son of Alexander succeeded in conquering\r\nthe country granted to his father, and even beyond it to the Penobscot,\r\nit was restored to France by the treaty of St. Germains in 1634, and the\r\nAlexanders were indemnified for the loss by the Crown of England.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent cessions to France after its occupations by the arms\r\nof Massachusetts, and in its final cession to Great Britain by the\r\ntreaty of Utrecht in 1713, the country ceded is described as Acadie or\r\nNova Scotia, with its ancient bounds (_cum finibus antiquis_). The\r\nuncertainty arising from this vague description became in 1750 a subject\r\nof controversy between France and England, and was one of the causes\r\nwhich led to the war of 1756. In this discussion both parties admitted\r\nthat the names Acadie and Nova Scotia were convertible terms. England\r\nmaintained that the territory thus named extended to the St. Lawrence;\r\nthe French, on the other hand, insisted that their Acadie had never\r\nextended more than 10 leagues from the Bay of Fundy; while by\r\ngeographers, as quoted by the British commissioners, the name was\r\nlimited to the peninsula which forms the present Province of Nova\r\nScotia.[62] If Acadie had been limited to the north by the forty-sixth\r\ndegree of north latitude, as expressed in the charter of De Monts,\r\nthat parallel is to the south of Mars Hill. The British Government,\r\ntherefore, derives no title to the disputed territory from this source,\r\nas the title of Massachusetts and of Maine as her successor is admitted\r\nto all country south of that parallel.[63]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: Report of Featherstonhaugh and Mudge, p. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: It can not be seriously pretended that when by the treaty\r\nof St. Germains, in 1632, Acadie was restored to France the intention\r\nwas to cede to her the colonies already settled in New England. Yet the\r\nlanguage of the British commissioners would imply that this was the case\r\nwere it not that they evidently consider the forty-sixth parallel as the\r\nsouthern boundary of the grant to De Monts, whereas it is the northern.]\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to tell what country was actually settled by the French\r\nas Acadie. Its chief town was Port Royal, now Annapolis, at the head of\r\nthe Bay of Fundy. Nearly all the settlements of the Acadians were in\r\nthat vicinity, and for the most part within the peninsula.\r\n\r\nFrom these seats they were removed in 1756 by Great Britain, and to\r\nthem a remnant was permitted to return. The most western settlement of\r\nAcadians was on the St. John River near the present site of Fredericton,\r\nand no permanent occupation was ever made by them of country west of the\r\nSt. Croix. It is even doubtful whether the settlement near Fredericton\r\nwas a part of French Acadie, for it seems to have been formed by persons\r\nwho escaped from the general seizure and transportation of their\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nThis settlement was broken up in 1783, and its inhabitants sought refuge\r\nat Madawaska; but it can not be pretended that this forced removal of\r\nAcadians subsequent to the treaty of 1783 was an extension of the name\r\nof their country. The whole argument in favor of the British claim\r\nfounded on the limits of ancient Acadie therefore fails:\r\n\r\nFirst. Because of the inherent vagueness of the term, on which no\r\nsettled understanding was ever had, although England held it to be\r\nsynonymous with Nova Scotia and France denied that it extended more\r\nthan 10 leagues from the Bay of Fundy.\r\n\r\nSecond. Because by its original definition in the grant to De Monts it\r\nexcludes the whole disputed territory on the one side; and\r\n\r\nThird. Because in its practical sense, as a real settlement, it is\r\nwholly to the east of the meridian of the St. Croix, and this excludes\r\nthe whole of the disputed territory on the other.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the territory granted to the Duke of York, and which is\r\nnow the subject of dispute, therefore can not be claimed as a part of\r\nAcadie, as it never fell within its limits either by charter or by\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note VIII_.\r\n\r\n[Extract from the award of the King of the Netherlands.]\r\n\r\nConsidering that in 1763, 1765, 1773, and 1782 it was established that\r\nNova Scotia should be bounded at the north as far as the western\r\nextremity of the Bay des Chaleurs by the southern boundary of the\r\nProvince of Quebec; that this delimitation is again found with respect\r\nto the Province of Quebec in the commission of the Governor-General of\r\nQuebec of 1786, wherein the language of the proclamation of 1763 and of\r\nthe Quebec act of 1774 has been used, as also in the commissions of 1786\r\nand others of subsequent dates of the governors of New Brunswick, with\r\nrespect to the last-mentioned Province, as well as in a great number\r\nof maps anterior and posterior to the treaty of 1783; and that the\r\nfirst article of the said treaty specifies by name the States whose\r\nindependence is acknowledged; but that this mention does not imply\r\n(_implique_) the entire coincidence of the boundaries between the\r\ntwo powers, as settled by the following article, with the ancient\r\ndelimitation of the British Provinces, whose preservation is not\r\nmentioned in the treaty of 1783, and which, owing to its continual\r\nchanges and the uncertainty which continued to exist respecting it,\r\ncreated from time to time differences between the provincial\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note IX_.\r\n\r\n[Article IV of the convention of 1827.]\r\n\r\nThe map called Mitchell's map, by which the framers of the treaty\r\nof 1783 are acknowledged to have regulated their joint and official\r\nproceedings, and the Map A, which has been agreed on by the contracting\r\nparties as a delineation of the water courses, and of the boundary lines\r\nin reference to the said water courses, as contended for by each party,\r\nrespectively, and which has accordingly been signed by the above-named\r\nplenipotentiaries at the same time with this convention, shall be\r\nannexed to the statements of the contracting parties and be the only\r\nmaps that shall be considered as evidence mutually acknowledged by the\r\ncontracting parties of the topography of the country.\r\n\r\nIt shall, however, be lawful for either party to annex to its respective\r\nfirst statement, for the purposes of general illustration, any of the\r\nmaps, surveys, or topographical delineations which were filed with\r\nthe commissioners under the fifth article of the treaty of Ghent,\r\nany engraved map heretofore published, and also a transcript of the\r\nabove-mentioned Map A or of a section thereof, in which transcript each\r\nparty may lay down the highlands or other features of the country as it\r\nshall think fit, the water courses and the boundary lines as claimed\r\nby each party remaining as laid down in the said Map A. But this\r\ntranscript, as well as all the other maps, surveys, or topographical\r\ndelineations, other than the Map A and Mitchell's map, intended to be\r\nthus annexed by either party to the respective statements, shall be\r\ncommunicated to the other party, in the same manner as aforesaid, within\r\nnine months after the exchange of the ratifications of this convention,\r\nand shall be subject to such objections and observations as the other\r\ncontracting party may deem it expedient to make thereto, and shall annex\r\nto his first statement, either in the margin of such transcript, map or\r\nmaps, or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note X_.\r\n\r\n[Extract from the award of the King of the Netherlands.]\r\n\r\nConsidering that, according to the instances alleged, the term highlands\r\napplies not only to a hilly or elevated country, but also to land which,\r\nwithout being hilly, divides waters flowing in different directions, and\r\nthat thus the character, more or less hilly and elevated, of the country\r\nthrough which are drawn the two lines respectively claimed at the north\r\nand at the south of the river St. John can not form the basis of a\r\nchoice between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note XI_.\r\n\r\nThe reason of the double delineation of the Restigouche on the map of\r\nMitchell and several others of ancient date is obvious. A mistake was\r\ncommon to them all by which the Bay of Chaleurs was laid down too\r\nfar to the north. The main branch, or Grande Fourche, of Restigouche\r\n(Katawamkedgwick) has been reached by parties setting out from the banks\r\nof the St. Lawrence at Metis, and was known to fall into the Bay of\r\nChaleurs, while the united stream had also been visited by persons\r\ncrossing the wagansis of Grand River and descending the Southwestern\r\nBranch. The map makers could not, in consequence of the error in\r\nlatitude, make their plat meet, and therefore considered the part of\r\nthe united streams reached in the two different directions as different\r\nbodies of water, and without authority sought an outlet for that which\r\nthey laid down as the southernmost of the two in another bay of the Gulf\r\nof St. Lawrence. On many of the maps, however, the small stream which\r\nmodern geographers improperly call Restigouche is readily\r\ndistinguishable under the name of Chacodi.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note XII_.\r\n\r\nIn the argument of the British commissioners under Jay's treaty the\r\nfollowing points were maintained, and, being sanctioned by the decision\r\nof the umpire, became the grounds of an award acceded to by both\r\nGovernments:\r\n\r\nFirst. That the limits of Nova Scotia had been altered from the southern\r\nbank of the St. Lawrence to the highlands described in the treaty of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nSecond. That if the river Schoodiac were the true St. Croix the\r\nnorthwest angle of Nova Scotia could be formed by the western and\r\nnorthern boundaries (the meridian line and the highlands).\r\n\r\nThird. That the territory of Acadie, or Nova Scotia, was, the same\r\nterritory granted to Sir William Alexander.\r\n\r\nFourth. That the sea and Atlantic Ocean were used as convertible terms.\r\n\r\nFifth. That from the date of the treaty of Utrecht the boundary between\r\nMassachusetts and Nova Scotia was that of the patent to Sir William\r\nAlexander.\r\n\r\nSixth. That the Provinces of Quebec and Nova Scotia belonged to and were\r\nin possession of His Britannic Majesty in 1783, and that he had an\r\nundoubted right to cede to the United States such part of them as he\r\nmight think fit.\r\n\r\nSeventh. That the due north line from the source of the St. Croix must\r\nof necessity cross the St. John.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has since been maintained on the part of Great Britain:\r\n\r\nFirst. That the limits of Nova Scotia never did extend to the St.\r\nLawrence.\r\n\r\nSecond. That the northwest angle of Nova Scotia was unknown in 1783.\r\n\r\nThird. That Acadie extended south to the forty-sixth degree of north\r\nlatitude, and was not the same with Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\nFourth. That the sea and the Atlantic Ocean were different things.\r\n\r\nFifth. That the claims and rights of Massachusetts did not extend to the\r\nwestern bounds of the grant to Sir William Alexander.\r\n\r\nSixth. That this being the case the cession of territory not included\r\nwithin her limits is void.\r\n\r\nSeventh. That it could never have been intended that the meridian line\r\nshould cross the St. John.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note XIII_.\r\n\r\nIt has been pretended that the grant of the fief of Madawaska in 1683\r\ncan be urged as a bar to the claim of Massachusetts. That fief, indeed,\r\nwas among the early grants of the French governors of Canada, but it is\r\nnot included in the claim which the French themselves set up. It was\r\ntherefore covered by the Massachusetts charter, because the grant had\r\nnever been acted upon. Even up to the present day this fief can hardly\r\nbe said to be settled or occupied except by the retainers of the\r\ngarrison of Fort Ingall, and from all the evidence which could be found\r\non the spot it appeared that no settlement had ever been made upon it\r\nuntil the establishment of a posthouse some time between the date of the\r\ntreaties of 1783 and 1794. It therefore was not at the time the charter\r\nof Massachusetts was granted (1691) \"actually possessed or inhabited by\r\nany other Christian prince or state.\"\r\n\r\nAn argument has also been attempted to be drawn from the limits given on\r\nGreenleaf's map to a purchase made from the State of Massachusetts by\r\nWatkins and Flint. This purchase is, however, by the patent extended to\r\nthe highlands, and the surveyors who laid it out crossed the Walloostook\r\nin search of them. Here they met, at a short distance from that stream,\r\nwith waters running to the north, which they conceived to be waters of\r\nthe St. Lawrence, and they terminated their survey. The lines traced on\r\nGreenleaf's map are therefore incorrect, either as compared with the\r\ngrant or the actual survey, and although from a want of knowledge of the\r\ncountry the surveyors stopped at waters running into Lake Temiscouata\r\ninstead of the St. Lawrence, the very error shows the understanding they\r\nhad of the true design of the patent, and this transaction, so far from\r\nbeing an available argument against the American claim, is an act of\r\npossession at an early date within the limits of the disputed territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 8, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with your resolution of the 31st March, 1842, I have the\r\nhonor to submit the accompanying document and report[64] from the\r\nCommissioner of the General Land Office.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: Relating to surveys and sales of the public lands during\r\n1841 and 1842, etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 9, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the House of Representatives a report from the\r\nSecretary of State, with a copy of the correspondence[65] requested by\r\ntheir resolution of the 7th instant.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: With Great Britain relative to an international copyright\r\nlaw.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 11, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit a memorial[66] which I have received from the\r\nChoctaw tribe of Indians and citizens of the State of Mississippi, with\r\na request that I should communicate the same to Congress.

1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with your resolution of the 29th instant, I have the honor\r\nto transmit the reports of Messrs. Kelley and Steuart, two of the\r\ncommissioners originally appointed, along with Mr. Poindexter, to\r\ninvestigate the affairs of the custom-house of New York, together with\r\nall the correspondence and testimony accompanying the same, and also the\r\nreport of Mr. Poindexter, to which is annexed two letters, subscribed by\r\nMr. Poindexter and Mr. Bradley. The last-named gentleman was substituted\r\nin the place of Mr. Kelley, whose inclinations and duties called him to\r\nhis residence in Ohio after the return of the commissioners to this\r\ncity, about the last of August. One of the letters just mentioned was\r\naddressed to the Secretary of the Treasury and bears date the 12th of\r\nApril instant, and the other to myself, dated the 20th of this month.\r\nFrom the former you will learn that a most interesting portion of\r\nthe inquiry instituted by this Department (viz, that relating to\r\nlight-houses, buoys, beacons, revenue cutters, and revenue boats) is\r\nproposed to be made the subject of a further report by Messrs. Bradley\r\nand Poindexter. You will also learn, through the accompanying letter\r\nfrom Mr. Steuart, the reasons which have delayed him in making a\r\nsupplemental and additional report to that already made by himself and\r\nMr. Kelley, embracing his views and opinions upon the developments made\r\nsubsequent to the withdrawal of Mr. Kelley from the commission and the\r\nsubstitution of Mr. Bradley in his place. I also transmit two documents\r\nfurnished by Mr. Steuart, and which were handed by him to the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury on the 7th instant, the one being \"memoranda of\r\nproceedings,\" etc., marked No. 1, and the other \"letters accompanying\r\nmemoranda,\" etc., marked No. 2.\r\n\r\nThe commission was instituted for the purpose of ascertaining existing\r\ndefects in the custom-house regulations, to trace to their true causes\r\npast errors, to detect abuses, and by wholesome reforms to guard\r\nin future not only against fraud and peculation, but error and\r\nmismanagement. For these purposes a selection was made of persons of\r\nacknowledged intelligence and industry, and upon this task they have\r\nbeen engaged for almost an entire year, and their labors remain yet to\r\nbe completed. The character of those labors may be estimated by the\r\nextent of Messrs. Kelley and Steuart's report, embracing about 100\r\npages of closely written manuscript, the voluminous memoranda and\r\ncorrespondence of Mr. Steuart, the great mass of evidence accompanying\r\nMessrs. Kelley and Steuart's report, and the report of Mr. Poindexter,\r\nextending over 394 pages, comprised in the volume accompanying this,\r\nand additional reports still remaining to be made, as before stated.\r\n\r\nI should be better pleased to have it in my power to communicate the\r\nentire mass of reports made and contemplated to be made at one and the\r\nsame time, and still more should I have been gratified if time could\r\nhave been allowed me, consistently with the apparent desire of the House\r\nof Representatives to be put into immediate possession of these papers,\r\nto have compared or even to have read with deliberation the views\r\npresented by the commissioners as to proposed reforms in the revenue\r\nlaws, together with the mass of documentary evidence and information by\r\nwhich they have been explained and enforced and which do not admit of a\r\nsatisfactory comparison until the whole circle of reports be completed.\r\nCharges of malfeasance against some of those now in office will devolve\r\nupon the Executive a rigid investigation into their extent and\r\ncharacter, and will in due season claim my attention. The readiness,\r\nhowever, with which the House proposes to enter upon the grave and\r\ndifficult subjects which these papers suggest having anticipated that\r\nconsideration of them by the Executive which their importance demands,\r\nit only remains for me, in lieu of specific recommendations, which under\r\nother circumstances it would have been my duty to make, to urge upon\r\nCongress the importance and necessity of introducing the earliest\r\nreforms in existing laws and usages, so as to guard the country in\r\nfuture against frauds in the collection of the revenues and the Treasury\r\nagainst peculation, to relieve trade and commerce from oppressive\r\nregulations, and to guard law and morality against violation and abuse.\r\n\r\nAs from their great volume it has been necessary to transmit the\r\noriginal papers to the House, I have to suggest the propriety of the\r\nHouse taking order for their restoration to the Treasury Department\r\nat such time as may comport with its pleasure.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 2, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have this day received and now transmit to the House of\r\nRepresentatives the accompanying communication from Benjamin F. Butler,\r\nhaving relation to the reports of the commissioners appointed by me to\r\nexamine into the affairs connected with the New York custom-house. As\r\nthe whole subject is in possession of the House, I deem it also proper\r\nto communicate Mr. Butler's letter.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 10, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe season for active hostilities in Florida having nearly terminated,\r\nmy attention has necessarily been directed to the course of measures to\r\nbe pursued hereafter in relation to the few Indians yet remaining in\r\nthat Territory. Their number is believed not to exceed 240, of whom\r\nthere are supposed to be about 80 warriors, or males capable of bearing\r\narms. The further pursuit of these miserable beings by a large military\r\nforce seems to be as injudicious as it is unavailing. The history\r\nof the last year's campaign in Florida has satisfactorily shown that\r\nnotwithstanding the vigorous and incessant operations of our troops\r\n(which can not be exceeded), the Indian mode of warfare, their dispersed\r\ncondition, and the very smallness of their number (which increases the\r\ndifficulty of finding them in the abundant and almost inaccessible\r\nhiding places of the Territory) render any further attempt to secure\r\nthem by force impracticable except by the employment of the most\r\nexpensive means. The exhibition of force and the constant efforts\r\nto capture or destroy them of course places them beyond the reach of\r\novertures to surrender. It is believed by the distinguished officer in\r\ncommand there that a different system should now be pursued to attain\r\nthe entire removal of all the Indians in Florida, and he recommends\r\nthat hostilities should cease unless the renewal of them be rendered\r\nnecessary by new aggressions; that communications should be opened by\r\nmeans of the Indians with him to insure them a peaceful and voluntary\r\nsurrender, and that the military operations should hereafter be directed\r\nto the protection of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThese views are strengthened and corroborated by the governor of the\r\nTerritory, by many of its most intelligent citizens, and by numerous\r\nofficers of the Army who have served and are still serving in that\r\nregion. Mature reflection has satisfied me that these recommendations\r\nare sound and just; and I rejoice that consistently with duty to Florida\r\nI may indulge my desire to promote the great interests of humanity and\r\nextend the reign of peace and good will by terminating the unhappy\r\nwarfare that has so long been carried on there, and at the same time\r\ngratify my anxiety to reduce the demands upon the Treasury by curtailing\r\nthe extraordinary expenses which have attended the contest. I have\r\ntherefore authorized the colonel in command there as soon as he shall\r\ndeem it expedient to declare that hostilities against the Indians have\r\nceased, and that they will not be renewed unless provoked and rendered\r\nindispensable by new outrages on their part, but that neither citizens\r\nnor troops are to be restrained from any necessary and proper acts of\r\nself-defense against any attempts to molest them. He is instructed to\r\nopen communications with those yet remaining, and endeavor by all\r\npeaceable means to persuade them to consult their true interests by\r\njoining their brethren at the West; and directions have been given for\r\nestablishing a cordon or line of protection for the inhabitants by the\r\nnecessary number of troops.\r\n\r\nBut to render this system of protection effectual it is essential\r\nthat settlements of our citizens should be made within the line so\r\nestablished, and that they should be armed, so as to be ready to repel\r\nany attack. In order to afford inducements to such settlements, I submit\r\nto the consideration of Congress the propriety of allowing a reasonable\r\nquantity of land to the head of each family that shall permanently\r\noccupy it, and of extending the existing provisions on that subject so\r\nas to permit the issue of rations for the subsistence of the settlers\r\nfor one year; and as few of them will probably be provided with arms, it\r\nwould be expedient to authorize the loan of muskets and the delivery of\r\na proper quantity of cartridges or of powder and balls. By such means it\r\nis to be hoped that a hardy population will soon occupy the rich soil of\r\nthe frontiers of Florida, who will be as capable as willing to defend\r\nthemselves and their houses, and thus relieve the Government from\r\nfurther anxiety or expense for their protection.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 13, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report[71] from the Postmaster-General, made in\r\npursuance of the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 21st\r\nof March last, together with the accompanying documents.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: Transmitting lists of postmasters and others appointed by\r\nthe President and Post-Office Department from April 4, 1841, to March\r\n21, 1842.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 16, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nHaving directed hostilities in Florida to cease, the time seems to have\r\narrived for distinguishing with appropriate honors the brave army that\r\nhave so long encountered the perils of savage warfare in a country\r\npresenting every imaginable difficulty and in seasons and under a\r\nclimate fruitful of disease. The history of the hardships which our\r\nsoldiers have endured, of the patience and perseverance which have\r\nenabled them to triumph over obstacles altogether unexampled, and of the\r\ngallantry which they have exhibited on every occasion which a subtle\r\nand skulking foe would allow them to improve is so familiar as not to\r\nrequire repetition at my hands. But justice to the officers and men now\r\nin Florida demands that their privations, sufferings, and dauntless\r\nexertions during a summer's campaign in such a climate, which for the\r\nfirst time was witnessed during the last year, should be specially\r\ncommended. The foe has not been allowed opportunity either to plant or\r\nto cultivate or to reap. The season, which to him has usually been one\r\nof repose and preparation for renewed conflict, has been vigorously\r\noccupied by incessant and harassing pursuit, by penetrating his hiding\r\nplaces and laying waste his rude dwellings, and by driving him from\r\nswamp to swamp and from everglade to everglade. True, disease and death\r\nhave been encountered at the same time and in the same pursuit, but\r\nthey have been disregarded by a brave and gallant army, determined on\r\nfulfilling to the uttermost the duties assigned them, however inglorious\r\nthey might esteem the particular service in which they were engaged.\r\n\r\nTo all who have been thus engaged the executive department, responding\r\nto the universal sentiment of the country, has already awarded the meed\r\nof approbation. There must, however, in all such cases be some who,\r\navailing themselves of the occasions which fortune afforded, have\r\ndistinguished themselves for \"gallant actions and meritorious conduct\"\r\nbeyond the usual high gallantry and great merit which an intelligent\r\npublic opinion concedes to the whole Army. To express to these the sense\r\nwhich their Government cherishes of their public conduct and to hold up\r\nto their fellow-citizens the bright example of their courage, constancy,\r\nand patriotic devotion would seem to be but the performance of the very\r\nduty contemplated by that provision of our laws which authorizes the\r\nissuing of brevet commissions.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the country, a long peace, interrupted only by\r\ndifficulties with Indians at particular points, has afforded few\r\noccasions for the exercise of this power, and it may be regarded as\r\nfavorable to the encouragement of a proper military spirit throughout\r\nthe Army that an opportunity is now given to evince the readiness of the\r\nGovernment to reward unusual merit with a peculiar and lasting\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nI therefore nominate to the Senate the persons whose names are contained\r\nin the accompanying list[72] for brevet commissions for services in\r\nFlorida. That the number is large is evidence only of the value of the\r\nservices rendered during a contest that has continued nearly as long as\r\nthe War of the Revolution. The difficulty has been to reduce the number\r\nas much as possible without injustice to any, and to accomplish this\r\ngreat and mature consideration has been bestowed on the case of every\r\nofficer who has served in Florida.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: Omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 24, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate a treaty recently concluded with the\r\nWyandott tribe of Indians, and request the advice and consent of the\r\nSenate to the ratification of the same as proposed to be modified by the\r\nWar Department.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 1, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit a report from the Acting Commissioner of the General\r\nLand Office and the documents accompanying the same (from No. 1 to No.\r\n7), in relation to the conduct of N.P.

compensation of employees and\r\nwitnesses in connection with the commission of inquiry relative to\r\nthe public buildings in Washington, D.C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 25, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have this day approved and signed an act, which originated in the\r\nHouse of Representatives, entitled \"An act for an apportionment of\r\nRepresentatives among the several States according to the Sixth Census,\"\r\nand have caused the same to be deposited in the office of the Secretary\r\nof State, accompanied by an exposition of my reasons for giving to it my\r\nsanction.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Transmitted to the House of Representatives by the Secretary of State\r\nin compliance with a resolution of that body.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 25,1842_.\r\n\r\nA BILL entitled \"An act for an apportionment of Representatives among\r\nthe several States according to the Sixth Census,\" approved June 25, 1842.\r\n\r\nIn approving this bill I feel it due to myself to say, as well that my\r\nmotives for signing it may be rightly understood as that my opinions may\r\nnot be liable to be misconstrued or quoted hereafter erroneously as a\r\nprecedent, that I have not proceeded so much upon a _clear and decided\r\nopinion of my own_ respecting the constitutionality or policy of the\r\nentire act as from respect to the declared will of the two Houses of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nIn yielding _my doubts_ to the matured opinion of Congress I have\r\nfollowed the advice of the first Secretary of State to the first\r\nPresident of the United States and the example set by that illustrious\r\ncitizen upon a memorable occasion.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a member of either House of Congress I acted under the\r\nconviction that _to doubt_ as to the constitutionality of a law was\r\nsufficient to induce me to give my vote against it; but I have not been\r\nable to bring myself to believe that _a doubtful opinion_ of the Chief\r\nMagistrate ought to outweigh the solemnly pronounced opinion of the\r\nrepresentatives of the people and of the States.\r\n\r\nOne of the prominent features of the bill is that which purports\r\nto be mandatory on the States to form districts for the choice of\r\nRepresentatives to Congress, in single districts. That Congress itself\r\nhas power by law to alter State regulations respecting the manner of\r\nholding elections for Representatives is clear, but its power to command\r\nthe States to make new regulations or alter their existing regulations\r\nis the question upon which I have felt deep and strong doubts. I have\r\nyielded those doubts, however, to the opinion of the Legislature, giving\r\neffect to their enactment as far as depends on my approbation, and\r\nleaving questions which may arise hereafter, if unhappily such should\r\narise, to be settled by full consideration of the several provisions of\r\nthe Constitution and the laws and the authority of each House to judge\r\nof the elections, returns, and qualifications of its own members.\r\n\r\nSimilar considerations have operated with me in regard to the\r\nrepresentation of fractions above a moiety of the representative number,\r\nand where such moiety exceeds 30,000--a question on which a diversity of\r\nopinion has existed from the foundation of the Government. The provision\r\nrecommends itself from its nearer approximation to equality than would\r\nbe found in the application of a common and simple divisor to the\r\nentire population of each State, and corrects in a great degree those\r\ninequalities which are destined at the recurrence of each succeeding\r\ncensus so greatly to augment.\r\n\r\nIn approving the bill I flatter myself that a disposition will be\r\nperceived on my part to concede to the opinions of Congress in a matter\r\nwhich may conduce to the good of the country and the stability of its\r\ninstitutions, upon which my own opinion is not clear and decided.\r\nBut it seemed to me due to the respectability of opinion against the\r\nconstitutionality of the bill, as well as to the real difficulties\r\nof the subject, which no one feels more sensibly than I do, that the\r\nreasons which have determined me should be left on record.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 1, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the suggestions contained in the accompanying letter\r\nfrom the Secretary of the Navy and of my own convictions of their\r\npropriety, I transmit to the Senate the report made by Lieutenant\r\nWilkes, commander of the exploring expedition, relative to the Oregon\r\nTerritory. Having due regard to the negotiations now pending between\r\nthis Government and the Government of Great Britain through its special\r\nenvoy, I have thought it proper to communicate the report confidentially\r\nto the Senate.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 2, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI submit to Congress the printed copy of certain resolutions of the\r\nlegislature of the State of Louisiana, accompanied by a letter from the\r\nSenators and Representatives from that State, and also a letter from the\r\nSolicitor of the Treasury and Commissioner of the General Land Office,\r\nrequesting and recommending that a suit in ejectment may be authorized\r\nand directed in order to test the validity of a grant made on the 20th\r\nof June, 1797, by the Baron de Carondelet, Governor-General of\r\nLouisiana, to the Marquis de Maison Rouge.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of this claim renders it highly desirable that a speedy\r\ntermination should be put to all contest concerning it, and I therefore\r\nrecommend that Congress shall authorize such proceedings as may be best\r\ncalculated to bring it to a close.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 9, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 21st ultimo, requesting information relative to proceedings of this\r\nGovernment in the case of George Johnson, a citizen of the United States\r\naggrieved by acts of authorities of the Republic of Uruguay, I transmit\r\na report from the Secretary of State with the accompanying Papers.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 14, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 12th\r\ninstant, requesting copies of papers upon the subject of the relations\r\nbetween the United States and the Mexican Republic, I transmit a report\r\nfrom the Secretary of State and the documents by which it was\r\naccompanied.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 14, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 11th instant,\r\ncalling for the recent correspondence between the Republic of Mexico and\r\nthis Government in relation to Texas, I transmit a report from the\r\nSecretary of State, with the accompanying documents.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 20, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn further compliance with the resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the 29th of April last, I transmit herewith a\r\nsupplemental and additional report of William M. Steuart, one of the\r\ncommissioners appointed to investigate the affairs of the New York\r\ncustom-house, which has recently been received, and which, like the\r\nreports of the commissioners heretofore communicated to the House, I\r\nhave not had an opportunity to examine. For the reason stated in my\r\nmessage to the House of the 30th of April last, I shall abstain, as I\r\nhave done hitherto, from recommending any specific measures which might\r\nbe suggested by an examination of the various reports on the subject.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 22, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n13th instant, upon the subject of the relations between the United\r\nStates and the Republic of Texas, I transmit a report from the Secretary\r\nof State. My last communication to Congress relating to that Republic\r\nwas my message of the 30th of March last, suggesting the expediency\r\nof legislative provisions for improving the trade and facilitating\r\nthe intercourse by post between the United States and Texas. The\r\nreport of the Secretary of State is accompanied by a copy of all the\r\ncorrespondence between the two Governments since that period which it\r\nwould be compatible with the public interest to communicate to the\r\nHouse of Representatives at this time.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 8, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn the communication made to the Senate on the 13th of June, in answer\r\nto its resolution of the 2d of March last, there appears to have been,\r\namong other papers, sundry letters addressed to the Department of State\r\nby certain claimants or their agents containing reflections upon the\r\ncharacter of the umpire appointed by His Prussian Majesty pursuant to\r\nthe convention between the United States and the Mexican Republic of the\r\n11th of April, 1839. As the call was for all communications which had\r\nbeen addressed to the Department of State by any of the claimants under\r\nthat convention relative to the proceedings and progress of the mixed\r\ncommission, the copies were prepared and submitted without attracting\r\nthe attention either of the head of the Department or myself. If those\r\nletters had been noticed, their transmission to the Senate, if\r\ntransmitted at all, would have been accompanied by a disclaimer on the\r\npart of the Executive of any intention to approve such charges. The\r\nExecutive has no complaint to make against the conduct or decisions of\r\nthe highly respectable person appointed by his sovereign umpire between\r\nthe American and Mexican commissioners.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 10, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with your resolution of the 18th July, I herewith transmit\r\na letter from the Acting Secretary of the Treasury and a report from the\r\nCommissioner of Public Buildings, together with the accompanying\r\ndocuments.[78]\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: Relating to the macadamizing of Pennsylvania Avenue,\r\nWashington D.C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 11, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction to communicate to the Senate the results of\r\nthe negotiations recently had in this city with the British minister,\r\nspecial and extraordinary.\r\n\r\nThese results comprise--\r\n\r\nFirst. A treaty to settle and define the boundaries between the\r\nterritories of the United States and the possessions of Her Britannic\r\nMajesty in North America, for the suppression of the African slave\r\ntrade, and the surrender of criminals fugitive from justice in certain\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nSecond. A correspondence on the subject of the interference of the\r\ncolonial authorities of the British West Indies with American merchant\r\nvessels driven by stress of weather or carried by violence into the\r\nports of those colonies.\r\n\r\nThird. A correspondence upon the subject of the attack and destruction\r\nof the steamboat _Caroline_.\r\n\r\nFourth. A correspondence on the subject of impressment.\r\n\r\nIf this treaty shall receive the approbation of the Senate, it will\r\nterminate a difference respecting boundary which has long subsisted\r\nbetween the two Governments, has been the subject of several ineffectual\r\nattempts at settlement, and has sometimes led to great irritation, not\r\nwithout danger of disturbing the existing peace. Both the United States\r\nand the States more immediately concerned have entertained no doubt of\r\nthe validity of the American title to all the territory which has been\r\nin dispute, but that title was controverted and the Government of the\r\nUnited States had agreed to make the dispute a subject of arbitration.\r\nOne arbitration had been actually had, but had failed to settle the\r\ncontroversy, and it was found at the commencement of last year that a\r\ncorrespondence had been in progress between the two Governments for a\r\njoint commission, with an ultimate reference to an umpire or arbitrator\r\nwith authority to make a final decision. That correspondence, however,\r\nhad been retarded by various occurrences, and had come to no definite\r\nresult when the special mission of Lord Ashburton was announced. This\r\nmovement on the part of England afforded in the judgment of the\r\nExecutive a favorable opportunity for making an attempt to settle this\r\nlong-existing controversy by some agreement or treaty without further\r\nreference to arbitration.\r\n\r\nIt seemed entirely proper that if this purpose were entertained\r\nconsultation should be had with the authorities of the States of\r\nMaine and Massachusetts. Letters, therefore, of which copies are\r\nherewith communicated, were addressed to the governors of those States,\r\nsuggesting that commissioners should be appointed by each of them,\r\nrespectively, to repair to this city and confer with the authorities\r\nof this Government on a line by agreement or compromise, with its\r\nequivalents and compensations. This suggestion was met by both States\r\nin a spirit of candor and patriotism and promptly complied with.\r\nFour commissioners on the part of Maine and three on the part of\r\nMassachusetts, all persons of distinction and high character, were duly\r\nappointed and commissioned and lost no time in presenting themselves at\r\nthe seat of the Government of the United States. These commissioners\r\nhave been in correspondence with this Government during the period of\r\nthe discussions; have enjoyed its confidence and freest communications;\r\nhave aided the general object with their counsel and advice, and in the\r\nend have unanimously signified their assent to the line proposed in the\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily it would be no easy task to reconcile and bring together such\r\na variety of interests in a matter in itself difficult and perplexed,\r\nbut the efforts of the Government in attempting to accomplish this\r\ndesirable object have been seconded and sustained by a spirit of\r\naccommodation and conciliation on the part of the States concerned,\r\nto which much of the success of these efforts is to be ascribed.\r\n\r\nConnected with the settlement of the line of the northeastern boundary,\r\nso far as it respects the States of Maine and Massachusetts, is the\r\ncontinuation of that line along the highlands to the northwesternmost\r\nhead of Connecticut River. Which of the sources of that stream is\r\nentitled to this character has been matter of controversy and of some\r\ninterest to the State of New Hampshire. The King of the Netherlands\r\ndecided the main branch to be the northwesternmost head of the\r\nConnecticut. This did not satisfy the claim of New Hampshire. The line\r\nagreed to in the present treaty follows the highlands to the head of\r\nHalls Stream and thence down that river, embracing the whole claim of\r\nNew Hampshire and establishing her title to 100,000 acres of territory\r\nmore than she would have had by the decision of the King of the\r\nNetherlands.\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of 1783 the line is to proceed down the Connecticut\r\nRiver to the forty-fifth degree of north latitude, and thence west by\r\nthat parallel till it strikes the St. Lawrence. Recent examinations\r\nhaving ascertained that the line heretofore received as the true line of\r\nlatitude between those points was erroneous, and that the correction of\r\nthis error would not only leave on the British side a considerable tract\r\nof territory heretofore supposed to belong to the States of Vermont and\r\nNew York, but also Rouses Point, the site of a military work of the\r\nUnited States, it has been regarded as an object of importance not only\r\nto establish the rights and jurisdiction of those States up to the line\r\nto which they have been considered to extend, but also to comprehend\r\nRouses Point within the territory of the United States. The\r\nrelinquishment by the British Government of all the territory south of\r\nthe line heretofore considered to be the true line has been obtained,\r\nand the consideration for this relinquishment is to inure by the\r\nprovisions of the treaty to the States of Maine and Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe line of boundary, then, from the source of the St. Croix to the St.\r\nLawrence, so far as Maine and Massachusetts are concerned, is fixed by\r\ntheir own consent and for considerations satisfactory to them, the chief\r\nof these considerations being the privilege of transporting the lumber\r\nand agricultural products grown and raised in Maine on the waters of the\r\nSt. Johns and its tributaries down that river to the ocean free from\r\nimposition or disability. The importance of this privilege, perpetual\r\nin its terms, to a country covered at present by pine forests of great\r\nvalue, and much of it capable hereafter of agricultural improvement, is\r\nnot a matter upon which the opinion of intelligent men is likely to be\r\ndivided.\r\n\r\nSo far as New Hampshire is concerned, the treaty secures all that she\r\nrequires, and New York and Vermont are quieted to the extent of their\r\nclaim and occupation. The difference which would be made in the northern\r\nboundary of these two States by correcting the parallel of latitude may\r\nbe seen on Tanner's maps (1836), new atlas, maps Nos. 6 and 9.\r\n\r\nFrom the intersection of the forty-fifth degree of north latitude\r\nwith the St. Lawrence and along that river and the lakes to the water\r\ncommunication between Lake Huron and Lake Superior the line was\r\ndefinitively agreed on by the commissioners of the two Governments\r\nunder the sixth article of the treaty of Ghent; but between this\r\nlast-mentioned point and the Lake of the Woods the commissioners acting\r\nunder the seventh article of that treaty found several matters of\r\ndisagreement, and therefore made no joint report to their respective\r\nGovernments. The first of these was Sugar Island, or St. Georges Island,\r\nlying in St. Marys River, or the water communication between Lakes Huron\r\nand Superior. By the present treaty this island is embraced in the\r\nterritories of the United States. Both from soil and position it is\r\nregarded as of much value.\r\n\r\nAnother matter of difference was the manner of extending the line from\r\nthe point at which the commissioners arrived, north of Isle Royale,\r\nin Lake Superior, to the Lake of the Woods. The British commissioner\r\ninsisted on proceeding to Fond du Lac, at the southwest angle of the\r\nlake, and thence by the river St. Louis to the Rainy Lake. The American\r\ncommissioner supposed the true course to be to proceed by way of the Dog\r\nRiver. Attempts were made to compromise this difference, but without\r\nsuccess. The details of these proceedings are found at length in the\r\nprinted separate reports of the commissioners.\r\n\r\nFrom the imperfect knowledge of this remote country at the date of\r\nthe treaty of peace, some of the descriptions in that treaty do not\r\nharmonize with its natural features as now ascertained. \"Long Lake\" is\r\nnowhere to be found under that name. There is reason for supposing,\r\nhowever, that the sheet of water intended by that name is the estuary\r\nat the mouth of Pigeon River. The present treaty therefore adopts that\r\nestuary and river, and afterwards pursues the usual route across the\r\nheight of land by the various portages and small lakes till the line\r\nreaches Rainy Lake, from which the commissioners agreed on the extension\r\nof it to its termination in the northwest angle of the Lake of the\r\nWoods. The region of country on and near the shore of the lake between\r\nPigeon River on the north and Fond du Lac and the river St. Louis on\r\nthe south and west, considered valuable as a mineral region, is thus\r\nincluded within the United States. It embraces a territory of 4,000,000\r\nacres northward of the claim set up by the British commissioner under\r\nthe treaty of Ghent. From the height of land at the head of Pigeon River\r\nwesterly to the Rainy Lake the country is understood to be of little\r\nvalue, being described by surveyors and marked on the map as a region\r\nof rock and water.\r\n\r\nFrom the northwest angle of the Lake of the Woods, which is found to be\r\nin latitude 45° 23' 55\" north, existing treaties require the line to be\r\nrun due south to its intersection with the forty-fifth parallel, and\r\nthence along that parallel to the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nAfter sundry informal communications with the British minister upon the\r\nsubject of the claims of the two countries to territory west of the\r\nRocky Mountains, so little probability was found to exist of coming\r\nto any agreement on that subject at present that it was not thought\r\nexpedient to make it one of the subjects of formal negotiation to be\r\nentered upon between this Government and the British minister as part\r\nof his duties under his special mission.\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of 1783 the line of division along the rivers and lakes\r\nfrom the place where the forty-fifth parallel of north latitude strikes\r\nthe St. Lawrence to the outlet of Lake Superior is invariably to be\r\ndrawn through the middle of such waters, and not through the middle of\r\ntheir main channels. Such a line, if extended according to the literal\r\nterms of the treaty, would, it is obvious, occasionally intersect\r\nislands. The manner in which the commissioners of the two Governments\r\ndealt with this difficult subject may be seen in their reports. But\r\nwhere the line thus following the middle of the river or water course\r\ndid not meet with islands, yet it was liable sometimes to leave the only\r\npracticable navigable channel altogether on one side. The treaty made no\r\nprovision for the common use of the waters by the citizens and subjects\r\nof both countries.\r\n\r\nIt has happened, therefore, in a few instances that the use of the river\r\nin particular places would be greatly diminished to one party or the\r\nother if in fact there was not a choice in the use of channels and\r\npassages. Thus at the Long Sault, in the St. Lawrence--a dangerous\r\npassage, practicable only for boats--the only safe run is between the\r\nLong Sault Islands and Barnharts Island (all which belong to the United\r\nStates) on one side and the American shore on the other. On the other\r\nhand, by far the best passage for vessels of any depth of water from\r\nLake Erie into the Detroit River is between Bois Blanc, a British\r\nisland, and the Canadian shore. So again, there are several channels or\r\npassages, of different degrees of facility and usefulness, between the\r\nseveral islands in the river St. Clair at or near its entry into the\r\nlake of that name. In these three cases the treaty provides that all the\r\nseveral passages and channels shall be free and open to the use of the\r\ncitizens and subjects of both parties.\r\n\r\nThe treaty obligations subsisting between the two countries for the\r\nsuppression of the African slave trade and the complaints made to this\r\nGovernment within the last three or four years, many of them but too\r\nwell founded, of the visitation, seizure, and detention of American\r\nvessels on that coast by British cruisers could not but form a delicate\r\nand highly important part of the negotiations which have now been held.\r\n\r\nThe early and prominent part which the Government of the United States\r\nhas taken for the abolition of this unlawful and inhuman traffic is well\r\nknown. By the tenth article of the treaty of Ghent it is declared that\r\nthe traffic in slaves is irreconcilable with the principles of humanity\r\nand justice, and that both His Majesty and the United States are\r\ndesirous of continuing their efforts to promote its entire abolition;\r\nand it is thereby agreed that both the contracting parties shall use\r\ntheir best endeavors to accomplish so desirable an object. The\r\nGovernment of the United States has by law declared the African slave\r\ntrade piracy, and at its suggestion other nations have made similar\r\nenactments. It has not been wanting in honest and zealous efforts, made\r\nin conformity with the wishes of the whole country, to accomplish the\r\nentire abolition of the traffic in slaves upon the African coast, but\r\nthese efforts and those of other countries directed to the same end have\r\nproved to a considerable degree unsuccessful. Treaties are known to have\r\nbeen entered into some years ago between England and France by which the\r\nformer power, which usually maintains a large naval force on the African\r\nstation, was authorized to seize and bring in for adjudication vessels\r\nfound engaged in the slave trade under the French flag.\r\n\r\nIt is known that in December last a treaty was signed in London by the\r\nrepresentatives of England, France, Russia, Prussia, and Austria having\r\nfor its professed object a strong and united effort of the five\r\npowers to put an end to the traffic. This treaty was not officially\r\ncommunicated to the Government of the United States, but its provisions\r\nand stipulations are supposed to be accurately known to the public.\r\nIt is understood to be not yet ratified on the part of France.\r\n\r\nNo application or request has been made to this Government to become\r\nparty to this treaty, but the course it might take in regard to it has\r\nexcited no small degree of attention and discussion in Europe, as the\r\nprinciple upon which it is founded and the stipulations which it\r\ncontains have caused warm animadversions and great political excitement.\r\n\r\nIn my message at the commencement of the present session of Congress\r\nI endeavored to state the principles which this Government supports\r\nrespecting the right of search and the immunity of flags. Desirous of\r\nmaintaining those principles fully, at the same time that existing\r\nobligations should be fulfilled, I have thought it most consistent with\r\nthe honor and dignity of the country that it should execute its own laws\r\nand perform its own obligations by its own means and its own power.\r\n\r\nThe examination or visitation of the merchant vessels of one nation\r\nby the cruisers of another for any purpose except those known and\r\nacknowledged by the law of nations, under whatever restraints or\r\nregulations it may take place, may lead to dangerous results. It is far\r\nbetter by other means to supersede any supposed necessity or any motive\r\nfor such examination or visit. Interference with a merchant vessel by an\r\narmed cruiser is always a delicate proceeding, apt to touch the point of\r\nnational honor as well as to affect the interests of individuals. It has\r\nbeen thought, therefore, expedient, not only in accordance with the\r\nstipulations of the treaty of Ghent, but at the same time as removing\r\nall pretext on the part of others for violating the immunities of the\r\nAmerican flag upon the seas, as they exist and are defined by the law\r\nof nations, to enter into the articles now submitted to the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe treaty which I now submit to you proposes no alteration, mitigation,\r\nor modification of the rules of the law of nations. It provides simply\r\nthat each of the two Governments shall maintain on the coast of Africa\r\na sufficient squadron to enforce separately and respectively the laws,\r\nrights, and obligations of the two countries for the suppression of the\r\nslave trade.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration of great importance has recommended this mode of\r\nfulfilling the duties and obligations of the country. Our commerce along\r\nthe western coast of Africa is extensive, and supposed to be increasing.\r\nThere is reason to think that in many cases those engaged in it have met\r\nwith interruptions and annoyances caused by the jealousy and instigation\r\nof rivals engaged in the same trade. Many complaints on this subject\r\nhave reached the Government. A respectable naval force on the coast is\r\nthe natural resort and security against further occurrences of this\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nThe surrender to justice of persons who, having committed high crimes,\r\nseek an asylum in the territories of a neighboring nation would seem to\r\nbe an act due to the cause of general justice and properly belonging to\r\nthe present state of civilization and intercourse. The British Provinces\r\nof North America are separated from the States of the Union by a line of\r\nseveral thousand miles, and along portions of this line the amount of\r\npopulation on either side is quite considerable, while the passage of\r\nthe boundary is always easy.\r\n\r\nOffenders against the law on the one side transfer themselves to the\r\nother. Sometimes, with great difficulty, they are brought to justice,\r\nbut very often they wholly escape. A consciousness of immunity from the\r\npower of avoiding justice in this way instigates the unprincipled and\r\nreckless to the commission of offenses, and the peace and good\r\nneighborhood of the border are consequently often disturbed.\r\n\r\nIn the case of offenders fleeing from Canada into the United States,\r\nthe governors of States are often applied to for their surrender, and\r\nquestions of a very embarrassing nature arise from these applications.\r\nIt has been thought highly important, therefore, to provide for the\r\nwhole case by a proper treaty stipulation. The article on the subject\r\nin the proposed treaty is carefully confined to such offenses as all\r\nmankind agree to regard as heinous and destructive of the security of\r\nlife and property. In this careful and specific enumeration of crimes\r\nthe object has been to exclude all political offenses or criminal\r\ncharges arising from wars or intestine commotions. Treason, misprision\r\nof treason, libels, desertion from military service, and other offenses\r\nof similar character are excluded.\r\n\r\nAnd lest some unforeseen inconvenience or unexpected abuse should arise\r\nfrom the stipulation rendering its continuance in the opinion of one or\r\nboth of the parties not longer desirable, it is left in the power of\r\neither to put an end to it at will.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the steamboat _Caroline_ at Schlosser four or five\r\nyears ago occasioned no small degree of excitement at the time, and\r\nbecame the subject of correspondence between the two Governments. That\r\ncorrespondence, having been suspended for a considerable period, was\r\nrenewed in the spring of the last year, but no satisfactory result\r\nhaving been arrived at, it was thought proper, though the occurrence\r\nhad ceased to be fresh and recent, not to omit attention to it\r\non the present occasion. It has only been so far discussed in the\r\ncorrespondence now submitted as it was accomplished by a violation of\r\nthe territory of the United States. The letter of the British minister,\r\nwhile he attempts to justify that violation upon the ground of a\r\npressing and overruling necessity, admitting, nevertheless, that\r\neven if justifiable an apology was due for it, and accompanying this\r\nacknowledgment with assurances of the sacred regard of his Government\r\nfor the inviolability of national territory, has seemed to me sufficient\r\nto warrant forbearance from any further remonstrance against what took\r\nplace as an aggression on the soil and territory of the country. On the\r\nsubject of the interference of the British authorities in the West\r\nIndies, a confident hope is entertained that the correspondence which\r\nhas taken place, showing the grounds taken by this Government and the\r\nengagements entered into by the British minister, will be found such as\r\nto satisfy the just expectation of the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe impressment of seamen from merchant vessels of this country by\r\nBritish cruisers, although not practiced in time of peace, and therefore\r\nnot at present a productive cause of difference and irritation, has,\r\nnevertheless, hitherto been so prominent a topic of controversy and is\r\nso likely to bring on renewed contentions at the first breaking out of a\r\nEuropean war that it has been thought the part of wisdom now to take it\r\ninto serious and earnest consideration. The letter from the Secretary of\r\nState to the British minister explains the ground which the Government\r\nhas assumed and the principles which it means to uphold. For the defense\r\nof these grounds and the maintenance of these principles the most\r\nperfect reliance is placed on the intelligence of the American people\r\nand on their firmness and patriotism in whatever touches the honor of\r\nthe country or its great and essential interests.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following are inserted because they pertain to the treaty\r\ntransmitted with the message of President Tyler immediately preceding.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, August 3, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State has the honor to transmit to the Senate, in\r\ncompliance with a resolution adopted by it on the 29th ultimo, a copy of\r\n_joint report_ of the commissioners under the treaty of Washington of\r\nAugust 9, 1842, together with a copy of the report of the American\r\ncommissioner transmitting the same to the State Department.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Smith to Mr. Buchanan_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 20, 1848_.\r\n\r\nSIR: In presenting to you the joint report of the commissioners\r\nappointed under the treaty of Washington of August 9, 1842, to survey\r\nand mark the line of boundary between the United States and the British\r\nProvinces, which I have the honor herewith most respectfully to submit,\r\nI have to perform the painful duty of informing you that the maps of\r\nthat line and of the adjacent country, which had been elaborately\r\nconstructed by the scientific corps on the part of the United States,\r\nand contained upon 100 sheets of drawing paper of the largest size,\r\ntogether with the tables of the survey, have been destroyed by the\r\nconflagration of the building in which they were contained. This house\r\nhad been occupied by Major James D. Graham, the head of the scientific\r\ncorps and principal astronomer of the American commission, as his office\r\nuntil his departure for Mexico. All the maps, drawings, and tables had\r\nbeen completed and duly authenticated by the joint commissioners, and\r\nwere ready to be deposited with their joint report under their hands and\r\nseals in the archives of this Government. Of this I had the honor to\r\ninform you in my letter of the 24th ultimo.\r\n\r\nI can hardly express the pain which this unfortunate event has\r\noccasioned me. But I can not perceive that any imputation of blame can\r\nproperly be attached to any officer of the commission. The care and\r\ncustody of all the work of the United States scientific corps were\r\nproperly placed in charge of Major Graham, as the head of that corps,\r\nwho had had the immediate direction and superintendence of it from the\r\nfirst organization of the commission. He required the maps and tables\r\nat his office for reference and revision in the progress of the\r\nastronomical work. Upon his departure for Mexico he placed Lieutenant\r\nA.W. Whipple in his rooms with an injunction to guard with the utmost\r\ncare the valuable property of the commission. On the day after he left\r\nthe city, and when for the first time informed of the fact, I called\r\nupon Lieutenant Whipple and requested him to have all the maps,\r\ndrawings, and tables ready to be turned over to the State Department on\r\nthe following day. On the 24th ultimo I acquainted you with that fact.\r\n\r\nNo censure can possibly be attributed to Lieutenant Whipple, whose great\r\ncare and attention to all his duties have been on all occasions highly\r\ndistinguished. He escaped from the fire with scarcely an article of his\r\ndress, and his loss in money and clothing is at least $1,000. Major\r\nGraham has lost his valuable library, together with personal effects\r\nto a large amount. The fire was communicated from the basement of the\r\nhouse, and by no effort could anything be saved.\r\n\r\nThere are tracings of the maps upon \"tissue paper,\" without the\r\ntopography, in the State of Maine, but they are not signed by the\r\ncommissioners.\r\n\r\nThe field books of the engineers were, fortunately, not in Major\r\nGraham's office, and are preserved.\r\n\r\nDuplicates of the maps, duly authenticated, have been placed in the\r\nBritish archives at London, which, although they have not the topography\r\nof the country so fully laid down upon them as it was upon our own,\r\nrepresent with equal exactness the survey of the boundary itself. Should\r\nit be deemed expedient by this Government to procure copies of them,\r\naccess to those archives for that purpose would undoubtedly be\r\npermitted, and the object accomplished at small expense, and when\r\ncompleted these copies could be authenticated by the joint commissioners\r\nin accordance with the provisions of the treaty.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient and humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nALBERT SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Report of the joint commission of boundary appointed under the treaty\r\nof Washington of August 9, 1842_.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, commissioners appointed under the treaty of Washington\r\nto trace and mark the boundary, as directed by that treaty, between the\r\nBritish possessions in North America and the United States--that is to\r\nsay, James Bucknall Bucknall Estcourt, lieutenant-colonel in the British\r\narmy, appointed commissioner by Her Britannic Majesty, and Albert Smith,\r\nappointed commissioner by the President of the United States--having\r\naccomplished the duty assigned to them, do now, in accordance with the\r\ndirections of the said treaty, submit the following report and the\r\naccompanying maps, jointly signed, to their respective Governments.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the terms of the treaty, the undersigned met at Bangor,\r\nin the State of Maine, on the 1st day of May, 1843, where they produced\r\nand verified the authority under which they each were respectively to\r\nact. They then adjourned, because the weather was not sufficiently open\r\nfor taking the field, to the 1st of the following month (June), and\r\nagreed to meet again at that time at Houlton.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, they did meet at that place, and began their operations.\r\n\r\nIt may be desirable to state at the outset that for the sake of\r\nconvenience the whole line of boundary marked by the undersigned has\r\nbeen divided in the mention made of the different portions into the\r\nfollowing grand divisions, viz:\r\n\r\n\"North line,\" from the source of the St. Croix to the intersection of\r\nthe St. John.\r\n\r\n\"River St. John,\" from the intersection of the north line to the mouth\r\nof the St. Francis.\r\n\r\n\"River St. Francis,\" from its mouth to the outlet of Lake Pohenagamook.\r\n\r\n\"Southwest line,\" from the outlet of Lake Pohenagamook to the Northwest\r\nBranch of the St. John.\r\n\r\n\"South line,\" from the Northwest Branch to the parallel of latitude 46°\r\n25' on the Southwest Branch.\r\n\r\n\"Southwest Branch,\" from the parallel 46° 25' to its source.\r\n\r\n\"Highlands,\" from the source of the Southwest Branch of the St. John to\r\nthe source of Halls Stream.\r\n\r\n\"Halls Stream,\" from its source to the intersection of the line of\r\nValentine and Collins.\r\n\r\n\"West line,\" from Halls Stream to the St. Lawrence near St. Regis, along\r\nthe line of Valentine and Collins.\r\n\r\nTo return to the narration of operations:\r\n\r\nThe exploring line of Colonel Bouchette and Mr. Johnson, as directed by\r\nthe treaty, was traced from the monument at the source of the St. Croix\r\nto the intersection of the St. John.\r\n\r\nThe monument found at the source of the St. Croix, as described in the\r\nreport of Colonel Bouchette and Mr. Johnson, and the course of their\r\nexploring line, was traced by blazes or marks upon the trees.\r\n\r\nAn old line, cut out by the assistant surveyors of Colonel Bouchette and\r\nMr. Johnson, was also found, which terminated about half a mile north\r\nof the South Branch of the Meduxnikeag, where, by records to which the\r\nundersigned referred, they ascertained that it had been abandoned\r\nbecause of its deviation from the exploring line of Colonel Bouchette\r\nand Mr. Johnson.\r\n\r\nAfter the exploration and re-marking of the north line it was cut out 30\r\nfeet wide. The same was afterwards done in all parts where the boundary\r\npassed through woodland. After thus opening the north line it was\r\nsurveyed, and iron posts were erected at intervals to mark it.\r\n\r\nThe general bearing of the line was rather to the west of the meridian\r\nof the monument at the source of the St. Croix. The precise line laid\r\ndown by the undersigned was determined by successive courses, of which\r\neach was made to be as long as was convenient, provided it did not pass\r\nout of the opening of 30 feet.\r\n\r\nAt each angle of deflection an iron monument was erected, and placed\r\nanglewise with the line. Other monuments were erected at the crossing of\r\nroads, rivers, and at every mile, commencing from the source of the St.\r\nCroix. Those which were not intended to mark angles of deflection were\r\nplaced square with the line.\r\n\r\nAt the intersection of the St. John by the north line the river is deep\r\nand broad. The boundary runs up the middle of the channel of the river,\r\nas indicated by the maps, dividing the islands as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  No. 1.  Ryan's Island................................

Grew's Island................................ United States.\r\n  No. 20. Kendall's Island............................. Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe islands were distributed to Great Britain or to the United States,\r\nas they were found to be on the right or left of the deep channel. There\r\nwas but one doubtful case, La Septieme Isle, and that was apportioned to\r\nthe United States because the majority of the owners were ascertained to\r\nreside on the United States side of the river.\r\n\r\nMonuments were erected upon the islands, marking them for Great Britain\r\nor the United States, as the case may have been.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the St. John the boundary enters the St. Francis, dividing\r\nthe islands at the mouth of that river in the manner shown in the maps.\r\nIt then runs up the St. Francis, through the middle of the lakes upon\r\nit, to the outlet of Lake Pohenagamook, the third large lake from the\r\nmouth of the river. At the outlet a large monument has been erected.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the point on the Northwest Branch to which the\r\ntreaty directed that a straight line should be run from the outlet of\r\nLake Pohenagamook, a survey of that stream was made, and also of the\r\nmain St. John in the neighborhood of the mouth of the Northwest Branch,\r\nand a line was cut between the St. John and the point on the Northwest\r\nBranch ascertained by the survey to be 10 miles in the nearest direction\r\nfrom it, and the distance was afterwards verified by chaining.\r\n\r\nIt was ascertained also, in accordance with the provisions of the\r\ntreaty, by a triangulation of the country toward the highlands dividing\r\nthe waters of the St. Lawrence and of the St. John, that more than 7\r\nmiles intervened between the point selected on the Northwest Branch and\r\nthe crest of the dividing ridge. A large iron monument was afterwards\r\nerected on the point thus selected, and the space around was cleared and\r\nsown with grass seed. It is a short distance below the outlet of Lake\r\nIshaganalshegeck.\r\n\r\nThe outlet of Lake Pohenagamook and the point on the Northwest Branch\r\ndesignated by the treaty having been thus ascertained and marked, in the\r\nspring of 1844 a straight line was run between them. Along that line,\r\nwhich passes entirely through forest, monuments were erected at every\r\nmile, at the crossings of the principal streams and rivers, and at the\r\ntops of those hills where a transit instrument had been set up to test\r\nthe straightness of the line.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the parallel of latitude 46° 25' had been determined on the\r\nSouthwest Branch, in the early part of the summer of 1844, a straight\r\nline was drawn from the boundary point on the Northwest Branch to a\r\nlarge monument erected on the left bank of the Southwest Branch where it\r\nis intersected by the parallel of latitude 46° 25'. The line so drawn\r\ncrosses the Southwest Branch once before it reaches the parallel of\r\nlatitude 46° 25', and at about half a mile distance from that parallel.\r\nThere also a large monument has been set up on the left bank.\r\n\r\nFrom the intersection of the parallel 46° 25' the boundary ascends the\r\nSouthwest Branch, passes through a lake near its head, and so up a small\r\nstream which falls into the lake from the west to the source of that\r\nstream, which has been selected as the source of the Southwest Branch.\r\n\r\nOn the Southwest Branch there are two principal forks, at each of\r\nwhich two monuments have been erected, one on each bank of the river\r\nimmediately above the forks and upon the branch established as the\r\nboundary. The maps point out their positions. At the mouth of the small\r\nstream selected as the source of the Southwest Branch a monument has\r\nbeen erected upon a delta formed by two small outlets. Above those\r\noutlets three other monuments have been placed at intervals upon the\r\nsame stream.\r\n\r\nUpon the crest of the dividing ridge, very close to the source of the\r\nSouthwest Branch, a large monument has been erected. It is the first\r\npoint in the highlands, and from it the boundary runs along the crest\r\nin a southerly direction, passing near to the southeastern shore of the\r\nPortage Lake, and so on to a large monument erected on a small eminence\r\non the east side of the Kennebec road. Thence it passes through a\r\ndwelling house called Tachereau's, which was standing there at the time\r\nthe line was run; so, by a tortuous course, it runs to the top of Sandy\r\nStream Mountain; thence, inclining to the southwest, it runs over Hog\r\nBack the First, as shown in the maps; thence toward Hog Back the Second,\r\nwhich it leaves on the north side. Further on, at the head of Leech\r\nLake, there is a stream which divides its waters and flows both into\r\nCanada and into the United States. The boundary has been made to run up\r\nthat stream a short distance from the fork where the waters divide to a\r\nsecond fork; thence between the streams which unite to form that fork,\r\nand then to ascend again the dividing ridge. A monument has been erected\r\nat the fork first mentioned, where the waters divide.\r\n\r\nAs the boundary approaches the valley of Spider River it bends to the\r\nsoutheast, and, by a wide circuit over high and steep hills, it turns\r\nthe head of Spider River; thence it bends to the northwest until it\r\napproaches within about 4 miles of Lake Megantic; thence it turns again\r\nsouth, having the valley of Arnolds River on the right and of Dead River\r\non the left. It leaves Gasford Mountain in Canada, threads its way over\r\nvery high ground between the head of Arnolds River and the tributaries\r\nof the Magalloway; inclines then to the north, so to the west, over very\r\nrocky, mountainous, and difficult country, leaving Gipps Peak in the\r\nUnited States, and turns by a sharp angle at Saddle Back to the south.\r\nAfter that it again inclines to the west, and then to the south, and\r\nagain to the west, and passes the head of the Connecticut. About 3 miles\r\nand a half east of the head of the Connecticut there is a division of\r\nwaters similar to that described near Leech Lake. The boundary runs down\r\na stream from near its source to the fork where it divides, and then\r\nagain follows the dividing ridge. The spot is noted on the map.\r\n\r\nAfter the boundary has passed the head of the Connecticut it runs to the\r\nnorthwest, descending into very low, swampy ground between the heads of\r\nIndian Stream and the tributaries of the St. Francis. Thus it passes on,\r\nbending again to the south of west, over a high hill, to the source of\r\nHalls Stream.\r\n\r\nIron monuments have been erected at intervals along the highlands from\r\nthe source of the Southwest Branch of the St. John to the source of\r\nHalls Stream, the position of each of which is shown upon the maps.\r\n\r\nFrom the source of Halls Stream the boundary descends that river,\r\ndividing the islands, which are, however, merely unimportant alluvial\r\ndeposits, in the manner indicated by the maps until it reaches the\r\nintersection of that stream by the line formerly run by Valentine and\r\nCollins as the forty-fifth degree of north latitude.\r\n\r\nAt that point a large monument has been erected on the right and a small\r\none on the left bank of the stream. Monuments have also been erected\r\nalong the bank of this stream, as indicated on the maps.\r\n\r\nThe line of Valentine and Collins was explored and found by the blazes\r\nstill remaining in the original forest.\r\n\r\nUpon cutting into those blazes it was seen that deep seated in the tree\r\nthere was a scar, the surface of the original blaze, slightly decayed,\r\nand upon counting the rings (which indicate each year's growth of the\r\ntree) it was found that the blazes dated back to 1772, 1773, and 1774.\r\nThe line of Valentine and Collins was run in 1771, 1772, 1773, and 1774.\r\nThe coincidence of the dates of the blazes with those of the above line,\r\nconfirmed by the testimony of the people of the country, satisfied the\r\nundersigned that the line they had found was that mentioned in the\r\ntreaty. Along this portion of the boundary, which is known as the\r\nforty-fifth degree of Valentine and Collins, and which extends from\r\nHalls Stream to St. Regis, there are several interruptions to the blazes\r\nin those parts where clearings have been made, and there the authentic\r\nmarks of the precise situation of the old line have been lost. In those\r\ncases the undersigned have drawn the boundary line straight from the\r\noriginal blazes on the one side of a clearing to the original blazes on\r\nthe other side of the same clearing.\r\n\r\nIt can not be positively stated that the line as it has been traced\r\nthrough those clearings precisely coincides with the old line, but the\r\nundersigned believe that it does not differ materially from it; nor have\r\nthey had the means of determining a nearer or a surer approximation.\r\n\r\nAlong this line, at every point of deflection, an iron monument has been\r\nerected; also at the crossing of rivers, lakes, and roads. Those which\r\nmark deflections are placed, as on the \"north line,\" anglewise with the\r\nline; all the others are placed square with it. The maps show the\r\nposition of each.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern shore of Lake Memphremagog an astronomical station was\r\nestablished, and on a large flat rock of granite, which happened to lie\r\nbetween the astronomical station and the boundary, was cut the following\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Capt: Robinson.\r\n                            Ast: Station\r\n                            422 feet north.\r\n                _Meridian_                      _Line._\r\n     -----------------------------()--------------------------------\r\n\r\n                            Boundary Line\r\n                            595 feet south\r\n                            August, 1845.\r\n\r\n                    _British Boundary Commission_\r\n\r\n\r\nA mark was cut upon the stone, as indicated by the dot upon the meridian\r\nline above, from which these measurements were made.\r\n\r\nAt Rouses Point a monument of wrought stone was set up at the\r\nintersection of the boundary by the meridian of the transit instrument\r\nused there by Major Graham, and an inscription was cut upon it stating\r\nthe latitude and longitude, the names of the observer and his assistant,\r\nthe names of the commissioners, and the territories divided.\r\n\r\nTo mark the position of the instruments used at the following\r\nastronomical stations along the west line, two monuments within a few\r\nfeet of each other have been erected at each station, and they have been\r\nplaced on the boundary line due north or south of the instrument, as the\r\ncase may have been.\r\n\r\nThe stations are: Lake Memphremagog, Richford, John McCoy's, Trout River.\r\n\r\nThe boundary along the west line, though very far from being a straight\r\nline, is generally about half a mile north of the true parallel of\r\nlatitude 45° from Halls Stream to Rouses Point. At about 28 miles west\r\nof Rouses Point it, however, crosses that parallel to the south until it\r\nreaches Chateaugay River, where it bends northward, and, crossing the\r\nparallel again about 4 miles east of St. Regis, it strikes the St.\r\nLawrence 151 feet north of 45°. At that point a large monument has been\r\nerected on the bank of the St. Lawrence. Two large monuments have also\r\nbeen erected, one on either side of the river Richelieu near Rouses\r\nPoint.\r\n\r\nNo marks of the old line were to be found about St. Regis. It was\r\ntherefore agreed to run a line due west from the last blaze which should\r\nbe found in the woods on the east side of St. Regis. That blaze occurred\r\nabout 1 mile east of the St. Regis River.\r\n\r\nThe maps, which exhibit the boundary on a scale of 4 inches to 1 statute\r\nmile, consist of 62 consecutive sheets of antiquarian paper as\r\nconstructed by the British and of 61 as constructed by the American\r\ncommission. A general map has also been constructed on a scale of 8\r\nmiles to 1 inch by the British and of 10 miles to 1 inch by the American\r\ncommission, upon which the before-mentioned sheets are represented.\r\n\r\nThe following portions of the boundary have been laid down by the\r\nBritish commission, on detached maps, on a scale of 12 inches to 1 mile,\r\nwhich have been signed by both commissioners:\r\n\r\nGrand Falls of the St. John, including the intersection of that\r\nriver by the north line; islands of the St. John; the outlet of Lake\r\nPohenagamook; the turning point of the boundary on the Northwest Branch\r\nof the St. John; the intersection of the Southwest Branch by the\r\nparallel of latitude 46° 25'; the source of the Southwest Branch; the\r\nsource of Halls Stream; the intersection of Halls Stream by the west\r\nline; Rouses Point; St. Regis; Derby.\r\n\r\nBut similar maps have not been prepared by the American commission,\r\nbecause during the interval between the finishing of the maps of the\r\nBritish commission and those of the American it was thought that the\r\nmaps already constructed upon a scale of 4 inches to 1 mile represented\r\nthe boundary with sufficient clearness and accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe astronomical observations were begun at the Grand Falls early in\r\nJune, 1843, and were carried up the St. John River to the Northwest\r\nBranch by a chain of stations, which, together with the results\r\nobtained, are tabulated in the appendix accompanying this report.\r\n\r\nFrom the valley of the St. John an astronomical connection was made with\r\nQuebec, and thence to Montreal, and so to Rouses Point. From Rouses\r\nPoint a connection was obtained with Cambridge University, near Boston.\r\n\r\nThe astronomical stations on the west line were: Intersection of Halls\r\nStream by the west line, Lake Memphremagog, Richford, Rouses Point, John\r\nMcCoy's, Trout River, St. Regis.\r\n\r\nLatitude was also obtained at an astronomical station established for\r\nthe purpose at the head of the Connecticut.\r\n\r\nVolumes containing the astronomical observations of both commissions are\r\nherewith submitted. From them it will be observed that the results for\r\nabsolute longitude obtained by the British and American astronomers do\r\nnot agree. It being a difference in no way affecting the survey of the\r\nboundary line, the undersigned do not feel called upon to attempt to\r\nreconcile it. The data upon which those results are based may be seen\r\nin the volumes of observations accompanying this report.\r\n\r\nIn the appendix will be found, in a tabular form, the following:\r\n\r\nAn abstract of the survey of the boundary along the north line; an\r\nabstract of the survey of the boundary along the southwest line; an\r\nabstract of the survey of the boundary along the south line; an abstract\r\nof the survey of the boundary along the highlands; an abstract of\r\nthe survey of the boundary along the west line; the position of the\r\nmonuments erected on the Southwest Branch of the St. John and on Halls\r\nStream; the distribution of the islands of the St. John and the\r\nmonuments on them; the guide lines and offsets run by each commission\r\nfor the survey of the highlands; the azimuths of verification for the\r\nsurvey of the highlands; the latitudes and longitudes obtained from the\r\nastronomical observations; the comparative longitudes obtained, and the\r\nmethods used for the purpose.\r\n\r\nUpon comparing the maps of the two commissions it will be seen that the\r\nAmerican commission numbers two monuments more than the British. Those\r\nare to be found, one on the \"Fourth Island,\" in the river St. John, and\r\nthe other on the highlands between the source of the Southwest Branch of\r\nthe river St. John and the Kennebec road.\r\n\r\nOn the maps of the British commission representing the \"west line\" the\r\nname of the town of \"_Derby_\" has been improperly placed north of the\r\nline instead of south of it. Also, on the same maps the direction of\r\nSalmon River, near the western extremity of the \"west line,\" has been\r\nincorrectly laid down from the boundary line northward. A direction has\r\nbeen given to it northeasterly instead of northwesterly.\r\n\r\nThe above two corrections the British commissioner is authorized to make\r\non his maps after his return to England.\r\n\r\nTo avoid unnecessary delay in making their joint report, the undersigned\r\nhave attached their signatures to the maps, although the lettering\r\nof some of the astronomical stations upon the maps of the American\r\ncommission, as well as the alterations before mentioned in the maps of\r\nthe British commission, are yet to be made; but in the maps of both the\r\nboundary has been laid down accurately and definitively, and the\r\nundersigned engage that it shall not be altered in any respect.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion the undersigned have the honor to report that the line of\r\nboundary described in the foregoing statement has been run, marked, and\r\nsurveyed, and the accompanying maps faithfully constructed from that\r\nsurvey.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned take leave to add that the most perfect harmony has\r\nsubsisted between the two commissions from first to last, and that no\r\ndifferences have arisen between the undersigned in the execution of the\r\nduties intrusted to them.\r\n\r\nSigned and sealed in duplicate, at the city of Washington, this 28th day\r\nof June, A.D. 1847.\r\n\r\nJ.B. BUCKNALL ESTCOURT, [SEAL.]\r\n  _Lieutenant-Colonel, Her Britannic Majesty's Commissioner_.\r\n\r\nALBERT SMITH, [SEAL.]\r\n  _United States Commissioner_.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The astronomical computations of the American commission not\r\nbeing completed, and it being unnecessary to defer the signing of the\r\nreport on that account, the American commissioner engages to transmit\r\nthem, with any other papers or tables not yet finished, as soon as they\r\nshall be so, to the British commissioner, through the American minister\r\nresident in London, to whom, upon delivery of the documents, the British\r\ncommissioner will give a receipt, to be transmitted to the American\r\ncommissioner.\r\n\r\nJ. B. BUCKNALL ESTCOURT,\r\n  _Lieutenant-Colonel, H.B.M. Commissioner of Boundary_.\r\n\r\nALBERT SMITH,\r\n  _United States Commissioner_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 18, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to its\r\nratification, a treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation with the\r\nRepublic of Texas, negotiated at the seat of Government of the United\r\nStates between the Secretary of State, duly empowered for that purpose,\r\nand the chargé d'affaires of that Republic.\r\n\r\nIn forming the first commercial treaty between the two Governments an\r\nanxious desire has been felt to introduce such provisions as should\r\npromote the interests of both countries. The immediate proximity of\r\nTexas to the United States and the consequent facility of intercourse,\r\nthe nature of its principal agricultural production, and the relations\r\nwhich both countries bear to several large rivers which are boundaries\r\nbetween them, and which in some part of their course run within the\r\nterritories of both, have caused peculiarities of condition and\r\ninterests which it has been necessary to guard.\r\n\r\nThe treaty provides that Texas shall enjoy a right of deposit for such\r\nof her productions as may be introduced into the United States for\r\nexportation, but upon the condition that the Executive of the United\r\nStates may prescribe such regulations as may be necessary for the proper\r\nenjoyment of the privilege within our territory. It was thought no more\r\nthan reasonable to grant this facility to the trade of Texas, under such\r\nconditions as seem best calculated to guard against abuse or\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe treaty further provides that raw cotton may be imported from either\r\ncountry into the other free of duties. In general it is not wise to\r\nenter into treaty stipulations respecting duties of import; they are\r\nusually much better left to the operation of general laws. But there are\r\ncircumstances existing in this case which have been thought to justify a\r\ndeparture from the general rule, and the addition of it to the number of\r\ninstances, not large, in which regulations of duties of imports have\r\nbeen made the subject of national compact.\r\n\r\nThe United States consume large quantities of raw cotton, but they are\r\nexporters of the article to a still greater extent. Texas, for the\r\npresent at least, exports her whole crop. These exportations are, in\r\ngeneral, to the same foreign markets, and it is supposed to be of no\r\nconsiderable importance to the American producer whether he meets the\r\nTexan product at home or abroad.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is thought that a useful commercial intercourse\r\nwould be promoted in several ways by receiving the raw cotton of Texas\r\nat once into the United States free of duty. The tendency of such a\r\nmeasure is to bring to the United States, in the first instance, Texan\r\ncotton ultimately destined to European markets. The natural effect of\r\nthis, it is supposed, will be to increase the business of the cities of\r\nthe United States to the extent of this importation and exportation,\r\nand to secure a further degree of employment to the navigation of the\r\ncountry. But these are by no means all the benefits which may be\r\nreasonably expected from the arrangement. Texas, at least for a\r\nconsiderable time to come, must import all the manufactured articles\r\nand much of the supplies and provisions necessary for her use and\r\nconsumption. These commodities she will be likely to obtain, if to be\r\nhad, in the markets of the country in which she disposes of her main\r\nannual product. The manufactures of the North and East, therefore, and\r\nthe grain and provisions of the Western States are likely to find in\r\nTexas a demand, increased by whatever augments intercourse between the\r\ntwo countries, and especially by whatever tends to give attraction to\r\nthe cities of the United States as marts for the sale of her great and\r\nprincipal article of export.\r\n\r\nAs a security, however, against unforeseen results or occurrences,\r\nit has been thought advisable to give this article of the treaty a\r\nlimitation of five years.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 23, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nA resolution of the Senate of the 21st of June last requested the\r\nPresident to communicate to the Senate, so far as he might deem it\r\ncompatible with the public interests, what measures, if any, had been\r\ntaken to obtain the recognition by the Mexican Government of such claims\r\nof American citizens as were laid before the late joint commission, but\r\nwere not finally acted on by it, and the satisfaction of such claims as\r\nwere admitted by said commission; also whether any facts had come to his\r\nknowledge calculated to induce a belief that any such claims had been\r\nrejected in consequence of the evidence thereof having been withheld\r\nby the Mexican Government, its officers or agents, and any other\r\ninformation which he might deem it expedient to communicate relative\r\nto said claims; and another resolution of the 6th instant requested\r\nthe President, so far as he might deem it compatible with the public\r\nservice, to communicate to the Senate the measures taken to obtain the\r\nperformance of the stipulations contained in the convention with Mexico\r\nin relation to the awards made by the commissioners and umpire under\r\nsaid convention.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of the correspondence and of the relations between\r\nthe two Governments on these important subjects it is not deemed\r\nconsistent with the public interest to communicate the information\r\nrequested. The business engages earnest attention, and will be made the\r\nsubject of a full communication to Congress at the earliest practicable\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 24, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nOn the 15th day of April, 1842, in virtue of the sentence of a\r\ncourt-martial regularly convened under orders from the Secretary of the\r\nNavy, which received my approval, John H. Clack, who was a captain in\r\nthe Navy, was dismissed the service. Since the confirmation of that\r\nsentence a letter has been addressed by Mr. Paulding, late Secretary\r\nof the Navy, to Captain Clack, which leads to the belief that he had\r\nanalyzed the charges made against Captain Clack, and for reasons which\r\nappeared to him satisfactory and which, according to his letter, he\r\nindorsed on the charges, disposed of the case by refusing to submit it\r\nto a court-martial.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding a diligent search has been made for this document, none\r\nsuch can be found; but the only paper in the office having reference\r\nto this subject is a letter addressed by Mr. Paulding to Lieutenant\r\nBuchanan, a copy of which, together with the original of that of Mr. P.\r\nto Captain C., is herewith communicated. I felt it, however, every way\r\ndue to the high character of Mr. Paulding to consider the fact stated by\r\nhim to be as well sustained by his declaration to that effect as if the\r\nrecord was found, and as the court-martial would not have been ordered\r\nby the present Secretary with the knowledge of the fact stated by Mr.\r\nPaulding, since it would have been improper to have reopened a case once\r\nfinally disposed of, I have felt that it was alike due to the general\r\nservice of the Navy as to Mr. Clack to nominate him for reappointment\r\nto the service.\r\n\r\nI therefore nominate John H. Clack to be a captain in the Navy of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 25, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n11th of June last, upon the subject of claims of citizens of the United\r\nStates against the Government of the Mexican Republic, I transmit a\r\nreport from the Secretary of State and a copy of the report of the\r\ncommissioners on the part of the United States under the late convention\r\nbetween the United States and that Republic.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 29, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI return the bill, which originated in the House of Representatives,\r\nentitled \"An act to extend for a limited period the present laws for\r\nlaying and collecting duties on imports,\" with the following objections:\r\n\r\nIt suspends--in other words, abrogates for the time--the provision of\r\nthe act of 1833, commonly called the \"compromise act.\" The only ground\r\non which this departure from the solemn adjustment of a great and\r\nagitating question seems to have been regarded as expedient is the\r\nalleged necessity of establishing by legislative enactments rules and\r\nregulations for assessing the duties to be levied on imports after the\r\n30th June according to the home valuation, and yet the bill expressly\r\nprovides that \"if before the 1st of August there be no further\r\nlegislation upon the subject, the laws for laying and collecting duties\r\nshall be the same as though this act had not been passed.\" In other\r\nwords, that the act of 1833, imperfect as it is considered, shall in\r\nthat case continue to be and to be executed under such rules and\r\nregulations as previous statutes had prescribed or had enabled the\r\nexecutive department to prescribe for that purpose, leaving the supposed\r\nchasm in the revenue laws just as it was before.\r\n\r\nI am certainly far from being disposed to deny that additional\r\nlegislation upon the subject is very desirable; on the contrary, the\r\nnecessity, as well as difficulty, of establishing uniformity in the\r\nappraisements to be made in conformity with the true intention of that\r\nact was brought to the notice of Congress in my message to Congress at\r\nthe opening of its present session. But however sensible I may be of\r\nthe embarrassments to which the Executive, in the absence of all aid\r\nfrom the superior wisdom of the Legislature, will be liable in the\r\nenforcement of the existing laws, I have not, with the sincerest wish to\r\nacquiesce in its expressed will, been able to persuade myself that the\r\nexigency of the occasion is so great as to justify me in signing the\r\nbill in question with my present views of its character and effects. The\r\nexisting laws, as I am advised, are sufficient to authorize and enable\r\nthe collecting officers, under the directions of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, to levy the duties imposed by the act of 1833.\r\n\r\nThat act was passed under peculiar circumstances, to which it is not\r\nnecessary that I should do more than barely allude. Whatever maybe,\r\nin theory, its character, I have always regarded it as importing the\r\nhighest moral obligation. It has now existed for nine years unchanged in\r\nany essential particular, with as general acquiescence, it is believed,\r\nof the whole country as that country has ever manifested for any of her\r\nwisely established institutions. It has insured to it the repose which\r\nalways flows from truly wise and moderate counsels--a repose the more\r\nstriking because of the long and angry agitations which preceded it.\r\nThis salutary law proclaims in express terms the principle which, while\r\nit led to the abandonment of a scheme of indirect taxation founded on a\r\nfalse basis and pushed to dangerous excess, justifies any enlargement\r\nof duties that may be called for by the real exigencies of the public\r\nservice. It provides \"that duties shall be laid for the purpose of\r\nraising such revenue as may be necessary to an economical administration\r\nof the Government.\" It is therefore in the power of Congress to lay\r\nduties as high as its discretion may dictate for the necessary uses of\r\nthe Government without infringing upon the objects of the act of 1833.\r\nI do not doubt that the exigencies of the Government do require an\r\nincrease of the tariff of duties above 20 per cent, and I as little\r\ndoubt that Congress may, above as well as below that rate, so\r\ndiscriminate as to give incidental protection to manufacturing industry,\r\nthus to make the burdens which it is compelled to impose upon the people\r\nfor the purposes of Government productive of a double benefit. This\r\nmost of the reasonable opponents of protective duties seem willing to\r\nconcede, and, if we may judge from the manifestations of public opinion\r\nin all quarters, this is all that the manufacturing interests really\r\nrequire. I am happy in the persuasion that this double object can be\r\nmost easily and effectually accomplished at the present juncture without\r\nany departure from the spirit and principle of the statute in question.\r\nThe manufacturing classes have now an opportunity which may never occur\r\nagain of permanently identifying their interests with those of the whole\r\ncountry, and making them, in the highest sense of the term, a national\r\nconcern. The moment is propitious to the interests of the whole country\r\nin the introduction of harmony among all its parts and all its several\r\ninterests. The same rate of imposts, and no more, as will most surely\r\nreestablish the public credit will secure to the manufacturer all the\r\nprotection he ought to desire, with every prospect of permanence and\r\nstability which the hearty acquiescence of the whole country on a\r\nreasonable system can hold out to him.\r\n\r\nBut of this universal acquiescence, and the harmony and confidence and\r\nthe many other benefits that will certainly result from it, I regard\r\nthe suspension of the law for distributing the proceeds of the sales\r\nof the public lands as an indispensable condition. This measure is, in\r\nmy judgment, called for by a large number, if not a great majority, of\r\nthe people of the United States; by the state of the public credit and\r\nfinances; by the critical posture of our various foreign relations;\r\nand, above all, by that most sacred of all duties--public faith. The\r\nact of September last, which provides for the distribution, couples it\r\ninseparably with the condition that it shall cease--first, in case of\r\nwar; second, as soon and so long as the rate of duties shall for any\r\nreason whatever be raised above 20 per cent. Nothing can be more clear,\r\nexpress, or imperative than this language. It is in vain to allege that\r\na deficit in the Treasury was known to exist and that means were taken\r\nto supply this deficit by loan when the act was passed. It is true that\r\na loan was authorized at the same session during which the distribution\r\nlaw was passed, but the most sanguine of the friends of the two measures\r\nentertained no doubt but that the loan would be eagerly sought after and\r\ntaken up by capitalists and speedily reimbursed by a country destined,\r\nas they hoped, soon to enjoy an overflowing prosperity. The very terms\r\nof the loan, making it redeemable _in three years_, demonstrate this\r\nbeyond all cavil. Who at the time foresaw or imagined the possibility of\r\nthe present real state of things, when a nation that has paid off her\r\nwhole debt since the last peace, while all the other great powers have\r\nbeen increasing theirs, and whose resources, already so great, are yet\r\nbut in the infancy of their development, should be compelled to haggle\r\nin the money market for a paltry sum not equal to one year's revenue\r\nupon her economical system? If the distribution law is to be\r\nindefinitely suspended, according not only to its own terms, but by\r\nuniversal consent, in the case of war, wherein are the actual exigencies\r\nof the country or the moral obligation to provide for them less under\r\npresent circumstances than they could be were we actually involved in\r\nwar? It appears to me to be the indispensable duty of all concerned in\r\nthe administration of public affairs to see that a state of things so\r\nhumiliating and so perilous should not last a moment longer than is\r\nabsolutely unavoidable. Much less excusable should we be in parting\r\nwith any portion of our available means, at least until the demands\r\nof the Treasury are fully supplied. But besides the urgency of such\r\nconsiderations, the fact is undeniable that the distribution act could\r\nnot have become a law without the guaranty in the proviso of the act\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThis connection, thus meant to be inseparable, is severed by the bill\r\npresented to me. The bill violates the principle of the acts of 1833 and\r\nSeptember, 1841, by suspending the first and rendering for a time the\r\nlast inoperative. Duties above 20 per cent are proposed to be levied,\r\nand yet the _proviso_ in the distribution act is disregarded. The\r\nproceeds of the sales are to be distributed on the 1st of August, so\r\nthat, while the duties proposed to be enacted exceed 20 per cent, no\r\nsuspension of the distribution to the States is permitted to take place.\r\nTo abandon the principle for a month is to open the way for its total\r\nabandonment. If such is not meant, why postpone at all? Why not let the\r\ndistribution take place on the 1st of July if the law so directs (which,\r\nhowever, is regarded as questionable)? But why not have limited the\r\nprovision to that effect? Is it for the accommodation of the Treasury?\r\nI see no reason to believe that the Treasury will be in better condition\r\nto meet the payment on the 1st of August than on the 1st of July.\r\n\r\nThe bill assumes that a distribution of the proceeds of the public\r\nlands is, by existing laws, to be made on the 1st day of July, 1842,\r\nnotwithstanding there has been an imposition of duties on imports\r\nexceeding 20 per cent up to that day, and directs it to be made on the\r\n1st of August next. It seems to me very clear that this conclusion is\r\nequally erroneous and dangerous, as it would divert from the Treasury a\r\nfund sacredly pledged for the general purposes of the Government in the\r\nevent of a rate of duty above 20 per cent being found necessary for an\r\neconomical administration of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe bill under consideration is designed only as a temporary measure;\r\nand thus a temporary measure, passed merely for the convenience of\r\nCongress, is made to affect the vital principle of an important act.\r\nIf the proviso of the act of September, 1841, can be suspended for the\r\nwhole period of a temporary law, why not for the whole period of a\r\npermanent law? In fact, a doubt may be well entertained, according to\r\nstrict legal rules, whether the condition, having been thus expressly\r\nsuspended by this bill and rendered inapplicable to a case where it\r\nwould otherwise have clearly applied, will not be considered as ever\r\nafter satisfied and gone. Without expressing any decided opinion on this\r\npoint, I see enough in it to justify me in adhering to the law as it\r\nstands in preference to subjecting a condition so vitally affecting the\r\npeace of the country, and so solemnly enacted at a momentous crisis, and\r\nso steadfastly adhered to ever since, and so replete, if adhered to,\r\nwith good to every interest of the country, to doubtful or captious\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\nIn discharging the high duties thus imposed on me by the Constitution I\r\nrepeat to the House my entire willingness to cooperate in all financial\r\nmeasures, constitutional and proper, which in its wisdom it may judge\r\nnecessary and proper to reestablish the credit of the Government.\r\nI believe that the proceeds of the sales of the public lands being\r\nrestored to the Treasury--or, more properly speaking, the proviso of\r\nthe act of September, 1841, being permitted to remain in full force--a\r\ntariff of duties may easily be adjusted, which, while it will yield a\r\nrevenue sufficient to maintain the Government in vigor by restoring its\r\ncredit, will afford ample protection and infuse a new life into all our\r\nmanufacturing establishments. The condition of the country calls for\r\nsuch legislation, and it will afford me the most sincere pleasure to\r\ncooperate in it.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 9, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIt is with unfeigned regret that I find myself under the necessity of\r\nreturning to the House of Representatives with my objections a bill\r\nentitled \"An act to provide revenue from imports, and to change and\r\nmodify existing laws imposing duties on imports, and for other\r\npurposes.\" Nothing can be more painful to any individual called upon to\r\nperform the Chief Executive duties under our limited Constitution than\r\nto be constrained to withhold his assent from an important measure\r\nadopted by the Legislature. Yet he would neither fulfill the high\r\npurposes of his station nor consult the true interests or the solemn\r\nwill of the people--the common constituents of both branches of the\r\nGovernment--by yielding his well-considered, most deeply fixed, and\r\nrepeatedly declared opinions on matters of great public concernment to\r\nthose of a coordinate department without requesting that department\r\nseriously to reexamine the subject of their difference. The exercise of\r\nsome independence of judgment in regard to all acts of legislation is\r\nplainly implied in the responsibility of approving them. At all times\r\na duty, it becomes a peculiarly solemn and imperative one when the\r\nsubjects passed upon by Congress happen to involve, as in the present\r\ninstance, the most momentous issues, to affect variously the various\r\nparts of a great country, and to have given rise in all quarters to such\r\na conflict of opinion as to render it impossible to conjecture with any\r\ncertainty on which side the majority really is. Surely if the pause for\r\nreflection intended by the wise authors of the Constitution by referring\r\nthe subject back to Congress for reconsideration be ever expedient and\r\nnecessary it is precisely such a case as the present.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of distributing the proceeds of the sales of the public\r\nlands in the existing state of the finances it has been my duty to make\r\nknown my settled convictions on various occasions during the present\r\nsession of Congress. At the opening of the extra session, upward of\r\ntwelve months ago, sharing fully in the general hope of returning\r\nprosperity and credit, I recommended such a distribution, but that\r\nrecommendation was even then expressly coupled with the condition that\r\nthe duties on imports should not exceed the rate of 20 per cent provided\r\nby the compromise act of 1833. These hopes were not a little encouraged\r\nand these views strengthened by the report of Mr. Ewing, then Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, which was shortly thereafter laid before Congress, in\r\nwhich he recommended the imposition of duties at the rate of 20 per cent\r\n_ad valorem_ on all free articles, with specified exceptions, and stated\r\n\"if this measure be adopted there will be received in the Treasury from\r\ncustoms in the last quarter of the present year (1841) $5,300,000; in\r\nall of the year 1842, about $22,500,000; and in the year 1843, after the\r\nfinal reduction under the act of March 2, 1833, about $20,800,000;\" and\r\nadds:\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is believed that after the heavy expenditures required by the public\r\n  service in the present year shall have been provided for, the revenues\r\n  which will accrue from that or a nearly approximate rate of duty will\r\n  be sufficient to defray the expenses of the Government and leave a\r\n  surplus to be annually applied to the gradual payment of the national\r\n  debt, leaving the proceeds of _the public lands_ to be disposed of as\r\n  Congress shall see fit.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was most happy that Congress at the time seemed entirely to concur in\r\nthe recommendations of the Executive, and, anticipating the correctness\r\nof the Secretary's conclusions, and in view of an actual surplus, passed\r\nthe distribution act of the 4th September last, wisely limiting its\r\noperation by two conditions having reference, both of them, to a\r\npossible state of the Treasury different from that which had been\r\nanticipated by the Secretary of the Treasury and to the paramount\r\nnecessities of the public service. It ordained that \"if at any time\r\nduring the existence of that act there should be an imposition of duties\r\non imports inconsistent with the provision of the act of the 2d March,\r\n1833, and beyond the rate of duties fixed by that act, to wit, 20 per\r\ncent on the value of such imports or any of them, then the distribution\r\nshould be suspended, and should continue so suspended until that cause\r\nshould be removed,\" By a previous clause it had, in a like spirit of\r\nwise and cautious patriotism, provided for another case, in which all\r\nare even now agreed, that the proceeds of the sales of the public lands\r\nshould be used for the defense of the country. It was enacted that the\r\nact should continue and be in force until otherwise provided by law,\r\nunless the United States should become involved in war with any foreign\r\npower, in which event, from the commencement of hostilities, the act\r\nshould be suspended until the cessation of hostilities.\r\n\r\nNot long after the opening of the present session of Congress the\r\nunprecedented and extraordinary difficulties that have recently\r\nembarrassed the finances of the country began to assume a serious\r\naspect. It soon became quite evident that the hopes under which the act\r\nof 4th September was passed, and which alone justified it in the eyes\r\neither of Congress who imposed or of the Executive who approved, the\r\nfirst of the two conditions just recited were not destined to be\r\nfulfilled. Under the pressure, therefore, of the embarrassments which\r\nhad thus unexpectedly arisen it appeared to me that the course to be\r\npursued had been clearly marked out for the Government by that act\r\nitself. The condition contemplated in it as requiring a suspension of\r\nits operation had occurred. It became necessary in the opinions of all\r\nto raise the rate of duties upon imports above 20 per cent; and with a\r\nview both to provide available means to meet present exigencies and to\r\nlay the foundation for a successful negotiation of a loan, I felt it\r\nincumbent on me to urge upon Congress to raise the duties accordingly,\r\nimposing them in a spirit of a wise discrimination for the twofold\r\nobject of affording ample revenue for the Government and incidental\r\nprotection to the various branches of domestic industry. I also pressed,\r\nin the most emphatic but respectful language I could employ, the\r\nnecessity of making the land sales available to the Treasury, as the\r\nbasis of public credit. I did not think that I could stand excused, much\r\nless justified, before the people of the United States, nor could I\r\nreconcile it to myself to recommend the imposition of additional taxes\r\nupon them without at the same time urging the employment of all the\r\nlegitimate means of the Government toward satisfying its wants. These\r\nopinions were communicated in advance of any definitive action of\r\nCongress on the subject either of the tariff or land sales, under a high\r\nsense of public duty and in compliance with an express injunction of the\r\nConstitution, so that if a collision, extremely to be deprecated, as\r\nsuch collisions always are, has seemingly arisen between the executive\r\nand legislative branches of the Government, it has assuredly not been\r\nowing to any capricious interference or to any want of a plain and frank\r\ndeclaration of opinion on the part of the former. Congress differed in\r\nits views with those of the Executive, as it had undoubtedly a right to\r\ndo, and passed a bill virtually for a time repealing the proviso of the\r\nact of the 4th September, 1841. The bill was returned to the House in\r\nwhich it originated with my objections to its becoming a law. With a\r\nview to prevent, if possible, an open disagreement of opinion on a point\r\nso important, I took occasion to declare that I regarded it as an\r\nindispensable prerequisite to an increase of duties above 20 per cent\r\nthat the act of the 4th September should remain unrepealed in its\r\nprovisions. My reasons for that opinion were elaborately set forth\r\nin the message which accompanied the return of the bill, which no\r\nconstitutional majority appears to have been found for passing into\r\na law.\r\n\r\nThe bill which is now before me proposes in its twenty-seventh section\r\nthe total repeal of one of the provisos in the act of September,\r\nand, while it increases the duties above 20 per cent, directs an\r\nunconditional distribution of the land proceeds. I am therefore\r\nsubjected a second time in the period of a few days to the necessity of\r\neither giving my approval to a measure which, in my deliberate judgment,\r\nis in conflict with great public interests or of returning it to the\r\nHouse in which it originated with my objections. With all my anxiety for\r\nthe passage of a law which would replenish an exhausted Treasury and\r\nfurnish a sound and healthy encouragement to mechanical industry, I can\r\nnot consent to do so at the sacrifice of the peace and harmony of the\r\ncountry and the clearest convictions of public duty.\r\n\r\nFor some of the reasons which have brought me to this conclusion I refer\r\nto my previous messages to Congress, and briefly subjoin the following:\r\n\r\n1. The bill unites two subjects which, so far from having any affinity\r\nto one another, are wholly incongruous in their character. It is both a\r\nrevenue and an appropriation bill. It thus imposes on the Executive, in\r\nthe first place, the necessity of either approving that which he would\r\nreject or rejecting that which he might otherwise approve. This is a\r\nspecies of constraint to which the judgment of the Executive ought not,\r\nin my opinion, to be subjected. But that is not my only objection to the\r\nact in its present form. The union of subjects wholly dissimilar in\r\ntheir character in the same bill, if it grew into a practice, would not\r\nfail to lead to consequences destructive of all wise and conscientious\r\nlegislation. Various measures, each agreeable only to a small minority,\r\nmight by being thus united--and the more the greater chance of\r\nsuccess--lead to the passing of laws of which no single provision could\r\nif standing alone command a majority in its favor.\r\n\r\n2. While the Treasury is in a state of extreme embarrassment,\r\nrequiring every dollar which it can make available, and when the\r\nGovernment has not only to lay additional taxes, but to borrow money\r\nto meet pressing demands, the bill proposes to give away a fruitful\r\nsource of revenue--which is the same thing as raising money by loan\r\nand taxation--not to meet the wants of the Government, but for\r\ndistribution--a proceeding which I must regard as highly impolitic,\r\nif not unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nA brief review of the present condition of the public finances will\r\nserve to illustrate the true condition of the Treasury and exhibit\r\nits actual necessities:\r\n\r\n\r\n  On the 5th of August (Friday last) there was\r\n  in the Treasury, in round numbers                        $2,150,000\r\n\r\n  Necessary to be retained to meet trust funds   $360,000\r\n  Interest on public debt due in October           80,000\r\n  To redeem Treasury notes and pay the interest   100,000\r\n  Land distribution under the act of the 4th of\r\n  September, 1841                                 640,000\r\n                                                 ________   1,180,000\r\n                                                           __________\r\n  Leaving an available amount of                              970,000\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Navy Department had drawn requisitions on the Treasury at that time\r\nto meet debts actually due, among which are bills under protest for\r\n$1,414,000, thus leaving an actual deficit of $444,000.\r\n\r\nThere was on hand about $100,000 of unissued Treasury notes, assisted by\r\nthe accruing revenue (amounting to about $150,000 per week, exclusive of\r\nreceipts on unpaid bonds), to meet requisitions for the Army and the\r\ndemands of the civil list.\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal of the sum of $640,000 to be distributed among the\r\nStates, so soon as the statements and accounts can be made up and\r\ncompleted, by virtue of the provisions of the act of the 4th of\r\nSeptember last (of which nearly a moiety goes to a few States, and only\r\nabout $383,000 is to be divided among all the States), while it adds\r\nmaterially to the embarrassments of the Treasury, affords to the States\r\nno decided relief.\r\n\r\nNo immediate relief from this state of things is anticipated unless\r\n(what would most deeply be deplored) the Government could be reconciled\r\nto the negotiation of loans already authorized by law at a rate of\r\ndiscount ruinous in itself and calculated most seriously to affect the\r\npublic credit. So great is the depression of trade that even if the\r\npresent bill were to become a law and prove to be productive some time\r\nwould elapse before sufficient supplies would flow into the Treasury,\r\nwhile in the meantime its embarrassments would be continually augmented\r\nby the semiannual distribution of the land proceeds.\r\n\r\nIndeed, there is but too much ground to apprehend that even if this bill\r\nwere permitted to become a law--alienating, as it does, the proceeds of\r\nthe land sales--an actual deficit in the Treasury would occur, which\r\nwould more than probably involve the necessity of a resort to direct\r\ntaxation.\r\n\r\nLet it be also remarked that $5,500,000 of the public debt becomes\r\nredeemable in about two years and a half, which at any sacrifice must\r\nbe met, while the Treasury is always liable to demands for the payment\r\nof outstanding Treasury notes. Such is the gloomy picture which our\r\nfinancial department now presents, and which calls for the exercise of a\r\nrigid economy in the public expenditures and the rendering available of\r\nall the means within the control of the Government. I most respectfully\r\nsubmit whether this is a time to give away the proceeds of the land\r\nsales when the public lands constitute a fund which of all others may be\r\nmade most useful in sustaining the public credit. Can the Government be\r\ngenerous and munificent to others when every dollar it can command is\r\nnecessary to supply its own wants? And if Congress would not hesitate\r\nto suffer the provisions of the act of 4th September last to remain\r\nunrepealed in case the country was involved in war, is not the necessity\r\nfor such a course now just as imperative as it would be then?\r\n\r\n3. A third objection remains to be urged, which would be sufficient in\r\nitself to induce me to return the bill to the House with my objections.\r\nBy uniting two subjects so incongruous as tariff and distribution it\r\ninevitably makes the fate of the one dependent upon that of the other\r\nin future contests of party. Can anything be more fatal to the merchant\r\nor manufacturer than such an alliance? What they most of all require\r\nis a system of moderate duties so arranged as to withdraw the tariff\r\nquestion, as far as possible, completely from the arena of political\r\ncontention. Their chief want is permanency and stability. Such an\r\nincrease of the tariff I believe to be necessary in order to meet the\r\neconomical expenditures of Government. Such an increase, made in the\r\nspirit of moderation and judicious discrimination, would, I have no\r\ndoubt, be entirely satisfactory to the great majority of the American\r\npeople. In the way of accomplishing a measure so salutary and so\r\nimperatively demanded by every public interest, the legislative\r\ndepartment will meet with a cordial cooperation on the part of the\r\nExecutive. This is all that the manufacturer can desire, and it would be\r\na burden readily borne by the people. But I can not too earnestly repeat\r\nthat in order to be beneficial it must be permanent, and in order to be\r\npermanent it must command general acquiescence. But can such permanency\r\nbe justly hoped for if the tariff question be coupled with that of\r\ndistribution, as to which a serious conflict of opinion exists among the\r\nStates and the people, and which enlists in its support a bare majority,\r\nif, indeed, there be a majority, of the two Houses of Congress? What\r\npermanency or stability can attach to a measure which, warring upon\r\nitself, gives away a fruitful source of revenue at the moment it\r\nproposes a large increase of taxes on the people? Is the manufacturer\r\nprepared to stake himself and his interests upon such an issue?\r\n\r\nI know that it is urged (but most erroneously, in my opinion) that\r\ninstability is just as apt to be produced by retaining the public lands\r\nas a source of revenue as from any other cause, and this is ascribed to\r\na constant fluctuation, as it is said, in the amount of sales. If there\r\nwere anything in this objection, it equally applies to every imposition\r\nof duties on imports. The amount of revenue annually derived from duties\r\nis constantly liable to change. The regulations of foreign governments,\r\nthe varying productiveness of other countries, periods of excitement\r\nin trade, and a great variety of other circumstances are constantly\r\narising to affect the state of commerce, foreign and domestic, and, of\r\nconsequence, the revenue levied upon it. The sales of the public domain\r\nin ordinary times are regulated by fixed laws which have their basis in\r\na demand increasing only in the ratio of the increase of population.\r\nIn recurring to the statistics connected with this subject it will be\r\nperceived that for a period of ten years preceding 1834 the average\r\namount of land sales did not exceed $2,000,000. For the increase which\r\ntook place in 1834, 1835, and 1836 we are to look to that peculiar\r\ncondition of the country which grew out of one of the most extraordinary\r\nexcitements in business and speculation that has ever occurred in the\r\nhistory of commerce and currency. It was the fruit of a wild spirit of\r\nadventure engendered by a vicious system of credits, under the evils of\r\nwhich the country is still laboring, and which it is fondly hoped will\r\nnot soon recur. Considering the vast amount of investments made by\r\nprivate individuals in the public lands during those three years, and\r\nwhich equaled $43,000,000 (equal to more than twenty years' purchase),\r\ntaking the average of sales of the ten preceding years, it may be safely\r\nasserted that the result of the public-land sales can hold out nothing\r\nto alarm the manufacturer with the idea of instability in the revenues\r\nand consequently in the course of the Government.\r\n\r\nUnder what appears to me, therefore, the soundest considerations of\r\npublic policy, and in view of the interests of every branch of domestic\r\nindustry, I return you the bill with these my objections to its becoming\r\na law.\r\n\r\nI take occasion emphatically to repeat my anxious desire to cooperate\r\nwith Congress in the passing of a law which, while it shall assist in\r\nsupplying the wants of the Treasury and reestablish public credit, shall\r\nafford to the manufacturing interests of the country all the incidental\r\nprotection they require.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the effect of what I do is substantially to call on Congress\r\nto reconsider the subject. If on such reconsideration a majority of\r\ntwo-thirds of both Houses should be in favor of this measure, it will\r\nbecome a law notwithstanding my objections. In a case of clear and\r\nmanifest error on the part of the President the presumption of the\r\nConstitution is that such majorities will be found. Should they be\r\nso found in this case, having conscientiously discharged my own duty\r\nI shall cheerfully acquiesce in the result.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTEST.[79]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: The House of Representatives ordered that it be not\r\nentered on the Journal.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 30, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nBy the Constitution of the United States it is provided that \"every bill\r\nwhich shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate\r\nshall before it become a law be presented to the President of the United\r\nStates; _if he approve_, he _shall_ sign it; but if _not_, he _shall_\r\nreturn it with his objections to that House in which it shall have\r\noriginated, who shall enter the objections at large upon the Journal\r\nand proceed to reconsider it.\"\r\n\r\nIn strict compliance with the positive obligation thus imposed upon me\r\nby the Constitution, not having been able to bring myself to approve a\r\nbill which originated in the House of Representatives entitled \"An act\r\nto provide revenue from imports, and to change and modify existing laws\r\nimposing duties on imports, and for other purposes,\" I returned the same\r\nto the House with my objections to its becoming a law. These objections,\r\nwhich had entirely satisfied my own mind of the great impolicy, if not\r\nunconstitutionality, of the measure, were presented in the most\r\nrespectful and even deferential terms. I would not have been so far\r\nforgetful of what was due from one department of the Government to\r\nanother as to have intentionally employed in my official intercourse\r\nwith the House any language that could be in the slightest degree\r\noffensive to those to whom it was addressed. If in assigning my\r\nobjections to the bill I had so far forgotten what was due to the\r\nHouse of Representatives as to impugn its motives in passing the bill,\r\nI should owe, not only to that House, but to the country, the most\r\nprofound apology. Such departure from propriety is, however, not\r\ncomplained of in any proceeding which the House has adopted. It has,\r\non the contrary, been expressly made a subject of remark, and almost\r\nof complaint, that the language in which my dissent was couched was\r\nstudiously guarded and cautious.\r\n\r\nSuch being the character of the official communication in question,\r\nI confess I was wholly unprepared for the course which has been pursued\r\nin regard to it. In the exercise of its power to regulate its own\r\nproceedings the House for the first time, it is believed, in the history\r\nof the Government thought proper to refer the message to a select\r\ncommittee of its own body for the purpose, as my respect for the\r\nHouse would have compelled me to infer, of deliberately weighing the\r\nobjections urged against the bill by the Executive with a view to its\r\nown judgment upon the question of the final adoption or rejection of\r\nthe measure.\r\n\r\nOf the temper and feelings in relation to myself of some of the members\r\nselected for the performance of this duty I have nothing to say.\r\nThat was a matter entirely within the discretion of the House of\r\nRepresentatives. But that committee, taking a different view of its duty\r\nfrom that which I should have supposed had led to its creation, instead\r\nof confining itself to the objections urged against the bill availed\r\nitself of the occasion formally to arraign the motives of the President\r\nfor others of his acts since his induction into office. In the absence\r\nof all proof and, as I am bound to declare, against all law or precedent\r\nin parliamentary proceedings, and at the same time in a manner which\r\nit would be difficult to reconcile with the comity hitherto sacredly\r\nobserved in the intercourse between independent and coordinate\r\ndepartments of the Government, it has assailed my whole official conduct\r\nwithout the shadow of a pretext for such assault, and, stopping short\r\nof impeachment, has charged me, nevertheless, with offenses declared\r\nto deserve impeachment.\r\n\r\nHad the extraordinary report which the committee thus made to the\r\nHouse been permitted to remain without the sanction of the latter,\r\nI should not have uttered a regret or complaint upon the subject.\r\nBut unaccompanied as it is by any particle of testimony to support the\r\ncharges it contains, without a deliberate examination, almost without\r\nany discussion, the House of Representatives has been pleased to adopt\r\nit as its own, and thereby to become my accuser before the country and\r\nbefore the world. The high character of such an accuser, the gravity of\r\nthe charges which have been made, and the judgment pronounced against me\r\nby the adoption of the report upon a distinct and separate vote of the\r\nHouse leave me no alternative but to enter my solemn protest against\r\nthis proceeding as unjust to myself as a man, as an invasion of my\r\nconstitutional powers as Chief Magistrate of the American people, and as\r\na violation in my person of rights secured to every citizen by the laws\r\nand the Constitution. That Constitution has intrusted to the House\r\nof Representatives the sole power of impeachment. Such impeachment\r\nis required to be tried before the most august tribunal known to\r\nour institutions. The Senate of the United States, composed of the\r\nrepresentatives of the sovereignty of the States, is converted into a\r\nhall of justice, and in order to insure the strictest observance of the\r\nrules of evidence and of legal procedure the Chief Justice of the United\r\nStates, the highest judicial functionary of the land, is required to\r\npreside over its deliberations. In the presence of such a judicatory the\r\nvoice of faction is presumed to be silent, and the sentence of guilt or\r\ninnocence is pronounced under the most solemn sanctions of religion, of\r\nhonor, and of law. To such a tribunal does the Constitution authorize\r\nthe House of Representatives to carry up its accusations against any\r\nchief of the executive department whom it may believe to be guilty of\r\nhigh crimes and misdemeanors. Before that tribunal the accused is\r\nconfronted with his accusers, and may demand the privilege, which the\r\njustice of the common law secures to the humblest citizen, of a full,\r\npatient, and impartial inquiry into the facts, upon the testimony of\r\nwitnesses rigidly cross-examined and deposing in the face of day.\r\nIf such a proceeding had been adopted toward me, unjust as I should\r\ncertainly have regarded it, I should, I trust, have met with a becoming\r\nconstancy a trial as painful as it would have been undeserved. I would\r\nhave manifested by a profound submission to the laws of my country my\r\nperfect faith in her justice, and, relying on the purity of my motives\r\nand the rectitude of my conduct, should have looked forward with\r\nconfidence to a triumphant refutation in the presence of that country\r\nand by the solemn judgment of such a tribunal not only of whatever\r\ncharges might have been formally preferred against me, but of all the\r\ncalumnies of which I have hitherto been the unresisting victim. As\r\nit is, I have been accused without evidence and condemned without a\r\nhearing. As far as such proceedings can accomplish it, I am deprived of\r\npublic confidence in the administration of the Government and denied\r\neven the boast of a good name--a name transmitted to me from a patriot\r\nfather, prized as my proudest inheritance, and carefully preserved for\r\nthose who are to come after me as the most precious of all earthly\r\npossessions. I am not only subjected to imputations affecting my\r\ncharacter as an individual, but am charged with offenses against the\r\ncountry so grave and so heinous as to deserve public disgrace and\r\ndisfranchisement. I am charged with violating pledges which I never\r\ngave, and, because I execute what I believe to be the law, with usurping\r\npowers not conferred by law, and, above all, with using the powers\r\nconferred upon the President by the Constitution from corrupt motives\r\nand for unwarrantable ends. And these charges are made without any\r\nparticle of evidence to sustain them, and, as I solemnly affirm,\r\nwithout any foundation in truth.\r\n\r\nWhy is a proceeding of this sort adopted at this time? Is the occasion\r\nfor it found in the fact that having been elected to the second office\r\nunder the Constitution by the free and voluntary suffrages of the\r\npeople, I have succeeded to the first according to the express\r\nprovisions of the fundamental law of the same people? It is true that\r\nthe succession of the Vice-President to the Chief Magistracy has never\r\noccurred before and that all prudent and patriotic minds have looked\r\non this new trial of the wisdom and stability of our institutions with\r\na somewhat anxious concern. I have been made to feel too sensibly\r\nthe difficulties of my unprecedented position not to know all that is\r\nintended to be conveyed in the reproach cast upon a President without\r\na party. But I found myself placed in this most responsible station\r\nby no usurpation or contrivance of my own. I was called to it, under\r\nProvidence, by the supreme law of the land and the deliberately declared\r\nwill of the people. It is by these that I have been clothed with the\r\nhigh powers which they have seen fit to confide to their Chief Executive\r\nand been charged with the solemn responsibility under which those powers\r\nare to be exercised. It is to them that I hold myself answerable as a\r\nmoral agent for a free and conscientious discharge of the duties which\r\nthey have imposed upon me. It is not as an individual merely that I am\r\nnow called upon to resist the encroachments of unconstitutional power.\r\nI represent the executive authority of the people of the United States,\r\nand it is in their name, whose mere agent and servant I am, and whose\r\nwill declared in their fundamental law I dare not, even were I inclined,\r\nto disobey, that I protest against every attempt to break down the\r\nundoubted constitutional power of this department without a solemn\r\namendment of that fundamental law.\r\n\r\nI am determined to uphold the Constitution in this as in other\r\nrespects to the utmost of my ability and in defiance of all personal\r\nconsequences. What may happen to an individual is of little importance,\r\nbut the Constitution of the country, or any one of its great and clear\r\nprinciples and provisions, is too sacred to be surrendered under any\r\ncircumstances whatever by those who are charged with its protection and\r\ndefense. Least of all should he be held guiltless who, placed at the\r\nhead of one of the great departments of the Government, should shrink\r\nfrom the exercise of its unquestionable authority on the most important\r\noccasions and should consent without a struggle to efface all the\r\nbarriers so carefully erected by the people to control and circumscribe\r\nthe powers confided to their various agents. It may be desirable, as the\r\nmajority of the House of Representatives has declared it is, that no\r\nsuch checks upon the will of the Legislature should be suffered to\r\ncontinue. This is a matter for the people and States to decide, but\r\nuntil they shall have decided it I shall feel myself bound to execute,\r\nwithout fear or favor, the law as it has been written by our\r\npredecessors.\r\n\r\nI protest against this whole proceeding of the House of Representatives\r\nas _ex parte_ and extrajudicial. I protest against it as subversive of\r\nthe common right of all citizens to be condemned only upon a fair and\r\nimpartial trial, according to law and evidence, before the country.\r\nI protest against it as destructive of all the comity of intercourse\r\nbetween the departments of this Government, and destined sooner or\r\nlater to lead to conflicts fatal to the peace of the country and the\r\nintegrity of the Constitution. I protest against it in the name of that\r\nConstitution which is not only my own shield of protection and defense,\r\nbut that of every American citizen. I protest against it in the name of\r\nthe people, by whose will I stand where I do, by whose authority I\r\nexercised the power which I am charged with having usurped, and to whom\r\nI am responsible for a firm and faithful discharge according to my own\r\nconvictions of duty of the high stewardship confided to me by them.\r\nI protest against it in the name of all regulated liberty and all\r\nlimited government as a proceeding tending to the utter destruction\r\nof the checks and balances of the Constitution and the accumulating\r\nin the hands of the House of Representatives, or a bare majority of\r\nCongress for the time being, an uncontrolled and despotic power. And\r\nI respectfully ask that this my protest may be entered upon the Journal\r\nof the House of Representatives as a solemn and formal declaration for\r\nall time to come against the injustice and unconstitutionality of such\r\na proceeding.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 6, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nWe have continued reason to express our profound gratitude to the Great\r\nCreator of All Things for numberless benefits conferred upon us as a\r\npeople. Blessed with genial seasons, the husbandman has his garners\r\nfilled with abundance, and the necessaries of life, not to speak of its\r\nluxuries, abound in every direction. While in some other nations steady\r\nand industrious labor can hardly find the means of subsistence, the\r\ngreatest evil which we have to encounter is a surplus of production\r\nbeyond the home demand, which seeks, and with difficulty finds, a\r\npartial market in other regions. The health of the country, with partial\r\nexceptions, has for the past year been well preserved, and under their\r\nfree and wise institutions the United States are rapidly advancing\r\ntoward the consummation of the high destiny which an overruling\r\nProvidence seems to have marked out for them. Exempt from domestic\r\nconvulsion and at peace with all the world, we are left free to consult\r\nas to the best means of securing and advancing the happiness of the\r\npeople. Such are the circumstances under which you now assemble in your\r\nrespective chambers and which should lead us to unite in praise and\r\nthanksgiving to that great Being who made us and who preserves us as\r\na nation.\r\n\r\nI congratulate you, fellow-citizens, on the happy change in the aspect\r\nof our foreign affairs since my last annual message. Causes of complaint\r\nat that time existed between the United States and Great Britain which,\r\nattended by irritating circumstances, threatened most seriously the\r\npublic peace. The difficulty of adjusting amicably the questions at\r\nissue between the two countries was in no small degree augmented by the\r\nlapse of time since they had their origin. The opinions entertained by\r\nthe Executive on several of the leading topics in dispute were frankly\r\nset forth in the message at the opening of your late session. The\r\nappointment of a special minister by Great Britain to the United States\r\nwith power to negotiate upon most of the points of difference indicated\r\na desire on her part amicably to adjust them, and that minister was met\r\nby the Executive in the same spirit which had dictated his mission.\r\nThe treaty consequent thereon having been duly ratified by the two\r\nGovernments, a copy, together with the correspondence which accompanied\r\nit, is herewith communicated. I trust that whilst you may see in it\r\nnothing objectionable, it may be the means of preserving for an\r\nindefinite period the amicable relations happily existing between the\r\ntwo Governments. The question of peace or war between the United States\r\nand Great Britain is a question of the deepest interest, not only to\r\nthemselves, but to the civilized world, since it is scarcely possible\r\nthat a war could exist between them without endangering the peace of\r\nChristendom. The immediate effect of the treaty upon ourselves will be\r\nfelt in the security afforded to mercantile enterprise, which, no longer\r\napprehensive of interruption, adventures its speculations in the most\r\ndistant seas, and, freighted with the diversified productions of every\r\nland, returns to bless our own. There is nothing in the treaty which in\r\nthe slightest degree compromits the honor or dignity of either nation.\r\nNext to the settlement of the boundary line, which must always be a\r\nmatter of difficulty between states as between individuals, the question\r\nwhich seemed to threaten the greatest embarrassment was that connected\r\nwith the African slave trade.\r\n\r\nBy the tenth article of the treaty of Ghent it was expressly declared\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n\r\n  Whereas the traffic in slaves is irreconcilable with the principles\r\n  of humanity and justice, and whereas both His Majesty and the United\r\n  States are desirous of continuing their efforts to promote its entire\r\n  abolition, it is hereby agreed that both the contracting parties\r\n  shall use their best endeavors to accomplish so desirable an object.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the enforcement of the laws and treaty stipulations of Great Britain\r\na practice had threatened to grow up on the part of its cruisers of\r\nsubjecting to visitation ships sailing under the American flag, which,\r\nwhile it seriously involved our maritime rights, would subject to\r\nvexation a branch of our trade which was daily increasing, and which\r\nrequired the fostering care of Government. And although Lord Aberdeen\r\nin his correspondence with the American envoys at London expressly\r\ndisclaimed all right to detain an American ship on the high seas, even\r\nif found with a cargo of slaves on board, and restricted the British\r\npretension to a mere claim to visit and inquire, yet it could not well\r\nbe discerned by the Executive of the United States how such visit and\r\ninquiry could be made without detention on the voyage and consequent\r\ninterruption to the trade. It was regarded as the right of search\r\npresented only in a new form and expressed in different words, and\r\nI therefore felt it to be my duty distinctly to declare in my annual\r\nmessage to Congress that no such concession could be made, and that the\r\nUnited States had both the will and the ability to enforce their own\r\nlaws and to protect their flag from being used for purposes wholly\r\nforbidden by those laws and obnoxious to the moral censure of the world.\r\nTaking the message as his letter of instructions, our then minister at\r\nParis felt himself required to assume the same ground in a remonstrance\r\nwhich he felt it to be his duty to present to Mr. Guizôt, and through\r\nhim to the King of the French, against what has been called the\r\n\"quintuple treaty;\" and his conduct in this respect met with the\r\napproval of this Government. In close conformity with these views the\r\neighth article of the treaty was framed, which provides \"that each\r\nnation shall keep afloat in the African seas a force not less than\r\n80 guns, to act separately and apart, under instructions from their\r\nrespective Governments, and for the enforcement of their respective laws\r\nand obligations.\" From this it will be seen that the ground assumed\r\nin the message has been fully maintained at the same time that the\r\nstipulations of the treaty of Ghent are to be carried out in good faith\r\nby the two countries, and that all pretense is removed for interference\r\nwith our commerce for any purpose whatever by a foreign government.\r\nWhile, therefore, the United States have been standing up for the\r\nfreedom of the seas, they have not thought proper to make that a pretext\r\nfor avoiding a fulfillment of their treaty stipulations or a ground\r\nfor giving countenance to a trade reprobated by our laws. A similar\r\narrangement by the other great powers could not fail to sweep from the\r\nocean the slave trade without the interpolation of any new principle\r\ninto the maritime code. We may be permitted to hope that the example\r\nthus set will be followed by some if not all of them. We thereby also\r\nafford suitable protection to the fair trader in those seas, thus\r\nfulfilling at the same time the dictates of a sound policy and complying\r\nwith the claims of justice and humanity.\r\n\r\nIt would have furnished additional cause for congratulation if the\r\ntreaty could have embraced all subjects calculated in future to lead to\r\na misunderstanding between the two Governments. The Territory of the\r\nUnited States commonly called the Oregon Territory, lying on the Pacific\r\nOcean north of the forty-second degree of latitude, to a portion of\r\nwhich Great Britain lays claim, begins to attract the attention of our\r\nfellow-citizens, and the tide of population which has reclaimed what was\r\nso lately an unbroken wilderness in more contiguous regions is preparing\r\nto flow over those vast districts which stretch from the Rocky Mountains\r\nto the Pacific Ocean. In advance of the acquirement of individual rights\r\nto these lands, sound policy dictates that every effort should be\r\nresorted to by the two Governments to settle their respective claims.\r\nIt became manifest at an early hour of the late negotiations that any\r\nattempt for the time being satisfactorily to determine those rights\r\nwould lead to a protracted discussion, which might embrace in its\r\nfailure other more pressing matters, and the Executive did not regard\r\nit as proper to waive all the advantages of an honorable adjustment of\r\nother difficulties of great magnitude and importance because this, not\r\nso immediately pressing, stood in the way. Although the difficulty\r\nreferred to may not for several years to come involve the peace of\r\nthe two countries, yet I shall not delay to urge on Great Britain the\r\nimportance of its early settlement. Nor will other matters of commercial\r\nimportance to the two countries be overlooked, and I have good reason to\r\nbelieve that it will comport with the policy of England, as it does with\r\nthat of the United States, to seize upon this moment, when most of the\r\ncauses of irritation have passed away, to cement the peace and amity of\r\nthe two countries by wisely removing all grounds of probable future\r\ncollision.\r\n\r\nWith the other powers of Europe our relations continue on the most\r\namicable footing. Treaties now existing with them should be rigidly\r\nobserved, and every opportunity compatible with the interests of the\r\nUnited States should be seized upon to enlarge the basis of commercial\r\nintercourse. Peace with all the world is the true foundation of our\r\npolicy, which can only be rendered permanent by the practice of equal\r\nand impartial justice to all. Our great desire should be to enter only\r\ninto that rivalry which looks to the general good in the cultivation\r\nof the sciences, the enlargement of the field for the exercise of the\r\nmechanical arts, and the spread of commerce--that great civilizer--to\r\nevery land and sea. Carefully abstaining from interference in all\r\nquestions exclusively referring themselves to the political interests\r\nof Europe, we may be permitted to hope an equal exemption from the\r\ninterference of European Governments in what relates to the States\r\nof the American continent.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of April last the commissioners on the part of the United\r\nStates under the convention with the Mexican Republic of the 11th of\r\nApril, 1839, made to the proper Department a final report in relation to\r\nthe proceedings of the commission. From this it appears that the total\r\namount awarded to the claimants by the commissioners and the umpire\r\nappointed under that convention was $2,026,079.68. The arbiter having\r\nconsidered that his functions were required by the convention to\r\nterminate at the same time with those of the commissioners, returned to\r\nthe board, undecided for want of time, claims which had been allowed by\r\nthe American commissioners to the amount of $928,620.88. Other claims,\r\nin which the amount sought to be recovered was $3,336,837.05, were\r\nsubmitted to the board too late for its consideration. The minister of\r\nthe United States at Mexico has been duly authorized to make demand for\r\npayment of the awards according to the terms of the convention and the\r\nprovisions of the act of Congress of the 12th of June, 1840. He has also\r\nbeen instructed to communicate to that Government the expectations of\r\nthe Government of the United States in relation to those claims which\r\nwere not disposed of according to the provisions of the convention,\r\nand all others of citizens of the United States against the Mexican\r\nGovernment. He has also been furnished with other instructions, to be\r\nfollowed by him in case the Government of Mexico should not find itself\r\nin a condition to make present payment of the amount of the awards in\r\nspecie or its equivalent.\r\n\r\nI am happy to be able to say that information which is esteemed\r\nfavorable both to a just satisfaction of the awards and a reasonable\r\nprovision for other claims has been recently received from Mr. Thompson,\r\nthe minister of the United States, who has promptly and efficiently\r\nexecuted the instructions of his Government in regard to this important\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of the United States who accompanied the late Texan\r\nexpedition to Santa Fe, and who were wrongfully taken and held as\r\nprisoners of war in Mexico, have all been liberated.\r\n\r\nA correspondence has taken place between the Department of State and\r\nthe Mexican minister of foreign affairs upon the complaint of Mexico\r\nthat citizens of the United States were permitted to give aid to the\r\ninhabitants of Texas in the war existing between her and that Republic.\r\nCopies of this correspondence are herewith communicated to Congress,\r\ntogether with copies of letters on the same subject addressed to the\r\ndiplomatic corps at Mexico by the American minister and the Mexican\r\nsecretary of state.\r\n\r\nMexico has thought proper to reciprocate the mission of the United\r\nStates to that Government by accrediting to this a minister of the same\r\nrank as that of the representative of the United States in Mexico. From\r\nthe circumstances connected with his mission favorable results are\r\nanticipated from it. It is so obviously for the interest of both\r\ncountries as neighbors and friends that all just causes of mutual\r\ndissatisfaction should be removed that it is to be hoped neither will\r\nomit or delay the employment of any practicable and honorable means to\r\naccomplish that end.\r\n\r\nThe affairs pending between this Government and several others of the\r\nStates of this hemisphere formerly under the dominion of Spain have\r\nagain within the past year been materially obstructed by the military\r\nrevolutions and conflicts in those countries.\r\n\r\nThe ratifications of the treaty between the United States and the\r\nRepublic of Ecuador of the 13th of June, 1839, have been exchanged,\r\nand that instrument has been duly promulgated on the part of this\r\nGovernment. Copies are now communicated to Congress with a view to\r\nenable that body to make such changes in the laws applicable to our\r\nintercourse with that Republic as may be deemed requisite.\r\n\r\nProvision has been made by the Government of Chile for the payment of\r\nthe claim on account of the illegal detention of the brig _Warrior_ at\r\nCoquimbo in 1820. This Government has reason to expect that other claims\r\nof our citizens against Chile will be hastened to a final and\r\nsatisfactory close.\r\n\r\nThe Empire of Brazil has not been altogether exempt from those\r\nconvulsions which so constantly afflict the neighboring republics.\r\nDisturbances which recently broke out are, however, now understood to\r\nbe quieted. But these occurrences, by threatening the stability of the\r\ngovernments, or by causing incessant and violent changes in them or in\r\nthe persons who administer them, tend greatly to retard provisions for a\r\njust indemnity for losses and injuries suffered by individual subjects\r\nor citizens of other states. The Government of the United States will\r\nfeel it to be its duty, however, to consent to no delay not unavoidable\r\nin making satisfaction for wrongs and injuries sustained by its own\r\ncitizens. Many years having in some cases elapsed, a decisive and\r\neffectual course of proceeding will be demanded of the respective\r\ngovernments against whom claims have been preferred.\r\n\r\nThe vexatious, harassing, and expensive war which so long prevailed with\r\nthe Indian tribes inhabiting the peninsula of Florida has happily been\r\nterminated, whereby our Army has been relieved from a service of the\r\nmost disagreeable character and the Treasury from a large expenditure.\r\nSome casual outbreaks may occur, such as are incident to the close\r\nproximity of border settlers and the Indians, but these, as in all other\r\ncases, may be left to the care of the local authorities, aided when\r\noccasion may require by the forces of the United States. A sufficient\r\nnumber of troops will be maintained in Florida so long as the remotest\r\napprehensions of danger shall exist, yet their duties will be limited\r\nrather to the garrisoning of the necessary posts than to the maintenance\r\nof active hostilities. It is to be hoped that a territory so long\r\nretarded in its growth will now speedily recover from the evils incident\r\nto a protracted war, exhibiting in the increased amount of its rich\r\nproductions true evidences of returning wealth and prosperity. By the\r\npractice of rigid justice toward the numerous Indian tribes residing\r\nwithin our territorial limits and the exercise of a parental vigilance\r\nover their interests, protecting them against fraud and intrusion, and\r\nat the same time using every proper expedient to introduce among them\r\nthe arts of civilized life, we may fondly hope not only to wean them\r\nfrom their love of war, but to inspire them with a love for peace and\r\nall its avocations. With several of the tribes great progress in\r\ncivilizing them has already been made. The schoolmaster and the\r\nmissionary are found side by side, and the remnants of what were once\r\nnumerous and powerful nations may yet be preserved as the builders up\r\nof a new name for themselves and their posterity.\r\n\r\nThe balance in the Treasury on the 1st of January, 1842, exclusive of\r\nthe amount deposited with the States, trust funds, and indemnities, was\r\n$230,483.68. The receipts into the Treasury during the three first\r\nquarters of the present year from all sources amount to $26,616,593.78,\r\nof which more than fourteen millions were received from customs and\r\nabout one million from the public lands. The receipts for the fourth\r\nquarter are estimated at nearly eight millions, of which four millions\r\nare expected from customs and three millions and a half from loans and\r\nTreasury notes. The expenditures of the first three quarters of the\r\npresent year exceed twenty-six millions, and those estimated for the\r\nfourth quarter amount to about eight millions; and it is anticipated\r\nthere will be a deficiency of half a million on the 1st of January next,\r\nbut that the amount of outstanding warrants (estimated at $800,000) will\r\nleave an actual balance of about $224,000 in the Treasury. Among the\r\nexpenditures of this year are more than eight millions for the public\r\ndebt and about $600,000 on account of the distribution to the States of\r\nthe proceeds of sales of the public lands.\r\n\r\nThe present tariff of duties was somewhat hastily and hurriedly passed\r\nnear the close of the late session of Congress. That it should have\r\ndefects can therefore be surprising to no one. To remedy such defects as\r\nmay be found to exist in any of its numerous provisions will not fail\r\nto claim your serious attention. It may well merit inquiry whether the\r\nexaction of all duties in cash does not call for the introduction of a\r\nsystem which has proved highly beneficial in countries where it has been\r\nadopted. I refer to the warehousing system. The first and most prominent\r\neffect which it would produce would be to protect the market alike\r\nagainst redundant or deficient supplies of foreign fabrics, both of\r\nwhich in the long run are injurious as well to the manufacturer as the\r\nimporter. The quantity of goods in store being at all times readily\r\nknown, it would enable the importer with an approach to accuracy to\r\nascertain the actual wants of the market and to regulate himself\r\naccordingly. If, however, he should fall into error by importing an\r\nexcess above the public wants, he could readily correct its evils by\r\navailing himself of the benefits and advantages of the system thus\r\nestablished. In the storehouse the goods imported would await the demand\r\nof the market and their issues would be governed by the fixed principles\r\nof demand and supply. Thus an approximation would be made to a\r\nsteadiness and uniformity of price, which if attainable would conduce\r\nto the decided advantage of mercantile and mechanical operations.\r\n\r\nThe apprehension may be well entertained that without something to\r\nameliorate the rigor of cash payments the entire import trade may fall\r\ninto the hands of a few wealthy capitalists in this country and in\r\nEurope. The small importer, who requires all the money he can raise for\r\ninvestments abroad, and who can but ill afford to pay the lowest duty,\r\nwould have to subduct in advance a portion of his funds in order to pay\r\nthe duties, and would lose the interest upon the amount thus paid for\r\nall the time the goods might remain unsold, which might absorb his\r\nprofits. The rich capitalist, abroad as well as at home, would thus\r\npossess after a short time an almost exclusive monopoly of the import\r\ntrade, and laws designed for the benefit of all would thus operate for\r\nthe benefit of a few--a result wholly uncongenial with the spirit of our\r\ninstitutions and antirepublican in all its tendencies. The warehousing\r\nsystem would enable the importer to watch the market and to select his\r\nown time for offering his goods for sale. A profitable portion of the\r\ncarrying trade in articles entered for the benefit of drawback must also\r\nbe most seriously affected without the adoption of some expedient to\r\nrelieve the cash system. The warehousing system would afford that\r\nrelief, since the carrier would have a safe recourse to the public\r\nstorehouses and might without advancing the duty reship within some\r\nreasonable period to foreign ports. A further effect of the measure\r\nwould be to supersede the system of drawbacks, thereby effectually\r\nprotecting the Government against fraud, as the right of debenture would\r\nnot attach to goods after their withdrawal from the public stores.\r\n\r\nIn revising the existing tariff of duties, should you deem it proper to\r\ndo so at your present session, I can only repeat the suggestions and\r\nrecommendations which upon several occacions I have heretofore felt it\r\nto be my duty to offer to Congress. The great primary and controlling\r\ninterest of the American people is union--union not only in the mere\r\nforms of government, forms which may be broken, but union founded in\r\nan attachment of States and individuals for each other. This union in\r\nsentiment and feeling can only be preserved by the adoption of that\r\ncourse of policy which, neither giving exclusive benefits to some nor\r\nimposing unnecessary burthens upon others, shall consult the interests\r\nof all by pursuing a course of moderation and thereby seeking to\r\nharmonize public opinion, and causing the people everywhere to feel and\r\nto know that the Government is careful of the interests of all alike.\r\nNor is there any subject in regard to which moderation, connected with a\r\nwise discrimination, is more necessary than in the imposition of duties\r\non imports. Whether reference be had to revenue, the primary object in\r\nthe imposition of taxes, or to the incidents which necessarily flow from\r\ntheir imposition, this is entirely true. Extravagant duties defeat their\r\nend and object, not only by exciting in the public mind an hostility to\r\nthe manufacturing interests, but by inducing a system of smuggling on\r\nan extensive scale and the practice of every manner of fraud upon the\r\nrevenue, which the utmost vigilance of Government can not effectually\r\nsuppress. An opposite course of policy would be attended by results\r\nessentially different, of which every interest of society, and none more\r\nthan those of the manufacturer, would reap important advantages. Among\r\nthe most striking of its benefits would be that derived from the general\r\nacquiescence of the country in its support and the consequent permanency\r\nand stability which would be given to all the operations of industry. It\r\ncan not be too often repeated that no system of legislation can be wise\r\nwhich is fluctuating and uncertain. No interest can thrive under it.\r\nThe prudent capitalist will never adventure his capital in manufacturing\r\nestablishments, or in any other leading pursuit of life, if there\r\nexists a state of uncertainty as to whether the Government will repeal\r\nto-morrow what it has enacted to-day. Fitful profits, however high, if\r\nthreatened with a ruinous reduction by a vacillating policy on the part\r\nof Government, will scarcely tempt him to trust the money which he has\r\nacquired by a life of labor upon the uncertain adventure. I therefore,\r\nin the spirit of conciliation, and influenced by no other desire than to\r\nrescue the great interests of the country from the vortex of political\r\ncontention, and in the discharge of the high and solemn duties of the\r\nplace which I now occupy, recommend moderate duties, imposed with a\r\nwise discrimination as to their several objects, as being not only\r\nmost likely to be durable, but most advantageous to every interest\r\nof society.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the War Department exhibits a very\r\nfull and satisfactory account of the various and important interests\r\ncommitted to the charge of that officer. It is particularly gratifying\r\nto find that the expenditures for the military service are greatly\r\nreduced in amount--that a strict system of economy has been introduced\r\ninto the service and the abuses of past years greatly reformed. The\r\nfortifications on our maritime frontier have been prosecuted with much\r\nvigor, and at many points our defenses are in a very considerable state\r\nof forwardness. The suggestions in reference to the establishment of\r\nmeans of communication with our territories on the Pacific and to the\r\nsurveys so essential to a knowledge of the resources of the intermediate\r\ncountry are entitled to the most favorable consideration. While I would\r\npropose nothing inconsistent with friendly negotiations to settle the\r\nextent of our claims in that region, yet a prudent forecast points out\r\nthe necessity of such measures as may enable us to maintain our rights.\r\nThe arrangements made for preserving our neutral relations on the\r\nboundary between us and Texas and keeping in check the Indians in that\r\nquarter will be maintained so long as circumstances may require. For\r\nseveral years angry contentions have grown out of the disposition\r\ndirected by law to be made of the mineral lands held by the Government\r\nin several of the States. The Government is constituted the landlord,\r\nand the citizens of the States wherein lie the lands are its tenants.\r\nThe relation is an unwise one, and it would be much more conducive of\r\nthe public interest that a sale of the lands should be made than that\r\nthey should remain in their present condition. The supply of the ore\r\nwould be more abundantly and certainly furnished when to be drawn from\r\nthe enterprise and the industry of the proprietor than under the present\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations of the Secretary in regard to the improvements of\r\nthe Western waters and certain prominent harbors on the Lakes merit, and\r\nI doubt not will receive, your serious attention. The great importance\r\nof these subjects to the prosperity of the extensive region referred\r\nto and the security of the whole country in time of war can not escape\r\nobservation. The losses of life and property which annually occur\r\nin the navigation of the Mississippi alone because of the dangerous\r\nobstructions in the river make a loud demand upon Congress for the\r\nadoption of efficient measures for their removal.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy will bring you acquainted with\r\nthat important branch of the public defenses. Considering the already\r\nvast and daily increasing commerce of the country, apart from the\r\nexposure to hostile inroad of an extended seaboard, all that relates to\r\nthe Navy is calculated to excite particular attention. Whatever tends\r\nto add to its efficiency without entailing unnecessary charges upon\r\nthe Treasury is well worthy of your serious consideration. It will be\r\nseen that while an appropriation exceeding by more than a million the\r\nappropriations of the current year is asked by the Secretary, yet that\r\nin this sum is proposed to be included $400,000 for the purchase of\r\nclothing, which when once expended will be annually reimbursed by the\r\nsale of the clothes, and will thus constitute a perpetual fund without\r\nany new appropriation to the same object. To this may also be added\r\n$50,000 asked to cover the arrearages of past years and $250,000 in\r\norder to maintain a competent squadron on the coast of Africa; all of\r\nwhich when deducted will reduce the expenditures nearly within the\r\nlimits of those of the current year. While, however, the expenditures\r\nwill thus remain very nearly the same as of the antecedent year, it is\r\nproposed to add greatly to the operations of the marine, and in lieu of\r\nonly 25 ships in commission and but little in the way of building, to\r\nkeep with the same expenditure 41 vessels afloat and to build 12 ships\r\nof a small class.\r\n\r\nA strict system of accountability is established and great pains are\r\ntaken to insure industry, fidelity, and economy in every department of\r\nduty. Experiments have been instituted to test the quality of various\r\nmaterials, particularly copper, iron, and coal, so as to prevent fraud\r\nand imposition.\r\n\r\nIt will appear by the report of the Postmaster-General that the great\r\npoint which for several years has been so much desired has during the\r\ncurrent year been fully accomplished. The expenditures of the Department\r\nfor current service have been brought within its income without\r\nlessening its general usefulness. There has been an increase of revenue\r\nequal to $166,000 for the year 1842 over that of 1841, without, as it\r\nis believed, any addition having been made to the number of letters and\r\nnewspapers transmitted through the mails. The post-office laws have been\r\nhonestly administered, and fidelity has been observed in accounting for\r\nand paying over by the subordinates of the Department the moneys which\r\nhave been received. For the details of the service I refer you to the\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nI flatter myself that the exhibition thus made of the condition of the\r\npublic administration will serve to convince you that every proper\r\nattention has been paid to the interests of the country by those who\r\nhave been called to the heads of the different Departments. The\r\nreduction in the annual expenditures of the Government already\r\naccomplished furnishes a sure evidence that economy in the application\r\nof the public moneys is regarded as a paramount duty.\r\n\r\nAt peace with all the world, the personal liberty of the citizen\r\nsacredly maintained and his rights secured under political institutions\r\nderiving all their authority from the direct sanction of the people,\r\nwith a soil fertile almost beyond example and a country blessed with\r\nevery diversity of climate and production, what remains to be done in\r\norder to advance the happiness and prosperity of such a people? Under\r\nordinary circumstances this inquiry could readily be answered. The best\r\nthat probably could be done for a people inhabiting such a country would\r\nbe to fortify their peace and security in the prosecution of their\r\nvarious pursuits by guarding them against invasion from without and\r\nviolence from within. The rest for the greater part might be left to\r\ntheir own energy and enterprise. The chief embarrassments which at the\r\nmoment exhibit themselves have arisen from overaction, and the most\r\ndifficult task which remains to be accomplished is that of correcting\r\nand overcoming its effects. Between the years 1833 and 1838 additions\r\nwere made to bank capital and bank issues, in the form of notes designed\r\nfor circulation, to an extent enormously great. The question seemed to\r\nbe not how the best currency could be provided, but in what manner the\r\ngreatest amount of bank paper could be put in circulation. Thus a vast\r\namount of what was called money--since for the time being it answered\r\nthe purposes of money--was thrown upon the country, an overissue which\r\nwas attended, as a necessary consequence, by an extravagant increase of\r\nthe prices of all articles of property, the spread of a speculative\r\nmania all over the country, and has finally ended in a general\r\nindebtedness on the part of States and individuals, the prostration of\r\npublic and private credit, a depreciation in the market value of real\r\nand personal estate, and has left large districts of country almost\r\nentirely without any circulating medium. In view of the fact that in\r\n1830 the whole banknote circulation within the United States amounted\r\nto but $61,323,898, according to the Treasury statements, and that an\r\naddition had been made thereto of the enormous sum of $88,000,000 in\r\nseven years (the circulation on the 1st of January, 1837, being stated\r\nat $149,185,890), aided by the great facilities afforded in obtaining\r\nloans from European capitalists, who were seized with the same\r\nspeculative _mania_ which prevailed in the United States, and the large\r\nimportations of funds from abroad--the result of stock sales and\r\nloans--no one can be surprised at the apparent but unsubstantial\r\nstate of prosperity which everywhere prevailed over the land; and as\r\nlittle cause of surprise should be felt at the present prostration\r\nof everything and the ruin which has befallen so many of our\r\nfellow-citizens in the sudden withdrawal from circulation of so large an\r\namount of bank issues since 1837--exceeding, as is believed, the amount\r\nadded to the paper currency for a similar period antecedent to 1837--it\r\nceases to be a matter of astonishment that such extensive shipwreck\r\nshould have been made of private fortunes or that difficulties should\r\nexist in meeting their engagements on the part of the debtor States;\r\napart from which, if there be taken into account the immense losses\r\nsustained in the dishonor of numerous banks, it is less a matter of\r\nsurprise that insolvency should have visited many of our fellow-citizens\r\nthan that so many should have escaped the blighting influences of the\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nIn the solemn conviction of these truths and with an ardent desire to\r\nmeet the pressing necessities of the country, I felt it to be my duty to\r\ncause to be submitted to you at the commencement of your last session\r\nthe plan of an exchequer, the whole power and duty of maintaining which\r\nin purity and vigor was to be exercised by the representatives of the\r\npeople and the States, and therefore virtually by the people themselves.\r\nIt was proposed to place it under the control and direction of a\r\nTreasury board to consist of three commissioners, whose duty it should\r\nbe to see that the law of its creation was faithfully executed and that\r\nthe great end of supplying a paper medium of exchange at all times\r\nconvertible into gold and silver should be attained. The board thus\r\nconstituted was given as much permanency as could be imparted to it\r\nwithout endangering the proper share of responsibility which should\r\nattach to all public agents. In order to insure all the advantages of a\r\nwell-matured experience, the commissioners were to hold their offices\r\nfor the respective periods of two, four, and six years, thereby securing\r\nat all times in the management of the exchequer the services of two men\r\nof experience; and to place them in a condition to exercise perfect\r\nindependence of mind and action it was provided that their removal\r\nshould only take place for actual incapacity or infidelity to the trust,\r\nand to be followed by the President with an exposition of the causes of\r\nsuch removal, should it occur. It was proposed to establish subordinate\r\nboards in each of the States, under the same restrictions and\r\nlimitations of the power of removal, which, with the central board,\r\nshould receive, safely keep, and disburse the public moneys. And in\r\norder to furnish a sound paper medium of exchange the exchequer should\r\nretain of the revenues of the Government a sum not to exceed $5,000,000\r\nin specie, to be set apart as required by its operations, and to pay the\r\npublic creditor at his own option either in specie or Treasury notes of\r\ndenominations not less than $5 nor exceeding $100, which notes should\r\nbe redeemed at the several places of issue, and to be receivable at all\r\ntimes and everywhere in payment of Government dues, with a restraint\r\nupon such issue of bills that the same should not exceed the _maximum_\r\nof $15,000,000. In order to guard against all the hazards incident to\r\nfluctuations in trade, the Secretary of the Treasury was invested with\r\nauthority to issue $5,000,000 of Government stock, should the same at\r\nany time be regarded as necessary in order to place beyond hazard the\r\nprompt redemption of the bills which might be thrown into circulation;\r\nthus in fact making the issue of $15,000,000 of exchequer bills rest\r\nsubstantially on $10,000,000, and keeping in circulation never more than\r\none and one-half dollars for every dollar in specie. When to this it is\r\nadded that the bills are not only everywhere receivable in Government\r\ndues, but that the Government itself would be bound for their ultimate\r\nredemption, no rational doubt can exist that the paper which the\r\nexchequer would furnish would readily enter into general circulation and\r\nbe maintained at all times at or above par with gold and silver, thereby\r\nrealizing the great want of the age and fulfilling the wishes of the\r\npeople. In order to reimburse the Government the expenses of the plan,\r\nit was proposed to invest the exchequer with the limited authority to\r\ndeal in bills of exchange (unless prohibited by the State in which an\r\nagency might be situated) having only thirty days to run and resting on\r\na fair and _bona fide_ basis. The legislative will on this point might\r\nbe so plainly announced as to avoid all pretext for partiality or\r\nfavoritism. It was furthermore proposed to invest this Treasury agent\r\nwith authority to receive on deposit to a limited amount the specie\r\nfunds of individuals and to grant certificates therefor to be redeemed\r\non presentation, under the idea, which is believed to be well founded,\r\nthat such certificates would come in aid of the exchequer bills in\r\nsupplying a safe and ample paper circulation. Or if in place of the\r\ncontemplated dealings in exchange the exchequer should be authorized\r\nnot only to exchange its bills for actual deposits of specie, but, for\r\nspecie or its equivalent, to sell drafts, charging therefor a small but\r\nreasonable premium, I can not doubt but that the benefits of the law\r\nwould be speedily manifested in the revival of the credit, trade, and\r\nbusiness of the whole country. Entertaining this opinion, it becomes my\r\nduty to urge its adoption upon Congress by reference to the strongest\r\nconsiderations of the public interests, with such alterations in its\r\ndetails as Congress may in its wisdom see fit to make.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that this proposed alteration and amendment of the laws\r\nestablishing the Treasury Department has encountered various objections,\r\nand that among others it has been proclaimed a Government bank of\r\nfearful and dangerous import. It is proposed to confer upon it no\r\nextraordinary power. It purports to do no more than pay the debts of the\r\nGovernment with the redeemable paper of the Government, in which respect\r\nit accomplishes precisely what the Treasury does daily at this time in\r\nissuing to the public creditors the Treasury notes which under law it is\r\nauthorized to issue. It has no resemblance to an ordinary bank, as it\r\nfurnishes no profits to private stockholders and lends no capital to\r\nindividuals. If it be objected to as a Government bank and the objection\r\nbe available, then should all the laws in relation to the Treasury be\r\nrepealed and the capacity of the Government to collect what is due to\r\nit or pay what it owes be abrogated.\r\n\r\nThis is the chief purpose of the proposed exchequer, and surely if\r\nin the accomplishment of a purpose so essential it affords a sound\r\ncirculating medium to the country and facilities to trade it should be\r\nregarded as no slight recommendation of it to public consideration.\r\nProperly guarded by the provisions of law, it can run into no dangerous\r\nevil, nor can any abuse arise under it but such as the Legislature\r\nitself will be answerable for if it be tolerated, since it is but the\r\ncreature of the law and is susceptible at all times of modification,\r\namendment, or repeal at the pleasure of Congress. I know that it has\r\nbeen objected that the system would be liable to be abused by the\r\nLegislature, by whom alone it could be abused, in the party conflicts of\r\nthe day; that such abuse would manifest itself in a change of the law\r\nwhich would authorize an excessive issue of paper for the purpose of\r\ninflating prices and winning popular favor. To that it may be answered\r\nthat the ascription of such a motive to Congress is altogether\r\ngratuitous and inadmissible. The theory of our institutions would\r\nlead us to a different conclusion. But a perfect security against\r\na proceeding so reckless would be found to exist in the very nature\r\nof things. The political party which should be so blind to the true\r\ninterests of the country as to resort to such an expedient would\r\ninevitably meet with final overthrow in the fact that the moment the\r\npaper ceased to be convertible into specie or otherwise promptly\r\nredeemed it would become worthless, and would in the end dishonor the\r\nGovernment, involve the people in ruin and such political party in\r\nhopeless disgrace. At the same time, such a view involves the utter\r\nimpossibility of furnishing any currency other than that of the precious\r\nmetals; for if the Government itself can not forego the temptation of\r\nexcessive paper issues what reliance can be placed in corporations upon\r\nwhom the temptations of individual aggrandizement would most strongly\r\noperate? The people would have to blame none but themselves for any\r\ninjury that might arise from a course so reckless, since their agents\r\nwould be the wrongdoers and they the passive spectators.\r\n\r\nThere can be but three kinds of public currency--first, gold and silver;\r\nsecond, the paper of State institutions; or, third, a representative of\r\nthe precious metals provided by the General Government or under its\r\nauthority. The subtreasury system rejected the last in any form, and as\r\nit was believed that no reliance could be placed on the issues of local\r\ninstitutions for the purposes of general circulation it necessarily and\r\nunavoidably adopted specie as the exclusive currency for its own use;\r\nand this must ever be the case unless one of the other kinds be used.\r\nThe choice in the present state of public sentiment lies between an\r\nexclusive specie currency on the one hand and Government issues of some\r\nkind on the other. That these issues can not be made by a chartered\r\ninstitution is supposed to be conclusively settled. They must be made,\r\nthen, directly by Government agents. For several years past they have\r\nbeen thus made in the form of Treasury notes, and have answered a\r\nvaluable purpose. Their usefulness has been limited by their being\r\ntransient and temporary; their ceasing to bear interest at given periods\r\nnecessarily causes their speedy return and thus restricts their range of\r\ncirculation, and being used only in the disbursements of Government they\r\ncan not reach those points where they are most required. By rendering\r\ntheir use permanent, to the moderate extent already mentioned, by\r\noffering no inducement for their return and by exchanging them for coin\r\nand other values, they will constitute to a certain extent the general\r\ncurrency so much needed to maintain the internal trade of the country.\r\nAnd this is the exchequer plan so far as it may operate in furnishing\r\na currency.\r\n\r\nI can not forego the occasion to urge its importance to the credit of\r\nthe Government in a financial point of view. The great necessity of\r\nresorting to every proper and becoming expedient in order to place the\r\nTreasury on a footing of the highest respectability is entirely obvious.\r\nThe credit of the Government may be regarded as the very soul of the\r\nGovernment itself--a principle of vitality without which all its\r\nmovements are languid and all its operations embarrassed. In this spirit\r\nthe Executive felt itself bound by the most imperative sense of duty\r\nto submit to Congress at its last session the propriety of making a\r\nspecific pledge of the land fund as the basis for the negotiation of\r\nthe loans authorized to be contracted. I then thought that such an\r\napplication of the public domain would without doubt have placed at the\r\ncommand of the Government ample funds to relieve the Treasury from the\r\ntemporary embarrassments under which it labored. American credit has\r\nsuffered a considerable shock in Europe from the large indebtedness\r\nof the States and the temporary inability of some of them to meet the\r\ninterest on their debts. The utter and disastrous prostration of the\r\nUnited States Bank of Pennsylvania had contributed largely to increase\r\nthe sentiment of distrust by reason of the loss and ruin sustained by\r\nthe holders of its stock, a large portion of whom were foreigners and\r\nmany of whom were alike ignorant of our political organization and of\r\nour actual responsibilities.\r\n\r\nIt was the anxious desire of the Executive that in the effort to\r\nnegotiate the loan abroad the American negotiator might be able to\r\npoint the money lender to the fund mortgaged for the redemption of\r\nthe principal and interest of any loan he might contract, and thereby\r\nvindicate the Government from all suspicion of bad faith or inability to\r\nmeet its engagements. Congress differed from the Executive in this view\r\nof the subject. It became, nevertheless, the duty of the Executive to\r\nresort to every expedient in its power to do so.\r\n\r\nAfter a failure in the American market a citizen of high character\r\nand talent was sent to Europe, with no better success; and thus the\r\nmortifying spectacle has been presented of the inability of this\r\nGovernment to obtain a loan so small as not in the whole to amount to\r\nmore than one-fourth of its ordinary annual income, at a time when the\r\nGovernments of Europe, although involved in debt and with their subjects\r\nheavily burthened with taxation, readily obtained loans of any amount\r\nat a greatly reduced rate of interest. It would be unprofitable to look\r\nfurther into this anomalous state of things, but I can not conclude\r\nwithout adding that for a Government which has paid off its debts of\r\ntwo wars with the largest maritime power of Europe, and now owing a\r\ndebt which is almost next to nothing when compared with its boundless\r\nresources--a Government the strongest in the world, because emanating\r\nfrom the popular will and firmly rooted in the affections of a great\r\nand free people, and whose fidelity to its engagements has never been\r\nquestioned--for such a Government to have tendered to the capitalists of\r\nother countries an opportunity for a small investment in its stock, and\r\nyet to have failed, implies either the most unfounded distrust in its\r\ngood faith or a purpose to obtain which the course pursued is the most\r\nfatal which could have been adopted. It has now become obvious to all\r\nmen that the Government must look to its own means for supplying its\r\nwants, and it is consoling to know that these means are altogether\r\nadequate for the object. The exchequer, if adopted, will greatly aid\r\nin bringing about this result. Upon what I regard as a well-founded\r\nsupposition that its bills would be readily sought for by the public\r\ncreditors and that the issue would in a short time reach the maximum of\r\n$15,000,000, it is obvious that $10,000,000 would thereby be added to\r\nthe available means of the Treasury without cost or charge. Nor can I\r\nfail to urge the great and beneficial effects which would be produced in\r\naid of all the active pursuits of life. Its effects upon the solvent\r\nState banks, while it would force into liquidation those of an opposite\r\ncharacter through its weekly settlements, would be highly beneficial;\r\nand with the advantages of a sound currency the restoration of\r\nconfidence and credit would follow with a numerous train of blessings.\r\nMy convictions are most strong that these benefits would flow from the\r\nadoption of this measure; but if the result should be adverse there is\r\nthis security in connection with it--that the law creating it may be\r\nrepealed at the pleasure of the Legislature without the slightest\r\nimplication of its good faith.\r\n\r\nI recommend to Congress to take into consideration the propriety of\r\nreimbursing a fine imposed on General Jackson at New Orleans at the\r\ntime of the attack and defense of that city, and paid by him. Without\r\ndesigning any reflection on the judicial tribunal which imposed the\r\nfine, the remission at this day may be regarded as not unjust or\r\ninexpedient. The voice of the civil authority was heard amidst the\r\nglitter of arms and obeyed by those who held the sword, thereby giving\r\nadditional luster to a memorable military achievement. If the laws were\r\noffended, their majesty was fully vindicated; and although the penalty\r\nincurred and paid is worthy of little regard in a pecuniary point of\r\nview, it can hardly be doubted that it would be gratifying to the\r\nwar-worn veteran, now in retirement and in the winter of his days, to be\r\nrelieved from the circumstances in which that judgment placed him. There\r\nare cases in which public functionaries may be called on to weigh the\r\npublic interest against their own personal hazards, and if the civil law\r\nbe violated from praiseworthy motives or an overruling sense of public\r\ndanger and public necessity punishment may well be restrained within\r\nthat limit which asserts and maintains the authority of the law and\r\nthe subjection of the military to the civil power. The defense of New\r\nOrleans, while it saved a city from the hands of the enemy, placed the\r\nname of General Jackson among those of the greatest captains of the age\r\nand illustrated one of the brightest pages of our history. Now that the\r\ncauses of excitement existing at the time have ceased to operate, it is\r\nbelieved that the remission of this fine and whatever of gratification\r\nthat remission might cause the eminent man who incurred and paid it\r\nwould be in accordance with the general feeling and wishes of the\r\nAmerican people.\r\n\r\nI have thus, fellow-citizens, acquitted myself of my duty under the\r\nConstitution by laying before you as succinctly as I have been able the\r\nstate of the Union and by inviting your attention to measures of much\r\nimportance to the country. The executive will most zealously unite its\r\nefforts with those of the legislative department in the accomplishment\r\nof all that is required to relieve the wants of a common constituency\r\nor elevate the destinies of a beloved country.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _December 13, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI hereby communicate to the Senate a letter from the Secretary of the\r\nNavy, with accompanying documents.[80]\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: Communication from Commodore Charles W.

The number of vessels of all sorts and the amount of\r\nproperty owned by citizens of the United States which are found in those\r\nislands in the course of the year are stated probably with sufficient\r\naccuracy in the letter of the agents.\r\n\r\nJust emerging from a state of barbarism, the Government of the islands\r\nis as yet feeble, but its dispositions appear to be just and pacific,\r\nand it seems anxious to improve the condition of its people by the\r\nintroduction of knowledge, of religious and moral institutions, means\r\nof education, and the arts of civilized life.\r\n\r\nIt can not but be in conformity with the interest and wishes of the\r\nGovernment and the people of the United States that this community, thus\r\nexisting in the midst of a vast expanse of ocean, should be respected\r\nand all its rights strictly and conscientiously regarded; and this must\r\nalso be the true interest of all other commercial states. Far remote\r\nfrom the dominions of European powers, its growth and prosperity as an\r\nindependent state may yet be in a high degree useful to all whose trade\r\nis extended to those regions; while its near approach to this continent\r\nand the intercourse which American vessels have with it, such vessels\r\nconstituting five-sixths of all which annually visit it, could not but\r\ncreate dissatisfaction on the part of the United States at any attempt\r\nby another power, should such attempt be threatened or feared, to take\r\npossession of the islands, colonize them, and subvert the native\r\nGovernment. Considering, therefore, that the United States possesses so\r\nlarge a share of the intercourse with those islands, it is deemed not\r\nunfit to make the declaration that their Government seeks, nevertheless,\r\nno peculiar advantages, no exclusive control over the Hawaiian\r\nGovernment, but is content with its independent existence and anxiously\r\nwishes for its security and prosperity. Its forbearance in this respect\r\nunder the circumstances of the very large intercourse of their citizens\r\nwith the islands would justify this Government, should events hereafter\r\narise to require it, in making a decided remonstrance against the\r\nadoption of an opposite policy by any other power. Under the\r\ncircumstances I recommend to Congress to provide for a moderate\r\nallowance to be made out of the Treasury to the consul residing there,\r\nthat in a Government so new and a country so remote American citizens\r\nmay have respectable authority to which to apply for redress in case of\r\ninjury to their persons and property, and to whom the Government of the\r\ncountry may also make known any acts committed by American citizens of\r\nwhich it may think it has a right to complain.\r\n\r\nEvents of considerable importance have recently transpired in China.\r\nThe military operations carried on against that Empire by the English\r\nGovernment have been terminated by a treaty, according to the terms of\r\nwhich four important ports hitherto shut against foreign commerce are\r\nto be open to British merchants, viz, Amoy, Foo-Choo-Foo, Ningpo, and\r\nChinghai. It can not but be interesting to the mercantile interest of\r\nthe United States, whose intercourse with China at the single port\r\nof Canton has already become so considerable, to ascertain whether\r\nthese other ports now open to British commerce are to remain shut,\r\nnevertheless, against the commerce of the United States. The treaty\r\nbetween the Chinese Government and the British commissioner provides\r\nneither for the admission nor the exclusion of the ships of other\r\nnations. It would seem, therefore, that it remains with every other\r\nnation having commercial intercourse with China to seek to make proper\r\narrangements for itself with the Government of that Empire in this\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nThe importations into the United States from China are known to be\r\nlarge, having amounted in some years, as will be seen by the annexed\r\ntables, to $9,000,000. The exports, too, from the United States to\r\nChina constitute an interesting and growing part of the commerce of the\r\ncountry. It appears that in the year 1841, in the direct trade between\r\nthe two countries, the value of the exports from the United States\r\namounted to $715,000 in domestic produce and $485,000 in foreign\r\nmerchandise. But the whole amount of American produce which finally\r\nreaches China and is there consumed is not comprised in these tables,\r\nwhich show only the direct trade. Many vessels with American products on\r\nboard sail with a primary destination to other countries, but ultimately\r\ndispose of more or less of their cargoes in the port of Canton.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarities of the Chinese Government and the Chinese character\r\nare well known. An Empire supposed to contain 300,000,000 subjects,\r\nfertile in various rich products of the earth, not without the knowledge\r\nof letters and of many arts, and with large and expensive accommodations\r\nfor internal intercourse and traffic, has for ages sought to exclude the\r\nvisits of strangers and foreigners from its dominions, and has assumed\r\nfor itself a superiority over all other nations. Events appear likely to\r\nbreak down and soften this spirit of nonintercourse and to bring China\r\nere long into the relations which usually subsist between civilized\r\nstates. She has agreed in the treaty with England that correspondence\r\nbetween the agents of the two Governments shall be on equal terms--a\r\nconcession which it is hardly probable will hereafter be withheld from\r\nother nations.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the cheapness of labor among the Chinese, their\r\ningenuity in its application, and the fixed character of their habits\r\nand pursuits may discourage the hope of the opening of any great and\r\nsudden demand for the fabrics of other countries. But experience proves\r\nthat the productions of western nations find a market to some extent\r\namong the Chinese; that that market, so far as respects the productions\r\nof the United States, although it has considerably varied in successive\r\nseasons, has on the whole more than doubled within the last ten years;\r\nand it can hardly be doubted that the opening of several new and\r\nimportant ports connected with parts of the Empire heretofore seldom\r\nvisited by Europeans or Americans would exercise a favorable influence\r\nupon the demand for such productions.\r\n\r\nIt is not understood that the immediate establishment of correspondent\r\nembassies and missions or the permanent residence of diplomatic\r\nfunctionaries with full powers of each country at the Court of the other\r\nis contemplated between England and China, although, as has been already\r\nobserved, it has been stipulated that intercourse between the two\r\ncountries shall hereafter be on equal terms. An ambassador or envoy\r\nextraordinary and minister plenipotentiary can only be accredited,\r\naccording to the usages of western nations, to the head or sovereign of\r\nthe state, and it may be doubtful whether the Court of Pekin is yet\r\nprepared to conform to these usages so far as to receive a minister\r\nplenipotentiary to reside near it.\r\n\r\nBeing of opinion, however, that the commercial interests of the United\r\nStates connected with China require at the present moment a degree of\r\nattention and vigilance such as there is no agent of this Government\r\non the spot to bestow, I recommend to Congress to make appropriation\r\nfor the compensation of a commissioner to reside in China to exercise\r\na watchful care over the concerns of American citizens and for the\r\nprotection of their persons and property, empowered to hold intercourse\r\nwith the local authorities, and ready, under instructions from his\r\nGovernment, should such instructions become necessary and proper\r\nhereafter, to address himself to the high functionaries of the Empire,\r\nor through them to the Emperor himself.\r\n\r\nIt will not escape the observation of Congress that in order to secure\r\nthe important object of any such measure a citizen of much intelligence\r\nand weight of character should be employed on such agency, and that to\r\nsecure the services of such an individual a compensation should be made\r\ncorresponding with the magnitude and importance of the mission.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 31, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with your resolution of the 12th of February, 1841,\r\nrequesting me to communicate to the House of Representatives the\r\ndocuments and other information in the possession of the Executive\r\nregarding claims of citizens of the United States on the Government\r\nof Hayti, I now transmit a letter from the Secretary of State and the\r\naccompanying documents.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 9, 1843_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have received a resolution of the Senate of the 27th of December, in\r\nthe following terms:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the President be requested to inform the Senate, if\r\n  compatible with the public interest, whether the quintuple treaty\r\n  for the suppression of the slave trade has been communicated to the\r\n  Government of the United States in any form whatever, and, if so, by\r\n  whom, for what purpose, and what answer may have been returned to such\r\n  communication. Also to communicate to the Senate all the information\r\n  which may have been received by the Government of the United States\r\n  going to show that the \"_course which this Government might take in\r\n  relation to said treaty has excited no small degree of attention and\r\n  discussion in Europe_.\" Also to inform the Senate how far the \"_warm\r\n  animadversions_\" and the \"_great political excitement\"_ which this\r\n  treaty has caused in Europe have any application or reference to the\r\n  United States. Also to inform the Senate what danger there was that\r\n  \"_the laws and the obligations_\" of the United States in relation to\r\n  the suppression of the slave trade would be \"_executed by others_,\" if\r\n  we did not \"_remove the pretext and motive for violating our flag and\r\n  executing our laws_\" by entering into the stipulations for the African\r\n  squadron and the remonstrating embassies which are contained in the\r\n  eighth and ninth articles of the late British treaty. Also that the\r\n  President be requested to communicate to the Senate all the\r\n  correspondence with our ministers abroad relating to the foregoing\r\n  points of inquiry. Also that the President be requested to communicate\r\n  to the Senate all such information upon the negotiation of the African\r\n  squadron articles as will show the origin of such articles and the\r\n  history and progress of their formation.\r\n\r\n\r\nI informed the Senate, in the message transmitting the treaty with\r\nEngland of the 9th of August last, that no application or request had\r\nbeen made to this Government to become a party to the quintuple treaty.\r\nAgents of the Government abroad, regarding the signature of that treaty\r\nas a political occurrence of some importance, obtained, unofficially,\r\ncopies of it, and transmitted those copies to the Department of State,\r\nas other intelligence is communicated for the information of the\r\nGovernment. The treaty has not been communicated to the Government of\r\nthe United States from any other quarter, in any other manner, or for\r\nany other purpose.\r\n\r\nThe next request expressed in the resolution is in these words:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Also to communicate to the Senate all the information which may have\r\n  been received by the Government of the United States going to show that\r\n  the \"course which this Government might take in relation to said treaty\r\n  has excited no small degree of attention and discussion in Europe.\" Also\r\n  to inform the Senate how far the \"warm animadversions\" and the \"great\r\n  political excitement\" which this treaty has caused in Europe have any\r\n  application or reference to the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe words quoted in this part of the resolution appear to be taken from\r\nmy message above mentioned. In that communication I said:\r\n\r\n\r\n  No application or request has been made to this Government to become\r\n  a party to this treaty, but the course it might take in regard to it\r\n  has excited no small degree of attention and discussion in Europe, as\r\n  the principle upon which it is founded and the stipulations which it\r\n  contains have caused warm animadversions and great political\r\n  excitement.\r\n\r\n  In my message at the commencement of the present session of Congress\r\n  I endeavored to state the principles which this Government supports\r\n  respecting the right of search and the immunity of flags. Desirous of\r\n  maintaining those principles fully, at the same time that existing\r\n  obligations should be fulfilled, I have thought it most consistent\r\n  with the honor and dignity of the country that it should execute its\r\n  own laws and perform its own obligations by its own means and its own\r\n  power. The examination or visitation of the merchant vessels of one\r\n  nation by the cruisers of another for any purposes except those known\r\n  and acknowledged by the law of nations, under whatever restraints or\r\n  regulations it may take place, may lead to dangerous results. It is\r\n  far better by other means to supersede any supposed necessity or any\r\n  motive for such examination or visit. Interference with a merchant\r\n  vessel by an armed cruiser is always a delicate proceeding, apt to\r\n  touch the point of national honor as well as to affect the interests\r\n  of individuals. It has been thought, therefore, expedient, not only in\r\n  accordance with the stipulations of the treaty of Ghent, but at the\r\n  same time as removing all pretext on the part of others for violating\r\n  the immunities of the American flag upon the seas as they exist and\r\n  are defined by the law of nations, to enter into the articles now\r\n  submitted to the Senate.\r\n\r\n  The treaty which I now submit to you proposes no alteration, mitigation,\r\n  or modification of the rules of the law of nations. It provides simply\r\n  that each of the two Governments shall maintain on the coast of Africa a\r\n  sufficient squadron to enforce, separately and respectively, the laws,\r\n  rights, and obligations of the two countries for the suppression of the\r\n  slave trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese opinions were expressed by me officially upon the occasion of\r\nmaking to the Senate a communication of very great importance. It is not\r\nperceived how the accuracy of this general statement can be doubted by\r\nthose who are acquainted with the debates of public bodies in Europe,\r\nthe productions of the press, and the other modes by which public\r\nopinion is manifested in an enlightened age. It is not to be supposed\r\nthat excited attention to public and national transactions or general\r\npolitical discussions in Europe on subjects open to all the world are\r\nknown only in consequence of private information communicated to the\r\nGovernment, and feeling a strong persuasion that it would be improper in\r\nthe Executive to go into any discussion or argument upon such a subject\r\nwith the Senate, I have no further remarks to make upon this part of the\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nThe third inquiry is:\r\n\r\n\r\n  What danger there was that \"the laws and the obligations\" of the United\r\n  States in relation to the suppression of the slave trade would be\r\n  \"executed by others\" if we do not \"remove the pretext and motive for\r\n  violating our flag and executing our laws.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already quoted from the message the entire paragraph to a part of\r\nwhich this portion of the inquiry is supposed to refer.\r\n\r\nAs to the danger there was that the laws and the obligations of the\r\nUnited States in relation to the suppression of the slave trade would\r\nbe executed by others if we did not remove the pretext and motive for\r\nviolating our flag and provide for executing our laws, I might say that\r\nthis depends upon notorious facts and occurrences, of which the evidence\r\nhas been in various forms before the country and all the branches of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to occupy the Executive chair I could not be ignorant\r\nof the numerous complaints which had been made on account of alleged\r\ninterruptions of American vessels engaged in lawful commerce on the\r\ncoast of Africa by British cruisers on the ground of their being engaged\r\nin the slave trade. I could not be ignorant, at the same time, of the\r\nwell-grounded suspicions which pervaded the country that some American\r\nvessels were engaged in that odious and unlawful traffic. There were two\r\ndangers, then, to be guarded against--the one, that this traffic would\r\ncontinue to be carried on in American ships, and perhaps much increased,\r\nunless some new and vigorous effort should be made for its suppression;\r\nthe other, that acquiescence in the capture of American vessels,\r\nnotorious slave dealers, by British cruisers might give countenance to\r\nseizures and detentions of vessels lawfully employed on light or\r\ngroundless suspicions. And cases had arisen under the administration of\r\nthose who preceded me well calculated to show the extent and magnitude\r\nof this latter danger; and believing that very serious consequences\r\nmight in time grow out of the obvious tendency and progress of things,\r\nI felt it to be my duty to arrest that progress, to rescue the immunity\r\nof the American flag from the danger which hung over it, and to do this\r\nby recommending such a provision for the execution of our own laws as\r\nshould remove all pretense for the interference of others.\r\n\r\nAmong the occurrences to which I have alluded, it may be useful to\r\nparticularize one case.\r\n\r\nThe schooner _Catharine_, an American vessel owned by citizens of the\r\nUnited States, was seized on the coast of Africa by the British cruiser\r\ncalled the _Dolphin_ and brought into the port of New York in the summer\r\nof 1839. Upon being brought into port, Benjamin F. Butler, esq.,\r\ndistrict attorney of the United States for the southern district of\r\nNew York, appeared in the district court of the United States for that\r\ndistrict and in the name and behalf of the United States libeled the\r\nschooner, her apparel and furniture, for a violation of the several acts\r\nof Congress passed for the suppression of the slave trade. The schooner\r\nbeing arrested by the usual process in such cases and possession taken\r\nof her from the hands of the British captors by officers of the United\r\nStates, the cause proceeded, and by a decree of the circuit court in\r\nDecember, 1840, a forfeiture was pronounced. From this decree an appeal\r\nwas taken, which is now pending in the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in another case, that of the _Tigris_, of like general\r\ncharacter, soon after arising, the then Secretary of State, on the 1st\r\nof March, 1841, informed Mr. Fox, the British minister, that \"however\r\nstrong and unchangeable may be the determination of this Government to\r\npunish any citizens of the United States who violate the laws against\r\nthe African slave trade, it will not permit the exercise of any\r\nauthority by foreign armed vessels in the execution of those laws.\"\r\n\r\nBut it is evident that this general declaration did not relieve the\r\nsubject from its difficulties. Vessels of the United States found\r\nengaged in the African slave trade are guilty of piracy under the acts\r\nof Congress. It is difficult to say that such vessels can claim any\r\ninterference of the Government in their behalf, into whosesoever hands\r\nthey may happen to fall, any more than vessels which should turn general\r\npirates. Notorious African slave traders can not claim the protection of\r\nthe American character, inasmuch as they are acting in direct violation\r\nof the laws of their country and stand denounced by those laws as\r\npirates. In case of the seizure of such a vessel by a foreign cruiser,\r\nand of her being brought into a port of the United States, what is to\r\nbe done with her? Shall she be libeled, prosecuted, and condemned as if\r\narrested by a cruiser of the United States? If this is to be done, it\r\nis clear that the agency of a foreign power has been instrumental in\r\nexecuting the laws of the United States. Or, on the other hand, is the\r\nvessel, with all her offenses flagrant upon her, to be released on\r\naccount of the agency by which she was seized, discharged of all\r\npenalties, and left at liberty to renew her illegal and nefarious\r\ntraffic?\r\n\r\nIt appeared to me that the best, if not the only, mode of avoiding these\r\nand other difficulties was by adopting such a provision as is contained\r\nin the late treaty with England.\r\n\r\nThe Senate asks me for the reasons for entering into the stipulations\r\nfor the \"remonstrating embassies\" contained in the late treaty. Surely\r\nthere is no stipulation in the treaty for any \"remonstrating embassies,\"\r\nor any other embassies, nor any reference or allusion to any such thing.\r\nIn this respect all that the treaty provides is in the ninth article and\r\nis in these words:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The parties to this treaty agree that they will unite in all becoming\r\n  representations and remonstrances with any and all powers within whose\r\n  dominions such markets [for African slaves] are allowed to exist, and\r\n  that they will urge upon all such powers the propriety and duty of\r\n  closing such markets effectually, at once and forever.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt always gives me sincere pleasure to communicate to both Houses of\r\nCongress anything in my power which may aid them in the discharge of\r\ntheir high duties and which the public interest does not require to\r\nbe withheld. In transmitting the late treaty to the Senate everything\r\nwas caused to accompany it which it was supposed could enlighten the\r\njudgment of the Senate upon its various provisions. The views of the\r\nExecutive, in agreeing to the eighth and ninth articles, were fully\r\nexpressed, and pending the discussion in the Senate every call for\r\nfurther information was promptly complied with, and nothing kept back\r\nwhich the Senate desired. Upon this information and upon its own\r\nknowledge of the subject the Senate made up and pronounced its judgment\r\nupon its own high responsibility, and as the result of that judgment the\r\ntreaty was ratified, as the Journal shows, by a vote of 39 to 9. The\r\ntreaty has thus become the law of the land by the express advice of the\r\nSenate, given in the most solemn manner known to its proceedings. The\r\nfourth request is--\r\n\r\n\r\n  That the President be requested to communicate to the Senate all the\r\n  correspondence with our ministers abroad relating to the foregoing\r\n  points of inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this branch of the resolution were more definite, some parts of\r\nit might perhaps be met without prejudice to the public interest\r\nby extracts from the correspondence referred to. At a future day a\r\ncommunication may be expected to be made as broad and general as a\r\nproper regard to these interests will admit, but at present I deem any\r\nsuch communication not to be consistent with the public interest.\r\n\r\nThe fifth and last is--\r\n\r\n\r\n  That the President be requested to communicate to the Senate all such\r\n  information upon the negotiation of the African squadron articles as\r\n  will show the origin of such articles and the history and progress of\r\n  their formation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese articles were proposed to the British minister by the Secretary\r\nof State under my express sanction and were acceded to by him and have\r\nsince been ratified by both Governments. I might without disrespect\r\nspeak of the novelty of inquiring by the Senate into the history and\r\nprogress of articles of a treaty through a negotiation which has\r\nterminated, and as the result of which these articles have become the\r\nlaw of the land by the constitutional advice of the Senate itself. But\r\nI repeat that those articles had their origin in a desire on the part of\r\nthe Government of the United States to fulfill its obligations, entered\r\ninto by the treaty of Ghent, to do its utmost for the suppression of\r\nthe African slave trade, and to accomplish this object by such means as\r\nshould not lead to the interruption of the lawful commerce of the United\r\nStates or any derogation from the dignity and immunity of their flag.\r\nAnd I have the satisfaction to believe that both the Executive, in\r\nnegotiating the treaty of which these articles form part, and the\r\nSenate, in advising to its ratification, have effected an object\r\nimportant to the Government and satisfactory to the people.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I hope I may be permitted to observe that I have, out of a\r\nprofound respect for the Senate, been induced to make this communication\r\nin answer to inquiries some of which at least are believed to be without\r\nprecedent in the history of the relations between that body and the\r\nexecutive department. These inquiries were particularly unexpected to\r\nme at the present moment. As I had been so fortunate as to find my own\r\nviews of the expediency of ratifying the late treaty with England\r\nconfirmed by a vote of somewhat more than four-fifths of the Senators\r\npresent, I have hitherto flattered myself that the motives which\r\ninfluenced my conduct had been fully appreciated by those who advised\r\nand approved it, and that if a necessity should ever arise for any\r\nspecial explanation or defense in regard to those motives it could\r\nscarcely be in that assembly itself.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 18, 1843_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n27th ultimo, I now transmit the letter and pamphlet[84] which accompanies\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: Entitled \"Acts and Resolutions of the Legislative Council\r\nof the Territory of Florida,\" passed at its twentieth session, January\r\n3 to March 5, 1842.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 23, 1843_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the Senate, in answer to their resolution of the\r\n19th instant, reports[85] from the State and War Departments.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: Relating to a grant of land in Oregon Territory to the\r\nHudsons Bay Company by the British Government.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 23, 1843_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate herewith, in answer to their resolution of the\r\n5th instant, a report[86] from the Secretary of State, with accompanying\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: Transmitting correspondence with Great Britain relative to\r\nthe destruction of the steamboat _Caroline_ at Schlosser, N.Y., December\r\n29, 1837.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 31, 1843_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n24th instant, requesting me to communicate answers to certain queries\r\ntherein contained respecting instructions given to the commissioners\r\nappointed to adjudicate claims arising under the Cherokee treaty of\r\n1835, I transmit herewith a report from the War Department, accompanied\r\nby a copy of the instructions referred to.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 31, 1843_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAt the last session of Congress a resolution was passed by the House of\r\nRepresentatives requesting me to cause to be communicated to the House\r\n\"the several reports made to the Department of War by Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nHitchcock relative to the affairs of the Cherokee Indians, together with\r\nall information communicated by him concerning the frauds he was charged\r\nto investigate; also all facts in the possession of the Executive\r\nrelating to the subject.\"\r\n\r\nA resolution of the same import had been passed by the House of\r\nRepresentatives on the 18th of May last, requiring the Secretary of\r\nWar to communicate to the House the same reports and matters. After\r\nconsultation with me and under my directions, the Secretary of War\r\ninformed the House that the reports referred to relative to the affairs\r\nof the Cherokees contained information and suggestions in reference\r\nto the matters which it was supposed would become the subject of a\r\nnegotiation between that Department and the delegates of the Cherokee\r\nNation. It was stated by him that the nature and subject of the report,\r\nin the opinion of the President and the Department, rendered its\r\npublication at that time inconsistent with the public interest. The\r\nnegotiation referred to subsequently took place, and embraced the\r\nmatters upon which Lieutenant-Colonel Hitchcock had communicated his\r\nviews. That negotiation terminated without the conclusion of any\r\narrangement. It may, and in all probability will, be renewed. All the\r\ninformation communicated by Lieutenant-Colonel Hitchcock respecting the\r\nCherokees--their condition as a nation and their relations to other\r\ntribes--is herewith transmitted. But his suggestions and projects\r\nrespecting the anticipated propositions of the delegates and his views\r\nof their personal characters can not in any event aid the legislation of\r\nCongress, and in my opinion the promulgation of them would be unfair and\r\nunjust to him and inconsistent with the public interest, and they are\r\ntherefore not transmitted.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War further stated in his answer to the resolution that\r\nthe other report referred to in it, relating to the alleged frauds which\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Hitchcock was charged to investigate, contained such\r\ninformation as he (Colonel Hitchcock) was enabled to obtain by _ex\r\nparte_ inquiries of various persons whose statements were necessarily\r\nwithout the sanction of an oath, and which the persons implicated had\r\nhad no opportunity to contradict or explain. He expressed the opinion\r\nthat to promulgate those statements at that time would be grossly unjust\r\nto those persons and would be calculated to defeat rather than promote\r\nthe objects of the inquiry, and he remarked that sufficient opportunity\r\nhad not been given to the Department to pursue the investigation or to\r\ncall upon the parties affected for explanations or to determine on the\r\nmeasures proper to be adopted. And he hoped these reasons would be\r\nsatisfactory for not transmitting to the House at that time the reports\r\nreferred to in its resolution.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from the report of the Committee on Indian Affairs, to\r\nwhom the communication of the Secretary of War was referred, and which\r\nreport has been transmitted to me, together with the resolutions of the\r\nHouse adopted on the recommendation of the committee, and from those\r\nresolutions, that the reasons given by the Secretary were not deemed\r\nsatisfactory and that the House of Representatives claims the right to\r\ndemand from the Executive and heads of Departments such information as\r\nmaybe in their possession relating to \"subjects of the deliberations\r\nof the House and within the sphere of its legitimate powers,\" and that\r\nin the opinion of the House the reports and facts called for by its\r\nresolution of the 18th of May related to subjects of its deliberations\r\nand were within the sphere of its legitimate powers, and should have\r\nbeen communicated.\r\n\r\nIf by the assertion of this claim of right to call upon the Executive\r\nfor all the information in its possession relating to any subject of the\r\ndeliberation of the House, and within the sphere of its legitimate\r\npowers, it is intended to assert also that the Executive is bound to\r\ncomply with such call without the authority to exercise any discretion\r\non its part in reference to the nature of the information required or to\r\nthe interests of the country or of individuals to be affected by such\r\ncompliance, then do I feel bound, in the discharge of the high duty\r\nimposed upon me \"to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of\r\nthe United States,\" to declare in the most respectful manner my entire\r\ndissent from such a proposition. The instrument from which the several\r\ndepartments of the Government derive their authority makes each\r\nindependent of the other in the discharge of their respective functions.\r\nThe injunction of the Constitution that the President \"shall take care\r\nthat the laws be faithfully executed\" necessarily confers an authority\r\ncommensurate with the obligation imposed to inquire into the manner in\r\nwhich all public agents perform the duties assigned to them by law. To\r\nbe effective these inquiries must often be confidential. They may result\r\nin the collection of truth or of falsehood, or they may be incomplete\r\nand may require further prosecution. To maintain that the President\r\ncan exercise no discretion as to the time in which the matters thus\r\ncollected shall be promulgated or in respect to the character of\r\nthe information obtained would deprive him at once of the means of\r\nperforming one of the most salutary duties of his office. An inquiry\r\nmight be arrested at its first stage and the officers whose conduct\r\ndemanded investigation may be enabled to elude or defeat it. To require\r\nfrom the Executive the transfer of this discretion to a coordinate\r\nbranch of the Government is equivalent to the denial of its possession\r\nby him and would render him dependent upon that branch in the\r\nperformance of a duty purely executive.\r\n\r\nNor can it be a sound position that all papers, documents, and\r\ninformation of every description which may happen by any means to come\r\ninto the possession of the President or of the heads of Departments must\r\nnecessarily be subject to the call of the House of Representatives\r\n_merely_ because they relate to a subject of the deliberations of the\r\nHouse, although that subject may be within the sphere of its legitimate\r\npowers. It can not be that the only test is whether the information\r\nrelates to a legitimate subject of deliberation. The Executive\r\nDepartments and the citizens of this country have their rights and\r\nduties as well as the House of Representatives, and the maxim that the\r\nrights of one person or body are to be so exercised as not to impair\r\nthose of others is applicable in its fullest extent to this question.\r\nImpertinence or malignity may seek to make the Executive Departments the\r\nmeans of incalculable and irremediable injury to innocent parties by\r\nthrowing into them libels most foul and atrocious. Shall there be no\r\ndiscretionary authority permitted to refuse to become the instruments\r\nof such malevolence?\r\n\r\nAnd although information comes through a proper channel to an executive\r\nofficer it may often be of a character to forbid its being made public.\r\nThe officer charged with a confidential inquiry, and who reports its\r\nresult under the pledge of confidence which his appointment implies,\r\nought not to be exposed individually to the resentment of those whose\r\nconduct may be impugned by the information he collects. The knowledge\r\nthat such is to be the consequence will inevitably prevent the\r\nperformance of duties of that character, and thus the Government will\r\nbe deprived of an important means of investigating the conduct of its\r\nagents.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly no new doctrine in the halls of judicature or of\r\nlegislation that certain communications and papers are privileged, and\r\nthat the general authority to compel testimony must give way in certain\r\ncases to the paramount rights of individuals or of the Government. Thus\r\nno man can be compelled to accuse himself, to answer any question that\r\ntends to render him infamous, or to produce his own private papers\r\non any occasion. The communications of a client to his counsel and\r\nthe admissions made at the confessional in the course of religious\r\ndiscipline are privileged communications. In the courts of that country\r\nfrom which we derive our great principles of individual liberty and the\r\nrules of evidence it is well settled--and the doctrine has been fully\r\nrecognized in this country--that a minister of the Crown or the head of\r\na department can not be compelled to produce any papers or disclose any\r\ntransactions relating to the executive functions of the Government which\r\nhe declares are confidential or such as the public interest requires\r\nshould not be divulged; and the persons who have been the channels of\r\ncommunication to officers of the State are in like manner protected\r\nfrom the disclosure of their names. Other instances of privileged\r\ncommunications might be enumerated if it were deemed necessary. These\r\nprinciples are as applicable to evidence sought by a legislature as\r\nto that required by a court.\r\n\r\nThe practice of the Government since its foundation has sanctioned the\r\nprinciple that there must necessarily be a discretionary authority in\r\nreference to the nature of the information called for by either House\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nThe authority was claimed and exercised by General Washington in 1796.\r\nIn 1825 President Monroe declined compliance with a resolution of the\r\nHouse of Representatives calling for the correspondence between the\r\nExecutive Departments of this Government and the officers of the United\r\nStates Navy and others at or near the ports of South America on the\r\nPacific Ocean. In a communication made by the Secretary of War in 1832\r\nto the Committee of the House on the Public Lands, by direction of\r\nPresident Jackson, he denies the obligation of the Executive to furnish\r\nthe information called for and maintains the authority of the President\r\nto exercise a sound discretion in complying with calls of that\r\ndescription by the House of Representatives or its committees. Without\r\nmultiplying other instances, it is not deemed improper to refer to the\r\nrefusal of the President at the last session of the present Congress to\r\ncomply with a resolution of the House of Representatives calling for\r\nthe names of the members of Congress who had applied for offices. As no\r\nfurther notice was taken in any form of this refusal, it would seem to\r\nbe a fair inference that the House itself admitted that there were cases\r\nin which the President had a discretionary authority in respect to the\r\ntransmission of information in the possession of any of the Executive\r\nDepartments.\r\n\r\nApprehensive that silence under the claim supposed to be set up in the\r\nresolutions of the House of Representatives under consideration might be\r\nconstrued as an acquiescence in its soundness, I have deemed it due to\r\nthe great importance of the subject to state my views, that a compliance\r\nin part with the resolution may not be deemed a surrender of a necessary\r\nauthority of the Executive.\r\n\r\nMany of the reasons which existed at the date of the report of the\r\nSecretary of War of June 1, 1842, for then declining to transmit the\r\nreport of Lieutenant-Colonel Hitchcock concerning the frauds which he\r\nwas charged to investigate have ceased to operate. It has been found\r\nwholly impracticable to pursue the investigation in consequence of the\r\ndeath and removal out of the country of those who would be called upon\r\nto testify, and in consequence of the want of adequate authority or\r\nmeans to render it effectual. It could not be conducted without expense.\r\nCongress at its last session prohibited the payment of any account\r\nor charge whatever growing out of or in any way connected with any\r\ncommission or inquiry, except military and naval courts-martial and\r\ncourts of inquiry, unless special appropriations should be made for the\r\npayment of such accounts and charges. Of the policy of that provision of\r\nlaw it does not become me to speak, except to say that the institution\r\nof inquiries into the conduct of public agents, however urgent the\r\nnecessity for such inquiry may be, is thereby virtually denied to the\r\nExecutive, and that if evils of magnitude shall arise in consequence\r\nof the law I take to myself no portion of the responsibility.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the propriety of directing prosecutions against the\r\ncontractors to furnish Indians rations who are charged with improper\r\nconduct, a correspondence has been had between the War Department and\r\nthe Solicitor of the Treasury, which is herewith transmitted in a\r\nconviction that such prosecution would be entirely ineffectual.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I have thought proper to direct that\r\nthe report of Lieutenant-Colonel Hitchcock concerning the frauds\r\nwhich he was charged to investigate be transmitted to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and it accordingly accompanies this message. At\r\nthe same time, I have to request the House to consider it so far\r\nconfidential as not to direct its publication until the appropriate\r\ncommittee shall have examined it and expressed their opinion whether\r\na just regard to the character and rights of persons apparently\r\nimplicated, but who have not had an opportunity to meet the imputations\r\non them, does not require that portions at least of the report should\r\nnot at present be printed.\r\n\r\nThis course is adopted by me from a desire to render justice to all and\r\nat the same time avoid even the appearance of a desire to screen any,\r\nand also to prevent the exaggerated estimate of the importance of the\r\ninformation which is likely to be made from the mere fact of its being\r\nwithheld.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of the House also calls for \"all facts in the possession\r\nof the Executive, from any source, relating to the subject.\" There are\r\ntwo subjects specified in the resolution--one \"relative to the affairs\r\nof the Cherokee Indians,\" and another \"concerning the frauds he\r\n[Lieutenant-Colonel Hitchcock] was charged to investigate.\"\r\n\r\nAll the papers in the War Department or its bureaus relating to the\r\naffairs of the Cherokee Indians, it is believed, have been from time\r\nto time communicated to Congress and are contained in the printed\r\ndocuments, or are now transmitted, with the exception of those portions\r\nof Lieutenant-Colonel Hitchcock's report hereinbefore mentioned, and\r\nexcepting the correspondence with the Cherokee delegates in the\r\nnegotiations which took place during the last summer, which are not\r\nsupposed to be within the intent of the resolution of the House. For\r\nthe same reason a memorial from the Old Settlers, or Western Cherokees,\r\nas they term themselves, recently presented, is not transmitted. If\r\nthese or any other public documents should be desired by the House,\r\na specification of them will enable me to cause them to be furnished\r\nif it should be found proper.\r\n\r\nAll the papers in the War Office or its bureaus known or supposed to\r\nhave any relation to the alleged frauds which Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nHitchcock was charged to investigate are herewith transmitted.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 8, 1843_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives, in answer to their\r\nresolution of the 28th ultimo, a report[87] from the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: Stating that no information is in possession of the\r\nGovernment of any negotiation of a treaty, or of any overtures to treat,\r\nfor a cession of California by Mexico to England.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 9, 1843_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn order to enable Congress to approve or disapprove the selection of a\r\nsite for a Western armory made by the board of commissioners appointed\r\nby me for that purpose pursuant to the act of September 9, 1841, I\r\ntransmit herewith their report and proceedings, as required by that act.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 13, 1843_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives a report made to me\r\non the 9th instant by the Secretary of the Treasury, on the subject of\r\nthe present and prospective condition of the finances.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive from it that even if the receipts from the various\r\nsources of revenue for the current year shall prove not to have been\r\noverrated and the expenditures be restrained within the estimates, the\r\nTreasury will be exhausted before the close of the year, and that this\r\nwill be the case although authority should be given to the proper\r\nDepartment to reissue Treasury notes. But the state of facts existing at\r\nthe present moment can not fail to awaken a doubt whether the amount of\r\nthe revenue for the respective quarters of the year will come up to the\r\nestimates, nor is it entirely certain that the expenditures which will\r\nbe authorized by Congress may not exceed the aggregate sum which has\r\nhitherto been assumed as the basis of the Treasury calculations.\r\n\r\nOf all the duties of the Government, none is more sacred and imperative\r\nthan that of making adequate and ample provision for fulfilling with\r\npunctuality its pecuniary engagements and maintaining the public credit\r\ninviolate. Any failure in this respect not produced by unforeseen causes\r\ncould only be regarded by our common constituents as a serious neglect\r\nof the public interests. I feel it, therefore, to be an indispensable\r\nobligation, while so much of the session yet remains unexpired as to\r\nenable Congress to give to the subject the consideration which its\r\ngreat importance demands, most earnestly to call its attention to\r\nthe propriety of making further provision for the public service of\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\nThe proper objects of taxation are peculiarly within the discretion of\r\nthe Legislature, while it is the duty of the Executive to keep Congress\r\nduly advised of the state of the Treasury and to admonish it of any\r\ndanger which there may be ground to apprehend of a failure in the means\r\nof meeting the expenditures authorized by law.\r\n\r\nI ought not, therefore, to dissemble my fears that there will be a\r\nserious falling off in the estimated proceeds both of the customs and\r\nthe public lands. I regard the evil of disappointment in these respects\r\nas altogether too great to be risked if by any possibility it may be\r\nentirely obviated.\r\n\r\nWhile I am far from objecting, under present circumstances, to the\r\nrecommendation of the Secretary that authority be granted him to reissue\r\nTreasury notes as they shall be redeemed, and to other suggestions which\r\nhe has made on this subject, yet it appears to me to be worthy of grave\r\nconsideration whether more permanent and certain supplies ought not to\r\nbe provided. The issue of one note in redemption of another is not the\r\npayment of a debt, which must be made in the end by some form of public\r\ntaxation.\r\n\r\nI can not forbear to add that in a country so full of resources,\r\nof such abundant means if they be but judiciously called out, the\r\nrevenues of the Government, its credit, and its ability to fulfill all\r\nits obligations ought not to be made dependent on temporary expedients\r\nor on calculations of an uncertain character. The public faith in this\r\nor in all things else ought to be placed beyond question and beyond\r\ncontingency.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of further and full provision for supplying the wants of\r\nthe Treasury will be the more urgent if Congress at this present session\r\nshould adopt no plan for facilitating the financial operations of the\r\nGovernment and improving the currency of the country. By the aid of a\r\nwise and efficient measure of that kind not only would the internal\r\nbusiness and prosperity of the country be revived and invigorated, but\r\nimportant additions to the amount of revenue arising from importations\r\nmight also be confidently expected. Not only does the present condition\r\nof things in relation to the currency and commercial exchanges produce\r\nsevere and distressing embarrassments in the business and pursuits of\r\nindividuals, but its obvious tendency is to create also a necessity\r\nfor the imposition of new burdens of taxation in order to secure the\r\nGovernment and the country against discredit from the failure of means\r\nto fulfill the public engagements.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 18, 1843_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nA resolution has been communicated to me, which was adopted by the House\r\nof Representatives on the 2d instant, in the following terms:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the President of the United States be requested to\r\n  inform this House by what authority and under whose instructions\r\n  Captain Thomas ap Catesby Jones, commander of the squadron of the United\r\n  States in the Pacific Ocean, did, on or about the 19th of October last,\r\n  invade in warlike array the territories of the Mexican Republic, take\r\n  possession of the town of Monterey, and declare himself the commander of\r\n  the naval and military expedition for the occupation of the Californias.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the President of the United States be requested to\r\n  communicate to this House copies of all the instructions given by him\r\n  or under his authority to the said Captain Jones from the time of his\r\n  appointment to the command of the said squadron; also copies of all\r\n  communications received from him relating to his expedition for the\r\n  occupation of the Californias; and also to inform this House whether\r\n  orders have been dispatched to the said Captain Jones recalling him\r\n  from his command.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proceeding of Captain Jones in taking possession of the town\r\nof Monterey, in the possessions of Mexico, was entirely of his own\r\nauthority, and not in consequence of any orders or instructions of\r\nany kind given to him by the Government of the United States. For that\r\nproceeding he has been recalled, and the letter recalling him will be\r\nfound among the papers herewith communicated.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of the House of Representatives asks for \"copies of all\r\nthe instructions given to Captain Jones from the time of his appointment\r\nto the command of the said squadron, also copies of all communications\r\nreceived from him relating to his expedition for the occupation of the\r\nCalifornias,\" without confining the request to such instructions and\r\ncorrespondence as relate to the transactions at Monterey, and without\r\nthe usual reservation of such portions of the instructions or\r\ncorrespondence as in the President's judgment could not be made public\r\nwithout prejudice or danger to the public interests.\r\n\r\nIt may well be supposed that cases may arise even in time of peace in\r\nwhich it would be highly injurious to the country to make public at a\r\nparticular moment the instructions under which a commander may be acting\r\non a distant and foreign service. In such a case, should it arise,\r\nand in all similar cases the discretion of the Executive can not\r\nbe controlled by the request of either House of Congress for the\r\ncommunication of papers. The duties which the Constitution and the laws\r\ndevolve on the President must be performed by him under his official\r\nresponsibility, and he is not at liberty to disregard high interests or\r\nthwart important public objects by untimely publications made against\r\nhis own judgment, by whomsoever such publications may be requested.\r\nIn the present case, not seeing that any injury is likely to arise\r\nfrom so doing, I have directed copies of all the papers asked for to be\r\ncommunicated; and I avail of the opportunity of transmitting also copies\r\nof sundry letters, as noted below.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 20, 1843_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives a report from the Secretary\r\nof State, accompanied by a copy of the correspondence[88] requested by\r\ntheir resolution of the 29th of December last.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: Between the consul-general of the United States at Tangier\r\nand the Government of Morocco.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 20, 1843_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate a report[89] from the Secretary of State, in\r\nanswer to their resolution of the 14th instant.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: Communicating a copy of the commission and instructions\r\nissued to Daniel Webster, Secretary of State, to treat with Lord\r\nAshburton, special minister from Great Britain to the United States.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 24, 1843_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, in answer to their resolutions of the 20th of\r\nDecember and of the 9th instant, the inclosed copies of papers[90] from\r\nthe Department of State, with an accompanying list.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: Correspondence with the United States minister to France\r\nrelative to the quintuple treaty of December 20, 1841, and the Ashburton\r\ntreaty of August 9, 1842.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 27, 1843_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 22d instant, requesting me to communicate to the House \"whatever\r\ncorrespondence or communication may have been received from the British\r\nGovernment respecting the President's construction of the late British\r\ntreaty concluded at Washington as it concerns an alleged right to visit\r\nAmerican vessels,\" I herewith transmit a report made to me by the\r\nSecretary of State.\r\n\r\nI have also thought proper to communicate copies of Lord Aberdeen's\r\nletter of the 20th December, 1841, to Mr. Everett, Mr. Everett's letter\r\nof the 23d December in reply thereto, and extracts from several letters\r\nof Mr. Everett to the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nI can not forego the expression of my regret at the apparent purport of\r\na part of Lord Aberdeen's dispatch to Mr. Fox. I had cherished the hope\r\nthat all possibility of misunderstanding as to the true construction of\r\nthe eighth article of the treaty lately concluded between Great Britain\r\nand the United States was precluded by the plain and well-weighed\r\nlanguage in which it is expressed. The desire of both Governments is to\r\nput an end as speedily as possible to the slave trade, and that desire,\r\nI need scarcely add, is as strongly and as sincerely felt by the United\r\nStates as it can be by Great Britain. Yet it must not be forgotten\r\nthat the trade, though now universally reprobated, was up to a late\r\nperiod prosecuted by all who chose to engage in it, and there were\r\nunfortunately but very few Christian powers whose subjects were not\r\npermitted, and even encouraged, to share in the profits of what was\r\nregarded as a perfectly legitimate commerce. It originated at a period\r\nlong before the United States had become independent and was carried on\r\nwithin our borders in opposition to the most earnest remonstrances and\r\nexpostulations of some of the colonies in which it was most actively\r\nprosecuted. Those engaged in it were as little liable to inquiry or\r\ninterruption as any others. Its character, thus fixed by common consent\r\nand general practice, could only be changed by the positive assent of\r\neach and every nation, expressed either in the form of municipal law\r\nor conventional arrangement. The United States led the way in efforts\r\nto suppress it. They claimed no right to dictate to others, but they\r\nresolved, without waiting for the cooperation of other powers, to\r\nprohibit it to their own citizens and to visit its perpetration by them\r\nwith condign punishment. I may safely affirm that it never occurred\r\nto this Government that any new maritime right accrued to it from the\r\nposition it had thus assumed in regard to the slave trade. If before our\r\nlaws for its suppression the flag of every nation might traverse the\r\nocean unquestioned by our cruisers, this freedom was not, in our\r\nopinion, in the least abridged by our municipal legislation.\r\n\r\nAny other doctrine, it is plain, would subject to an arbitrary and\r\never-varying system of maritime police, adopted at will by the great\r\nnaval power for the time being, the trade of the world in any places\r\nor in any articles which such power might see fit to prohibit to its\r\nown subjects or citizens. A principle of this kind could scarcely be\r\nacknowledged without subjecting commerce to the risk of constant and\r\nharassing vexations.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to justify such a pretension from the right to visit and\r\ndetain ships upon reasonable suspicion of piracy would deservedly be\r\nexposed to universal condemnation, since it would be an attempt to\r\nconvert an established rule of maritime law, incorporated as a principle\r\ninto the international code by the consent of all nations, into a rule\r\nand principle adopted by a single nation and enforced only by its\r\nassumed authority. To seize and detain a ship upon suspicion of piracy,\r\nwith probable cause and in good faith, affords no just ground either for\r\ncomplaint on the part of the nation whose flag she bears or claim of\r\nindemnity on the part of the owner. The universal law sanctions and the\r\ncommon good requires the existence of such a rule. The right under such\r\ncircumstances not only to visit and detain but to search a ship is a\r\nperfect right and involves neither responsibility nor indemnity. But,\r\nwith this single exception, no nation has in time of peace any authority\r\nto detain the ships of another upon the high seas on any pretext\r\nwhatever beyond the limits of her territorial jurisdiction. And such,\r\nI am happy to find, is substantially the doctrine of Great Britain\r\nherself in her most recent official declarations, and even in those now\r\ncommunicated to the House. These declarations may well lead us to doubt\r\nwhether the apparent difference between the two Governments is not\r\nrather one of definition than of principle. Not only is the right of\r\n_search_, properly so called, disclaimed by Great Britain, but even that\r\nof mere visit and inquiry is asserted with qualifications inconsistent\r\nwith the idea of a perfect right.\r\n\r\nIn the dispatch of Lord Aberdeen to Mr. Everett of the 20th of December,\r\n1841, as also in that just received by the British minister in this\r\ncountry made to Mr. Fox, his lordship declares that if in spite of\r\nall the precaution which shall be used to prevent such occurrences an\r\nAmerican ship, by reason of any visit or detention by a British cruiser,\r\n\"should suffer loss and injury, it would be followed by prompt and ample\r\nremuneration;\" and in order to make more manifest her intentions in this\r\nrespect, Lord Aberdeen in the dispatch of the 20th December makes known\r\nto Mr. Everett the nature of the instructions given to the British\r\ncruisers. These are such as, if faithfully observed, would enable the\r\nBritish Government to approximate the standard of a fair indemnity.\r\nThat Government has in several cases fulfilled her promises in this\r\nparticular by making adequate reparation for damage done to our\r\ncommerce. It seems obvious to remark that a right which is only to be\r\nexercised under such restrictions and precautions and risk, in case of\r\nany assignable damage to be followed by the consequences of a trespass,\r\ncan scarcely be considered anything more than a privilege asked for and\r\neither conceded or withheld on the usual principles of international\r\ncomity.\r\n\r\nThe principles laid down in Lord Aberdeen's dispatches and the\r\nassurances of indemnity therein held out, although the utmost reliance\r\nwas placed on the good faith of the British Government, were not\r\nregarded by the Executive as a sufficient security against the abuses\r\nwhich Lord Aberdeen admitted might arise in even the most cautious and\r\nmoderate exercise of their new maritime police, and therefore in my\r\nmessage at the opening of the last session I set forth the views\r\nentertained by the Executive on this subject, and substantially affirmed\r\nboth our inclination and ability to enforce our own laws, protect our\r\nflag from abuse, and acquit ourselves of all our duties and obligations\r\non the high seas. In view of these assertions the treaty of Washington\r\nwas negotiated, and upon consultation with the British negotiator as to\r\nthe quantum of force necessary to be employed in order to attain these\r\nobjects, the result to which the most deliberate estimate led was\r\nembodied in the eighth article of the treaty.\r\n\r\nSuch were my views at the time of negotiating that treaty, and such, in\r\nmy opinion, is its plain and fair interpretation. I regarded the eighth\r\narticle as removing all possible pretext on the ground of mere necessity\r\nto visit and detain our ships upon the African coast because of any\r\nalleged abuse of our flag by slave traders of other nations. We had\r\ntaken upon ourselves the burden of preventing any such abuse by\r\nstipulating to furnish an armed force regarded by both the high\r\ncontracting parties as sufficient to accomplish that object.\r\n\r\nDenying as we did and do all color of right to exercise any such general\r\npolice over the flags of independent nations, we did not demand of Great\r\nBritain any formal renunciation of her pretension; still less had we the\r\nidea of yielding anything ourselves in that respect. We chose to make\r\na practical settlement of the question. This we owed to what we had\r\nalready done upon this subject. The honor of the country called for it;\r\nthe honor of its flag demanded that it should not be used by others to\r\ncover an iniquitous traffic. This Government, I am very sure, has both\r\nthe inclination and the ability to do this; and if need be it will not\r\ncontent itself with a fleet of eighty guns, but sooner than any foreign\r\ngovernment shall exercise the province of executing its laws and\r\nfulfilling its obligations, the highest of which is to protect its flag\r\nalike from abuse or insult, it would, I doubt not, put in requisition\r\nfor that purpose its whole naval power. The purpose of this Government\r\nis faithfully to fulfill the treaty on its part, and it will not permit\r\nitself to doubt that Great Britain will comply with it on hers. In this\r\nway peace will best be preserved and the most amicable relations\r\nmaintained between the two countries.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 27, 1843_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress sundry letters which have passed between the\r\nDepartment of State and the Chevalier d'Argaïz, envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary of Spain near the Government of the United\r\nStates, on the subject of the schooner _Amistad_ since the last\r\ncommunication of papers connected with that case. This correspondence\r\nwill show the general grounds on which the Spanish minister expresses\r\ndissatisfaction with the decision of the Supreme Court in that case and\r\nthe answers which have been made to his complaints by the Department of\r\nState.\r\n\r\nIn laying these papers before Congress I think it proper to observe that\r\nthe allowance of salvage on the cargo does not appear to have been a\r\nsubject of discussion in the Supreme Court. Salvage had been denied in\r\nthe court below and from that part of the decree no appeal had been\r\nclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe ninth article of the treaty between the United States and Spain\r\nprovides that \"all ships and merchandise of what nature soever which\r\nshall be rescued out of the hands of any pirates or robbers on the high\r\nseas shall be brought into some port of either State and shall be\r\ndelivered to the custody of the officers of that port in order to be\r\ntaken care of and restored entire to the true proprietor as soon as due\r\nand sufficient proof shall be made concerning the property thereof.\" The\r\ncase of the _Amistad_, as was decided by the court, was not a case of\r\npiracy, and therefore not within the terms of the treaty; yet it was a\r\ncase in which the authority of the master, officers, and crew of the\r\nvessel had been divested by force, and in that condition the vessel,\r\nhaving been found on the coast, was brought into a port of the United\r\nStates; and it may deserve consideration that the salvors in this case\r\nwere the officers and seamen of a public ship.\r\n\r\nIt is left to Congress to consider, under these circumstances, whether,\r\nalthough in strictness salvage may have been lawfully due, it might not\r\nyet be wise to make provision to refund it, as a proof of the entire\r\ngood faith of the Government and of its disposition to fulfill all its\r\ntreaty stipulations to their full extent under a fair and liberal\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 28, 1843_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a convention further to provide for the payment of\r\nawards in favor of claimants under the convention between the United\r\nStates and the Mexican Republic of the 11th of April, 1839, signed\r\nin the City of Mexico on the 30th day of last month. A copy of the\r\ninstructions from the Department of State to the minister of the United\r\nStates at Mexico relative to the convention and of the dispatches of\r\nthat minister to the Department is also communicated. By adverting to\r\nthe signatures appended to the original draft of the convention as\r\ntransmitted from the Department of State to General Thompson it will be\r\nseen that the convention as concluded was substantially approved by the\r\nrepresentatives of a large majority in value of the parties immediately\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 28, 1843_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to the House of Representatives a report from the\r\nSecretary of State, which, with the documents[91] accompanying it,\r\nfurnishes the information requested by their resolution of the 18th\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: Correspondence between the representatives of foreign\r\ngovernments and the United States relative to the operation of the\r\ntariff laws on treaties existing with foreign governments.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 3, 1843_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn submitting the name of Henry A. Wise to the Senate for the mission\r\nto France, I was led to do so by considerations of his high talent,\r\nhis exalted character, and great moral worth. The country, I feel\r\nassured, would be represented at Paris in the person of Mr. Wise by\r\none wholly unsurpassed in exalted patriotism and well fitted to be the\r\nrepresentative of his country abroad. His rejection by the Senate has\r\ncaused me to reconsider his qualifications, and I see no cause to doubt\r\nthat he is eminently qualified for the station. I feel it, therefore,\r\nto be my duty to renominate him.\r\n\r\nI nominate Henry A. Wise, of Virginia, to be envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary to the Court of His Majesty the King of the\r\nFrench, in place of Lewis Cass, resigned.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 3, 1843.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn submitting to you the name of Caleb Cushing as Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, I did so in full view of his consummate abilities, his\r\nunquestioned patriotism and full capacity to discharge with honor to\r\nhimself and advantage to the country the high and important duties\r\nappertaining to that Department of the Government. The respect which\r\nI have for the wisdom of the Senate has caused me again, since his\r\nrejection, to reconsider his merits and his qualifications. That review\r\nhas satisfied me that I could not have a more able adviser in the\r\nadministration of public affairs or the country a more faithful officer.\r\nI feel it, therefore, to be my duty to renominate him.\r\n\r\nI nominate Caleb Gushing to be Secretary of the Treasury, in the place\r\nof Walter Forward, resigned.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 3, 1843_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives copies of the final\r\nreport and appendices of the joint commission appointed to explore and\r\nsurvey the boundary line between the States of Maine and New Hampshire\r\nand the adjoining British Provinces, together with a general map showing\r\nthe results of their labors.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Report of the commissioners appointed by the President of the United\r\nStates for the purpose of exploring and surveying the boundary line\r\nbetween the States of Maine and New Hampshire and the British\r\nProvinces_.[92]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: This report proper and Appendix No. 1 are the only\r\nportions of the original final report which can be found filed with the\r\narchives of the commission.

DANIEL WEBSTER,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\nSIR: The operations of the divisions under the direction of the several\r\ncommissioners during the past season have been as follows, viz:\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe work remaining to be performed by the division under the direction\r\nof the chairman of the board was as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The completion of the survey of the line of highlands around the\r\nsources of the Rimouski, filling up the gap left in former surveys in\r\nthe line of boundary claimed by the United States.\r\n\r\n2. The survey of the line of highlands rising from the northern side of\r\nthe Bay of Chaleurs at its western extremity from the point visited and\r\nmeasured in 1840 to its connection with the line surveyed in 1841 in the\r\nvicinity of Lake Metis.\r\n\r\n3. The astronomical determination of the longitude of one or more points\r\nin the surveyed lines, in order to the compilation of a geographical map\r\nof undeniable accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe party, which was dispatched at the earliest possible period, having\r\nbeen recalled by a special messenger as soon as the signature of the\r\ntreaty of Washington was made known to the commissioner, no more than\r\nthe first of these objects was attempted, and some of the observations\r\nthat would have been considered necessary to make this survey useful as\r\nevidence in case of a further discussion of the subject of boundary were\r\nnot completed. The expedition has, however, obtained for its results an\r\naccurate survey of the Green River of St. John from its mouth to the\r\nportage between it and the South Branch of the Katawamkedgwick, a survey\r\nof that portage, and a careful chain and compass survey of the highlands\r\nsurrounding the sources of Rimouski. The first of these is connected\r\nwith the survey of the river St. John made by Major Graham; the last\r\nwas united at its two extremities with stations of the survey of 1841.\r\nThroughout the whole of the surveys the latitudes were carefully\r\ndetermined, by the methods employed during the former years, at a\r\nsufficient number of points. The longitudes have been estimated by the\r\nuse of chronometers, but the sudden recall of the party left the latter\r\npart of the task incomplete. Any defect arising from the latter cause\r\nmay be considered as in a great degree compensated by the connections\r\nreferred to with the work of Major Graham and the surveys of the\r\nprevious years.\r\n\r\nThe party left Portland to take the field on the 18th June, and reached\r\nthe Grand Falls of the St. John on its return on the 25th August.\r\n\r\nThe surplus stores, with the boats and camp equipage, were stored there,\r\nand were afterwards transferred to the parties of the two other\r\ncommissioners.\r\n\r\nA map of the operations of this division was placed on file in the State\r\nDepartment on the 27th December.\r\n\r\nThe distance surveyed along Green River from its mouth to the portage is\r\n57 miles, the length of the portage 5-1/2 miles, the distance measured\r\nin exploration of the remaining portion of the boundary claimed by the\r\nUnited States 61-1/2 miles, making in all 124 miles.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe parties under the direction of A. Talcott entered upon their field\r\nduties about the middle of September, and completed that branch of the\r\nservice by the 5th of November.\r\n\r\nDuring that period the following rivers and streams were surveyed:\r\n\r\n1. The \"main St. John River\" from the mouth of the \"Alleguash\" to the\r\nForks.\r\n\r\n2. The \"Southwest Branch\" to its source at the Metjarmette portage.\r\n\r\n3. The \"South Branch,\" or \"Wool-as-ta-qua-guam,\" to 5 miles above Bakers\r\nLake and near to the exploring line of 1841 along the highlands claimed\r\nby Great Britain.\r\n\r\n4. The \"West Branch,\" or \"Mat-ta-wa-quam,\" to its source in the highlands.\r\n\r\n5. The \"Northwest Branch\" to its source in the highlands.\r\n\r\n6. The \"Big Black River,\" or \"Chim-pas-a-ooc-ten,\" to its source.\r\n\r\n7. The \"Little Black River,\" or \"Pas-a-ooc-ten.\"\r\n\r\n8. The \"Chim-mem-ti-cook River\" as far as navigable.\r\n\r\nThe character of all these streams is the same--slack water of moderate\r\ndepth alternating with rapids. They can never be navigated by anything\r\nlarger than a bateau.\r\n\r\nThe method of survey was to trace the course of each stream by compass,\r\nestimating distances by the eye, or by pacing when the nature of the\r\nmargin of the river would permit.\r\n\r\nThe average distance coursed per day was about 9 miles, and at the camps\r\nformed at night astronomical observations north and south of the zenith\r\nwere made to determine their position in latitude, and observations for\r\nthe local time to ascertain their differences of longitude.\r\n\r\nMeridian observations of the sun were also made at a point intermediate\r\nto the camps whenever they could be obtained.\r\n\r\nThirty-three of these points have been used in the correction of the\r\npaced and estimated distances.\r\n\r\nTables exhibiting these observations, their calculation and results,\r\nwill accompany the detailed maps.\r\n\r\nWith a view to facilitate the operations of the joint commission it was\r\nconceived to be important that the intersection of the parallel of 46°\r\n25' with the Southwest Branch should be ascertained, as also the point\r\non the Northwest Branch (10 miles from the main St. John) where the\r\nboundary line from the outlet of Lake Pohenagamook intersects the said\r\nbranch.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that these points are projected on the map which\r\naccompanies this report so near to their true position that the line\r\nindicating the boundary as drawn on the map may be considered to\r\nsubstantially exhibit the division of territory as effected by the late\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nThe more thorough knowledge acquired through these explorations of the\r\ncharacter of the territory which has been relinquished by the United\r\nStates fully confirms the opinion previously entertained of its little\r\nvalue, either for its timber growth or for purposes of agriculture.\r\n\r\nBordering on the \"Big Black\" and \"Little Black\" rivers the growth of\r\npine is large and apparently of good quality, and it is believed that\r\nmost of the smaller streams falling into the St. John below the \"Seven\r\nIslands\" will be found fringed with pine, but it is quite certain that\r\nvery little will be found included between the lines of boundary and the\r\nhighlands as claimed by the United States to the westward of St. Francis\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nThe office work of this party is nearly completed, all the calculations\r\narising from the astronomical observations have been made, and the\r\ndetailed maps (five in number) drawn to the scale of 1:50,000 (or nearly\r\n1-1/4 inches to 1 mile), exhibiting the result of the surveys in 1840,\r\n1841, and 1842, are in such a state of forwardness as to insure their\r\ncompletion by the middle of February.\r\n\r\nThese explorations and surveys embrace--\r\n\r\n1. The highlands as claimed by the United States, extending from the\r\nnorthwesternmost head of the Connecticut River to the portage road which\r\nleads from the St. Lawrence River to Lake Temiscouata.\r\n\r\n2. The highlands as claimed by Great Britain from the Metjarmette\r\nportage to the source of the Aroostook River.\r\n\r\n3. All the principal heads or branches of the Connecticut River north of\r\nthe forty-fifth degree of latitude.\r\n\r\n4. The St. John and all its principal branches or tributaries west of\r\nthe Alleguash River.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThe division under the direction of Major Graham has been employed\r\nduring the past season in making the following surveys, viz:\r\n\r\n1. In prolonging the meridian of the monument at the source of the river\r\nSt. Croix.\r\n\r\n2. In making a survey of the Little Madawaska River, a tributary to the\r\nAroostook, from its mouth to its source in the Madawaska Lakes.\r\n\r\n3. In surveying the group of lakes lying northwest of the Madawaska\r\nLakes, known by the appellation of the Eagle Lakes, or sometimes by the\r\naboriginal one of the Cheaplawgan Lakes, and especially to ascertain if\r\nthose lakes, or any of them, emptied their waters into the river St.\r\nJohn by any other outlet than Fish River.\r\n\r\n4. A survey of the portion of Fish River included between the outlet of\r\nLake Winthrop and the river St. John.\r\n\r\n5. A survey of the river St. John between the Grand Falls and the mouth\r\nof the Alleguash.\r\n\r\n6. A survey of the Alleguash from its mouth to its source.\r\n\r\n7. A survey of the river St. Francis from its mouth to the outlet of\r\nLake St. Francis.\r\n\r\n8. In making astronomical observations for the latitude and longitude of\r\nthe Grand Falls and the mouths of the Grand, the Green, Madawaska, Fish,\r\nand St. Francis rivers.\r\n\r\nEarly in July a party under the direction of an officer of Topographical\r\nEngineers was sent into the field and directed to occupy the most\r\nnorthern astronomical station fixed the preceding year upon the true\r\nmeridian of the monument at the source of the river St. Croix, with the\r\nview of being prepared to complete its trace to the northwest angle of\r\nNova Scotia before the termination of the season in case the pending\r\nnegotiations for a conventional boundary should fail.\r\n\r\nThe true meridian was in this way prolonged to a point 19 miles north\r\nof the station alluded to of last year, or 13-1/2 miles north of its\r\nintersection with the river St. John, reaching to the summit of the\r\nheight immediately south of Grand River, where a permanent station was\r\nfixed. The point thus fixed is 90-3/4 miles north of the monument at\r\nthe source of the St. Croix.\r\n\r\nThis portion of the work was performed by the 15th of August, at which\r\nperiod it was considered inexpedient to incur the expense of continuing\r\nit any farther.\r\n\r\nA party under the direction of another officer of Topographical\r\nEngineers, which took the field also in July was charged with the\r\nsurveys of the Little Madawaska River, the Eagle or Cheaplawgan Lakes,\r\nthe portion of Fish River from the outlet of Lake Winthrop--one of the\r\nEagle group--to its débouché into the St. John, of the river St. John,\r\nthence to the meridian of the source of the St. Croix, and finally of\r\nthe Alleguash from its mouth to its source.\r\n\r\nThe Little Madawaska was ascended in bateaux from its mouth to its\r\nsource, which is found in the Madawaska Lakes, and a trace of the river\r\nwas made by coursing with a compass and estimating the distances, which\r\nwere checked by astronomical observations for latitude and longitude.\r\n\r\nThe position of its mouth had been fixed by the surveys of the preceding\r\nyear, and observations for latitude and longitude were made at a point\r\nintermediate between its mouth and its source and also at the junction\r\nof the two lakes which form its source. The trace of the river was\r\ncorrected so as to agree with the results of these observations before\r\nbeing laid down upon the map.\r\n\r\nA portage of 5-1/4 miles was cut from the Madawaska to the Eagle Lakes,\r\nwhich are only 4-3/4 miles apart in a direct line. The party transported\r\ntheir baggage and boats by this portage and launched them on Lake\r\nSedgwick, the most southern and largest of the Eagle group.\r\n\r\nThis group, which is composed of the Winthrop, Sedgwick, Preble, Bear,\r\nand Cleveland lakes, being all connected one with another by water\r\ncommunications between them, was carefully surveyed by triangulating\r\nthem and coursing their shores with the chain and compass, except those\r\nparts which were so straight as to render the work sufficiently accurate\r\nby sketching those portions between consecutive points of triangulation\r\nof no great distance apart. They were also sounded so far as to obtain\r\ntheir general depths.\r\n\r\nThe survey was continued from the outlet of Lake Winthrop down Fish\r\nRiver to its mouth, which was found to be the only outlet from this\r\ngroup to the river St. John.\r\n\r\nLake Cleveland, the most northern and deepest of the group, was\r\nconnected in position with the river St. John at a point 2 miles below\r\nthe upper chapel of the Madawaska settlement, by a chained and coursed\r\nline following the portage represented on the map 5-1/6 miles long.\r\n\r\nThe Alleguash was ascended in the month of October in bateaux and canoes\r\nfrom its mouth to its source in Lake Telos, a distance of about 94\r\nmiles. The river and its lakes were coursed by a compass, the distances\r\nestimated, and the projection resulting therefrom corrected before being\r\nplaced upon the map by means of astronomical observations at eight\r\nintermediate points between its mouth and its source. The lakes were\r\ntriangulated by means of magnetic bearings as far as was practicable,\r\nin order to obtain their widths and general contour. In the vicinity\r\nof Chamberlain Lake use has also been made of a recent survey of Mr.\r\nParrott, a surveyor in the employ of the State of Maine, to whom we\r\nacknowledge ourselves indebted for the aid which this portion of his\r\nvaluable labors furnished us.\r\n\r\nBetween the head of Lake Telos and Webster Pond, one of the sources\r\nof the East Branch of the Penobscot, there is a portage of only 1 mile\r\nand a half. This, together with a small cut or canal, made in 1841 to\r\nconnect the waters of Lake Telos with those of Webster Pond, enabled the\r\nparty which made this survey to proceed with their boats and baggage\r\ndown the Penobscot to Bangor, where they and their surplus stores were\r\ndisposed of.\r\n\r\nA survey of the river St. John was made in the month of September with\r\nthe chain and compass from the mouth of Fish River to the intersection\r\nof the meridian of the monument at the source of the St. Croix with the\r\nSt. John. This survey was afterwards extended eastward to the Grand\r\nFalls, in order to connect with the astronomical station established\r\nthere, and westward to the mouth of the Alleguash, embracing a distance\r\nof 87 miles. The islands were all surveyed, and the channels on either\r\nside of them sounded.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner, having had other duties assigned him in reference\r\nto the question of boundary, did not take the field in person until\r\nSeptember. Between the middle of that month and the middle of December\r\nhe was occupied in performing the field duties assigned him by the\r\nDepartment of State.\r\n\r\nThe party conducted by him in person made the astronomical observations\r\nfor the determination of the latitude and longitude of the Grand Falls\r\nof the St. John, and of the mouths of the Grand, Green, Madawaska, Fish,\r\nand St. Francis rivers, all tributary to the St. John.\r\n\r\nThe same party also made a survey of the river St. Francis from its\r\nmouth to the outlet of Lake St. Francis, a distance of 81 miles.\r\n\r\nThis river was coursed by means of a compass, and whenever the nature\r\nof the shores would permit the distances from bend to bend were either\r\nmeasured with a chain or paced. Through the greater part of the stream,\r\nhowever, the impediments offered by the thick and small growth near the\r\nshores rendered this degree of minuteness impracticable and a resort to\r\nestimating the distances by the eye, well practiced by previous actual\r\nmeasurements, became necessary.\r\n\r\nBefore putting the trace of the river thus derived upon the map it was\r\nadjusted to correspond with the results of astronomical observations for\r\nlatitude and longitude at twelve intermediate points between its mouth\r\nand the outlet of Lake St. Francis. Its three principal lakes, viz,\r\nPettiquaggamas, Petteiquaggamak, and Pohenagamook, were triangulated and\r\nsounded as exhibited by the maps of detail yet to be handed in of the\r\noperations of this division.\r\n\r\nA profile of the river, exhibiting the slope of the country through\r\nwhich it flows, was obtained by barometric observations made at fifteen\r\npoints between its mouth and the bridge where it is intersected by the\r\nGrand portage road.\r\n\r\nA connection was made with Long Lake, a tributary to Lake Temiscouata,\r\nby a chained line from a point on the St. Francis 2 miles below the\r\nmouth of Blue River to the western shore of Long Lake, by which it was\r\nascertained that the shore of this lake approached within 2-3/4 miles of\r\nthe river St. Francis.\r\n\r\nThe outlet of Lake Pohenagamook was reached in a distance of 49-3/4\r\nmiles from the mouth of the St. Francis following the sinuosities of the\r\nriver on the 18th of October.\r\n\r\nA camp was established on the southwest shore of the lake at its outlet\r\nfor the purpose of making the necessary astronomical observations to\r\ndetermine the latitude and longitude of this position. Ten days were\r\nspent here for this object, out of which we had only three nights that\r\nwere favorable for observation. These were improved as far as possible,\r\nand the results obtained, combined with those obtained by Captain\r\nTalcott's parties on the Northwest and Southwest branches of the St.\r\nJohn, have furnished the elements for laying down upon the general map\r\nthe straight lines which show the boundary as it is required to run\r\nbetween the highlands and the river St. John under the treaty of 1842.\r\nThese furnish data for an accurate exhibition of the extent of territory\r\nincluded by this portion of the boundary as fixed by that treaty.\r\n\r\nThe south shore of Lake Pohenagamook forms an angle of about 100° with\r\nthe direction of the stream which flows from it, and marks with great\r\ncertainty the point at which, according to the late treaty, the straight\r\nline is to be commenced in running the boundary southwestward to the\r\nNorthwest Branch of the river St. John.\r\n\r\nThe work of this division was connected with that of Captain Talcott's\r\ndivision of the preceding year by noting the position of a common point\r\non the western shore of Lake Pohenagamook near its head.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner and his party reached the Grand portage, or British\r\nmilitary road, where it crosses the river St. Francis on the 2d of\r\nNovember, and connected their work with that of Professor Renwick's\r\ndivision of the preceding year at the bridge near Fournier's house.\r\n\r\nObservations were also made at this bridge for the latitude and\r\nlongitude, when the weather was favorable, between the nights of the\r\n2d and 5th of November, and a connection was made in longitude with\r\nthe meridian of Quebec by comparisons of the local time with three\r\nchronometers transported from the first to the last mentioned place\r\nbetween the 6th and 10th of November.\r\n\r\nThis comparison was repeated on the return of the commissioner by\r\nobserving again at the St. Francis bridge before mentioned on the night\r\nof the 10th of December, with the thermometer ranging during these\r\nobservations from 11 to 15° below zero of Fahrenheit's scale, there\r\nbeing then near 4 feet of snow upon the ground. The commissioner then\r\nproceeded by the Grand portage road, and the road which pursues the\r\nmargin of Temiscouata Lake and the valleys of the Madawaska and St. John\r\nrivers, to the mouth of Green River, where on the night of the 12th of\r\nDecember he again observed at the same point where his observations of\r\nthe 29th of September were made while ascending the St. John.

RENWICK,\r\n  A. TALCOTT,\r\n    JAMES D. GRAHAM,\r\n      _Commissioners_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX No. 1.\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS OF THE DIVISION UNDER THE DIRECTION OF JAMES RENWICK, LL.D.,\r\nCHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD.\r\n\r\nI.--_Operations during the year 1841_.\r\n\r\n1. At as early a period as there was any probability of the country\r\nbeing accessible two engineers were dispatched from the city of New York\r\nfor the purpose of exploring the Rimouski River. This had been crossed\r\nby the commissioner late in the previous season. It had been ascertained\r\nthat it took its source much farther to the south than was represented\r\non any map, and that at its head would be the greatest difficulty in the\r\nintended researches. It was, besides, considered necessary that skillful\r\nboatmen and practiced woodsmen should be engaged in Canada. These it was\r\nbelieved could be found in Quebec, and the chief of this detachment,\r\nwith an appointment as acting commissioner, was directed to perform this\r\nduty on his route.\r\n\r\nThis detachment accordingly left New York on the 22d May. On reaching\r\nQuebec it was found that the proper persons could only be engaged at\r\nTrois Rivieres. A delay was thus occasioned before this part of the duty\r\ncould be performed. The detachment, however, reached Rimouski 4th June,\r\nwhere the snow was still found upon the ground and the river barely fit\r\nfor the access of boats. No time had therefore been lost, and the\r\nreconnoissance of the river was successfully performed. The detachment,\r\nafter passing all the establishments of lumberers, extended its\r\nexplorations beyond the remotest Indian paths, and leaving its boats\r\npenetrated on foot several miles to the south of the highest point\r\nof the stream in which boats could float. In this progress through\r\nunexplored ground a lake wholly unknown was discovered. The results of\r\nthis expedition were embodied in a map, which on examination by parties\r\nfurnished with better means was found accurate.\r\n\r\nIt was found by this party that the Rimouski presented difficulties\r\nwhich would forbid its ascent by a party provided with stores and\r\ninstruments for the prosecution of a survey along the height of land,\r\nand that it would be impracticable even to make it the route of an\r\nexpedition to reach its own source. The little knowledge which was\r\npossessed of its upper course and the fact that it had probably never\r\nbeen explored even by Indian hunters were accounted for by its\r\ndifficulty of access, which would forbid the carriage of a sufficient\r\nsupply of provisions for consumption during its ascent and descent. On\r\nother streams difficulties of this sort had been and were afterwards\r\novercome by the use of the bateaux of the Penobscot, of greater burthen\r\nand strength than the birch canoes, but the continual repetition of\r\nportages on the Rimouski forbade the use of any vessel heavier than the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n2. The main body of engineers, etc., was ordered to assemble in New York\r\non the 15th May, for which time a vessel was chartered for the purpose\r\nof conveying them, with stores sufficient for an expedition of five\r\nmonths and the necessary instruments and camp equipage, to Metis, on the\r\nSt. Lawrence. The experience of the former season had shown that the\r\ncountry was so poor as to furnish little for the support of a numerous\r\nparty, and it was believed that even game and fish would be found scarce\r\nat the points where supplies would be most needed. It was therefore to\r\nbe chosen between laying in the supplies in New York or in Quebec, and\r\nwhile the great advantage of conveying all the important instruments\r\nby sea turned the scale in favor of the former place, it has been\r\nascertained that the decision was in other respects correct, for the\r\ndangers and difficulties of navigating the St. Lawrence might have\r\nfrustrated altogether, and would certainly have materially delayed,\r\nthe commencement of the main survey.\r\n\r\nThe sailing of the vessel was delayed, in expectation of the arrival of\r\ninstruments from Europe, until the 30th of May, when a sufficient supply\r\nfor beginning the operations arrived.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Mr. Lally, one of the first assistants, was directed to\r\nproceed to Bangor, in Maine, for the purpose of procuring boats and men\r\nto manage them. These were obtained and brought down the Penobscot to\r\nCastine, where they were on the 8th June embarked in the vessel which\r\ncarried the rest of the party, and which had orders to call at that port\r\nfor the purpose. The experience of the previous year had manifested the\r\ngreat superiority of the bateaux of the Penobscot over all other vessels\r\nin the navigation of shallow and rapid rivers. The physical energy and\r\nenterprise of the boatmen of that river had also been known. It was\r\nbelieved that it was not only essential that a considerable proportion\r\nof the laboring force should be American citizens, but that much good\r\nwould result from emulation between the boatmen of the Penobscot and the\r\nCanadian voyageurs. This expectation was in a great degree confirmed by\r\nthe result, for although it must be stated with regret that it became\r\nnecessary at an early period to discharge some of the Americans,\r\nthe remainder were models of intelligence, sobriety, industry, and\r\nperseverance, and entered into the work, not with the feelings of hired\r\nlaborers, but with those of men who felt that the interest of their\r\ncountry was at stake.\r\n\r\n3. The commissioner did not leave New York until 30th of June, being\r\ndelayed in expectation of more instruments. A part of these only\r\nhad arrived, but further delay might have been injurious. Proper\r\ninstructions had been given for setting the party in motion in case it\r\ncould be organized before he joined it, but these were rendered nugatory\r\nby the length of the vessel's passage. This did not reach Metis till\r\n7th July, so that the commissioner, arriving on the 9th, was in time\r\nto direct the first operations in person. The stores, boats, and\r\ninstruments had been landed and partially carried to a camp on the river\r\nabove the falls. A heavy rain on the 10th July rendered the roads almost\r\nimpassable, and it was not till the morning of the 12th that the first\r\ndetachment could be embarked. This was comprised of Dr. O. Goodrich,\r\nthe assistant commissary, two surveyors, and an assistant engineer. The\r\nfirst was in charge of stores sufficient for six weeks' consumption. The\r\nsurveyors had orders to survey the river for the purpose of connecting\r\nit with the line of exploration, and the latter was directed to make\r\nbarometric observations. The commissioner and the remaining engineers\r\nwere detained at Metis by the necessary astronomic observations. These\r\nbeing completed, the instruments, camp equipage, and a portion of the\r\nstores were embarked, and the main body proceeded up the river about\r\nnoon on the 15th July.\r\n\r\n4. The river was found to be still swollen by the melting of the snows\r\non the highlands near its source, and, being at all times rapid, the\r\nprogress of the party was attended both with difficulty and danger. One\r\nof the birch canoes, although managed by a skillful voyageur, was twice\r\nupset, and one of the heavily loaded bateaux filled with water in a\r\nrapid. The result of the first accident was unimportant, except as\r\nrespected the personal comfort of one of the party, who lost his\r\nclothing when it could not be replaced; the second accident caused the\r\nloss of some valuable stores. A guide had been procured in the person of\r\na Canadian who was said to have acted in the same capacity to Captain\r\nBroughton, who had descended the river by order of the commissioners\r\nof Great Britain in 1840. So long as the services of the guide were\r\nunimportant he was found intelligent and acquainted with the country,\r\nbut on passing beyond the region usually visited by lumbering parties\r\nhe manifested a very scanty knowledge. It had been the intention of the\r\ncommissioner to ascend to Lake Metis and thence proceed to the height of\r\nland by an old portage said to have existed from that lake to the one\r\nat the head of the Grande Fourche of the Restigouche, which had been\r\nexplored by the commissioner in 1840. Lake Metis was chosen because all\r\nformer accounts, and particularly those of the surveyors of the joint\r\ncommission under the fifth article of the treaty of Ghent, represented\r\nthis as the body of water seen to the northwest of the termination\r\nof the exploring meridian line. The guide appeared to confirm this\r\nimpression, and held out inducements that led to the belief that he was\r\nacquainted with the portage in question. The nearer, however, it was\r\napproached the less seemed to be his confidence. When there appeared\r\nto be some reason to doubt his competency or his will, a place in the\r\nriver was reached where it divided into two branches of nearly equal\r\nmagnitude. On inquiry from the guide it was ascertained that the\r\neasternmost of these was the main Metis, the other the Mistigougeche\r\n(Riviere au Foin). Although the latter appeared to be the most direct\r\ncourse to the boundary, it was still believed, and nothing could be\r\nlearned from him to the contrary, that the former led to the termination\r\nof the exploring meridian line. The party of Dr. Goodrich had gone up\r\nthe Metis, and it was necessary to communicate with it before any change\r\nin plan could be made. The commissioner therefore entered the main\r\nMetis, and in the evening overtook the surveyors, who had been unable\r\nto keep the survey up with the progress of the boats. An express was\r\ntherefore sent forward to stop the boats, and, the party encamping,\r\nastronomic observations were made for the solution of the difficulty in\r\nwhich it appeared to be enveloped. A detachment was also sent out to\r\nexplore to the eastward of the Metis. This reached the Lake of the\r\nLittle Red River, and from its banks took bearings to what appeared to\r\nbe the greatest mountain of the country. This is known by the name of\r\nPaganet, and lies to the southwest of Lake Matapediac, forming a part of\r\nthe highlands which are so obviously described as the boundary of the\r\nProvince of Quebec in the proclamation of 1763. Its height was reported\r\nto be probably 3,000 feet, but as it has appeared in the course of the\r\nsurvey that heights in that region may easily be overestimated, it\r\ncan not be safely taken at more than 2,500 feet. The result of the\r\nastronomic observations seemed to show that the main stream would lead\r\ntoo far to the eastward, and after mature deliberation it was resolved\r\nthat the course should be retraced and the Mistigougeche ascended. The\r\nfirst part of the operation was attended with little delay. Half an hour\r\nsufficed for reaching the forks, whence the party had been six hours in\r\nmounting. The guide also stated that the Mistigougeche was a much less\r\ndifficult stream than Metis. Of the comparative facility, except for a\r\nfew miles of the latter, no opportunity for judging was obtained; but\r\nthese were so difficult as to confirm his statement. On the other hand,\r\nthe former was found to be much worse than it had been represented by\r\nhim. His knowledge, in fact, was limited to its state in winter, for\r\nit appeared from a subsequent interview with Captain Broughton to be\r\ndoubtful whether he had served in the employ of that officer; and it can\r\nbe well imagined that the river when locked up in ice should present\r\nan aspect of far less rapidity than when rushing with its springtide\r\nviolence. The Mistigougeche was found to be intercepted by a fall of a\r\nfew feet, which could not be passed by the boats when loaded, although\r\nthe Penobscot men boldly and successfully carried theirs up when empty,\r\nin which feat they were imitated by the voyageurs, who had at first\r\ndeemed it impossible. The loads of the boats were carried over a\r\nportage, and in this operation the chronometers were found to deviate\r\nfrom each other, showing a manifest change of rate in some or all of\r\nthem. This may be ascribed to a change in the mode of transportation,\r\nbut was more than could be reasonably anticipated, considering the\r\nshortness of the portage (2,000 yards) and the great care that was taken\r\nin conveying them. At some distance above the falls a lake of moderate\r\nsize was reached, embosomed in hills and embarrassed at its upper end\r\nwith grass. From the last feature it was ascertained that both lake and\r\nriver take their epithet of Grassy (Riviere an Foin, and, in Indian,\r\nof Mistigougeche, or Grassy Lake). At this lake the party of the\r\ncommissioner was in advance of the loaded boats. A halt was therefore\r\nmade and a party sent out to explore to the westward. This party reached\r\nan eminence whence a lake was seen, which the guide stated to be the\r\nhead of a branch of the Rimouski, far distant, as he averred, from any\r\nwaters of the Restigouche. Subsequent examination has shown that this\r\nparty had actually reached the height of land and that the survey of the\r\nboundary might have been advantageously commenced from this point.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the lake the river was found to have a gentle current for a\r\nfew miles. It was then interrupted by a bed of timber, after passing\r\nwhich it became as rapid as ever. In a short time, however, a noble\r\nsheet of water was reached, surrounded by lofty hills, and of great\r\ndepth. At the upper end of this a place was chosen for a stationary\r\ncamp, and preparations were made for proceeding to the land survey.\r\nWhile these were going forward with as much dispatch as possible, Mr.\r\nLally, one of the first assistants, was detached to reconnoiter the\r\ninlet of the lake. During his absence observations were taken and the\r\nrates of the chronometers worked up. Of the four instruments with which\r\nthe expedition was furnished, two had varied from the other two on\r\nthe portage. All were of good reputation, and no means existed of\r\ndetermining on which pair reliance could be placed. From the rates\r\nof two of them it appeared that the camp was situated 12 miles to the\r\nnorthwest of the tree chosen by the American surveyors in 1818 as\r\nmarking the northwest angle of Nova Scotia. Actual survey has shown that\r\nthe distance is about 10 miles. The result given by the chronometers was\r\nspeedily confirmed by the return of Mr. Lally, who reported that he had\r\nactually reached the marked tree, well known to him by his visit to it\r\nthe year before, and that he had pursued for a couple of miles the line\r\ncut out subsequently by Captain Broughton.\r\n\r\n6. The preparations being completed, Messrs. H.B. Renwick and Lally were\r\nsent out, each at the head of a sufficient party, with instructions to\r\nproceed together to the west until they reached waters running to the\r\nRestigouche and then to divide, Mr. Lally proceeding to the northwest\r\nangle and Mr. Renwick toward Rimouski. Each was directed to pursue as\r\nfar as possible the height of land and to remain in the field as long\r\nas the supplies which the men could carry would permit. They were also\r\nordered to mark their path in order to insure a safe return, as well as\r\nall the stations of their barometric observations. Bach of the laborers\r\nwas loaded with 56 pounds besides his own baggage and ax, and the\r\nengineers and surveyors carried their own baggage and instruments. The\r\ncommissioner, with one assistant, remained in the stationary camp for\r\nthe purpose of determining the longitude accurately and of making\r\ncorresponding barometric observations.\r\n\r\n7. In this place it will be proper to state that the lake which was thus\r\nreached was ascertained with certainty to be that seen by the surveyors\r\nof the joint commission in 1818, and which was by them supposed to be\r\nLake Metis. As it has no name yet assigned to it, it has been called\r\nupon our maps Lake Johnson, in honor of the American surveyor by whom it\r\nwas first visited. It is 1,007 feet above the level of the sea, being\r\nmore than twice as much as the total fall assigned to the waters of the\r\nMetis in the report of Messrs. Mudge and Featherstonhaugh. So great an\r\nelevation in so short a course is sufficient to account for the great\r\nrapidity of the stream. To illustrate this rapidity in an obvious\r\nmanner, the birch canoes, which on the waters of the St. John are easily\r\nmanaged by one man, are never intrusted on those of the Metis to less\r\nthan two. Our departure from Metis in boats so deeply loaded, as was\r\nafterwards learned, was considered there as a desperate attempt, and\r\nalthough but one of them sustained injury, this is to be ascribed to the\r\ngreat skill of the boatmen; and to show the velocity of the stream in a\r\nstill stronger light, it is to be recollected that, after deducting the\r\nloss of time on the Metis, nine days of incessant labor were spent in\r\ntaking up the loaded boats, while the assistant commissary whom it\r\nbecame necessary to send to Metis left the stationary camp at 2 o'clock\r\nin the morning of the 28th July and reached the mouth of the river\r\nbefore sunset of the same day, after making two portages, one of 2,000\r\nyards and the other of 2 miles.\r\n\r\n8. The first day of the operations of Messrs. H.B. Renwick and Lally was\r\nattended with an accident which had an injurious effect. The surveyor of\r\nMr. Lally's party, Mr. W.G. Waller, fell from a tree laid as a bridge\r\nacross a stream and lamed himself to such a degree as to be incapable\r\neither of proceeding with the party or of returning to the stationary\r\ncamp. It became necessary, therefore, to leave him, with a man to attend\r\nhim, in the woods, and it was a week before he was sufficiently\r\nrecovered to be able to walk. Intelligence was immediately sent to the\r\ncommissioner, by whom the assistant he had retained in camp to aid in\r\nastronomic observations was sent to take the place of the surveyor. Two\r\ndays were thus lost, and the intended astronomic observations were far\r\nless numerous than they might have been with the aid of a competent\r\nassistant.\r\n\r\nThe two parties, proceeding together, reached Katawamkedgwick Lake. That\r\nunder the direction of Mr. H.B. Renwick immediately crossed it, while\r\nthat of Mr. Lally proceeded along the eastern bank for the purpose of\r\nreaching the source of the stream. This being attained, the party of\r\nMr. L. pursued the height of land as nearly as possible and reached the\r\nexploring meridian line. Crossing this, some progress was made to the\r\neastward, when a failure of provisions compelled a return to camp. The\r\nparty of Mr. H.B. Renwick, proceeding until the Rimouski was seen,\r\nturned to the south and finally reached the southeasterly source of that\r\nriver, a point probably never before pressed by human foot, for it was\r\nfound to consist in a series of beaver ponds, in which that animal was\r\nresiding in communities and without any appearance of having been ever\r\ndisturbed. The low state of provisions in this instance also called the\r\nparty back, but not before every anticipated result had been obtained.\r\n\r\n9. The party of Mr. H.B. Renwick having returned first, immediate\r\npreparations were made for descending the stream. Before they were\r\ncompleted Mr. Lally also came in, and both were assembled at Metis on\r\nthe 14th, whence the commissioner set out instantly for the river Du\r\nLoup, which had been chosen as the base of further operations.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the operations up the Metis and Metis and\r\nMistigougeche had been upon the whole favorable. With the exception of\r\na single thundershower, no rain had been experienced; the country was\r\nstill sufficiently moist to insure a supply of water even upon the\r\nridges. The sun was observed daily for time and latitude, and the nights\r\nadmitted of observations of the pole star for latitude at almost every\r\ncamp. At the stationary camp, however, the mists rising from the lake\r\nobscured the horizon and rendered the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites\r\ninvisible; nor was it possible to observe the only occultation of a star\r\nwhich calculation rendered probable during the period in question. Much,\r\nhowever, had been accomplished. A river little known had been carefully\r\nsurveyed some miles beyond its junction with a branch unheard of by\r\ngeographers. This branch had been explored, its course and length\r\ndetermined; a path nearly coinciding with the boundary line for an\r\nextent of 86 miles had been measured and leveled, and regions before\r\nunseen visited. One accident of a serious character had occurred, and\r\none of the laboring men, although an _homme du nord_, seasoned in the\r\nservice of the Hudsons Bay Company, had been rendered unfit by fatigue\r\nfor further duty in the service; but with these exceptions the health\r\nand strength of the party were unimpaired. All augured well for a speedy\r\nand successful completion of the task in a manner as perfect as had been\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\n10. Instructions had been transmitted to the commissary, as soon as it\r\nwas found that a portage to Katawamkedgwick and thence to Rimouski was\r\nimpracticable, to have a vessel ready at Metis to transport the stores\r\nto the river Du Loup. One was in consequence chartered, but, being\r\nneaped in the harbor of Rimouski, did not reach Metis till the 19th\r\nAugust. When loaded, her sailing was delayed by an unfavorable wind, and\r\nits continuance prevented her from reaching the river Du Loup before the\r\n29th August. An entire week of very favorable weather was thus lost for\r\nfield operations, and it was not even possible to employ it to advantage\r\nin observations, as all the chronometers but one and the larger\r\ninstruments, in order to expose them as little as possible to change of\r\nrate or injury, had been forwarded from Metis in the vessel. With the\r\none chronometer and the reflecting repeating circle numerous\r\nobservations were, however, made for the latitude of the river Du Loup.\r\n\r\n11. During the time the main body was engaged in ascending the Metis\r\nand in the other operations which have been mentioned an engineer was\r\ndirected to proceed from Metis along the Kempt road for the purpose of\r\nexploring along the dividing ridge between the waters of the Bay of\r\nChaleurs in the vicinity of Lake Matapediac and the St. Lawrence. This\r\nline forms the continuation of that claimed by the United States, and\r\nis important in its connection with the proclamation of 1763; but as it\r\nfalls without the ground which is the subject of dispute, it was not\r\nconsidered necessary to survey it. The heights which could be reached\r\nwere therefore measured with the barometer, and the position of the\r\npoints at which the observations were taken referred to existing maps\r\nwithout any attempt to correct their errors.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this reconnoissance an eminence 1,743 feet in height,\r\nlying to the southeast of Lake Matapediac, was ascended. Thence was had\r\nthe view of a wide, open valley extending toward the southeast to the\r\nBay of Chaleurs and bounded on the northeast and southwest by highlands.\r\nThe former were pointed out by the guide as the Chic Choc Mountains, in\r\nthe district of Gaspe; the latter, it appeared beyond question, extended\r\nto the Bay of Chaleurs, and strike it below the Matapediac. At the\r\nlatter place a party detached down the Restigouche in 1840 had measured\r\nthe height of Ben Lomond, a highland rising abruptly from the western\r\ntermination of the Bay of Chaleurs. and found it to be 1,024 feet. Thus\r\nit appears beyond the possibility of doubt that a chain of eminences\r\nwell entitled to the name of highlands, both as dividing waters and\r\nrising to the character of mountains, depart from \"_the northern shore\r\nof the Bay of Chaleurs at its western extremity_,\" bound the valley of\r\nthe Matapediac to the northeast, and, bending around the lake of that\r\nname, separate its waters from those of the Metis. These are deeply cut\r\nby valleys, whose direction appears from the map of the reconnoissance\r\nand from the course of the tributary streams which occupy their lines\r\nof maximum slope to run from southwest to northeast, or at right angles\r\nto the general course of the highlands themselves. These highlands are\r\nobviously those defined in the proclamation of 1763 and the commission\r\nof Governor Wilmot.\r\n\r\n12. As soon as the necessary instruments arrived from Metis at the river\r\nDu Loup a party was detached to survey the Temiscouata portage, a line\r\nknown to be of great importance to the subsequent operations, but whose\r\ninterest has been increased from the unexpected frequency with which the\r\nline dividing the waters touches or crosses it. Stores for a month's\r\nservice were transported with all possible dispatch to Lake Temiscouata,\r\nalong with the boats and camp equipage.\r\n\r\nTwo separate parties were now formed, the one to proceed up Temiscouata\r\nLake, the other to ascend the Tuladi. The embarkation of both was\r\ncompleted at noon on the 4th September.\r\n\r\n13. Mr. H.B. Renwick, with the party under his command, was directed\r\nif possible to ascend the middle or main branch of Tuladi and form a\r\nstationary camp at the highest point of that stream which could be\r\nreached by boats.\r\n\r\nMr. Lally had orders to enter and follow the river Asherbish, which\r\nenters Lake Temiscouata at its head, until the progress of his boats\r\nshould be interrupted. The first party was directed to operate in the\r\nfirst place toward the west, the second toward the east, upon the height\r\nof land until they should meet each other's marks. The party of Mr. H.B.\r\nRenwick was directed, therefore, to proceed from the head of Tuladi and\r\nreach if possible the head of Rimouski, thus forming a connection with\r\nthe line explored from the head of Mistigougeche; that of Mr. Lally to\r\nproceed from the head of Asherbish along the height of land to the\r\nTemiscouata portage. The commissary was then moved up with a large\r\namount of stores and halted on the summit of Mount Biort, to be within\r\nreach of both the parties in case of a demand for new supplies, and to\r\nreceive them on their return.\r\n\r\n14. The party of Mr. H.B. Renwick, having passed through Tuladi Lake,\r\nentered the main stream of that name on the 5th September. The head of\r\nit had been seen by that gentleman in September, 1840, and held out the\r\npromise of abundance of water for navigation. This promise did not\r\nfail, but it was found that the stream had probably never before been\r\nascended, and was therefore embarrassed with driftwood. After cutting\r\nthrough several rafts with great labor, a place was reached where the\r\nstream spread out to a great width over beds of gravel, and all further\r\nprogress in boats became impossible. It was therefore determined to fall\r\ndown the stream and ascend the western branch, well known under the\r\nname of Abagusquash, and which had been fully explored in 1840. The\r\nresolution to return was taken on the 6th, and on the evening of the\r\n9th the beaver pond at the head of Abagusquash was reached; here a\r\nstationary camp was established. One of the men had wounded himself with\r\nan ax and three more were so ill as to be unfit for service. The numbers\r\nwere yet sufficient for short expeditions, and one was immediately\r\nfitted out for the head of Tuladi with provisions to form a cache for\r\nfuture operations. This expedition explored so much of the height of\r\nland as would otherwise have been thrown out of the regular order in\r\nconsequence of the failure to ascend the main branch of Tuladi.\r\n\r\n15. In the meantime Mr. Lally proceeded up Lake Temiscouata and entered\r\nthe Asherbish. This stream was also found very difficult, and on the\r\nevening of the 7th no more than 7 miles had been accomplished on it.\r\nAt this point a stationary camp was fixed and a detachment sent out to\r\nexplore the neighborhood. On the 10th Mr. Lally set out to the eastward,\r\nand struck the lower end of Abagusquash Lake on the afternoon of the\r\n11th September. Being obviously too far to the south, he ascended that\r\nstream and reached H.B. Renwick's camp on the evening of the 12th.\r\nThe next morning he proceeded to the height of land, and after twice\r\ncrossing it reached his stationary camp on Asherbish at noon on the\r\n21st September.\r\n\r\nOn this expedition two out of three barometers were broken, and an\r\nassistant was therefore sent to seek a fresh supply from the stores.\r\n\r\n16. The expedition sent out by H.B. Renwick to the head of the Tuladi\r\nreturned on the 13th September. One of the men came in severely wounded,\r\nand those left sick and wounded in camp were still unfit for service;\r\nothers also were taken sick. Of the laborers of the party, one-half were\r\nthus lost for the present to the service. The engineer in command,\r\nwho had finished the observations for which he had remained in the\r\nstationary camp, determined, therefore, to proceed to Mount Biort in\r\norder to obtain men. Previous to his departure on the 15th September he\r\nfitted out a second expedition with all the disposable strength for the\r\npurpose of operating between the head of Tuladi and the point in the\r\nheight of land where Mr. Lally's line diverged to the southwest. The\r\nnewly engaged hands and the detachment on its return both reached the\r\ncamp on the Abagusquash on the 19th of September. On the 21st, all\r\narrangements having been completed, Mr. H.B. Renwick, leaving the\r\nassistant commissary with only one man in the stationary camp, set off\r\ntoward the head of Rimouski. This course was pursued for six days, when\r\nit became necessary to return for want of provisions, and the stationary\r\ncamp was reached on the 2d October. On this expedition the line of\r\nexploration made in June up the Rimouski was intersected and the ground\r\ntraversed in July and August seen and connected with the survey, but\r\nit was found impossible to penetrate along the height of land on the\r\nwestern side of Rimouski to its head. On reaching the camp snow began\r\nto fall, and the thermometer marked 18° in the morning. All further\r\noperations for the season in this direction were therefore at an end.\r\nA portion of the line which divides the waters falling into the St.\r\nJohn from those falling into the St. Lawrence remained in consequence\r\nunsurveyed. It can not, however, be said to be absolutely unexplored,\r\nfor it was seen from the eastern side of Rimouski, presenting the\r\nappearance of a range of hills at least as elevated as any on the\r\nboundary.\r\n\r\n18. Mr. Lally having received a fresh supply of barometers on the\r\nevening of the 23d, resumed his survey of the height of land on the 25th\r\nSeptember, and reached the camp of the commissary on Mount Biort on the\r\n2d October, having surveyed and leveled the intermediate dividing ridge.\r\nThe party of H.B. Renwick descended the Abagusquash and Tuladi, and,\r\ncrossing Lake Temiscouata, reached the same rendezvous on the 5th\r\nOctober. The interval was spent by Mr. Lally's party in clearing a space\r\nfor a panoramic view on the summit of Mount Biort.\r\n\r\n19. The commissioner, having superintended in person the equipment and\r\nembarkation of the parties of Messrs. H.B. Renwick and Lally on Lake\r\nTemiscouata, returned to the river Du Loup for the purpose of making\r\nastronomic observations. These being completed, he visited and conferred\r\nwith the parties of his colleague, A. Talcott, esq., on their way to the\r\nheight of land southeast of Kamouraska. Here he made arrangements for\r\nthe junction of the two lines on the Temiscouata portage. He then\r\nproceeded to the camp of the commissary on Mount Biort, and there made\r\nprovision for the completion of the residue of the line in the vicinity\r\nof the portage. He also selected points of view for the use of the\r\ndaguerreotype and camera lucida, and, being unable to do any more on the\r\nground for the furtherance of the objects of his appointment, returned\r\nto New York, taking with him the earlier records of the field operations\r\nfor the purpose of organizing the office work.\r\n\r\n20. Under the direction of Mr. H.B. Renwick, a party led by Mr. Lally\r\nset off from Mount Biort on the 7th October, and, proceeding westward\r\nalong the portage road to the ridge of Mount Paradis, turned to the\r\nsouth along the dividing ridge. This being pursued led them back to the\r\nportage at a point about 21-1/2 miles from the river Du Loup on the\r\n10th. The dividing ridge was now found for some distance to coincide\r\nnearly with the portage road and to pass over the summit of the Grande\r\nFourche Mountain, a fact which had not before been suspected. The source\r\nof the Grande Fourche of Trois Pistoles having been headed, the party\r\nreached a station which the commissary had now established at the river\r\nSt. Francis on the 13th October. Departing from this, the basin of the\r\nSt. Francis to the north of the portage road was explored, and the\r\nsurvey finished on the 17th October.\r\n\r\nOperating from the St. Lawrence as a base, and within reach of a\r\ncultivated country, whence numerous roads are cut to the height of\r\nland, it would have been possible to have kept the field for perhaps a\r\nfortnight longer. The plans and estimates of the division had been made\r\nwith this view, and it was anticipated that the height of land might\r\nhave been surveyed 30 miles to the south of the Temiscouata portage.\r\nAlthough this would have been practicable, it would have been a service\r\nof hardship. The necessity for this was obviated by the progress of the\r\nparties of A. Talcott, esq., which completed their surveys up to the\r\nportage on the same day that the surveys of this division were finished.\r\n\r\n22. The circumstances under which the latter part of the survey was\r\nperformed from the time of leaving the river Du Loup, on the 3d\r\nSeptember, were far less favorable than had been experienced on the\r\nMetis and its branches. The continual drought had at the beginning of\r\nthis part of the duty affected the streams and springs in such a way\r\nas to render navigation difficult and water for drinking scarce on the\r\nheights of land to which the survey was necessarily directed. On the\r\neastern side of Lake Temiscouata a large fire had extended itself into\r\nthe woods. On the Temiscouata portage the persons in charge of that road\r\nhad set fire to the brush and wood cut in opening it out to an increased\r\nbreadth, and a belt of flame 30 miles in length was at each change of\r\nwind carried in some new direction into the dry forest. The camp and\r\ncollection of stores on Mount Biort were thus threatened for several\r\ndays, and only saved by great exertions. Serious apprehensions were\r\nentertained lest the return of the parties in the field might be\r\nobstructed by the spreading of their own fires. The smoke of this vast\r\nextent of combustion obscured the heavens and rendered astronomic\r\nobservations difficult or prevented it altogether. Finally, a season of\r\nunprecedented drought was closed on the 24th of September by the setting\r\nin of the equinoctial storm, and from this day until that on which the\r\nsurvey terminated few hours elapsed without rain, sleet, or snow. In\r\nspite of these obstacles, it is believed that the State Department will\r\nhave no reason to be dissatisfied with the results of the campaign.\r\n\r\n23. The results of the operations of this division are embodied in a map\r\nand profiles, which are herewith presented. The degree of reliance to be\r\nplaced on this map will be best understood from a detail of the methods\r\nemployed in preparing it.\r\n\r\nThe river Metis and its branch, the Mistigougeche, were surveyed by an\r\nazimuth compass of Smallcaldus construction, and the distances measured\r\nby a micrometric telescope by Ertil, of Munich. The courses of the rest\r\nof the lines were determined by compasses of similar construction, and\r\nthe distances measured by chains of 100 feet constructed by Dollond, of\r\nLondon, and Brown, of New York. An exception to this general rule exists\r\nin the survey of the eastern side of Rimouski. The courses and distances\r\nthus measured, and corrected for the variation of the compass, were\r\ncompared with astronomic observations for latitude and with longitudes\r\ndeduced from chronometers. For this reason, as the line on the east side\r\nof Rimouski is almost in the direction of the meridian, it was not\r\nconsidered necessary to lose time in measuring it when the latitude of\r\nthe several camps, determined by observations of the pole star, were\r\ntaken nightly.\r\n\r\nThe latitudes of the courses under the direction of Mr. H.B. Renwick\r\nwere determined by a reflecting repeating circle of Dollond; those on\r\nMr. Lally's by a good sextant. The latitudes and times at Grand Metis,\r\nthe river Du Loup, and the stationary camp on Mistigougeche and\r\nAbagusquash were principally determined from observations made with the\r\nDollond circle. Lunar transits were taken at the river Du Loup, and\r\ndistances of the moon for longitude at several places on the line. The\r\nreliance for the longitudes was, however, principally upon timekeepers,\r\nand of these the party was furnished with one box and two pocket\r\nchronometers by Parkinson & Trodsham, one pocket chronometer by\r\nMolyneux, one by French, one by Barraud, and one by Morrice. Thus, while\r\nseveral could be retained at the station, each party in the field was\r\nfurnished with two, and the measured distance furnished a check, which,\r\nin case of discrepancy, that on which greatest reliance could be placed\r\nmight be ascertained. It is sufficient to say that the deductions have\r\nbeen in general satisfactory, although the rough motion to which\r\nthese instruments were subjected in passing through pathless woods,\r\nembarrassed by fallen trees and morasses in which the bearers often\r\nsunk to the middle, caused changes of rate and even sudden variations.\r\nUncertainty arising from these causes was rendered less to be dreaded\r\nfrom its being possible to refer, as a base of operations, to the\r\nexcellent survey of the St. Lawrence River by Captain Byfield, of the\r\nBritish navy. With the geographical positions given in his charts our\r\nown observations agreed so closely as materially to confirm the\r\nrespective accuracy of both.\r\n\r\n24. The point which in this part of the survey has been kept in view as\r\nmost important is the determination of the heights. For this purpose the\r\nparty of Professor Renwick was furnished with the following barometers:\r\n\r\nTwo loaned by the Superintendent of the Coast Survey, of his own\r\nconstruction; two portable and one standard, by Neurnan; three of the\r\nsiphon form, by Buntin, of Paris; one by Traughton & Simms; one by\r\nForlin, of Paris; three of siphon form, by Roach & Warner, of New York;\r\ntwo by Tagliabue, of New York, originally on the plan of Durand, but\r\nwhich had been advantageously altered by Roach & Warner in such manner\r\nas to admit of the adjustment of the level of the mercury in the\r\ncistern.\r\n\r\nThe stations at which the lower barometers were placed were Grand Metis\r\nuntil the return of the expedition up the river of that name, and the\r\nriver Du Loup from that time until the close of the survey. At these\r\nplaces all the barometers not actually in the field were suspended and\r\nregistered at the hours most likely to correspond with the observations\r\nof a traveling party, say at 6, 7, 8, and 9 in the morning, noon, 1, 5,\r\nand 6 in the afternoon, until as the season advanced and the days became\r\nshort the earliest and latest of these hours were omitted. Although\r\nseveral barometers were thus constantly observed, no other use of these\r\nwas made but to determine their comparisons with each other, except one\r\nof the barometers of Mr. Hassler, Superintendent of the Coast Survey.\r\nThis, from its superior simplicity, being, in fact, no more than the\r\noriginal Tonicillean experiment, with a well-divided scale and\r\nadjustment of its 0° to the surface of the mercury in the cistern, was\r\nfound to be most certain in its results. All the barometers used by the\r\nparties in the field were therefore reduced to this by their mean\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\nThe stations at the two above-mentioned places were near the St.\r\nLawrence. At Metis the height of the cistern of the standard barometer\r\nwas determined by a spirit level. At the river Du Loup the height of the\r\nstation was determined by two sets of observations of barometers, taken\r\nwith different instruments by different observers, and at an interval of\r\na week from each other. The results of the two several sets, which were\r\ncalculated separately, differ no more than 0.5 of a foot from each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the highest accessible points of the streams on which the\r\nparties proceeded toward the height of land, stationary camps were\r\nestablished, as has been already stated. At these series of observations\r\nwere made at the same hours as at the river stations. The height of\r\nthe former was then calculated from a series of observations taken at\r\nnoon and at 1 p.m. for the whole of the time the camp was occupied.\r\nThe heights of the points at which observations were made by the\r\ntraveling party were then deduced from a comparison with the nearest\r\ncontemporaneous observations at the stationary camp. An exception to\r\nthis rule was made in the observations to the westward of Temiscouata\r\nLake, which were referred directly to those made at the river Du Loup,\r\nwhich was sufficiently near for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe height of the stationary camp at Mount Biort having been determined\r\nby observations continued for several days, the level of Lake\r\nTemiscouata was thence determined by using a set of levels taken with a\r\ntheodolite by Breithaupt, of Cassel, in 1840. The height of the lake\r\nthus deduced is greater than it would appear to be from the barometric\r\nobservations taken in December, 1840. It had been imagined that a\r\ndifference in level might exist between the St. Lawrence at Metis and\r\nat the river Du Loup. Four days of contemporaneous observations were\r\ntherefore made at each with a view to the solution of this question.\r\nThe idea of a difference of level was not sustained by the operation.\r\n\r\nThe heights of the river stations were measured in each case to the\r\nhighest mark left by spring tides, and half the fall of that tide as\r\ngiven by Captain Byfield has been added in all cases as a reduction to\r\nthe mean level of the sea. Opportunities were offered in a few instances\r\nfor testing the accuracy of the method by different barometers used by\r\ndifferent observers at different days on the same point. No discrepancy\r\ngreater than 7 feet has been thus discovered. In other cases the same\r\nobserver returned and observed at the same places, and here a similar\r\ncongruity of result has been found to exist.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the calculations have been made by the formulae and tables\r\nof Bailey. Before adopting these their results were compared in one\r\nor two instances with those of a more exact formula. The differences,\r\nhowever, were found so small as to be of no importance, amounting in the\r\nheight of Lake Johnson to no more than 5 feet in 1,007. The original\r\nrecord of the barometric observations, each verified by the initials of\r\nthe observer, have been deposited in the State Department.\r\n\r\n25. The paths pursued by the traveling parties were marked by blazing\r\ntrees. The position of the barometer at each place of observation was\r\nalso marked. The operation was a search for the boundary line in an\r\nunknown country, hence it rarely happened that the path of the parties\r\nhas pursued the exact dividing line of the waters of the St. Lawrence\r\nand the Atlantic, but has been continually crossing it. The maps\r\nherewith submitted and the marks by which the line of the survey has\r\nbeen perpetuated would have enabled a party sent out for that especial\r\npurpose to trace the boundary on the ground without difficulty other\r\nthan that arising from the inacessible character of the country.\r\n\r\n26. The commissioner can not speak in too high terms of the industry and\r\nperseverance manifested by the engineers and surveyors employed on this\r\ndivision, and in particular of the skill and intelligence of the two\r\nfirst assistants. Circumstances had prevented the receipt of portable\r\nastronomic instruments which had been ordered from Paris and Munich, and\r\nan instrument formed by the adaptation of a vertical circle to the lower\r\npart of an excellent German theodolite by Draper, of Philadelphia, was\r\nfound on its being opened at Metis to have received an injury which\r\nrendered its accuracy doubtful. The whole reliance for the greatest\r\naccuracy was thus thrown on the repeating circle of Dollond. Such,\r\nhowever, was the address and skill of the engineer to whom it was\r\nintrusted that he not only fulfilled the object for which it was\r\nintended, of determining the position of the points visited by the\r\ntraveling parties, but accomplished the same object at the stationary\r\ncamps and at the river stations, without delaying for an hour the\r\noperations of the survey.\r\n\r\nThe duty which these gentlemen performed was arduous in the extreme. It\r\nhas been seen that on the expedition up the Metis a seasoned voyageur\r\nhad been worn out by the severity of his labors; on the Tuladi half the\r\nmen were sick at a time; and of Mr. Rally's party two Penobscot Indians\r\nof herculean frame were compelled to return by extreme fatigue. The\r\nengineers, while in the field, were even more exposed to fatigue than\r\nthe laborers, for they carried their own baggage and instruments, and\r\nwere engaged nightly in observation and calculation, while the workmen\r\ncould repose.\r\n\r\n27. The commissioner to whom the survey of the northern division of the\r\nboundary line was intrusted has to express his acknowledgments for the\r\npoliteness and good offices of the authorities of Her Britannic Majesty.\r\nIn compliance with his request, permission was granted by the late\r\nlamented Governor-General for the admission of a vessel and the entry of\r\nthe stores, camp equipage, and instruments of the party at one or more\r\nports on the St. Lawrence. Letters were addressed by the principal\r\nsecretary of the colony of Canada to all the officers and magistrates,\r\ndirecting them to give every facility to the operations, and these\r\ndirections were obeyed, not as mere matters of form, but with a truly\r\nhospitable spirit. To the officers of the Sixty-eighth Regiment, forming\r\nthe garrison of Fort Ingall and occupying the post of the river Du Loup,\r\nas well as to the officers of the commissariat on duty at those places,\r\nacknowledgments are due for numerous attentions.\r\n\r\nII.--_Operations of the year 1842_.\r\n\r\n1. Of the task originally assigned in the instructions for this division\r\nthere remained to be completed--\r\n\r\n(1) A portion of the boundary claimed by the United States around the\r\nhead waters of the river Rimouski.\r\n\r\n(2) The line of highlands forming the south bounds of the Province of\r\nQuebec, extending from the north shore of the Bay of Chaleurs at its\r\nwestern extremity.\r\n\r\n2. Experience had shown that the portion of the boundary which remained\r\nunsurveyed could not be reached with any hope of completing the survey\r\nby any of the streams running into the St. Lawrence nor from the waters\r\nof Lake Temiscouata. The Green River (of St. John) was therefore chosen\r\nas the line of operation. It was known that a portage existed between\r\nits boatable waters and those of the Grande Fourche of Restigouche. The\r\nplan for the work of the season was therefore laid as follows:\r\n\r\nTo proceed up Green River with a party, thence to cross to the Bell\r\nKedgwick by the portage, and having, by expeditions from the banks of\r\nthat stream, surveyed the remainder of the claimed boundary, to fall\r\ndown the stream to the Bay of Chaleurs, and, ascending the highland\r\nmeasured in 1840, to proceed along the heights in order to reach if\r\npossible the northwest angle of Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\nThe work being the most remote and difficult of access of any on the\r\nwhole boundary, it was necessary to take measures early, and, it being\r\napparent that if they were not vigorously pressed the whole summer's\r\nwork would be frustrated, permission was granted by the Secretary of\r\nState to prepare stores and provisions, and the party was sent forward\r\ntoward its line of operations. Care was, however, taken, in conformity\r\nwith his instructions, to secure means of communication.\r\n\r\n3. The transportation of stores, equipage, and instruments was rendered\r\nunexpectedly easy by a steamboat running from Portland to St. John, and\r\nby the politeness of the British consul at Portland and the collector of\r\nHer Britannic Majesty's customs at St. John free entrance was permitted\r\nat the latter port. These articles were shipped from Portland the 19th\r\nof June and under the charge of the Hon. Albert Smith reached the Grand\r\nFalls of St. John July ----.\r\n\r\n4. Mr. Lally, first assistant engineer, with the surveyor, was\r\ndispatched by the way of Bangor and Houlton to the same point of\r\nrendezvous on 18th June for the purpose of procuring boats and engaging\r\nlaborers. Mr. H.B. Renwick, first assistant, with Mr. F. Smith, second\r\nassistant, were placed in charge of the chronometers and the necessary\r\nastronomic instruments, with instructions to observe on the meridian\r\nof the St. Croix at Houlton, and again at its intersection with the\r\nriver St. John, for the purpose of ascertaining the rate taken by\r\nthe chronometers when carried. These preliminary operations being\r\nsuccessfully performed, the party was completely organized at the Grand\r\nFalls of the St. John on the 2d July. The energy and activity of the\r\npersons intrusted with these several duties was such that this date of\r\ncomplete preparation for the field duties was at least a week earlier\r\nthan any calculation founded on the experience of former years rendered\r\nprobable. The commissioner, advised of the negotiation in progress, had\r\nmade his arrangements to reach the Grand Falls of the St. John on the\r\n10th July. Being directed by the State Department to remain in New York,\r\nhe sent orders by mail to the party to halt until further instructions.\r\n\r\n5. These orders were not received, for the party, being fully organized,\r\nleft the Grand Falls in three different detachments on the 4th, 6th,\r\nand 8th of July. The first detachment was composed of the surveyor,\r\nMr. Bell, and an engineer having instructions to make a survey of Green\r\nRiver. The second was in charge of the assistant commissary, and was\r\ncomposed of three bateaux and fourteen pirogues, carrying stores and\r\nequipage for three months' service. The third was formed by the two\r\nfirst assistants, who, after performing the necessary astronomic\r\nobservations at the Grand Falls and at two points on Green River, passed\r\nthe surveying party and reached the portage between Green and Kedgwick\r\nrivers on the evening of the 13th July.\r\n\r\n6. Green River has a fall and rapids near its junction with the St.\r\nJohn, which are passed by a portage of 1-1/2 miles. At 15 miles from its\r\nmouth is a second fall, which is passed by a portage of 82 yards. The\r\nstream for this distance and for 5 miles above the second fall is very\r\nrapid, its bed being in some reaches almost filled with rocks. For the\r\nnext 10 miles it has deep still reaches, alternating with gravel beds,\r\nor else the river flows over ledges of rock. It is then interrupted by a\r\nthird fall, requiring a portage of 176 yards. Thence to the second fork\r\nof the lakes it has the same character as for the last 10 miles, except\r\nthat in some places it flows with a gentle current between low banks\r\ncovered with alder. From the second fork of the lakes to the southern\r\nend of the Green River and Kedgwick portage the stream is very narrow\r\nand may be styled one continuous rapid. It is upon the whole the most\r\ndifficult of navigation of all the streams running into the St. John\r\nfrom its northern side, and approaches in its character of a torrent\r\nto the waters on the St. Lawrence side of the highlands.\r\n\r\n7. The portage from Green River to the South Branch of Kedgwick is 5-1/4\r\nmiles in length, and passes over the summits of two of the highest\r\nmountains in the ceded district, as well as several ridges. No vessel\r\nheavier than a birch canoe had ever before been carried over it. It\r\ntherefore became necessary to clear it out before the bateaux and other\r\nheavy articles could be transported. Fifteen extra laborers, who had\r\nbeen engaged, with their pirogues, to carry some of the stores from the\r\nSt. John, were retained to aid in making this portage, which swelled the\r\nnumber to twenty-seven. This large force was industriously engaged for\r\neight days in carrying the stores and equipage over the portage, with\r\nthe boats and canoes required for the future operations of the party.\r\nIn the meantime the portage was surveyed, and a great number of\r\nobservations were made, by which the latitude of the southern end of the\r\nportage and its difference in longitude from that of the meridian line\r\nwere determined with great accuracy. In addition to the other labors of\r\nthe party, a storehouse and observatory were erected.\r\n\r\n8. The commissioner, learning that the party had left the Grand Falls\r\nbefore his letter could have reached that place, addressed fresh orders\r\nto the engineer in command. These were sent under cover to the British\r\npostmaster at Lake Temiscouata, who was requested to send them up Green\r\nRiver by an express. By these he was directed to stop the progress of\r\nthe party and to proceed himself to the river Du Loup, there to await\r\nfresh instructions.\r\n\r\nThese orders did not arrive in time to prevent the party intended for\r\nthe survey of the boundary from setting out. The engineer who had\r\nhitherto been in command returned to the St. John in pursuance of his\r\noriginal instructions and met the express on his way down Green River.\r\nThe commissioner, being advised on the 13th July that the treaty had\r\nbeen signed, immediately dispatched a special messenger, who joined the\r\nchief of the division at the mouth of Green River on the 24th July.\r\nMeasures were now taken for the recall and return of the party in the\r\nwoods, and the whole division was assembled at the stationary camp at\r\nthe north end of the portage on the 11th of August.\r\n\r\n9. The party engaged in the survey of the remaining part of the boundary\r\nline had before the orders of recall reached them successfully\r\naccomplished that duty, having connected their survey with points in the\r\nsurvey of the previous year and thoroughly explored the culminating\r\npoints of the valley of Rimouski. As had been anticipated from the level\r\nof the streams seen in 1841, this portion of the boundary claimed by the\r\nUnited States is more elevated than any other portion of that line\r\nbetween the Temiscouata portage and the northwest angle of Nova Scotia.\r\nThis survey would therefore have added an important link to the argument\r\nof the United States had not the question been settled by treaty.\r\n\r\nThe party having received its orders of recall, all the articles of\r\nequipment which could not be carried in the boats which had been\r\nlaunched on the waters of the Restigouche were transported to the other\r\nend of the portage and embarked in pirogues sent up Green River for that\r\npurpose under the direction of the assistant commissary. The engineers\r\nthen set out on their return by the Bell Kedgwick, the Grande Fourche,\r\nand the Southwest Branch of Restigouche. Ascending the latter stream,\r\nthis party reached the Wagansis portage on the 21st August, and arrived\r\nat the Grand Falls on the 25th August.\r\n\r\nThe descent of the Bell Kedgwick was attended with great difficulties\r\nin consequence of the low state of the waters. Until its junction with\r\nKatawamkedgwick, to form the Grande Fourche of Restigouche, it was\r\nnecessary to drag the boats by hand.\r\n\r\n10. The detailed map of the surveys of this division, exhibiting the\r\nmore important points whose altitudes were determined by the barometer,\r\nhas already been lodged in the Department of State under date of 27th\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\nAlthough the interest of this survey to the United States has now passed\r\naway, yet, as it is probable that many years may elapse before this\r\ncountry shall be again explored, and as it may still possess some\r\ninterest to the nation into whose undisputed possession it has now\r\nfallen, it may not be improper to state the methods employed in the\r\nsurvey, for the purpose of showing to what degree of faith it is\r\nentitled.\r\n\r\nThe latitude and longitude of the mouth of Green River were furnished by\r\nMajor Graham. The three portages on that river were surveyed by chain\r\nand compass. The courses on the navigable parts of the river were taken\r\nwith a compass and the distances measured by a micrometrical telescope\r\nby Ertil, of Munich. This instrument, which had given satisfactory\r\nresults on Metis and Mistigougeche in 1841, was still more accurate\r\nin the present survey. The latitude of the south end of the Kedgwick\r\nportage as given by the plot of Green River on the original projection\r\ndiffered no more than 5\" from that given by numerous astronomic\r\nobservations, an agreement so close that it might be almost considered\r\nas arising from happy accident. This survey therefore required but\r\nlittle correction, which was applied from the observations already cited\r\nand from those at two intermediate points.\r\n\r\nThe survey of Kedgwick portage was performed with chain and compass. In\r\nthe woods between the Bell Kedgwick and the boundary and along the whole\r\nline of survey the same method was used, observations for time and\r\nlatitude being also taken whenever the weather permitted. As the lines\r\nintersected those of the last year, it can now be stated that every part\r\nof the boundary claimed by the United States, from the height of land on\r\nthe Temiscouata portage which divides the waters of the Green River of\r\nthe St. Lawrence from those of the St. Francis to the northwest angle of\r\nNova Scotia, as well as its connections with the St. Lawrence and Lake\r\nTemiscouata by the Temiscouata portage, and with the St. Lawrence a\r\nsecond time by the Metis and Mistigougeche, and with the St. John by\r\nGreen River, has been actually surveyed. This result is one that neither\r\nthe Department in its original instructions nor the commissioner on\r\nhis first view of the country had contemplated. In stating this the\r\ncommissioner feels it his duty to acknowledge his obligations to the\r\nuntiring zeal and energy of the gentlemen who have acted under his\r\norders, and especially to his two first assistants, who, entering upon\r\nduties of an entirely novel character, not only to themselves, but\r\nto the country, have in the course of the operations of two years\r\naccumulated under the most disadvantageous circumstances a stock of\r\nobservations which for number and accuracy may compare with those taken\r\nwith every convenience at hand by the most practiced astronomers.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the latitude of numerous points determined astronomically\r\nby the party engaged in surveying the line through the woods, the\r\nlatitude of a point near the southern end of Green River and Kedgwick\r\nhas been determined by eighty-six altitudes of sun and stars taken with\r\na repeating and reflecting circle.\r\n\r\nThe whole number of altitudes of sun and stars taken during the\r\nexpedition for time and latitude was 806.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n1. The operations of this division during the three seasons which it has\r\nbeen engaged in field duties have given a view of nearly every part of\r\nthe country which has now been ceded to Great Britain to the north of\r\nthe St. John River and the Temiscouata portage. During the year 1840\r\nthe commissioner proceeded in person by the wagansis of Grand River to\r\nthe waters of the Bay of Chaleurs, ascended the Grande Fourche of the\r\nRestigouche to Lake Kedgwick, and then traversed the country from that\r\nlake to the Tuladi by a route never before explored. In 1841 the\r\nRimouski and Metis were both ascended--the first to the limits of its\r\nnavigation by canoes, the latter to the lake in which the waters of its\r\nwestern branch are first collected. From this lake lines of survey\r\nrepeatedly crossing the boundary claimed by the United States were\r\nextended to a great distance in both directions. The operations of the\r\nyear were closed by a survey of so much of the boundary as incloses\r\nthe basin of Lake Temiscouata and intersects so frequently the great\r\nportage. These latter surveys covered in some degree the explorations\r\nof one of the parties in 1840, which, therefore, are not quoted as a\r\npart of the work of that year. In 1842 the valley of Green River was\r\nexplored, that stream was carefully surveyed, and the remainder of the\r\nboundary line dividing the sources of Rimouski from those of Green River\r\nand the eastern branches of Tuladi run out with chain and compass.\r\n\r\nIn these surveys and explorations the character of the country, its\r\nsoil, climate, and natural productions, have been thoroughly examined,\r\nand may be stated with full confidence in the accuracy of the facts.\r\n\r\n2. Beginning on the southern side of the ceded territory, the left bank\r\nof the St. John is for a few miles above the Grand Falls uncultivated\r\nand apparently barren. Thence to the confluence of the Madawaska it\r\npresents a continued settlement upon land of good quality, producing\r\nlarge crops of potatoes and grass. It also yields wheat, oats, and\r\nbarley, but the crops are neither abundant nor certain. The Madawaska\r\nRiver presents but few attempts at settlement on either of its banks.\r\nIts left bank is represented to be generally barren, but some good\r\nland is said to exist on its southwestern side. The shores of Lake\r\nTemiscouata are either rocky or composed of a light, gravelly soil,\r\nwhich is so poor that it will not repay the labor of cultivation, even\r\nwhen newly cleared, without the aid of manure. Some tolerable meadows\r\nare found, which are at the moment highly valued in consequence of a\r\ndemand for forage by the British troops. The valley of Green River has\r\nin some places upon its banks intervals of level alluvium which might be\r\nimproved as meadows, and it has been represented as being in general\r\nfertile. A close examination has not confirmed this impression.\r\n\r\nMr. Lally reports that--\r\n\r\n\"In the valley of Green River there are some tracts of land capable\r\nof cultivation, but the greater portion of it is a hard, rocky soil,\r\ncovered with a growth of poplar and trees of that description. Some\r\nof the most desirable spots for farms had been formerly taken up by\r\nsettlers from the Madawaska settlement, but although the land is as\r\ngood as that on the river St. John, they were obliged to abandon their\r\nclearings on account of the early frosts and the black flies. It can\r\nhardly be conceived that the latter would be a sufficient cause for\r\nleaving valuable land to waste, but such is the fact, as I have been\r\ninformed by some of those who made the attempt to settle, and I can\r\nwell believe it from my own experience there.\"\r\n\r\n3. The explorations of 1840, in which the ground lying between the\r\nwestern sources of Green River and Squattuck, a branch of Tuladi, was\r\ntraversed, showed a considerable extent of better land than any other in\r\nthe ceded territory. The commissioner traveled for a part of two days\r\nalong a table-land of no great elevation, covered with rock, maple, and\r\na thick undergrowth of moosewood, both said to be signs of good soil;\r\nof this there may be from seven to ten thousand acres, and it is a far\r\nlarger body of tillable land than is to be found in any other part of\r\nthe country north of the settlements on the St. John.\r\n\r\n4. By far the greater portion of the territory in question is composed\r\nof the highlands in which the streams that flow to the St. Lawrence and\r\nthe Atlantic take their rise. With but three exceptions no part of this\r\nis less than 1,000 feet above the level of the sea. It is a perfect\r\nlabyrinth of small lakes, cedar and alder swamps, and ridges covered\r\nwith a thick but small growth of fir and spruce, or, more rarely, of\r\nbirch. No portion of it appears to be fit for tillage.\r\n\r\n5. In respect to timber, it was found that the pine, the only tree\r\nconsidered of any value, ceased to grow in rising from the St. Lawrence\r\nat less than 1,000 feet above the level of the sea. Only one extensive\r\ntract of pine was seen by any of the parties; this lies around the\r\nsources of the St. Francis, and may cover three or four thousand acres.\r\nThis river, however, discharges itself from Lake St. Francis through a\r\nbed of bowlders, and is sometimes wholly lost to the view. This tract,\r\ntherefore, although repeatedly examined by the proprietors of sawmills\r\non the St. Lawrence and the St. John, has been hitherto found\r\ninaccessible. The pine timber on the seigniory of Temiscouata has been\r\nin a great degree cut off or burnt by fires in the woods. There is still\r\nsome timber on the waters of Squattuck, but it has been diminished by\r\ntwo or three years of active lumbering, while that around Tuladi, if it\r\nwere ever abundant, has disappeared. It would, however, appear from\r\nreport that on the waters of the North Branch of Restigouche to the\r\neastward of the exploring meridian there is some valuable timber. This\r\nis the only portion of the district which has not been explored.\r\n\r\n6. As to the valley of Green River, the engineer who has already been\r\nquoted reports as follows:\r\n\r\n\"This river has had the reputation of having on it large quantities of\r\npine timber, but as far as I have been able to judge it is small and\r\nrather sparsely scattered along the slopes of the ridges. Above the\r\nthird falls of the river, which are rather more than 30 miles from its\r\nmouth, there is scarcely any to be seen. Some of the Madawaska settlers,\r\nwho have explored nearly every tributary of the river, report that there\r\nis good timber on some of them. Judging from the language that they used\r\nin relation to some that I saw myself, I infer that what they call good\r\nwould not be so considered by the lumbermen of the Penobscot. The people\r\nwho lumber in this vicinity do it on a small scale when compared with\r\nthe operators in Maine. They rarely use more than two horses to draw\r\ntheir lumber to the stream, so that a tract which would not afford more\r\nthan a month's work to an extensive operator would keep one of these\r\npeople employed for years.\"\r\n\r\n7. As respects climate, the country would be considered unfit for\r\nhabitation by those accustomed to the climates even of the southern\r\nparts of Maine and of New Hampshire. Frosts continue on the St. John\r\nuntil late in May, and set in early in September. In 1840 ice was found\r\non the Grand River on the 12th of that month, and snow fell in the first\r\nweek of October on Lake Temiscouata. In the highland region during the\r\nlast week of July, although the thermometer rose above 80°, and was once\r\nabove 90°, white frost was formed every clear night. Upon the whole,\r\ntherefore, it may be concluded that there is little in this country\r\ncalculated to attract either settlers or speculators in lumber. The\r\nformer were driven to it under circumstances of peculiar hardship and\r\nof almost paramount necessity. Their industry and perseverance under\r\nadverse circumstances is remarkable, but they would have been hardly\r\nable to overcome them had not the very question of the disputed boundary\r\nled to an expenditure of considerable money among them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGE.[93]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: Pocket veto.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 14, 1842_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nTwo bills were presented to me at the last session of Congress, which\r\noriginated in the House of Representatives, neither of which was signed\r\nby me; and both having been presented within ten days of the close of\r\nthe session, neither has become a law.\r\n\r\nThe first of these was a bill entitled \"An act to repeal the proviso of\r\nthe sixth section of the act entitled 'An act to appropriate the\r\nproceeds of the sales of the public lands and to grant preemption\r\nrights,' approved September 4, 1841.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill was presented to me on Tuesday, the 30th August, at\r\ntwenty-four minutes after 4 o'clock in the afternoon. For my opinions\r\nrelative to the provisions contained in this bill it is only necessary\r\nthat I should refer to previous communications made by me to the House\r\nof Representatives.\r\n\r\nThe other bill was entitled \"An act regulating the taking of testimony\r\nin cases of contested elections, and for other purposes.\" This bill was\r\npresented to me at a quarter past 1 o'clock on Wednesday, the 31st day\r\nof August. The two Houses, by concurrent vote, had already agreed to\r\nterminate the session by adjournment at 2 o'clock on that day--that is\r\nto say, within three-quarters of an hour from the time the bill was\r\nplaced in my hands. It was a bill containing twenty-seven sections, and,\r\nI need not say, of an important nature.\r\n\r\nOn its presentment to me its reading was immediately commenced, but was\r\ninterrupted by so many communications from the Senate and so many other\r\ncauses operating at the last hour of the session that it was impossible\r\nto read the bill understandingly and with proper deliberation before the\r\nhour fixed for the adjournment of the two Houses; and this, I presume,\r\nis a sufficient reason for neither signing the bill nor returning it\r\nwith my objections.\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth joint rule of the two Houses of Congress declares\r\nthat \"no bill or resolution that shall have passed the House of\r\nRepresentatives and the Senate shall be presented to the President of\r\nthe United States for his approbation on the last day of the session.\"\r\n\r\nThis rule was evidently designed to give to the President a reasonable\r\nopportunity of perusing important acts of Congress and giving them some\r\ndegree of consideration before signing or returning the same.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the two Houses have been in the habit of suspending this\r\nrule toward the close of the session in relation to particular bills,\r\nand it appears by the printed Journal that by concurrent votes of the\r\ntwo Houses passed on the last day of the session the rule was agreed to\r\nbe suspended so far as the same should relate to all such bills as\r\nshould have been passed by the two Houses at 1 o'clock on that day. It\r\nis exceedingly to be regretted that a necessity should ever exist for\r\nsuch suspension in the case of bills of great importance, and therefore\r\ndemanding careful consideration.\r\n\r\nAs the bill has failed under the provisions of the Constitution to\r\nbecome a law, I abstain from expressing any opinions upon its several\r\nprovisions, keeping myself wholly uncommitted as to my ultimate action\r\non any similar measure should the House think proper to originate it\r\n_de novo_, except so far as my opinion of the unqualified power of\r\neach House to decide for itself upon the elections, returns, and\r\nqualifications of its own members has been expressed by me in a paper\r\nlodged in the Department of State at the time of signing an act entitled\r\n\"An act for the apportionment of Representatives among the several\r\nStates according to the Sixth Census,\" approved June 22, 1842, a copy\r\nof which is in possession of the House.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December, 1843_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIf any people ever had cause to render up thanks to the Supreme Being\r\nfor parental care and protection extended to them in all the trials\r\nand difficulties to which they have been from time to time exposed, we\r\ncertainly are that people. From the first settlement of our forefathers\r\non this continent, through the dangers attendant upon the occupation\r\nof a savage wilderness, through a long period of colonial dependence,\r\nthrough the War of the Revolution, in the wisdom which led to the\r\nadoption of the existing forms of republican government, in the hazards\r\nincident to a war subsequently waged with one of the most powerful\r\nnations of the earth, in the increase of our population, in the spread\r\nof the arts and sciences, and in the strength and durability conferred\r\non political institutions emanating from the people and sustained by\r\ntheir will, the superintendence of an overruling Providence has been\r\nplainly visible. As preparatory, therefore, to entering once more upon\r\nthe high duties of legislation, it becomes us humbly to acknowledge\r\nour dependence upon Him as our guide and protector and to implore a\r\ncontinuance of His parental watchfulness over our beloved country. We\r\nhave new cause for the expression of our gratitude in the preservation\r\nof the health of our fellow-citizens, with some partial and local\r\nexceptions, during the past season, for the abundance with which the\r\nearth has yielded up its fruits to the labors of the husbandman, for the\r\nrenewed activity which has been imparted to commerce, for the revival of\r\ntrade in all its departments, for the increased rewards attendant on\r\nthe exercise of the mechanic arts, for the continued growth of our\r\npopulation and the rapidly reviving prosperity of the whole country.\r\nI shall be permitted to exchange congratulations with you, gentlemen of\r\nthe two Houses of Congress, on these auspicious circumstances, and to\r\nassure you in advance of my ready disposition to concur with you in the\r\nadoption of all such measures as shall be calculated to increase the\r\nhappiness of our constituents and to advance the glory of our common\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSince the last adjournment of Congress the Executive has relaxed no\r\neffort to render indestructible the relations of amity which so happily\r\nexist between the United States and other countries. The treaty lately\r\nconcluded with Great Britain has tended greatly to increase the good\r\nunderstanding which a reciprocity of interests is calculated to\r\nencourage, and it is most ardently to be hoped that nothing may\r\ntranspire to interrupt the relations of amity which it is so obviously\r\nthe policy of both nations to cultivate. A question of much importance\r\nstill remains to be adjusted between them. The territorial limits of the\r\ntwo countries in relation to what is commonly known as the Oregon\r\nTerritory still remain in dispute. The United States would be at all\r\ntimes indisposed to aggrandize itself at the expense of any other\r\nnation; but while they would be restrained by principles of honor, which\r\nshould govern the conduct of nations as well as that of individuals,\r\nfrom setting up a demand for territory which does not belong to them,\r\nthey would as unwillingly consent to a surrender of their rights. After\r\nthe most rigid and, as far as practicable, unbiased examination of the\r\nsubject, the United States have always contended that their rights\r\nappertain to the entire region of country lying on the Pacific and\r\nembraced within 42° and 54° 40' of north latitude. This claim being\r\ncontroverted by Great Britain, those who have preceded the present\r\nExecutive--actuated, no doubt, by an earnest desire to adjust the matter\r\nupon terms mutually satisfactory to both countries--have caused to be\r\nsubmitted to the British Government propositions for settlement and\r\nfinal adjustment, which, however, have not proved heretofore acceptable\r\nto it. Our minister at London has, under instructions, again brought the\r\nsubject to the consideration of that Government, and while nothing will\r\nbe done to compromit the rights or honor of the United States, every\r\nproper expedient will be resorted to in order to bring the negotiation\r\nnow in the progress of resumption to a speedy and happy termination. In\r\nthe meantime it is proper to remark that many of our citizens are either\r\nalready established in the Territory or are on their way thither for the\r\npurpose of forming permanent settlements, while others are preparing\r\nto follow; and in view of these facts I must repeat the recommendation\r\ncontained in previous messages for the establishment of military posts\r\nat such places on the line of travel as will furnish security and\r\nprotection to our hardy adventurers against hostile tribes of Indians\r\ninhabiting those extensive regions. Our laws should also follow them, so\r\nmodified as the circumstances of the case may seem to require. Under the\r\ninfluence of our free system of government new republics are destined\r\nto spring up at no distant day on the shores of the Pacific similar\r\nin policy and in feeling to those existing on this side of the Rocky\r\nMountains, and giving a wider and more extensive spread to the\r\nprinciples of civil and religious liberty.\r\n\r\nI am happy to inform you that the cases which have from time to time\r\narisen of the detention of American vessels by British cruisers on the\r\ncoast of Africa under pretense of being engaged in the slave trade have\r\nbeen placed in a fair train of adjustment. In the case of the _William\r\nand Francis_ full satisfaction will be allowed. In the cases of the\r\n_Tygris_ and _Seamew_ the British Government admits that satisfaction\r\nis due. In the case of the _Jones_ the sum accruing from the sale\r\nof that vessel and cargo will be paid to the owners, while I can not\r\nbut flatter myself that full indemnification will be allowed for all\r\ndamages sustained by the detention of the vessel; and in the case of the\r\n_Douglas_ Her Majesty's Government has expressed its determination to\r\nmake indemnification. Strong hopes are therefore entertained that most,\r\nif not all, of these cases will be speedily adjusted. No new cases have\r\narisen since the ratification of the treaty of Washington, and it is\r\nconfidently anticipated that the slave trade, under the operation of\r\nthe eighth article of that treaty, will be altogether suppressed.\r\n\r\nThe occasional interruption experienced by our fellow-citizens engaged\r\nin the fisheries on the neighboring coast of Nova Scotia has not failed\r\nto claim the attention of the Executive. Representations upon this\r\nsubject have been made, but as yet no definitive answer to those\r\nrepresentations has been received from the British Government.\r\n\r\nTwo other subjects of comparatively minor importance, but nevertheless\r\nof too much consequence to be neglected, remain still to be adjusted\r\nbetween the two countries. By the treaty between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain of July, 1815, it is provided that no higher duties shall\r\nbe levied in either country on articles imported from the other than on\r\nthe same articles imported from any other place. In 1836 rough rice by\r\nact of Parliament was admitted from the coast of Africa into Great\r\nBritain on the payment of a duty of 1 penny a quarter, while the same\r\narticle from all other countries, including the United States, was\r\nsubjected to the payment of a duty of 20 shillings a quarter. Our\r\nminister at London has from time to time brought this subject to the\r\nattention of the British Government, but so far without success. He is\r\ninstructed to renew his representations upon it.\r\n\r\nSome years since a claim was preferred against the British Government on\r\nthe part of certain American merchants for the return of export duties\r\npaid by them on shipments of woolen goods to the United States after the\r\nduty on similar articles exported to other countries had been repealed,\r\nand consequently in contravention of the commercial convention between\r\nthe two nations securing to us equality in such cases. The principle on\r\nwhich the claim rests has long since been virtually admitted by Great\r\nBritain, but obstacles to a settlement have from time to time been\r\ninterposed, so that a large portion of the amount claimed has not yet\r\nbeen refunded. Our minister is now engaged in the prosecution of the\r\nclaim, and I can not but persuade myself that the British Government\r\nwill no longer delay its adjustment.\r\n\r\nI am happy to be able to say that nothing has occurred to disturb in any\r\ndegree the relations of amity which exist between the United States and\r\nFrance, Austria, and Russia, as well as with the other powers of Europe,\r\nsince the adjournment of Congress. Spain has been agitated with internal\r\nconvulsions for many years, from the effects of which, it is hoped, she\r\nis destined speedily to recover, when, under a more liberal system of\r\ncommercial policy on her part, our trade with her may again fill its old\r\nand, so far as her continental possessions are concerned, its almost\r\nforsaken channels, thereby adding to the mutual prosperity of the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe Germanic Association of Customs and Commerce, which since its\r\nestablishment in 1833 has been steadily growing in power and importance,\r\nand consists at this time of more than twenty German States, and\r\nembraces a population of 27,000,000 people united for all the purposes\r\nof commercial intercourse with each other and with foreign states,\r\noffers to the latter the most valuable exchanges on principles more\r\nliberal than are offered in the fiscal system of any other European\r\npower. From its origin the importance of the German union has never been\r\nlost sight of by the United States. The industry, morality, and other\r\nvaluable qualities of the German nation have always been well known and\r\nappreciated. On this subject I invite the attention of Congress to the\r\nreport of the Secretary of State, from which it will be seen that while\r\nour cotton is admitted free of duty and the duty on rice has been much\r\nreduced (which has already led to a greatly increased consumption),\r\na strong disposition has been recently evinced by that great body to\r\nreduce, upon certain conditions, their present duty upon tobacco. This\r\nbeing the first intimation of a concession on this interesting subject\r\never made by any European power, I can not but regard it as well\r\ncalculated to remove the only impediment which has so far existed to\r\nthe most liberal commercial intercourse between us and them. In this\r\nview our minister at Berlin, who has heretofore industriously pursued\r\nthe subject, has been instructed to enter upon the negotiation of a\r\ncommercial treaty, which, while it will open new advantages to the\r\nagricultural interests of the United States and a more free and expanded\r\nfield for commercial operations, will affect injuriously no existing\r\ninterest of the Union. Should the negotiation be crowned with success,\r\nits results will be communicated to both Houses of Congress.\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith certain dispatches received from our minister at\r\nMexico, and also a correspondence which has recently occurred between\r\nthe envoy from that Republic and the Secretary of State. It must but be\r\nregarded as not a little extraordinary that the Government of Mexico,\r\nin anticipation of a public discussion (which it has been pleased to\r\ninfer from newspaper publications as likely to take place in Congress,\r\nrelating to the annexation of Texas to the United States), should have\r\nso far anticipated the result of such discussion as to have announced\r\nits determination to visit any such anticipated decision by a formal\r\ndeclaration of war against the United States. If designed to prevent\r\nCongress from introducing that question as a fit subject for its calm\r\ndeliberation and final judgment, the Executive has no reason to doubt\r\nthat it will entirely fail of its object. The representatives of a brave\r\nand patriotic people will suffer no apprehension of future consequences\r\nto embarrass them in the course of their proposed deliberations, nor\r\nwill the executive department of the Government fail for any such cause\r\nto discharge its whole duty to the country.\r\n\r\nThe war which has existed for so long a time between Mexico and Texas\r\nhas since the battle of San Jacinto consisted for the most part of\r\npredatory incursions, which, while they have been attended with much of\r\nsuffering to individuals and have kept the borders of the two countries\r\nin a state of constant alarm, have failed to approach to any definitive\r\nresult. Mexico has fitted out no formidable armament by land or by sea\r\nfor the subjugation of Texas. Eight years have now elapsed since Texas\r\ndeclared her independence of Mexico, and during that time she has been\r\nrecognized as a sovereign power by several of the principal civilized\r\nstates. Mexico, nevertheless, perseveres in her plans of reconquest, and\r\nrefuses to recognize her independence. The predatory incursions to which\r\nI have alluded have been attended in one instance with the breaking up\r\nof the courts of justice, by the seizing upon the persons of the judges,\r\njury, and officers of the court and dragging them along with unarmed,\r\nand therefore noncombatant, citizens into a cruel and oppressive\r\nbondage, thus leaving crime to go unpunished and immorality to pass\r\nunreproved. A border warfare is evermore to be deprecated, and over such\r\na war as has existed for so many years between these two States humanity\r\nhas had great cause to lament. Nor is such a condition of things to be\r\ndeplored only because of the individual suffering attendant upon it. The\r\neffects are far more extensive. The Creator of the Universe has given\r\nman the earth for his resting place and its fruits for his subsistence.\r\nWhatever, therefore, shall make the first or any part of it a scene of\r\ndesolation affects injuriously his heritage and may be regarded as a\r\ngeneral calamity. Wars may sometimes be necessary, but all nations have\r\na common interest in bringing them speedily to a close. The United\r\nStates have an immediate interest in seeing an end put to the state of\r\nhostilities existing between Mexico and Texas. They are our neighbors,\r\nof the same continent, with whom we are not only desirous of cultivating\r\nthe relations of amity, but of the most extended commercial intercourse,\r\nand to practice all the rites of a neighborhood hospitality. Our own\r\ninterests are involved in the matter, since, however neutral may be our\r\ncourse of policy, we can not hope to escape the effects of a spirit of\r\njealousy on the part of both of the powers. Nor can this Government be\r\nindifferent to the fact that a warfare such as is waged between those\r\ntwo nations is calculated to weaken both powers and finally to render\r\nthem--and especially the weaker of the two--the subjects of interference\r\non the part of stronger and more powerful nations, who, intent only on\r\nadvancing their own peculiar views, may sooner or later attempt to bring\r\nabout a compliance with terms as the condition of their interposition\r\nalike derogatory to the nation granting them and detrimental to the\r\ninterests of the United States. We could not be expected quietly to\r\npermit any such interference to our disadvantage. Considering that Texas\r\nis separated from the United States by a mere geographical line; that\r\nher territory, in the opinion of many, down to a late period formed a\r\nportion of the territory of the United States; that it is homogeneous\r\nin its population and pursuits with the adjoining States, makes\r\ncontributions to the commerce of the world in the same articles with\r\nthem, and that most of her inhabitants have been citizens of the United\r\nStates, speak the same language, and live under similar political\r\ninstitutions with ourselves, this Government is bound by every\r\nconsideration of interest as well as of sympathy to see that she shall\r\nbe left free to act, especially in regard to her domestic affairs,\r\nunawed by force and unrestrained by the policy or views of other\r\ncountries. In full view of all these considerations, the Executive has\r\nnot hesitated to express to the Government of Mexico how deeply it\r\ndeprecated a continuance of the war and how anxiously it desired to\r\nwitness its termination. I can not but think that it becomes the United\r\nStates, as the oldest of the American Republics, to hold a language to\r\nMexico upon this subject of an unambiguous character. It is time that\r\nthis war had ceased. There must be a limit to all wars, and if the\r\nparent state after an eight years' struggle has failed to reduce to\r\nsubmission a portion of its subjects standing out in revolt against it,\r\nand who have not only proclaimed themselves to be independent, but have\r\nbeen recognized as such by other powers, she ought not to expect that\r\nother nations will quietly look on, to their obvious injury, upon a\r\nprotraction of hostilities. These United States threw off their colonial\r\ndependence and established independent governments, and Great Britain,\r\nafter having wasted her energies in the attempt to subdue them for a\r\nless period than Mexico has attempted to subjugate Texas, had the wisdom\r\nand justice to acknowledge their independence, thereby recognizing the\r\nobligation which rested on her as one of the family of nations. An\r\nexample thus set by one of the proudest as well as most powerful nations\r\nof the earth it could in no way disparage Mexico to imitate. While,\r\ntherefore, the Executive would deplore any collision with Mexico or\r\nany disturbance of the friendly relations which exist between the two\r\ncountries, it can not permit that Government to control its policy,\r\nwhatever it may be, toward Texas, but will treat her--as by the\r\nrecognition of her independence the United States have long since\r\ndeclared they would do--as entirely independent of Mexico. The high\r\nobligations of public duty may enforce from the constituted authorities\r\nof the United States a policy which the course persevered in by Mexico\r\nwill have mainly contributed to produce, and the Executive in such a\r\ncontingency will with confidence throw itself upon the patriotism of\r\nthe people to sustain the Government in its course of action.\r\n\r\nMeasures of an unusual character have recently been adopted by the\r\nMexican Government, calculated in no small degree to affect the trade\r\nof other nations with Mexico and to operate injuriously to the United\r\nStates. All foreigners, by a decree of the 23d day of September, and\r\nafter six months from the day of its promulgation, are forbidden to\r\ncarry on the business of selling by retail any goods within the confines\r\nof Mexico. Against this decree our minister has not failed to\r\nremonstrate.\r\n\r\nThe trade heretofore carried on by our citizens with Santa Fe,\r\nin which much capital was already invested and which was becoming of\r\ndaily increasing importance, has suddenly been arrested by a decree of\r\nvirtual prohibition on the part of the Mexican Government. Whatever may\r\nbe the right of Mexico to prohibit any particular course of trade to the\r\ncitizens or subjects of foreign powers, this late procedure, to say the\r\nleast of it, wears a harsh and unfriendly aspect.\r\n\r\nThe installments on the claims recently settled by the convention with\r\nMexico have been punctually paid as they have fallen due, and our\r\nminister is engaged in urging the establishment of a new commission in\r\npursuance of the convention for the settlement of unadjusted claims.\r\n\r\nWith the other American States our relations of amity and good will have\r\nremained uninterrupted. Our minister near the Republic of New Granada\r\nhas succeeded in effecting an adjustment of the claim upon that\r\nGovernment for the schooner _By Chance_, which had been pending for many\r\nyears. The claim for the brig _Morris_, which had its origin during the\r\nexistence of the Republic of Colombia, and indemnification for which\r\nsince the dissolution of that Republic has devolved upon its several\r\nmembers, will be urged with renewed zeal.\r\n\r\nI have much pleasure in saying that the Government of Brazil has\r\nadjusted the claim upon that Government in the case of the schooner\r\n_John S. Bryan_, and that sanguine hopes are entertained that the same\r\nspirit of justice will influence its councils in arriving at an early\r\ndecision upon the remaining claims, thereby removing all cause of\r\ndissension between two powers whose interests are to some extent\r\ninterwoven with each other.\r\n\r\nOur minister at Chili has succeeded in inducing a recognition by that\r\nGovernment of the adjustment effected by his predecessor of the first\r\nclaim in the case of the _Macedonian_. The first installment has been\r\nreceived by the claimants in the United States.\r\n\r\nNotice of the exchange of ratifications of the treaty with Peru, which\r\nwill take place at Lima, has not yet reached this country, but is\r\nshortly expected to be received, when the claims upon that Republic will\r\ndoubtless be liquidated and paid.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of a misunderstanding between this Government and that of\r\nBuenos Ayres, occurring several years ago, this Government has remained\r\nunrepresented at that Court, while a minister from it has been\r\nconstantly resident here. The causes of irritation have in a great\r\nmeasure passed away, and it is in contemplation, in view of important\r\ninterests which have grown up in that country, at some early period\r\nduring the present session of Congress, with the concurrence of the\r\nSenate, to restore diplomatic relations between the two countries.\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of an act of Congress of the last session a\r\nminister was dispatched from the United States to China in August of the\r\npresent year, who, from the latest accounts we have from him, was at\r\nSuez, in Egypt, on the 25th of September last, on his route to China.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Indian tribes residing within our jurisdictional\r\nlimits, the greatest vigilance of the Government has been exerted to\r\npreserve them at peace among themselves and to inspire them with\r\nfeelings of confidence in the justice of this Government and to\r\ncultivate friendship with the border inhabitants. This has happily\r\nsucceeded to a great extent, but it is a subject of regret that they\r\nsuffer themselves in some instances to be imposed upon by artful and\r\ndesigning men, and this notwithstanding all efforts of the Government\r\nto prevent it.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury for the calendar year 1843, exclusive\r\nof loans, were little more than $18,000,000, and the expenditures,\r\nexclusive of the payments on the public debt, will have been about\r\n$23,000,000. By the act of 1842 a new arrangement of the fiscal year was\r\nmade, so that it should commence on the 1st day of July in each year.\r\nThe accounts and estimates for the current fiscal year will show that\r\nthe loans and Treasury notes made and issued before the close of the\r\nlast Congress to meet the anticipated deficiency have not been entirely\r\nadequate. Although on the 1st of October last there was a balance in the\r\nTreasury, in consequence of the provisions thus made, of $3,914,082.77,\r\nyet the appropriations already made by Congress will absorb that balance\r\nand leave a probable deficiency of $2,000,000 at the close of the\r\npresent fiscal year. There are outstanding Treasury notes to about the\r\namount of $4,600,000, and should they be returned upon the Treasury\r\nduring the fiscal year they will require provision for their redemption.\r\nI do not, however, regard this as probable, since they have obviously\r\nentered into the currency of the country and will continue to form a\r\nportion of it if the system now adopted be continued. The loan of 1841,\r\namounting to $5,672,976.88, falls due on the 1st day of January, 1845,\r\nand must be provided for or postponed by a new loan; and unless the\r\nresources of revenue should be materially increased by you there will be\r\na probable deficiency for the service of the fiscal year ending June 30,\r\n1845, of upward of $4,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe delusion incident to an enormously excessive paper circulation,\r\nwhich gave a fictitious value to everything and stimulated adventure and\r\nspeculation to an extravagant extent, has been happily succeeded by the\r\nsubstitution of the precious metals and paper promptly redeemable in\r\nspecie; and thus false values have disappeared and a sounder condition\r\nof things has been introduced. This transition, although intimately\r\nconnected with the prosperity of the country, has nevertheless been\r\nattended with much embarrassment to the Government in its financial\r\nconcerns. So long as the foreign importers could receive payment for\r\ntheir cargoes in a currency of greatly less value than that in Europe,\r\nbut fully available here in the purchase of our agricultural productions\r\n(their profits being immeasurably augmented by the operation), the\r\nshipments were large and the revenues of the Government became\r\nsuperabundant. But the change in the character of the circulation from a\r\nnominal and apparently real value in the first stage of its existence\r\nto an obviously depreciated value in its second, so that it no longer\r\nanswered the purposes of exchange or barter, and its ultimate\r\nsubstitution by a sound metallic and paper circulation combined, has\r\nbeen attended by diminished importations and a consequent falling off\r\nin the revenue. This has induced Congress, from 1837, to resort to the\r\nexpedient of issuing Treasury notes, and finally of funding them, in\r\norder to supply deficiencies. I can not, however, withhold the remark\r\nthat it is in no way compatible with the dignity of the Government that\r\na public debt should be created in time of peace to meet the current\r\nexpenses of the Government, or that temporary expedients should be\r\nresorted to an hour longer than it is possible to avoid them. The\r\nExecutive can do no more than apply the means which Congress places in\r\nits hands for the support of Government, and, happily for the good of\r\nthe country and for the preservation of its liberties, it possesses\r\nno power to levy exactions on the people or to force from them\r\ncontributions to the public revenue in any form. It can only recommend\r\nsuch measures as may in its opinion be called for by the wants of the\r\npublic service to Congress, with whom alone rests the power to \"lay and\r\ncollect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises.\" This duty has upon several\r\noccasions heretofore been performed. The present condition of things\r\ngives flattering promise that trade and commerce are rapidly reviving,\r\nand, fortunately for the country, the sources of revenue have only to\r\nbe opened in order to prove abundant.\r\n\r\nWhile we can anticipate no considerable increase in the proceeds of the\r\nsales of the public lands, for reasons perfectly obvious to all, for\r\nseveral years to come, yet the public lands can not otherwise than be\r\nregarded as the foundation of the public credit. With so large a body\r\nof the most fertile lands in the world under the control and at the\r\ndisposal of this Government, no one can reasonably doubt the entire\r\nability to meet its engagements under every emergency. In seasons of\r\ntrial and difficulty similar to those through which we are passing the\r\ncapitalist makes his investments in the Government stocks with the most\r\nassured confidence of ultimate reimbursement; and whatever may be said\r\nof a period of great financial prosperity, such as existed for some\r\nyears after 1833, I should regard it as suicidal in a season of\r\nfinancial embarrassment either to alienate the lands themselves or the\r\nproceeds arising from their sales. The first and paramount duty of those\r\nto whom may be intrusted the administration of public affairs is to\r\nguard the public credit. In reestablishing the credit of this central\r\nGovernment the readiest and most obvious mode is taken to restore\r\nthe credit of the States. The extremities can only be made sound by\r\nproducing a healthy action in the central Government, and the history of\r\nthe present day fully establishes the fact that an increase in the value\r\nof the stocks of this Government will in a great majority of instances\r\nbe attended by an increase in the value of the stocks of the States. It\r\nshould therefore be a matter of general congratulation that amidst all\r\nthe embarrassments arising from surrounding circumstances the credit\r\nof the Government should have been so fully restored that it has been\r\nenabled to effect a loan of $7,000,000 to redeem that amount of Treasury\r\nnotes on terms more favorable than any that have been offered for many\r\nyears. And the 6 per cent stock which was created in 1842 has advanced\r\nin the hands of the holders nearly 20 per cent above its par value. The\r\nconfidence of the people in the integrity of their Government has thus\r\nbeen signally manifested. These opinions relative to the public lands\r\ndo not in any manner conflict with the observance of the most liberal\r\npolicy toward those of our fellow-citizens who press forward into the\r\nwilderness and are the pioneers in the work of its reclamation. In\r\nsecuring to all such their rights of preemption the Government performs\r\nbut an act of retributive justice for sufferings encountered and\r\nhardships endured, and finds ample remuneration in the comforts which\r\nits policy insures and the happiness which it imparts.\r\n\r\nShould a revision of the tariff with a view to revenue become necessary\r\nin the estimation of Congress, I doubt not you will approach the subject\r\nwith a just and enlightened regard to the interests of the whole Union.\r\nThe principles and views which I have heretofore had occasion to submit\r\nremain unchanged. It can, however, never be too often repeated that the\r\nprominent interest of every important pursuit of life requires for\r\nsuccess permanency and stability in legislation. These can only be\r\nattained by adopting as the basis of action moderation in all things,\r\nwhich is as indispensably necessary to secure the harmonious action of\r\nthe political as of the animal system. In our political organization no\r\none section of the country should desire to have its supposed interests\r\nadvanced at the sacrifice of all others, but union, being the great\r\ninterest, equally precious to all, should be fostered and sustained by\r\nmutual concessions and the cultivation of that spirit of compromise from\r\nwhich the Constitution itself proceeded.\r\n\r\nYou will be informed by the report from the Treasury Department of the\r\nmeasures taken under the act of the last session authorizing the reissue\r\nof Treasury notes in lieu of those then outstanding. The system adopted\r\nin pursuance of existing laws seems well calculated to save the country\r\na large amount of interest, while it affords conveniences and obviates\r\ndangers and expense in the transmission of funds to disbursing agents.\r\nI refer you also to that report for the means proposed by the Secretary\r\nto increase the revenue, and particularly to that portion of it which\r\nrelates to the subject of the warehousing system, which I earnestly\r\nurged upon Congress at its last session and as to the importance of\r\nwhich my opinion has undergone no change.\r\n\r\nIn view of the disordered condition of the currency at the time and\r\nthe high rates of exchange between different parts of the country,\r\nI felt it to be incumbent on me to present to the consideration of\r\nyour predecessors a proposition conflicting in no degree with the\r\nConstitution or with the rights of the States and having the sanction\r\n(not in detail, but in principle) of some of the eminent men who have\r\npreceded me in the Executive office. That proposition contemplated the\r\nissuing of Treasury notes of denominations of not less than $5 nor more\r\nthan $100, to be employed in the payment of the obligations of the\r\nGovernment in lieu of gold and silver at the option of the public\r\ncreditor, and to an amount not exceeding $15,000,000. It was proposed\r\nto make them receivable everywhere and to establish at various points\r\ndepositories of gold and silver to be held in trust for the redemption\r\nof such notes, so as to insure their convertibility into specie. No\r\ndoubt was entertained that such notes would have maintained a par value\r\nwith gold and silver, thus furnishing a paper currency of equal value\r\nover the Union, thereby meeting the just expectations of the people and\r\nfulfilling the duties of a parental government. Whether the depositories\r\nshould be permitted to sell or purchase bills under very limited\r\nrestrictions, together with all its other details, was submitted to\r\nthe wisdom of Congress and was regarded as of secondary importance.\r\nI thought then and think now that such an arrangement would have been\r\nattended with the happiest results. The whole matter of the currency\r\nwould have been placed where by the Constitution it was designed to be\r\nplaced--under the immediate supervision and control of Congress.\r\nThe action of the Government would have been independent of all\r\ncorporations, and the same eye which rests unceasingly on the specie\r\ncurrency and guards it against adulteration would also have rested on\r\nthe paper currency, to control and regulate its issues and protect it\r\nagainst depreciation. The same reasons which would forbid Congress from\r\nparting with the power over the coinage would seem to operate with\r\nnearly equal force in regard to any substitution for the precious metals\r\nin the form of a circulating medium. Paper when substituted for specie\r\nconstitutes a standard of value by which the operations of society are\r\nregulated, and whatsoever causes its depreciation affects society to an\r\nextent nearly, if not quite, equal to the adulteration of the coin. Nor\r\ncan I withhold the remark that its advantages contrasted with a bank\r\nof the United States, apart from the fact that a bank was esteemed as\r\nobnoxious to the public sentiment as well on the score of expediency\r\nas of constitutionalty, appeared to me to be striking and obvious.\r\nThe relief which a bank would afford by an issue of $15,000,000 of its\r\nnotes, judging from the experience of the late United States Bank, would\r\nnot have occurred in less than fifteen years, whereas under the proposed\r\narrangement the relief arising from the issue of $15,000,000 of Treasury\r\nnotes would have been consummated in one year, thus furnishing in\r\none-fifteenth part of the time in which a bank could have accomplished\r\nit a paper medium of exchange equal in amount to the real wants of the\r\ncountry at par value with gold and silver. The saving to the Government\r\nwould have been equal to all the interest which it has had to pay on\r\nTreasury notes of previous as well as subsequent issues, thereby\r\nrelieving the Government and at the same time affording relief to the\r\npeople. Under all the responsibilities attached to the station which\r\nI occupy, and in redemption of a pledge given to the last Congress\r\nat the close of its first session, I submitted the suggestion to its\r\nconsideration at two consecutive sessions. The recommendation, however,\r\nmet with no favor at its hands. While I am free to admit that the\r\nnecessities of the times have since become greatly ameliorated and that\r\nthere is good reason to hope that the country is safely and rapidly\r\nemerging from the difficulties and embarrassments which everywhere\r\nsurrounded it in 1841, yet I can not but think that its restoration to\r\na sound and healthy condition would be greatly expedited by a resort\r\nto the expedient in a modified form.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Treasury now rest upon the act of 1789 and the\r\nresolution of 1816, and those laws have been so administered as to\r\nproduce as great a quantum of good to the country as their provisions\r\nare capable of yielding. If there had been any distinct expression of\r\nopinion going to show that public sentiment is averse to the plan,\r\neither as heretofore recommended to Congress or in a modified form,\r\nwhile my own opinion in regard to it would remain unchanged I should be\r\nvery far from again presenting it to your consideration. The Government\r\nhas originated with the States and the people, for their own benefit and\r\nadvantage, and it would be subversive of the foundation principles of\r\nthe political edifice which they have reared to persevere in a measure\r\nwhich in their mature judgments they had either repudiated or condemned.\r\nThe will of our constituents clearly expressed should be regarded as the\r\nlight to guide our footsteps, the true difference between a monarchical\r\nor aristocratical government and a republic being that in the first the\r\nwill of the few prevails over the will of the many, while in the last\r\nthe will of the many should be alone consulted.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War will bring you acquainted with the\r\ncondition of that important branch of the public service. The Army may\r\nbe regarded, in consequence of the small number of the rank and file in\r\neach company and regiment, as little more than a nucleus around which\r\nto rally the military force of the country in case of war, and yet\r\nits services in preserving the peace of the frontiers are of a most\r\nimportant nature. In all cases of emergency the reliance of the country\r\nis properly placed in the militia of the several States, and it may well\r\ndeserve the consideration of Congress whether a new and more perfect\r\norganization might not be introduced, looking mainly to the volunteer\r\ncompanies of the Union for the present and of easy application to the\r\ngreat body of the militia in time of war.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures of the War Department have been considerably reduced in\r\nthe last two years. Contingencies, however, may arise which would call\r\nfor the filling up of the regiments with a full complement of men and\r\nmake it very desirable to remount the corps of dragoons, which by an act\r\nof the last Congress was directed to be dissolved.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the accompanying report of the Secretary for information\r\nin relation to the Navy of the United States. While every effort has\r\nbeen and will continue to be made to retrench all superfluities and lop\r\noff all excrescences which from time to time may have grown up, yet it\r\nhas not been regarded as wise or prudent to recommend any material\r\nchange in the annual appropriations. The interests which are involved\r\nare of too important a character to lead to the recommendation of any\r\nother than a liberal policy. Adequate appropriations ought to be made to\r\nenable the Executive to fit out all the ships that are now in a course\r\nof building or that require repairs for active service in the shortest\r\npossible time should any emergency arise which may require it. An\r\nefficient navy, while it is the cheapest means of public defense,\r\nenlists in its support the feelings of pride and confidence which\r\nbrilliant deeds and heroic valor have heretofore served to strengthen\r\nand confirm.\r\n\r\nI refer you particularly to that part of the Secretary's report which\r\nhas reference to recent experiments in the application of steam and in\r\nthe construction of our war steamers, made under the superintendence\r\nof distinguished officers of the Navy. In addition to other manifest\r\nimprovements in the construction of the steam engine and application of\r\nthe motive power which has rendered them more appropriate to the uses of\r\nships of war, one of those officers has brought into use a power which\r\nmakes the steamship most formidable either for attack or defense. I can\r\nnot too strongly recommend this subject to your consideration and do not\r\nhesitate to express my entire conviction of its great importance.\r\n\r\nI call your particular attention also to that portion of the Secretary's\r\nreport which has reference to the act of the late session of Congress\r\nwhich prohibited the transfer of any balance of appropriation from other\r\nheads of appropriation to that for building, equipment, and repair.\r\nThe repeal of that prohibition will enable the Department to give\r\nrenewed employment to a large class of workmen who have been necessarily\r\ndischarged in consequence of the want of means to pay them--a\r\ncircumstance attended, especially at this season of the year, with much\r\nprivation and suffering.\r\n\r\nIt gives me great pain to announce to you the loss of the steamship\r\nthe _Missouri_ by fire in the Bay of Gibraltar, where she had stopped\r\nto renew her supplies of coal on her voyage to Alexandria, with Mr.\r\nCushing, the American minister to China, on board. There is ground\r\nfor high commendation of the officers and men for the coolness and\r\nintrepidity and perfect submission to discipline evinced under the most\r\ntrying circumstances. Surrounded by a raging fire, which the utmost\r\nexertions could not subdue, and which threatened momentarily the\r\nexplosion of her well-supplied magazines, the officers exhibited no\r\nsigns of fear and the men obeyed every order with alacrity. Nor was she\r\nabandoned until the last gleam of hope of saving her had expired. It is\r\nwell worthy of your consideration whether the losses sustained by the\r\nofficers and crew in this unfortunate affair should not be reimbursed\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nI can not take leave of this painful subject without adverting to the\r\naid rendered upon the occasion by the British authorities at Gibraltar\r\nand the commander, officers, and crew of the British ship of the line\r\nthe _Malabar_, which was lying at the time in the bay. Everything that\r\ngenerosity or humanity could dictate was promptly performed. It is by\r\nsuch acts of good will by one to another of the family of nations that\r\nfraternal feelings are nourished and the blessings of permanent peace\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General will bring you acquainted with the\r\noperations of that Department during the past year, and will suggest\r\nto you such modifications of the existing laws as in your opinion\r\nthe exigencies of the public service may require. The change which\r\nthe country has undergone of late years in the mode of travel and\r\ntransportation has afforded so many facilities for the transmission of\r\nmail matter out of the regular mail as to require the greatest vigilance\r\nand circumspection in order to enable the officer at the head of the\r\nDepartment to restrain the expenditures within the income. There is also\r\ntoo much reason to fear that the franking privilege has run into great\r\nabuse. The Department, nevertheless, has been conducted with the\r\ngreatest vigor, and has attained at the least possible expense all the\r\nuseful objects for which it was established.\r\n\r\nIn regard to all the Departments, I am quite happy in the belief that\r\nnothing has been left undone which was called for by a true spirit of\r\neconomy or by a system of accountability rigidly enforced. This is in\r\nsome degree apparent from the fact that the Government has sustained no\r\nloss by the default of any of its agents. In the complex, but at the\r\nsame time beautiful, machinery of our system of government, it is not\r\na matter of surprise that some remote agency may have failed for an\r\ninstant to fulfill its desired office; but I feel confident in the\r\nassertion that nothing has occurred to interrupt the harmonious action\r\nof the Government itself, and that, while the laws have been executed\r\nwith efficiency and vigor, the rights neither of States nor individuals\r\nhave been trampled on or disregarded.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the country has been steadily advancing in all that\r\ncontributes to national greatness. The tide of population continues\r\nunbrokenly to flow into the new States and Territories, where a refuge\r\nis found not only for our native-born fellow-citizens, but for emigrants\r\nfrom all parts of the civilized world, who come among us to partake of\r\nthe blessings of our free institutions and to aid by their labor to\r\nswell the current of our wealth and power.\r\n\r\nIt is due to every consideration of public policy that the lakes and\r\nrivers of the West should receive all such attention at the hands\r\nof Congress as the Constitution will enable it to bestow. Works in\r\nfavorable and proper situations on the Lakes would be found to be as\r\nindispensably necessary, in case of war, to carry on safe and successful\r\nnaval operations as fortifications on the Atlantic seaboard. The\r\nappropriation made by the last Congress for the improvement of the\r\nnavigation of the Mississippi River has been diligently and efficiently\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nI can not close this communication, gentlemen, without recommending\r\nto your most favorable consideration the interests of this District.\r\nAppointed by the Constitution its exclusive legislators, and forming\r\nin this particular the only anomaly in our system of government--of the\r\nlegislative body being elected by others than those for whose advantage\r\nthey are to legislate--you will feel a superadded obligation to look\r\nwell into their condition and to leave no cause for complaint or regret.\r\nThe seat of Government of our associated republics can not but be\r\nregarded as worthy of your parental care.\r\n\r\nIn connection with its other interests, as well as those of the whole\r\ncountry, I recommend that at your present session you adopt such\r\nmeasures in order to carry into effect the Smithsonian bequest as in\r\nyour judgment will be best calculated to consummate the liberal intent\r\nof the testator.\r\n\r\nWhen, under a dispensation of Divine Providence, I succeeded to the\r\nPresidential office, the state of public affairs was embarrassing and\r\ncritical. To add to the irritation consequent upon a long-standing\r\ncontroversy with one of the most powerful nations of modern times,\r\ninvolving not only questions of boundary (which under the most favorable\r\ncircumstances are always embarrassing), but at the same time important\r\nand high principles of maritime law, border controversies between\r\nthe citizens and subjects of the two countries had engendered a\r\nstate of feeling and of conduct which threatened the most calamitous\r\nconsequences. The hazards incident to this state of things were greatly\r\nheightened by the arrest and imprisonment of a subject of Great Britain,\r\nwho, acting (as it was alleged) as a part of a military force, had aided\r\nin the commission of an act violative of the territorial jurisdiction of\r\nthe United States and involving the murder of a citizen of the State of\r\nNew York. A large amount of claims against the Government of Mexico\r\nremained unadjusted and a war of several years' continuance with the\r\nsavage tribes of Florida still prevailed, attended with the desolation\r\nof a large portion of that beautiful Territory and with the sacrifice of\r\nmany valuable lives. To increase the embarrassments of the Government,\r\nindividual and State credit had been nearly stricken down and confidence\r\nin the General Government was so much impaired that loans of a small\r\namount could only be negotiated at a considerable sacrifice. As a\r\nnecessary consequence of the blight which had fallen on commerce and\r\nmechanical industry, the ships of the one were thrown out of employment\r\nand the operations of the other had been greatly diminished. Owing to\r\nthe condition of the currency, exchanges between different parts of\r\nthe country had become ruinously high and trade had to depend on a\r\ndepreciated paper currency in conducting its transactions. I shall\r\nbe permitted to congratulate the country that under an overruling\r\nProvidence peace was preserved without a sacrifice of the national\r\nhonor; the war in Florida was brought to a speedy termination; a large\r\nportion of the claims on Mexico have been fully adjudicated and are in\r\na course of payment, while justice has been rendered to us in other\r\nmatters by other nations; confidence between man and man is in a great\r\nmeasure restored and the credit of this Government fully and perfectly\r\nreestablished; commerce is becoming more and more extended in its\r\noperations and manufacturing and mechanical industry once more reap the\r\nrewards of skill and labor honestly applied; the operations of trade\r\nrest on a sound currency and the rates of exchange are reduced to their\r\nlowest amount.\r\n\r\nIn this condition of things I have felt it to be my duty to bring to\r\nyour favorable consideration matters of great interest in their present\r\nand ultimate results; and the only desire which I feel in connection\r\nwith the future is and will continue to be to leave the country\r\nprosperous and its institutions unimpaired.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY OF WASHINGTON, _December 8, 1843_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nexhibiting certain transfers of appropriations which have been made in\r\nthat Department in pursuance of the power vested in the President of the\r\nUnited States by the act of Congress of the 3d March, 1809, entitled\r\n\"An act further to amend the several acts for the establishment and\r\nregulation of the Treasury, War, and Navy Departments.\"\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 12, 1843_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate, for their consideration in reference\r\nto its ratification, a convention for the surrender of criminals between\r\nthe United States of America and His Majesty the King of the French,\r\nsigned at this place on the 9th day of November last by the Secretary\r\nof State and the minister plenipotentiary _ad interim_ from the French\r\nGovernment to the United States.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 16, 1843_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe two Houses of Congress at their last session passed a joint\r\nresolution, which originated in the House of Representatives,\r\n\"presenting the thanks of Congress to Samuel T.

The act\r\nentitled \"An act to authorize the President of the United States to\r\ndirect transfers of appropriation in the naval service under certain\r\ncircumstances\" has this day met with my approval, under no expectation\r\nthat it can be rendered available to the present wants of the service,\r\nbut as containing an exposition of the views of Congress as to the\r\nentire policy of transfers from one head of appropriation to any\r\nother in the naval service and as a guide to the Executive in the\r\nadministration of the duties of that Department. The restrictions\r\nlaid upon the power to transfer by the latter clauses of the act have\r\nrendered its passage of no avail at the present moment.\r\n\r\nIt will, however, be perceived by the document accompanying the report\r\nof the Secretary that there has been realized by recent sales of old\r\niron, copper, and other materials the sum of $116,922.79. These sales\r\nwere ordered for the express purpose of enabling the Executive to\r\ncomplete certain ships now on the stocks, the completion of which is\r\ncalled for by the economical wants of the service; and the doubt\r\nexisting as to the power of the Government to apply this sum to the\r\nobjects contemplated proceeds from the fact that the late Secretary of\r\nthe Navy directed them to be placed in the Treasury, although in doing\r\nso he had no intention of diverting them from their intended head of\r\nexpenditure. The Secretary of the Treasury, however, has brought himself\r\nto the opinion that they could only be entered under the head of\r\nmiscellaneous receipts, and therefore can only be withdrawn by authority\r\nof an express act of Congress. I would suggest the propriety of the\r\npassage of such an act without delay.\r\n\r\nAs intimately associated with the means of public defense, I can not\r\nforbear urging upon you the importance of constructing, upon the\r\nprinciples which have been brought into use in the construction of the\r\n_Princeton_, several ships of war of a larger class, better fitted than\r\nthat ship to the heavy armament which should be placed on board of them.\r\nThe success which has so eminently crowned this first experiment should\r\nencourage Congress to lose no time in availing the country of all the\r\nimportant benefits so obviously destined to flow from it. Other nations\r\nwill speedily give their attention to the subject, and it would be\r\ncriminal in the United States, the first to apply to practical purposes\r\nthe great power which has been brought into use, to permit others to\r\navail themselves of our improvements while we stood listlessly and\r\nsupinely by. In the number of steam vessels of war we are greatly\r\nsurpassed by other nations, and yet to Americans is the world indebted\r\nfor that great discovery of the means of successfully applying steam\r\npower which has in the last quarter century so materially changed the\r\ncondition of the world. We have now taken another and even bolder step,\r\nthe results of which upon the affairs of nations remain still to be\r\ndetermined, and I can not but flatter myself that it will be followed\r\nup without loss of time to the full extent of the public demands. The\r\nSecretary of the Navy will be instructed to lay before you suitable\r\nestimates of the cost of constructing so many ships of such size and\r\ndimensions as you may think proper to order to be built.\r\n\r\nThe application of steam power to ships of war no longer confines us to\r\nthe seaboard in their construction. The urgent demands of the service\r\nfor the Gulf of Mexico and the substitution of iron for wood in the\r\nconstruction of ships plainly point to the establishment of a navy-yard\r\nat some suitable place on the Mississippi. The coal fields and iron\r\nmines of the extensive region watered by that noble river recommend such\r\nan establishment, while high considerations of public policy would lead\r\nto the same conclusion.\r\n\r\nOne of the complaints of the Western States against the actual operation\r\nof our system of government is that while large and increasing\r\nexpenditures of public money are made on the Atlantic frontier the\r\nexpenditures in the interior are comparatively small. The time has now\r\narrived when this cause of complaint may be in a great measure removed\r\nby adopting the legitimate and necessary policy which I have indicated,\r\nthereby throwing around the States another bond of union.\r\n\r\nI could not forego the favorable opportunity which has presented itself,\r\ngrowing out of the communication from the Secretary of the Navy, to urge\r\nupon you the foregoing recommendations.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 29, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have to perform the melancholy duty of announcing to the two Houses of\r\nCongress the death of the Hon. Abel P. Upshur, late Secretary of State,\r\nand the Hon. Thomas W. Gilmer, late Secretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\nThis most lamentable occurrence transpired on board the United States\r\nship of war the _Princeton_ on yesterday at about half past 4 o'clock in\r\nthe evening, and proceeded from the explosion of one of the large guns\r\nof that ship.\r\n\r\nThe loss which the Government and the country have sustained by this\r\ndeplorable event is heightened by the death at the same time and by the\r\nsame cause of several distinguished persons and valuable citizens.\r\n\r\nI shall be permitted to express my great grief at an occurrence\r\nwhich has thus suddenly stricken from my side two gentlemen upon whose\r\nadvice I so confidently relied in the discharge of my arduous task of\r\nadministering the office of the executive department, and whose services\r\nat this interesting period were of such vast importance.\r\n\r\nIn some relief of the public sorrow which must necessarily accompany\r\nthis most painful event, it affords me much satisfaction to say that\r\nit was produced by no carelessness or inattention on the part of the\r\nofficers and crew of the _Princeton_, but must be set down as one of\r\nthose casualties which to a greater or less degree attend upon every\r\nservice, and which are invariably incident to the temporal affairs of\r\nmankind. I will also add that it in no measure detracts from the value\r\nof the improvement contemplated in the construction of the _Princeton_\r\nor from the merits of her brave and distinguished commander and\r\nprojector.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 7, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives a report[105] from the Secretary\r\nof State, with documents, containing the information requested by\r\ntheir resolution of the 26th ultimo.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: Relating to the colony of Liberia, in Africa.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 8, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n10th of January last, I communicate to that body a report[106] from the\r\nSecretary of State _ad interim_, which embraces the information called\r\nfor by said resolution.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: Relating to the production, growth, and trade in tobacco.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 8, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to the Senate a report,[107] with the documents\r\naccompanying it, from the Secretary of State, in answer to a resolution\r\nof that body of the 25th of January, 1844.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: Transmitting names, returns, etc., of consuls and\r\ncommercial agents of the United States.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 9, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, in answer to their resolution of the 21st\r\nultimo, a report[108] from the Secretary of State, with accompanying\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: Relating to the abuse of the United States flag in\r\nsubservience to the African slave trade, and to the taking away of\r\nslaves the property of Portuguese subjects in vessels owned or\r\nemployed by citizens of the United States.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 11, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with your resolution of the 26th ultimo, I herewith\r\ntransmit a report[109] from the Secretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: Transmitting list of officers appointed in the Navy\r\nsince June 1, 1843.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 12, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report[110] of the Secretary of War, prepared in\r\ncompliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 26th\r\nultimo.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: Transmitting list of officers appointed in the Army\r\nsince June 1, 1843.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _March 18, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report[111] from the Secretary of State, in answer\r\nto the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 18th of January\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: Transmitting list of persons employed by the Department\r\nof State without express authority of law, etc., from March 4, 1837, to\r\nDecember 31, 1843, inclusive.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 19, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a letter[112] from the Secretary of State and\r\ncertain documents accompanying the same, in answer to the resolution\r\nof the Senate of the 8th instant.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: Transmitting the commission appointing Caleb Cushing a\r\nrepresentative of the Government of the United States in China;

also copies of the\r\ninstructions to and statements of the charter commissioners sent to him\r\nby the then existing authorities of the State of Rhode Island; also\r\ncopies of the correspondence between the Executive of the United States\r\nand the charter government of the State of Rhode Island, and all the\r\npapers and documents connected with the same; also copies of the\r\ncorrespondence, if any, between the heads of Departments and said\r\ncharter government or any person or persons connected with the said\r\ngovernment, and of any accompanying papers and documents;

that no orders were issued to naval officers to\r\nprepare steam or other vessels of the United States for service in the\r\nwaters of Rhode Island; that no orders were issued \"to the officers of\r\nthe revenue cutters for said service;\" that no instructions were borne\r\nby \"the Secretary of War to Rhode Island on his visit in 1842 _to review\r\nthe troops of the charter government_;\" that no orders were given to any\r\nofficer or officers of the Army or Navy to report themselves to the\r\ncharter government; that \"requests and applications\" were made to the\r\nExecutive to fulfill the guaranties of the Constitution which impose on\r\nthe Federal Government the obligation to protect and defend each State\r\nof the Union against \"domestic violence and foreign invasion,\" but the\r\nExecutive was at no time convinced that the _casus foederis_ had arisen\r\nwhich required the interposition of the military or naval power in the\r\ncontroversy which unhappily existed between the people of Rhode Island.\r\nI was in no manner prevented from so interfering by the inquiry whether\r\nRhode Island existed as an independent State of the Union under a\r\ncharter granted at an early period by the Crown of Great Britain or not.\r\nIt was enough for the Executive to know that she was recognized as a\r\nsovereign State by Great Britain by the treaty of 1783; that at a later\r\nday she had in common with her sister States poured out her blood and\r\nfreely expended her treasure in the War of the Revolution; that she was\r\na party to the Articles of Confederation; that at an after period she\r\nadopted the Constitution of the United States as a free, independent,\r\nand republican State; and that in this character she has always\r\npossessed her full quota of representation in the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives; and that up to a recent day she has conducted all her\r\ndomestic affairs and fulfilled all her obligations as a member of the\r\nUnion, in peace and war, under her _charter government_, as it is\r\ndenominated by the resolution of the House of the 23d March. I must be\r\npermitted to disclaim entirely and unqualifiedly the right on the part\r\nof the Executive to make any real or supposed defects existing in any\r\nState constitution or form of government the pretext for a failure to\r\nenforce the laws or the guaranties of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates in reference to any such State. I utterly repudiate the idea,\r\nin terms as emphatic as I can employ, that those laws are not to be\r\nenforced or those guaranties complied with because _the President_ may\r\nbelieve that the right of suffrage or any other great popular right\r\nis either too restricted or too broadly enlarged. I also with equal\r\nstrength resist the idea that it falls within the Executive competency\r\nto decide in controversies of the nature of that which existed in Rhode\r\nIsland on which side is the majority of the people or as to the extent\r\nof the rights of a mere numerical majority. For the Executive to assume\r\nsuch a power would be to assume a power of the most dangerous character.\r\nUnder such assumptions the States of this Union would have no security\r\nfor peace or tranquillity, but might be converted into the mere\r\ninstruments of Executive will. Actuated by selfish purposes, he might\r\nbecome the great agitator, fomenting assaults upon the State\r\nconstitutions and declaring the majority of to-day to be the minority\r\nof to-morrow, and the minority, in its turn, the majority, before whose\r\ndecrees the established order of things in the State should be\r\nsubverted. Revolution, civil commotion, and bloodshed would be the\r\ninevitable consequences. The provision in the Constitution intended for\r\nthe security of the States would thus be turned into the instrument\r\nof their destruction. The President would become, in fact, the great\r\n_constitution maker_ for the States, and all power would be vested\r\nin his hands.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the governor of Rhode Island, by his letter of the\r\n4th of April, 1842, made a requisition upon the Executive for aid to\r\nput down the late disturbances, I had no hesitation in recognizing the\r\nobligations of the Executive to furnish such aid upon the occurrence of\r\nthe contingency provided for by the Constitution and laws. My letter\r\nof the 11th of April, in reply to the governor's letter of the 4th, is\r\nherewith communicated, together with all correspondence which passed at\r\na subsequent day and the letters and documents mentioned in the schedule\r\nhereunto annexed. From the correspondence between the Executive of the\r\nUnited States and that of Rhode Island, it will not escape observation\r\nthat while I regarded it as my duty to announce the principles by which\r\nI should govern myself in the contingency of an armed interposition on\r\nthe part of this Government being necessary to uphold the rights of the\r\nState of Rhode Island and to preserve its domestic peace, yet that the\r\nstrong hope was indulged and expressed that all the difficulties would\r\ndisappear before an enlightened policy of conciliation and compromise.\r\nIn that spirit I addressed to Governor King the letter of the 9th of\r\nMay, 1842, marked \"private and confidential,\" and received his reply\r\nof the 12th of May of the same year. The desire of the Executive was\r\nfrom the beginning to bring the dispute to a termination without the\r\ninterposition of the military power of the United States, and it will\r\ncontinue to be a subject of self-congratulation that this leading\r\nobject of policy was finally accomplished. The Executive resisted\r\nall entreaties, however urgent, to depart from this line of conduct.\r\nInformation from private sources had led the Executive to conclude that\r\nlittle else was designed by Mr. Dorr and his adherents than mere menace\r\nwith a view to intimidation; nor was this opinion in any degree shaken\r\nuntil the 22d of June, 1842, when it was strongly represented from\r\nreliable sources, as will be seen by reference to the documents herewith\r\ncommunicated, that preparations were making by Mr. Dorr, with a large\r\nforce in arms, to invade the State, which force had been recruited in\r\nthe neighboring States and had been already preceded by the collection\r\nof military stores in considerable quantities at one or two points. This\r\nwas a state of things to which the Executive could not be indifferent.\r\nMr. Dorr speedily afterwards took up his headquarters at Chepachet and\r\nassumed the command of what was reported to be a large force, drawn\r\nchiefly from voluntary enlistments made in neighboring States. The\r\nExecutive could with difficulty bring itself to realize the fact that\r\nthe citizens of other States should have forgotten their duty to\r\nthemselves and the Constitution of the United States and have entered\r\ninto the highly reprehensible and indefensible course of interfering so\r\nfar in the concerns of a sister State as to have entered into plans of\r\ninvasion, conquest, and revolution; but the Executive felt it to be its\r\nduty to look minutely into the matter, and therefore the Secretary of\r\nWar was dispatched to Rhode Island with instructions (a copy of which is\r\nherewith transmitted), and was authorized, should a requisition be made\r\nupon the Executive by the government of Rhode Island in pursuance of\r\nlaw, and the invaders should not abandon their purposes, to call upon\r\nthe governors of Massachusetts and Connecticut for a sufficient number\r\nof militia at once to arrest the invasion and to interpose such of the\r\nregular troops as could be spared from Fort Adams for the defense of the\r\ncity of Providence in the event of its being attacked, as was strongly\r\nrepresented to be in contemplation. Happily there was no necessity for\r\neither issuing the proclamation or the requisition or for removing\r\nthe troops from Fort Adams, where they had been properly stationed.\r\nChepachet was evacuated and Mr. Dorr's troops dispersed without the\r\nnecessity of the interposition of any military force by this Government,\r\nthus confirming me in my early impressions that nothing more had been\r\ndesigned from the first by those associated with Mr. Dorr than to excite\r\nfear and apprehension and thereby to obtain concessions from the\r\nconstituted authorities which might be claimed as a triumph over the\r\nexisting government.\r\n\r\nWith the dispersion of Mr. Dorr's troops ended all difficulties.\r\nA convention was shortly afterwards called, by due course of law, to\r\namend the fundamental law, and a new constitution, based on more liberal\r\nprinciples than that abrogated, was proposed, and adopted by the people.\r\nThus the great American experiment of a change in government under the\r\ninfluence of opinion and not of force has been again crowned with\r\nsuccess, and the State and people of Rhode Island repose in safety under\r\ninstitutions of their own adoption, unterrified by any future prospect\r\nof necessary change and secure against domestic violence and invasion\r\nfrom abroad. I congratulate the country upon so happy a termination of\r\na condition of things which seemed at one time seriously to threaten the\r\npublic peace. It may justly be regarded as worthy of the age and of the\r\ncountry in which we live.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVIDENCE, _April 4, 1842_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: The State of Rhode Island is threatened with domestic violence.\r\nApprehending that the legislature can not be convened in sufficient\r\nseason to apply to the Government of the United States for effectual\r\nprotection in this case, I hereby apply to you, as the executive of\r\nthe State of Rhode Island, for the protection which is required by the\r\nConstitution of the United States. To communicate more fully with you\r\non this subject, I have appointed John Whipple, John Brown Francis, and\r\nElisha R. Potter, esqs., three of our most distinguished citizens, to\r\nproceed to Washington and to make known to you in behalf of this State\r\nthe circumstances which call for the interposition of the Government\r\nof the United States for our protection.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nSAM. W. KING,\r\n  _Governor of Rhode Island_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVIDENCE, _April 4, 1842_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: For nearly a year last past the State of Rhode Island has been\r\nagitated by revolutionary movements, and is now threatened with\r\ndomestic violence.\r\n\r\nThe report[116] of a joint committee of both branches of the legislature\r\nof this State, with an act[116] and resolutions[116] accompanying the\r\nsame, herewith communicated, were passed unanimously by the senate, and\r\nby a vote of 60 to 6 in the house of representatives. The legislature\r\nadjourned to the first Tuesday of May next.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: Omitted.]\r\n\r\nIt has become my duty by one of these resolutions to adopt such measures\r\nas in my opinion may be necessary in the recess of the legislature to\r\nexecute the laws and preserve the State from domestic violence.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the said act \"in relation to offenses against the\r\nsovereign power of this State\" have created much excitement among that\r\nportion of the people who have unequivocally declared their intention to\r\nset up another government in this State and to put down the existing\r\ngovernment, and they threaten, individually and collectively, to resist\r\nthe execution of this act. The numbers of this party are sufficiently\r\nformidable to threaten seriously our peace, and in some portions of the\r\nState, and in this city particularly, may constitute a majority of the\r\nphysical force, though they are a minority of the people of the State.\r\n\r\nUnder the dangers which now threaten us, I have appointed John Whipple,\r\nJohn Brown Francis, and Elisha R. Potter, esqs., three of our most\r\ndistinguished citizens, to proceed to Washington and consult with you in\r\nbehalf of this State, with a view that such precautionary measures may\r\nbe taken by the Government of the United States as may afford us that\r\nprotection which the Constitution of the United States requires. There\r\nis but little doubt that a proclamation from the President of the United\r\nStates and the presence here of a military officer to act under the\r\nauthority of the United States would destroy the delusion which is now\r\nso prevalent, and convince the deluded that in a contest with the\r\ngovernment of this State they would be involved in a contest with the\r\nGovernment of the United States, which could only eventuate in their\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nAs no State can keep troops in time of peace without the consent of\r\nCongress, there is the more necessity that we should be protected by\r\nthose who have the means of protection. We shall do all we can for\r\nourselves. The Government of the United States has the power to\r\n_prevent_ as well as to defend us from violence. The protection provided\r\nby the Constitution of the United States will not be effectual unless\r\nsuch precautionary measures may be taken as are necessary to prevent\r\nlawless men from breaking out into violence, as well as to protect the\r\nState from further violence after it has broken out. Preventive measures\r\nare the most prudent and safe, and also the most merciful.\r\n\r\nThe protective power would be lamentably deficient if \"the beginning\r\nof strife,\" which \"is like the letting out of waters,\" can not be\r\nprevented, and no protection can be afforded the State until to many\r\nit would be too late.\r\n\r\nThe above-named gentlemen are fully authorized to act in behalf of\r\nthe State of Rhode Island in this emergency, and carry with them\r\nsuch documents and proof as will, no doubt, satisfy you that the\r\ninterposition of the authority of the Government of the United States\r\nwill be salutary and effectual.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nSAM. W. KING,\r\n  _Governor of Rhode Island_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 9, 1842.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:[117] Will you do me the favor to see the committee from\r\nRhode Island as soon after the meeting of the Cabinet as may suit your\r\nconvenience?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: Addressed to the President of the United States.]\r\n\r\nI regret to learn from Mr. Francis that the leaning of your mind was\r\ndecidedly against any expression of opinion upon the subject, upon the\r\nground that _free suffrage_ must _prevail_. Undoubtedly it will. That\r\nis not the question. The freeholders of Rhode Island have yielded that\r\npoint, and the _only_ question is between their constitution, providing\r\nfor an extension of suffrage, and ours, containing _substantially_ the\r\n_same_ provision--whether their constitution shall be carried out by\r\n_force of arms without_ a majority, or the present government be\r\nsupported _until_ a constitution can be agreed upon that will command\r\na majority. Neither their constitution nor ours has as yet received a\r\nmajority of the free white males over 21 years of age. _There is no\r\ndoubt upon that subject_, and I very much regret that your mind should\r\nhave been influenced (if it has) by the paper called the Express. Nearly\r\nall the leaders who are professional men have abandoned them, on the\r\nground that a majority is not in favor of their constitution. I _know_\r\nthis to be true. I do hope that you will reconsider this vital question\r\nand give us a full hearing before you decide.\r\n\r\nWith great respect, very truly and sincerely, yours,\r\n\r\nJOHN WHIPPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Excellency JOHN TYLER,\r\n\r\n_President of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, having been deputed by Samuel W. King, the governor\r\nof the State of Rhode Island, to lay before you the present alarming\r\ncondition in which the people of that State are placed, and to request\r\nfrom you the adoption of such prudential measures as in your opinion may\r\ntend to prevent domestic violence, beg leave most respectfully to state\r\nthe following among the leading facts, to which your attention is more\r\nparticularly invited:\r\n\r\nThat the people of Rhode Island have no fundamental law except the\r\ncharter of King Charles II, granted in 1663, and the usage of the\r\nlegislature under it. Legislative usage under their charters has been\r\ndecided by the Supreme Court of the United States to be the fundamental\r\nlaw both in Connecticut and Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nThat from the date of the Rhode Island charter down to the year 1841, a\r\nperiod of nearly two hundred years, no person has been allowed to vote\r\nfor town or State offices unless possessed of competent estates and\r\nadmitted free in the several towns in which they resided.\r\n\r\nThat since the statute of 1728 no person could be admitted a freeman of\r\nany town unless he owned a freehold estate of the value fixed by law\r\n(now $134) or was the eldest son of such a freeholder.\r\n\r\nThat until the past year no attempt has been made, to our knowledge, to\r\nestablish any other fundamental law, by force, than the one under which\r\nthe people have lived for so long a period.\r\n\r\nThat at the January session of the legislature in 1841 a petition signed\r\nby five or six hundred male inhabitants, praying for such an extension\r\nof suffrage as the legislature might in their wisdom deem expedient to\r\npropose, was presented.\r\n\r\nThat, influenced by that petition, as well as by other considerations,\r\nthe legislature at that session requested the qualified voters, or\r\nfreemen, as they are called with us, to choose delegates at their\r\nregular town meetings to be holden in August, 1841, for a convention\r\nto be holden in November, 1841, to frame a written constitution.\r\n\r\nThat the result of the last meeting of this legal convention in\r\nFebruary, 1842, was the constitution[118] accompanying this statement,\r\nmarked ----, which, in case of its adoption by the people, would have\r\nbeen the supreme law of the State.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: Omitted.]\r\n\r\nMost of the above facts are contained in the printed report of a\r\nnumerous committee of the legislature at their session in March, 1842,\r\nwhich report was adopted by the legislature.\r\n\r\nThat in May, 1841, after said legal convention had been provided for\r\nby the legislature, and before the time appointed for the choice of\r\ndelegates by the qualified voters (August, 1841), a mass meeting was\r\nheld by the friends of an extension of suffrage at Newport, at which\r\nmeeting a committee was appointed, called the State committee, who were\r\nauthorized by said mass meeting to take measures for calling a\r\nconvention to frame a constitution.\r\n\r\nThat this committee, thus authorized, issued a request for a meeting\r\nof the male citizens in the several towns to appoint delegates to the\r\nproposed convention.\r\n\r\nThat meetings (of unqualified voters principally, as we believe) were\r\naccordingly holden in the several towns, unauthorized by law, and\r\ncontrary to the invariable custom and usage of the State from 1663 down\r\nto that period; that the aggregate votes appointing the delegates to\r\nthat convention were, according to their own estimate, about 7,200,\r\nwhereas the whole number of male citizens over 21 years of age, after\r\nmaking a deduction for foreigners, paupers, etc., was, according to\r\ntheir own estimate, over 22,000.\r\n\r\nThat this convention, thus constituted, convened in Providence in\r\nOctober, 1841, and the constitution called the \"people's constitution\"\r\nwas the result of their deliberations.\r\n\r\nThat at subsequent meetings of portions of the people in December, 1841,\r\nby the authority of this convention alone (elected, as its delegates had\r\nbeen, by about one-third of the voters, according to their own standard\r\nof qualification), all males over 21 years of age were admitted to vote\r\nfor the adoption of the people's constitution; that these meetings were\r\nnot under any presiding officer whose legal right or duty it was to\r\ninterpose any check or restraint as to age, residence, property, or\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nBy the fourteenth article of this constitution it was provided that\r\n\"this constitution shall be submitted to the people for their adoption\r\nor rejection on Monday, the 27th of December next, and on the two\r\nsucceeding days;\" \"and every person entitled to vote as aforesaid who\r\nfrom sickness or _other causes_ may be unable to attend and vote in the\r\ntown or ward meetings assembled for voting upon said constitution on the\r\ndays aforesaid is requested to write his name on a ticket, and to obtain\r\nthe signature upon the back of the same of a person who has given in his\r\nvote, as a witness thereto, and the moderator or clerk of any town or\r\nward meeting convened for the purpose aforesaid shall receive such vote\r\non either of the three days next succeeding the three days before named\r\nfor voting for said constitution.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the first three days about 9,000 votes were received from the\r\nhands of the voters in the open meetings. By the privilege granted\r\nto any and all friends of the constitution of _bringing into_ their\r\nmeetings the _names_ of voters during the three following days 5,000\r\nvotes more were obtained, making an aggregate of about 14,000 votes.\r\n\r\nThis constitution, thus originating and thus formed, was subsequently\r\ndeclared by this convention to be the supreme law of the land. By its\r\nprovisions a government is to be organized under it, by the choice of\r\na governor, lieutenant-governor, senators and representatives, on the\r\nMonday preceding the third Wednesday in April, 1842.\r\n\r\nBy the provisions of the \"landholder's constitution,\" as the legal\r\nconstitution is called, every white native citizen possessing the\r\nfreehold qualification, and over 21 years of age, may vote upon a\r\nresidence of _one_ year, and without any freehold may vote upon a\r\nresidence of _two_ years, except in the case of votes for town taxes,\r\nin which case the voter must possess the freehold qualification _or_\r\nbe taxed for other property of the value of $150.\r\n\r\nBy the \"people's constitution\" \"every white male citizen of the United\r\nStates of the age of 21 years who has resided in this State for _one_\r\nyear and in the town where he votes for six months\" shall be permitted\r\nto vote, with the same exception as to voting for town taxes as is\r\ncontained in the other constitution.\r\n\r\nThe provision, therefore, in relation to the great subject in\r\ndispute--the elective franchise--is substantially the same in the two\r\nconstitutions.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st, 22d, and 23d March last the legal constitution, by an\r\nact of the legislature, was submitted to all the persons who by its\r\nprovisions would be entitled to vote under it after its adoption, for\r\ntheir ratification. It was rejected by a majority of 676 votes, the\r\nnumber of votes polled being over 16,000. It is believed that many\r\nfreeholders voted against it because they were attached to the old form\r\nof government and were against any new constitution whatever. Both\r\nparties used uncommon exertions to bring all their voters to the polls,\r\nand the result of the vote was, under the scrutiny of opposing interests\r\nin legal town meetings, that the friends of the people's constitution\r\nbrought to the polls probably not over 7,000 to 7,500 votes. The whole\r\nvote against the legal constitution was about 8,600. If we allow 1,000\r\nas the number of freeholders who voted against the legal constitution\r\nbecause they are opposed to any constitution, it would leave the number\r\nof the friends of the people's constitution 7,600, or about one-third of\r\nthe voters of the State under the new qualification proposed by either\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nIt seems incredible that there can be 14,000 friends of the people's\r\nconstitution in the State, animated as they are by a most extraordinary\r\nand enthusiastic feeling; and yet upon this trial, in the usual open and\r\nfair way of voting, they should have obtained not over 7,600 votes.\r\n\r\nThe unanimity of the subsequent action of the legislature, comprehending\r\nas it did both the great political parties--the house of representatives\r\ngiving a vote of 60 in favor of maintaining the existing government of\r\nthe State and only 6 on the other side, with a unaminimous vote in the\r\nsenate--the unanimous and decided opinion of the supreme court declaring\r\nthis extraordinary movement to be illegal in all its stages (see\r\n----[119]), a majority of that court being of the Democratic party, with\r\nother facts of a similar character, have freed this question of a mere\r\nparty character and enabled us to present it as a great constitutional\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nWithout presuming to discuss the elementary and fundamental principles\r\nof government, we deem it our duty to remind you of the fact that the\r\nexisting government of Rhode Island is _the_ government that adopted the\r\nConstitution of the United States, became a member of this Confederacy,\r\nand has ever since been represented in the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives. It is at this moment the existing government of Rhode\r\nIsland, both _de facto_ and _dejure_, and is the only government in that\r\nState entitled to the protection of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIt is that government which now calls upon the General Government for\r\nits interference; and even if the legal effect of there being an\r\nascertained majority of unqualified voters against the existing\r\ngovernment was as is contended for by the opposing party, yet, upon\r\ntheir own principle, ought not that majority in point of fact to be\r\nclearly ascertained, not by assertion, but by proof, in order to justify\r\nthe General Government in withdrawing its legal and moral influence to\r\nprevent domestic violence?\r\n\r\nThat a domestic war of the most furious character will speedily ensue\r\nunless prevented by a prompt expression of opinion here can not be\r\ndoubted. In relation to this, we refer to the numerous resolutions\r\npassed at meetings of the friends of the people's constitution, and more\r\nespecially to the Cumberland resolutions[119] herewith presented, and\r\nthe affidavits,[119] marked ----, and to repeated expressions of similar\r\nreliance upon the judgment of the Chief Magistrate of the nation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: Omitted.]\r\n\r\nAll which is respectfully submitted by--\r\n\r\nJOHN WHIPPLE.\r\n  JOHN BROWN FRANCIS.\r\n    ELISHA R. POTTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 11, 1842_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency the GOVERNOR OF RHODE ISLAND.\r\n\r\nSIR: Your letter dated the 4th instant was handed me on Friday by Mr.\r\nWhipple, who, in company with Mr. Francis and Mr. Potter, called upon me\r\non Saturday and placed me, both verbally and in writing, in possession\r\nof the prominent facts which have led to the present unhappy condition\r\nof things in Rhode Island--a state of things which every lover of peace\r\nand good order must deplore. I shall not adventure the expression of an\r\nopinion upon those questions of domestic policy which seem to have given\r\nrise to the unfortunate controversies between a portion of the citizens\r\nand the existing government of the State. They are questions of\r\nmunicipal regulation, the adjustment of which belongs exclusively to the\r\npeople of Rhode Island, and with which this Government can have nothing\r\nto do. For the regulation of my conduct in any interposition which I may\r\nbe called upon to make between the government of a State and any portion\r\nof its citizens who may assail it with domestic violence, or may be in\r\nactual insurrection against it, I can only look to the Constitution and\r\nlaws of the United States, which plainly declare the obligations of the\r\nexecutive department and leave it no alternative as to the course it\r\nshall pursue.\r\n\r\nBy the fourth section of the fourth article of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States it is provided that \"the United States shall guarantee to\r\nevery State in this Union a republican form of government, and shall\r\nprotect each of them against invasion, and, on application of the\r\nlegislature or executive (when the legislature can not be convened),\r\n_against domestic violence_.\" And by the act of Congress approved on the\r\n28th February, 1795, it is declared \"that in case of an insurrection in\r\nany State _against the government thereof_ it shall be lawful for the\r\nPresident of the United States, upon application of the legislature\r\nof such State or by the executive (when the legislature can not be\r\nconvened), to call forth such numbers of the militia of any other State\r\nor States as may be applied for, as he may judge sufficient to suppress\r\nsuch insurrection.\" By the third section of the same act it is provided\r\n\"that whenever it may be necessary, in the judgment of the President, to\r\nuse the military force hereby directed to be called forth, the President\r\nshall forthwith, by proclamation, command such insurgents to disperse\r\nand retire peaceably to their respective abodes within a reasonable\r\ntime.\" By the act of March 3, 1807, it is provided \"that in all cases of\r\ninsurrection or obstruction to the laws, either of the United States\r\nor of any individual State or Territory where it is lawful for the\r\nPresident of the United States to call forth the militia for the purpose\r\nof suppressing such insurrection or of causing the laws to be duly\r\nexecuted, it shall be lawful for him to employ for the same purposes\r\nsuch part of the land or naval force of the United States as shall be\r\njudged necessary, having first observed all the prerequisites of the\r\nlaw in that respect.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the first occasion, so far as the government of a State and its\r\npeople are concerned, on which it has become necessary to consider of\r\nthe propriety of exercising those high and most important of\r\nconstitutional and legal functions.\r\n\r\nBy a careful consideration of the above-recited acts of Congress your\r\nexcellency will not fail to see that no power is vested in the Executive\r\nof the United States to anticipate insurrectionary movements against the\r\ngovernment of Rhode Island so as to sanction the interposition of the\r\nmilitary authority, but that there must be an actual insurrection,\r\nmanifested by lawless assemblages of the people or otherwise, to whom\r\na proclamation may be addressed and who may be required to betake\r\nthemselves to their respective abodes. I have, however, to assure your\r\nexcellency that should the time arrive--and my fervent prayer is\r\nthat it may never come--when an insurrection shall exist _against the\r\ngovernment_ of Rhode Island, and a requisition shall be made upon the\r\nExecutive of the United States to furnish that protection which is\r\nguaranteed to each State by the Constitution and laws, I shall not be\r\nfound to shrink from the performance of a duty which, while it would be\r\nthe most painful, is at the same time the most imperative. I have also\r\nto say that in such a contingency the Executive could not look into real\r\nor supposed defects of the existing government in order to ascertain\r\nwhether some other plan of government proposed for adoption was better\r\nsuited to the wants and more in accordance with the wishes of any\r\nportion of her citizens. To throw the Executive power of this Government\r\ninto any such controversy would be to make the President the armed\r\narbitrator between the people of the different States and their\r\nconstituted authorities, and might lead to a usurped power dangerous\r\nalike to the stability of the State governments and the liberties of the\r\npeople. It will be my duty, on the contrary, to respect the requisitions\r\nof that government which has been recognized as the existing government\r\nof the State through all time past until I shall be advised in regular\r\nmanner that it has been altered and abolished and another substituted in\r\nits place by legal and peaceable proceedings adopted and pursued by the\r\nauthorities and people of the State. Nor can I readily bring myself\r\nto believe that any such contingency will arise as shall render the\r\ninterference of this Government at all necessary. The people of the\r\nState of Rhode Island have been too long distinguished for their love\r\nof order and of regular government to rush into revolution in order to\r\nobtain a redress of grievances, real or supposed, which a government\r\nunder which their fathers lived in peace would not in due season\r\nredress. No portion of her people will be willing to drench her fair\r\nfields with the blood of their own brethren in order to obtain a redress\r\nof grievances which their constituted authorities can not for any length\r\nof time resist if properly appealed to by the popular voice. None of\r\nthem will be willing to set an example, in the bosom of this Union, of\r\nsuch frightful disorder, such needless convulsions of society, such\r\ndanger to life, liberty, and property, and likely to bring so much\r\ndiscredit on the character of popular governments. My reliance on the\r\nvirtue, intelligence, and patriotism of her citizens is great and\r\nabiding, and I will not doubt but that a spirit of conciliation will\r\nprevail over rash councils, that all actual grievances will be promptly\r\nredressed by the existing government, and that another bright example\r\nwill be added to the many already prevailing among the North American\r\nRepublics of change without revolution and a redress of grievances\r\nwithout force or violence.\r\n\r\nI tender to your excellency assurances of my high respect and\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWPORT, R.I., _May 4, 1842_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency JOHN TYLER,\r\n\r\n_President of the United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I transmit herewith certain resolutions passed by the general\r\nassembly of this State at their session holden at Newport on the first\r\nWednesday of May instant.\r\n\r\nYou are already acquainted with some of the circumstances which have\r\nrendered necessary the passage of these resolutions. Any further\r\ninformation that may be desired will be communicated by the bearers, the\r\nHon. Richard K. Randolph, speaker of the house of representatives, and\r\nElisha R. Potter, esq., a member of the senate of this State.\r\n\r\nI can not allow myself to doubt but that the assistance to which this\r\nState is entitled under the Constitution of the United States, to\r\nprotect itself against domestic violence, will be promptly rendered by\r\nthe General Government of the Union.\r\n\r\nWith great respect, I am, Your Excellency's humble servant,\r\n\r\nSAM. W. KING,\r\n  _Governor of Rhode Island_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS,\r\n  _In General Assembly, May Session, 1842_.\r\n\r\nWhereas a portion of the people of this State, for the purpose of\r\nsubverting the laws and existing government thereof, have framed a\r\npretended constitution, and for the same unlawful purposes have met in\r\nlawless assemblages and elected officers for the future government of\r\nthis State; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the persons so elected in violation of law, but in conformity to\r\nthe said pretended constitution, have, on the 3d day of May instant,\r\norganized themselves into executive and legislative departments of\r\ngovernment, and under oath assumed the duties and exercise of said\r\npowers; and\r\n\r\nWhereas in order to prevent the due execution of the laws a strong\r\nmilitary force was called out and did array themselves to protect the\r\nsaid unlawful organization of government and to set at defiance the due\r\nenforcement of law: Therefore,\r\n\r\n_Resolved by the general assembly_, That there now exists in this State\r\nan insurrection against the laws and constituted authorities thereof,\r\nand that, in pursuance of the Constitution and laws of the United\r\nStates, a requisition be, and hereby is, made by this legislature upon\r\nthe President of the United States forthwith to interpose the authority\r\nand power of the United States to suppress such insurrectionary and\r\nlawless assemblages, to support the existing government and laws, and\r\nprotect the State from domestic violence.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That his excellency the governor be requested immediately to\r\ntransmit a copy of these resolutions to the President of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nTrue copy.\r\n\r\nWitness: HENRY BOWEN,\r\n  _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 7, 1842_.\r\n\r\nThe GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND.\r\n\r\nSIR: Your letter of the 4th instant, transmitting resolutions of the\r\nlegislature of Rhode Island, informing me that there existed in that\r\nState \"certain lawless assemblages of a portion of the people\" \"for\r\nthe purpose of subverting the laws and over-throwing the existing\r\ngovernment,\" and calling upon the Executive \"forthwith to interpose\r\nthe authority and power of the United States to suppress such\r\ninsurrectionary and lawless assemblages and to support the existing\r\ngovernment and laws and protect the State from domestic violence,\"\r\nwas handed me on yesterday by Messrs. Randolph and Potter.\r\n\r\nI have to inform your excellency in reply that my opinions as to the\r\nduties of this Government to protect the State of Rhode Island against\r\ndomestic violence remain unchanged. Yet, from information received by\r\nthe Executive since your dispatches came to hand I am led to believe\r\nthat the lawless assemblages to which reference is made have already\r\ndispersed and that the danger of domestic violence is hourly\r\ndiminishing, if it has not wholly disappeared. I have with difficulty\r\nbrought myself at any time to believe that violence would be resorted\r\nto or an exigency arise which the unaided power of the State could not\r\nmeet, especially as I have from the first felt persuaded that your\r\nexcellency and others associated with yourself in the administration\r\nof the government would exhibit a temper of conciliation as well as\r\nof energy and decision. To the insurgents themselves it ought to be\r\nobvious, when the excitement of the moment shall have passed away, that\r\nchanges achieved by regular and, if necessary, repeated appeals to the\r\nconstituted authorities, in a country so much under the influence of\r\npublic opinion, and by recourse to argument and remonstrance, are more\r\nlikely to insure lasting blessings than those accomplished by violence\r\nand bloodshed on one day, and liable to overthrow by similar agents on\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nI freely confess that I should experience great reluctance in employing\r\nthe military power of this Government against any portion of the people;\r\nbut however painful the duty, I have to assure your excellency that if\r\nresistance be made to the execution of the laws of Rhode Island by such\r\nforce as the _civil power_ shall be unable to overcome, it will be the\r\nduty of this Government to enforce the constitutional guaranty--a\r\nguaranty given and adopted mutually by all the original States, of which\r\nnumber Rhode Island was one, and which in the same way has been given\r\nand adopted by each of the States since admitted into the Union; and\r\nif an exigency of lawless violence shall actually arise the executive\r\ngovernment of the United States, on the application of your excellency\r\nunder the authority of the resolutions of the legislature already\r\ntransmitted, will stand ready to succor the authorities of the State in\r\ntheir efforts to maintain a due respect for the laws. I sincerely hope,\r\nhowever, that no such exigency may occur, and that every citizen of\r\nRhode Island will manifest his love of peace and good order by\r\nsubmitting to the laws and seeking a redress of grievances by other\r\nmeans than intestine commotions.\r\n\r\nI tender to your excellency assurances of my distinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER,\r\n\r\n_President of the United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: As requested by the general assembly, I have the honor of\r\ntransmitting to you, under the seal of the State, the accompanying\r\nresolutions.\r\n\r\nAnd I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nTHOMAS W. DORR,\r\n  _Governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS,\r\n  _General Assembly, May Session, in the City of Providence, A.D. 1842_.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the governor be requested to inform the President\r\nof the United States that the government of this State has been duly\r\nelected and organized under the constitution of the same, and that the\r\ngeneral assembly are now in session and proceeding to discharge their\r\nduties according to the provisions of said constitution.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the governor be requested to make the same\r\ncommunication to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, to be laid before the two Houses of the\r\nCongress of the United States.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the governor be requested to make the same\r\ncommunication to the governors of the several States, to be laid before\r\nthe respective legislatures.\r\n\r\nA true copy.\r\n\r\nWitness:\r\n  [L.S.] WM. H. SMITH,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY 9, 1842.\r\n\r\nGovernor KING, _of Rhode Island_.\r\n\r\nSIR: Messrs. Randolph and Potter will hand you an official letter, but I\r\nthink it important that you should be informed of my views and opinions\r\nas to the best mode of settling all difficulties. I deprecate the use of\r\nforce except in the last resort, and I am persuaded that measures of\r\nconciliation will at once operate to produce quiet. _I am well advised_,\r\nif the general assembly would authorize you to announce a general\r\namnesty and pardon for the past, without making any exception, upon the\r\ncondition of a return to allegiance, and follow it up by a call for a\r\nnew convention upon somewhat liberal principles, that all difficulty\r\nwould at once cease. And why should not this be done? A government never\r\nloses anything by mildness and forbearance to its own citizens, more\r\nespecially when the consequences of an opposite course may be the\r\nshedding of blood. In your case the one-half of your people are involved\r\nin the consequences of recent proceedings. Why urge matters to an\r\nextremity? If you succeed by the bayonet, you succeed against your own\r\nfellow-citizens and by the shedding of kindred blood, whereas by taking\r\nthe opposite course you will have shown a paternal care for the lives of\r\nyour people. My own opinion is that the adoption of the above measures\r\nwill give you peace and insure you harmony. A resort to force, on the\r\ncontrary, will engender for years to come feelings of animosity.\r\n\r\nI have said that I _speak advisedly_. Try the experiment, and if it fail\r\nthen your justification in using force becomes complete.\r\n\r\nExcuse the freedom I take, and be assured of my respect.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVIDENCE, R.I., _May 12, 1842_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency the PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR: I have had the honor to receive your communication of\r\n9th instant by Mr. Randolph, and assure you it has given me much\r\nsatisfaction to know that your views and opinions as to the course\r\nproper to be pursued by the government of this State in the present\r\nunhappy condition of our political affairs is so much in conformity\r\nwith my own.\r\n\r\nOur legislature will undoubtedly at their session in June next adopt\r\nsuch measures as will be necessary to organize a convention for the\r\nformation of a new constitution of government, by which all the evils\r\nnow complained of may be removed.\r\n\r\nIt has already been announced as the opinion of the executive that\r\nsuch of our citizens as are or have been engaged in treasonable and\r\nrevolutionary designs against the State will be pardoned for the past on\r\nthe condition only that they withdraw themselves from such enterprise\r\nand signify their return to their allegiance to the government.\r\n\r\nWith high consideration and respect, your obedient and very humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nSAM. W. KING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKINGSTON, R.I. _May 15, 1842_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency JOHN TYLER,\r\n\r\n_President of the United States_.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: We arrived at Newport on Wednesday morning in time to attend\r\nthe meeting of our legislature.\r\n\r\nThe subject of calling a convention immediately, and upon a liberal\r\nbasis as to the right of voting for the delegates, was seriously\r\nagitated amongst us. The only objection made was that they did not wish\r\nto concede while the _people's party_ continued _their threats_. All\r\nallowed that the concession must be made, and the only difference of\r\nopinion was as to time.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I fear we shall never see the time when concession\r\ncould have been made with better grace or with better effect than now.\r\nIf two or three _noisy_ folks among the suffrage party could only have\r\ntheir mouths stopped for a week or two, a reconciliation could be\r\nbrought about at any time, or if Mr. Dorr would allow himself to be\r\narrested peaceably and give bail no one could then object. But the\r\nsupporters of the government say it is wrong to give up so long as Mr.\r\nDorr threatens actual resistance to the laws in case he is arrested. If\r\nthis could be done, they would then consider that they had sufficiently\r\nshown their determination to support the laws, and the two measures\r\nwhich you proposed to us in conversation at Washington--a convention and\r\nthen a _general_ amnesty--would succeed beyond a doubt.\r\n\r\nAllow me to suggest that if Mr. Wickliffe, or someone who you might\r\nthink would have most influence, would address a letter to Governor\r\nFenner on the subject of conciliation it might be of great service.\r\nGovernor F. is the father-in-law of General Mallett and a member of\r\nour senate.\r\n\r\nOur assembly adjourned to the third Monday of June, but it is in the\r\npower of the governor to call it sooner, which can be done in a day at\r\nany time. Unless, however, there is a little more _prudence_ in the\r\n_leaders_ on both sides, we shall then be farther from reconciliation\r\nthan now. The great mass of both parties I believe to be sincerely\r\nanxious for a settlement.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether a letter addressed to the President upon a subject\r\nof this nature would of course be considered as public and liable to\r\ninspection. Few would write freely if that were the case. If private, I\r\nwill cheerfully communicate from time to time any information that may\r\nbe in my power and which might be of any service.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nELISHA R. POTTER.\r\n\r\nMr. Dorr returned to Providence this (Monday) morning with an armed\r\nescort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 20, 1842_.\r\n\r\nELISHA R. POTTER, Esq.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: You have my thanks for your favor of the 16th [15th] instant,\r\nand I have to request that you will write to me without reserve whenever\r\nanything of importance shall arise. My chief motives for desiring the\r\nadoption of the measures suggested to you, viz, a general amnesty and a\r\ncall of a convention, were, first, because I felt convinced that peace\r\nand harmony would follow in their train, and, secondly, if in this I was\r\ndisappointed the insurgents would have had no longer a pretense for an\r\nappeal to the public sympathies in their behalf. I saw nothing to\r\ndegrade or to give rise to injurious reflections against the government\r\nof the State for resorting to every proper expedient in order to quiet\r\nthe disaffection of any portion of her own people. Family quarrels are\r\nalways the most difficult to appease, but everybody will admit that\r\nthose of the family who do most to reconcile them are entitled to the\r\ngreatest favor. Mr. Dorr's recent proceedings have been of so\r\nextravagant a character as almost to extinguish the last hope of a\r\npeaceable result, and yet I can not but believe that much is meant for\r\neffect and for purposes of intimidation merely. I certainly hope that\r\nsuch may be the case, though the recent proceedings in New York may have\r\nexcited new feelings and new desires. This mustering of the clans may\r\nplace Governor King in a different situation from that which he occupied\r\nwhen I had the pleasure of seeing you. _Then_ he might have yielded with\r\ngrace; whether he can do so now is certainly a question of much\r\ndifficulty and one on which I can not venture to express an opinion at\r\nthis distance from the scene of action.\r\n\r\nI shall be always most happy to hear from you, and your letters will\r\nnever be used to your prejudice.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my high respect.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVIDENCE, _May 16, 1842_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: At the request of Governor King, I inclose to you an extra of the\r\nProvidence Daily Express of this morning, containing the proclamation\r\nof Thomas W. Dorr to the people of this State.\r\n\r\nIt states definitely the position assumed by him and his faction against\r\nthe government of this State and of the United States.\r\n\r\nHis excellency tenders to you the highest respect and consideration.\r\n\r\nRespectfully, yours,\r\n\r\nTHOS. A. JENCKES,\r\n  _Private Secretary_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS W. DORR, GOVERNOR AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE SAME.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS: Shortly after the adjournment of the general assembly\r\nand the completion of indispensable executive business I was induced by\r\nthe request of the most active friends of our cause to undertake the\r\nduty (which had been previously suggested) of representing in person the\r\ninterests of the people of Rhode Island in other States and at the seat\r\nof the General Government. By virtue of a resolution of the general\r\nassembly, I appointed Messrs. Pearce and Anthony commissioners for the\r\nsame purpose.\r\n\r\nOf the proposed action of the Executive in the affairs of our State you\r\nhave been already apprised. In case of the failure of the civil posse\r\n(which expression was intended by the President, as I have been\r\ninformed, to embrace the military power) to execute any of the laws of\r\nthe charter assembly, including their law of pains and penalties and of\r\ntreason, as it has been for the first time defined, the President\r\nintimates an intention of resorting to the forces of the United States\r\nto check the movements of the people of this State in support of their\r\nrepublican constitution recently adopted.\r\n\r\nFrom a decision which conflicts with the right of sovereignty inherent\r\nin the people of this State and with the principles which lie at the\r\nfoundation of a democratic republic an appeal has been taken to the\r\npeople of our country. They understand our cause; they sympathize in the\r\ninjuries which have been inflicted upon us; they disapprove the course\r\nwhich the National Executive has adopted toward this State, and they\r\nassure us of their disposition and intention to interpose a barrier\r\nbetween the supporters of the people's constitution and the hired\r\nsoldiery of the United States. The democracy of the country are slow to\r\nmove in any matter which involves an issue so momentous as that which is\r\npresented by the controversy in Rhode Island, but when they have once\r\nput themselves in motion they are not to be easily diverted from their\r\npurposes. They believe that the people of Rhode Island are in the right;\r\nthat they are contending for equal justice in their political system;\r\nthat they have properly adopted a constitution of government for\r\nthemselves, as they were entitled to do, and they can not and will\r\nnot remain indifferent to any act, from whatever motive it may\r\nproceed, which they deem to be an invasion of the sacred right of\r\nself-government, of which the people of the respective States can not\r\nbe divested.\r\n\r\nAs your representative I have been everywhere received with the utmost\r\nkindness and cordiality. To the people of the city of New York, who have\r\nextended to us the hand of a generous fraternity, it is impossible to\r\noverrate our obligation at this most important crisis.\r\n\r\nIt has become my duty to say that so soon as a soldier of the United\r\nStates shall be set in motion, by whatever direction, to act against the\r\npeople of this State in aid of the charter government I shall call for\r\nthat aid to oppose all such force, which, I am fully authorized to say,\r\nwill be immediately and most cheerfully tendered to the service of the\r\npeople of Rhode Island from the city of New York and from other places.\r\nThe contest will then become national, and our State the battle ground\r\nof American freedom.\r\n\r\nAs a Rhode Island man I regret that the constitutional question in this\r\nState can not be adjusted among our own citizens, but as the minority\r\nhave asked that the sword of the National Executive may be thrown into\r\nthe scale against the people, it is imperative upon them to make the\r\nsame appeal to their brethren of the States--an appeal which they are\r\nwell assured will not be made in vain. They who have been the first to\r\nask assistance from abroad can have no reason to complain of any\r\nconsequences which may ensue.\r\n\r\nNo further arrests under the law of pains and penalties, which was\r\nrepealed by the general assembly of the people at their May session,\r\nwill be permitted. I hereby direct the military, under their respective\r\nofficers, promptly to prevent the same and to release all who may be\r\narrested under said law.\r\n\r\nAs requested by the general assembly, I enjoin upon the militia\r\nforthwith to elect their company officers; and I call upon volunteers to\r\norganize themselves without delay. The military are directed to hold\r\nthemselves in readiness for immediate service.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the State, at the city of\r\nProvidence, this 6th day of May, A.D. 1842.\r\n\r\n[L.S.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS W. DORR,\r\n\r\n  _Governor and Commander in Chief of the State of Rhode Island and\r\nProvidence Plantations_\r\n\r\nBy the governor's command:\r\n  WILLIAM H. SMITH,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVIDENCE, R.I., _May 25, 1842_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: Since my last communication the surface of things in this city and\r\nState has been more quiet. The complete dispersing of the insurgents and\r\nflight of their leader on Wednesday last, 18th instant, seem to have\r\nbroken their strength and prevented them from making head openly in any\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nBut another crisis now appears to be approaching. By the private\r\nadvices received by myself and the council from our messengers in the\r\nneighboring States we learn that Dorr and his agents are enlisting men\r\nand collecting arms for the purpose of again attempting to subvert, by\r\nopen war, the government of this State. Those who have assisted him\r\nat home in his extreme measures are again holding secret councils and\r\nmaking preparations to rally on his return. Companies of men pledged to\r\nsupport him have met and drilled in the north part of this State during\r\nthe present week.\r\n\r\nFrom the forces which he can collect among our own citizens we have\r\nnothing to fear. Our own military strength has once scattered them, and\r\ncould as easily do so a second time. But if the bands which are now\r\norganizing in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New York should make the\r\nincursion which they threaten, with Dorr at their head, we have reason\r\nto apprehend a civil war of the most destructive and vindictive\r\ncharacter. Our own forces might be sufficient to repel them, but having\r\nlittle discipline and no officer of military experience to lead them,\r\nthey could not do it without the loss of many valuable lives.\r\n\r\nFor the evidence that such forces are organizing in other States, I\r\nrefer Your Excellency to a letter from Governor Seward, of New York, and\r\nto a statement made by one of our messengers to the council, which will\r\nbe handed you. Other messengers confirm to the fullest extent the same\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nIn this posture of affairs I deem it my duty to call upon Your\r\nExcellency for the support guaranteed by the Constitution and laws of\r\nthe United States to this government. I would submit to Your Excellency\r\nwhether a movement of a sufficient body of troops to this quarter, to be\r\nstationed at Fort Adams, and to be subject to the requisitions of the\r\nexecutive of this State whenever in his opinion the exigency should\r\narise to require their assistance, would not be the best measure to\r\ninsure peace and respect for the laws and to deter invasions.\r\n\r\nYou will see by the statement[120] of the secret agent of the government\r\nthat the time set for this incursion is very near. The mustering of the\r\ninsurgents and their movement upon the city will probably be with the\r\ngreatest expedition when once commenced--in a time too short for a\r\nmessenger to reach Washington and return with aid. I therefore make this\r\napplication before any movement of magnitude on their part, in order\r\nthat we may be prepared at the briefest notice to quell domestic\r\ninsurrection and repel invasion.\r\n\r\nSAM. W. KING\r\n  _Governor of Rhode Island_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: Omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Albany, May 22, 1842_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency SAMUEL WARD KING,\r\n\r\n_Governor of Rhode Island_.\r\n\r\nSIR: In compliance with your excellency's requisition, I have this day\r\nissued a warrant for the arrest of Thomas Wilson Dorr, esq., charged in\r\nRhode Island with the crime of treason. The warrant will be delivered to\r\na police officer of this city, who will attend Colonel Pitman and be\r\nadvised by him in regard to the arrest of the fugitive should he be\r\nfound in this State.\r\n\r\nMay I be allowed to suggest to your excellency that a detention of the\r\naccused in this State would be liable to misapprehension, and if it\r\nshould be in a particular region of this State might, perhaps, result in\r\nan effort to rescue him. Therefore it seems to be quite important that\r\nyour excellency should without delay designate, by a communication to\r\nme, an agent to receive the fugitive and convey him to Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very high respect and consideration, your\r\nexcellency's obedient servant,\r\n\r\nWILLIAM H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _May 28, 1842_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency Governor KING.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have received your excellency's communication of the 25th\r\ninstant, informing me of efforts making by Mr. Dorr and others to embody\r\na force in the contiguous States for the invasion of the State of Rhode\r\nIsland, and calling upon the Executive of the United States for military\r\naid.\r\n\r\nIn answer I have to inform your excellency that means have been taken\r\nto ascertain the extent of the dangers of any armed invasion by the\r\ncitizens of other States of the State of Rhode Island, either to put\r\ndown her government or to disturb her peace. The apparent improbability\r\nof a violation so flagrant and unprecedented of all our laws and\r\ninstitutions makes me, I confess, slow to believe that any serious\r\nattempts will be made to execute the designs which some evil-minded\r\npersons may have formed.\r\n\r\nBut should the necessity of the case require the interposition of the\r\nauthority of the United States it will be rendered in the manner\r\nprescribed by the laws.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I indulge a confident expectation, founded upon the\r\nrecent manifestations of public opinion in your State in favor of law\r\nand order, that your own resources and means will be abundantly adequate\r\nto preserve the public peace, and that the difficulties which have\r\narisen will be soon amicably and permanently adjusted by the exercise\r\nof a spirit of liberality and forbearance.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War will issue a private order to Colonel Bankhead,\r\ncommanding at Newport, to employ, if necessary, a private and\r\nconfidential person or persons to go into all such places and among\r\nall such persons as he may have reason to believe to be likely to give\r\nany information touching Rhode Island affairs, and to report with the\r\ngreatest dispatch, if necessary, to the President. He will also address\r\na letter to General Wool conveying to him the fears entertained of a\r\nhostile invasion contemplated to place Dorr in the chair of state of\r\nRhode Island by persons in the States of Connecticut and New York,\r\nand also to General Eustis, at Boston, of a similar character, with\r\ninstructions to adopt such inquiries (to be secretly made) as they may\r\ndeem necessary, and to report with the greatest dispatch all information\r\nwhich from time to time they may acquire.\r\n\r\n(Indorsed: \"President's instructions, May 28, 1842.\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, _May 28, 1842_.\r\n\r\nColonel BANKHEAD,\r\n\r\n_Newport, R.I._\r\n\r\nSIR: The governor of Rhode Island has represented to the President that\r\npreparations are making by Mr. Dorr and some of his adherents to recruit\r\nmen in the neighboring States for the purpose of supporting his\r\nusurpation of the powers of government, and that he has provided arms\r\nand camp equipage for a large number of men. It is very important that\r\nwe should have accurate information on this subject, and particularly in\r\nrelation to the movements made in other States. I have therefore to\r\ndesire you to employ proper persons to go to the places where it may be\r\nsupposed such preparations are making to possess themselves fully of all\r\nthat is doing and in contemplation, and report frequently to you. It is\r\nsaid that Mr. Dorr's principal headquarters are at the town of Thompson,\r\nin the State of Connecticut. It may be well for you to communicate\r\npersonally with Governor King and ascertain from him the points and\r\nplaces at which any preparations for embodying men are supposed to be\r\nmaking, and to direct your inquiries accordingly.\r\n\r\nIt is important that you should select persons on whose integrity and\r\naccuracy the fullest reliance can be placed. They should not be\r\npartisans on either side, although to effect the object it will of\r\ncourse be necessary that some of them should obtain (if they do not\r\nalready possess) the confidence of the friends of Mr. Dorr. You will\r\nplease communicate directly to me all the information you obtain, and\r\nyour own views of it.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to say that this communication is of the most\r\nprivate and confidential character, and is not to be made known to\r\nanyone.\r\n\r\nRespectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJ.C. SPENCER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, _May 29, 1842_.\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General EUSTIS,\r\n\r\n_Boston_.\r\n\r\nSIR: The governor of Rhode Island has represented to the President that\r\npreparations are making in other States (particularly in Massachusetts)\r\nfor an armed invasion of that State to support the usurpations of Mr.\r\nDorr and his friends and foment domestic insurrection. It is very\r\nimportant that we should have accurate information on this subject, and\r\nI have to desire you to take all necessary means to acquire it, and\r\ncommunicate directly to me as speedily and frequently as possible. It is\r\nsaid that 1,000 stand of arms have been procured in Boston, some pieces\r\nof artillery, and a large quantity of camp equipage for the use of the\r\ninsurgents. Your attention to this is particularly desired to ascertain\r\nits truth or falsehood. It is also said that there are 200 men enrolled\r\nand embodied in a town upon the borders of Rhode Island, the name of\r\nwhich has escaped me. Please inquire into this. If it becomes necessary\r\nto employ confidential persons to discover what is doing, you will do\r\nso, being careful to select those only that are entirely trustworthy;\r\nand it will be desirable to avoid heated partisans on either side. Their\r\ninquiries should be conducted quietly and privately.\r\n\r\nI desire you to communicate fully and freely what you may learn and your\r\nviews concerning it for the information of the President and the\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to say that this communication is strictly\r\nprivate and confidential.\r\n\r\nRespectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n[J.C. SPENCER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, _June 3, 1842_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR: I came to this city yesterday, having taken a severe cold\r\non the Sound, and am now just out of my bed. I transmit herewith a\r\nletter from ----, a friend appointed by me, as you requested, to look\r\ninto the Rhode Island business. Mr. ---- has had access to authentic\r\nsources in Governor Dorr's party, and I have no doubt his account of the\r\nwhole matter is perfectly just. I supposed I should receive the foreign\r\nmail here, but I shall not wait for it if I should feel well enough to\r\ntravel to-morrow.\r\n\r\nYours, truly,\r\n\r\nDANL. WEBSTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, _June 3, 1842_.\r\n\r\nHon. DANIEL WEBSTER,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: In pursuance of the arrangement made when you were in Boston,\r\nI have visited the State of Rhode Island, and, so far as could be done,\r\npossessed myself of a knowledge of the existing state of things there.\r\nI had a full and free interview with Governor King and his council, as\r\nwell as with several other gentlemen upon each side of the matter in\r\ncontroversy. All agree that, so far as the people of Rhode Island are\r\nconcerned, there is no danger of any further armed resistance to the\r\nlegitimate authorities of the State. It was never intended, probably, by\r\nthe majority of those called the suffrage party to proceed in any event\r\nto violence, and when they found themselves pushed to such an extremity\r\nby their leaders they deserted their leaders and are now every day\r\nenrolling themselves in the volunteer companies which are being\r\norganized in every part of the State for the suppression of any further\r\ninsurrectionary movements that may be made. A large majority of those\r\nelected or appointed to office under the people's constitution (so\r\ncalled) have resigned their places and renounced all allegiance to that\r\nconstitution and the party which supports it, so that the insurgents are\r\nnow without any such organization as would enable them to carry out\r\ntheir original purposes if they otherwise had the power.\r\n\r\nGovernor King and his council alone, of all the intelligent persons with\r\nwhom I consulted, fear an irruption upon them of an armed force to be\r\ncollected in other States, and this is the only difficulty of which they\r\nnow have any apprehension. This fear is excited by the boasts frequently\r\nmade by the few who still avow their determination to adhere to the\r\nconstitution that they have at their control large bodies of armed men,\r\nas well as camp equipage, provisions, money, and munitions of war, which\r\nhave been provided for them in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New York.\r\nThe supposition that Rhode Island is to be invaded by a foreign force,\r\nwhen that force would neither be led nor followed by any considerable\r\nnumber of the people of the State, does not seem, to say the least,\r\nto be a very reasonable one. If those who think they are suffering\r\ninjustice are not disposed to make an effort to redress their supposed\r\nwrongs, they would hardly expect the work to be done by others.\r\n\r\nThe ostensible object of the insurgents now is not the real one. They\r\nmeditate no further forcible proceedings. They bluster and threaten for\r\nseveral reasons:\r\n\r\nFirst. Because they suppose they shall thus break their fall a little\r\nand render their retreat a little less inglorious than it would be if\r\nthey should beat it at once.\r\n\r\nSecond. They believe that if they keep up a shew of opposition to the\r\nexisting government they shall be more likely to revolutionize it by\r\npeaceable measures; and\r\n\r\nThird. They think they can make their influence so far felt as to\r\noperate favorably upon those who are now under arrest for treason or who\r\nmay be hereafter arrested for the same offense.\r\n\r\nThat these are the views and purposes of the insurgents I am\r\nconfidentially assured by the notorious individual from whom I told you\r\nI could learn their plans and designs; and no one has better means of\r\nknowing than he, having been himself one of Mr. Dorr's confidential\r\nadvisers from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe meeting at Woonsocket on the 1st did not amount to much, being but\r\nthinly attended. The projected fortifications at that place have been\r\nabandoned. It is said they will be thrown up in some other spot to be\r\ndesignated hereafter, but this is not believed.\r\n\r\nMr. Dorr is now understood to be lurking in this city. Warrants have\r\nbeen issued for his arrest both by the governor of this State and the\r\ngovernor of Massachusetts, but he moves so privately and shifts his\r\nwhereabouts so often that he eludes his pursuers.\r\n\r\nUnder all the circumstances I think you will come to the opinion\r\nentertained by seven-eighths of all the people of Providence (the scene\r\nof his operations thus far) that, deserted by his followers at home and\r\ndisgraced in the estimation of those who sympathized with him abroad;\r\nMr. Dorr has it not in his power to do any further serious mischief.\r\n\r\nYours, very truly,\r\n\r\n---- ----.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVIDENCE, R.I., _June 22, 1842_.\r\n\r\nHon. J.C. SPENCER,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\nSIR: When I last had the honor to write to you I felt confident that\r\nthere would be no further disturbance of the peace in this State.\r\nGovernor King was of the same opinion. But I now fear, from strong\r\nindications, that Mr. Dorr and his party are determined to enter the\r\nState in force, and that in a few days serious difficulties will arise.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival here this morning from Newport, on my way to New York,\r\nI learnt from undoubted authority that several large boxes of muskets,\r\nsupposed to contain about eighty, were received the evening before last\r\nat Woonsocket from New York; that several mounted cannon had been also\r\nreceived there and forwarded on to Chepachet; that a number of men, not\r\ncitizens of the State, with arms, were in and about Woonsocket and\r\nChepachet; that forty-eight kegs of powder were stolen on Sunday night\r\nlast from a powder house in this neighborhood, and that Dorr, with about\r\ntwenty men, landed last evening at Norwich.\r\n\r\nAn unsuccessful attempt was made two nights ago to steal the guns of the\r\nartillery company at Warren, and at several other places where guns had\r\nbeen deposited by the State, by some of Dorr's men, one of whom has been\r\nidentified and arrested.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed for several days past that many of the suffrage\r\nparty and residents of this city have been sending off their families\r\nand effects. The inhabitants of the city are seriously alarmed and in a\r\nstate of much excitement. An express to convey the above intelligence to\r\nGovernor King at Newport will be immediately sent down by the mayor of\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nI shall be in New York early to-morrow morning ready to receive any\r\ninstructions you may think proper to honor me with.\r\n\r\nI have been compelled to write this in haste.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJAS. BANKHEAD,\r\n  _Colonel Second Regiment Artillery_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY OF PROVIDENCE, MAYOR'S OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_June 23,1842_.\r\n\r\nSIR:[121] Governor King, having gone to Newport this afternoon, has\r\nrequested me to forward his letter to Your Excellency, with such\r\ndepositions as I could procure concerning the state of affairs in\r\nthe north part of the State. These documents will be taken on by the\r\nHon. William Sprague, our Senator, who intends leaving to-night for\r\nWashington. Should any accident prevent Mr. Sprague from going, I shall\r\nforward them to be put in the mail. I inclose the depositions[122] of\r\nMessrs. Samuel W. Peckham and Charles I. Harris. Messrs. Keep and\r\nShelley, whom I sent out, have just returned. If I can get their\r\ndepositions in time, I shall also forward them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: Addressed to the President of the United States.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: Omitted.]\r\n\r\nAbout 11 a.m. this day a body marched from Woonsocket to Chepachet\r\namounting to 90 men, and other small bodies are marching in that\r\ndirection, so that I suppose that about 400 will be concentrated at\r\nChepachet this evening.\r\n\r\nIn this city there is much excitement, but no symptoms as yet of men\r\ngathering with arms. There are many who I fear will be ready to join\r\nin any mischief should Dorr's forces approach us. Up to 8 o'clock this\r\nmorning Mr. Dorr was in Connecticut, but a gentleman from Chepachet\r\ninforms me his friends expect him this day.\r\n\r\nI remain, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nTHOS. M. BURGESS,\r\n  _Mayor_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Providence, June 23, 1842_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency JOHN TYLER,\r\n\r\n_President of the United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: After my last communication the excitement and military operations\r\nof the insurgents against the government of this State appeared to\r\nsubside, and I indulged hopes that no open violence would be attempted,\r\nbut that they were disposed to await the action of the general assembly,\r\nnow in session at Newport. I regret that I am obliged to inform Your\r\nExcellency that within a few days past appearances have become more\r\nalarming. Several iron cannon have been stolen from citizens of\r\nProvidence, and during the night of the 19th a powder house, owned by a\r\nmerchant of Providence, was broken open and about 1,200 pounds of powder\r\nstolen therefrom. Yesterday the military operations of the insurgents\r\nbecame more decided in their character. At Woonsocket and Chepachet\r\nthere were gatherings of men in military array, pretending to act under\r\nthe authority of Thomas W. Dorr. They established a kind of martial law\r\nin those villages, stopped peaceable citizens in the highways, and at\r\nChepachet four citizens of Providence were seized by an armed force,\r\npinioned, and compelled to march about 10 miles under a guard of about\r\nforty men to Woonsocket, where they were cruelly treated under pretense\r\nof being spies. The insurgents are provided with cannon, tents,\r\nammunition, and stores.\r\n\r\nIt is ascertained that Thomas W. Dorr has returned from the city of New\r\nYork to the State of Connecticut, and I have reason to believe he will\r\nbe at Chepachet this day, where he will concentrate what forces he has\r\nalready under arms with such others as he can collect. Those already\r\nassembled are composed of citizens of other States as well as of our\r\nown, and are variously estimated at 500 to 1,000 men.\r\n\r\nI have this morning had an interview with Colonel Bankhead, who will\r\ncommunicate to the War Department such facts as have come to his\r\nknowledge. I would further state to Your Excellency that in those\r\nvillages and their vicinity the civil authority is disregarded and\r\nparalyzed.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I respectfully submit to Your Excellency that\r\nthe crisis has arrived when the aid demanded by the legislature of the\r\nState from the Federal Government is imperatively required to furnish\r\nthat protection to our citizens from domestic violence which is\r\nguaranteed by the Constitution and laws of the United States.\r\n\r\nI confidently trust that Your Excellency will adopt such measures as\r\nwill afford us prompt and efficient relief.\r\n\r\nI remain, with great consideration, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nSAM. W. KING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 25, 1842_.\r\n\r\nGovernor KING.\r\n\r\nSIR: Your letter of the 23d instant was this day received by the hands\r\nof Governor Sprague, together with the documents accompanying the same.\r\nYour excellency has unintentionally overlooked the fact that the\r\nlegislature of Rhode Island is now in session. The act of Congress gives\r\nto the Executive of the United States no power to summon to the aid of\r\nthe State the military force of the United States unless an application\r\nshall be made by the legislature if in session; and that the State\r\nexecutive can not make such application except when the legislature can\r\nnot be convened. (See act of Congress, February 28, 1795.)\r\n\r\nI presume that your excellency has been led into the error of making\r\nthis application (the legislature of the State being in session at the\r\ndate of your dispatch) from a misapprehension of the true import of my\r\nletter of 7th May last. I lose no time in correcting such\r\nmisapprehension if it exist.\r\n\r\nShould the legislature of Rhode Island deem it proper to make a\r\nsimilar application to that addressed to me by your excellency, their\r\ncommunication shall receive all the attention which will be justly due\r\nto the high source from which such application shall emanate.\r\n\r\nI renew to your excellency assurances of high consideration.\r\n\r\nJ. TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVIDENCE, R.I., _June 23, 1842_.\r\n\r\nHon. JOHN C. SPENCER,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I addressed you yesterday afternoon in great haste, that my letter\r\nmight go by the mail (then about being closed), to inform you of the\r\nsudden change in the aspect of affairs in this State, and also to inform\r\nyou that I should be this morning at Governors Island, New York.\r\n\r\nAt the urgent solicitation of Governor King, who crossed over from\r\nNewport to Stonington to intercept me on the route, I returned last\r\nnight to this place from Stonington, having proceeded so far on my way\r\nto New York.\r\n\r\nIn addition to what I stated in my letter yesterday, I learn from\r\nGovernor King (who has just called on me) that four citizens of this\r\ncity who had gone to Chepachet to ascertain what was going on there were\r\narrested as spies by the insurgents, bound, and sent last night to\r\nWoonsocket, where they were confined when his informer left there at\r\n8 o'clock this morning; also that martial law had been proclaimed by the\r\ninsurgents at Woonsocket and Chepachet, and no one was allowed to enter\r\nor depart from either place without permission.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of this city are in a state of intense excitement.\r\n\r\nI shall return to-morrow to Newport to await any instructions you may be\r\npleased to favor me with.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, sir, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJAS. BANKHEAD,\r\n  _Colonel Second Regiment Artillery_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVIDENCE, R.I., _June 23, 1842_.\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General R. JONES,\r\n\r\n_Adjutant-General United States Army_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I left Newport yesterday morning to return to Fort Columbus, with\r\nthe belief that my presence could no longer be necessary for the purpose\r\nI had been ordered there for. The legislature was in session, and, as I\r\nwas well assured, determined honestly and faithfully to adopt measures\r\nto meet the wishes of the citizens of this State to form a constitution\r\non such liberal principles as to insure full satisfaction to all\r\npatriotic and intelligent men who had any interest in the welfare of\r\nthe State. The well-known intention of the legislature in this respect\r\nwould, I hoped and believed, reconcile the factious and produce\r\ntranquillity. But the aspect of affairs has suddenly become more\r\nthreatening and alarming. There is an assemblage of men at Woonsocket\r\nand Chepachet, two small villages (say 15 miles distant hence) on the\r\nborders of Connecticut, composed principally of strangers or persons\r\nfrom other States. They have recently received 75 muskets from Boston\r\nand 80 from New York, in addition to former supplies. They have also\r\nseveral mounted cannon and a large quantity of ammunition, 48 kegs of\r\nwhich they stole from a powder house not far distant from this, the\r\nproperty of a manufacturer of powder. Dorr, it is supposed, joined his\r\nparty at one of the above-named places the night before last; he has\r\ncertainly returned from New York and passed through Norwich. His\r\n_concentrated_ forces are variously estimated at from 500 to 1,000 men.\r\n\r\nI had proceeded thus far yesterday afternoon on my return to New York,\r\nand had taken my seat in the cars for Stonington, when an express from\r\nGovernor King, who was at Newport, overtook me, to request that I would\r\nnot leave the State; too late, however, for me then to stop here, as\r\nthe cars were just moving off. On getting to Stonington I there found\r\nGovernor King, who had crossed over from Newport to intercept me, and\r\nat his solicitation I at once returned with him last night in an extra\r\ncar to this place. Not then having a moment's time to write you, as the\r\nsteamboat left immediately on the arrival of the cars at Stonington,\r\nI sent my adjutant on in the boat with directions to report to you the\r\nfact and the cause of my return.\r\n\r\nI had written thus far when the governor called on me, and has informed\r\nme that four citizens of this State, who had gone to Chepachet to\r\nascertain the exact state of affairs there, were arrested as spies,\r\nbound, and sent last night to Woonsocket, where two hours ago they were\r\nstill in confinement. Martial law has been declared in Chepachet and\r\nWoonsocket, and no one allowed to enter or depart without permission.\r\nI yesterday afternoon wrote to the Secretary of War (as I had been\r\ndirected), in great haste, however, to send by the mail, to inform him\r\nof the sudden change in the aspect of affairs here; in which letter\r\nI stated that I should be at Governors Island this morning. As I, of\r\ncourse, then did not contemplate to the contrary, I beg you will do me\r\nthe favor to acquaint him with the cause of my return.\r\n\r\nI can only add that the citizens of this place are in a state of intense\r\nanxiety and excitement. I remain here to-day at the special request of\r\nseveral who have just left me. To-morrow I shall return to Newport to\r\nawait any communication from you.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJAS. BANKHEAD,\r\n  _Colonel Second Regiment Artillery_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVIDENCE, R.I., _June 27, 1842_.\r\n\r\nSIR:[123] As there was no mail yesterday from this, I could make no\r\nreport to the Major-General Commanding of the military movements in\r\nthis quarter up to that time. Since my last letter to you most of the\r\nvolunteers and other military companies called out by the governor\r\nhave assembled here to the amount of about 2,000 men. The force of the\r\ninsurgents under the immediate direction of Mr. Dorr, and concentrated\r\nat Chepachet, is estimated at from 800 to 1,000 men armed with muskets,\r\nabout 1,500 without arms, and 10 or 12 cannon mounted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: Addressed to Brigadier-General R. Jones, Adjutant-General\r\nUnited States Army.]\r\n\r\nIt seems to be impossible to avoid a conflict between the contending\r\nparties without the interposition of a strong regular force.\r\n\r\nThe State force here can defend this city, and it might successfully\r\nattack the insurgent force at Chepachet; but there would be danger in\r\nleaving the city without adequate means of protection to it, as there is\r\ndoubtless a large number within the city with concealed arms ready to\r\ncommence hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe position taken by Dorr's troops at Chepachet is naturally strong,\r\nand has been much strengthened by intrenchments, etc. It would therefore\r\nbe highly imprudent to make the attack, even if no secret foes were left\r\nbehind within the city, without a positive certainty of success; and\r\nwith the aid of a few disciplined troops a defeat there would be ruinous\r\nand irreparable.\r\n\r\nA force of 300 regular troops would insure success, and probably without\r\nbloodshed.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJAS. BANKHEAD,\r\n  _Colonel Second Regiment Artillery_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 27, 1842_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: The intelligence from Rhode Island since the call was made on you\r\nby the Senators from that State is of a character still more serious\r\nand urgent than that then communicated to you by Mr. Sprague, who was\r\ncharged with communications to Your Excellency from Governor King. We\r\nare informed that a requisition was made upon the Government of the\r\nUnited States by the governor of Rhode Island, pursuant to resolutions\r\npassed by the general assembly of that State when in session in May\r\nlast, calling for a proclamation against those engaged in an armed\r\nrebellion against the government of Rhode Island and for military aid in\r\nsuppressing the same; that Your Excellency replied to Governor King that\r\nin the opinion of the Executive the force arrayed against the government\r\nof the State was not then such as to warrant immediate action on his\r\npart, but that Your Excellency in your reply proceeded to say: \"If an\r\nexigency of lawless violence shall actually arise, the executive\r\ngovernment of the United States, on the application of your excellency\r\nunder the authority of the resolutions of the legislature already\r\nsubmitted, will stand ready to succor the authorities of the State in\r\ntheir efforts to maintain a due respect for the laws.\" Whereby it was\r\nunderstood that in the event of the assembling of such an armed force as\r\nwould require the interference contemplated by the Constitution and laws\r\nof the United States the Executive of the United States, upon being duly\r\nnotified of the fact by the governor of the State, would act upon the\r\nrequisition already made by the legislature without further action on\r\nthe part of that body.\r\n\r\nWe understand that upon this notice being given through the\r\ncommunications handed you by Mr. Sprague on Saturday, containing proof\r\nof the existence and array of a large body of armed men within the State\r\nof Rhode Island, who had already committed acts of lawless violence,\r\nboth by depredating largely upon property in various parts of the\r\nState and by capturing and confining citizens, as well as owning and\r\nmanifesting a determination to attack the constituted authorities, you\r\nconsidered that it was desirable that this communication should have\r\nbeen accompanied with a further resolution of the general assembly\r\nauthorizing the governor to act in this instance, from the fact that\r\nthe assembly was then in session by adjournment.\r\n\r\nIt is the purpose of this communication respectfully to state that we\r\nconceive the existing circumstances call for the immediate action of the\r\nExecutive upon the information and papers now in its possession.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the legislature during the last week was by adjournment.\r\nIt is in law regarded as the May session of the general assembly, and\r\ncan be regarded in no other light than if it had been a continuous\r\nsession of that body held from day to day by usual adjournments. Had\r\nthis last been the case, it can not be conceived that new action on its\r\npart would have been required to give notice of any movements of hostile\r\nforces engaged in the same enterprise which was made known to the\r\nExecutive by its resolutions of May last.\r\n\r\nOur intelligence authorizes us to believe that a multitude of\r\nlawless and violent men, not citizens of Rhode Island, but inhabitants\r\nof other States, wickedly induced by pay and by hopes of spoil, and\r\nperhaps instigated also by motives arising from exasperation on the\r\npart of their instigators and of themselves at the course heretofore\r\nindicated in this matter by the executive government of the Union, have\r\ncongregated themselves and are daily increasing their numbers within the\r\nborders of our State, organized, armed, and arrayed in open war upon the\r\nState authorities, and ready to be led, and avowedly about to be led,\r\nto the attack of the principal city of the State as part of the same\r\noriginal plan to overthrow the government, and that in the prosecution\r\nof this plan our citizens have reason to apprehend the most desperate\r\nand reckless assaults of ruffianly violence upon their property, their\r\nhabitations, and their lives.\r\n\r\nWe beg leave to refer you, in addition, to a letter which we understand\r\nwas received yesterday by General Scott from Colonel Bankhead, detailing\r\nsome information in his possession.\r\n\r\nWe therefore respectfully request an immediate compliance on the part\r\nof the Executive with the requisition communicated in the papers from\r\nGovernor King, as the most effectual, and, in our opinion, the only\r\nmeasure that can now prevent the effusion of blood and the calamities\r\nof intestine violence, if each has not already occurred.\r\n\r\nWe are, with the highest respect, Your Excellency's obedient servants,\r\n\r\nJAMES F. SIMMONS.\r\n  WM. SPRAGUE.\r\n    JOSEPH L. TILLINGHAST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 29,1842_.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary Of War.\r\n\r\nSIR: From the official communication of Colonel Bankhead to you, this\r\nday laid before me, it is evident that the difficulties in Rhode Island\r\nhave arrived at a crisis which may require a prompt interposition of\r\nthe Executive of the United States to prevent the effusion of blood.\r\nFrom the correspondence already had with the governor of Rhode Island\r\nI have reason to expect that a requisition will be immediately made\r\nby the government of that State for the assistance guaranteed by the\r\nConstitution to protect its citizens from domestic violence. With a view\r\nto ascertain the true condition of things and to render the assistance\r\nof this Government (if any shall be required) as prompt as may be, you\r\nare instructed to proceed to Rhode Island, and, in the event of a\r\nrequisition being made upon the President in conformity with the laws of\r\nthe United States, you will cause the proclamation herewith delivered\r\nto be published. And should circumstances in your opinion render it\r\nnecessary, you will also call upon the governors of Massachusetts and\r\nConnecticut, or either of them, for such number and description of the\r\nmilitia of their respective States as may be sufficient to terminate at\r\nonce the insurrection in Rhode Island. And in the meantime the troops\r\nin the vicinity of Providence may with propriety be placed in such\r\npositions as will enable them to defend that city from assault.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas the legislature of the State of Rhode Island has applied to\r\nthe President of the United States setting forth the existence of\r\na dangerous insurrection in that State, composed partly of deluded\r\ncitizens of the State, but chiefly of intruders of dangerous and\r\nabandoned character coming from other States, and requiring the\r\nimmediate interposition of the constitutional power vested in him to be\r\nexercised in such cases, I do issue this my proclamation, according to\r\nlaw, hereby commanding all insurgents and all persons connected with\r\nsaid insurrection to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective\r\nabodes within twenty-four hours from the time when this proclamation\r\nshall be made public in Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be\r\nhereunto affixed, and signed the same with my hand.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington this ---- day of ---- A.D. 1842, and of\r\nthe Independence of the United States the sixty-sixth.\r\n\r\n[L.S.] JOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  DANL. WEBSTER,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 22, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for your approval and ratification, a treaty which\r\nI have caused to be negotiated between the United States and Texas,\r\nwhereby the latter, on the conditions therein set forth, has transferred\r\nand conveyed all its right of separate and independent sovereignty and\r\njurisdiction to the United States. In taking so important a step I have\r\nbeen influenced by what appeared to me to be the most controlling\r\nconsiderations of public policy and the general good, and in having\r\naccomplished it, should it meet with your approval, the Government will\r\nhave succeeded in reclaiming a territory which formerly constituted a\r\nportion, as it is confidently believed, of its domain under the treaty\r\nof cession of 1803 by France to the United States.\r\n\r\nThe country thus proposed to be annexed has been settled principally\r\nby persons from the United States, who emigrated on the invitation\r\nof both Spain and Mexico, and who carried with them into the wilderness\r\nwhich they have partially reclaimed the laws, customs, and political\r\nand domestic institutions of their native land. They are deeply\r\nindoctrinated in all the principles of civil liberty, and will bring\r\nalong with them in the act of reassociation devotion to our Union and\r\na firm and inflexible resolution to assist in maintaining the public\r\nliberty unimpaired--a consideration which, as it appears to me, is to be\r\nregarded as of no small moment. The country itself thus obtained is of\r\nincalculable value in an agricultural and commercial point of view. To a\r\nsoil of inexhaustible fertility it unites a genial and healthy climate,\r\nand is destined at a day not distant to make large contributions to the\r\ncommerce of the world. Its territory is separated from the United States\r\nin part by an imaginary line, and by the river Sabine for a distance\r\nof 310 miles, and its productions are the same with those of many of\r\nthe contiguous States of the Union. Such is the country, such are its\r\ninhabitants, and such its capacities to add to the general wealth of the\r\nUnion. As to the latter, it may be safely asserted that in the magnitude\r\nof its productions it will equal in a short time, under the protecting\r\ncare of this Government, if it does not surpass, the combined production\r\nof many of the States of the Confederacy. A new and powerful impulse\r\nwill thus be given to the navigating interest of the country, which will\r\nbe chiefly engrossed by our fellow-citizens of the Eastern and Middle\r\nStates, who have already attained a remarkable degree of prosperity by\r\nthe partial monopoly they have enjoyed of the carrying trade of the\r\nUnion, particularly the coastwise trade, which this new acquisition is\r\ndestined in time, and that not distant, to swell to a magnitude which\r\ncan not easily be computed, while the addition made to the boundaries\r\nof the home market thus secured to their mining, manufacturing, and\r\nmechanical skill and industry will be of a character the most commanding\r\nand important. Such are some of the many advantages which will\r\naccrue to the Eastern and Middle States by the ratification of the\r\ntreaty--advantages the extent of which it is impossible to estimate with\r\naccuracy or properly to appreciate. Texas, being adapted to the culture\r\nof cotton, sugar, and rice, and devoting most of her energies to the\r\nraising of these productions, will open an extensive market to the\r\nWestern States in the important articles of beef, pork, horses, mules,\r\netc., as well as in breadstuffs. At the same time, the Southern and\r\nSoutheastern States will find in the fact of annexation protection and\r\nsecurity to their peace and tranquillity, as well against all domestic\r\nas foreign efforts to disturb them, thus consecrating anew the union of\r\nthe States and holding out the promise of its perpetual duration. Thus,\r\nat the same time that the tide of public prosperity is greatly swollen,\r\nan appeal of what appears to the Executive to be of an imposing, if not\r\nof a resistless, character is made to the interests of every portion of\r\nthe country. Agriculture, which would have a new and extensive market\r\nopened for its produce; commerce, whose ships would be freighted with\r\nthe rich productions of an extensive and fertile region; and the\r\nmechanical arts, in all their various ramifications, would seem to\r\nunite in one universal demand for the ratification of the treaty. But\r\nimportant as these considerations may appear, they are to be regarded\r\nas but secondary to others. Texas, for reasons deemed sufficient by\r\nherself, threw off her dependence on Mexico as far back as 1836, and\r\nconsummated her independence by the battle of San Jacinto in the same\r\nyear, since which period Mexico has attempted no serious invasion of her\r\nterritory, but the contest has assumed features of a mere border war,\r\ncharacterized by acts revolting to humanity. In the year 1836 Texas\r\nadopted her constitution, under which she has existed as a sovereign\r\npower ever since, having been recognized as such by many of the\r\nprincipal powers of the world; and contemporaneously with its adoption,\r\nby a solemn vote of her people, embracing all her population but\r\nninety-three persons, declared her anxious desire to be admitted into\r\nassociation with the United States as a portion of their territory.\r\nThis vote, thus solemnly taken, has never been reversed, and now by the\r\naction of her constituted authorities, sustained as it is by popular\r\nsentiment, she reaffirms her desire for annexation. This course has been\r\nadopted by her without the employment of any sinister measures on the\r\npart of this Government. No intrigue has been set on foot to accomplish\r\nit. Texas herself wills it, and the Executive of the United States,\r\nconcurring with her, has seen no sufficient reason to avoid the\r\nconsummation of an act esteemed to be so desirable by both. It can\r\nnot be denied that Texas is greatly depressed in her energies by her\r\nlong-protracted war with Mexico. Under these circumstances it is but\r\nnatural that she should seek for safety and repose under the protection\r\nof some stronger power, and it is equally so that her people should turn\r\nto the United States, the land of their birth, in the first instance in\r\nthe pursuit of such protection. She has often before made known her\r\nwishes, but her advances have to this time been repelled. The Executive\r\nof the United States sees no longer any cause for pursuing such a\r\ncourse. The hazard of now defeating her wishes may be of the most fatal\r\ntendency. It might lead, and most probably would, to such an entire\r\nalienation of sentiment and feeling as would inevitably induce her to\r\nlook elsewhere for aid, and force her either to enter into dangerous\r\nalliances with other nations, who, looking with more wisdom to their\r\nown interests, would, it is fairly to be presumed, readily adopt such\r\nexpedients; or she would hold out the proffer of discriminating duties\r\nin trade and commerce in order to secure the necessary assistance.\r\nWhatever step she might adopt looking to this object would prove\r\ndisastrous in the highest degree to the interests of the whole Union.\r\nTo say nothing of the impolicy of our permitting the carrying trade\r\nand home market of such a country to pass out of our hands into those\r\nof a commercial rival, the Government, in the first place, would be\r\ncertain to suffer most disastrously in its revenue by the introduction\r\nof a system of smuggling upon an extensive scale, which an army of\r\ncustom-house officers could not prevent, and which would operate to\r\naffect injuriously the interests of all the industrial classes of this\r\ncountry. Hence would arise constant collisions between the inhabitants\r\nof the two countries, which would evermore endanger their peace. A large\r\nincrease of the military force of the United States would inevitably\r\nfollow, thus devolving upon the people new and extraordinary burdens in\r\norder not only to protect them from the danger of daily collision with\r\nTexas herself, but to guard their border inhabitants against hostile\r\ninroads, so easily excited on the part of the numerous and warlike\r\ntribes of Indians dwelling in their neighborhood. Texas would\r\nundoubtedly be unable for many years to come, if at any time, to resist\r\nunaided and alone the military power of the United States; but it is not\r\nextravagant to suppose that nations reaping a rich harvest from her\r\ntrade, secured to them by advantageous treaties, would be induced to\r\ntake part with her in any conflict with us, from the strongest\r\nconsiderations of public policy. Such a state of things might subject\r\nto devastation the territory of contiguous States, and would cost the\r\ncountry in a single campaign more treasure, thrice told over, than is\r\nstipulated to be paid and reimbursed by the treaty now proposed for\r\nratification. I will not permit myself to dwell on this view of the\r\nsubject. Consequences of a fatal character to the peace of the Union,\r\nand even to the preservation of the Union itself, might be dwelt upon.\r\nThey will not, however, fail to occur to the mind of the Senate and of\r\nthe country. Nor do I indulge in any vague conjectures of the future.\r\nThe documents now transmitted along with the treaty lead to the\r\nconclusion, as inevitable, that if the boon now tendered be rejected\r\nTexas will seek for the friendship of others. In contemplating such a\r\ncontingency it can not be overlooked that the United States are already\r\nalmost surrounded by the possessions of European powers. The Canadas,\r\nNew Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, the islands in the American seas, with\r\nTexas trammeled by treaties of alliance or of a commercial character\r\ndiffering in policy from that of the United States, would complete the\r\ncircle. Texas voluntarily steps forth, upon terms of perfect honor and\r\ngood faith to all nations, to ask to be annexed to the Union. As an\r\nindependent sovereignty her right to do this is unquestionable. In\r\ndoing so she gives no cause of umbrage to any other power; her people\r\ndesire it, and there is no slavish transfer of her sovereignty and\r\nindependence. She has for eight years maintained her independence\r\nagainst all efforts to subdue her. She has been recognized as\r\nindependent by many of the most prominent of the family of nations,\r\nand that recognition, so far as they are concerned, places her in\r\na position, without giving any just cause of umbrage to them, to\r\nsurrender her sovereignty at her own will and pleasure. The United\r\nStates, actuated evermore by a spirit of justice, has desired by the\r\nstipulations of the treaty to render justice to all. They have made\r\nprovision for the payment of the public debt of Texas. We look to her\r\nample and fertile domain as the certain means of accomplishing this; but\r\nthis is a matter between the United States and Texas, and with which\r\nother Governments have nothing to do. Our right to receive the rich\r\ngrant tendered by Texas is perfect, and this Government should not,\r\nhaving due respect either to its own honor or its own interests, permit\r\nits course of policy to be interrupted by the interference of other\r\npowers, even if such interference were threatened. The question is one\r\npurely American. In the acquisition, while we abstain most carefully\r\nfrom all that could interrupt the public peace, we claim the right to\r\nexercise a due regard to our own. This Government can not consistently\r\nwith its honor permit any such interference. With equal, if not greater,\r\npropriety might the United States demand of other governments to\r\nsurrender their numerous and valuable acquisitions made in past time at\r\nnumberless places on the surface of the globe, whereby they have added\r\nto their power and enlarged their resources.\r\n\r\nTo Mexico the Executive is disposed to pursue a course conciliatory in\r\nits character and at the same time to render her the most ample justice\r\nby conventions and stipulations not inconsistent with the rights and\r\ndignity of the Government. It is actuated by no spirit of unjust\r\naggrandizement, but looks only to its own security. It has made known to\r\nMexico at several periods its extreme anxiety to witness the termination\r\nof hostilities between that country and Texas. Its wishes, however, have\r\nbeen entirely disregarded. It has ever been ready to urge an adjustment\r\nof the dispute upon terms mutually advantageous to both. It will be\r\nready at all times to hear and discuss any claims Mexico may think she\r\nhas on the justice of the United States and to adjust any that may be\r\ndeemed to be so on the most liberal terms. There is no desire on the\r\npart of the Executive to wound her pride or affect injuriously her\r\ninterest, but at the same time it can not compromit by any delay in its\r\naction the essential interests of the United States. Mexico has no right\r\nto ask or expect this of us; we deal rightfully with Texas as an\r\nindependent power. The war which has been waged for eight years has\r\nresulted only in the conviction with all others than herself that Texas\r\ncan not be reconquered. I can not but repeat the opinion expressed in my\r\nmessage at the opening of Congress that it is time it had ceased. The\r\nExecutive, while it could not look upon its longer continuance without\r\nthe greatest uneasiness, has, nevertheless, for all past time preserved\r\na course of strict neutrality. It could not be ignorant of the fact of\r\nthe exhaustion which a war of so long a duration had produced. Least of\r\nall was it ignorant of the anxiety of other powers to induce Mexico to\r\nenter into terms of reconciliation with Texas, which, affecting the\r\ndomestic institutions of Texas, would operate most injuriously upon the\r\nUnited States and might most seriously threaten the existence of this\r\nhappy Union. Nor could it be unacquainted with the fact that although\r\nforeign governments might disavow all design to disturb the relations\r\nwhich exist under the Constitution between these States, yet that one,\r\nthe most powerful amongst them, had not failed to declare its marked\r\nand decided hostility to the chief feature in those relations and its\r\npurpose on all suitable occasions to urge upon Mexico the adoption of\r\nsuch a course in negotiating with Texas as to produce the obliteration\r\nof that feature from her domestic policy as one of the conditions of her\r\nrecognition by Mexico as an independent state. The Executive was also\r\naware of the fact that formidable associations of persons, the subjects\r\nof foreign powers, existed, who were directing their utmost efforts\r\nto the accomplishment of this object. To these conclusions it was\r\ninevitably brought by the documents now submitted to the Senate.\r\nI repeat, the Executive saw Texas in a state of almost hopeless\r\nexhaustion, and the question was narrowed down to the simple proposition\r\nwhether the United States should accept the boon of annexation upon fair\r\nand even liberal terms, or, by refusing to do so, force Texas to seek\r\nrefuge in the arms of some other power, either through a treaty of\r\nalliance, offensive and defensive, or the adoption of some other\r\nexpedient which might virtually make her tributary to such power and\r\ndependent upon it for all future time. The Executive has full reason to\r\nbelieve that such would have been the result without its interposition,\r\nand that such will be the result in the event either of unnecessary\r\ndelay in the ratification or of the rejection of the proposed treaty.\r\n\r\nIn full view, then, of the highest public duty, and as a measure of\r\nsecurity against evils incalculably great, the Executive has entered\r\ninto the negotiation, the fruits of which are now submitted to the\r\nSenate. Independent of the urgent reasons which existed for the step\r\nit has taken, it might safely invoke the fact (which it confidently\r\nbelieves) that there exists no civilized government on earth having a\r\nvoluntary tender made it of a domain so rich and fertile, so replete\r\nwith all that can add to national greatness and wealth, and so necessary\r\nto its peace and safety that would reject the offer. Nor are other\r\npowers, Mexico inclusive, likely in any degree to be injuriously\r\naffected by the ratification of the treaty. The prosperity of Texas\r\nwill be equally interesting to all; in the increase of the general\r\ncommerce of the world that prosperity will be secured by annexation.\r\n\r\nBut one view of the subject remains to be presented. It grows out of the\r\nproposed enlargement of our territory. From this, I am free to confess,\r\nI see no danger. The federative system is susceptible of the greatest\r\nextension compatible with the ability of the representation of the most\r\ndistant State or Territory to reach the seat of Government in time to\r\nparticipate in the functions of legislation and to make known the wants\r\nof the constituent body. Our confederated Republic consisted originally\r\nof thirteen members. It now consists of twice that number, while\r\napplications are before Congress to permit other additions. This\r\naddition of new States has served to strengthen rather than to weaken\r\nthe Union. New interests have sprung up, which require the united power\r\nof all, through the action of the common Government, to protect and\r\ndefend upon the high seas and in foreign parts. Each State commits with\r\nperfect security to that common Government those great interests growing\r\nout of our relations with other nations of the world, and which equally\r\ninvolve the good of all the States. Its domestic concerns are left to\r\nits own exclusive management. But if there were any force in the\r\nobjection it would seem to require an immediate abandonment of\r\nterritorial possessions which lie in the distance and stretch to a\r\nfar-off sea, and yet no one would be found, it is believed, ready to\r\nrecommend such an abandonment. Texas lies at our very doors and in our\r\nimmediate vicinity.\r\n\r\nUnder every view which I have been able to take of the subject, I think\r\nthat the interests of our common constituents, the people of all the\r\nStates, and a love of the Union left the Executive no other alternative\r\nthan to negotiate the treaty. The high and solemn duty of ratifying or\r\nrejecting it is wisely devolved on the Senate by the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 22, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith an additional article to the treaty of extradition\r\nlately concluded between the Governments of France and the United\r\nStates, for your approval and ratification. The reason upon which it is\r\nfounded is explained on the face of the article and in the letter from\r\nMr. Pageot which accompanies this communication.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 26, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 22d instant,\r\nrequesting the President to communicate to that body any communication,\r\npapers, or maps in possession of this Government specifying the\r\nsouthern, southwestern, and western boundaries of Texas, I transmit\r\na map of Texas and the countries adjacent, compiled in the Bureau of\r\nTopographical Engineers, under the direction of Colonel J.J. Abert,\r\nby Lieutenant U.E. Emory, of that Corps, and also a memoir upon the\r\nsubject by the same officer.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn my annual message at the commencement of the present session of\r\nCongress I informed the two Houses that instructions had been given\r\nby the Executive to the United States envoy at Berlin to negotiate\r\na commercial treaty with the States composing the Germanic Customs\r\nUnion for a reduction of the duties on tobacco and other agricultural\r\nproductions of the United States, in exchange for concessions on our\r\npart in relation to certain articles of export the product of the skill\r\nand industry of those countries. I now transmit a treaty which proposes\r\nto carry into effect the views and intentions thus previously expressed\r\nand declared, accompanied by two dispatches from Mr. Wheaton, our\r\nminister at Berlin. This is believed to be the first instance in which\r\nthe attempt has proved successful to obtain a reduction of the heavy and\r\nonerous duties to which American tobacco is subject in foreign markets,\r\nand, taken in connection with the greatly reduced duties on rice and\r\nlard and the free introduction of raw cotton, for which the treaty\r\nprovides, I can not but anticipate from its ratification important\r\nbenefits to the great agricultural, commercial, and navigating interests\r\nof the United States. The concessions on our part relate to articles\r\nwhich are believed not to enter injuriously into competition with the\r\nmanufacturing interest of the United States, while a country of great\r\nextent and embracing a population of 28,000,000 human beings will more\r\nthoroughly than heretofore be thrown open to the commercial enterprise\r\nof our fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the provisions of the treaty come to some extent in conflict\r\nwith existing laws, it is my intention, should it receive your approval\r\nand ratification, to communicate a copy of it to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, in order that that House may take such action upon it\r\nas it may deem necessary to give efficiency to its provisions.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 29,

to\r\nratification, a postal convention between the United States and the\r\nRepublic of New Granada, signed in the city of Bogota on the 6th of\r\nMarch last.\r\n\r\nIn order that the Senate may

the Department of State and the chairman of the\r\nCommittee on Commerce in the Senate, and between the same Department and\r\nMr. Blackford, the chargé d'affaires of the United States at Bogota, who\r\nconcluded the convention on the part of this Government.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 10, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI deem it proper to

TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 10, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress a letter from the Imaum of Muscat and a\r\ntranslation of it, together with sundry other papers, by which it will\r\nbe perceived that His Highness has been pleased again to offer to the\r\nUnited States a present of Arabian horses. These animals will be in\r\nWashington in a short time, and will be disposed of in such manner as\r\nCongress may think proper to direct.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 11, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith communicate to the Senate, for its consideration, two\r\nconventions concluded by the minister of the United States at\r\nBerlin--the one with the Kingdom of Wurtemberg, dated on the 10th day of\r\nApril, and the other with the Grand Duchy of Hesse, dated on the 26th\r\nday of March, 1844--for the mutual abolition of the _droit d'aubaine_\r\nand the _droit de detraction_ between those Governments and the United\r\nStates, and I communicate with the conventions copies of the\r\ncorrespondence necessary to explain the reasons for concluding them.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 15, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 13th instant,\r\nrequesting to be informed \"whether, since the commencement of the\r\nnegotiations which resulted in the treaty now before the Senate for the\r\nannexation of Texas to the United States, any military preparation has\r\nbeen made or ordered by the President for or in anticipation of war,\r\nand, if so, for what cause, and with whom was such war apprehended,\r\nand what are the preparations that have been made or ordered; has any\r\nmovement or assemblage or disposition of any of the military or naval\r\nforces of the United States been made or ordered with a view to such\r\nhostilities; and to communicate to the Senate copies of all orders or\r\ndirections given for any such preparation or for any such movement or\r\ndisposition or for the future conduct of such military or naval forces,\"\r\nI have to inform the Senate that, in consequence of the declaration of\r\nMexico communicated to this Government and by me laid before Congress\r\nat the opening of its present session, announcing the determination\r\nof Mexico to regard as a declaration of war against her by the United\r\nStates the definitive ratification of any treaty with Texas annexing the\r\nterritory of that Republic to the United States, and the hope and belief\r\nentertained by the Executive that the treaty with Texas for that purpose\r\nwould be speedily approved and ratified by the Senate, it was regarded\r\nby the Executive to have become emphatically its duty to concentrate\r\nin the Gulf of Mexico and its vicinity, as a precautionary measure,\r\nas large a portion of the home squadron, under the command of Captain\r\nConner, as could well be drawn together, and at the same time to\r\nassemble at Fort Jesup, on the borders of Texas, as large a military\r\nforce as the demands of the service at other encampments would authorize\r\nto be detached. For the number of ships already in the Gulf and the\r\nwaters contiguous thereto and such as are placed under orders for that\r\ndestination, and of troops now assembled upon the frontier, I refer you\r\nto the accompanying reports from the Secretaries of the War and Navy\r\nDepartments. It will also be perceived by the Senate, by referring to\r\nthe orders of the Navy Department which are herewith transmitted, that\r\nthe naval officer in command of the fleet is directed to cause his ships\r\nto perform all the duties of a fleet of observation and to apprise the\r\nExecutive of any indication of a hostile design upon Texas on the part\r\nof any nation pending the deliberations of the Senate upon the treaty,\r\nwith a view that the same should promptly be submitted to Congress for\r\nits mature deliberation. At the same time, it is due to myself that\r\nI should declare it as my opinion that the United States having by the\r\ntreaty of annexation acquired a title to Texas which requires only the\r\naction of the Senate to perfect it, no other power could be permitted\r\nto invade and by force of arms to possess itself of any portion of the\r\nterritory of Texas pending your deliberations upon the treaty without\r\nplacing itself in an hostile attitude to the United States and\r\njustifying the employment of any military means at our disposal to drive\r\nback the invasion. At the same time, it is my opinion that Mexico of\r\nany other power will find in your approval of the treaty no just cause\r\nof war against the United States, nor do I believe that there is any\r\nserious hazard of war to be found in the fact of such approval.\r\nNevertheless, every proper measure will be resorted to by the Executive\r\nto preserve upon an honorable and just basis the public peace by\r\nreconciling Mexico, through a liberal course of policy, to the treaty.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 15, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 13th instant,\r\nrequesting to be informed \"whether a messenger has been sent to Mexico\r\nwith a view to obtain her consent to the treaty with Texas, and, if so,\r\nto communicate to the Senate a copy of the dispatches of which he is\r\nbearer and a copy of the instructions given to said messenger; and also\r\nto inform the Senate within what time said messenger is expected to\r\nreturn,\" I have to say that no messenger has been sent to Mexico in\r\norder to obtain her assent to the treaty with Texas, it not being\r\nregarded by the Executive as in any degree requisite to obtain such\r\nconsent in order (should the Senate ratify the treaty) to perfect the\r\ntitle of the United States to the territory thus acquired, the title to\r\nthe same being full and perfect without the assent of any third power.\r\nThe Executive has negotiated with Texas as an independent power of the\r\nworld, long since recognized as such by the United States and other\r\npowers, and as subordinate in all her rights of full sovereignty to no\r\nother power. A messenger has been dispatched to our minister at Mexico\r\nas bearer of the dispatch already communicated to the Senate, and which\r\nis to be found in the letter addressed to Mr. Green, and forms a part of\r\nthe documents ordered confidentially to be printed for the use of the\r\nSenate. That dispatch was dictated by a desire to preserve the peace\r\nof the two countries by denying to Mexico all pretext for assuming a\r\nbelligerent attitude to the United States, as she had threatened to do,\r\nin the event of the annexation of Texas to the United States, by the\r\ndispatch of her Government which was communicated by me to Congress at\r\nthe opening of its present session. The messenger is expected to return\r\nbefore the 15th of June next, but he may be detained to a later day. The\r\nrecently appointed envoy from the United States to Mexico will be sent\r\nso soon as the final action is had on the question of annexation, at\r\nwhich time, and not before, can his instructions be understandingly\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 16, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn my message communicating the treaty with Texas I expressed the\r\nopinion that if Texas was not now annexed it was probable that the\r\nopportunity of annexing it to the United States would be lost forever.\r\nSince then the subject has been much agitated, and if an opinion may\r\nbe formed of the chief ground of the opposition to the treaty, it is\r\nnot that Texas ought not at some time or other to be annexed, but that\r\nthe present is not the proper time. It becomes, therefore, important,\r\nin this view of the subject, and is alike due to the Senate and the\r\ncountry, that I should furnish any papers in my possession which may be\r\ncalculated to impress the Senate with the correctness of the opinion\r\nthus expressed by me. With this view I herewith transmit a report from\r\nthe Secretary of State, accompanied by various communications on the\r\nsubject. These communications are from private sources, and it is to be\r\nremarked that a resort must in all such cases be had chiefly to private\r\nsources of information, since it is not to be expected that any\r\ngovernment, more especially if situated as Texas is, would be inclined\r\nto develop to the world its ulterior line of policy.\r\n\r\nAmong the extracts is one from a letter from General Houston to General\r\nAndrew Jackson, to which I particularly invite your attention, and\r\nanother from General Jackson to a gentleman of high respectability,\r\nnow of this place. Considering that General Jackson was placed in a\r\nsituation to hold the freest and fullest interview with Mr. Miller, the\r\nprivate and confidential secretary of President Houston, who, President\r\nHouston informed General Jackson, \"knows all his actions and understands\r\nall his motives,\" and who was authorized to communicate to General\r\nJackson the views of the policy entertained by the President of Texas,\r\nas well applicable to the present as the future; that the declaration\r\nmade by General Jackson in his letter \"that the present golden moment to\r\nobtain Texas must not be lost, or Texas might from necessity be thrown\r\ninto the arms of England and be forever lost to the United States,\"\r\nwas made with a full knowledge of all circumstances, and ought to be\r\nreceived as conclusive of what will be the course of Texas should the\r\npresent treaty fail--from this high source, sustained, if it requires\r\nto be sustained, by the accompanying communications, I entertain not\r\nthe least doubt that if annexation should now fail it will in all human\r\nprobability fail forever. Indeed, I have strong reasons to believe that\r\ninstructions have already been given by the Texan Government to propose\r\nto the Government of Great Britain, forthwith on the failure, to enter\r\ninto a treaty of commerce and an alliance offensive and defensive.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 17, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 13th instant, relating\r\nto a supposed armistice between the Republics of Mexico and Texas,\r\nI transmit a report from the Secretary of State and the papers by which\r\nit was accompanied.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 18, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 29th ultimo, upon the\r\nsubject of unpublished correspondence in regard to the purchase of or\r\ntitle to Texas, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State and the\r\ndocuments by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 18, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 3d of\r\nJanuary last, requesting the President of the United States \"to cause to\r\nbe communicated to that House copies of all the instructions given to\r\nthe commanding officers of the squadron stipulated by the treaty with\r\nGreat Britain of 9th of August, 1842, to be kept on the coast of Africa\r\nfor the suppression of the slave trade,\" and also copies of the\r\n\"instructions given by the British Government to their squadron\r\nstipulated by the same, if such instructions have been communicated to\r\nthis Government,\" I have to inform the House of Representatives that\r\nin my opinion it would be incompatible with the public interests to\r\ncommunicate to that body at this time copies of the instructions\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 20, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n22d ultimo, I communicate a report[127] from the Secretary of State,\r\nwhich embraces the information called for by said resolution.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: Relating to indemnity from Denmark for three ships and\r\ntheir cargoes sent by Commodore John Paul Jones in 1779 as prizes into\r\nBergen, and there surrendered by order of the Danish King to the British\r\nminister, in obedience to the demand of that minister.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 20. 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit a letter from the Secretary of the Navy,\r\naccompanied by a report from the Bureau of Construction and Equipment\r\nand a communication from Lieutenant Hunter, of the Navy, prepared\r\nat the request of the Secretary, upon the subject of a plan for the\r\nestablishment in connection with the Government of France of a line of\r\nsteamers between the ports of Havre and New York, with estimates of the\r\nexpense which may be necessary to carry the said plan into effect.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 23, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nYour resolution of the 18th instant, adopted in _executive_ session,\r\naddressed to the Secretary of the Treasury _ad interim_, has been\r\ncommunicated to me by that officer.

The papers communicated embrace not only the series already\r\nmade public by orders of the Senate, but others from which the veil\r\nof secrecy has not been removed by that body, but which I deem to be\r\nessential to a just appreciation of the entire question. While the\r\ntreaty was pending before the Senate I did not consider it compatible\r\nwith the just rights of that body or consistent with the respect\r\nentertained for it to bring this important subject before you. The\r\npower of Congress is, however, fully competent in some other form of\r\nproceeding to accomplish everything that a formal ratification of the\r\ntreaty could have accomplished, and I therefore feel that I should but\r\nimperfectly discharge my duty to yourselves or the country if I failed\r\nto lay before you everything in the possession of the Executive which\r\nwould enable you to act with full light on the subject if you should\r\ndeem it proper to take any action upon it.\r\n\r\nI regard the question involved in these proceedings as one of vast\r\nmagnitude and as addressing itself to interests of an elevated and\r\nenduring character. A Republic coterminous in territory with our own, of\r\nimmense resources, which require only to be brought under the influence\r\nof our confederate and free system in order to be fully developed,\r\npromising at no distant day, through the fertility of its soil, nearly,\r\nif not entirely, to duplicate the exports of the country, thereby making\r\nan addition to the carrying trade to an amount almost incalculable\r\nand giving a new impulse of immense importance to the commercial,\r\nmanufacturing, agricultural, and shipping interests of the Union, and at\r\nthe same time affording protection to an exposed frontier and placing\r\nthe whole country in a condition of security and repose; a territory\r\nsettled mostly by emigrants from the United States, who would bring back\r\nwith them in the act of reassociation an unconquerable love of freedom\r\nand an ardent attachment to our free institutions--such a question could\r\nnot fail to interest most deeply in its success those who under the\r\nConstitution have become responsible for the faithful administration of\r\npublic affairs. I have regarded it as not a little fortunate that the\r\nquestion involved was no way sectional or local, but addressed itself to\r\nthe interests of every part of the country and made its appeal to the\r\nglory of the American name.\r\n\r\nIt is due to the occasion to say that I have carefully reconsidered the\r\nobjections which have been urged to immediate action upon the subject\r\nwithout in any degree having been struck by their force. It has been\r\nobjected that the measure of annexation should be preceded by the\r\nconsent of Mexico. To preserve the most friendly relations with Mexico;\r\nto concede to her, not grudgingly, but freely, all her rights; to\r\nnegotiate fairly and frankly with her as to the question of boundary;\r\nto render her, in a word, the fullest and most ample recompense for any\r\nloss she might convince us she had sustained, fully accords with the\r\nfeelings and views the Executive has always entertained.\r\n\r\nBut negotiation in advance of annexation would prove not only abortive,\r\nbut might be regarded as offensive to Mexico and insulting to Texas.\r\nMexico would not, I am persuaded, give ear for a moment to an attempt\r\nat negotiation in advance except for the whole territory of Texas.\r\nWhile all the world beside regards Texas as an independent power, Mexico\r\nchooses to look upon her as a revolted province. Nor could we negotiate\r\nwith Mexico for Texas without admitting that our recognition of her\r\nindependence was fraudulent, delusive, or void. It is only after\r\nacquiring Texas that the question of boundary can arise between the\r\nUnited States and Mexico--a question purposely left open for negotiation\r\nwith Mexico as affording the best opportunity for the most friendly and\r\npacific arrangements. The Executive has dealt with Texas as a power\r\nindependent of all others, both _de facto_ and _de jure_. She was an\r\nindependent State of the Confederation of Mexican Republics. When by\r\nviolent revolution Mexico declared the Confederation at an end, Texas\r\nowed her no longer allegiance, but claimed and has maintained the right\r\nfor eight years to a separate and distinct position. During that period\r\nno army has invaded her with a view to her reconquest; and if she has\r\nnot yet established her right to be treated as a nation independent _de\r\nfacto_ and _de jure_, it would be difficult to say at what period she\r\nwill attain to that condition.\r\n\r\nNor can we by any fair or any legitimate inference be accused of\r\nviolating any treaty stipulations with Mexico. The treaties with Mexico\r\ngive no guaranty of any sort and are coexistent with a similar treaty\r\nwith Texas. So have we treaties with most of the nations of the earth\r\nwhich are equally as much violated by the annexation of Texas to the\r\nUnited States as would be our treaty with Mexico. The treaty is merely\r\ncommercial and intended as the instrument for more accurately defining\r\nthe rights and securing the interests of the citizens of each country.\r\nWhat bad faith can be implied or charged upon the Government of the\r\nUnited States for successfully negotiating with an independent power\r\nupon any subject not violating the stipulations of such treaty I confess\r\nmy inability to discern.\r\n\r\nThe objections which have been taken to the enlargement of our territory\r\nwere urged with much zeal against the acquisition of Louisiana, and yet\r\nthe futility of such has long since been fully demonstrated. Since that\r\nperiod a new power has been introduced into the affairs of the world,\r\nwhich has for all practical purposes brought Texas much nearer to the\r\nseat of Government than Louisiana was at the time of its annexation.\r\nDistant regions are by the application of the steam engine brought\r\nwithin a close proximity.\r\n\r\nWith the views which I entertain on the subject, I should prove\r\nfaithless to the high trust which the Constitution has devolved upon me\r\nif I neglected to invite the attention of the representatives of the\r\npeople to it at the earliest moment that a due respect for the Senate\r\nwould allow me so to do. I should find in the urgency of the matter a\r\nsufficient apology, if one was wanting, since annexation is to encounter\r\na great, if not certain, hazard of final defeat if something be not\r\n_now_ done to prevent it. Upon this point I can not too impressively\r\ninvite your attention to my message of the 16th of May and to the\r\ndocuments which accompany it, which have not heretofore been made\r\npublic. If it be objected that the names of the writers of some of the\r\nprivate letters are withheld, all that I can say is that it is done\r\nfor reasons regarded as altogether adequate, and that the writers are\r\npersons of the first respectability and citizens of Texas, and have such\r\nmeans of obtaining information as to entitle their statements to full\r\ncredit. Nor has anything occurred to weaken, but, on the contrary, much\r\nto confirm, my confidence in the statements of General Jackson, and\r\nmy own statement, made at the close of that message, in the belief,\r\namounting almost to certainty, \"that instructions have already been\r\ngiven by the Texan Government to propose to the Government of Great\r\nBritain, forthwith on the failure [of the treaty], to enter into a\r\ntreaty of commerce and an alliance offensive and defensive.\"\r\n\r\nI also particularly invite your attention to the letter from Mr.\r\nEverett, our envoy at London, containing an account of a conversation in\r\nthe House of Lords which lately occurred between Lord Brougham and Lord\r\nAberdeen in relation to the question of annexation. Nor can I do so\r\nwithout the expression of some surprise at the language of the minister\r\nof foreign affairs employed upon the occasion. That a Kingdom which is\r\nmade what it now is by repeated acts of annexation--beginning with the\r\ntime of the heptarchy and concluding with the annexation of the Kingdoms\r\nof Ireland and Scotland--should perceive any principle either novel or\r\nserious in the late proceedings of the American Executive in regard to\r\nTexas is well calculated to excite surprise. If it be pretended that\r\nbecause of commercial or political relations which may exist between the\r\ntwo countries neither has a right to part with its sovereignty, and that\r\nno third power can change those relations by a voluntary treaty of union\r\nor annexation, then it would seem to follow that an annexation to be\r\nachieved by force of arms in the prosecution of a just and necessary war\r\ncould in no way be justified; and yet it is presumed that Great Britain\r\nwould be the last nation in the world to maintain any such doctrine.\r\nThe commercial and political relations of many of the countries of Europe\r\nhave undergone repeated changes by voluntary treaties, by conquest,\r\nand by partitions of their territories without any question as to the\r\nright under the public law. The question, in this view of it, can be\r\nconsidered as neither \"serious\" nor \"novel.\" I will not permit myself to\r\nbelieve that the British minister designed to bring himself to any such\r\nconclusion, but it is impossible for us to be blind to the fact that\r\nthe statements contained in Mr. Everett's dispatch are well worthy of\r\nserious consideration. The Government and people of the United States\r\nhave never evinced nor do they feel any desire to interfere in public\r\nquestions not affecting the relations existing between the States of the\r\nAmerican continent. We leave the European powers exclusive control over\r\nmatters affecting their continent and the relations of their different\r\nStates; the United States claim a similar exemption from any such\r\ninterference on their part. The treaty with Texas was negotiated from\r\nconsiderations of high public policy, influencing the conduct of the\r\ntwo Republics. We have treated with Texas as an independent power\r\nsolely with a view of bettering the condition of the two countries. If\r\nannexation in any form occur, it will arise from the free and unfettered\r\naction of the people of the two countries; and it seems altogether\r\nbecoming in me to say that the honor of the country, the dignity of the\r\nAmerican name, and the permanent interests of the United States would\r\nforbid acquiescence in any such interference. No one can more highly\r\nappreciate the value of peace to both Great Britain and the United\r\nStates and the capacity of each to do injury to the other than myself,\r\nbut peace can best be preserved by maintaining firmly the rights which\r\nbelong to us as an independent community.\r\n\r\nSo much have I considered it proper for me to say; and it becomes me\r\nonly to add that while I have regarded the annexation to be accomplished\r\nby treaty as the most suitable form in which it could be effected,\r\nshould Congress deem it proper to resort to any other expedient\r\ncompatible with the Constitution and likely to accomplish the object\r\nI stand prepared to yield my most prompt and active cooperation.\r\n\r\nThe great question is not as to the manner in which it shall be done,\r\nbut whether it shall be accomplished or not.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility of deciding this question is now devolved upon you.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 10, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 7th instant, upon the\r\nsubject of the supposed employment of Mr. Duff Green in Europe by the\r\nExecutive of the United States, I transmit a report from the Secretary\r\nof State, to whom the resolution was referred.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 12, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 4th instant,\r\ncalling for a correspondence[132] between the late minister of the\r\nUnited States in Mexico and the minister for foreign affairs of that\r\nRepublic, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State and the\r\ndocuments by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: On the subject of an order issued by the Mexican\r\nGovernment expelling all natives of the United States from Upper\r\nCalifornia and other departments of the Mexican Republic, and of\r\nthe order prohibiting foreigners the privilege of the retail trade\r\nin Mexico.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June, 12, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_;\r\n\r\nThe resolution of the Senate of the 3d instant, requesting the\r\nPresident to lay before that body, confidentially, \"a copy of any\r\ninstructions which may have been given by the Executive to the American\r\nminister in England on the subject of the title to and occupation of the\r\nTerritory of Oregon since the 4th of March, 1841; also a copy of any\r\ncorrespondence which may have passed between this Government and that\r\nof Great Britain in relation to the subject since that time,\" has been\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nIn reply I have to state that in the present state of the subject-matter\r\nto which the resolution refers it is deemed inexpedient to communicate\r\nthe information requested by the Senate.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 15, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives, in answer to their\r\nresolution of the 4th instant, a report from the Secretary of State, with\r\nthe correspondence[133] therein referred to.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: With Great Britain relative to the duties exacted by that\r\nGovernment on rough rice exported from the United States, contrary to\r\nthe treaty of 1815.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 17, 1844_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, in answer\r\nto a resolution of the 12th instant.

It is proper to say that Mr. Green\r\nafterwards presented a claim for an additional allowance, which has been\r\nneither allowed nor recognized as correct.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 17, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI have learned that the Senate has laid on the table the nomination,\r\nheretofore made, of Reuben H. Walworth to be an associate justice of the\r\nSupreme Court, in the place of Smith Thompson, deceased. I am informed\r\nthat a large amount of business has accumulated in the second district,\r\nand that the immediate appointment of a judge for that circuit is\r\nessential to the administration of justice. Under these circumstances I\r\nfeel it my duty to withdraw the name of Mr. Walworth, whose appointment\r\nthe Senate by their action seems not now prepared to confirm, in the\r\nhope that another name may be more acceptable.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which the Senate heretofore declined to advise\r\nand consent to the nomination of John C. Spencer have so far changed as\r\nto justify me in my again submitting his name to their consideration.\r\n\r\nI therefore nominate John C. Spencer, of New York, to be appointed an\r\nassociate justice of the Supreme Court, in the place of Smith Thompson,\r\ndeceased.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.[134]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: The first is a pocket veto.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 18, 1843_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI received within a few hours of the adjournment of the last Congress a\r\nresolution \"directing payment of the certificates or awards issued by\r\nthe commissioners under the treaty with the Cherokee Indians.\" Its\r\nprovisions involved principles of great importance, in reference to\r\nwhich it required more time to obtain the necessary information than\r\nwas allowed.\r\n\r\nThe balance of the fund provided by Congress for satisfying claims under\r\nthe seventeenth article of the Cherokee treaty, referred to in the\r\nresolution, is wholly insufficient to meet the claims still pending. To\r\ndirect the payment, therefore, of the whole amount of those claims which\r\nhappened to be first adjudicated would prevent a ratable distribution of\r\nthe fund among those equally entitled to its benefits. Such a violation\r\nof the individual rights of the claimants would impose upon the\r\nGovernment the obligation of making further appropriations to indemnify\r\nthem, and thus Congress would be obliged to enlarge a provision, liberal\r\nand equitable, which it had made for the satisfaction of all the demands\r\nof the Cherokees. I was unwilling to sanction a measure which would thus\r\nindirectly overturn the adjustment of our differences with the\r\nCherokees, accomplished with so much difficulty, and to which time is\r\nreconciling those Indians.\r\n\r\nIf no such indemnity should be provided, then a palpable and very gross\r\nwrong would be inflicted upon the claimants who had not been so\r\nfortunate as to have their claims taken up in preference to others.\r\nBesides, the fund having been appropriated by law to a specific purpose,\r\nin fulfillment of the treaty, it belongs to the Cherokees, and the\r\nauthority of this Government to direct its application to particular\r\nclaims is more than questionable.\r\n\r\nThe direction in the joint resolution, therefore, to pay the awards\r\nof the commissioners to the amount of $100,000 seemed to me quite\r\nobjectionable, and could not be approved.\r\n\r\nThe further direction that the certificates required to be issued by the\r\ntreaty, and in conformity with the practice of the board heretofore,\r\nshall be proper and sufficient vouchers, upon which payments shall be\r\nmade at the Treasury, is a departure from the system established soon\r\nafter the adoption of the Constitution and maintained ever since. That\r\nsystem requires that payments under the authority of any Department\r\nshall be made upon its requisition, countersigned by the proper Auditor\r\nand Comptroller. The greatest irregularity would ensue from the mode of\r\npayment prescribed by the resolution.\r\n\r\nI have deemed it respectful and proper to lay before the House of\r\nRepresentatives these reasons for having withheld my approval of the\r\nabove-mentioned joint resolution.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 11, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI return to the House of Representatives, in which it originated, the\r\nbill entitled \"An act making appropriations for the improvement of\r\ncertain harbors and rivers,\" with the following objections to its\r\nbecoming a law:\r\n\r\nAt the adoption of the Constitution each State was possessed of a\r\nseparate and independent sovereignty and an exclusive jurisdiction\r\nover all streams and water courses within its territorial limits.\r\nThe Articles of Confederation in no way affected this authority or\r\njurisdiction, and the present Constitution, adopted for the purpose of\r\ncorrecting the defects which existed in the original Articles, expressly\r\nreserves to the States all powers not delegated. No such surrender of\r\njurisdiction is made by the States to this Government by any express\r\ngrant, and if it is possessed it is to be deduced from the clause in the\r\nConstitution which invests Congress with authority \"to make all laws\r\nwhich are necessary and proper for carrying into execution\" the granted\r\npowers. There is, in my view of the subject, no pretense whatever for\r\nthe claim to power which the bill now returned substantially sets up.\r\nThe inferential power, in order to be legitimate, must be clearly and\r\nplainly incidental to some granted power and necessary to its exercise.\r\nTo refer it to the head of convenience or usefulness would be to throw\r\nopen the door to a boundless and unlimited discretion and to invest\r\nCongress with an unrestrained authority. The power to remove\r\nobstructions from the water courses of the States is claimed under the\r\ngranted power \"to regulate commerce with foreign nations, _among the\r\nseveral States_, and with the Indian tribes;\" but the plain and obvious\r\nmeaning of this grant is that Congress may adopt rules and regulations\r\nprescribing the terms and conditions on which the citizens of the United\r\nStates may carry on commercial operations with foreign states or\r\nkingdoms, and on which the citizens or subjects of foreign states or\r\nkingdoms may prosecute trade with the United States or either of them.\r\nAnd so the power to regulate commerce _among the several States_ no more\r\ninvests Congress with jurisdiction over the water courses of the States\r\nthan the first branch of the grant does over the water courses of\r\nforeign powers, which would be an absurdity.\r\n\r\nThe right of common use of the people of the United States to the\r\nnavigable waters of each and every State arises from the express\r\nstipulation contained in the Constitution that \"the citizens of each\r\nState shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in\r\nthe several States.\" While, therefore, the navigation of any river in\r\nany State is by the laws of such State allowed to the citizens thereof,\r\nthe same is also secured by the Constitution of the United States on the\r\nsame terms and conditions to the citizens of every other State; and so\r\nof any other privilege or immunity.\r\n\r\nThe application of the revenue of this Government, if the power to do\r\nso was admitted, to improving the navigation of the rivers by removing\r\nobstructions or otherwise would be for the most part productive only of\r\nlocal benefit. The consequences might prove disastrously ruinous to as\r\nmany of our fellow-citizens as the exercise of such power would benefit.\r\nI will take one instance furnished by the present bill--out of no\r\ninvidious feeling, for such it would be impossible for me to feel, but\r\nbecause of my greater familiarity with locations--in illustration of the\r\nabove opinion: Twenty thousand dollars are proposed to be appropriated\r\ntoward improving the harbor of Richmond, in the State of Virginia. Such\r\nimprovement would furnish advantages to the city of Richmond and add to\r\nthe value of the property of its citizens, while it might have a most\r\ndisastrous influence over the wealth and prosperity of Petersburg, which\r\nis situated some 25 miles distant on a branch of James River, and which\r\nnow enjoys its fair portion of the trade. So, too, the improvement of\r\nJames River to Richmond and of the Appomattox to Petersburg might, by\r\ninviting the trade to those two towns, have the effect of prostrating\r\nthe town of Norfolk. This, too, might be accomplished without adding a\r\nsingle vessel to the number now engaged in the trade of the Chesapeake\r\nBay or bringing into the Treasury a dollar of additional revenue. It\r\nwould produce, most probably, the single effect of concentrating the\r\ncommerce now profitably enjoyed by three places upon one of them. This\r\ncase furnishes an apt illustration of the effect of this bill in several\r\nother particulars.\r\n\r\nThere can not, in fact, be drawn the slightest discrimination between\r\nthe improving the streams of a State under the power to regulate\r\ncommerce and the most extended system of internal improvements on land.\r\nThe excavating a canal and paving a road are equally as much incidents\r\nto such claim of power as the removing obstructions from water courses;\r\nnor can such power be restricted by any fair course of reasoning to the\r\nmere fact of making the improvement. It reasonably extends also to the\r\nright of seeking a return of the means expended through the exaction of\r\ntolls and the levying of contributions. Thus, while the Constitution\r\ndenies to this Government the privilege of acquiring a property in the\r\nsoil of any State, even for the purpose of erecting a necessary\r\nfortification, without a grant from such State, this claim to power\r\nwould invest it with control and dominion over the waters and soil of\r\neach State without restriction. Power so incongruous can not exist in\r\nthe same instrument.\r\n\r\nThe bill is also liable to a serious objection because of its blending\r\nappropriations for numerous objects but few of which agree in their\r\ngeneral features. This necessarily produces the effect of embarrassing\r\nExecutive action. Some of the appropriations would receive my sanction\r\nif separated from the rest, however much I might deplore the\r\nreproduction of a system which for some time past has been permitted\r\nto sleep with apparently the acquiescence of the country. I might\r\nparticularize the Delaware Breakwater as an improvement which looks\r\nto the security from the storms of our extended Atlantic seaboard of\r\nthe vessels of all the country engaged either in the foreign or the\r\ncoastwise trade, as well as to the safety of the revenue; but when, in\r\nconnection with that, the same bill embraces improvements of rivers at\r\npoints far in the interior, connected alone with the trade of such river\r\nand the exertion of mere local influences, no alternative is left me but\r\nto use the qualified veto with which the Executive is invested by the\r\nConstitution, and to return the bill to the House in which it originated\r\nfor its ultimate reconsideration and decision.\r\n\r\nIn sanctioning a bill of the same title with that returned, for the\r\nimprovement of the Mississippi and its chief tributaries and certain\r\nharbors on the Lakes, if I bring myself apparently in conflict with any\r\nof the principles herein asserted it will arise on my part exclusively\r\nfrom the want of a just appreciation of localities. The Mississippi\r\noccupies a footing altogether different from the rivers and water\r\ncourses of the different States. No one State or any number of States\r\ncan exercise any other jurisdiction over it than for the punishment of\r\ncrimes and the service of civil process. It belongs to no particular\r\nState or States, but of common right, by express reservation, to all\r\nthe States. It is reserved as a great common highway for the commerce\r\nof the whole country. To have conceded to Louisiana, or to any other\r\nState admitted as a new State into the Union, the exclusive jurisdiction,\r\nand consequently the right to make improvements and to levy tolls on\r\nthe segments of the river embraced within its territorial limits, would\r\nhave been to have disappointed the chief object in the purchase of\r\nLouisiana, which was to secure the free use of the Mississippi to all\r\nthe people of the United States. Whether levies on commerce were made\r\nby a foreign or domestic government would have been equally burdensome\r\nand objectionable. The United States, therefore, is charged with\r\nits improvement for the benefit of all, and the appropriation of\r\ngovernmental means to its improvement becomes indispensably necessary\r\nfor the good of all.\r\n\r\nAs to the harbors on the Lakes, the act originates no new improvements,\r\nbut makes appropriations for the continuance of works already begun.\r\n\r\nIt is as much the duty of the Government to construct good harbors,\r\nwithout reference to the location or interests of cities, for the\r\nshelter of the extensive commerce of the Lakes as to build breakwaters\r\non the Atlantic coast for the protection of the trade of that ocean.\r\nThese great inland seas are visited by destructive storms, and the\r\nannual loss of ships and cargoes, and consequently of revenue to the\r\nGovernment, is immense. If, then, there be any work embraced by that act\r\nwhich is not required in order to afford shelter and security to the\r\nshipping against the tempests which so often sweep over those great\r\ninland seas, but has, on the contrary, originated more in a spirit of\r\nspeculation and local interest than in one of the character alluded to,\r\nthe House of Representatives will regard my approval of the bill more as\r\nthe result of misinformation than any design to abandon or modify the\r\nprinciples laid down in this message. Every system is liable to run into\r\nabuse, and none more so than that under consideration; and measures can\r\nnot be too soon taken by Congress to guard against this evil.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDERS.\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR[135]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: Sent to all diplomatic and consular officers of the\r\nUnited States.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, February 29, 1844_.\r\n\r\nSIR: It has become my most painful duty to announce to you the sudden\r\nand violent death of the Hon. Abel P. Upshur, late Secretary of State\r\nof the United States. This afflicting dispensation occurred on the\r\nafternoon of yesterday, from the bursting of one of the great guns on\r\nboard the Government steamship _Princeton_, near Alexandria, on her\r\nreturn from an excursion of pleasure down the river Potomac. By this\r\nmost unfortunate accident several of our distinguished citizens, amongst\r\nwhom were the Secretaries of State and of the Navy, were immediately\r\nkilled, and many other persons mortally wounded or severely injured.\r\nIt is the wish of the President that the diplomatic and consular agents\r\nof the United States, and all other officers connected with the State\r\nDepartment, either at home or abroad, shall wear the usual badge of\r\nmourning, in token of their grief and of respect for the memory of\r\nMr. Upshur, during thirty days from the time of receiving this order.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this event, the President has been pleased to charge\r\nme _ad interim_ with the direction of the Department of State, and I\r\nhave accordingly this day entered upon the duties of this appointment.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJNO. NELSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, _February 29, 1844_.\r\n\r\nIn the deepest grief the President of the United States has instructed\r\nthe undersigned to announce to the Army that from the accidental\r\nexplosion of a gun yesterday on board the United States steamship\r\n_Princeton_ the country and its Government lost at the same moment the\r\nSecretary of State, the Hon. A.P. Upshur, and the Secretary of the Navy,\r\nthe Hon. T.W. Gilmer.\r\n\r\nCalled but a few days since to preside over the administration of the\r\nWar Department, it is peculiarly painful to the undersigned that his\r\nfirst official communication to the Army should be the announcement of a\r\ncalamity depriving the country of the public services of two of our most\r\naccomplished statesmen and popular and deeply esteemed fellow-citizens.\r\nTheir virtues, talents, and patriotic services will ever be retained in\r\nthe grateful recollection of their countrymen and perpetuated upon the\r\npages of the history of our common country.\r\n\r\nDeep as may be the gloom which spreads over the community, it has\r\npleased the Almighty Disposer of Events to add another shade to it\r\nby blending in this melancholy catastrophe the deaths of an eminent\r\ncitizen, Virgil Maxcy, esq., lately chargé d'affaires to Belgium; a\r\ngallant and meritorious officer of the Navy, a chief of a bureau,\r\nCaptain B. Kennon, and a private citizen of New York of high and\r\nestimable character, besides others, citizens and sailors, either\r\nkilled or wounded.\r\n\r\nAs appropriate honors to the memory of these distinguished Secretaries,\r\nhalf-hour guns will be fired at every military post furnished with the\r\nproper ordnance the day after the receipt of this order from sunrise to\r\nsunset. The national flag will be displayed at half-staff during the\r\nsame time. And all officers of the Army will wear for three months the\r\ncustomary badge of mourning.\r\n\r\nWM. WILKINS\r\n  _Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDER.\r\n\r\nNAVY DEPARTMENT, _February 29, 1844_.\r\n\r\nAs a mark of respect to the memory of the late Hon. Thomas W. Gilmer,\r\nSecretary of the Navy, whose career at his entrance upon the duties of\r\nhis office, would have been nobly maintained by that ability and vigor\r\nof which his whole previous life had been the guaranty, the flags of all\r\nvessels in commission, navy-yards, and stations are to be hoisted at\r\nhalf-mast on the day after the receipt of this order, minute guns to the\r\nnumber of seventeen are to be fired between sunrise and sunset, and\r\ncrape is to be worn on the left arm and upon the sword for the space of\r\nthree months.\r\n\r\nBy command of the President:\r\n\r\nL. WARRINGTON,\r\n  _Secretary of the Navy ad interim_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 3, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nWe have continued cause for expressing our gratitude to the Supreme\r\nRuler of the Universe for the benefits and blessings which our country,\r\nunder His kind providence, has enjoyed during the past year.\r\nNotwithstanding the exciting scenes through which we have passed,\r\nnothing has occurred to disturb the general peace or to derange the\r\nharmony of our political system. The great moral spectacle has been\r\nexhibited of a nation approximating in number to 20,000,000 people\r\nhaving performed the high and important function of electing their Chief\r\nMagistrate for the term of four years without the commission of any acts\r\nof violence or the manifestation of a spirit of insubordination to the\r\nlaws. The great and inestimable right of suffrage has been exercised by\r\nall who were invested with it under the laws of the different States in\r\na spirit dictated alone by a desire, in the selection of the agent, to\r\nadvance the interests of the country and to place beyond jeopardy the\r\ninstitutions under which it is our happiness to live. That the deepest\r\ninterest has been manifested by all our countrymen in the result of\r\nthe election is not less true than highly creditable to them. Vast\r\nmultitudes have assembled from time to time at various places for the\r\npurpose of canvassing the merits and pretensions of those who were\r\npresented for their suffrages, but no armed soldiery has been necessary\r\nto restrain within proper limits the popular zeal or to prevent violent\r\noutbreaks. A principle much more controlling was found in the love of\r\norder and obedience to the laws, which, with mere individual exceptions,\r\neverywhere possesses the American mind, and controls with an influence\r\nfar more powerful than hosts of armed men. We can not dwell upon this\r\npicture without recognizing in it that deep and devoted attachment on\r\nthe part of the people to the institutions under which we live which\r\nproclaims their perpetuity. The great objection which has always\r\nprevailed against the election by the people of their chief executive\r\nofficer has been the apprehension of tumults and disorders which might\r\ninvolve in ruin the entire Government. A security against this is found\r\nnot only in the fact before alluded to, but in the additional fact that\r\nwe live under a Confederacy embracing already twenty-six States, no one\r\nof which has power to control the election. The popular vote in each\r\nState is taken at the time appointed by the laws, and such vote is\r\nannounced by the electoral college without reference to the decision of\r\nother States. The right of suffrage and the mode of conducting the\r\nelection are regulated by the laws of each State, and the election is\r\ndistinctly federative in all its prominent features. Thus it is that,\r\nunlike what might be the results under a consolidated system, riotous\r\nproceedings, should they prevail, could only affect the elections\r\nin single States without disturbing to any dangerous extent the\r\ntranquillity of others. The great experiment of a political\r\nconfederation each member of which is supreme as to all matters\r\nappertaining to its local interests and its internal peace and\r\nhappiness, while by a voluntary compact with others it confides to\r\nthe united power of all the protection of its citizens in matters not\r\ndomestic has been so far crowned with complete success. The world has\r\nwitnessed its rapid growth in wealth and population, and under the guide\r\nand direction of a superintending Providence the developments of the\r\npast may be regarded but as the shadowing forth of the mighty future.\r\nIn the bright prospects of that future we shall find, as patriots and\r\nphilanthropists, the highest inducements to cultivate and cherish a love\r\nof union and to frown down every measure or effort which may be made to\r\nalienate the States or the people of the States in sentiment and feeling\r\nfrom each other. A rigid and close adherence to the terms of our\r\npolitical compact and, above all, a sacred observance of the guaranties\r\nof the Constitution will preserve union on a foundation which can not\r\nbe shaken, while personal liberty is placed beyond hazard or jeopardy.\r\nThe guaranty of religious freedom, of the freedom of the press, of the\r\nliberty of speech, of the trial by jury, of the habeas corpus, and of\r\nthe domestic institutions of each of the States, leaving the private\r\ncitizen in the full exercise of the high and ennobling attributes of his\r\nnature and to each State the privilege (which can only be judiciously\r\nexerted by itself) of consulting the means best calculated to advance\r\nits own happiness--these are the great and important guaranties of the\r\nConstitution which the lovers of liberty must cherish and the advocates\r\nof union must ever cultivate. Preserving these and avoiding all\r\ninterpolations by forced construction under the guise of an imagined\r\nexpediency upon the Constitution, the influence of our political system\r\nis destined to be as actively and as beneficially felt on the distant\r\nshores of the Pacific as it is now on those of the Atlantic Ocean.\r\nThe only formidable impediments in the way of its successful expansion\r\n(time and space) are so far in the progress of modification by the\r\nimprovements of the age as to render no longer speculative the ability\r\nof representatives from that remote region to come up to the Capitol, so\r\nthat their constituents shall participate in all the benefits of Federal\r\nlegislation. Thus it is that in the progress of time the inestimable\r\nprinciples of civil liberty will be enjoyed by millions yet unborn\r\nand the great benefits of our system of government be extended to now\r\ndistant and uninhabited regions. In view of the vast wilderness yet to\r\nbe reclaimed, we may well invite the lover of freedom of every land to\r\ntake up his abode among us and assist us in the great work of advancing\r\nthe standard of civilization and giving a wider spread to the arts and\r\nrefinements of cultivated life. Our prayers should evermore be offered\r\nup to the Father of the Universe for His wisdom to direct us in the\r\npath of our duty so as to enable us to consummate these high purposes.\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest objections which has been urged against\r\nconfederacies by writers on government is the liability of the members\r\nto be tampered with by foreign governments or the people of foreign\r\nstates, either in their local affairs or in such as affected the peace\r\nof others or endangered the safety of the whole confederacy. We can not\r\nhope to be entirely exempt from such attempts on our peace and safety.\r\nThe United States are becoming too important in population and resources\r\nnot to attract the observation of other nations. It therefore may in the\r\nprogress of time occur that opinions entirely abstract in the States\r\nin which they may prevail and in no degree affecting their domestic\r\ninstitutions may be artfully but secretly encouraged with a view to\r\nundermine the Union. Such opinions may become the foundation of\r\npolitical parties, until at last the conflict of opinion, producing an\r\nalienation of friendly feeling among the people of the different States,\r\nmay involve in general destruction the happy institutions under which we\r\nlive. It should ever be borne in mind that what is true in regard to\r\nindividuals is equally so in regard to states. An interference of one in\r\nthe affairs of another is the fruitful cause of family dissensions and\r\nneighborhood disputes, and the same cause affects the peace, happiness,\r\nand prosperity of states. It may be most devoutly hoped that the good\r\nsense of the American people will ever be ready to repel all such\r\nattempts should they ever be made.\r\n\r\nThere has been no material change in our foreign relations since my last\r\nannual message to Congress. With all the powers of Europe we continue\r\non the most friendly terms. Indeed, it affords me much satisfaction to\r\nstate that at no former period has the peace of that enlightened and\r\nimportant quarter of the globe ever been, apparently, more firmly\r\nestablished. The conviction that peace is the true policy of nations\r\nwould seem to be growing and becoming deeper amongst the enlightened\r\neverywhere, and there is no people who have a stronger interest in\r\ncherishing the sentiments and adopting the means of preserving and\r\ngiving it permanence than those of the United States. Amongst these, the\r\nfirst and most effective are, no doubt, the strict observance of justice\r\nand the honest and punctual fulfillment of all engagements. But it is\r\nnot to be forgotten that in the present state of the world it is no less\r\nnecessary to be ready to enforce their observance and fulfillment in\r\nreference to ourselves than to observe and fulfill them on our part in\r\nregard to others.\r\n\r\nSince the close of your last session a negotiation has been formally\r\nentered upon between the Secretary of State and Her Britannic Majesty's\r\nminister plenipotentiary and envoy extraordinary residing at Washington\r\nrelative to the rights of their respective nations in and over the\r\nOregon Territory. That negotiation is still pending. Should it during\r\nyour session be brought to a definitive conclusion, the result will\r\nbe promptly communicated to Congress. I would, however, again call\r\nyour attention to the recommendations contained in previous messages\r\ndesigned to protect and facilitate emigration to that Territory. The\r\nestablishment of military posts at suitable points upon the extended\r\nline of land travel would enable our citizens to emigrate in comparative\r\nsafety to the fertile regions below the Falls of the Columbia, and make\r\nthe provision of the existing convention for the joint occupation of the\r\nterritory by subjects of Great Britain and the citizens of the United\r\nStates more available than heretofore to the latter. These posts would\r\nconstitute places of rest for the weary emigrant, where he would be\r\nsheltered securely against the danger of attack from the Indians and\r\nbe enabled to recover from the exhaustion of a long line of travel.\r\nLegislative enactments should also be made which should spread over him\r\nthe aegis of our laws, so as to afford protection to his person and\r\nproperty when he shall have reached his distant home. In this latter\r\nrespect the British Government has been much more careful of the\r\ninterests of such of her people as are to be found in that country than\r\nthe United States. She has made necessary provision for their security\r\nand protection against the acts of the viciously disposed and lawless,\r\nand her emigrant reposes in safety under the panoply of her laws.\r\nWhatever may be the result of the pending negotiation, such measures\r\nare necessary. It will afford me the greatest pleasure to witness a\r\nhappy and favorable termination to the existing negotiation upon terms\r\ncompatible with the public honor, and the best efforts of the Government\r\nwill continue to be directed to this end.\r\n\r\nIt would have given me the highest gratification in this my last annual\r\ncommunication to Congress to have been able to announce to you the\r\ncomplete and entire settlement and adjustment of other matters in\r\ndifference between the United States and the Government of Her Britannic\r\nMajesty, which were adverted to in a previous message. It is so\r\nobviously the interest of both countries, in respect to the large\r\nand valuable commerce which exists between them, that all causes\r\nof complaint, however inconsiderable, should be with the greatest\r\npromptitude removed that it must be regarded as cause of regret that any\r\nunnecessary delays should be permitted to intervene. It is true that\r\nin a pecuniary point of view the matters alluded to are altogether\r\ninsignificant in amount when compared with the ample resources of that\r\ngreat nation, but they nevertheless, more particularly that limited\r\nclass which arise under seizures and detentions of American ships on the\r\ncoast of Africa upon the mistaken supposition indulged in at the time\r\nthe wrong was committed of their being engaged in the slave trade,\r\ndeeply affect the sensibilities of this Government and people. Great\r\nBritain, having recognized her responsibility to repair all such wrongs\r\nby her action in other cases, leaves nothing to be regretted upon the\r\nsubject as to all cases arising prior to the treaty of Washington than\r\nthe delay in making suitable reparation in such of them as fall plainly\r\nwithin the principle of others which she has long since adjusted. The\r\ninjury inflicted by delays in the settlement of these claims falls with\r\nseverity upon the individual claimants and makes a strong appeal to her\r\nmagnanimity and sense of justice for a speedy settlement. Other matters\r\narising out of the construction of existing treaties also remain\r\nunadjusted, and will continue to be urged upon her attention.\r\n\r\nThe labors of the joint commission appointed by the two Governments\r\nto run the dividing line established by the treaty of Washington were,\r\nunfortunately, much delayed in the commencement of the season by the\r\nfailure of Congress at its last session to make a timely appropriation\r\nof funds to meet the expenses of the American party, and by other\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nThe United States commissioner, however, expresses his expectation that\r\nby increased diligence and energy the party will be able to make up for\r\nlost time.\r\n\r\nWe continue to receive assurances of the most friendly feelings on the\r\npart of all the other European powers, with each and all of whom it is\r\nso obviously our interest to cultivate the most amicable relations; nor\r\ncan I anticipate the occurrence of any event which would be likely in\r\nany degree to disturb those relations. Russia, the great northern power,\r\nunder the judicious sway of her Emperor, is constantly advancing in the\r\nroad of science and improvement, while France, guided by the counsels of\r\nher wise Sovereign, pursues a course calculated to consolidate the\r\ngeneral peace. Spain has obtained a breathing spell of some duration\r\nfrom the internal convulsions which have through so many years marred\r\nher prosperity, while Austria, the Netherlands, Prussia, Belgium, and\r\nthe other powers of Europe reap a rich harvest of blessings from the\r\nprevailing peace.\r\n\r\nI informed the two Houses of Congress in my message of December last\r\nthat instructions had been given to Mr. Wheaton, our minister at Berlin,\r\nto negotiate a treaty with the Germanic States composing the Zollverein\r\nif it could be done, stipulating, as far as it was practicable to\r\naccomplish it, for a reduction of the heavy and onerous duties levied on\r\nour tobacco and other leading articles of agricultural production, and\r\nyielding in return on our part a reduction of duties on such articles\r\nthe product of their industry as should not come into competition,\r\nor but a limited one, with articles the product of our manufacturing\r\nindustry. The Executive in giving such instructions considered itself as\r\nacting in strict conformity with the wishes of Congress as made known\r\nthrough several measures which it had adopted, all directed to the\r\naccomplishment of this important result. The treaty was therefore\r\nnegotiated, by which essential reductions were secured in the duties\r\nlevied by the Zollverein on tobacco, rice, and lard, accompanied by a\r\nstipulation for the admission of raw cotton free of duty; in exchange\r\nfor which highly important concessions a reduction of duties imposed by\r\nthe laws of the United States on a variety of articles, most of which\r\nwere admitted free of all duty under the act of Congress commonly known\r\nas the compromise law, and but few of which were produced in the United\r\nStates, was stipulated for on our part. This treaty was communicated to\r\nthe Senate at an early day of its last session, but not acted upon until\r\nnear its close, when, for the want (as I am bound to presume) of full\r\ntime to consider it, it was laid upon the table. This procedure had\r\nthe effect of virtually rejecting it, in consequence of a stipulation\r\ncontained in the treaty that its ratifications should be exchanged on or\r\nbefore a day which has already passed. The Executive, acting upon the\r\nfair inference that the Senate did not intend its absolute rejection,\r\ngave instructions to our minister at Berlin to reopen the negotiation so\r\nfar as to obtain an extension of time for the exchange of ratifications.\r\nI regret, however, to say that his efforts in this respect have been\r\nunsuccessful. I am nevertheless not without hope that the great\r\nadvantages which were intended to be secured by the treaty may yet\r\nbe realized.\r\n\r\nI am happy to inform you that Belgium has, by an \"_arrêté royale_\"\r\nissued in July last, assimilated the flag of the United States to her\r\nown, so far as the direct trade between the two countries is concerned.\r\nThis measure will prove of great service to our shipping interest, the\r\ntrade having heretofore been carried on chiefly in foreign bottoms.\r\nI flatter myself that she will speedily resort to a modification of her\r\nsystem relating to the tobacco trade, which would decidedly benefit the\r\nagriculture of the United States and operate to the mutual advantage of\r\nboth countries.\r\n\r\nNo definitive intelligence has yet been received from our minister of\r\nthe conclusion of a treaty with the Chinese Empire, but enough is known\r\nto induce the strongest hopes that the mission will be crowned with\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nWith Brazil our relations continue on the most friendly footing. The\r\ncommercial intercourse between that growing Empire and the United States\r\nis becoming daily of greater importance to both, and it is to the\r\ninterest of both that the firmest relations of amity and good will\r\nshould continue to be cultivated between them.\r\n\r\nThe Republic of New Granada still withholds, notwithstanding the most\r\npersevering efforts have been employed by our chargé d'affaires, Mr.\r\nBlackford, to produce a different result, indemnity in the case of the\r\nbrig _Morris_; and the Congress of Venezuela, although an arrangement\r\nhas been effected between our minister and the minister of foreign\r\naffairs of that Government for the payment of $18,000 in discharge of\r\nits liabilities in the same case, has altogether neglected to make\r\nprovision for its payment. It is to be hoped that a sense of justice\r\nwill soon induce a settlement of these claims.\r\n\r\nOur late minister to Chili, Mr. Pendleton, has returned to the United\r\nStates without having effected an adjustment in the second claim of the\r\n_Macedonian_, which is delayed on grounds altogether frivolous and\r\nuntenable. Mr. Pendleton's successor has been directed to urge the claim\r\nin the strongest terms, and, in the event of a failure to obtain a\r\nprompt adjustment, to report the fact to the Executive at as early a day\r\nas possible, so that the whole matter may be communicated to Congress.\r\n\r\nAt your last session I submitted to the attention of Congress the\r\nconvention with the Republic of Peru of the 17th March, 1841, providing\r\nfor the adjustment of the claims of citizens of the United States\r\nagainst that Republic, but no definitive action was taken upon the\r\nsubject. I again invite to it your attention and prompt action.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I felt it to be my duty to make known to\r\nCongress, in terms both plain and emphatic, my opinion in regard to the\r\nwar which has so long existed between Mexico and Texas, which since the\r\nbattle of San Jacinto has consisted altogether of predatory incursions,\r\nattended by circumstances revolting to humanity. I repeat now what I\r\nthen said, that after eight years of feeble and ineffectual efforts to\r\nreconquer Texas it was time that the war should have ceased. The United\r\nStates have a direct interest in the question. The contiguity of the\r\ntwo nations to our territory was but too well calculated to involve our\r\npeace. Unjust suspicions were engendered in the mind of one or the other\r\nof the belligerents against us, and as a necessary consequence American\r\ninterests were made to suffer and our peace became daily endangered; in\r\naddition to which it must have been obvious to all that the exhaustion\r\nproduced by the war subjected both Mexico and Texas to the interference\r\nof other powers, which, without the interposition of this Government,\r\nmight eventuate in the most serious injury to the United States. This\r\nGovernment from time to time exerted its friendly offices to bring about\r\na termination of hostilities upon terms honorable alike to both the\r\nbelligerents. Its efforts in this behalf proved unavailing. Mexico\r\nseemed almost without an object to persevere in the war, and no other\r\nalternative was left the Executive but to take advantage of the\r\nwell-known dispositions of Texas and to invite her to enter into\r\na treaty for annexing her territory to that of the United States.\r\n\r\nSince your last session Mexico has threatened to renew the war, and has\r\neither made or proposes to make formidable preparations for invading\r\nTexas. She has issued decrees and proclamations, preparatory to the\r\ncommencement of hostilities, full of threats revolting to humanity,\r\nand which if carried into effect would arouse the attention of all\r\nChristendom. This new demonstration of feeling, there is too much reason\r\nto believe, has been produced inconsequence of the negotiation of the\r\nlate treaty of annexation with Texas. The Executive, therefore, could\r\nnot be indifferent to such proceedings, and it felt it to be due as well\r\nto itself as to the honor of the country that a strong representation\r\nshould be made to the Mexican Government upon the subject. This was\r\naccordingly done, as will be seen by the copy of the accompanying\r\ndispatch from the Secretary of State to the United States envoy at\r\nMexico. Mexico has no right to jeopard the peace of the world by urging\r\nany longer a useless and fruitless contest. Such a condition of things\r\nwould not be tolerated on the European continent. Why should it be on\r\nthis? A war of desolation, such as is now threatened by Mexico, can not\r\nbe waged without involving our peace and tranquillity. It is idle to\r\nbelieve that such a war could be looked upon with indifference by our\r\nown citizens inhabiting adjoining States; and our neutrality would be\r\nviolated in despite of all efforts on the part of the Government to\r\nprevent it. The country is settled by emigrants from the United States\r\nunder invitations held out to them by Spain and Mexico. Those emigrants\r\nhave left behind them friends and relatives, who would not fail to\r\nsympathize with them in their difficulties, and who would be led by\r\nthose sympathies to participate in their struggles, however energetic\r\nthe action of the Government to prevent it. Nor would the numerous\r\nand formidable bands of Indians--the most warlike to be found in any\r\nland--which occupy the extensive regions contiguous to the States of\r\nArkansas and Missouri, and who are in possession of large tracts of\r\ncountry within the limits of Texas, be likely to remain passive. The\r\ninclinations of those numerous tribes lead them invariably to war\r\nwhenever pretexts exist.\r\n\r\nMexico had no just ground of displeasure against this Government or\r\npeople for negotiating the treaty. What interest of hers was affected by\r\nthe treaty? She was despoiled of nothing, since Texas was forever lost\r\nto her. The independence of Texas was recognized by several of the\r\nleading powers of the earth. She was free to treat, free to adopt her\r\nown line of policy, free to take the course which she believed was best\r\ncalculated to secure her happiness.\r\n\r\nHer Government and people decided on annexation to the United States,\r\nand the Executive saw in the acquisition of such a territory the means\r\nof advancing their permanent happiness and glory. What principle of good\r\nfaith, then, was violated? What rule of political morals trampled under\r\nfoot? So far as Mexico herself was concerned, the measure should have\r\nbeen regarded by her as highly beneficial. Her inability to reconquer\r\nTexas had been exhibited, I repeat, by eight (now nine) years of\r\nfruitless and ruinous contest. In the meantime Texas has been growing\r\nin population and resources. Emigration has flowed into her territory\r\nfrom all parts of the world in a current which continues to increase\r\nin strength. Mexico requires a permanent boundary between that young\r\nRepublic and herself. Texas at no distant day, if she continues separate\r\nand detached from the United States, will inevitably seek to consolidate\r\nher strength by adding to her domain the contiguous Provinces of Mexico.\r\nThe spirit of revolt from the control of the central Government has\r\nheretofore manifested itself in some of those Provinces, and it is\r\nfair to infer that they would be inclined to take the first favorable\r\nopportunity to proclaim their independence and to form close alliances\r\nwith Texas. The war would thus be endless, or if cessations of\r\nhostilities should occur they would only endure for a season. The\r\ninterests of Mexico, therefore, could in nothing be better consulted\r\nthan in a peace with her neighbors which would result in the\r\nestablishment of a permanent boundary. Upon the ratification of the\r\ntreaty the Executive was prepared to treat with her on the most liberal\r\nbasis. Hence the boundaries of Texas were left undefined by the treaty.\r\nThe Executive proposed to settle these upon terms that all the world\r\nshould have pronounced just and reasonable. No negotiation upon that\r\npoint could have been undertaken between the United States and Mexico in\r\nadvance of the ratification of the treaty. We should have had no right,\r\nno power, no authority, to have conducted such a negotiation, and to\r\nhave undertaken it would have been an assumption equally revolting\r\nto the pride of Mexico and Texas and subjecting us to the charge of\r\narrogance, while to have proposed in advance of annexation to satisfy\r\nMexico for any contingent interest she might have in Texas would have\r\nbeen to have treated Texas not as an independent power, but as a mere\r\ndependency of Mexico. This assumption could not have been acted on by\r\nthe Executive without setting at defiance your own solemn declaration\r\nthat that Republic was an independent State. Mexico had, it is true,\r\nthreatened War against the United States in the event the treaty of\r\nannexation was ratified. The Executive could not permit itself to be\r\ninfluenced by this threat. It represented ill this the spirit of our\r\npeople, who are ready to sacrifice much for peace, but nothing to\r\nintimidation. A war under any circumstances is greatly to be deplored,\r\nand the United States is the last nation to desire it; but if, as the\r\ncondition of peace, it be required of us to forego the unquestionable\r\nright of treating with an independent power of our own continent upon\r\nmatters highly interesting to both, and that upon a naked and\r\nunsustained pretension of claim by a third power to control the free\r\nwill of the power with whom we treat, devoted as we may be to peace\r\nand anxious to cultivate friendly relations with the whole world, the\r\nExecutive does not hesitate to say that the people of the United States\r\nwould be ready to brave all consequences sooner than submit to such\r\ncondition. But no apprehension of war was entertained by the Executive,\r\nand I must express frankly the opinion that had the treaty been ratified\r\nby the Senate it would have been followed by a prompt settlement, to the\r\nentire satisfaction of Mexico, of every matter in difference between the\r\ntwo countries. Seeing, then, that new preparations for hostile invasion\r\nof Texas were about to be adopted by Mexico, and that these were brought\r\nabout because Texas had adopted the suggestions of the Executive upon\r\nthe subject of annexation, it could not passively have folded its arms\r\nand permitted a war, threatened to be accompanied by every act that\r\ncould mark a barbarous age, to be waged against her because she had\r\ndone so.\r\n\r\nOther considerations of a controlling character influenced the course\r\nof the Executive. The treaty which had thus been negotiated had failed\r\nto receive the ratification of the Senate. One of the chief objections\r\nwhich was urged against it was found to consist in the fact that the\r\nquestion of annexation had not been submitted to the ordeal of public\r\nopinion in the United States. However untenable such an objection was\r\nesteemed to be, in view of the unquestionable power of the Executive to\r\nnegotiate the treaty and the great and lasting interests involved in\r\nthe question, I felt it to be my duty to submit the whole subject to\r\nCongress as the best expounders of popular sentiment. No definitive\r\naction having been taken on the subject by Congress, the question\r\nreferred itself directly to the decision of the States and people.\r\nThe great popular election which has just terminated afforded the best\r\nopportunity of ascertaining the will of the States and the people upon\r\nit. Pending that issue it became the imperative duty of the Executive\r\nto inform Mexico that the question of annexation was still before the\r\nAmerican people, and that until their decision was pronounced any\r\nserious invasion of Texas would be regarded as an attempt to forestall\r\ntheir judgment and could not be looked upon with indifference. I am most\r\nhappy to inform you that no such invasion has taken place; and I trust\r\nthat whatever your action may be upon it Mexico will see the importance\r\nof deciding the matter by a resort to peaceful expedients in preference\r\nto those of arms. The decision of the people and the States on this\r\ngreat and interesting subject has been decisively manifested.\r\nThe question of annexation has been presented nakedly to their\r\nconsideration. By the treaty itself all collateral and incidental issues\r\nwhich were calculated to divide and distract the public councils were\r\ncarefully avoided. These were left to the wisdom of the future to\r\ndetermine. It presented, I repeat, the isolated question of annexation,\r\nand in that form it has been submitted to the ordeal of public\r\nsentiment. A controlling majority of the people and a large majority of\r\nthe States have declared in favor of immediate annexation. Instructions\r\nhave thus come up to both branches of Congress from their respective\r\nconstituents in terms the most emphatic. It is the will of both the\r\npeople and the States that Texas shall be annexed to the Union promptly\r\nand immediately. It may be hoped that in carrying into execution the\r\npublic will thus declared all collateral issues may be avoided. Future\r\nLegislatures can best decide as to the number of States which should be\r\nformed out of the territory when the time has arrived for deciding that\r\nquestion. So with all others. By the treaty the United States assumed\r\nthe payment of the debts of Texas to an amount not exceeding\r\n$10,000,000, to be paid, with the exception of a sum falling short of\r\n$400,000, exclusively out of the proceeds of the sales of her public\r\nlands. We could not with honor take the lands without assuming the full\r\npayment of all incumbrances upon them.\r\n\r\nNothing has occurred since your last session to induce a doubt\r\nthat the dispositions of Texas remain unaltered. No intimation of an\r\naltered determination on the part of her Government and people has been\r\nfurnished to the Executive. She still desires to throw herself under\r\nthe protection of our laws and to partake of the blessings of our\r\nfederative system, while every American interest would seem to require\r\nit. The extension of our coastwise and foreign trade to an amount almost\r\nincalculable, the enlargement of the market for our manufactures, a\r\nconstantly growing market for our agricultural productions, safety to\r\nour frontiers, and additional strength and stability to the Union--these\r\nare the results which would rapidly develop themselves upon the\r\nconsummation of the measure of annexation. In such event I will not\r\ndoubt but that Mexico would find her true interest to consist in meeting\r\nthe advances of this Government in a spirit of amity. Nor do I apprehend\r\nany serious complaint from any other quarter; no sufficient ground\r\nexists for such complaint. We should interfere in no respect with the\r\nrights of any other nation. There can not be gathered from the act any\r\ndesign on our part to do so with their possessions on this continent.\r\nWe have interposed no impediments in the way of such acquisitions of\r\nterritory, large and extensive as many of them are, as the leading\r\npowers of Europe have made from time to time in every part of the world.\r\nWe seek no conquest made by war. No intrigue will have been resorted to\r\nor acts of diplomacy essayed to accomplish the annexation of Texas. Free\r\nand independent herself, she asks to be received into our Union. It is\r\na question for our own decision whether she shall be received or not.\r\n\r\nThe two Governments having already agreed through their respective\r\norgans on the terms of annexation, I would recommend their adoption by\r\nCongress in the form of a joint resolution or act to be perfected and\r\nmade binding on the two countries when adopted in like manner by the\r\nGovernment of Texas.\r\n\r\nIn order that the subject may be fully presented in all its bearings,\r\nthe correspondence which has taken place in reference to it since the\r\nadjournment of Congress between the United States, Texas, and Mexico is\r\nherewith transmitted.\r\n\r\nThe amendments proposed by the Senate to the convention concluded\r\nbetween the United States and Mexico on the 20th of November, 1843, have\r\nbeen transmitted through our minister for the concurrence of the Mexican\r\nGovernment, but, although urged thereto, no action has yet been had on\r\nthe subject, nor has any answer been given which would authorize a\r\nfavorable conclusion in the future.\r\n\r\nThe decree of September, 1843, in relation to the retail trade, the\r\norder for the expulsion of foreigners, and that of a more recent date\r\nin regard to passports--all which are considered as in violation of\r\nthe treaty of amity and commerce between the two countries--have led\r\nto a correspondence of considerable length between the minister for\r\nforeign relations and our representatives at Mexico, but without any\r\nsatisfactory result. They remain still unadjusted, and many and serious\r\ninconveniences have already resulted to our citizens in consequence of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nQuestions growing out of the act of disarming a body of Texan troops\r\nunder the command of Major Snively by an officer in the service of\r\nthe United States, acting under the orders of our Government, and the\r\nforcible entry into the custom-house at Bryarlys Landing, on Red River,\r\nby certain citizens of the United States, and taking away therefrom the\r\ngoods seized by the collector of the customs as forfeited under the laws\r\nof Texas, have been adjusted so far as the powers of the Executive\r\nextend. The correspondence between the two Governments in reference\r\nto both subjects will be found amongst the accompanying documents.\r\nIt contains a full statement of all the facts and circumstances, with\r\nthe views taken on both sides and the principles on which the questions\r\nhave been adjusted. It remains for Congress to make the necessary\r\nappropriation to carry the arrangement into effect, which I respectfully\r\nrecommend.\r\n\r\nThe greatly improved condition of the Treasury affords a subject for\r\ngeneral congratulation. The paralysis which had fallen on trade and\r\ncommerce, and which subjected the Government to the necessity of\r\nresorting to loans and the issue of Treasury notes to a large amount,\r\nhas passed away, and after the payment of upward of $7,000,000 on\r\naccount of the interest, and in redemption of more than $5,000,000 of\r\nthe public debt which falls due on the 1st of January next, and setting\r\napart upward of $2,000,000 for the payment of outstanding Treasury notes\r\nand meeting an installment of the debts of the corporate cities of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, an estimated surplus of upward of $7,000,000 over\r\nand above the existing appropriations will remain in the Treasury at the\r\nclose of the fiscal year. Should the Treasury notes continue outstanding\r\nas heretofore, that surplus will be considerably augmented. Although\r\nall interest has ceased upon them and the Government has invited their\r\nreturn to the Treasury, yet they remain outstanding, affording great\r\nfacilities to commerce, and establishing the fact that under a\r\nwell-regulated system of finance the Government has resources within\r\nitself which render it independent in time of need, not only of private\r\nloans, but also of bank facilities.\r\n\r\nThe only remaining subject of regret is that the remaining stocks of the\r\nGovernment do not fall due at an earlier day, since their redemption\r\nwould be entirely within its control. As it is, it may be well worthy\r\nthe consideration of Congress whether the law establishing the sinking\r\nfund (under the operation of which the debts of the Revolution and last\r\nwar with Great Britain were to a great extent extinguished) should not,\r\nwith proper modifications, so as to prevent an accumulation of\r\nsurpluses, and limited in amount to a specific sum, be reenacted. Such\r\nprovision, which would authorize the Government to go into the market\r\nfor a purchase of its own stock on fair terms, would serve to maintain\r\nits credit at the highest point and prevent to a great extent those\r\nfluctuations in the price of its securities which might under other\r\ncircumstances affect its credit. No apprehension of this sort is at this\r\nmoment entertained, since the stocks of the Government, which but two\r\nyears ago were offered for sale to capitalists at home and abroad at a\r\ndepreciation, and could find no purchasers, are now greatly above par in\r\nthe hands of the holders; but a wise and prudent forecast admonishes us\r\nto place beyond the reach of contingency the public credit.\r\n\r\nIt must also be a matter of unmingled gratification that under the\r\nexisting financial system (resting upon the act of 1789 and the\r\nresolution of 1816) the currency of the country has attained a state of\r\nperfect soundness; and the rates of exchange between different parts\r\nof the Union, which in 1841 denoted by their enormous amount the great\r\ndepreciation and, in fact, worthlessness of the currency in most of\r\nthe States, are now reduced to little more than the mere expense of\r\ntransporting specie from place to place and the risk incident to the\r\noperation. In a new country like that of the United States, where so\r\nmany inducements are held out for speculation, the depositories of the\r\nsurplus revenue, consisting of banks of any description, when it reaches\r\nany considerable amount, require the closest vigilance on the part of\r\nthe Government. All banking institutions, under whatever denomination\r\nthey may pass, are governed by an almost exclusive regard to the\r\ninterest of the stockholders. That interest consists in the augmentation\r\nof profits in the form of dividends, and a large surplus revenue\r\nintrusted to their custody is but too apt to lead to excessive loans\r\nand to extravagantly large issues of paper. As a necessary consequence\r\nprices are nominally increased and the speculative mania very soon\r\nseizes upon the public mind. A fictitious state of prosperity for a\r\nseason exists, and, in the language of the day, money becomes plenty.\r\nContracts are entered into by individuals resting on this unsubstantial\r\nstate of things, but the delusion speedily passes away and the country\r\nis overrun with an indebtedness so weighty as to overwhelm many and to\r\nvisit every department of industry with great and ruinous embarrassment.\r\nThe greatest vigilance becomes necessary on the part of Government to\r\nguard against this state of things. The depositories must be given\r\ndistinctly to understand that the favors of the Government will be\r\naltogether withdrawn, or substantially diminished, if its revenues shall\r\nbe regarded as additions to their banking capital or as the foundation\r\nof an enlarged circulation.\r\n\r\nThe Government, through its revenue, has at all times an important part\r\nto perform in connection with the currency, and it greatly depends upon\r\nits vigilance and care whether the country be involved in embarrassments\r\nsimilar to those which it has had recently to encounter, or, aided by\r\nthe action of the Treasury, shall be preserved in a sound and healthy\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe dangers to be guarded against are greatly augmented by too large a\r\nsurplus of revenue. When that surplus greatly exceeds in amount what\r\nshall be required by a wise and prudent forecast to meet unforeseen\r\ncontingencies, the Legislature itself may come to be seized with a\r\ndisposition to indulge in extravagant appropriations to objects many\r\nof which may, and most probably would, be found to conflict with the\r\nConstitution. A fancied expediency is elevated above constitutional\r\nauthority, and a reckless and wasteful extravagance but too certainly\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nThe important power of taxation, which when exercised in its most\r\nrestricted form is a burthen on labor and production, is resorted to\r\nunder various pretexts for purposes having no affinity to the motives\r\nwhich dictated its grant, and the extravagance of Government stimulates\r\nindividual extravagance until the spirit of a wild and ill-regulated\r\nspeculation involves one and all in its unfortunate results. In view of\r\nsuch fatal consequences, it may be laid down as an axiom founded in\r\nmoral and political truth that no greater taxes should be imposed than\r\nare necessary for an economical administration of the Government, and\r\nthat whatever exists beyond should be reduced or modified. This doctrine\r\ndoes in no way conflict with the exercise of a sound discrimination in\r\nthe selection of the articles to be taxed, which a due regard to the\r\npublic weal would at all times suggest to the legislative mind. It\r\nleaves the range of selection undefined; and such selection should\r\nalways be made with an eye to the great interests of the country.\r\nComposed as is the Union of separate and independent States, a patriotic\r\nLegislature will not fail in consulting the interests of the parts to\r\nadopt such course as will be best calculated to advance the harmony\r\nof the whole, and thus insure that permanency in the policy of the\r\nGovernment without which all efforts to advance the public prosperity\r\nare vain and fruitless.\r\n\r\nThis great and vitally important task rests with Congress, and the\r\nExecutive can do no more than recommend the general principles which\r\nshould govern in its execution.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the report of the Secretary of War for an exhibition of\r\nthe condition of the Army, and recommend to you as well worthy your best\r\nconsideration many of the suggestions it contains. The Secretary in no\r\ndegree exaggerates the great importance of pressing forward without\r\ndelay in the work of erecting and finishing the fortifications to which\r\nhe particularly alludes. Much has been done toward placing our cities\r\nand roadsteads in a state of security against the hazards of hostile\r\nattack within the last four years; but considering the new elements\r\nwhich have been of late years employed in the propelling of ships\r\nand the formidable implements of destruction which have been brought\r\ninto service, we can not be too active or vigilant in preparing and\r\nperfecting the means of defense. I refer you also to his report for\r\na full statement of the condition of the Indian tribes within our\r\njurisdiction. The Executive has abated no effort in carrying into effect\r\nthe well-established policy of the Government which contemplates a\r\nremoval of all the tribes residing within the limits of the several\r\nStates beyond those limits, and it is now enabled to congratulate the\r\ncountry at the prospect of an early consummation of this object. Many of\r\nthe tribes have already made great progress in the arts of civilized\r\nlife, and through the operation of the schools established among them,\r\naided by the efforts of the pious men of various religious denominations\r\nwho devote themselves to the task of their improvement, we may fondly\r\nhope that the remains of the formidable tribes which were once masters\r\nof this country will in their transition from the savage state to a\r\ncondition of refinement and cultivation add another bright trophy to\r\nadorn the labors of a well-directed philanthropy.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy will explain to you\r\nthe situation of that branch of the service. The present organization of\r\nthe Department imparts to its operations great efficiency, but I concur\r\nfully in the propriety of a division of the Bureau of Construction,\r\nEquipment, Increase, and Repairs into two bureaus. The subjects as now\r\narranged are incongruous, and require to a certain extent information\r\nand qualifications altogether dissimilar.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the squadron on the coast of Africa have been\r\nconducted with all due attention to the object which led to its\r\norigination, and I am happy to say that the officers and crews have\r\nenjoyed the best possible health under the system adopted by the officer\r\nin command. It is believed that the United States is the only nation\r\nwhich has by its laws subjected to the punishment of death as pirates\r\nthose who may be engaged in the slave trade. A similar enactment on the\r\npart of other nations would not fail to be attended by beneficial\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the difficulties which have existed in the way of\r\nsecuring titles for the necessary grounds, operations have not yet been\r\ncommenced toward the establishment of the navy-yard at Memphis. So soon\r\nas the title is perfected no further delay will be permitted to\r\nintervene. It is well worthy of your consideration whether Congress\r\nshould not direct the establishment of a ropewalk in connection with the\r\ncontemplated navy-yard, as a measure not only of economy, but as highly\r\nuseful and necessary. The only establishment of the sort now connected\r\nwith the service is located at Boston, and the advantages of a similar\r\nestablishment convenient to the hemp-growing region must be apparent to\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary presents other matters to your consideration\r\nof an important character in connection with the service.\r\n\r\nIn referring you to the accompanying report of the Postmaster-General it\r\naffords me continued cause of gratification to be able to advert to the\r\nfact that the affairs of the Department for the last four years have\r\nbeen so conducted as from its unaided resources to meet its large\r\nexpenditures. On my coming into office a debt of nearly $500,000 existed\r\nagainst the Department, which Congress discharged by an appropriation\r\nfrom the Treasury. The Department on the 4th of March next will be\r\nfound, under the management of its present efficient head, free of debt\r\nor embarrassment, which could only have been done by the observance and\r\npractice of the greatest vigilance and economy. The laws have\r\ncontemplated throughout that the Department should be self-sustained,\r\nbut it may become necessary, with the wisest regard to the public\r\ninterests, to introduce amendments and alterations in the system.\r\n\r\nThere is a strong desire manifested in many quarters so to alter the\r\ntariff of letter postage as to reduce the amount of tax at present\r\nimposed. Should such a measure be carried into effect to the full extent\r\ndesired, it can not well be doubted but that for the first years of its\r\noperation a diminished revenue would be collected, the supply of which\r\nwould necessarily constitute a charge upon the Treasury. Whether such\r\na result would be desirable it will be for Congress in its wisdom\r\nto determine. It may in general be asserted as true that radical\r\nalterations in any system should rather be brought about gradually than\r\nby sudden changes, and by pursuing this prudent policy in the reduction\r\nof letter postage the Department might still sustain itself through the\r\nrevenue which would accrue by the increase of letters. The state and\r\ncondition of the public Treasury has heretofore been such as to have\r\nprecluded the recommendation of any material change. The difficulties\r\nupon this head have, however, ceased, and a larger discretion is now\r\nleft to the Government.\r\n\r\nI can not too strongly urge the policy of authorizing the establishment\r\nof a line of steamships regularly to ply between this country and\r\nforeign ports and upon our own waters for the transportation of the\r\nmail. The example of the British Government is well worthy of imitation\r\nin this respect. The belief is strongly entertained that the emoluments\r\narising from the transportation of mail matter to foreign countries\r\nwould operate of itself as an inducement to cause individual enterprise\r\nto undertake that branch of the task, and the remuneration of the\r\nGovernment would consist in the addition readily made to our steam navy\r\nin case of emergency by the ships so employed. Should this suggestion\r\nmeet your approval, the propriety of placing such ships under the\r\ncommand of experienced officers of the Navy will not escape your\r\nobservation. The application of steam to the purposes of naval warfare\r\ncogently recommends an extensive steam marine as important in estimating\r\nthe defenses of the country. Fortunately this may be obtained by us\r\nto a great extent without incurring any large amount of expenditure.\r\nSteam vessels to be engaged in the transportation of the mails on our\r\nprincipal water courses, lakes, and ports of our coast could also be so\r\nconstructed as to be efficient as war vessels when needed, and would of\r\nthemselves constitute a formidable force in order to repel attacks from\r\nabroad. We can not be blind to the fact that other nations have already\r\nadded large numbers of steamships to their naval armaments and that this\r\nnew and powerful agent is destined to revolutionize the condition of\r\nthe world. It becomes the United States, therefore, looking to their\r\nsecurity, to adopt a similar policy, and the plan suggested will enable\r\nthem to do so at a small comparative cost.\r\n\r\nI take the greatest pleasure in bearing testimony to the zeal and\r\nuntiring industry which has characterized the conduct of the members of\r\nthe Executive Cabinet. Each in his appropriate sphere has rendered me\r\nthe most efficient aid in carrying on the Government, and it will not,\r\nI trust, appear out of place for me to bear this public testimony. The\r\ncardinal objects which should ever be held in view by those intrusted\r\nwith the administration of public affairs are rigidly, and without favor\r\nor affection, so to interpret the national will expressed in the laws as\r\nthat injustice should be done to none, justice to all. This has been the\r\nrule upon which they have acted, and thus it is believed that few cases,\r\nif any, exist wherein our fellow-citizens, who from time to time have\r\nbeen drawn to the seat of Government for the settlement of their\r\ntransactions with the Government, have gone away dissatisfied. Where the\r\ntestimony has been perfected and was esteemed satisfactory their claims\r\nhave been promptly audited, and this in the absence of all favoritism or\r\npartiality. The Government which is not just to its own people can\r\nneither claim their affection nor the respect of the world. At the same\r\ntime, the closest attention has been paid to those matters which relate\r\nmore immediately to the great concerns of the country. Order and\r\nefficiency in each branch of the public service have prevailed,\r\naccompanied by a system of the most rigid responsibility on the part of\r\nthe receiving and disbursing agents. The fact, in illustration of the\r\ntruth of this remark, deserves to be noticed that the revenues of the\r\nGovernment, amounting in the last four years to upward of $120,000,000,\r\nhave been collected and disbursed through the numerous governmental\r\nagents without the loss by default of any amount worthy of serious\r\ncommentary.\r\n\r\nThe appropriations made by Congress for the improvement of the rivers of\r\nthe West and of the harbors on the Lakes are in a course of judicious\r\nexpenditure under suitable agents, and are destined, it is to be hoped,\r\nto realize all the benefits designed to be accomplished by Congress.\r\nI can not, however, sufficiently impress upon Congress the great\r\nimportance of withholding appropriations from improvements which are not\r\nascertained by previous examination and survey to be necessary for the\r\nshelter and protection of trade from the dangers of storms and tempests.\r\nWithout this precaution the expenditures are but too apt to inure to the\r\nbenefit of individuals, without reference to the only consideration\r\nwhich can render them constitutional--the public interests and the\r\ngeneral good.\r\n\r\nI can not too earnestly urge upon you the interests of this District,\r\nover which by the Constitution Congress has exclusive jurisdiction. It\r\nwould be deeply to be regretted should there be at any time ground to\r\ncomplain of neglect on the part of a community which, detached as it is\r\nfrom the parental care of the States of Virginia and Maryland, can only\r\nexpect aid from Congress as its local legislature. Amongst the subjects\r\nwhich claim your attention is the prompt organization of an asylum for\r\nthe insane who may be found from time to time sojourning within the\r\nDistrict. Such course is also demanded by considerations which apply to\r\nbranches of the public service. For the necessities in this behalf I\r\ninvite your particular attention to the report of the Secretary of the\r\nNavy.\r\n\r\nI have thus, gentlemen of the two Houses of Congress, presented you\r\na true and faithful picture of the condition of public affairs, both\r\nforeign and domestic. The wants of the public service are made known\r\nto you, and matters of no ordinary importance are urged upon your\r\nconsideration. Shall I not be permitted to congratulate you on the happy\r\nauspices under which you have assembled and at the important change in\r\nthe condition of things which has occurred in the last three years?\r\nDuring that period questions with foreign powers of vital importance to\r\nthe peace of our country have been settled and adjusted. A desolating\r\nand wasting war with savage tribes has been brought to a close. The\r\ninternal tranquillity of the country, threatened by agitating questions,\r\nhas been preserved. The credit of the Government, which had experienced\r\na temporary embarrassment, has been thoroughly restored. Its coffers,\r\nwhich for a season were empty, have been replenished. A currency nearly\r\nuniform in its value has taken the place of one depreciated and almost\r\nworthless. Commerce and manufactures, which had suffered in common with\r\nevery other interest, have once more revived, and the whole country\r\nexhibits an aspect of prosperity and happiness. Trade and barter, no\r\nlonger governed by a wild and speculative mania, rest upon a solid\r\nand substantial footing, and the rapid growth of our cities in every\r\ndirection bespeaks most strongly the favorable circumstances by which we\r\nare surrounded. My happiness in the retirement which shortly awaits me\r\nis the ardent hope which I experience that this state of prosperity is\r\nneither deceptive nor destined to be short lived, and that measures\r\nwhich have not yet received its sanction, but which I can not but regard\r\nas closely connected with the honor, the glory, and still more enlarged\r\nprosperity of the country, are destined at an early day to receive\r\nthe approval of Congress. Under these circumstances and with these\r\nanticipations I shall most gladly leave to others more able than myself\r\nthe noble and pleasing task of sustaining the public prosperity. I shall\r\ncarry with me into retirement the gratifying reflection that as my sole\r\nobject throughout has been to advance the public good I may not entirely\r\nhave failed in accomplishing it; and this gratification is heightened in\r\nno small degree by the fact that when under a deep and abiding sense of\r\nduty I have found myself constrained to resort to the qualified veto it\r\nhas neither been followed by disapproval on the part of the people nor\r\nweakened in any degree their attachment to that great conservative\r\nfeature of our Government.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 10, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have great pleasure in submitting to the Senate, for its ratification\r\nand approval, a treaty which has been concluded between Mr. Cushing, the\r\nUnited States commissioner, and the Chinese Empire.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 10, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI submit copies of two private and confidential letters addressed by Mr.\r\nFay, acting in his place during the absence of Mr. Wheaton from Berlin,\r\nfrom which it appears that should the Senate see cause to ratify the\r\ntreaty with the States composing the Zollverein without reference to the\r\nfact that the time limited for the exchange of its ratification had\r\nexpired the Germanic States would regard the time fixed for the exchange\r\nof ratifications as immaterial and would give by their action upon\r\nit vitality and force to the treaty. I submit it to your mature\r\nconsideration whether, in view of the important benefits arising from\r\nthe treaty to the trade and commerce of the United States and to their\r\nagriculture, it would not comport with sound policy to adopt that\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThe Executive, not regarding the action of the Senate upon the treaty\r\nas expressive of its decisive opinion, deemed it proper to reopen\r\nthe negotiations so far as to obtain an extension of time for the\r\ninterchange of ratifications. The negotiation failed, however, in this\r\nparticular, out of no disinclination to abide by the terms of the treaty\r\non the part of the Zollverein, but from a belief that it would not fully\r\ncomport with its dignity to do so.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 10, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to you an extract of a dispatch from Mr. Hall to the\r\nSecretary of State, which has been received by me since my message of\r\nthe 3d instant, containing the pleasing intelligence that the indemnity\r\nassumed to be paid by the Republic of Venezuela in the case of the brig\r\n_Morris_ has been satisfactorily arranged.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 18, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith copies of dispatches received from our minister at\r\nMexico since the commencement of your present session, which claim from\r\ntheir importance, and I doubt not will receive, your calm and deliberate\r\nconsideration. The extraordinary and highly offensive language which\r\nthe Mexican Government has thought proper to employ in reply to the\r\nremonstrance of the Executive, through Mr. Shannon, against the renewal\r\nof the war with Texas while the question of annexation was pending\r\nbefore Congress and the people, and also the proposed manner of\r\nconducting that war, will not fail to arrest your attention. Such\r\nremonstrance, urged in no unfriendly spirit to Mexico, was called for by\r\nconsiderations of an imperative character, having relation as well to\r\nthe peace of this country and honor of this Government as to the cause\r\nof humanity and civilization. Texas had entered into the treaty of\r\nannexation upon the invitation of the Executive, and when for that act\r\nshe was threatened with a renewal of the war on the part of Mexico she\r\nnaturally looked to this Government to interpose its efforts to ward\r\noff the threatened blow. But one course was left the Executive, acting\r\nwithin the limits of its constitutional competency, and that was to\r\nprotest in respectful, but at the same time strong and decided, terms\r\nagainst it. The war thus threatened to be renewed was promulgated by\r\nedicts and decrees, which ordered on the part of the Mexican military\r\nthe desolation of whole tracts of country and the destruction without\r\ndiscrimination of all ages, sexes, and conditions of existence. Over the\r\nmanner of conducting war Mexico possesses no exclusive control. She has\r\nno right to violate at pleasure the principles which an enlightened\r\ncivilization has laid down for the conduct of nations at war, and\r\nthereby retrograde to a period of barbarism, which happily for the world\r\nhas long since passed away. All nations are interested in enforcing an\r\nobservance of those principles, and the United States, the oldest of\r\nthe American Republics and the nearest of the civilized powers to the\r\ntheater on which these enormities were proposed to be enacted, could not\r\nquietly content themselves to witness such a state of things. They had\r\nthrough the Executive on another occasion, and, as was believed, with\r\nthe approbation of the whole country, remonstrated against outrages\r\nsimilar but even less inhuman than those which by her new edicts and\r\ndecrees she has threatened to perpetrate, and of which the late inhuman\r\nmassacre at Tabasco was but the precursor.\r\n\r\nThe bloody and inhuman murder of Fannin and his companions, equaled only\r\nin savage barbarity by the usages of the untutored Indian tribes, proved\r\nhow little confidence could be placed on the most solemn stipulations of\r\nher generals, while the fate of others who became her captives in\r\nwar--many of whom, no longer able to sustain the fatigues and privations\r\nof long journeys, were shot down by the wayside, while their companions\r\nwho survived were subjected to sufferings even more painful than\r\ndeath--had left an indelible stain on the page of civilization. The\r\nExecutive, with the evidence of an intention on the part of Mexico to\r\nrenew scenes so revolting to humanity, could do no less than renew\r\nremonstrances formerly urged. For fulfilling duties so imperative Mexico\r\nhas thought proper, through her accredited organs, because she has had\r\nrepresented to her the inhumanity of such proceedings, to indulge in\r\nlanguage unknown to the courtesy of diplomatic intercourse and offensive\r\nin the highest degree to this Government and people. Nor has she\r\noffended in this only. She has not only violated existing conventions\r\nbetween the two countries by arbitrary and unjust decrees against our\r\ntrade and intercourse, but withholds installments of debt due to our\r\ncitizens which she solemnly pledged herself to pay under circumstances\r\nwhich are fully explained by the accompanying letter from Mr. Green, our\r\nsecretary of legation. And when our minister has invited the attention\r\nof her Government to wrongs committed by her local authorities, not only\r\non the property but on the persons of our fellow-citizens engaged in\r\nprosecuting fair and honest pursuits, she has added insult to injury\r\nby not even deigning for months together to return an answer to his\r\nrepresentations. Still further to manifest her unfriendly feelings\r\ntoward the United States, she has issued decrees expelling from some\r\nof her Provinces American citizens engaged in the peaceful pursuits of\r\nlife, and now denies to those of our citizens prosecuting the whale\r\nfishery on the northwest coast of the Pacific the privilege, which has\r\nthrough all time heretofore been accorded to them, of exchanging goods\r\nof a small amount in value at her ports in California for supplies\r\nindispensable to their health and comfort.\r\n\r\nNor will it escape the observation of Congress that in conducting a\r\ncorrespondence with a minister of the United States, who can not and\r\ndoes not know any distinction between the geographical sections of the\r\nUnion, charges wholly unfounded are made against particular States, and\r\nan appeal to others for aid and protection against supposed wrongs. In\r\nthis same connection, sectional prejudices are attempted to be excited\r\nand the hazardous and unpardonable effort is made to foment divisions\r\namongst the States of the Union and thereby imbitter their peace. Mexico\r\nhas still to learn that however freely we may indulge in discussion\r\namong ourselves, the American people will tolerate no interference in\r\ntheir domestic affairs by any foreign government, and in all that\r\nconcerns the constitutional guaranties and the national honor the people\r\nof the United States have but one mind and one heart.\r\n\r\nThe subject of annexation addresses itself, most fortunately, to every\r\nportion of the Union. The Executive would have been unmindful of its\r\nhighest obligations if it could have adopted a course of policy dictated\r\nby sectional interests and local feelings. On the contrary, it was\r\nbecause the question was neither local nor sectional, but made its\r\nappeal to the interests of the whole Union, and of every State in the\r\nUnion, that the negotiation, and finally the treaty of annexation, was\r\nentered into; and it has afforded me no ordinary pleasure to perceive\r\nthat so far as demonstrations have been made upon it by the people they\r\nhave proceeded from all portions of the Union. Mexico may seek to excite\r\ndivisions amongst us by uttering unjust denunciations against particular\r\nStates, but when she comes to know that the invitations addressed to our\r\nfellow-citizens by Spain, and afterwards by herself, to settle Texas\r\nwere accepted by emigrants from all the States, and when, in addition to\r\nthis, she refreshes her recollection with the fact that the first effort\r\nwhich was made to acquire Texas was during the Administration of a\r\ndistinguished citizen from an Eastern State, which was afterwards\r\nrenewed under the auspices of a President from the Southwest, she will\r\nawake to a knowledge of the futility of her present purpose of sowing\r\ndissensions among us or producing distraction in our councils by attacks\r\neither on particular States or on persons who are now in the retirement\r\nof private life.\r\n\r\nConsidering the appeal which she now makes to eminent citizens by name,\r\ncan she hope to escape censure for having ascribed to them, as well as\r\nto others, a design, as she pretends now for the first time revealed, of\r\nhaving originated negotiations to despoil her by duplicity and falsehood\r\nof a portion of her territory? The opinion then, as now, prevailed with\r\nthe Executive that the annexation of Texas to the Union was a matter\r\nof vast importance. In order to acquire that territory before it\r\nhad assumed a position among the independent powers of the earth,\r\npropositions were made to Mexico for a cession of it to the United\r\nStates. Mexico saw in these proceedings at the time no cause of\r\ncomplaint. She is now, when simply reminded of them, awakened to the\r\nknowledge of the fact, which she, through her secretary of state,\r\npromulgates to the whole world as true, that those negotiations were\r\nfounded in deception and falsehood and superinduced by unjust and\r\niniquitous motives. While Texas was a dependency of Mexico the United\r\nStates opened negotiations with the latter power for the cession of her\r\nthen acknowledged territory, and now that Texas is independent of Mexico\r\nand has maintained a separate existence for nine years, during which\r\ntime she has been received into the family of nations and is represented\r\nby accredited ambassadors at many of the principal Courts of Europe, and\r\nwhen it has become obvious to the whole world that she is forever lost\r\nto Mexico, the United States is charged with deception and falsehood in\r\nall relating to the past, and condemnatory accusations are made against\r\nStates which have had no special agency in the matter, because the\r\nExecutive of the whole Union has negotiated with free and independent\r\nTexas upon a matter vitally important to the interests of both\r\ncountries; and after nine years of unavailing war Mexico now announces\r\nher intention, through her secretary of foreign affairs, never to\r\nconsent to the independence of Texas or to abandon the effort to\r\nreconquer that Republic. She thus announces a perpetual claim, which\r\nat the end of a century will furnish her as plausible a ground for\r\ndiscontent against any nation which at the end of that time may enter\r\ninto a treaty with Texas as she possesses at this moment against the\r\nUnited States. The lapse of time can add nothing to her title to\r\nindependence. A course of conduct such as has been described on the part\r\nof Mexico, in violation of all friendly feeling and of the courtesy\r\nwhich should characterize the intercourse between the nations of the\r\nearth, might well justify the United States in a resort to any measures\r\nto vindicate their national honor; but, actuated by a sincere desire\r\nto preserve the general peace, and in view of the present condition\r\nof Mexico, the Executive, resting upon its integrity, and not fearing\r\nbut that the judgment of the world will duly appreciate its motives,\r\nabstains from recommending to Congress a resort to measures of redress\r\nand contents itself with reurging upon that body prompt and immediate\r\naction on the subject of annexation. By adopting that measure the United\r\nStates will be in the exercise of an undoubted right; and if Mexico,\r\nnot regarding their forbearance, shall aggravate the injustice of her\r\nconduct by a declaration of war against them, upon her head will rest\r\nall the responsibility.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 23, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe messenger who lately bore to Berlin the ratified copy of the\r\nconvention for the mutual abolition of the _droit d'aubaine_ and taxes\r\non emigration between the United States of America and the Grand Duchy\r\nof Hesse, has just returned to Washington, bearing with him the exchange\r\ncopy of said convention. It appears that the exchange of ratifications\r\ndid not take place until the 16th day of October, twenty days after\r\nthe period fixed by the convention itself for that purpose. This\r\ninformality, which it would seem was occasioned by the absence from\r\nBerlin of the plenipotentiary from Hesse and by the time necessarily\r\nrequired for the preparation of the document, has been waived by the\r\nrepresentative of that Government.\r\n\r\nThis subject is now submitted for the consideration of the Senate.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 23, 1844_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit a letter from the Secretary of State, accompanied by\r\ncopies of the correspondence[136] asked for by your resolution of the\r\n12th instant.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: Extracts from the instructions of the Department of State\r\nto the United States minister to France relative to the proposed\r\nannexation of Texas, etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 2, 1845_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a letter from the Secretary of State, accompanied\r\nby a copy of a letter[137] from Mr. Raymond, secretary of legation and\r\nchargé d'affaires _ad interim_ of the Republic of Texas, in answer to\r\nthe Senate's resolution of the 16th December last.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: Relating to the public debt and public lands of the\r\nRepublic of Texas.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 2, 1845_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to your resolution of the 19th December last, I herewith\r\ntransmit a letter[138] from the Secretary of State and the accompanying\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: Transmitting copies of treaties between the Republic of\r\nTexas and Great Britain and France.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 9, 1845_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives, in reply to their\r\nresolution of the 14th of June last, a report from the Secretary of State,\r\nwith accompanying papers.[139]\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: Copy of the instructions to George W. Erving upon his\r\nappointment as minister to Spain in 1814 and during his mission to\r\nthat Court.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 9, 1845_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith additional documents having relation to the treaty\r\nwith China, which may enable the Senate more satisfactorily to act upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 22, 1845_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith an abstract of the treaty between the United\r\nStates of America and the Chinese Empire concluded at Wang-Hiya on the\r\n3d of July last, and ratified by the Senate on the 16th instant, and\r\nwhich, having also been ratified by the Emperor of China, now awaits\r\nonly the exchange of the ratifications in China, from which it will be\r\nseen that the special mission authorized by Congress for this purpose\r\nhas fully succeeded in the accomplishment so far of the great objects\r\nfor which it was appointed, and in placing our relations with China on a\r\nnew footing eminently favorable to the commerce and other interests of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nIn view of the magnitude and importance of our national concerns, actual\r\nand prospective, in China, I submit to the consideration of Congress\r\nthe expediency of providing for the preservation and cultivation of the\r\nsubsisting relations of amity between the United States and the Chinese\r\nGovernment, either by means of a permanent minister or commissioner\r\nwith diplomatic functions, as in the case of certain of the Mohammedan\r\nStates. It appears by one of the extracts annexed that the establishment\r\nof the British Government in China consists both of a plenipotentiary\r\nand also of paid consuls for all the five ports, one of whom has the\r\ntitle and exercises the functions of consul-general; and France has also\r\na salaried consul-general, and the interests of the United States seem\r\nin like manner to call for some representative in China of a higher\r\nclass than an ordinary commercial consulate.\r\n\r\nI also submit to the consideration of Congress the expediency of making\r\nsome special provision by law for the security of the independent and\r\nhonorable position which the treaty of Wang-Hiya confers on citizens\r\nof the United States residing or doing business in China. By the\r\ntwenty-first and twenty-fifth articles of the treaty (copies of which\r\nare subjoined _in extenso_) citizens of the United States in China are\r\nwholly exempted, as well in criminal as in civil matters, from the local\r\njurisdiction of the Chinese Government and made amenable to the laws and\r\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the appropriate authorities of the United\r\nStates alone. Some action on the part of Congress seems desirable in\r\norder to give full effect to these important concessions of the Chinese\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 29, 1845_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the request of the governor of the State of Illinois,\r\nI transmit herewith a copy of certain resolutions[140] adopted by the\r\ngeneral assembly of that State.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: Asking the publication and distribution of the decisions\r\nof the Supreme Court of the United States.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 3, 1845_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 2d ultimo, calling\r\nfor information in reference to the indemnities stipulated to be paid\r\npursuant to the convention between the United States and the Mexican\r\nRepublic of the 30th of January, 1843, I transmit herewith reports from\r\nthe Secretaries of State and of the Treasury and the documents which\r\naccompanied them.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 3, 1845_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 23d\r\nultimo, requesting information upon the subject of embezzlement of\r\npublic money, I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 3, 1845_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 16th\r\nultimo, calling for information upon the subject of the boundaries, of\r\nthe Republic of Texas and for copies of treaties between that Republic\r\nand other powers, I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of\r\nState and the documents which accompanied it.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 4, 1845_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 5th December,\r\nI herewith transmit copies of the proceedings in the case of the\r\ninquiry into the official conduct of Silas Reed, principal surveyor\r\nof Missouri and Illinois, together with all the complaints against\r\nhim and all the evidence taken in relation thereto. I did not consider\r\nthe irregularities into which the surveyor-general had fallen as of\r\nsufficient magnitude to induce his dismissal from office at the time\r\nthat the papers reached me, having become convinced, upon inquiry of the\r\nCommissioner of the General Land Office, of the ability, efficiency,\r\nand fidelity of the surveyor-general in all things appertaining to his\r\noffice; but since the passage of the resolution by the Senate I regarded\r\nthe matter as so augmented in importance as to induce me to refer the\r\nsubject to the Commissioner of the General Land Office for a minute and\r\nthorough examination. A copy of the report which he has made, and also\r\nthe defense of Dr. Reed, accompanies the papers. It has seemed to me\r\nthat the facts set forth by the report exhibit certain irregularities\r\nwhich are properly reprehensible, but from which neither the\r\nsurveyor-general, in a pecuniary point of view, derived profit nor\r\nthe Government sustained loss, and which the reproof contained in the\r\nCommissioner's report will in all future cases restrain; while the\r\nhigh testimony borne by the Commissioner to the generally excellent\r\ndeportment in office of the surveyor-general has seemed to me to mark\r\nthe case more as one meriting disapproval and correction in future than\r\nthe severe punishment of dismissal.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 5, 1845_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives, in answer to its\r\nresolution of the 31st ultimo, a report from the Secretary of State,\r\ntogether with copies of documents[141] therein referred to.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 141: Correspondence relative to the surrender by Great Britain\r\nof fugitive criminals from Florida under the treaty of Washington.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 5, 1845_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 10th of December\r\nlast, requesting further correspondence touching the relations between\r\nthe United States and the Mexican Republic, I transmit herewith a report\r\nfrom the Secretary of State and the documents which accompanied it.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 7, 1845_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the report[142] requested by the resolution of the\r\nSenate of the 2d of January last.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 142: Of Lieutenant H.

engaged in the fisheries, under a pretended infraction of the\r\nconvention of October 20, 1818.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 20, 1845_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the information of Congress, copies of certain\r\ndispatches recently received from Mr. Wise, our envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary at the Court of Brazil, upon the subject of the\r\nslave trade, developing the means used and the devices resorted to in\r\norder to evade existing enactments upon that subject.\r\n\r\nAnxiously desirous as are the United States to suppress a traffic so\r\nrevolting to humanity, in the efforts to accomplish which they have been\r\nthe pioneers of civilized states, it can not but be a subject of the\r\nmost profound regret that any portion of our citizens should be found\r\nacting in cooperation with the subjects of other powers in opposition to\r\nthe policy of their own Government, thereby subjecting to suspicion and\r\nto the hazard of disgrace the flag of their own country. It is true that\r\nthis traffic is carried on altogether in foreign parts and that our own\r\ncoasts are free from its pollution; but the crime remains the same\r\nwherever perpetrated, and there are many circumstances to warrant the\r\nbelief that some of our citizens are deeply involved in its guilt. The\r\nmode and manner of carrying on this trade are clearly and fearlessly set\r\nforth in the accompanying documents, and it would seem that a regular\r\nsystem has been adopted for the purpose of thwarting the policy and\r\nevading the penalties of our laws. American vessels, with the knowledge,\r\nas there are good reasons to believe, of the owners and masters, are\r\n_chartered_, or rather purchased, by notorious slave dealers in Brazil,\r\naided by English brokers and capitalists, with this intent. The vessel\r\nis only nominally chartered at so much per month, while in truth it is\r\nactually sold, to be delivered on the coast of Africa; the charter party\r\nbinding the owners in the meantime to take on board _as passengers_ a\r\nnew crew in Brazil, who, when delivered on the coast, are to navigate\r\nher back to the ports of Brazil with her cargo of slaves. Under this\r\nagreement the vessel clears from the United States for some port in\r\nGreat Britain, where a cargo of merchandise known as \"coast goods,\" and\r\ndesigned especially for the African trade, is purchased, shipped, and\r\nconsigned, together with the vessel, either directly to the slave dealer\r\nhimself or to his agents or accomplices in Brazil. On her arrival a new\r\ncrew is put on board _as passengers_ and the vessel and cargo consigned\r\nto an equally guilty factor or agent on the coast of Africa, where\r\nthe unlawful purpose originally designed is finally consummated. The\r\nmerchandise is exchanged for slaves, the vessel is delivered up, her\r\nname obliterated, her papers destroyed, her American crew discharged, to\r\nbe provided for by the charterers, and the new or _passenger_ crew put\r\nin command to carry back its miserable freight to the first contrivers\r\nof the voyage, or their _employees_ in Brazil.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole progress of this tortuous enterprise it is possible\r\nthat neither the American crew originally enlisted nor the _passenger_\r\ncrew put on board in the Brazilian ports are aware of the nature\r\nof the voyage, and yet it is on these principally, ignorant if not\r\ninnocent, that the penalties of the law are inflicted, while the guilty\r\ncontrivers--the charterers, brokers, owners, and masters; in short, all\r\nwho are most deeply concerned in the crime and its rewards--for the most\r\npart escape unpunished.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the examinations which have recently taken place\r\nat Rio that the subjects of Her Britannic Majesty as well as our own\r\ncitizens are deeply implicated in this inhuman traffic. British factors\r\nand agents, while they supply Africa with British fabrics in exchange\r\nfor slaves, are chiefly instrumental in the abuse of the American flag;\r\nand the suggestions contained in the letter of Mr. Wise (whose judicious\r\nand zealous efforts in the matter can not be too highly commended),\r\naddressed to Mr. Hamilton, the British envoy, as to the best mode of\r\nsuppressing the evil, deserve your most deliberate consideration, as\r\nthey will receive, I doubt not, that of the British Government.\r\n\r\nIt is also worthy of consideration whether any other measures than those\r\nnow existing are necessary to give greater efficacy to the just and\r\nhumane policy of our laws, which already provide for the restoration to\r\nAfrica of slaves captured at sea by American cruisers. From time to time\r\nprovision has been made by this Government for their comfortable support\r\nand maintenance during a limited period after their restoration, and it\r\nis much to be regretted that this liberal policy has not been adopted by\r\nGreat Britain. As it is, it seems to me that the policy it has adopted\r\nis calculated rather to perpetuate than to suppress the trade by\r\nenlisting very large interests in its favor. Merchants and capitalists\r\nfurnish the means of carrying it on; manufactures, for which the negroes\r\nare exchanged, are the products of her workshops; the slaves, when\r\ncaptured, instead of being returned back to their homes are transferred\r\nto her colonial possessions in the West Indies and made the means of\r\nswelling the amount of their products by a system of apprenticeship for\r\na term of years; and the officers and crews who capture the vessels\r\nreceive on the whole number of slaves so many pounds sterling _per\r\ncapita_ by way of bounty.\r\n\r\nIt must be obvious that while these large interests are enlisted in\r\nfavor of its continuance it will be difficult, if not impossible, to\r\nsuppress the nefarious traffic, and that its results would be in effect\r\nbut a continuance of the slave trade in another and more cruel form; for\r\nit can be but a matter of little difference to the African whether he is\r\ntorn from his country and transported to the West Indies as a slave in\r\nthe regular course of the trade, or captured by a cruiser, transferred\r\nto the same place, and made to perform the same labor under the name of\r\nan apprentice, which is at present the practical operation of the policy\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that Her Britannic Majesty's Government will, upon a\r\nreview of all the circumstances stated in these dispatches, adopt more\r\nefficient measures for the suppression of the trade, which she has so\r\nlong attempted to put down, with, as yet, so little success, and more\r\nconsonant with the original policy of restoring the captured African to\r\nhis home.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 21, 1845_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a treaty of peace, friendship, navigation, and commerce\r\nbetween the United States and the Republic of New Granada, signed at\r\nBogota on the 20th of December last.

The models have been furnished by the Navy\r\nDepartment and side wheels have been ordered, as being best tested and\r\nleast liable to failure. The one boat is directed to be built at\r\nRichmond, Va., the other at Pittsburg, Pa., and contracts have been\r\nregularly entered into for their construction. The contractors have made\r\nand are making all necessary arrangements in procuring materials and\r\nsites for building, etc., and have doubtless been at considerable\r\nexpense in the necessary preparations for completing their engagements.\r\nIt was no part of the intention of the Senate in originating the bill,\r\nI am well convinced, to violate the sanctity of contracts regularly\r\nentered into by the Government. The language of the act, nevertheless,\r\nis of a character to produce in all probability that effect. Its\r\nlanguage is \"that no revenue cutter or revenue steamer shall hereafter\r\nbe built _(excepting such as are now in the course of building or\r\nequipment_) nor purchased unless an appropriation be first made by law\r\ntherefor.\" The _building_ of the two cutters under contract can not be\r\nsaid properly to have commenced, although preparations have been made\r\nfor building; but even if the construction be ambiguous, it is better\r\nthat all ambiguity should be removed and thus the hazard of violating\r\nthe pledged faith of the country be removed along with it.\r\n\r\nI am free to confess that, existing contracts being guarded and\r\nprotected, the law to operate _in futuro_ would be regarded as both\r\nproper and wise.\r\n\r\nWith these objections, I return the bill to the House in which it\r\noriginated for its final constitutional action.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n[From Senate Journal, Twenty-eighth Congress, second session, p. 271.]\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 8, 1845_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senators of the United States, respectively_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR: Objects interesting to the United States requiring that the Senate\r\nshould be in session on Tuesday, the 4th of March next, to receive and\r\nact upon such communications as may be made to it on the part of the\r\nExecutive, your attendance in the Senate Chamber, in this city, on that\r\nday at 10 o'clock in the forenoon is accordingly requested.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER.",
