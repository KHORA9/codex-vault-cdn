(1880)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Il y a bien du factice dans le classement politique des hommes.\r\n                                                    —GUIZOT.\r\n\r\n    There is plenty of what is purely artificial in the political\r\n    classification of men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 20, after eight-and-forty years of strenuous public life, Mr.\r\nGladstone met his twelfth parliament, and the second in which he had been\r\nchief minister of the crown. “At 4.15,” he records, “I went down to the\r\nHouse with Herbert. There was a great and fervent crowd in Palace Yard,\r\nand much feeling in the House. It almost overpowered me, as I thought by\r\nwhat deep and hidden agencies I have been brought back into the midst of\r\nthe vortex of political action and contention. It has not been in my power\r\nduring these last six months to have made notes, as I would have wished,\r\nof my own thoughts and observations from time to time; of the new access\r\nof strength which in some important respects has been administered to me\r\nin my old age; and of the remarkable manner in which Holy Scripture has\r\nbeen applied to me for admonition and for comfort. Looking calmly on this\r\ncourse of experience, I do believe that the Almighty has employed me for\r\nHis purposes in a manner larger or more special than before, and has\r\nstrengthened me and led me on accordingly, though I must not forget the\r\nadmirable saying of Hooker, that even ministers of good things are like\r\ntorches, a light to others, waste and destruction to themselves.”\r\n\r\nOne who approached his task in such a spirit as this was at least\r\nimpregnable to ordinary mortifications, and it was well; for before many\r\ndays were over it became perceptible that the new parliament and the new\r\nmajority would be no docile instrument of ministerial will. An acute chill\r\nfollowed the discovery that there was to be no recall of Frere or Layard.\r\nVery early in its history Speaker Brand, surveying his flock from the\r\naugust altitude of the Chair with an acute, experienced, and friendly eye,\r\nmade up his mind that the liberal party were “not only strong, but\r\ndetermined to have their own way in spite of Mr. Gladstone. He has a\r\ndifficult team to drive.” Two men of striking character on the benches\r\nopposite quickly became formidable. Lord Randolph Churchill headed a\r\nlittle group of four tories, and Mr. Parnell a resolute band of five and\r\nthirty Irishmen, with momentous results both for ministers and for the\r\nHouse of Commons.\r\n\r\nNo more capable set of ruling men were ever got together than the cabinet\r\nof 1880; no men who better represented the leading elements in the\r\ncountry, in all their variety and strength. The great possessors of land\r\nwere there, and the heirs of long governing tradition were there; the\r\nindustrious and the sedate of the middle classes found their men seated at\r\nthe council board, by the side of others whose keen-sighted ambition\r\nsought sources of power in the ranks of manual toil; the church saw one of\r\nthe most ardent of her sons upon the woolsack, and the most illustrious of\r\nthem in the highest place of all; the people of the chapel beheld with\r\ncomplacency the rising man of the future in one who publicly boasted an\r\nunbroken line of nonconformist descent. They were all men well trained in\r\nthe habits of business, of large affairs, and in experience of English\r\nlife; they were all in spite of difference of shade genuinely liberal; and\r\nthey all professed a devoted loyalty to their chief. The incident of the\r\nresolutions on the eastern question(1) was effaced from all (M1) memories,\r\nand men who in those days had assured themselves that there was no return\r\nfrom Elba, became faithful marshals of the conquering hero. Mediocrity in\r\na long-lived cabinet in the earlier part of the century was the object of\r\nDisraeli’s keenest mockery. Still a slight ballast of mediocrity in a\r\ngovernment steadies the ship and makes for unity—a truth, by the way, that\r\nMr. Disraeli himself, in forming governments, sometimes conspicuously put\r\nin practice.\r\n\r\nIn fact Mr. Gladstone found that the ministry of which he stood at the\r\nhead was a coalition, and what was more, a coalition of that vexatious\r\nkind, where those who happened not to agree sometimes seemed to be almost\r\nas well pleased with contention as with harmony. The two sections were not\r\nalways divided by differences of class or station, for some of the peers\r\nin the cabinet often showed as bold a liberalism as any of the commoners.\r\nThis notwithstanding, it happened on more than one critical occasion, that\r\nall the peers _plus_ Lord Hartington were on one side, and all the\r\ncommoners on the other. Lord Hartington was in many respects the lineal\r\nsuccessor of Palmerston in his coolness on parliamentary reform, in his\r\ninclination to stand in the old ways, in his extreme suspicion of what\r\nsavoured of sentiment or idealism or high-flown profession. But he was a\r\nPalmerston who respected Mr. Gladstone, and desired to work faithfully\r\nunder him, instead of being a Palmerston who always intended to keep the\r\nupper hand of him. Confronting Lord Hartington was Mr. Chamberlain, eager,\r\nintrepid, self-reliant, alert, daring, with notions about property,\r\ntaxation, land, schools, popular rights, that he expressed with a\r\nplainness and pungency of speech that had never been heard from a privy\r\ncouncillor and cabinet minister before, that exasperated opponents,\r\nstartled the whigs, and brought him hosts of adherents among radicals out\r\nof doors. It was at a very early stage in the existence of the government,\r\nthat this important man said to an ally in the cabinet, “I don’t see how\r\nwe are to get on, if Mr. Gladstone goes.” And here was the key to many\r\nleading incidents, both during the life of this administration and for the\r\neventful year in Mr. Gladstone’s career that followed its demise.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Argyll, who resigned very early, wrote to Mr. Gladstone after\r\nthe government was overthrown (Dec. 18, 1885), urging him in effect to\r\nside definitely with the whigs against the radicals:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    From the moment our government was fairly under way, I saw and\r\n    felt that speeches _outside_ were allowed to affect opinion, and\r\n    politically to commit the cabinet in a direction which was not\r\n    determined by you deliberately, or by the government as a whole,\r\n    but by the audacity ... of our new associates. Month by month I\r\n    became more and more uncomfortable, feeling that there was no\r\n    paramount direction—nothing but _slip_ and _slide_, what the\r\n    Scotch call “slithering.” The outside world, knowing your great\r\n    gifts and powers, assume that you are dictator in your own\r\n    cabinet. And in one sense you are so, that is to say, that when\r\n    you choose to put your foot down, others will give way. But your\r\n    amiability to colleagues, your even extreme gentleness towards\r\n    them, whilst it has always endeared you to them personally, has\r\n    enabled men playing their own game ... to take out of your hands\r\n    the _formation_ of opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a connected aspect of the same thing, Mr. Gladstone wrote to Lord\r\nRosebery (Sept. 16, 1880):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    ... All this is too long to bore people with—and yet it is not so\r\n    long, nor so interesting, as one at least of the subjects which we\r\n    just touched in conversation at Mentmore; the future of politics,\r\n    and the food they offer to the mind. What is outside parliament\r\n    seems to me to be fast mounting, nay to have already mounted, to\r\n    an importance much exceeding what is inside. Parliament deals with\r\n    laws, and branches of the social tree, not with the root. I always\r\n    admired Mrs. Grote’s saying that politics and theology were the\r\n    only two really great subjects; it was wonderful considering the\r\n    atmosphere in which she had lived. I do not doubt which of the two\r\n    she would have put in the first place; and to theology I have no\r\n    doubt she would have given a wide sense, as including everything\r\n    that touches the relation between the seen and the unseen.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is curious to note is that, though Mr. Gladstone in making his\r\ncabinet had thrown the main weight against (M2) the radicals, yet when\r\nthey got to work, it was with them he found himself more often than not in\r\nenergetic agreement. In common talk and in partisan speeches, the prime\r\nminister was regarded as dictatorial and imperious. The complaint of some\r\nat least among his colleagues in the cabinet of 1880 was rather that he\r\nwas not imperious enough. Almost from the first he too frequently allowed\r\nhimself to be over-ruled; often in secondary matters, it is true, but\r\nsometimes also in matters on the uncertain frontier between secondary and\r\nprimary. Then he adopted a practice of taking votes and counting numbers,\r\nof which more than one old hand complained as an innovation. Lord\r\nGranville said to him in 1886, “I think you too often counted noses in\r\nyour last cabinet.”\r\n\r\nWhat Mr. Gladstone described as the severest fight that he had ever known\r\nin any cabinet occurred in 1883, upon the removal of the Duke of\r\nWellington’s statue from Hyde Park Corner. A vote took place, and three\r\ntimes over he took down the names. He was against removal, but was unable\r\nto have his own way over the majority. Members of the government thought\r\nthemselves curiously free to walk out from divisions. On a Transvaal\r\ndivision two members of the cabinet abstained, and so did two other\r\nministers out of the cabinet. In other cases, the same thing happened, not\r\nonly breaking discipline, but breeding much trouble with the Queen. Then\r\nan unusual number of men of ability and of a degree of self-esteem not\r\nbelow their ability, had been left out of the inner circle; and they and\r\ntheir backers were sometimes apt to bring their pretensions rather\r\nfretfully forward. These were the things that to Mr. Gladstone’s\r\ntemperament proved more harassing than graver concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nAll through the first two months of its business, the House showed signs\r\nof independence that almost broke the spirit of the ministerial whips. A\r\nbill about hares and rabbits produced lively excitement, ministerialists\r\nmoved amendments upon the measure of their own leaders, and the minister\r\nin charge boldly taxed the mutineers with insincerity. A motion for local\r\noption was carried by 229 to 203, both Mr. Gladstone and Lord Hartington\r\nin the minority. On a motion about clerical restrictions, only a strong\r\nand conciliatory appeal from the prime minister averted defeat. A more\r\nremarkable demonstration soon followed. The Prince Imperial, unfortunate\r\nson of unfortunate sire, who had undergone his famous baptism of fire in\r\nthe first reverses among the Vosges in the Franco-German war of 1870, was\r\nkilled in our war in Zululand. Parliament was asked to sanction a vote of\r\nmoney for a memorial of him in the Abbey. A radical member brought forward\r\na motion against it. Both Mr. Gladstone and Sir Stafford Northcote\r\nresisted him, yet by a considerable majority the radical carried his\r\npoint. The feeling was so strong among the ministerialists, that\r\nnotwithstanding Mr. Gladstone’s earnest exhortation, they voted almost to\r\na man against him, and he only carried into the lobby ten official votes\r\non the treasury bench.\r\n\r\nThe great case in which the government were taken to have missed the\r\nimport of the election was the failure to recall Sir Bartle Frere from\r\nSouth Africa. Of this I shall have enough to say by and by. Meanwhile it\r\ngave an undoubted shock to the confidence of the party, and their\r\nenergetic remonstrance on this head strained Mr. Gladstone’s authority to\r\nthe uttermost. The Queen complained of the tendency of the House of\r\nCommons to trench upon the business of the executive. Mr. Gladstone said\r\nin reply generally, that no doubt within the half century “there had been\r\nconsiderable invasion by the House of Commons of the province assigned by\r\nthe constitution to the executive,” but he perceived no increase in recent\r\ntimes or in the present House. Then he proceeded (June 8, 1880):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    ... Your Majesty may possibly have in view the pressure which has\r\n    been exercised on the present government in the case of Sir Bartle\r\n    Frere. But apart from the fact that this pressure represents a\r\n    feeling which extends far beyond the walls of parliament, your\r\n    Majesty may probably remember that, in the early part of 1835, the\r\n    House of Commons addressed the crown against the appointment of\r\n    Lord Londonderry to be ambassador at St. Petersburg, on (M3)\r\n    account, if Mr. Gladstone remembers rightly, of a general\r\n    antecedent disapproval. This was an exercise of power going far\r\n    beyond what has happened now; nor does it seem easy in principle\r\n    to place the conduct of Sir B. Frere beyond that general right of\r\n    challenge and censure which is unquestionably within the function\r\n    of parliament and especially of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the field where mastery had never failed him, Mr. Gladstone achieved an\r\nearly success, and he lost no time in justifying his assumption of the\r\nexchequer. The budget (June 10) was marked by the boldness of former days,\r\nand was explained and defended in one of those statements of which he\r\nalone possessed the secret. Even unfriendly witnesses agreed that it was\r\nmany years since the House of Commons had the opportunity of enjoying so\r\nextraordinary an intellectual treat, where “novelties assumed the air of\r\nindisputable truths, and complicated figures were woven into the thread of\r\nintelligible and animated narrative.” He converted the malt tax into a\r\nbeer duty, reduced the duties on light foreign wines, added a penny to the\r\nincome tax, and adjusted the licence duties for the sale of alcoholic\r\nliquors. Everybody said that “none but a _cordon bleu_ could have made\r\nsuch a sauce with so few materials.” The dish was excellently received,\r\nand the ministerial party were in high spirits. The conservatives stood\r\nangry and amazed that their own leaders had found no device for the repeal\r\nof the malt duty. The farmer’s friends, they cried, had been in office for\r\nsix years and had done nothing; no sooner is Gladstone at the exchequer\r\nthan with magic wand he effects a transformation, and the long-suffering\r\nagriculturist has justice and relief.\r\n\r\nIn the course of an effort that seemed to show full vigour of body and\r\nmind, Mr. Gladstone incidentally mentioned that when a new member he\r\nrecollected hearing a speech upon the malt tax in the old House of Commons\r\nin the year 1833. Yet the lapse of nearly half a century of life in that\r\ngreat arena had not relaxed his stringent sense of parliamentary duty.\r\nDuring most of the course of this first session, he was always early in\r\nhis place and always left late. In every discussion he came to the front,\r\nand though an under-secretary made the official reply, it was the prime\r\nminister who wound up. One night he made no fewer than six speeches,\r\ntouching all the questions raised in a miscellaneous night’s sitting.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the summer Mr. Gladstone fell ill. Consternation reigned\r\nin London. It even exceeded the dismay caused by the defeat at Maiwand. A\r\nfriend went to see him as he lay in bed. “He talked most of the time, not\r\non politics, but on Shakespeare’s Henry viii., and the decay of\r\ntheological study at Oxford. He never intended his reform measure to\r\nproduce this result.” After his recovery, he went for a cruise in the\r\n_Grantully Castle_, not returning to parliament until September 4, three\r\ndays before the session ended, when he spoke with all his force on the\r\neastern question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the electoral campaign Mr. Gladstone had used expressions about Austria\r\nthat gave some offence at Vienna. On coming into power he volunteered an\r\nassurance to the Austrian ambassador that he would willingly withdraw his\r\nlanguage if he understood that he had misapprehended the circumstances.\r\nThe ambassador said that Austria meant strictly to observe the treaty of\r\nBerlin. Mr. Gladstone then expressed his regret for the words “of a\r\npainful and wounding character” that had fallen from him. At the time, he\r\nexplained, he was “in a position of greater freedom and less\r\nresponsibility.”\r\n\r\nAt the close of the session of 1880, ministers went to work upon the\r\nunfulfilled portions of the Berlin treaty relating to Greece and\r\nMontenegro. Those stipulations were positive in the case of Montenegro; as\r\nto Greece they were less definite, but they absolutely implied a cession\r\nof more or less territory by Turkey. They formed the basis of Lord\r\nSalisbury’s correspondence, but his arguments and representations were\r\nwithout effect.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone and his colleagues went further. They proposed and obtained\r\na demonstration off the Albanian coast on behalf of Montenegro. Each great\r\nPower sent a man-of-war, but the concert of Europe instantly became what\r\n(M4) Mr. Gladstone called a farce, for Austria and Germany made known that\r\nunder no circumstances would they fire a shot. France rather less\r\nprominently took the same course. This defection, which was almost\r\nboastful on the part of Austria and Germany, convinced the British cabinet\r\nthat Turkish obduracy would only be overcome by force, and the question\r\nwas how to apply force effectually with the least risk to peace. As it\r\nhappened, the port of Smyrna received an amount of customs’ duties too\r\nconsiderable for the Porte to spare it. The idea was that the united fleet\r\nat Cattaro should straightway sail to Smyrna and lay hold upon it. The\r\ncabinet, with experts from the two fighting departments, weighed carefully\r\nall the military responsibilities, and considered the sequestration of the\r\ncustoms’ dues at Smyrna to be practicable. Russia and Italy were friendly.\r\nFrance had in a certain way assumed special cognisance of the Greek case,\r\nbut did nothing particular. From Austria and Germany nothing was to be\r\nhoped. On October 4, the Sultan refused the joint European request for the\r\nfulfilment of the engagements entered into at Berlin. This refusal was\r\ndespatched in ignorance of the intention to coerce. The British government\r\nhad only resolved upon coercion in concert with Europe. Full concert was\r\nnow out of the question. But on the morning of Sunday, the 10th, Mr.\r\nGladstone and Lord Granville learned with as much surprise as delight from\r\nMr. Goschen, then ambassador extraordinary at Constantinople, that the\r\nSultan had heard of the British proposal of force, and apparently had not\r\nheard of the two refusals. On learning how far England had gone, he\r\ndetermined to give way on both the territorial questions. As Mr. Gladstone\r\nenters in his diary, “a faint tinge of doubt remained.” That is to say,\r\nthe Sultan might find out the rift in the concert and retract. Russia,\r\nhowever, had actually agreed to force. On Tuesday, the 12th, Mr.\r\nGladstone, meeting Lord Granville and another colleague, was “under the\r\ncircumstances prepared to proceed _en trois_.” The other two “rather\r\ndiffered.” Of course it would have been for the whole cabinet to decide.\r\nBut between eleven and twelve Lord Granville came in with the news that\r\nthe note had arrived and all was well. “The whole of this extraordinary\r\nvolte-face,” as Mr. Gladstone said with some complacency, “had been\r\neffected within six days; and it was entirely due not to a threat of\r\ncoercion from Europe, but to the knowledge that Great Britain had asked\r\nEurope to coerce.” Dulcigno was ceded by the Porte to Montenegro. On the\r\nGreek side of the case, the minister for once was less ardent than for the\r\ncomplete triumph of his heroic Montenegrins, but after tedious\r\nnegotiations Mr. Gladstone had the satisfaction of seeing an important\r\nrectification of the Greek frontier, almost restoring his Homeric Greece.\r\nThe eastern question looked as if it might fall into one of its fitful\r\nslumbers once more, but we shall soon see that this was illusory. Mr.\r\nGoschen left Constantinople in May, and the prime minister said to him\r\n(June 3, 1881):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I write principally for the purpose of offering you my hearty\r\n    congratulations on the place you have taken in diplomacy by force\r\n    of mind and character, and on the services which, in thus far\r\n    serving the most honourable aims a man can have, you have rendered\r\n    to liberty and humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly in Afghanistan was there a direct reversal of the policy of the\r\nfallen government. The new cabinet were not long in deciding on a return\r\nto the older policy in respect of the north-west frontier of India. All\r\nthat had happened since it had been abandoned, strengthened the case\r\nagainst the new departure. The policy that had been pursued amid so many\r\nlamentable and untoward circumstances, including the destruction of a very\r\ngallant agent of England at Cabul, had involved the incorporation of\r\nCandahar within the sphere of the Indian system. Mr. Gladstone and his\r\ncabinet determined on the evacuation of Candahar. The decision was made\r\npublic in the royal speech of the following January (1881). Lord\r\nHartington stated the case of the government with masterly and crushing\r\nforce, in a speech,(2) which is no less than a strong text-book of the\r\nwhole argument, if any reader should now desire to comprehend it. The\r\nevacuation was censured in the Lords by 165 against 79; in the Commons\r\nministers carried the day by a majority of 120.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II. An Episode In Toleration. (1880-1883)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The state, in choosing men to serve it, takes no notice of their\r\n    opinions; if they be willing faithfully to serve it, that\r\n    satisfies. ... Take heed of being sharp, or too easily sharpened\r\n    by others, against those to whom you can object little but that\r\n    they square not with you in every opinion concerning matters of\r\n    religion.\r\n\r\n    —OLIVER CROMWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nOne discordant refrain rang hoarsely throughout the five years of this\r\nadministration, and its first notes were heard even before Mr. Gladstone\r\nhad taken his seat. It drew him into a controversy that was probably more\r\ndistasteful to him than any other of the myriad contentions, small and\r\ngreat, with which his life was encumbered. Whether or not he threaded his\r\nway with his usual skill through a labyrinth of parliamentary tactics\r\nincomparably intricate, experts may dispute, but in an ordeal beyond the\r\nregion of tactics he never swerved from the path alike of liberty and\r\ncommon-sense. It was a question of exacting the oath of allegiance before\r\na member could take his seat.\r\n\r\nMr. Bradlaugh, the new member for Northampton, who now forced the question\r\nforward, as O’Connell had forced forward the civil equality of catholics,\r\nand Rothschild and others the civil equality of Jews, was a free-thinker\r\nof a daring and defiant type. Blank negation could go no further. He had\r\nabundant and genuine public spirit, and a strong love of truth according\r\nto his own lights, and he was both a brave and a disinterested man. This\r\nhard-grit secularism of his was not the worst of his offences in the view\r\nof the new majority and their constituents. He had published an\r\nimpeachment of the House of Brunswick, which few members of parliament had\r\never heard of or looked at. But even abstract republicanism was not the\r\nworst. What placed him at extreme disadvantage in fighting the battle in\r\nwhich he was now engaged, was his republication of a pamphlet by an\r\nAmerican doctor on that impracticable question of population, which though\r\ntoo rigorously excluded from public discussion, confessedly lies among the\r\nroots of most other social questions. For this he had some years before\r\nbeen indicted in the courts, and had only escaped conviction and\r\npunishment by a technicality. It was Mr. Bradlaugh’s refusal to take the\r\noath in a court of justice that led to the law of 1869, enabling a witness\r\nto affirm instead of swearing. He now carried the principle a step\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came, the Speaker (April 29) received a letter from the\r\niconoclast, claiming to make an affirmation, instead of taking the oath of\r\nallegiance.(3) He consulted his legal advisers, and they gave an opinion\r\nstrongly adverse to the claim. On this the Speaker wrote to Mr. Gladstone\r\nand to Sir Stafford Northcote, stating his concurrence in the opinion of\r\nthe lawyers, and telling them that he should leave the question to the\r\nHouse. His practical suggestion was that on his statement being made, a\r\nmotion should be proposed for a select committee. The committee was duly\r\nappointed, and it reported by a majority of one, against a minority that\r\ncontained names so weighty as Sir Henry James, Herschell, Whitbread, and\r\nBright, that the claim to affirm was not a good claim. So opened a series\r\nof incidents that went on as long as the parliament, clouded the radiance\r\nof the party triumph, threw the new government at once into a minority,\r\ndimmed the ascendency of the great minister, and what was more, showed\r\nhuman nature at its worst. The incidents themselves are in detail not\r\nworth recalling here, but they are a striking episode in the history of\r\ntoleration, as well as a landmark in Mr. Gladstone’s journey from the day\r\nfive-and-forty years before when, in (M5) reference to Molesworth as\r\ncandidate for Leeds, he had told his friends at Newark that men who had no\r\nbelief in divine revelation were not the men to govern this nation whether\r\nthey be whigs or radicals.(4)\r\n\r\nHis claim to affirm having been rejected, Bradlaugh next desired to swear.\r\nThe ministerial whip reported that the feeling against him in the House\r\nwas uncontrollable. The Speaker held a council in his library with Mr.\r\nGladstone, the law officers, the whip, and two or three other persons of\r\nauthority and sense. He told them that if Bradlaugh had in the first\r\ninstance come to take the oath, he should have allowed no intervention,\r\nbut that the case was altered by the claimant’s open declaration that an\r\noath was not binding on his conscience. A hostile motion was expected when\r\nBradlaugh came to the table to be sworn, and the Speaker suggested that it\r\nshould be met by the previous question, to be moved by Mr. Gladstone. Then\r\nthe whip broke in with the assurance that the usual supporters of the\r\ngovernment could not be relied upon. The Speaker went upstairs to dress,\r\nand on his return found that they had agreed on moving another select\r\ncommittee. He told them that he thought this a weak course, but if the\r\nprevious question would be defeated, perhaps a committee could not be\r\nhelped. Bradlaugh came to the table, and the hostile motion was made. Mr.\r\nGladstone proposed his committee, and carried it by a good majority\r\nagainst the motion that Bradlaugh, being without religious belief, could\r\nnot take an oath. The debate was warm, and the attacks on Bradlaugh were\r\noften gross. The Speaker honourably pointed out that such attacks on an\r\nelected member whose absence was enforced by their own order, were unfair\r\nand unbecoming, but the feelings of the House were too strong for him and\r\ntoo strong for chivalry. The opposition turned affairs to ignoble party\r\naccount, and were not ashamed in their prints and elsewhere to level the\r\ncharge of “open patronage of unbelief and Malthusianism, Bradlaugh and\r\nBlasphemy,” against a government that contained Gladstone, Bright, and\r\nSelborne, three of the most conspicuously devout men to be found in all\r\nEngland. One expression of faith used by a leader in the attack on\r\nBradlaugh lived in Mr. Gladstone’s memory to the end of his days. “You\r\nknow, Mr. Speaker,” cried the champion of orthodox creeds, “we all of us\r\nbelieve in a God of some sort or another.” That a man should consent to\r\nclothe the naked human soul in this truly singular and scanty remnant of\r\nspiritual apparel, was held to be the unalterable condition of fitness for\r\na seat in parliament and the company of decent people. Well might Mr.\r\nGladstone point out how vast a disparagement of Christianity, and of\r\northodox theism also, was here involved:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    They say this, that you may go any length you please in the denial\r\n    of religion, provided only you do not reject the name of the\r\n    Deity. They tear religion into shreds, so to speak, and say that\r\n    there is one particular shred with which nothing will ever induce\r\n    them to part. They divide religion into the dispensable and the\r\n    indispensable, and among that kind which can be dispensed with—I\r\n    am not now speaking of those who declare, or are admitted, under a\r\n    special law, I am not speaking of Jews or those who make a\r\n    declaration, I am speaking solely of those for whom no provision\r\n    is made except the provision of oath—they divide, I say, religion\r\n    into what can and what cannot be dispensed with. There is\r\n    something, however, that cannot be dispensed with. I am not\r\n    willing, Sir, that Christianity, if the appeal is made to us as a\r\n    Christian legislature, shall stand in any rank lower than that\r\n    which is indispensable. I may illustrate what I mean. Suppose a\r\n    commander has to despatch a small body of men on an expedition on\r\n    which it is necessary for them to carry on their backs all that\r\n    they can take with them; the men will part with everything that is\r\n    unnecessary, and take only that which is essential. That is the\r\n    course you ask us to take in drawing us upon theological ground;\r\n    you require us to distinguish between superfluities and\r\n    necessaries, and you tell us that Christianity is one of the\r\n    superfluities, one of the excrescences, and has nothing to do with\r\n    the vital substance, the name of the Deity, which is\r\n    indispensable. I say that the adoption of such a proposition as\r\n    that, which is in reality at the very root of your contention, is\r\n    disparaging in the very highest degree to the Christian\r\n    faith....(5)\r\n\r\n\r\n(M6) Even viewed as a theistic test, he contended, this oath embraced no\r\nacknowledgment of Providence, of divine government, of responsibility, or\r\nretribution; it involved nothing but a bare and abstract admission, a form\r\nvoid of all practical meaning and concern.\r\n\r\nThe House, however, speedily showed how inaccessible were most of its\r\nmembers to reason and argument of this kind or any kind. On June 21, Mr.\r\nGladstone thus described the proceedings to the Queen. “With the renewal\r\nof the discussion,” he wrote, “the temper of the House does not improve,\r\nboth excitement and suspicion appearing to prevail in different quarters.”\r\nA motion made by Mr. Bradlaugh’s colleague that he should be permitted to\r\naffirm, was met by a motion that he should not be allowed either to affirm\r\nor to swear.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To the Queen._\r\n\r\n    Many warm speeches were made by the opposition in the name of\r\n    religion; to those Mr. Bright has warmly replied in the name of\r\n    religious liberty. The contention on the other side really is that\r\n    as to a certain ill-defined fragment of truth the House is still,\r\n    under the Oaths Act, the guardian of religion. The primary\r\n    question, whether the House has jurisdiction under the statute, is\r\n    almost hopelessly mixed with the question whether an atheist, who\r\n    has declared himself an atheist, ought to sit in parliament. Mr.\r\n    Gladstone’s own view is that the House has no jurisdiction for the\r\n    purpose of excluding any one willing to qualify when he has been\r\n    duly elected; but he is very uncertain how the House will vote or\r\n    what will be the end of the business, if the House undertakes the\r\n    business of exclusion.\r\n\r\n    _June 22._—The House of Commons has been occupied from the\r\n    commencement of the evening until a late hour with the adjourned\r\n    debate on the case of Mr. Bradlaugh. The divided state of opinion\r\n    in the House made itself manifest throughout the evening. Mr.\r\n    Newdegate made a speech which turned almost wholly upon the\r\n    respective merits of theism and atheism. Mr. Gladstone thought it\r\n    his duty to advise the House to beware of entangling itself in\r\n    difficulties possibly of a serious character, by assuming a\r\n    jurisdiction in cases of this class.\r\n\r\n    At one o’clock in the morning, the first great division was taken,\r\n    and the House resolved by 275 votes against 230 that Mr. Bradlaugh\r\n    should neither affirm nor swear. The excitement at this result was\r\n    tremendous. Some minutes elapsed before the Speaker could declare\r\n    the numbers. “Indeed,” wrote Mr. Gladstone to the Queen, “it was\r\n    an ecstatic transport, and exceeded anything which Mr. Gladstone\r\n    remembers to have witnessed. He read in it only a witness to the\r\n    dangers of the course on which the House has entered, and to its\r\n    unfitness for the office which it has rashly chosen to assume.” He\r\n    might also have read in it, if he had liked, the exquisite delight\r\n    of the first stroke of revenge for Midlothian.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day (June 23) the matter entered on a more violent phase.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To the Queen._\r\n\r\n    This day, when the Speaker took the chair at a quarter past\r\n    twelve, Mr. Bradlaugh came to the table and claimed to take the\r\n    oath. The Speaker read to him the resolution of the House which\r\n    forbids it. Mr. Bradlaugh asked to be heard, and no objection was\r\n    taken. He then addressed the House from the bar. His address was\r\n    that of a consummate speaker. But it was an address which could\r\n    not have any effect unless the House had undergone a complete\r\n    revolution of mind. He challenged the legality of the act of the\r\n    House, expressing hereby an opinion in which Mr. Gladstone\r\n    himself, going beyond some other members of the minority, has the\r\n    misfortune to lean towards agreeing with him.... The Speaker now\r\n    again announced to Mr. Bradlaugh the resolution of the House. Only\r\n    a small minority voted against enforcing it. Mr. Bradlaugh\r\n    declining to withdraw, was removed by the serjeant-at-arms. Having\r\n    suffered this removal, he again came beyond the bar, and entered\r\n    into what was almost a corporal struggle with the serjeant.\r\n    Hereupon Sir S. Northcote moved that Mr. Bradlaugh be committed\r\n    for his offence. Mr. Gladstone said that while he thought it did\r\n    not belong to him, under the circumstances of the case, to advise\r\n    the House, he could take no objection to the advice thus given.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Speaker, it may be said, thought this view of (M7) Mr. Gladstone’s a\r\nmistake, and that when Bradlaugh refused to withdraw, the leader of the\r\nHouse ought, as a matter of policy, to have been the person to move first\r\nthe order to withdraw, next the committal to the custody of the\r\nserjeant-at-arms. “I was placed in a false position,” says the Speaker,\r\n“and so was the House, in having to follow the lead of the leader of the\r\nopposition, while the leader of the House and the great majority were\r\npassive spectators.”(6) As Mr. Gladstone and other members of the\r\ngovernment voted for Bradlaugh’s committal, on the ground that his\r\nresistance to the serjeant had nothing to do with the establishment of his\r\nrights before either a court or his constituency, it would seem that the\r\nSpeaker’s complaint is not unjust. To this position, however, Mr.\r\nGladstone adhered, in entire conformity apparently to the wishes of the\r\nkeenest members of his cabinet and the leading men of his party.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker wrote to Sir Stafford Northcote urging on him the propriety of\r\nallowing Bradlaugh to take the oath without question. But Northcote was\r\nforced on against his better judgment by his more ardent supporters. It\r\nwas a strange and painful situation, and the party system assuredly did\r\nnot work at its best—one leading man forced on to mischief by the least\r\nresponsible of his sections, the other held back from providing a cure by\r\nthe narrowest of the other sections. In the April of 1881 Mr. Gladstone\r\ngave notice of a bill providing for affirmation, but it was immediately\r\napparent that the opposition would make the most of every obstacle to a\r\nsettlement, and the proposal fell through. In August of this year the\r\nSpeaker notes, “The difficulties in the way of settling this question\r\nsatisfactorily are great, and in the present temper of the House almost\r\ninsuperable.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to recount all the stages of this protracted struggle:\r\nwhat devices and expedients and motions, how many odious scenes of\r\nphysical violence, how many hard-fought actions in the lawcourts, how many\r\nconflicts between the House of Commons and the constituency, what glee and\r\nrubbing of hands in the camp of the opposition at having thrust their\r\nrivals deep into a quagmire so unpleasant. The scandal was intolerable,\r\nbut ministers were helpless, as a marked incident now demonstrated. It was\r\nnot until 1883 that a serious attempt was made to change the law. The\r\nAffirmation bill of that year has a biographic place, because it marks in\r\na definite way how far Mr. Gladstone’s mind—perhaps not, as I have said\r\nbefore, by nature or by instinct peculiarly tolerant—had travelled along\r\none of the grand highroads of human progress. The occasion was for many\r\nreasons one of great anxiety. Here are one or two short entries, the\r\nreader remembering that by this time the question was two years old:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _April 24, Tuesday._—On Sunday night a gap of three hours in my\r\n    sleep was rather ominous; but it was not repeated.... Saw the\r\n    Archbishop of Canterbury, with whom I had a very long conversation\r\n    on the Affirmation bill and on _Church and State_. Policy\r\n    generally as well as on special subjects.... Globe Theatre in the\r\n    evening; excellent acting.... 25.... Worked on Oaths question....\r\n    26.... Made a long and _begeistert_(7) speech on the Affirmation\r\n    bill, taking the bull by the horns.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis speech upon this measure was a noble effort. It was delivered under\r\ncircumstances of unsurpassed difficulty, for there was revolt in the\r\nparty, the client was repugnant, the opinions brought into issue were to\r\nMr. Gladstone hateful. Yet the speech proved one of his greatest.\r\nImposing, lofty, persuasive, sage it would have been, from whatever lips\r\nit might have fallen; it was signal indeed as coming from one so fervid,\r\nso definite, so unfaltering in a faith of his own, one who had started\r\nfrom the opposite pole to that great civil principle of which he now\r\ndisplayed a grasp invincible. If it be true of a writer that the best\r\nstyle is that which most directly flows from living qualities in the\r\nwriter’s own mind and is a pattern of their actual working, so is the same\r\nthing to be said of oratory. These high themes of Faith, on the one hand,\r\nand Freedom on the (M8) other, exactly fitted the range of the thoughts in\r\nwhich Mr. Gladstone habitually lived. “I have no fear of Atheism in this\r\nHouse,” he said; “Truth is the expression of the Divine mind, and however\r\nlittle our feeble vision may be able to discern the means by which God may\r\nprovide for its preservation, we may leave the matter in His hands, and we\r\nmay be sure that a firm and courageous application of every principle of\r\nequity and of justice is the best method we can adopt for the preservation\r\nand influence of Truth.” This was Mr. Gladstone at his sincerest and his\r\nhighest. I wonder, too, if there has been a leader in parliament since the\r\nseventeenth century, who could venture to address it in the strain of the\r\nmemorable passage now to be transcribed:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    You draw your line at the point where the abstract denial of God\r\n    is severed from the abstract admission of the Deity. My\r\n    proposition is that the line thus drawn is worthless, and that\r\n    much on your side of the line is as objectionable as the atheism\r\n    on the other. If you call upon us to make distinctions, let them\r\n    at least be rational; I do not say let them be Christian\r\n    distinctions, but let them be rational. I can understand one\r\n    rational distinction, that you should frame the oath in such a way\r\n    as to recognise not only the existence of the Deity, but the\r\n    providence of the Deity, and man’s responsibility to the Deity;\r\n    and in such a way as to indicate the knowledge in a man’s own mind\r\n    that he must answer to the Deity for what he does, and is able to\r\n    do. But is that your present rule? No, Sir, you know very well\r\n    that from ancient times there have been sects and schools that\r\n    have admitted in the abstract as freely as Christians the\r\n    existence of a Deity, but have held that of practical relations\r\n    between Him and man there can be none. Many of the members of this\r\n    House will recollect the majestic and noble lines—\r\n\r\n    Omnis enim per se divom natura necesse est\r\n    Immortali ævo summa cum pace fruatur,\r\n    Semota a nostris rebus sejunctaque longe.\r\n    Nam privata dolore omni, privata periclis,\r\n    Ipsa suis pollens opibus, nihil indiga nostri,\r\n    Nec bene promeritis capitur, nec tangitur ira.(8)\r\n\r\n    “Divinity exists”—according to these, I must say, magnificent\r\n    lines—“in remote and inaccessible recesses; but with, us it has no\r\n    dealing, of us it has no need, with us it has no relation.” I do\r\n    not hesitate to say that the specific evil, the specific form of\r\n    irreligion, with which in the educated society of this country you\r\n    have to contend, and with respect to which you ought to be on your\r\n    guard, is not blank atheism. That is a rare opinion very seldom\r\n    met with; but what is frequently met with is that form of opinion\r\n    which would teach us that, whatever may be beyond the visible\r\n    things of this world, whatever there may be beyond this short span\r\n    of life, you know and you can know nothing of it, and that it is a\r\n    bootless undertaking to attempt to establish relations with it.\r\n    That is the mischief of the age, and that mischief you do not\r\n    attempt to touch.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe House, though but few perhaps recollected their Lucretius or had ever\r\neven read him, sat, as I well remember, with reverential stillness,\r\nhearkening from this born master of moving cadence and high sustained\r\nmodulation to “the rise and long roll of the hexameter,”—to the plangent\r\nlines that have come down across the night of time to us from great Rome.\r\nBut all these impressions of sublime feeling and strong reasoning were\r\nsoon effaced by honest bigotry, by narrow and selfish calculation, by flat\r\ncowardice. The relieving bill was cast out by a majority of three. The\r\ncatholics in the main voted against it, and many nonconformists,\r\nhereditary champions of all the rights of private judgment, either voted\r\nagainst it or did not vote at all. So soon in these affairs, as the world\r\nhas long ago found out, do bodies of men forget in a day of power the\r\nmaxims that they held sacred and inviolable in days when they were weak.\r\n\r\nThe drama did not end here. In that parliament Bradlaugh was never allowed\r\nto discharge his duty as a member, but when after the general election of\r\n1885, being once more chosen by Northampton, he went to the table to take\r\nthe oath, as in former days Mill and others of like non-theologic\r\ncomplexion had taken it, the Speaker would suffer no intervention against\r\nhim. Then in 1888, though the majority was conservative, Bradlaugh himself\r\nsecured the passing of an affirmation (M9) law. Finally, in the beginning\r\nof 1891, upon the motion of a Scotch member, supported by Mr. Gladstone,\r\nthe House formally struck out from its records the resolution of June 22,\r\n1881, that had been passed, as we have seen, amid “ecstatic transports.”\r\nBradlaugh then lay upon his deathbed, and was unconscious of what had been\r\ndone. Mr. Gladstone a few days later, in moving a bill of his own to\r\ndiscard a lingering case of civil disability attached to religious\r\nprofession, made a last reference to Mr. Bradlaugh:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    A distinguished man, he said, and admirable member of this House,\r\n    was laid yesterday in his mother-earth. He was the subject of a\r\n    long controversy in this House—a controversy the beginning of\r\n    which we recollect, and the ending of which we recollect. We\r\n    remember with what zeal it was prosecuted; we remember how\r\n    summarily it was dropped; we remember also what reparation has\r\n    been done within the last few days to the distinguished man who\r\n    was the immediate object of that controversy. But does anybody who\r\n    hears me believe that that controversy, so prosecuted and so\r\n    abandoned, was beneficial to the Christian religion?(9)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III. Majuba. (1880-1881)\r\n\r\n\r\n    εἰς ἀπέραντον δίκτυον  ἄτης\r\n    ἐμπλεχθήσεσθ᾽ ὑπ᾽ ἀνοίας.\r\n\r\n    —Æsch. _Prom._ 1078.\r\n\r\n    In a boundless coil of mischief pure senselessness will entangle\r\n    you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would almost need the pen of Tacitus or Dante to tell the story of\r\nEuropean power in South Africa. For forty years, said Mr. Gladstone in\r\n1881, “I have always regarded the South African question as the one great\r\nunsolved and perhaps insoluble problem of our colonial system.” Among the\r\nother legacies of the forward policy that the constituencies had\r\ndecisively condemned in 1880, this insoluble problem rapidly became acute\r\nand formidable.\r\n\r\nOne of the great heads of impeachment in Midlothian had been a war\r\nundertaken in 1878-9 against a fierce tribe on the borders of the colony\r\nof Natal. The author and instrument of the Zulu war was Sir Bartle Frere,\r\na man of tenacious character and grave and lofty if ill-calculated aims.\r\nThe conservative government, as I have already said,(10) without\r\nenthusiasm assented, and at one stage they even formally censured him.\r\nWhen Mr. Gladstone acceded to office, the expectation was universal that\r\nSir Bartle would be at once recalled. At the first meeting of the new\r\ncabinet (May 3) it was decided to retain him. The prime minister at first\r\nwas his marked protector. The substantial reason against recall was that\r\nhis presence was needed to carry out the policy of confederation, and\r\ntowards confederation it was hoped that the Cape parliament was\r\nimmediately about to take (M10) a long preliminary step. “Confederation,”\r\nMr. Gladstone said, “is the pole-star of the present action of our\r\ngovernment.” In a few weeks, for a reason that will be mentioned in\r\ntreating the second episode of this chapter, confederation broke down. A\r\nless substantial but still not wholly inoperative reason was the strong\r\nfeeling of the Queen for the high commissioner. The royal prepossessions\r\nnotwithstanding, and in spite of the former leanings of Mr. Gladstone, the\r\ncabinet determined, at the end of July, that Sir Bartle should be\r\nrecalled. The whole state of the case is made sufficiently clear in the\r\ntwo following communications from the prime minister to the Queen:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To the Queen._\r\n\r\n    _May 28, 1880._—Mr. Gladstone presents his humble duty, and has\r\n    had the honour to receive your Majesty’s telegram respecting Sir\r\n    B. Frere. Mr. Gladstone used on Saturday his best efforts to avert\r\n    a movement for his dismissal, which it was intended by a powerful\r\n    body of members on the liberal side to promote by a memorial to\r\n    Mr. Gladstone, and by a motion in the House. He hopes that he has\r\n    in some degree succeeded, and he understands that it is to be\r\n    decided on Monday whether they will at present desist or\r\n    persevere. Of course no sign will be given by your Majesty’s\r\n    advisers which could tend to promote perseverance, at the same\r\n    time Mr. Gladstone does not conceal from himself two things: the\r\n    first, that the only chance of Sir B. Frere’s remaining seems to\r\n    depend upon his ability to make progress in the matter of\r\n    confederation; the second, that if the agitation respecting him in\r\n    the House, the press, and the country should continue, confidence\r\n    in him may be so paralysed as to render his situation intolerable\r\n    to a high-minded man and to weaken his hands fatally for any\r\n    purpose of good.\r\n\r\n    _July 29, 1880._—It was not without some differences of opinion\r\n    among themselves that, upon their accession to office, the cabinet\r\n    arrived at the conclusion that, if there was a prospect of\r\n    progress in the great matter of confederation, this might afford a\r\n    ground of co-operation between them and Sir B. Frere,\r\n    notwithstanding the strong censures which many of them in\r\n    opposition had pronounced upon his policy. This conclusion gave\r\n    the liveliest satisfaction to a large portion, perhaps to the\r\n    majority, of the House of Commons; but they embraced it with the\r\n    more satisfaction because of your Majesty’s warm regard for Sir B.\r\n    Frere, a sentiment which some among them personally share.\r\n\r\n    It was evident, however, and it was perhaps in the nature of the\r\n    case, that a confidence thus restricted was far from agreeable to\r\n    Sir B. Frere, who, in the opinion of Mr. Gladstone, has only been\r\n    held back by a commendable self-restraint and sense of duty, from\r\n    declaring himself aggrieved. Thus, though the cabinet have done\r\n    the best they could, his standing ground was not firm, nor could\r\n    they make it so. But the total failure of the effort made to\r\n    induce the Cape parliament to move, has put confederation wholly\r\n    out of view, for a time quite indefinite, and almost certainly\r\n    considerable. Mr. Gladstone has therefore the painful duty of\r\n    submitting to your Majesty, on behalf of the Cabinet, the enclosed\r\n    copy of a ciphered telegram of recall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe breaking of the military power of the Zulus was destined to prove much\r\nless important than another proceeding closely related to it, though not\r\ndrawing the same attention at the moment. I advise the reader not to\r\ngrudge a rather strict regard to the main details of transactions that,\r\nowing to unhappy events of later date, have to this day held a conspicuous\r\nplace in the general controversy as to the great minister’s statesmanship.\r\n\r\nFor some time past, powerful native tribes had been slowly but steadily\r\npushing the Boers of the Transvaal back, and the inability to resist was\r\nnow dangerously plain. In 1876 the Boers had been worsted in one of their\r\nincessant struggles with the native races, and this time they had barely\r\nbeen able to hold their own against an insignificant tribe of one of the\r\nleast warlike branches. It was thought certain by English officials on the\r\nground, that the example would not be lost on fiercer warriors, and that a\r\nnative conflagration might any day burst into blaze in other regions of\r\nthe immense territory. The British government despatched an agent of great\r\nlocal experience; he found the Boer (M11) government, which was loosely\r\norganised even at its best, now completely paralysed, without money,\r\nwithout internal authority, without defensive power against external foes.\r\nIn alarm at the possible result of such a situation on the peace of the\r\nEuropean domain in South Africa, he proclaimed the sovereignty of the\r\nQueen, and set up an administration. This he was empowered by secret\r\ninstructions to do, if he should think fit. Here was the initial error.\r\nThe secretary of state in Downing Street approved (June 21, 1877), on the\r\nexpress assumption that a sufficient number of the inhabitants desired to\r\nbecome the Queen’s subjects. Some have thought that if he had waited the\r\nBoers would have sought annexation, but this seems to be highly\r\nimprobable. In the annexation proclamation promises were made to the Boers\r\nof ’the fullest legislative privileges compatible with the circumstances\r\nof the country and the intelligence of the people.’ An assembly was also\r\npromised.\r\n\r\nThe soundness of the assumption was immediately disputed. The Boer\r\ngovernment protested against annexation. Two delegates—one of them Mr.\r\nKruger—repaired to England, assured Lord Carnarvon that their fellow-Boers\r\nwere vehemently opposed to annexation, and earnestly besought its\r\nreversal. The minister insisted that he was right and they were wrong.\r\nThey went back, and in order to convince the government of the true\r\nstrength of feeling for independence, petitions were prepared seeking the\r\nrestoration of independence. The signatures were those of qualified\r\nelectors of the old republic. The government were informed by Sir Garnet\r\nWolseley that there were about 8000 persons of the age to be electors, of\r\nwhom rather fewer than 7000 were Boers. To the petitions were appended\r\nalmost exactly 7000 names. The colonial office recognised that the\r\nopposition of the Boers to annexation was practically unanimous. The\r\ncomparatively insignificant addresses on the other side came from the town\r\nand digging population, which was as strong in favour of the suppression\r\nof the old republic, as the rural population was strong against it.\r\n\r\nFor many months the Boers persevered. They again sent Kruger and Joubert\r\nto England; they held huge mass meetings; they poured out prayers to the\r\nhigh commissioner to give back their independence; they sent memorial\r\nafter memorial to the secretary of state. In the autumn of 1879 Sir Garnet\r\nWolseley assumed the administration of the Transvaal, and issued a\r\nproclamation setting forth the will and determination of the government of\r\nthe Queen that this Transvaal territory should be, and should continue to\r\nbe for ever, an integral part of her dominions in South Africa. In the\r\nclosing days of 1879 the secretary of state, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, who\r\nhad succeeded Carnarvon (Jan. 1878), received from the same eminent\r\nsoldier a comprehensive despatch, warning him that the meetings of protest\r\nagainst annexation, attended by thousands of armed men in angry mood,\r\nwould be likely to end in a serious explosion. While putting all sides of\r\nthe question before his government, Sir Garnet inserted one paragraph of\r\nmomentous import. “The Transvaal,” he said, “is rich in minerals; gold has\r\nalready been found in quantities, and there can be little doubt that\r\nlarger and still more valuable goldfields will sooner or later be\r\ndiscovered. Any such discovery would soon bring a large British population\r\nhere. The time must eventually arrive when the Boers will be in a small\r\nminority, as the country is very sparsely peopled, and would it not\r\ntherefore be a very near-sighted policy to recede now from the position we\r\nhave taken up here, simply because for some years to come, the retention\r\nof 2000 or 3000 troops may be necessary to reconsolidate our power?”(11)\r\nThis pregnant and far-sighted warning seems to have been little considered\r\nby English statesmen of either party at this critical time or afterwards,\r\nthough it proved a vital element in any far-sighted decision.\r\n\r\nOn March 9—the day, as it happened, on which the intention to dissolve\r\nparliament was made public—Sir Garnet telegraphed for a renewed expression\r\nof the determination of the government to retain the country, and he\r\nreceived the assurance that he sought. The Vaal river, he told the Boers,\r\nwould flow backwards through the Drakensberg sooner than the British would\r\nbe withdrawn from the Transvaal. The picturesque figure did not soften the\r\nBoer heart. (M12) This was the final share of the conservative cabinet in\r\nthe unfortunate enterprise on which they had allowed the country to be\r\nlaunched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the question of annexation had originally come before parliament, Mr.\r\nGladstone was silent. He was averse to it; he believed that it would\r\ninvolve us in unmixed mischief; but he felt that to make this judgment\r\nknown at that period would not have had any effect towards reversing what\r\nhad been done, while it might impede the chances of a good issue, slender\r\nas these might be.(12) In the discussion at the opening of the final\r\nsession of the old parliament, Lord Hartington as leader of the\r\nopposition, enforcing the general doctrine that it behoved us to\r\nconcentrate our resources, and to limit instead of extending the empire,\r\ntook the Transvaal for an illustration. It was now conclusively proved, he\r\nsaid, that a large majority of the Boers were bitterly against annexation.\r\nThat being so, it ought not to be considered a settled question merely\r\nbecause annexation had taken place; and if we should find that the balance\r\nof advantage was in favour of the restoration of independence, no false\r\nsense of dignity should stand in the way. Mr. Gladstone in Midlothian had\r\nbeen more reserved. In that indictment, there are only two or three\r\nreferences, and those comparatively fugitive and secondary, to this\r\narticle of charge. There is a sentence in one of the Midlothian speeches\r\nabout bringing a territory inhabited by a free European Christian republic\r\nwithin the limits of a monarchy, though out of 8000 persons qualified to\r\nvote, 6500 voted against it. In another sentence he speaks of the\r\nTransvaal as a country “where we have chosen most unwisely, I am tempted\r\nto say insanely, to place ourselves in the strange predicament of the free\r\nsubjects of a monarchy going to coerce the free subjects of a republic,\r\nand to compel them to accept a citizenship which they decline and refuse;\r\nbut if that is to be done, it must be done by force.”(13) A third sentence\r\ncompletes the tale: “If Cyprus and the Transvaal were as valuable as they\r\nare valueless, I would repudiate them because they are obtained by means\r\ndishonourable to the character of the country.” These utterances of the\r\nmighty unofficial chief and the responsible official leader of the\r\nopposition were all. The Boer republicans thought that they were enough.\r\n\r\nOn coming into power, the Gladstone government found the official evidence\r\nall to the effect that the political aspect of the Transvaal was decidedly\r\nimproving. The commissioners, the administrators, the agents, were\r\nunanimous. Even those among them who insisted on the rooted dislike of the\r\nmain body of the Boers to British authority, still thought that they were\r\nacquiescing, exactly as the Boers in the Cape Colony had acquiesced. Could\r\nministers justify abandonment, without far stronger evidence than they\r\nthen possessed that they could not govern the Transvaal peaceably? Among\r\nother things, they were assured that abandonment would be fatal to the\r\nprospects of confederation, and might besides entail a civil war. On May\r\n7, Sir Bartle Frere pressed the new ministers for an early announcement of\r\ntheir policy, in order to prevent the mischiefs of agitation. The cabinet\r\ndecided the question on May 12, and agreed upon the terms of a\r\ntelegram(14) by which Lord Kimberley was to inform Frere that the\r\nsovereignty of the Queen over the Transvaal could not be relinquished, but\r\nthat he hoped the speedy accomplishment of confederation would enable free\r\ninstitutions to be conferred with promptitude. In other words, in spite of\r\nall that had been defiantly said by Lord Hartington, and more cautiously\r\nimplied by Mr. Gladstone, the new government at once placed themselves\r\nexactly in the position of the old one.(15)\r\n\r\nThe case was stated in his usual nervous language by Mr. Chamberlain a few\r\nmonths later.(16) “When we came into office,” (M13) he said, “we were all\r\nagreed that the original annexation was a mistake, that it ought never to\r\nhave been made; and there arose the question could it then be undone? We\r\nwere in possession of information to the effect that the great majority of\r\nthe people of the Transvaal were reconciled to annexation; we were told\r\nthat if we reversed the decision of the late government, there would be a\r\ngreat probability of civil war and anarchy; and acting upon these\r\nrepresentations, we decided that we could not recommend the Queen to\r\nrelinquish her sovereignty. But we assured the Boers that we would take\r\nthe earliest opportunity of granting to them the freest and most complete\r\nlocal institutions compatible with the welfare of South Africa. It is easy\r\nto be wise after the event. It is easy to see now that we were wrong in so\r\ndeciding. I frankly admit we made a mistake. Whatever the risk was, and I\r\nbelieve it was a great risk, of civil war and anarchy in the Transvaal, it\r\nwas not so great a danger as that we actually incurred by maintaining the\r\nwrong of our predecessors.” Such was the language used by Mr. Chamberlain\r\nafter special consultation with Lord Kimberley. With characteristic\r\ntenacity and that aversion ever to yield even the smallest point, which\r\ncomes to a man saturated with the habit of a lifetime of debate, Mr.\r\nGladstone wrote to Mr. Chamberlain (June 8, 1881): “I have read with\r\npleasure what you say of the Transvaal. Yet I am not prepared, for myself,\r\nto concede that we made a mistake in not advising a revocation of the\r\nannexation when we came in.”\r\n\r\nAt this instant a letter reached Mr. Gladstone from Kruger and Joubert\r\n(May 10, 1880), telling him that there was a firm belief among their\r\npeople that truth prevailed. “They were confident that one day or another,\r\nby the mercy of the Lord, the reins of the imperial government would be\r\nentrusted again to men who look out for the honour and glory of England,\r\nnot by acts of injustice and crushing force, but by the way of justice and\r\ngood faith. And, indeed, this belief has proven to be a good belief.” It\r\nwould have been well for the Boers and well for us, if that had indeed\r\nbeen so. Unluckily the reply sent in Mr. Gladstone’s name (June 15),\r\ninformed them that obligations had now been contracted, especially towards\r\nthe natives, that could not be set aside, but that consistently with the\r\nmaintenance of the Queen’s sovereignty over the Transvaal, ministers\r\ndesired that the white inhabitants should enjoy the fullest liberty to\r\nmanage their local affairs. “We believe that this liberty may be most\r\neasily and promptly conceded to the Transvaal, as a member of a South\r\nAfrican confederation.” Solemn and deliberate as this sounds, no step\r\nwhatever was effectively taken towards conferring this full liberty, or\r\nany liberty at all.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while, on this material point, to look back. The original\r\nproclamation had promised the people the fullest legislative privileges\r\ncompatible with the circumstances of the country and the intelligence of\r\nthe people. Then, at a later date (April 1877), Sir Bartle Frere met a\r\ngreat assemblage of Boers, and told them that they should receive, as soon\r\nas circumstances rendered it practicable, as large a measure of\r\nself-government as was enjoyed by any colony in South Africa.(17) The\r\nsecretary of state had also spoken to the same effect. During the short\r\nperiod in which Sir Bartle Frere was connected with the administration of\r\nthe Transvaal, he earnestly pressed upon the government the necessity for\r\nredeeming the promises made at the time of annexation, “of the same\r\nmeasure of perfect self-government now enjoyed by Cape Colony,” always, of\r\ncourse, under the authority of the crown.(18) As the months went on, no\r\nattempt was made to fulfil all these solemn pledges, and the Boers\r\nnaturally began to look on them as so much mockery. Their anger in turn\r\nincreased the timidity of government, and it was argued that the first use\r\nthat the Boers would make of a free constitution would be to stop the\r\nsupplies. So a thing called an Assembly was set up (November 9, 1879),\r\ncomposed partly of British officers and partly of nominated members. This\r\nwas a complete falsification of a whole set of our national promises.\r\nStill annexation might conceivably have been (M14) accepted, even the\r\nsting might have been partially taken out of the delay of the promised\r\nfree institutions, if only the administration had been considerate,\r\njudicious, and adapted to the ways and habits of the people. Instead of\r\nbeing all these things it was stiff, headstrong, and intensely stupid.(19)\r\n\r\nThe value of the official assurances from agents on the spot that\r\nrestoration of independence would destroy the chances of confederation,\r\nand would give fuel to the fires of agitation, was speedily tested. It was\r\nprecisely these results that flowed from the denial of independence. The\r\nincensed Boer leaders worked so successfully on the Cape parliament\r\nagainst confederation, that this favourite panacea was indefinitely hung\r\nup. Here, again, it is puzzling to know why ministers did not retrace\r\ntheir steps. Here, again, their blind guides in the Transvaal persisted\r\nthat they knew the road; persisted that with the exception of a turbulent\r\nhandful, the Boers of the Transvaal only sighed for the enjoyment of the\r\n_pax britannica_, or, if even that should happen to be not quite true, at\r\nany rate they were incapable of united action, were mortal cowards, and\r\ncould never make a stand in the field. While folly of this kind was\r\nfinding its way by every mail to Downing Street, violent disturbances\r\nbroke out in the collection of taxes. Still Sir Owen Lanyon—who had been\r\nplaced in control in the Transvaal in March 1879—assured Lord Kimberley\r\nthat no serious trouble would arise (November 14). At the end of the month\r\nhe still denies that there is much or any cause for anxiety. In December\r\nseveral thousands of Boers assembled at Paardekraal, declared for the\r\nrestoration of their republic, and a general rising followed. Colley, who\r\nhad succeeded General Wolseley as governor of Natal and high commissioner\r\nfor south-east Africa, had been so little prepared for this, that at the\r\nend of August he had recommended a reduction of the Transvaal\r\ngarrisons,(20) and even now he thought the case so little serious that he\r\ncontented himself (December 4) with ordering four companies to march for\r\nthe Transvaal. Then he and Lanyon began to get alarmed, and with good\r\nreason. The whole country, except three or four beleaguered British posts,\r\nfell into the hands of the Boers.\r\n\r\nThe pleas for failure to take measures to conciliate the Boers in the\r\ninterval between Frere’s recall and the outbreak, were that Sir Hercules\r\nRobinson had not arrived;(21) that confederation was not yet wholly given\r\nup; that resistance to annexation was said to be abating; that time was in\r\nour favour; that the one thing indispensable to conciliate the Boers was a\r\nrailway to Delagoa Bay; that this needed a treaty, and we hoped soon to\r\nget Portugal to ratify a treaty, and then we might tell the Boers that we\r\nshould soon make a survey, with a view at some early date to proceed with\r\nthe project, and thus all would in the end come right. So a fresh page was\r\nturned in the story of loitering unwisdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nOn December 6, Mr. Brand, the sagacious president of the Orange Free\r\nState, sent a message of anxious warning to the acting governor at Cape\r\nTown, urging that means should be devised to avert an imminent collision.\r\nThat message, which might possibly have wakened up the colonial office to\r\nthe real state of the case, did not reach London until December 30.\r\nExcuses for this fatal delay were abundant: a wire was broken; the\r\ngovernor did not think himself concerned with Transvaal affairs; he sent\r\nthe message on to the general, supposing that the general would send it on\r\nhome; and so forth. For a whole string of the very best reasons in the\r\nworld the message that (M15) might have prevented the outbreak, arrived\r\nthrough the slow post at Whitehall just eleven days after the outbreak had\r\nbegun. Members of the legislature at the Cape urged the British government\r\nto send a special commissioner to inquire and report. The policy of giving\r\nconsideration to the counsels of the Cape legislature had usually been\r\npursued by the wiser heads concerned in South African affairs, and when\r\nthe counsels of the chief of the Free State were urgent in the same\r\ndirection, their weight should perhaps have been decisive. Lord Kimberley,\r\nhowever, did not think the moment opportune (Dec. 30).(22) Before many\r\nweeks, as it happened, a commission was indeed sent, but unfortunately not\r\nuntil after the mischief had been done. Meanwhile in the Queen’s speech a\r\nweek later an emphatic paragraph announced that the duty of vindicating\r\nher Majesty’s authority had set aside for the time any plan for securing\r\nto European settlers in the Transvaal full control over their own local\r\naffairs. Seldom has the sovereign been made the mouthpiece of an utterance\r\nmore shortsighted.\r\n\r\nAgain the curtain rose upon a new and memorable act. Four days after the\r\nQueen’s speech, President Brand a second time appeared upon the scene\r\n(Jan. 10, 1881), with a message hoping that an effort would be made\r\nwithout the least delay to prevent further bloodshed. Lord Kimberley\r\nreplied that provided the Boers would desist from their armed opposition,\r\nthe government did not despair of making a satisfactory settlement. Two\r\ndays later (Jan. 12) the president told the government that not a moment\r\nshould be lost, and some one (say Chief Justice de Villiers) should be\r\nsent to the Transvaal burghers by the government, to stop further\r\ncollision and with a clear and definite proposal for a settlement.\r\n“Moments,” he said, “are precious.” For twelve days these precious moments\r\npassed. On Jan. 26 the secretary of state informed the high commissioner\r\nat Cape Town, now Sir Hercules Robinson, that President Brand pressed for\r\nthe offer of terms and conditions to the Boers through Robinson, “provided\r\nthey cease from armed opposition, making it clear to them how this is to\r\nbe understood.” On this suggestion he instructed Robinson to inform Brand\r\nthat if armed opposition should at once cease, the government “would\r\nthereupon endeavour to frame such a scheme as in their belief would\r\nsatisfy all friends of the Transvaal community.” Brand promptly advised\r\nthat the Boers should be told of this forthwith, before the satisfactory\r\narrangements proposed had been made more difficult by further collision.\r\nThis was on Jan. 29. Unhappily on the very day before, the British force\r\nhad been repulsed at Laing’s Nek. Colley, on Jan. 23, had written to\r\nJoubert, calling on the Boer leaders to disperse, informing them that\r\nlarge forces were already arriving from England and India, and assuring\r\nthem that if they would dismiss their followers, he would forward to\r\nLondon any statement of their grievances. It would have been a great deal\r\nmore sensible to wait for an answer. Instead of waiting for an answer\r\nColley attacked (Jan. 28) and was beaten back—the whole proceeding a\r\nrehearsal of a still more disastrous error a month later.\r\n\r\nBrand was now more importunate than ever, earnestly urging on General\r\nColley that the nature of the scheme should be made known to the Boers,\r\nand a guarantee undertaken that if they submitted they would not be\r\ntreated as rebels. “I have replied,” Colley tells Lord Kimberley, “that I\r\ncan give no such assurance, and can add nothing to your words.” In other\r\ncorrespondence he uses grim language about the deserts of some of the\r\nleaders. On this Mr. Gladstone, writing to Lord Kimberley (Feb. 5), says\r\ntruly enough, “Colley with a vengeance counts his chickens before they are\r\nhatched, and his curious letter throws some light backward on the\r\nproceedings in India. His line is singularly wide of ours.” The secretary\r\nof state, finding barrack-room rigidity out of place, directs Colley (Feb.\r\n8) to inform Brand (M16) that the government would be ready to give all\r\nreasonable guarantees as to treatment of Boers after submission, if they\r\nceased from armed opposition, and a scheme would be framed for permanent\r\nfriendly settlement. As it happened, on the day on which this was\r\ndespatched from Downing Street, Colley suffered a second check at the\r\nIngogo River (Feb. 8). Let us note that he was always eager in his\r\nrecognition of the readiness and promptitude of the military support from\r\nthe government at home.(23)\r\n\r\nThen an important move took place from the other quarter. The Boers made\r\ntheir first overture. It came in a letter from Kruger to Colley (Feb. 12).\r\nIts purport was fairly summarised by Colley in a telegram to the colonial\r\nsecretary, and the pith of it was that Kruger and his Boers were so\r\ncertain of the English government being on their side if the truth only\r\nreached them, that they would not fear the result of inquiry by a royal\r\ncommission, and were ready, if troops were ordered to withdraw from the\r\nTransvaal, to retire from their position, and give such a commission a\r\nfree passage. This telegram reached London on Feb. 13th, and on the 15th\r\nit was brought before the cabinet.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone immediately informed the Queen (Feb. 15) that viewing the\r\nlikelihood of early and sanguinary actions, Lord Kimberley thought that\r\nthe receipt of such an overture at such a juncture, although its terms\r\nwere inadmissible, made it a duty to examine whether it afforded any hope\r\nof settlement. The cabinet were still more strongly inclined towards\r\ncoming to terms. Any other decision would have broken up the government,\r\nfor on at least one division in the House on Transvaal affairs Mr. Bright\r\nand Mr. Chamberlain, along with three other ministers not in the cabinet,\r\nhad abstained from voting. Colley was directed (Feb. 16) to inform the\r\nBoers that on their desisting from armed opposition, the government would\r\nbe ready to send commissioners to develop a scheme of settlement, and that\r\nmeanwhile if this proposal were accepted, the English general was\r\nauthorised to agree to the suspension of hostilities. This was in\r\nsubstance a conditional acceptance of the Boer overture.(24) On the same\r\nday the general was told from the war office that, as respected the\r\ninterval before receiving a reply from Mr. Kruger, the government did not\r\nbind his discretion, but “we are anxious for your making arrangements to\r\navoid effusion of blood.” The spirit of these instructions was clear. A\r\nweek later (Feb. 23) the general showed that he understood this, for he\r\nwrote to Mr. Childers that “he would not without strong reason undertake\r\nany operation likely to bring on another engagement, until Kruger’s reply\r\nwas received.”(25) If he had only stood firm to this, a tragedy would have\r\nbeen averted.\r\n\r\nOn receiving the telegram of Feb. 16, Colley was puzzled to know what was\r\nthe meaning of suspending hostilities if armed opposition were abandoned\r\nby the Boers, and he asked the plain question (Feb. 19) whether he was to\r\nleave Laing’s Nek (which was in Natal territory) in Boer occupation, and\r\nour garrisons isolated and short of provisions, or was he to occupy\r\nLaing’s Nek and relieve the garrisons. Colley’s inquiries were instantly\r\nconsidered by the cabinet, and the reply settled. The garrisons were to be\r\nfree to provision themselves and peaceful intercourse allowed; “but,”\r\nKimberley tells Colley, “we do not mean that you should march to the\r\nrelief of garrisons or occupy Laing’s Nek, if the arrangement proceeds.\r\n_Fix reasonable time within which answer must be sent by Boers._”\r\n\r\nOn Feb. 21 Colley despatched a letter to Kruger, stating that on the Boers\r\nceasing from armed opposition, the Queen would appoint a commission. He\r\nadded that “upon this proposal being accepted _within forty-eight hours\r\nfrom the receipt of this letter_,” he was authorised to agree to a\r\nsuspension of hostilities on the part of the British.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\n(M17) In this interval a calamity, destined to be historic, occurred,\r\ntrivial in a military sense, but formidable for many years to come in the\r\nissues moral and political that it raised, and in the passions for which\r\nit became a burning watchword. On the night of Feb. 26, Colley with a\r\nforce of 359 men all told, made up of three different corps, marched out\r\nof his camp and occupied Majuba Hill. The general’s motives for this\r\nprecipitancy are obscure. The best explanation seems to be that he\r\nobserved the Boers to be pushing gradually forward on to advanced ground,\r\nand thought it well, without waiting for Kruger’s reply, to seize a height\r\nlying between the Nek and his own little camp, the possession of which\r\nwould make Laing’s Nek untenable. He probably did not expect that his move\r\nwould necessarily lead to fighting, and in fact when they saw the height\r\noccupied, the Boers did at first for a little time actually begin to\r\nretire from the Nek, though they soon changed their minds.(26) The British\r\noperation is held by military experts to have been rash; proper steps were\r\nnot taken by the general to protect himself upon Majuba, the men were not\r\nwell handled, and the Boers showed determined intrepidity as they climbed\r\nsteadily up the hill from platform to platform, taking from seven in the\r\nmorning (Feb. 27) up to half-past eleven to advance some three thousand\r\nyards and not losing a man, until at last they scaled the crest and poured\r\na deadly fire upon the small British force, driving them headlong from the\r\nsummit, seasoned soldiers though most of them were. The general who was\r\nresponsible for the disaster paid the penalty with his life. Some ninety\r\nothers fell and sixty were taken prisoners.\r\n\r\nAt home the sensation was profound. The hysterical complaints about our\r\nmen and officers, General Wood wrote to Childers, “are more like French\r\ncharacter than English used to be.” Mr. Gladstone and his colleagues had a\r\npolitical question to consider. Colley could not be technically accused of\r\nwant of good faith in moving forward on the 26th, as the time that he had\r\nappointed had expired. But though Majuba is just inside Natal—some four\r\nmiles over the border—his advance was, under the circumstances of the\r\nmoment, essentially an aggressive movement. Could his defeat justify us in\r\nwithdrawing our previous proposals to the Boers? Was a military\r\nmiscarriage, of no magnitude in itself, to be turned into a plea for\r\nabandoning a policy deliberately adopted for what were thought powerful\r\nand decisive reasons? “Suppose, for argument’s sake,” Mr. Gladstone wrote\r\nto Lord Kimberley when the sinister news arrived (Mar. 2), “that at the\r\nmoment when Colley made the unhappy attack on Majuba Hill, there shall\r\nturn out to have been decided on, and possibly on its way, a satisfactory\r\nor friendly reply from the Boer government to your telegram? I fear the\r\nchances may be against this; but if it prove to be the case, we could not\r\nbecause we had failed on Sunday last, insist on shedding more blood.” As\r\nit happened, the Boer answer was decided on before the attack at Majuba,\r\nand was sent to Colley by Kruger at Heidelberg in ignorance of the event,\r\nthe day after the ill-fated general’s death. The members of the Transvaal\r\ngovernment set out their gratitude for the declaration that under certain\r\nconditions the government of the Queen was inclined to cease hostilities;\r\nand expressed their opinion that a meeting of representatives from both\r\nsides would probably lead with all speed to a satisfactory result. This\r\nreply was despatched by Kruger on the day on which Colley’s letter of the\r\n21st came into his hands (Feb. 28), and it reached Colley’s successor on\r\nMarch 7.\r\n\r\nSir Evelyn Wood, now after the death of Colley in chief command,\r\nthroughout recommended military action. Considering the disasters we had\r\nsustained, he thought the happiest result would be that after a successful\r\nbattle, which he hoped to fight in about a fortnight, the Boers would\r\ndisperse without any guarantee, and many now in the field against their\r\nwill would readily settle down. He explained that by happy result, he did\r\nnot mean that a series of actions fought by any six companies could affect\r\nour military prestige, but that a British victory would enable the Boer\r\n(M18) leaders to quench a fire that had got beyond their control. The next\r\nday after this recommendation to fight (March 6), he, of his own motion,\r\naccepted a proposal telegraphed from Joubert at the instigation of the\r\nindefatigable Brand, for a suspension of hostilities for eight days, for\r\nthe purpose of receiving Kruger’s reply. There was a military reason\r\nbehind. General Wood knew that the garrison in Potchefstrom must surrender\r\nunless the place were revictualled, and three other beleaguered garrisons\r\nwere in almost equal danger. The government at once told him that his\r\narmistice was approved. This armistice, though Wood’s reasons were\r\nmilitary rather than diplomatic, virtually put a stop to suggestions for\r\nfurther fighting, for it implied, and could in truth mean nothing else,\r\nthat if Kruger’s reply were promising, the next step would not be a fight,\r\nbut the continuance of negotiation. Sir Evelyn Wood had not advised a\r\nfight for the sake of restoring military prestige, but to make it easier\r\nfor the Boer leaders to break up bands that were getting beyond their\r\ncontrol. There was also present in his mind the intention, if the\r\ngovernment would sanction it, of driving the Boers out of Natal, as soon\r\nas ever he had got his men up across the swollen river. So far from\r\nsanctioning it, the government expressly forbade him to take offensive\r\naction. On March 8, General Wood telegraphed home: “Do not imagine I wish\r\nto fight. I know the attending misery too well. But now you have so many\r\ntroops coming, I recommend decisive though lenient action; and I can,\r\nhumanly speaking, promise victory. Sir G. Colley never engaged more than\r\nsix companies. I shall use twenty and two regiments of cavalry in\r\ndirection known to myself only, and undertake to enforce dispersion.” This\r\nthen was General Wood’s view. On the day before he sent this telegram, the\r\ngeneral already had received Kruger’s reply to the effect that they were\r\nanxious to negotiate, and it would be best for commissioners from the two\r\nsides to meet. It is important to add that the government were at the same\r\ntime receiving urgent warnings from President Brand that Dutch sympathy,\r\nboth in the Cape Colony and in the Orange Free State, with the Dutch in\r\nthe Transvaal was growing dangerous, and that the prolongation of\r\nhostilities would end in a formidable extension of their area.(27) Even in\r\nJanuary Lanyon had told Colley that men from the Free State were in the\r\nfield against him. Three days before Majuba, Lord Kimberley had written to\r\nColley (February 24), “My great fear has been lest the Free State should\r\ntake part against us, or even some movement take place in the Cape Colony.\r\nIf our willingness to come to terms has avoided such a calamity, I shall\r\nconsider it will have been a most important point gained.”(28)\r\n\r\nTwo memoranda for the Queen show the views of the cabinet on the new\r\nposition of affairs:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To the Queen._\r\n\r\n    _March 8, 1881._—The cabinet considered with much care the terms\r\n    of the reply to Sir Evelyn Wood’s telegram reporting (not\r\n    textually) the answer of the Boer leaders to the proposals which\r\n    Sir George Colley had sent to them. They felt justified in\r\n    construing the Boer answer as leaving the way open to the\r\n    appointment of commissioners, according to the telegram previously\r\n    seen and approved by your Majesty. They were anxious to keep the\r\n    question moving in this direction, and under the extreme urgency\r\n    of the circumstances as to time, they have despatched a telegram\r\n    to Sir Evelyn Wood accordingly. Mr. Gladstone has always urged,\r\n    and still feels, that the proposal of the Boers for the\r\n    appointment of commissioners was fortunate on this among other\r\n    grounds, that it involved a recognition of your Majesty’s _de\r\n    facto_ authority in the Transvaal.\r\n\r\n    _March 12._—The cabinet determined, in order to obviate\r\n    misapprehension or suspicion, to desire Sir E. Wood to inform the\r\n    government from what quarter the suggestion of an armistice\r\n    actually proceeded. They agreed that the proper persons to be\r\n    appointed as commissioners were Sir H. Robinson, Sir E. Wood, and\r\n    Mr. De Villiers, chief justice of the Cape; together with Mr.\r\n    Brand of the Free State as _amicus curiæ_, should he be willing to\r\n    lend his good offices in the spirit in which he has hitherto\r\n    acted. The cabinet then considered fully the terms of the\r\n    communication to be made to the Boers by Sir E. Wood. In this,\r\n    which is matter of extreme urgency, they prescribe a time for the\r\n    reply of the Boers not later than the 18th; renew the promise of\r\n    amnesty; require the dispersion of the Boers to their own homes;\r\n    and state the general outlines of the permanent arrangement which\r\n    they would propose for the territory.... The cabinet believe that\r\n    in requiring the dispersion of the Boers to their homes, they will\r\n    have made the necessary provision for the vindication of your\r\n    Majesty’s authority, so as to open the way for considering terms\r\n    of pacific settlement.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 22, under instructions from home, the general concluded an\r\nagreement for peace. The Boers made some preliminary requests to which the\r\ngovernment declined to assent. Their proposal that the commission should\r\nbe joint was rejected; its members were named exclusively by the crown.\r\nThey agreed to withdraw from the Nek and disperse to their homes; we\r\nagreed not to occupy the Nek, and not to follow them up with troops,\r\nthough General Roberts with a large force had sailed for the Cape on March\r\n6. Then the political negotiation went forward. Would it have been wise,\r\nas the question was well put by the Duke of Argyll (not then a member of\r\nthe government), “to stop the negotiation for the sake of defeating a body\r\nof farmers who had succeeded under accidental circumstances and by great\r\nrashness on the part of our commanders, in gaining a victory over us?”\r\nThis was the true point.\r\n\r\nThe parliamentary attack was severe. The galling argument was that\r\ngovernment had conceded to three defeats what they had refused to ten\r\ntimes as many petitions, memorials, remonstrances; and we had given to men\r\nwith arms in their hands what we refused to their peaceful prayers. A\r\ngreat lawyer in the House of Lords made the speech that is expected from a\r\ngreat lawyer who is also a conspicuous party leader; and ministers\r\nundoubtedly exposed an extent of surface that was not easy to defend, not\r\nbecause they had made a peace, but because they had failed to prevent the\r\nrising. High military authorities found a curious plea for going on, in\r\nthe fact that this was our first contest with Europeans since the\r\nbreech-loader came in, and it was desirable to give our troops confidence\r\nin the new-fashioned weapon. Reasons of a very different sort from this\r\nwere needed to overthrow the case for peace. How could the miscarriage at\r\nMajuba, brought on by our own action, warrant us in drawing back from an\r\nengagement already deliberately proffered? Would not such a proceeding,\r\nasked Lord Kimberley, have been little short of an act of bad faith? Or\r\nwere we, in Mr. Gladstone’s language, to say to the Boers, “Although we\r\nmight have treated with you before these military miscarriages, we cannot\r\ndo so now, until we offer up a certain number of victims in expiation of\r\nthe blood that has been shed. Until that has been done, the very things\r\nwhich we believed before to be reasonable, which we were ready to discuss\r\nwith you, we refuse to discuss now, and we must wait until Moloch has been\r\nappeased”? We had opened a door for negotiation; were we to close it\r\nagain, because a handful of our forces had rashly seized a post they could\r\nnot hold? The action of the Boers had been defensive of the _status quo_,\r\nfor if we had established ourselves on Majuba, their camp at Laing’s Nek\r\nwould have been untenable. The minister protested in the face of the House\r\nof Commons that “it would have been most unjust and cruel, it would have\r\nbeen cowardly and mean, if on account of these defensive operations we had\r\nrefused to go forward with the negotiations which, before the first of\r\nthese miscarriages had occurred, we had already declared that we were\r\nwilling to promote and undertake.”(29)\r\n\r\nThe policy of the reversal of annexation is likely to remain a topic of\r\nendless dispute.(30) As Sir Hercules Robinson put (M19) it in a letter to\r\nLord Kimberley, written a week before Majuba (Feb. 21), no possible course\r\nwas free from grave objection. If you determine, he said, to hold by the\r\nannexation of the Transvaal, the country would have to be conquered and\r\nheld in subjection for many years by a large force. Free institutions and\r\nself-government under British rule would be an impossibility. The only\r\npalliative would be to dilute Dutch feeling by extensive English\r\nimmigration, like that of 1820 to the Eastern Province. But that would\r\ntake time, and need careful watching; and in the meantime the result of\r\nholding the Transvaal as a conquered colony would undoubtedly be to excite\r\nbitter hatred between the English and Dutch throughout the Free State and\r\nthis colony, which would be a constant source of discomfort and danger. On\r\nthe other hand, he believed that if they were, after a series of reverses\r\nand before any success, to yield all the Boers asked for, they would be so\r\noverbearing and quarrelsome that we should soon be at war with them again.\r\nOn the whole, Sir Hercules was disposed to think—extraordinary as such a\r\nview must appear—that the best plan would be to re-establish the supremacy\r\nof our arms, and then let the malcontents go. He thought no middle course\r\nany longer practicable. Yet surely this course was open to all the\r\nobjections. To hold on to annexation at any cost was intelligible. But to\r\nface all the cost and all the risks of a prolonged and a widely extended\r\nconflict, with the deliberate intention of allowing the enemy to have his\r\nown way after the conflict had been brought to an end, was not\r\nintelligible and was not defensible.\r\n\r\nSome have argued that we ought to have brought up an overwhelming force,\r\nto demonstrate that we were able to beat them, before we made peace.\r\nUnfortunately demonstrations of this species easily turn into\r\nprovocations, and talk of this kind mostly comes from those who believe,\r\nnot that peace was made in the wrong way, but that a peace giving their\r\ncountry back to the Boers ought never to have been made at all, on any\r\nterms or in any way. This was not the point from which either cabinet or\r\nparliament started. The government had decided that annexation had been an\r\nerror. The Boers had proposed inquiry. The government assented on\r\ncondition that the Boers dispersed. Without waiting a reasonable time for\r\na reply, our general was worsted in a rash and trivial attack. Did this\r\ncancel our proffered bargain? The point was simple and unmistakable,\r\nthough party heat at home, race passion in the colony, and our everlasting\r\nhuman proneness to mix up different questions, and to answer one point by\r\narguments that belong to another, all combined to produce a confusion of\r\nmind that a certain school of partisans have traded upon ever since.\r\nStrange in mighty nations is moral cowardice, disguised as a Roman pride.\r\nAll the more may we admire the moral courage of the minister. For moral\r\ncourage may be needed even where aversion to bloodshed fortunately happens\r\nto coincide with high prudence and sound policy of state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe negotiations proceeded, if negotiation be the right word. The Boers\r\ndisbanded, a powerful British force was encamped on the frontier, no Boer\r\nrepresentative sat on the commission, and the terms of final agreement\r\nwere in fact, as the Boers afterwards alleged, dictated and imposed. Mr.\r\nGladstone watched with a closeness that, considering the tremendous load\r\nof Ireland, parliamentary procedure, and the incessant general business of\r\na prime minister, is amazing. When the Boers were over-pressing, he warned\r\nthem that it was only “the unshorn strength” of the administration that\r\nenabled the English cabinet, rather to the surprise of the world, to spare\r\nthem the sufferings of a war. “We could not,” he said to Lord Kimberley,\r\n“have carried our Transvaal policy, unless we had here a strong\r\ngovernment, and we spent some, if not much, of our strength in carrying\r\nit.” A convention was concluded at Pretoria in (M20) August, recognising\r\nthe quasi-independence of the Transvaal, subject to the suzerainty of the\r\nQueen, and with certain specified reservations. The Pretoria convention of\r\n1881 did not work smoothly. Transvaal affairs were discussed from time to\r\ntime in the cabinet, and Mr. Chamberlain became the spokesman of the\r\ngovernment on a business where he was destined many years after to make so\r\nconspicuous and irreparable a mark. The Boers again sent Kruger to London,\r\nand he made out a good enough case in the opinion of Lord Derby, then\r\nsecretary of state, to justify a fresh arrangement. By the London\r\nconvention of 1884, the Transvaal state was restored to its old title of\r\nthe South African Republic; the assertion of suzerainty in the preamble of\r\nthe old convention did not appear in the new one;(31) and various other\r\nmodifications were introduced—the most important of them, in the light of\r\nlater events, being a provision for white men to have full liberty to\r\nreside in any part of the republic, to trade in it, and to be liable to\r\nthe same taxes only as those exacted from citizens of the republic.\r\n\r\nWhether we look at the Sand River Convention in 1852, which conferred\r\nindependence; or at Shepstone’s proclamation in 1877, which took\r\nindependence away; or at the convention of Pretoria in 1881, which in a\r\nqualified shape gave it back; or at the convention of London in 1884,\r\nwhich qualified the qualification over again, till independence, subject\r\nto two or three specified conditions, was restored,—we can but recall the\r\ncaustic apologue of sage Selden in his table-talk on contracts. “Lady\r\nKent,” he says, “articled with Sir Edward Herbert that he should come to\r\nher when she sent for him, and stay with her as long as she would have\r\nhim; to which he set his hand. Then he articled with her that he should go\r\naway when he pleased, and stay away as long as he pleased; to which she\r\nset her hand. This is the epitome of all the contracts in the world,\r\nbetwixt man and man, betwixt prince and subject.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV. New Phases Of The Irish Revolution. (1880-1882)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The agitation of the Irish land league strikes at the roots of all\r\n    contract, and therefore at the very foundations of modern society;\r\n    but if we would effectually withstand it, we must cease to insist\r\n    on maintaining the forms of free contract where the reality is\r\n    impossible.—T. H. GREEN.(32)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day in 1880 when Lord Beaconsfield was finally quitting the\r\nofficial house in Downing Street, one who had been the ablest and most\r\nzealous supporter of his policy in the press, called to bid him good-bye.\r\nThe visitor talked gloomily of the national prospect; of difficulties with\r\nAustria, with Russia, with the Turk; of the confusions to come upon Europe\r\nfrom the doctrines of Midlothian. The fallen minister listened. Then\r\nlooking at his friend, he uttered in deep tones a single word.\r\n“_Ireland!_” he said.\r\n\r\nIn a speech made in 1882 Mr. Gladstone put the case to the House of\r\nCommons:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The government had to deal with a state of things in Ireland\r\n    entirely different from any that had been known there for fifty\r\n    years.... With a political revolution we have ample strength to\r\n    cope. There is no reason why our cheeks should grow pale, or why\r\n    our hearts should sink, at the idea of grappling with a political\r\n    revolution. The strength of this country is tenfold what is\r\n    required for such a purpose. But a social revolution is a very\r\n    different matter.... The seat and source of the movement was not\r\n    to be found during the time the government was in power. It is to\r\n    be looked for in the foundation of the land league.(33)\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo years later he said at Edinburgh:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I frankly admit I had had much upon my hands connected with the\r\n    doings of the Beaconsfield government in almost every quarter of\r\n    the world, and I did not know, no one knew, the severity of the\r\n    crisis that was already swelling upon the horizon, and that\r\n    shortly after rushed upon us like a flood.(34)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo came upon them by degrees the predominance of Irish affairs and Irish\r\nactivity in the parliament of 1880, which had been chosen without much\r\nreference to Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nA social revolution with the land league for its organ in Ireland, and Mr.\r\nParnell and his party for its organ in parliament, now, in Mr. Gladstone’s\r\nwords, rushed upon him and his government like a flood. The mind of the\r\ncountry was violently drawn from Dulcigno and Thessaly, from Batoum and\r\nErzeroum, from the wild squalor of Macedonia and Armenia to squalor not\r\nless wild in Connaught and Munster, in Mayo, Galway, Sligo, Kerry.\r\nAgrarian agitation on the one hand, parliamentary violence on the other,\r\nwere the two potent weapons by which the Irish revolutionary leader\r\nassailed the misrule of the British garrison as the agents of the British\r\nparliament in his country. This formidable movement slowly unmasked\r\nitself. The Irish government, represented by Mr. Forster in the cabinet,\r\nbegan by allowing the law conferring exceptional powers upon the executive\r\nto lapse. The main reason was want of time to pass a fresh Act. In view of\r\nthe undoubted distress in some parts of Ireland, and of the harshness of\r\ncertain evictions, the government further persuaded the House of Commons\r\nto pass a bill for compensating an evicted tenant on certain conditions,\r\nif the landlord turned him out of his holding. The bill was no easy dose\r\neither for the cabinet or its friends. Lord Lansdowne stirred much\r\ncommotion by retiring from the government, and landowners and capitalists\r\nwere full of consternation. At least one member of the cabinet was\r\nprofoundly uneasy. It is impossible to read the letters of the Duke of\r\nArgyll to Mr. Gladstone on land, church establishment, the Zulu war,\r\nwithout wondering on what theory a cabinet was formed that included him,\r\nable and (M21) upright as he was, along with radicals like Mr.\r\nChamberlain. Before the cabinet was six months old the duke was plucking\r\nMr. Gladstone’s sleeve with some vivacity at the Birmingham language on\r\nIrish land. Mr. Parnell in the committee stage abstained from supporting\r\nthe measure, sixteen liberals voted against the third reading, and the\r\nHouse of Lords, in which nationalist Ireland had not a single\r\nrepresentative, threw out the bill by a majority of 282 against 51. It was\r\nsaid that if all the opposition peers had stayed away, still ministers\r\nwould have been beaten by their own supporters.\r\n\r\nLooking back upon these events, Mr. Gladstone set out in a memorandum of\r\nlater years, that during the session of 1880 the details of the budget\r\ngave him a good deal to do, while the absorbing nature of foreign\r\nquestions before and after his accession to office had withdrawn his\r\nattention from his own Land Act of 1870:(35)—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Late in the session came the decisive and disastrous rejection by\r\n    the House of Lords of the bill by means of which the government\r\n    had hoped to arrest the progress of disorder, and avert the\r\n    necessity for measures in the direction of coercion. The rapid and\r\n    vast extension of agrarian disturbance followed, as was to be\r\n    expected, this wild excess of landlordism, and the Irish\r\n    government proceeded to warn the cabinet that coercive legislation\r\n    would be necessary.\r\n\r\n    Forster allowed himself to be persuaded by the governmental agents\r\n    in Ireland that the root of the evil lay within small compass;\r\n    that there were in the several parishes a certain limited number\r\n    of unreasonable and mischievous men, that these men were known to\r\n    the police, and that if summary powers were confided to the Irish\r\n    government, by the exercise of which these objectionable persons\r\n    might be removed, the evil would die out of itself. I must say I\r\n    never fell into this extraordinary illusion of Forster’s about his\r\n    ’village ruffian.’ But he was a very impracticable man placed in a\r\n    position of great responsibility. He was set upon a method of\r\n    legislation adapted to the erroneous belief that the mischief lay\r\n    only with a very limited number of well-known individuals, that is\r\n    to say, the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act.... Two points of\r\n    difference arose: first, as to the nature of the coercion to be\r\n    used; secondly, as to its time. I insisted that we were bound to\r\n    try what we could do against Parnell under the existing law,\r\n    before asking for extraordinary powers. Both Bright and\r\n    Chamberlain, if I remember right, did very good service in\r\n    protesting against haste, and resisting Forster’s desire to\r\n    anticipate the ordinary session for the purpose of obtaining\r\n    coercive powers. When, however, the argument of time was exhausted\r\n    by the Parnell trial(36) and otherwise, I obtained no support from\r\n    them in regard to the kind of coercion we were to ask. I\r\n    considered it should be done by giving stringency to the existing\r\n    law, but not by abolishing the right to be tried before being\r\n    imprisoned. I felt the pulse of various members of the cabinet,\r\n    among whom I seem to recollect Kimberley and Carlingford, but I\r\n    could obtain no sympathy, and to my dismay both Chamberlain and\r\n    Bright arrived at the conclusion that if there was to be coercion\r\n    at all, which they lamented, there was something simple and\r\n    effective in the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act which made\r\n    such a method preferable to others.(37) I finally acquiesced. It\r\n    may be asked why? My resistance would have broken up the\r\n    government or involved my own retirement. My reason for\r\n    acquiescence was that I bore in mind the special commission under\r\n    which the government had taken office. It related to the foreign\r\n    policy of the country, the whole spirit and effect of which we\r\n    were to reconstruct. This work had not yet been fully\r\n    accomplished, and it seemed to me that the effective prosecution\r\n    of it was our first and highest duty. I therefore submitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the end of November Mr. Gladstone explained to the Queen that the state\r\nof Ireland was menacing; its distinctive character was not so much that of\r\ngeneral insecurity of life, as that of a widespread conspiracy against\r\nproperty. The worst of it was, he said, that the leaders, unlike\r\nO’Connell, failed to denounce crime. The outbreak was not comparable to\r\nthat of 1832. In 1879 homicides were 64 against 242 for the earlier year\r\nof disturbance. But things were bad enough. (M22) In Galway they had a\r\npoliceman for every forty-seven adult males, and a soldier for every\r\nninety-seven. Yet dangerous terrorism was rampant. “During more than\r\nthirty-seven years since I first entered a cabinet,” Mr. Gladstone told\r\nthe Speaker (November 25), “I have hardly known so difficult a question of\r\nadministration, as that of the immediate duty of the government in the\r\npresent state of Ireland. The multitude of circumstances to be taken into\r\naccount must strike every observer. Among these stand the novelty of the\r\nsuspension of Habeas Corpus in a case of agrarian crime stimulated by a\r\npublic society, and the rather serious difficulty of obtaining it; but\r\nmore important than these is the grave doubt whether it would really reach\r\nthe great characteristic evil of the time, namely, the paralysis of most\r\nimportant civil and proprietary rights, and whether the immediate proposal\r\nof a remedy, probably ineffective and even in a coercive sense partial,\r\nwould not seriously damage the prospects of that arduous and comprehensive\r\ntask which without doubt we must undertake when parliament is summoned.”\r\nIn view of considerations of this kind, the awkwardness of directing an\r\nAct of parliament virtually against leaders who were at the moment the\r\nobject of indictment in the Irish law courts; difficulties of time; doubts\r\nas to the case being really made out; doubts as to the efficacy of the\r\nproposed remedy, Mr. Forster did not carry the cabinet, but agreed to\r\ncontinue the experiment of the ordinary law. The experiment was no\r\nsuccess, and coercion accompanied by land reform became the urgent policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opening of the session of 1881 at once brought obstruction into full\r\nview. The Irish took up their position as a party of action. They spoke\r\nincessantly; as Mr. Gladstone put it, “sometimes rising to the level of\r\nmediocrity, and more often grovelling amidst mere trash in unbounded\r\nprofusion.” Obstruction is obstruction all the world over. It was not\r\nquite new at Westminster, but it was new on this scale. Closure proposals\r\nsprang up like mushrooms. Liberal members with a historical bent ran\r\nprivately to the Speaker with ancient precedents of dictatorial powers\r\nasserted by his official ancestors, and they exhorted him to revive them.\r\n\r\nMr. Forster brought in his bill. Its scope may be described in a sentence.\r\nIt practically enabled the viceroy to lock up anybody he pleased, and to\r\ndetain him as long as he pleased, while the Act remained in force.(38) The\r\ndebate for leave to introduce the bill lasted several days, without any\r\nsign of coming to an end. Here is the Speaker’s account of his own\r\nmemorable act in forcing a close:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Monday, Jan. 31._—The House was boiling over with indignation at\r\n    the apparent triumph of obstruction, and Mr. _G_., yielding to the\r\n    pressure of his friends, committed himself unwisely, as I thought,\r\n    to a continuous sitting on this day in order to force the bill\r\n    through its first stage.\r\n\r\n    On Tuesday, after a sitting of twenty-four hours, I saw plainly\r\n    that this attempt to carry the bill by continuous sitting would\r\n    fail, the Parnell party being strong in numbers, discipline, and\r\n    organisation, and with great gifts of speech. I reflected on the\r\n    situation, and came to the conclusion that it was my duty to\r\n    extricate the House from the difficulty by closing the debate of\r\n    my own authority, and so asserting the undoubted will of the House\r\n    against a rebellious minority. I sent for Mr. G. on Tuesday (Feb.\r\n    1), about noon, and told him that I should be prepared to put the\r\n    question in spite of obstruction on the following conditions: 1.\r\n    That the debate should be carried on until the following morning,\r\n    my object in this delay being to mark distinctly to the outside\r\n    world the extreme gravity of the situation, and the necessity of\r\n    the step which I was about to take. 2. That he should reconsider\r\n    the regulation of business, either by giving more authority to the\r\n    House, or by conferring authority on the Speaker.\r\n\r\n    He agreed to these conditions, and summoned a meeting of the\r\n    cabinet, which assembled in my library at four P.M. on Tuesday\r\n    while the House was sitting, and I was in the chair. At that\r\n    meeting the resolution as to business assumed the shape in which\r\n    it finally appeared on the following Thursday, it having been\r\n    previously considered at former meetings of the cabinet. I\r\n    arranged with Playfair to take the chair on Tuesday night about\r\n    midnight, engaging to resume it on Wednesday morning at nine.\r\n    Accordingly at nine I took the chair, Biggar being in possession\r\n    of the House. I rose, and he resumed his seat. I proceeded with my\r\n    address as concerted with May, and when I had concluded I put the\r\n    question. The scene was most dramatic; but all passed off without\r\n    disturbance, the Irish party on the second division retiring under\r\n    protest.\r\n\r\n    I had communicated, with Mr. G.’s approval, my intention to close\r\n    the debate to Northcote, but to no one else, except May, from whom\r\n    I received much assistance. Northcote was startled, but expressed\r\n    no disapproval of the course proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo ended the memorable sitting of January 31. At noon, on February 2, the\r\nHouse assembled in much excitement. The question was put challenging the\r\nSpeaker’s conduct. “I answered,” he says, “on the spur of the moment that\r\nI had acted on my own responsibility, and from a sense of duty to the\r\nHouse. I never heard such loud and protracted cheering, none cheering more\r\nloudly than Gladstone.” “The Speaker’s firmness in mind,” Mr. Gladstone\r\nreported to the Queen, “his suavity in manner, his unwearied patience, his\r\nincomparable temper, under a thousand provocations, have rendered possible\r\na really important result.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter coercion came a land bill, and here Mr. Gladstone once more\r\ndisplayed his unequalled mastery of legislative skill and power. He had to\r\nexplain and be ready to explain again and again, what he told Lord\r\nSelborne was “the most difficult measure he had ever known to come under\r\nthe detailed consideration of a cabinet.” It was no affair this time of\r\nspeeches out of a railway carriage, or addressed to excited multitudes in\r\nvast halls. That might be, if you so pleased, “the empty verbosity of\r\nexuberant rhetoric”; but nobody could say that of the contest over the\r\ncomplexities of Irish tenure, against the clever and indomitable Irish\r\nexperts who fought under the banner of Mr. Parnell. Northcote was not far\r\nwrong when he said that though the bill was carried by two to one, there\r\nwas hardly a man in the House beyond the Irish ranks who cared a straw\r\nabout it. Another critic said that if the prime minister had asked the\r\nHouse to pass the _Koran_ or the _Nautical Almanac_ as a land bill, he\r\nwould have met no difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe history of the session was described as the carriage of a single\r\nmeasure by a single man. Few British members understood it, none mastered\r\nit. The whigs were disaffected about it, the radicals doubted it, the\r\ntories thought that property as a principle was ruined by it, the\r\nIrishmen, when the humour seized them, bade him send the bill to line\r\ntrunks. Mr. Gladstone, as one observer truly says, “faced difficulties\r\nsuch as no other bill of this country has ever encountered, difficulties\r\nof politics and difficulties of law, difficulties of principle and\r\ndifficulties of detail, difficulties of party and difficulties of\r\npersonnel, difficulties of race and difficulties of class, and he has\r\nnever once failed, or even seemed to fail, in his clear command of the\r\nquestion, in his dignity and authority of demeanour, in his impartiality\r\nin accepting amending suggestions, in his firmness in resisting\r\ndestructive suggestions, in his clear perception of his aim, and his\r\nstrong grasp of the fitting means. And yet it is hardly possible to\r\nappreciate adequately the embarrassments of the situation.”\r\n\r\nEnough has already been said of the legislation of 1870, and its\r\nestablishment of the principle that Irish land is not the subject of an\r\nundivided ownership, but a partnership.(39) The act of 1870 failed because\r\nit had too many exceptions and limitations; because in administration the\r\ncompensation to the tenant for disturbance was inadequate; and because it\r\ndid not fix the cultivator in his holding. Things had now ripened. The\r\nRichmond Commission shortly before had pointed to a court for fixing\r\nrents; that is, for settling the terms of the partnership. A commission\r\nnominated by Mr. Gladstone and presided over by Lord Bessborough had\r\nreported early in 1881 in favour not only of fair rents to be settled by a\r\ntribunal, but of fixity of tenure or the right of (M23) the tenant to\r\nremain in his holding if he paid his rent, and of free sale; that is, his\r\nright to part with his interest. These “three F’s” were the substance of\r\nthe legislation of 1881.\r\n\r\nRents could not be paid, and landlords either would not or could not\r\nreduce them. In the deepest interests of social order, and in confirmation\r\nof the tenant’s equitable and customary ownership, the only course open to\r\nthe imperial legislature was to erect machinery for fixing fair rents. The\r\nalternative to what became matter of much objurgation as dual ownership,\r\nwas a single ownership that was only a short name for allowing the\r\nlandlord to deal as he liked with the equitable interest of the tenant.\r\nWithout the machinery set up by Mr. Gladstone, there could be no security\r\nfor the protection of the cultivator’s interest. What is more, even in\r\nview of a wide and general extension of the policy of buying out the\r\nlandlord and turning the tenant into single owner, still a process of\r\nvaluation for purposes of fair price would have been just as\r\nindispensable, as under the existing system was the tiresome and costly\r\nprocess of valuation for purposes of fair rent. It is true that if the\r\npolicy of purchase had been adopted, this process would have been\r\nperformed once for all. But opinion was not nearly ready either in England\r\nor Ireland for general purchase. And as Mr. Gladstone had put it to Bright\r\nin 1870, to turn a little handful of occupiers into owners would not have\r\ntouched the fringe of the case of the bulk of the Irish cultivators, then\r\nundergoing acute mischief and urgently crying for prompt relief. Mr.\r\nBright’s idea of purchase, moreover, assumed that the buyer would come\r\nwith at least a quarter of the price in his hand,—an assumption not\r\nconsistent with the practical possibilities of the case.\r\n\r\nThe legislation of 1881 no doubt encountered angry criticism from the\r\nEnglish conservative, and little more than frigid approval from the Irish\r\nnationalist. It offended the fundamental principle of the landlords; its\r\nadministration and the construction of some of its leading provisions by\r\nthe courts disappointed and irritated the tenant party. Nevertheless any\r\nattempt in later times to impair the authority of the Land Act of 1881\r\nbrought the fact instantly to light, that the tenant knew it to be the\r\nfundamental charter of his redemption from worse than Egyptian bondage. In\r\nmeasuring this great agrarian law, not only by parliamentary force and\r\nlegislative skill and power, but by the vast and abiding depth of its\r\nsocial results, both direct and still more indirect, many will be disposed\r\nto give it the highest place among Mr. Gladstone’s achievements as\r\nlawmaker.\r\n\r\nFault has sometimes been found with Mr. Gladstone for not introducing his\r\nbill in the session of 1880. If this had been done, it is argued, Ireland\r\nwould have been appeased, no coercion would have been necessary, and we\r\nshould have been spared disastrous parliamentary exasperations and all the\r\nother mischiefs and perils of the quarrel between England and Ireland that\r\nfollowed. Criticism of this kind overlooks three facts. Neither Mr.\r\nGladstone nor Forster nor the new House of Commons was at all ready in\r\n1880 to accept the Three F’s. Second, the Bessborough commission had not\r\ntaken its evidence, and made its momentous report. Third, this argument\r\nassumes motives in Mr. Parnell, that probably do not at all cover the\r\nwhole ground of his policy. As it happened, I called on Mr. Gladstone one\r\nmorning early in 1881. “You have heard,” I asked, “that the Bessborough\r\ncommission are to report for the Three F’s?” “I have not heard,” he said;\r\n“it is incredible!” As so often comes to pass in politics, it was only a\r\nstep from the incredible to the indispensable. But in 1880 the\r\nindispensable was also the impossible. It was the cruel winter of 1880-1\r\nthat made much difference.\r\n\r\nIn point of endurance the session was one of the most remarkable on\r\nrecord. The House of Commons sat 154 days and for 1400 hours; some 240 of\r\nthese hours were after midnight. Only three times since the Reform bill\r\nhad the House sat for more days; only once, in 1847, had the total number\r\nof hours been exceeded and that only by seven, and never before had the\r\nHouse sat so many hours after midnight. On the Coercion bill the House sat\r\ncontinuously once for 22 hours, and once for 41. The debates on the Land\r\nbill took up 58 sittings, and the Coercion bill 22. No such length of\r\ndiscussion, Mr. Gladstone told the Queen, (M24) was recorded on any\r\nmeasure since the committee on the first Reform bill. The Reform bill of\r\n1867 was the only measure since 1843 that took as many as 35 days of\r\ndebate. The Irish Church bill took 21 days and the Land bill of 1870 took\r\n25. Of the 14,836 speeches delivered, 6315 were made by Irish members. The\r\nSpeaker and chairman of committees interposed on points of order nearly\r\n2000 times during the session. Mr. Parnell, the Speaker notes, “with his\r\nminority of 24 dominates the House. When will the House take courage and\r\nreform its procedure?” After all, the suspension of _habeas corpus_ is a\r\nthing that men may well think it worth while to fight about, and a\r\nrevolution in a country’s land-system might be expected to take up a good\r\ndeal of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt soon appeared that no miracle had been wrought by either Coercion Act\r\nor Land Act. Mr. Parnell drew up test cases for submission to the new land\r\ncourt. His advice to the army of tenants would depend, he said, on the\r\nfate of these cases. In September Mr. Forster visited Hawarden, and gave a\r\nbad account of the real meaning of Mr. Parnell’s plausible propositions\r\nfor sending test cases to the newly established land commission, as well\r\nas of other ugly circumstances. “It is quite clear as you said,” wrote Mr.\r\nGladstone to Forster in Ireland, “that Parnell means to present cases\r\nwhich the commission must refuse, and then to treat their refusal as\r\nshowing that they cannot be trusted, and that the bill has failed.” As he\r\ninterpreted it afterwards, there was no doubt that in one sense the Land\r\nAct tended to accelerate a crisis in Ireland, for it brought to a head the\r\naffairs of the party connected with the land league. It made it almost a\r\nnecessity for that party either to advance or to recede. They chose the\r\ndesperate course. At the same date, he wrote in a letter to Lord\r\nGranville:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    With respect to Parnellism, I should not propose to do more than a\r\n    severe and strong denunciation of it by severing him altogether\r\n    from the Irish people and the mass of the Irish members, and by\r\n    saying that home rule has for one of its aims local government—an\r\n    excellent thing to which I would affix no limits except the\r\n    supremacy of the imperial parliament, and the rights of all parts\r\n    of the country to claim whatever might be accorded to Ireland.\r\n    This is only a repetition of what I have often said before, and I\r\n    have nothing to add or enlarge. But I have the fear that when the\r\n    occasion for action comes, which will not be in my time, many\r\n    liberals may perhaps hang back and may cause further trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of what was to come four years later, one of his letters to\r\nForster is interesting (April 12, 1882), among other reasons as\r\nillustrating the depth to which the essence of political liberalism had\r\nnow penetrated Mr. Gladstone’s mind:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. About local government for Ireland, the ideas which more and\r\n    more establish themselves in my mind are such as these.\r\n\r\n    (1.) Until we have seriously responsible bodies to deal with us in\r\n    Ireland, every plan we frame comes to Irishmen, say what we may,\r\n    as an English plan. As such it is probably condemned. At best it\r\n    is a one-sided bargain, which binds us, not them.\r\n\r\n    (2.) If your excellent plans for obtaining local aid towards the\r\n    execution of the law break down, it will be on account of this\r\n    miserable and almost total want of the sense of responsibility for\r\n    the public good and public peace in Ireland; and this\r\n    responsibility we cannot create except through local\r\n    self-government.\r\n\r\n    (3.) If we say we must postpone the question till the state of the\r\n    country is more fit for it, I should answer that the least danger\r\n    is in going forward at once. It is liberty alone which fits men\r\n    for liberty. This proposition, like every other in politics, has\r\n    its bounds; but it is far safer than the counter doctrine, wait\r\n    till they are fit.\r\n\r\n    (4.) In truth I should say (differing perhaps from many), that for\r\n    the Ireland of to-day, the first question is the rectification of\r\n    the relations between landlord and tenant, which happily is going\r\n    on; the next is to relieve Great Britain from the enormous weight\r\n    of the government of Ireland unaided by the people, and from the\r\n    hopeless contradiction in which we stand while we give a\r\n    parliamentary representation, hardly effective for anything but\r\n    mischief without the local institutions of self-government which\r\n    it presupposes, and on which alone it can have a sound and healthy\r\n    basis.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have before us in administration, he wrote to Forster in September—\r\n\r\n\r\n    a problem not less delicate and arduous than the problem of\r\n    legislation with which we have lately had to deal in parliament.\r\n    Of the leaders, the officials, the skeleton of the land league I\r\n    have no hope whatever. The better the prospects of the Land Act\r\n    with their adherents outside the circle of wire-pullers, and with\r\n    the Irish people, the more bitter will be their hatred, and the\r\n    more sure they will be to go as far as fear of the people will\r\n    allow them in keeping up the agitation, which they cannot afford\r\n    to part with on account of their ulterior ends. All we can do is\r\n    to turn more and more the masses of their followers, to fine them\r\n    down by good laws and good government, and it is in this view that\r\n    the question of judicious releases from prison, should improving\r\n    statistics of crime encourage it, may become one of early\r\n    importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in the autumn of 1881 that Mr. Gladstone visited Leeds, in payment\r\nof the debt of gratitude due for his triumphant return in the general\r\nelection of the year before. This progress extended over four days, and\r\nalmost surpassed in magnitude and fervour any of his experiences in other\r\nparts of the kingdom. We have an interesting glimpse of the physical\r\neffort of such experiences in a couple of his letters written to Mr.\r\nKitson, who with immense labour and spirit had organized this severe if\r\nglorious enterprise:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Hawarden Castle, Sept. 28, 1881._—I thank you for the very clear\r\n    and careful account of the proposed proceedings at Leeds. It lacks\r\n    as yet that _rough_ statement of numbers at each meeting, which is\r\n    requisite to enable me to understand what I shall have to do. This\r\n    will be fixed by the scale of the meeting. I see no difficulty but\r\n    one—a procession through the principal thoroughfares is one of the\r\n    most exhausting processes I know as a _preliminary_ to addressing\r\n    a mass meeting. A mass meeting requires the physical powers to be\r\n    in their best and freshest state, as far as anything can be fresh\r\n    in a man near seventy-two; and I have on one or more former\r\n    occasions felt them wofully contracted. In Midlothian I never had\r\n    anything of the kind before a great physical effort in speaking;\r\n    and the lapse even of a couple of years is something. It would\r\n    certainly be most desirable to have the mass meeting first, and\r\n    then I have not any fear at all of the procession through whatever\r\n    thoroughfares you think fit.\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 2, 1881._—I should be very sorry to put aside any of the\r\n    opportunities of vision at Leeds which the public may care to use;\r\n    but what I had hoped was that these might come _after_ any\r\n    speeches of considerable effort and not _before_ them. To\r\n    understand what a physical drain, and what a reaction from tension\r\n    of the senses is caused by a “progress” before addressing a great\r\n    audience, a person must probably have gone through it, and gone\r\n    through it at my time of life. When I went to Midlothian, I begged\r\n    that this might never happen; and it was avoided throughout. Since\r\n    that time I have myself been sensible for the first time of a\r\n    diminished power of voice in the House of Commons, and others also\r\n    for the first time have remarked it.\r\n\r\n\r\nVast torchlight processions, addresses from the corporation, four score\r\naddresses from political bodies, a giant banquet in the Cloth Hall Yard\r\ncovered in for the purpose, on one day; on another, more addresses, a\r\npublic luncheon followed by a mass meeting of over five-and-twenty\r\nthousand persons, then a long journey through dense throngs vociferous\r\nwith an exultation that knew no limits, a large dinner party, and at the\r\nend of all a night train. The only concessions that the veteran asked to\r\nweakness of the flesh, were that at the banquet he should not appear until\r\nthe eating and drinking were over, and that at the mass meeting some\r\npreliminary speakers should intervene to give him time to take breath\r\nafter his long and serious exercises of the morning. When the time came\r\nhis voice was heard like the note of a clear and deep-toned bell. So much\r\nhad vital energy, hardly less rare than his mental power, to do with the\r\nvaried exploits of this spacious career.\r\n\r\nThe topics of his Leeds speeches I need not travel over. (M25) What\r\nattracted most attention and perhaps drew most applause was his warning to\r\nMr. Parnell. “He desires,” said the minister, “to arrest the operation of\r\nthe Land Act; to stand as Moses stood between the living and the dead; to\r\nstand there not as Moses stood, to arrest, but to spread the plague.” The\r\nmenace that followed became a catchword of the day: “If it shall appear\r\nthat there is still to be fought a final conflict in Ireland between law\r\non the one side and sheer lawlessness upon the other, if the law purged\r\nfrom defect and from any taint of injustice is still to be repelled and\r\nrefused, and the first conditions of political society to remain\r\nunfulfilled, then I say, gentlemen, without hesitation, the resources of\r\ncivilisation against its enemies are not yet exhausted.”(40)\r\n\r\nNor was the pageant all excitement. The long speech, which by way of\r\nprelusion to the great mass meeting he addressed to the chamber of\r\ncommerce, was devoted to the destruction of the economic sophisters who\r\ntried to persuade us that “the vampire of free-trade was insidiously\r\nsucking the life-blood of the country.” In large survey of broad social\r\nfacts, exposition of diligently assorted figures, power of scientific\r\nanalysis, sustained chain of reasoning, he was never better. The\r\nconsummate mastery of this argumentative performance did not slay a heresy\r\nthat has nine lives, but it drove the thing out of sight in Yorkshire for\r\nsome time to come.(41)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday October 12, the cabinet met, and after five hours of\r\ndeliberation decided that Mr. Parnell should be sent to prison under the\r\nCoercion Act. The Irish leader was arrested at his hotel the next morning,\r\nand carried off to Kilmainham, where he remained for some six months. The\r\nsame day Mr. Gladstone was presented with an address from the Common\r\nCouncil of London, and in his speech at the Guildhall gave them the news:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Our determination has been that to the best of our power, our\r\n    words should be carried into acts [referring to what he had said\r\n    at Leeds], and even within these few moments I have been informed\r\n    that towards the vindication of law and order, of the rights of\r\n    property, of the freedom of the land, of the first elements of\r\n    political life and civilisation, the first step has been taken in\r\n    the arrest of the man who unhappily from motives which I do not\r\n    challenge, which I cannot examine and with which I have nothing to\r\n    do, has made himself beyond all others prominent in the attempt to\r\n    destroy the authority of the law, and to substitute what would end\r\n    in being nothing more or less than anarchical oppression exercised\r\n    upon the people of Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe arrest of Mr. Parnell was no doubt a pretty considerable strain upon\r\npowers conferred by parliament to put down village ruffians; but times\r\nwere revolutionary, and though the Act of parliament was not a wise one,\r\nbut altogether the reverse of wise, it was no wonder that having got the\r\ninstrument, ministers thought they might as well use it. Still executive\r\nviolence did not seem to work, and Mr. Gladstone looked in a natural\r\ndirection for help in the milder way of persuasion. He wrote (December\r\n17th) to Cardinal Newman:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I will begin with defining strictly the limits of this appeal. I\r\n    ask you to read the inclosed papers; and to consider whether you\r\n    will write anything to Rome upon them. I do not ask you to write,\r\n    nor to tell me whether you write, nor to make any reply to this\r\n    letter, beyond returning the inclosures in an envelope to me in\r\n    Downing Street. I will state briefly the grounds of my request,\r\n    thus limited. In 1844, when I was young as a cabinet minister, and\r\n    the government of Sir R. Peel was troubled with the O’Connell\r\n    manifestations, they made what I think was an appeal to Pope\r\n    Gregory XVI. for his intervention to discourage agitation in\r\n    Ireland. I should be very loath now to tender such a request at\r\n    Rome. But now a different case arises. Some members of the Roman\r\n    catholic priesthood in Ireland deliver certain sermons and\r\n    otherwise express themselves in the way which my inclosures\r\n    exhibit. I doubt whether if they were laymen we should not have\r\n    settled their cases by putting them into gaol. I need not describe\r\n    the sentiments uttered. Your eminence will feel them and judge\r\n    them as strongly as I do. But now as to the Supreme Pontiff. You\r\n    will hardly be surprised when I say that I regard him, if apprised\r\n    of the facts, as responsible for the conduct of these priests. For\r\n    I know perfectly well that he has the means of silencing them; and\r\n    that, if any one of them were in public to dispute the decrees of\r\n    the council of 1870 as plainly as he has denounced law and order,\r\n    he would be silenced.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Errington, who is at Rome, will I believe have seen these\r\n    papers, and will I hope have brought the facts as far as he is\r\n    able to the knowledge of his holiness. But I do not know how far\r\n    he is able; nor how he may use his discretion. He is not our\r\n    official servant, but an independent Roman catholic gentleman and\r\n    a volunteer.\r\n\r\n    My wish is as regards Ireland, in this hour of her peril and her\r\n    hope, to leave nothing undone by which to give heart and strength\r\n    to the hope and to abate the peril. But my wish as regards the\r\n    Pope is that he should have the means of bringing those for whom\r\n    he is responsible to fulfil the elementary duties of citizenship.\r\n    I say of citizenship; of Christianity, of priesthood, it is not\r\n    for me to speak.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cardinal replied that he would gladly find himself able to be of\r\nservice, however slight it might be, in a political crisis which must be\r\nfelt as of grave anxiety by all who understand the blessing of national\r\nunity and peace. He thought Mr. Gladstone overrated the pope’s power in\r\npolitical and social matters. Absolute in questions of theology, it was\r\nnot so in political matters. If the contest in Ireland were whether\r\n“rebellion” or whether “robbery” was a sin, we might expect him to\r\nanathematise its denial. But his action in concrete matters, as whether a\r\npolitical party is censurable or not, was not direct, and only in the long\r\nrun effective. Local power and influence was often a match for Roman\r\nright. The pope’s right keeps things together, it checks extravagances,\r\nand at length prevails, but not without a fight. Its exercise is a matter\r\nof great prudence, and depends upon times and circumstances. As for the\r\nintemperate dangerous words of priests and curates, surely such persons\r\nbelonged to their respective bishops, and scarcely required the\r\nintroduction of the Supreme Authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at April 1882. The reports brought to the cabinet by\r\nMr. Forster were of the gloomiest. The Land Act had brought no\r\nimprovement. In the south-west and many of the midland counties\r\nlawlessness and intimidation were worse than ever. Returns of agrarian\r\ncrime were presented in every shape, and comparisons framed by weeks, by\r\nmonths, by quarters; do what the statisticians would, and in spite of\r\nfluctuations, murders and other serious outrages had increased. The policy\r\nof arbitrary arrest had completely failed, and the officials and crown\r\nlawyers at the Castle were at their wits’ end.\r\n\r\nWhile the cabinet was face to face with this ugly prospect, Mr. Gladstone\r\nreceived a communication volunteered by an Irish member, as to the new\r\nattitude of Mr. Parnell and the possibility of turning it to good account.\r\nMr. Gladstone sent this letter on to Forster, replying meanwhile “in the\r\nsense of not shutting the door.” When the thing came before the cabinet,\r\nMr. Chamberlain—who had previously told Mr. Gladstone that he thought the\r\ntime opportune for something like a reconciliation with the Irish\r\nparty—with characteristic courage took his life in his hands, as he put\r\nit, and set to work to ascertain through the emissary what use for the\r\npublic good could be made of Mr. Parnell’s changed frame of mind. On April\r\n25th, the cabinet heard what Mr. Chamberlain had to tell them, and it came\r\nto this, that Mr. Parnell was desirous to use his influence on behalf of\r\npeace, but his influence for good depended on the settlement of the\r\nquestion of arrears. Ministers decided that they could enter into no\r\nagreement and would give no pledge. They would act on their own\r\nresponsibility in the light of the knowledge they had gained of Mr.\r\nParnell’s views. Mr. Gladstone was always impatient of any reference to\r\n“reciprocal assurances” or “tacit understanding” in respect of the\r\ndealings with the prisoner in Kilmainham. Still the nature of the\r\nproceedings was plain enough. The object of the communications to which\r\nthe government were invited by Mr. Parnell through his emissary, was,\r\nsupposing him to be anxious to do what (M26) he could for law and order,\r\nto find out what action on the part of the government would enable him to\r\nadopt this line.\r\n\r\nEvents then moved rapidly. Rumours that something was going on got abroad,\r\nand questions began to be put in parliament. A stout tory gave notice of a\r\nmotion aiming at the release of the suspects. As Mr. Gladstone informed\r\nthe Queen, there was no doubt that the general opinion of the public was\r\nmoving in a direction adverse to arbitrary imprisonment, though the\r\nquestion was a nice one for consideration whether the recent surrender by\r\nthe no-rent party of its extreme and most subversive contentions, amounted\r\nto anything like a guarantee for their future conduct in respect of peace\r\nand order. The rising excitement was swelled by the retirement of Lord\r\nCowper from the viceroyalty, and the appointment as his successor of Lord\r\nSpencer, who had filled that post in Mr. Gladstone’s first government. On\r\nMay 2nd, Mr. Gladstone read a memorandum to the cabinet to which they\r\nagreed:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The cabinet are of opinion that the time has now arrived when with\r\n    a view to the interests of law and order in Ireland, the three\r\n    members of parliament who have been imprisoned on suspicion since\r\n    last October, should be immediately released; and that the list of\r\n    suspects should be examined with a view to the release of all\r\n    persons not believed to be associated with crimes. They propose at\r\n    once to announce to parliament their intention to propose, as soon\r\n    as necessary business will permit, a bill to strengthen the\r\n    ordinary law in Ireland for the security of life and property,\r\n    while reserving their discretion with regard to the Life and\r\n    Property Protection Act [of 1881], which however they do not at\r\n    present think it will be possible to renew, if a favourable state\r\n    of affairs shall prevail in Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this proceeding Mr. Forster dissented, and he resigned his office.\r\nHis point seems to have been that no suspect should be released until the\r\nnew Coercion Act had been fashioned, whereas the rest of the cabinet held\r\nthat there was no excuse for the continued detention under arbitrary\r\nwarrant of men as to whom the ground for the “reasonable suspicion”\r\nrequired by the law had now disappeared. He probably felt that the\r\nappointment of a viceroy of cabinet rank and with successful Irish\r\nexperience was in fact his own supersession. “I have received your\r\nletter,” Mr. Gladstone wrote to him (May 2), “with much grief, but on this\r\nit would be selfish to expatiate. I have no choice; followed or not\r\nfollowed I must go on. There are portions of the subject which touch you\r\npersonally, and which seem to me to deserve _much_ attention. But I have\r\nsuch an interest in the main issue, that I could not be deemed impartial;\r\nso I had better not enter on them. One thing, however, I wish to say. You\r\nwish to minimise in any further statement the cause of your retreat. In my\r\nopinion—_and I speak from experience_—viewing the nature of that course,\r\nyou will find this hardly possible. For a justification you, I fear, will\r\nhave to found upon the doctrine of ‘a new departure.’ We must protest\r\nagainst it, and deny it with heart and soul.”\r\n\r\nThe way in which Mr. Gladstone chose to put things was stated in a letter\r\nto the Queen (May 3): “In his judgment there had been two, and only two,\r\nvital powers of commanding efficacy in Ireland, the Land Act, and the land\r\nleague; they had been locked in a combat of life and death; and the\r\ncardinal question was which of the two would win. From the serious effort\r\nto amend the Land Act by the Arrears bill of the nationalists,(42) from\r\nthe speeches made in support of it, and from information voluntarily\r\ntendered to the government as to the views of the leaders of the league,\r\nthe cabinet believed that those who governed the land league were now\r\nconscious of having been defeated by the Land Act on the main question,\r\nthat of paying rent.”\r\n\r\nFor the office of Irish secretary Mr. Gladstone selected Lord Frederick\r\nCavendish, who was the husband of a niece of Mrs. Gladstone’s, and one of\r\nthe most devoted of his friends and adherents. The special reason for the\r\nchoice of this capable and high-minded man, was that Lord Frederick had\r\nframed a plan of finance at the treasury for a new scheme of land\r\npurchase. The two freshly appointed Irish ministers at once crossed over\r\nto a country seething in disorder. The (M27) afternoon of the fatal sixth\r\nof May was passed by the new viceroy and Lord Frederick in that grim\r\napartment in Dublin Castle, where successive secretaries spend unshining\r\nhours in saying No to impossible demands, and hunting for plausible\r\nanswers to insoluble riddles. Never did so dreadful a shadow overhang it\r\nas on that day. The task on which the two ministers were engaged was the\r\nconsideration of the new provisions for coping with disorder, which had\r\nbeen prepared in London. The under-secretary, Mr. Burke, and one of the\r\nlawyers, were present. Lord Spencer rode out to the park about five\r\no’clock, and Lord Frederick followed him an hour later. He was overtaken\r\nby the under-secretary walking homewards, and as the two strolled on\r\ntogether, they were both brutally murdered in front of the vice-regal\r\nresidence. The assassins did not know who Lord Frederick was. Well has it\r\nbeen said that Ireland seems the sport of a destiny that is aimless.(43)\r\n\r\nThe official world of London was on that Saturday night in the full round\r\nof its pleasures. The Gladstones were dining at the Austrian embassy. So,\r\ntoo, was Sir William Harcourt, and to him as home secretary the black\r\ntidings were sent from Dublin late in the evening. Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone\r\nhad already left, she for a party at the admiralty, he walking home to\r\nDowning Street. At the admiralty they told her of bad news from Ireland\r\nand hurried her away. Mr. Gladstone arrived at home a few minutes after\r\nher. When his secretary in the hall told him of the horrible thing that\r\nhad been done, it was as if he had been felled to the ground. Then they\r\nhastened to bear what solace they could, to the anguish-stricken home\r\nwhere solace would be so sorely needed.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this blind and hideous crime was at once to arrest the\r\nspirit and the policy of conciliation. While the Irish leaders were locked\r\nup, a secret murder club had taken matters in hand in their own way, and\r\nripened plots within a stone’s throw of the Castle. No worse blow could\r\nhave been struck at Mr. Parnell’s policy. It has been said that the\r\nnineteenth century had seen the course of its history twenty-five times\r\ndiverted by actual or attempted crime. In that sinister list the murders\r\nin the Phoenix Park have a tragic place.\r\n\r\nThe voice of party was for the moment hushed. Sir Stafford Northcote wrote\r\na letter of admirable feeling, saying that if there was any way in which\r\nMr. Gladstone thought they could serve the government, he would of course\r\nlet them know. The Prince of Wales wrote of his own horror and indignation\r\nat the crime, and of his sympathy with Mr. Gladstone in the loss of one\r\nwho was not only a colleague of many merits, but a near connection and\r\ndevoted friend. With one or two scandalous exceptions, the tone of the\r\nEnglish press was sober, sensible, and self-possessed. “If a nation,” said\r\na leading journal in Paris, “should be judged by the way in which it acts\r\non grave occasions, the spectacle offered by England is calculated to\r\nproduce a high opinion of the political character and spirit of the\r\nBritish people.” Things of the baser sort were not quite absent, but they\r\ndid not matter. An appeal confronted the electors of the North-West Riding\r\nas they went to the poll at a bye-election a few days later, to “Vote for\r\n——, and avenge the death of Lord Frederick Cavendish!” They responded by\r\nplacing ——’s opponent at the head of the poll by a majority of two\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nThe scene in the House had all the air of tragedy, and Mr. Gladstone\r\nsummoned courage enough to do his part with impressive composure. A\r\ncolleague was doing some business with him in his room before the\r\nsolemnity began. When it was over, they resumed it, Mr. Gladstone making\r\nno word of reference to the sombre interlude, before or after. “Went\r\nreluctantly to the House,” he says in his diary, “and by the help of God\r\nforced out what was needful on the question of the adjournment.” His words\r\nwere not many, when after commemorating the marked qualities of Mr. Burke,\r\nhe went on in laboured tones and slow speech and hardly repressed\r\nemotion:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The hand of the assassin has come nearer home; and though I feel\r\n    it difficult to say a word, yet I must say that one of the very\r\n    noblest hearts in England has ceased to beat, and has ceased at\r\n    the very moment when it was just devoted to the service of\r\n    Ireland, full of love for that country, full of hope for her\r\n    future, full of capacity to render her service.\r\n\r\n\r\nWriting to Lady Frederick on a later day, he mentions a public reference\r\nto some pathetic words of hers (May 19):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sexton just now returned to the subject, with much approval from\r\n    the House. You will find it near the middle of a long speech.\r\n    Nothing could be better either in feeling or in grace (the man is\r\n    little short of a master), and I think it will warm your heart.\r\n    You have made a mark deeper than any wound.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Lord Ripon in India, he wrote (June 1):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The black act brought indeed a great personal grief to my wife and\r\n    me; but we are bound to merge our own sorrow in the larger and\r\n    deeper affliction of the widow and the father, in the sense of the\r\n    public loss of a life so valuable to the nation, and in the\r\n    consideration of the great and varied effects it may have on\r\n    immediate and vital interests. Since the death of this dearly\r\n    loved son, we have heard much good of the Duke, whom indeed we saw\r\n    at Chatsworth after the funeral, and we have seen much of Lady\r\n    Frederick, who has been good even beyond what we could have hoped.\r\n    I have no doubt you have heard in India the echo of words spoken\r\n    by Spencer from a letter of hers, in which she said she could give\r\n    up even him if his death were to work good to his fellow-men,\r\n    which indeed was the whole object of his life. These words have\r\n    had a tender effect, as remarkable as the horror excited by the\r\n    slaughter. Spencer wrote to me that a priest in Connemara read\r\n    them from the altar; when the whole congregation spontaneously\r\n    fell down upon their knees. In England, the national attitude has\r\n    been admirable. The general strain of language has been, “Do not\r\n    let this terrible and flagitious crime deter you from persevering\r\n    with the work of justice.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWell did Dean Church say that no Roman or Florentine lady ever uttered a\r\nmore heroic thing than was said by this English lady when on first seeing\r\nMr. Gladstone that terrible midnight she said, “You did right to send him\r\nto Ireland.”(44) “The loss of F. Cavendish,” Mr. Gladstone wrote to his\r\neldest son, “will ever be to us all as an unhealed wound.”\r\n\r\nOn the day after the murders Mr. Gladstone received a note through the\r\nsame channel by which Mr. Chamberlain had carried on his communications:\r\n“I am authorised by Mr. Parnell to state that if Mr. Gladstone considers\r\nit necessary for the maintenance of his [Mr. G.’s] position and for\r\ncarrying out his views, that Mr. Parnell should resign his seat, Mr.\r\nParnell is prepared to do so immediately.” To this Mr. Gladstone replied\r\n(May 7):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    My duty does not permit me for a moment to entertain Mr. Parnell’s\r\n    proposal, just conveyed to me by you, that he should if I think it\r\n    needful resign his seat; but I am deeply sensible of the\r\n    honourable motives by which it has been prompted.\r\n\r\n\r\n“My opinion is,” said Mr. Gladstone to Lord Granville, “that if Parnell\r\ngoes, no restraining influence will remain; the scale of outrages will be\r\nagain enlarged; and no repressive bill can avail to put it down.” Those of\r\nthe cabinet who had the best chance of knowing, were convinced that Mr.\r\nParnell was “sincerely anxious for the pacification of Ireland.”\r\n\r\nThe reaction produced by the murders in the Park made perseverance in a\r\nmilder policy impossible in face of English opinion, and parliament\r\neagerly passed the Coercion Act of 1882. I once asked an Irishman of\r\nconsummate experience and equitable mind, with no leanings that I know of\r\nto political nationalism, whether the task of any later ruler of Ireland\r\nwas comparable to Lord Spencer’s. “Assuredly not,” he replied: “in 1882\r\nIreland seemed to be literally a society on the eve of dissolution. The\r\nInvincibles still roved with knives about the streets of Dublin.\r\nDiscontent had been stirred in the ranks of the Royal Irish Constabulary,\r\nand a dangerous mutiny broke out in the metropolitan force. Over half of\r\nthe country the demoralisation of every class, the terror, the fierce\r\nhatred, the universal distrust, had grown to an incredible pitch. The\r\nmoral cowardice of what ought to have been the governing class was\r\nastounding. The landlords would hold meetings and agree not to go beyond a\r\ncertain abatement, and then they would go individually and privately offer\r\nto the tenant a greater abatement. Even the agents of the law and the\r\ncourts were shaken in their duty. The power of random arrest and detention\r\nunder the Coercion Act of 1881 had not improved the _moral_ of magistrates\r\nand police. The sheriff would let the word get out that he was coming to\r\nmake a seizure, and profess surprise that the cattle had vanished. The\r\nwhole country-side turned out in thousands in half the counties in Ireland\r\nto attend flaming meetings, and if a man did not attend, angry neighbours\r\ntrooped up to know the reason why. The clergy hardly stirred a finger to\r\nrestrain the wildness of the storm; some did their best to raise it. All\r\nthat was what Lord Spencer had to deal with; the very foundations of the\r\nsocial fabric rocking.”\r\n\r\nThe new viceroy attacked the formidable task before him with resolution,\r\nminute assiduity, and an inexhaustible store of that steady-eyed patience\r\nwhich is the sovereign requisite of any man who, whether with coercion or\r\nwithout, takes in hand the government of Ireland. He was seconded with\r\nhigh ability and courage by Mr. Trevelyan, the new Irish secretary, whose\r\nfortitude was subjected to a far severer trial than has ever fallen to the\r\nlot of any Irish secretary before or since. The coercion that Lord Spencer\r\nhad to administer was at least law. The coercion with which parliament\r\nentrusted Mr. Forster the year before was the negation of the spirit of\r\nlaw, and the substitution for it of naked and arbitrary control over the\r\nliberty of the subject by executive power—a system as unconstitutional in\r\ntheory as it was infatuated in policy and calamitous in result. Even\r\nbefore the end of the parliament, Mr. Bright frankly told the House of\r\nCommons of this Coercion Act: “I think that the legislation of 1881 was\r\nunfortunately a great mistake, though I was myself a member of the\r\ngovernment concerned in it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V. Egypt. (1881-1882)\r\n\r\n\r\n    I find many very ready to say what I ought to have done when a\r\n    battle is over; but I wish some of these persons would come and\r\n    tell me what to do before the battle.—WELLINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1877 Mr. Gladstone penned words to which later events gave an only too\r\nstriking verification. “Territorial questions,” he said, “are not to be\r\ndisposed of by arbitrary limits; we cannot enjoy the luxury of taking\r\nEgyptian soil by pinches. We may seize an Aden and a Perim, where is no\r\nalready formed community of inhabitants, and circumscribe a tract at will.\r\nBut our first site in Egypt, be it by larceny or be it by emption, will be\r\nthe almost certain egg of a North African empire, that will grow and grow\r\nuntil another Victoria and another Albert, titles of the lake-sources of\r\nthe White Nile, come within our borders; and till we finally join hands\r\nacross the equator with Natal and Cape Town, to say nothing of the\r\nTransvaal and the Orange River on the south, or of Abyssinia or Zanzibar\r\nto be swallowed by way of viaticum on our journey.”(45) It was one of the\r\nironies in which every active statesman’s life abounds, that the author of\r\nthat forecast should have been fated to take his country over its first\r\nmarches towards this uncoveted destination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many months after Mr. Gladstone formed his second ministry, there was\r\nno reason to suppose that the Egyptian branch of the eastern question,\r\nwhich for ever casts its (M28) perplexing shadow over Europe, was likely\r\nto give trouble. The new Khedive held a regularly defined position, alike\r\ntowards his titular sovereign at Constantinople, towards reforming\r\nministers at Cairo, towards the creditors of his state, and towards the\r\ntwo strong European Powers who for different reasons had the supervision\r\nof Egyptian affairs in charge. The oppression common to oriental\r\ngovernments seemed to be yielding before western standards. The load of\r\ninterest on a profligate debt was heavy, but it was not unskilfully\r\nadjusted. The rate of village usury was falling, and the value of land was\r\nrising. Unluckily the Khedive and his ministers neglected the grievances\r\nof the army, and in January 1881 its leaders broke out in revolt. The\r\nKhedive, without an armed force on whose fidelity he could rely, gave way\r\nto the mutineers, and a situation was created, familiar enough in all\r\noriental states, and not unlike that in our own country between Charles\r\nI., or in later days the parliament, and the roundhead troopers: anger and\r\nrevenge in the breast of the affronted civil ruler, distrust and dread of\r\npunishment in the mind of the soldiery. During the autumn (1881) the\r\ncrisis grew more alarming. The Khedive showed neither energy nor tact; he\r\nneither calmed the terror of the mutineers nor crushed them.\r\nInsubordination in the army began to affect the civil population, and a\r\nnational party came into open existence in the chamber of notables. The\r\nsoldiers found a head in Arabi, a native Egyptian, sprung of fellah\r\norigin. Want either of stern resolution or of politic vision in the\r\nKhedive and his minister had transferred the reality of power to the\r\ninsurgents. The Sultan of Turkey here saw his chance; he made a series of\r\ndiplomatic endeavours to reestablish a shattered sovereignty over his\r\nnominal feudatory on the Nile. This pretension, and the spreading tide of\r\ndisorder, brought England and France actively upon the scene. We can see\r\nnow, what expert observers on the spot saw then, that the two Powers\r\nmistook the nature of the Arabist movement. They perceived in it no more\r\nthan a military rising. It was in truth national as well as military; it\r\nwas anti-European, and above all, it was in its objects anti-Turk.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 the two governments had insisted on imposing over Egypt two\r\ncontrollers, with limited functions but irremovable. This, as Mr.\r\nGladstone argued later, was to bring foreign intervention into the heart\r\nof the country, and to establish in the strictest sense a political\r\ncontrol.(46) As a matter of fact, not then well known, in September 1879\r\nLord Salisbury had come to a definite understanding with the French\r\nambassador in London, that the two governments would not tolerate the\r\nestablishment in Egypt of political influence by any competing European\r\nPower; and what was more important, that they were prepared to take action\r\nto any extent that might be found necessary to give effect to their views\r\nin this respect. The notable acquisition by Lord Beaconsfield of an\r\ninterest in the Suez Canal, always regarded by Mr. Gladstone as a\r\npolitically ill-advised and hazardous transaction, had tied the English\r\nknot in Egypt still tighter.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Gladstone cabinet was defined in general words in a\r\ndespatch from the foreign minister to the British agent at Cairo. Lord\r\nGranville (November 1881) disclaimed any self-aggrandising designs on the\r\npart of either England or France. He proclaimed the desire of the cabinet\r\nto uphold in Egypt the administrative independence secured to her by the\r\ndecrees of the sovereign power on the Bosphorus. Finally he set forth that\r\nthe only circumstances likely to force the government of the Queen to\r\ndepart from this course of conduct, would be the occurrence in Egypt of a\r\nstate of anarchy.(47)\r\n\r\nJustly averse to a joint occupation of Egypt by England and France, as the\r\nmost perilous of all possible courses, the London cabinet looked to the\r\nSultan as the best instrument for restoring order. Here they were\r\nconfronted by two insurmountable obstacles: first, the steadfast hostility\r\nof France to any form of Turkish intervention, and second, that strong\r\ncurrent of antipathy to the Sultan which had been set flowing over British\r\nopinion in the days of Midlothian.(48)\r\n\r\n(M29) In December (1881) the puissant genius of Gambetta acquired\r\nsupremacy for a season, and he without delay pressed upon the British\r\ncabinet the necessity of preparing for joint and immediate action.\r\nGambetta prevailed. The Turk was ruled out, and the two Powers of the west\r\ndetermined on action of their own. The particular mode of common action,\r\nhowever, in case action should become necessary, was left entirely open.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the British cabinet was induced to agree to Gambetta’s proposal\r\nto send instructions to Cairo, assuring the Khedive that England and\r\nFrance were closely associated in the resolve to guard by their united\r\nefforts against all causes of complaint, internal or external, which might\r\nmenace the existing order of things in Egypt. This was a memorable\r\nstarting-point in what proved an amazing journey. This Joint Note (January\r\n6, 1881) was the first link in a chain of proceedings that brought each of\r\nthe two governments who were its authors, into the very position that they\r\nwere most strenuously bent on averting; France eventually ousted herself\r\nfrom Egypt, and England was eventually landed in plenary and permanent\r\noccupation. So extraordinary a result only shows how impenetrable were the\r\nwindings of the labyrinth. The foremost statesmen of England and France\r\nwere in their conning towers, and England at any rate employed some of the\r\nablest of her agents. Yet each was driven out of an appointed course to an\r\nunforeseen and an unwelcome termination. Circumstances like these might\r\nteach moderation both to the French partisans who curse the vacillations\r\nof M. de Freycinet, and to the English partisans who, while rejoicing in\r\nthe ultimate result, curse the vacillations of the cabinet of Mr.\r\nGladstone, in wisely striving to unravel a knot instead of at all risks\r\ncutting it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present writer described the effect of the Joint Note in the following\r\nwords written at the time(49): “At Cairo the Note fell like a bombshell.\r\nNobody there had expected any such declaration, and nobody was aware of\r\nany reason why it should have been launched. What was felt was that so\r\nserious a step on such delicate ground could not have been adopted without\r\ndeliberate calculation, nor without some grave intention. The Note was,\r\ntherefore, taken to mean that the Sultan was to be thrust still further in\r\nthe background; that the Khedive was to become more plainly the puppet of\r\nEngland and France; and that Egypt would sooner or later in some shape or\r\nother be made to share the fate of Tunis. The general effect was,\r\ntherefore, mischievous in the highest degree. The Khedive was encouraged\r\nin his opposition to the sentiments of his Chamber. The military,\r\nnational, or popular party was alarmed. The Sultan was irritated. The\r\nother European Powers were made uneasy. Every element of disturbance was\r\nroused into activity.”\r\n\r\nIt is true that even if no Joint Note had ever been despatched, the\r\nprospects of order were unpromising. The most careful analysis of the\r\nvarious elements of society in Egypt by those best acquainted at first\r\nhand with all those elements, whether internal or external, whether\r\nEgyptian or European, and with all the roots of antagonism thriving among\r\nthem, exhibited no promise of stability. If Egypt had been a simple case\r\nof an oriental government in revolutionary commotion, the ferment might\r\nhave been left to work itself out. Unfortunately Egypt, in spite of the\r\nmaps, lies in Europe. So far from being a simple case, it was\r\nindescribably entangled, and even the desperate questions that rise in our\r\nminds at the mention of the Balkan peninsula, of Armenia, of\r\nConstantinople, offer no such complex of difficulties as the Egyptian\r\nriddle in 1881-2. The law of liquidation(50)—whatever else we may think of\r\nit—at least made the policy of Egypt for the Egyptians unworkable. Yet the\r\nBritish cabinet were not wrong in thinking that this was no reason for\r\nsliding into the competing policy of Egypt for the English _and_ the\r\nFrench, which would have been more unworkable still.\r\n\r\nEngland strove manfully to hold the ground that she (M30) had taken in\r\nNovember. Lord Granville told the British ambassador in Paris that his\r\ngovernment disliked intervention either by themselves or anybody else as\r\nmuch as ever; that they looked upon the experiment of the Chamber with\r\nfavourable eyes; that they wished to keep the connection of the Porte with\r\nEgypt so far as it was compatible with Egyptian liberties; and that the\r\nobject of the Joint Note was to strengthen the existing government of\r\nEgypt. Gambetta, on the other hand, was convinced that all explanations of\r\nthis sort would only serve further to inflate the enemies of France and\r\nEngland in the Egyptian community, and would encourage their designs upon\r\nthe law of liquidation. Lord Granville was honourably and consistently\r\nanxious to confine himself within the letter of international right, while\r\nGambetta was equally anxious to intervene in Egyptian administration,\r\nwithin right or without it, and to force forward that Anglo-French\r\noccupation in which Lord Granville so justly saw nothing but danger and\r\nmischief. Once more Lord Granville, at the end of the month which had\r\nopened with the Joint Note, in a despatch to the ambassador at Paris\r\n(January 30), defined the position of the British cabinet. What measures\r\nshould be taken to meet Egyptian disorders? The Queen’s government had “a\r\nstrong objection to the occupation of Egypt by themselves.” Egypt and\r\nTurkey would oppose; it would arouse the jealousy of other Powers, who\r\nwould, as there was even already good reason to believe, make counter\r\ndemonstrations; and, finally, such an occupation would be as distasteful\r\nto the French nation as the sole occupation of Egypt by the French would\r\nbe to ourselves. Joint occupation by England and France, in short, might\r\nlessen some difficulties, but it would seriously aggravate others. Turkish\r\noccupation would be a great evil, but it would not entail political\r\ndangers as great as those attending the other two courses. As for the\r\nFrench objections to the farther admission of the other European Powers to\r\nintervene in Egyptian affairs, the cabinet agreed that England and France\r\nhad an exceptional position in Egypt, but might it not be desirable to\r\nenter into some communication with the other Powers, as to the best way of\r\ndealing with a state of things that appeared likely to interfere both with\r\nthe Sultan’s firmans and with Egypt’s international engagements?\r\n\r\nAt this critical moment Gambetta fell from power. The mark that he had set\r\nupon western policy in Egypt remained. Good observers on the spot, trained\r\nin the great school of India, thought that even if there were no more than\r\na chance of working with the national party, the chance was well worth\r\ntrying. As the case was put at the time, “It is impossible to conceive a\r\nsituation that more imperatively called for caution, circumspection, and\r\ndeference to the knowledge of observers on the scene, or one that was\r\nactually handled with greater rashness and hurry. Gambetta had made up his\r\nmind that the military movement was leading to the abyss, and that it must\r\nbe peremptorily arrested. It may be that he was right in supposing that\r\nthe army, which had first found its power in the time of Ismail, would go\r\nfrom bad to worse. But everything turned upon the possibility of pulling\r\nup the army, without arousing other elements more dangerous still. M.\r\nGambetta’s impatient policy was worked out in his own head without\r\nreference to the conditions on the scene, and the result was what might\r\nhave been expected.”(51)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dual control, the system of carrying on the Egyptian government under\r\nthe advice of an English and a French agent, came to an end. The rude\r\nadministration in the provinces fell to pieces. The Khedive was helplessly\r\ninvolved in struggle after struggle with the military insurgents. The army\r\nbecame as undisputed masters of the government, as the Cromwellian army at\r\nsome moments in our civil war. Meanwhile the British government, true to\r\nMr. Gladstone’s constant principle, endeavoured to turn the question from\r\nbeing purely Anglo-French, into an international question. The Powers were\r\nnot unfavourable, but nothing came of it. Both from Paris and from London\r\nsomewhat bewildered suggestions proceeded by way of evading the central\r\nenigma, whether the intervention should be Turkish (M31) or Anglo-French.\r\nIt was decided at any rate to send powerful Anglo-French fleets to\r\nAlexandria, and Mr. Gladstone only regretted that the other Powers\r\n(including Turkey) had not been invited to have their flags represented.\r\nTo this the French objected, with the evil result that the other Powers\r\nwere displeased, and the good effect that the appearance of the Sultan in\r\nthe field might have had upon the revolutionary parties in Egypt was lost.\r\nOn May 21, 1882, M. de Freycinet went so far as to say that, though he was\r\nstill opposed to Turkish intervention, he would not regard as intervention\r\na case in which Turkish forces were summoned by England and France to\r\noperate under Anglo-French control, upon conditions specified by the two\r\nPowers. If it became advisable to land troops, recourse should be had on\r\nthese terms to Turkish troops and them only. Lord Granville acceded. He\r\nproposed (May 24) to address the Powers, to procure international sanction\r\nfor the possible despatch of Turkish troops to Egypt. M. Freycinet\r\ninsisted that no such step was necessary. At the same time (June 1), M. de\r\nFreycinet told the Chamber that there were various courses to which they\r\nmight be led, but he excluded one, and this was a French military\r\nintervention. That declaration narrowed the case to a choice between\r\nEnglish intervention, or Turkish, or Anglo-Turkish, all of them known to\r\nbe profoundly unpalatable to French sentiment. Such was the end of Lord\r\nGranville’s prudent and loyal endeavour to move in step with France.\r\n\r\nThe next proposal from M. de Freycinet was a European conference, as\r\nPrince Bismarck presumed, to cover the admissibility of Turkish\r\nintervention. A conference was too much in accord with the ideas of the\r\nBritish cabinet, not to be welcomed by them. The Turk, however, who now\r\nmight have had the game in his own hands, after a curious exhibition of\r\nduplicity and folly, declined to join, and the conference at first met\r\nwithout him (June 23). Then, pursuing tactics well known at all times at\r\nConstantinople, the Sultan made one of his attempts to divide the Powers,\r\nby sending a telegram to London (June 25), conferring upon England rights\r\nof exclusive control in the administration of Egypt.\r\n\r\nThis Mr. Gladstone and Lord Granville declined without even consulting the\r\ncabinet, as too violent an infraction, I suppose, of the cardinal\r\nprinciple of European concert. The Queen, anxious for an undivided English\r\ncontrol at any price, complained that the question was settled without\r\nreference to the cabinet, and here the Queen was clearly not wrong, on\r\ndoctrines of cabinet authority and cabinet responsibility that were\r\nusually held by nobody more strongly than by the prime minister himself.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone and his cabinet fought as hard as they could, and for good\r\nreasons, against single-handed intervention by Great Britain. When they\r\nsaw that order could not be re-established without the exercise of force\r\nfrom without, they insisted that this force should be applied by the\r\nSultan as sovereign of Egypt. They proposed this solution to the\r\nconference, and Lord Dufferin urged it upon the Sultan. With curious\r\ninfatuation (repeated a few years later) the Sultan stood aside. When it\r\nbecame necessary to make immediate provision for the safety of the Suez\r\nCanal, England proposed to undertake this duty conjointly with France, and\r\nsolicited the co-operation of any other Power. Italy was specially invited\r\nto join. Then when the progress of the rebellion had broken the Khedive’s\r\nauthority and brought Egypt to anarchy, England invited France and Italy\r\nto act with her in putting the rebellion down. France and Italy declined.\r\nEngland still urged the Porte to send troops, insisting only on such\r\nconditions as were indispensable to secure united action. The Porte again\r\nheld back, and before it carried out an agreement to sign a military\r\nconvention, events had moved too fast.(52) Thus, by the Sultan’s\r\nperversities and the fluctuations of purpose and temper in France,\r\nsingle-handed intervention was inexorably forced upon the one Power that\r\nhad most consistently striven to avoid it. Bismarck, it is true, judged\r\nthat Arabi was now a power to be reckoned with; the Austrian\r\nrepresentatives used language of like purport; and Freycinet also inclined\r\nto coming to terms with Arabi. The British cabinet had persuaded\r\nthemselves that the overthrow of the military (M32) party was an\r\nindispensable precedent to any return of decently stable order.\r\n\r\nThe situation in Egypt can hardly be adequately understood without a\r\nmultiplicity of details for which this is no place, and in such cases\r\ndetails are everything. Diplomacy in which the Sultan of Turkey plays a\r\npart is always complicated, and at the Conference of Constantinople the\r\ncobwebs were spun and brushed away and spun again with diligence\r\nunexampled. The proceedings were without any effect upon the course of\r\nevents. The Egyptian revolution ran its course. The moral support of\r\nTurkish commissioners sent by the Sultan to Cairo came to nothing, and the\r\nmoral influence of the Anglo-French squadron at Alexandria came to\r\nnothing, and in truth it did more harm than good. The Khedive’s throne and\r\nlife were alike in danger. The Christians flocked down from the interior.\r\nThe residents in Alexandria were trembling for their lives. At the end of\r\nMay our agent at Cairo informed his government that a collision between\r\nMoslems and Christians might occur at any moment. On June 11 some fifty\r\nEuropeans were massacred by a riotous mob at Alexandria. The British\r\nconsul was severely wounded, and some sailors of the French fleet were\r\namong the killed. Greeks and Jews were murdered in other places. At last a\r\ndecisive blow was struck. For several weeks the Egyptians had been at work\r\nupon the fortifications of Alexandria, and upon batteries commanding the\r\nBritish fleet. The British admiral was instructed (July 3) that if this\r\noperation were continued, he should immediately destroy the earthworks and\r\nsilence the batteries. After due formalities he (July 11) opened fire at\r\nseven in the morning, and by half-past five in the evening the Alexandria\r\nguns were silenced. Incendiaries set the town on fire, the mob pillaged\r\nit, and some murders were committed. The French ships had sailed away,\r\ntheir government having previously informed the British ambassador in\r\nParis that the proposed operation would be an act of war against Egypt,\r\nand such an act of war without the express consent of the Chamber would\r\nviolate the constitution.\r\n\r\nThe new situation in which England, now found herself was quickly\r\ndescribed by the prime minister to the House of Commons. On July 22, he\r\nsaid: “We should not fully discharge our duty, if we did not endeavour to\r\nconvert the present interior state of Egypt from anarchy and conflict to\r\npeace and order. We shall look during the time that remains to us to the\r\nco-operation of the Powers of civilised Europe, if it be in any case open\r\nto us. But if every chance of obtaining co-operation is exhausted, the\r\nwork will be undertaken by the single power of England.” As for the\r\nposition of the Powers it may be described in this way. Germany and\r\nAustria were cordial and respectful; France anxious to retain a completely\r\nfriendly understanding, but wanting some equivalent for the inevitable\r\ndecline of her power in Egypt; Italy jealous of our renewing close\r\nrelations with France; Russia still sore, and on the lookout for some\r\nplausible excuse for getting the Berlin arrangement of 1878 revised in her\r\nfavour, without getting into difficulties with Berlin itself.\r\n\r\nFrance was not unwilling to take joint action with England for the defence\r\nof the canal, but would not join England in intervention beyond that\r\nobject. At the same time Freycinet wished it to be understood that France\r\nhad no objection to our advance, if we decided to make an advance. This\r\nwas more than once repeated. Gambetta in vehement wrath declared his dread\r\nlest the refusal to co-operate with England should shake an alliance of\r\npriceless value; and lest besides that immense catastrophe, it should hand\r\nover to the possession of England for ever, territories, rivers, and ports\r\nwhere the French right to live and trade was as good as hers. The mighty\r\norator declaimed in vain. Suspicion of the craft of Bismarck was in France\r\nmore lively than suspicion of aggressive designs in the cabinet of Mr.\r\nGladstone, and the Chamber was reminded how extremely well it would suit\r\nGermany that France should lock up her military force in Tunis yesterday,\r\nin Egypt to-day. Ingenious speakers, pointing to Europe covered with camps\r\nof armed men; pointing to the artful statesmanship that had pushed Austria\r\ninto Bosnia and (M33) Herzegovina, and encouraged France herself to occupy\r\nTunis; pointing to the expectant nations reserving their liberty for\r\nfuture occasions—all urgently exhorted France now to reserve her own\r\nliberty of action too. Under the influence of such ideas as these, and by\r\nthe working of rival personalities and parties, the Chamber by an immense\r\nmajority turned the Freycinet government out of office (July 29) rather\r\nthan sanction even such a degree of intervention as concerned the\r\nprotection of the Suez Canal.\r\n\r\nNine days after the bombardment of Alexandria, the British cabinet decided\r\non the despatch of what was mildly called an expeditionary force to the\r\nMediterranean, under the command of Sir Garnet Wolseley. The general’s\r\nalertness, energy, and prescient calculation brought him up to Arabi at\r\nTel-el-Kebir (Sept. 13), and there at one rapid and decisive blow he\r\ncrushed the military insurrection.(53)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bombardment of Alexandria cost Mr. Gladstone the British colleague who\r\nin fundamentals stood closest to him of them all. In the opening days of\r\nJuly, amid differences of opinion that revealed themselves in frequent and\r\nprotracted meetings of the cabinet, it was thought probable that Mr.\r\nGladstone and Bright would resign rather than be parties to despatching\r\ntroops to the Mediterranean; and the two representative radicals were\r\nexpected to join them. Then came the bombardment, but only Bright went—not\r\nuntil after earnest protestations from the prime minister. As Mr.\r\nGladstone described things later to the Queen, Bright’s letters and\r\nconversation consisted very much more of references to his past career and\r\nstrong statements of feeling, than of attempts to reason on the existing\r\nfacts of the case, with the obligations that they appeared to entail. Not\r\nsatisfied with his own efforts, Mr. Gladstone turned to Lord Granville,\r\nwho had been a stout friend in old days when Bright’s was a name of\r\nreproach and obloquy:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _July 12._—Here is the apprehended letter from dear old John\r\n    Bright, which turns a white day into a black one. It would not be\r\n    fair in me to beg an interview. His kindness would make him\r\n    reluctant to decline; but he would come laden with an\r\n    apprehension, that I by impetuosity and tenacity should endeavour\r\n    to overbear him. But pray consider whether you could do it. He\r\n    would not have the same fear of your dealings with him. I do not\r\n    think you could get a _reversal_, but perhaps he would give you\r\n    another short delay, and at the end of this the sky might be\r\n    further settled.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days later Mr. Gladstone and Bright had a long, and we may be sure\r\nthat it was an earnest, conversation. The former of them the same day put\r\nhis remarks into the shape of a letter, which the reader may care to have,\r\nas a statement of the case for the first act of armed intervention, which\r\nled up by a direct line to the English occupation of Egypt, Soudan wars,\r\nand to some other events from which the veil is not even yet lifted:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The act of Tuesday [the bombardment of Alexandria] was a solemn\r\n    and painful one, for which I feel myself to be highly responsible,\r\n    and it is my earnest desire that we should all view it now, as we\r\n    shall wish at the last that we had viewed it. Subject to this\r\n    testing rule, I address you as one whom I suppose not to believe\r\n    all use whatever of military force to be unlawful; as one who\r\n    detests war in general and believes most wars to have been sad\r\n    errors (in which I greatly agree with you), but who in regard to\r\n    any particular use of force would look upon it for a justifying\r\n    cause, and after it would endeavour to appreciate its actual\r\n    effect.\r\n\r\n    The general situation in Egypt had latterly become one in which\r\n    everything was governed by sheer military violence. Every\r\n    legitimate authority—the Khedive, the Sultan, the notables, and\r\n    the best men of the country, such as Cherif and Sultan pashas—had\r\n    been put down, and a situation, of _force_ had been created, which\r\n    could only be met by force. This being so, we had laboured to the\r\n    uttermost, almost alone but not without success, to secure that if\r\n    force were employed against the violence of Arabi, it should be\r\n    force armed with the highest sanction of law; that it should be\r\n    the force of the sovereign, authorised and restrained by the\r\n    united Powers of Europe, who in such a case represent the\r\n    civilised world.\r\n\r\n    While this is going on, a by-question arises. The British fleet,\r\n    lawfully present in the waters of Alexandria, had the right and\r\n    duty of self-defence. It demanded the discontinuance of attempts\r\n    made to strengthen the armament of the fortifications.... Met by\r\n    fraud and falsehood in its demand, it required surrender with a\r\n    view to immediate dismantling, and this being refused, it\r\n    proceeded to destroy.... The conflagration which followed, the\r\n    pillage and any other outrages effected by the released convicts,\r\n    these are not due to us, but to the seemingly wanton wickedness of\r\n    Arabi....\r\n\r\n    Such being the amount of our act, what has been its reception and\r\n    its effect? As to its reception, we have not received nor heard of\r\n    a word of disapproval from any Power great or small, or from any\r\n    source having the slightest authority. As to its effect, it has\r\n    taught many lessons, struck a heavy, perhaps a deadly, blow at the\r\n    reign of violence, brought again into light the beginnings of\r\n    legitimate rule, shown the fanaticism of the East that massacre of\r\n    Europeans is not likely to be perpetrated with impunity, and\r\n    greatly advanced the Egyptian question towards a permanent and\r\n    peaceable solution. I feel that in being party to this work I have\r\n    been a labourer in the cause of peace. Your co-operation in that\r\n    cause, with reference to preceding and collateral points, has been\r\n    of the utmost value, and has enabled me to hold my ground, when\r\n    without you it might have been difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe correspondence closed with a wish from Mr. Gladstone: “Believe in the\r\nsore sense of practical loss, and the (I trust) unalterable friendship and\r\nregard with which I remain, etc.” When Bright came to explain his\r\nresignation in parliament, he said something about the moral law, which\r\nled to a sharp retort from the prime minister, but still their friendship\r\ndid appear to remain unalterable, as Mr. Gladstone trusted that it would.\r\n\r\nWhen the question by and by arose whether Arabi should be put to death,\r\nBright wrote to the prime minister on behalf of clemency. Mr. Gladstone in\r\nreplying took a severe line: “I am sorry to say the inquiry is too likely\r\nto show that Arabi is very much more than a rebel. Crimes of the gravest\r\nkind have been committed; and with most of them he stands, I fear, in\r\n_presumptive_ (that is, unproved) connection. In truth I must say that,\r\nhaving begun with no prejudice against him, and with the strong desire\r\nthat he should be saved, I am almost driven to the conclusion that he is a\r\nbad man, and that it will not be an injustice if he goes the road which\r\nthousands of his innocent countrymen through him have trodden.” It is a\r\ngreat mistake to suppose that Mr. Gladstone was all leniency, or that when\r\nhe thought ill of men, he stayed either at palliating words or at\r\nhalf-measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI. Political Jubilee. (1882-1883)\r\n\r\n\r\n    ἀγωνίζεται γὰρ ὥσπερ ἀθλητὴς κατὰ τὸν βίον, ὅταν δὲ διαγωνίσηται,\r\n    τότε τυγχάνει τῶν προσηκόντων.—PLUTARCH, _Moralia_, c. 18.\r\n\r\n    He strives like an athlete all his life long, and then when he\r\n    comes to the end of his striving, he has what is meet.\r\n\r\n    ἐπάμεροι: τί δέ τις; τί δ᾽ οὔ τις; σκιᾶς ὄναρ\r\n    ἄνθρωπος. ἀλλ᾽ ὅταν αἴγλα διόσδοτος ἔλθῃ,\r\n    λαμπρὸν φέγγος ἔπεστιν ἀνδρῶν καὶ μείλικος αἰών.\r\n    —PINDAR, _Pyth._ viii. 135.\r\n\r\n    Things of a day! What is a man? What, when he is not? A dream of\r\n    shadow is mankind. Yet when there comes down glory imparted from\r\n    God, radiant light shines among men and genial days.\r\n\r\n    θανεῖν δ᾽ οἷσιν ἀνάγκα, τί κέ τις ἀνώνυμον γῆρας ὲν σκότῳ\r\n    καθήμενος ἔψοι μάταν;—_Ol._ i. 131.\r\n\r\n    Die since we must, wherefore should a man sit idle and nurse in\r\n    the gloom days of long life without aim, without name?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe words from “antique books” that I have just translated and\r\ntranscribed, were written out by Mr. Gladstone inside the cover of the\r\nlittle diary for 1882-3. To what the old world had to say, he added\r\nDante’s majestic commonplace: “You were not to live like brutes, but to\r\npursue virtue and knowledge.”(54) These meditations on the human lot, on\r\nthe mingling of our great hopes with the implacable realities, made the\r\nvital air in which all through his life he drew deep breath. Adjusted to\r\nhis ever vivid religious creed, amid all the turbid business of the\r\nworldly elements, they were the sedative and the restorer. Yet here and\r\nalways the last word was Effort. The moods that in less strenuous natures\r\nended in melancholy, philosophic or poetic, to him were fresh incentives\r\nto redeem the time.\r\n\r\nThe middle of December 1882 marked his political jubilee. It was now half\r\na century since he had entered public life, and the youthful graduate from\r\nOxford had grown to be the foremost man in his country. Yet these fifty\r\ncourses of the sun and all the pageant of the world had in some ways made\r\nbut little difference in him. In some ways, it seemed as if time had\r\nrolled over him in vain. He had learned many lessons. He had changed his\r\nparty, his horizons were far wider, new social truths had made their way\r\ninto his impressionable mind, he recognised new social forces. His aims\r\nfor the church, that he loved as ardently as he gloried in a powerful and\r\nbeneficent state, had undergone a revolution. Since 1866 he had come into\r\ncontact with democracy at close quarters; the Bulgarian campaign and\r\nMidlothian lighting up his early faith in liberty, had inflamed him with\r\nnew feeling for the voice of the people. As much as in the early time when\r\nhe had prayed to be allowed to go into orders, he was moved by a\r\ndominating sense of the common claims and interests of mankind. ’The\r\ncontagion of the world’s slow stain’ had not infected him; the lustre and\r\nlong continuity of his public performances still left all his innermost\r\nideals constant and undimmed.\r\n\r\nHis fifty years of public life had wrought his early habits of severe\r\ntoil, method, exactness, concentration, into cast-iron. Whether they had\r\nsharpened what is called knowledge of the world, or taught him insight\r\ninto men and skill in discrimination among men, it is hard to say. He\r\nalways talked as if he found the world pretty much what he had expected.\r\nMan, he used often to say, is the least comprehensible of creatures, and\r\nof men the most incomprehensible are the politicians. Yet nobody was less\r\nof the cynic. As for Weltschmerz, world-weariness, ennui, tedium (M34)\r\nvitæ—that enervating family were no acquaintances of his, now nor at any\r\ntime. None of the vicissitudes of long experience ever tempted him either\r\ninto the shallow satire on life that is so often the solace of the little\r\nand the weak; or on the other hand into the _saeva indignatio_, the sombre\r\nbrooding reprobation, that has haunted some strong souls from Tacitus and\r\nDante to Pascal, Butler, Swift, Turgot. We may, indeed, be sure that\r\nneither of these two moods can ever hold a place in the breast of a\r\ncommanding orator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nI have spoken of his new feeling for democracy. At the point of time at\r\nwhich we have arrived, it was heartily reciprocated. The many difficulties\r\nin the course of public affairs that confronted parliament and the nation\r\nfor two years or more after Mr. Gladstone’s second accession to power, did\r\nlittle to weaken either his personal popularity or his hold upon the\r\nconfidence of the constituencies. For many years he and Mr. Disraeli had\r\nstood out above the level of their adherents; they were the centre of\r\nevery political storm. Disraeli was gone (April 19, 1881), commemorated by\r\nMr. Gladstone in a parliamentary tribute that cost him much searching of\r\nheart beforehand, and was a masterpiece of grace and good feeling. Mr.\r\nGladstone stood alone, concentrating upon himself by his personal\r\nascendency and public history the bitter antagonism of his opponents, only\r\nmatched by the enthusiasm and devotion of his followers. The rage of\r\nfaction had seldom been more unbridled. The Irish and the young fourth\r\nparty were rivals in malicious vituperation; of the two, the Irish on the\r\nwhole observed the better manners. Once Mr. Gladstone was wounded to the\r\nquick, as letters show, when a member of the fourth party denounced as “a\r\ngovernment of infamy” the ministry with whose head he had long been on\r\nterms of more than friendship alike as host and guest. He could not fell\r\nhis trees, he could not read the lessons in Hawarden church, without\r\nfinding these innocent habits turned into material for platform mockery.\r\n“In the eyes of the opposition, as indeed of the country,” said a great\r\nprint that was never much his friend, “he is the government and he is the\r\nliberal party,” and the writer went on to scold Lord Salisbury for wasting\r\nhis time in the concoction of angry epigrams and pungent phrases that were\r\nneither new nor instructive.(55) They pierced no joint in the mail of the\r\nwarrior at whom they were levelled. The nation at large knew nothing of\r\ndifficulties at Windsor, nothing of awkward passages in the cabinet,\r\nnothing of the trying egotisms of gentlemen out of the cabinet who\r\ninsisted that they ought to be in. Nor would such things have made any\r\ndifference except in his favour, if the public had known all about them.\r\nThe Duke of Argyll and Lord Lansdowne had left him; his Irish policy had\r\ncost him his Irish secretary, and his Egyptian policy had cost him Mr.\r\nBright. They had got into a war, they had been baffled in legislation,\r\nthey had to raise the most unpopular of taxes, there had been the\r\nfrightful tragedy in Ireland. Yet all seemed to have been completely\r\novercome in the public mind by the power of Mr. Gladstone in uniting his\r\nfriends and frustrating his foes, and the more bitterly he was hated by\r\nsociety, the more warmly attached were the mass of the people. Anybody who\r\nhad foreseen all this would have concluded that the government must be in\r\nextremity, but he went to the Guildhall on the 9th of November 1882, and\r\nhad the best possible reception on that famous stage. One tory newspaper\r\nfelt bound to admit that Mr. Gladstone and his colleagues had\r\nrehabilitated themselves in the public judgment with astounding rapidity,\r\nand were now almost as strong in popular and parliamentary support as when\r\nthey first took office.(56) Another tory print declared Mr. Gladstone to\r\nbe stronger, more popular, more despotic, than at any time since the\r\npolicy to carry out which he was placed in office was disclosed.(57) The\r\nsession of 1882 had only been exceeded in duration by two sessions for\r\nfifty years.\r\n\r\nThe reader has had pictures enough from friendly hands, so here is one\r\nfrom a persistent foe, one of the most brilliant journalists of that time,\r\nwho listened to him from (M35) the gallery for years. The words are from\r\nan imaginary dialogue, and are put into the mouth of a well-known whig in\r\nparliament:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sir, I can only tell you that, profoundly as I distrusted him, and\r\n    lightly as on the whole I valued the external qualities of his\r\n    eloquence, I have never listened to him even for a few minutes\r\n    without ceasing to marvel at his influence over men. That\r\n    white-hot face, stern as a Covenanter’s yet mobile as a\r\n    comedian’s; those restless, flashing eyes; that wondrous voice,\r\n    whose richness its northern burr enriched as the tang of the wood\r\n    brings out the mellowness of a rare old wine; the masterly cadence\r\n    of his elocution; the vivid energy of his attitudes; the fine\r\n    animation of his gestures;—sir, when I am assailed through eye and\r\n    ear by this compacted phalanx of assailants, what wonder that the\r\n    stormed outposts of the senses should spread the contagion of\r\n    their own surrender through the main encampment of the mind, and\r\n    that against my judgment, in contempt of my conscience, nay, in\r\n    defiance of my very will, I should exclaim, “This is indeed the\r\n    voice of truth and wisdom. This man is honest and sagacious beyond\r\n    his fellows. He must be believed, he must be obeyed!”(58)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day of his political jubilee (Dec. 13), the event was celebrated in\r\nmany parts of the country, and he received congratulatory telegrams from\r\nall parts of the world; for it was not only two hundred and forty liberal\r\nassociations who sent him joyful addresses. The Roumelians poured out\r\naloud their gratitude to him for the interest he constantly manifested in\r\ntheir cause, and for his powerful and persistent efforts for their\r\nemancipation. From Athens came the news that they had subscribed for the\r\nerection of his statue, and from the Greeks also came a splendid casket.\r\nIn his letter of thanks,(59) after remonstrating against its too great\r\nmaterial value, he said:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I know not well how to accept it, yet I am still less able to\r\n    decline it, when I read the touching lines of the accompanying\r\n    address, in itself an ample token, in which you have so closely\r\n    associated my name with the history and destinies of your country.\r\n    I am not vain enough to think that I have deserved any of the\r\n    numerous acknowledgments which I have received, especially from\r\n    Greeks, on completing half a century of parliamentary life. Your\r\n    over-estimate of my deeds ought rather to humble than to inflate\r\n    me. But to have laboured within the measure of justice for the\r\n    Greece of the future, is one of my happiest political\r\n    recollections, and to have been trained in a partial knowledge of\r\n    the Greece of the past has largely contributed to whatever slender\r\n    faculties I possess for serving my own country or my kind. I\r\n    earnestly thank you for your indulgent judgment and for your too\r\n    costly gifts, and I have the honour to remain, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was deeper to him than statues or caskets was found in letters from\r\ncomparative newcomers into the political arena thanking him not only for\r\nhis long roll of public service, but much more for the example and\r\nencouragement that his life gave to younger men endeavouring to do\r\nsomething for the public good. To one of these he wrote (Dec. 15):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I thank you most sincerely for your kind and friendly letter. As\r\n    regards the prospective part of it, I can assure you that I should\r\n    be slow to plead the mere title to retirement which long labour is\r\n    supposed to earn. But I have always watched, and worked according\r\n    to what I felt to be the measure of my own mental force. A monitor\r\n    from within tells me that though I may still be equal to some\r\n    portions of my duties, or as little unequal as heretofore, there\r\n    are others which I cannot face. I fear therefore I must keep in\r\n    view an issue which cannot be evaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAs it happened, this volume of testimony to the affection, gratitude, and\r\nadmiration thus ready to go out to him from so many quarters coincided in\r\npoint of time with one or two extreme vexations in the conduct of his\r\ndaily business as head of the government. Some of them were aggravated by\r\nthe loss of a man whom he regarded as one of his two or three most\r\nimportant friends. In September 1882 the Dean of Windsor died, and in his\r\ndeath Mr. Gladstone (M36) suffered a heavy blow. To the end he always\r\nspoke of Dr. Wellesley’s friendship, and the value of his sagacity and\r\nhonest service, with a warmth by this time given to few.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Death of the Dean of Windsor._\r\n\r\n    _To Lord Granville, Sept. 18, 1882._—My belief is that he has been\r\n    cognizant of every crown appointment in the church for nearly a\r\n    quarter of a century, and that the whole of his influence has been\r\n    exercised with a deep insight and a large heart for the best\r\n    interests of the crown and the church. If their character during\r\n    this period has been in the main more satisfactory to the general\r\n    mind of the country than at some former periods, it has been in no\r\n    small degree owing to him.\r\n\r\n    It has been my duty to recommend I think for fully forty of the\r\n    higher appointments, including twelve which were episcopal. I\r\n    rejoice to say that every one of them has had his approval. But I\r\n    do not scruple to own that he has been in no small degree a help\r\n    and guide to me; and as to the Queen, whose heart I am sure is at\r\n    this moment bleeding, I do not believe she can possibly fill his\r\n    place as a friendly adviser either in ecclesiastical or other\r\n    matters.\r\n\r\n    _To the Duchess of Wellington, Sept. 24._—He might, if he had\r\n    chosen, have been on his way to the Archbishopric of Canterbury.\r\n    Ten or eleven years ago, when the present primate was not expected\r\n    to recover, the question of the succession was considered, and I\r\n    had her Majesty’s consent to the idea I have now mentioned. But,\r\n    governed I think by his great modesty, he at once refused.\r\n\r\n    _To Mrs. Wellesley, Nov. 19, 1882._—I have remained silent, at\r\n    least to you, on a subject which for no day has been absent from\r\n    my thoughts, because I felt that I could add nothing to your\r\n    consolations and could take away nothing from your grief under\r\n    your great calamity. But the time has perhaps come when I may\r\n    record my sense of a loss of which even a small share is so large.\r\n    The recollections of nearly sixty years are upon my mind, and\r\n    through all that period I have felt more and more the force and\r\n    value of your husband’s simple and noble character. No less have I\r\n    entertained an ever-growing sense of his great sagacity and the\r\n    singularly true and just balance of his mind. We owe much indeed\r\n    to you both for your constantly renewed kindness, but I have\r\n    another debt to acknowledge in the invaluable assistance which he\r\n    afforded me in the discharge of one among the most important and\r\n    most delicate of my duties. This void never can be filled, and it\r\n    helps me in some degree to feel what must be the void to you.\r\n    Certainly he was happy in the enjoyment of love and honour from\r\n    all who knew him; yet these were few in comparison with those whom\r\n    he so wisely and so warmly served without their knowing it; and\r\n    the love and honour paid him, great as they were, could not be as\r\n    great as he deserved. His memory is blessed—may his rest be deep\r\n    and sweet, and may the memory and example of him ever help you in\r\n    your onward pilgrimage.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same week Dr. Pusey died—a name that filled so large a space in the\r\nreligious history of England for some thirty years of the century. Between\r\nMr. Gladstone and him the old relations of affectionate friendship\r\nsubsisted unbroken, notwithstanding the emancipation, as we may call it,\r\nof the statesman from maxims and principles, though not, so far as I know,\r\nfrom any of the leading dogmatic beliefs cherished by the divine. “I\r\nhope,” he wrote to Phillimore (Sept. 20, 1882), “to attend Dr. Pusey’s\r\nfuneral to-morrow at Oxford.... I shall have another mournful office to\r\ndischarge in attending the funeral of the Dean of Windsor, more mournful\r\nthan the first. Dr. Pusey’s death is the ingathering of a ripe shock, and\r\nI go to his obsequies in token of deep respect and in memory of much\r\nkindness from him early in my life. But the death of Dean Wellesley is to\r\nmy wife and me an unexpected and very heavy blow, also to me an\r\nirreparable loss. I had honoured and loved him from Eton days.”\r\n\r\nThe loss of Dean Wellesley’s counsels was especially felt in\r\necclesiastical appointments, and the greatest of these was made necessary\r\nby the death of the Archbishop of Canterbury at the beginning of December.\r\nThat the prime minister should regard so sage, conciliatory, and\r\nlarge-minded a steersman as Dr. Tait with esteem was certain, and their\r\nrelations were easy and manly. Still, Tait had been an active liberal when\r\nMr. Gladstone was a tory, and (M37) from the distant days of the _Tracts\r\nfor the Times_, when Tait had stood amongst the foremost in open dislike\r\nof the new tenets, their paths in the region of theology lay wide apart.\r\n“I well remember,” says Dean Lake, “a conversation with Mr. Gladstone on\r\nTait’s appointment to London in 1856, when he was much annoyed at Tait’s\r\nbeing preferred to Bishop Wilberforce, and of which he reminded me nearly\r\nthirty years afterwards, at the time of the archbishop’s death, by saying,\r\n‘Ah! I remember you maintaining to me at that time that his σεμνότης and\r\nhis judgment would make him a great bishop.’ ”(60) And so, from the point\r\nof ecclesiastical statesmanship, he unquestionably was.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation of a successor in the historic see of Canterbury, we\r\nmay be very certain, was no common event to Mr. Gladstone. Tait on his\r\ndeathbed had given his opinion that Dr. Harold Browne, the Bishop of\r\nWinchester, would do more than any other man to keep the peace of the\r\nchurch. The Queen was strong in the same sense, thinking that the bishop\r\nmight resign in a year or two, if he could not do the work. He was now\r\nseventy-one years old, and Mr. Gladstone judged this to be too advanced an\r\nage for the metropolitan throne. He was himself now seventy-three, and\r\nthough his sense of humour was not always of the protective kind, he felt\r\nthe necessity of some explanatory reason, and with him to seek a plea was\r\nto find one. He wrote to the Bishop of Winchester:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    ... It may seem strange that I, who in my own person exhibit so\r\n    conspicuously the anomaly of a disparate conjunction between years\r\n    and duties, should be thus forward in interpreting the\r\n    circumstances of another case certainly more mitigated in many\r\n    respects, yet differing from my own case in one vital point, the\r\n    newness of the duties of the English, or rather anglican or\r\n    British, primacy to a diocesan bishop, however able and\r\n    experienced, and the newness of mental attitude and action, which\r\n    they would require. Among the materials of judgment in such an\r\n    instance, it seems right to reckon precedents for what they are\r\n    worth; and I cannot find that from the time of Archbishop Sheldon\r\n    any one has assumed the primacy at so great an age as seventy.\r\n    Juxon, the predecessor of Sheldon, was much older; but his case\r\n    was altogether peculiar. I cannot say how pleasant it would have\r\n    been to me personally, but for the barrier I have named, to mark\r\n    my respect and affection for your lordship by making to you such a\r\n    proposal. What is more important is, that I am directly authorised\r\n    by her Majesty to state that this has been the single impediment\r\n    to her conferring the honour, and imposing the burden, upon you of\r\n    such an offer.(61)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world made free with the honoured name of Church, the Dean of Saint\r\nPaul’s, and it has constantly been said that he declined the august\r\npreferment to Canterbury on this occasion. In that story there is no\r\ntruth. “Formal offer,” the Dean himself wrote to a friend, “there was\r\nnone, and could not be, for I had already on another occasion told my mind\r\nto Gladstone, and said that reasons of health, apart from other reasons,\r\nmade it impossible for me to think of anything, except a retirement\r\naltogether from office.”(62)\r\n\r\nWhen it was rumoured that Mr. Gladstone intended to recommend Dr. Benson,\r\nthen Bishop of Truro, to the archbishopric, a political supporter came to\r\nremonstrate with him. “The Bishop of Truro is a strong tory,” he said,\r\n“but that is not all. He has joined Mr. Raikes’s election committee at\r\nCambridge; and it was only last week that Raikes made a violent personal\r\nattack on yourself.” “Do you know,” replied Mr. Gladstone, “you have just\r\nsupplied me with a strong argument in Dr. Benson’s favour? For if he had\r\nbeen a worldly man or self-seeker, he would not have done anything so\r\nimprudent.” Perhaps we cannot wonder that whips and wirepullers deemed\r\nthis to be somewhat over-ingenious, a Christianity out of season. Even\r\nliberals who took another point of view, still asked themselves how it was\r\n(M38) that when church preferment came his way, the prime minister so\r\noften found the best clergymen in the worst politicians. They should have\r\nremembered that he was of those who believed “no more glorious church in\r\nChristendom to exist than the church of England”; and its official\r\nordering was in his eyes not any less, even if it was not infinitely more,\r\nimportant in the highest interests of the nation than the construction of\r\na cabinet or the appointment of permanent heads of departments. The church\r\nwas at this moment, moreover, in one of those angry and perilous crises\r\nthat came of the Elizabethan settlement and the Act of Uniformity, and the\r\nanglican revival forty years ago, and all the other things that mark the\r\narrested progress of the Reformation in England. The anti-ritualist hunt\r\nwas up. Civil courts were busy with the conscience and conduct of the\r\nclergy. Harmless but contumacious priests were under lock and key. It\r\nseemed as if more might follow them, or else as if the shock of the great\r\ntractarian catastrophe of the forties might in some new shape recur. To\r\nrecommend an archbishop in times like these could to a churchman be no\r\nlight responsibility.\r\n\r\nWith such thoughts in his mind, however we may judge them, it is not\r\naltogether surprising that in seeking an ecclesiastical governor for an\r\ninstitution to him the most sacred and beloved of all forms of human\r\nassociation, Mr. Gladstone should have cared very little whether the\r\npersonage best fitted in spirituals was quite of the right shade as to\r\nstate temporals. The labour that he now expended on finding the best man\r\nis attested by voluminous correspondence. Dean Church, who was perhaps the\r\nmost freely consulted by the prime minister, says, “Of one thing I am\r\nquite certain, that never for hundreds of years has so much honest\r\ndisinterested pains been taken to fill the primacy—such inquiry and\r\ntrouble resolutely followed out to find the really fittest man, apart from\r\nevery personal and political consideration, as in this case.”(63)\r\n\r\nAnother ecclesiastical vacancy that led to volumes of correspondence was\r\nthe deanery of Westminster the year before. In the summer of 1881 Dean\r\nStanley died, and it is interesting to note how easy Mr. Gladstone found\r\nit to do full justice to one for whom as erastian and latitudinarian he\r\ncould in opinion have such moderate approval. In offering to the Queen his\r\n“cordial sympathy” for the friend whom she had lost, he told her how early\r\nin his own life and earlier still in the dean’s he had opportunities of\r\nwatching the development of his powers, for they had both been educated at\r\na small school near the home of Mr. Gladstone’s boyhood.(64) He went on to\r\nspeak of Stanley’s boundless generosity and brilliant gifts, his genial\r\nand attaching disposition. “There may be,” he said, “and must be much\r\ndiversity as to parts of the opinions of Dean Stanley, but he will be long\r\nremembered as one who was capable of the deepest and widest love, and who\r\nreceived it in return.”\r\n\r\nFar away from these regions of what he irreverently called the shovel hat,\r\nabout this time Carlyle died (Feb. 4, 1881), a firm sympathiser with Mr.\r\nGladstone in his views of the unspeakable Turk, but in all else the rather\r\nboisterous preacher of a gospel directly antipathetic. “Carlyle is at\r\nleast a great fact in the literature of his time; and has contributed\r\nlargely, in some respects too largely, towards forming its characteristic\r\nhabits of thought.” So Mr. Gladstone wrote in 1876, in a highly\r\ninteresting parallel between Carlyle and Macaulay—both of them honest, he\r\nsaid, both notwithstanding their honesty partisans; both of them, though\r\nvariously, poets using the vehicle of prose; both having the power of\r\npainting portraits extraordinary for vividness and strength; each of them\r\nvastly though diversely powerful in expression, each more powerful in\r\nexpression than in thought; neither of them to be resorted to for\r\ncomprehensive disquisition, nor for balanced and impartial judgments.(65)\r\nPerhaps it was too early in 1876 to speak of Carlyle as forming the\r\ncharacteristic habits of thought of his time, but undoubtedly now when he\r\ndied, his influence was beginning to tell heavily against the speculative\r\nliberalism that had reigned in England for two generations, with enormous\r\nadvantage to the peace, prosperity and power of (M39) the country and the\r\ntwo generations concerned. Half lights and half truths are, as Mr.\r\nGladstone implies, the utmost that Carlyle’s works were found to yield in\r\nphilosophy and history, but his half lights pointed in the direction in\r\nwhich men for more material reasons thought that they desired to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nA reconstruction of the ministry had become necessary by his own\r\nabandonment of the exchequer. For one moment it was thought that Lord\r\nHartington might become chancellor, leaving room for Lord Derby at the\r\nIndia office, but Lord Derby was not yet ready to join. In inviting Mr.\r\nChilders to take his place as chancellor of the exchequer, Mr. Gladstone\r\ntold him (Dec. 1, 1882): “The basis of my action is not so much a desire\r\nto be relieved from labour, as an anxiety to give the country a much\r\nbetter finance minister than myself,—one whose eyes will be always ranging\r\nfreely and vigilantly over the whole area of the great establishments, the\r\npublic service and the laws connected with his office, for the purposes of\r\nimprovement and of good husbandry.”\r\n\r\nThe claim of Sir Charles Dilke to a seat in the cabinet had become\r\nirresistible alike by his good service as undersecretary at the foreign\r\noffice, and by his position out of doors; and as the admission of a\r\nradical must be balanced by a whig—so at least it was judged—Mr. Gladstone\r\nsucceeded in inducing Lord Derby to join, though he had failed with him\r\nnot long before.(66)\r\n\r\nApart from general objections at court, difficulties arose about the\r\ndistribution of office. Mr. Chamberlain, who has always had his full share\r\nof the virtues of staunch friendship, agreed to give up to Sir C. Dilke\r\nhis own office, which he much liked, and take the duchy, which he did not\r\nlike at all. In acknowledging Mr. Chamberlain’s letter (Dec. 14) Mr.\r\nGladstone wrote to him, “I shall be glad, if I can, to avoid acting upon\r\nit. But I cannot refrain from at once writing a hearty line to acknowledge\r\nthe self-sacrificing spirit in which it is written; and which, I am sure,\r\nyou will never see cause to repent or change.” This, however, was found to\r\nbe no improvement, for Mr. Chamberlain’s language about ransoms to be paid\r\nby possessors of property, the offence of not toiling and spinning, and\r\nthe services rendered by courtiers to kings, was not much less repugnant\r\nthan rash assertions about the monarch evading the income-tax. All\r\ncontention on personal points was a severe trial to Mr. Gladstone, and any\r\nconflict with the wishes of the Queen tried him most of all. One of his\r\naudiences upon these affairs Mr. Gladstone mentions in his diary: “Dec.\r\n11.—Off at 12.45 to Windsor in the frost and fog. Audience of her Majesty\r\nat 3. Most difficult ground, but aided by her beautiful manners, we got\r\nover it better than might have been expected.” The dispute was stubborn,\r\nbut like all else it came to an end; colleagues were obliging, holes and\r\npegs were accommodated, and Lord Derby went to the colonial office, and\r\nSir C. Dilke to the local government board. An officer of the court, who\r\nwas in all the secrets and had foreseen all the difficulties, wrote that\r\nthe actual result was due “to the judicious manner in which Mr. Gladstone\r\nmanaged everything. He argued in a friendly way, urging his views with\r\nmoderation, and appealed to the Queen’s sense of courtesy.”\r\n\r\nIn the course of his correspondence with the Queen, the prime minister\r\ndrew her attention (Dec. 18) to the fact that when the cabinet was formed\r\nit included three ministers reputed to belong to the radical section, Mr.\r\nBright, Mr. Forster, and Mr. Chamberlain, and of these only the last\r\nremained. The addition of Lord Derby was an addition drawn from the other\r\nwing of the party. Another point presented itself. The cabinet originally\r\ncontained eight commoners and six peers. There were now seven peers and\r\nsix commoners. This made it requisite to add a commoner. As for Mr.\r\nChamberlain, the minister assured the Queen that though he had not yet,\r\nlike Mr. Bright, undergone the mollifying influence of age and experience,\r\nhis leanings on foreign policy would be far more acceptable to her Majesty\r\nthan those of Mr. Bright, while his views were not known to be any more\r\ndemocratic in principle. He further expressed his firm opinion (Dec. 22)\r\n(M40) that though Lord Derby might on questions of peace and war be some\r\nshades nearer to the views of Mr. Bright than the other members of the\r\ncabinet, yet he would never go anything like the length of Mr. Bright in\r\nsuch matters. In fact, said Mr. Gladstone, the cabinet must be deemed a\r\nlittle less pacific now than it was at its first formation. This at least\r\nwas a consolatory reflection.\r\n\r\nMinisterial reconstruction is a trying moment for the politician who\r\nthinks himself “not a favourite with his stars,” and is in a hurry for a\r\nbox seat before his time has come. Mr. Gladstone was now harassed with\r\nsome importunities of this kind.(67) Personal collision with any who stood\r\nin the place of friends was always terrible to him. His gift of sleep\r\ndeserted him. “It is disagreeable to talk of oneself,” he wrote to Lord\r\nGranville (Jan. 2, 1883), “when there is so much of more importance to\r\nthink and speak about, but I am sorry to say that the incessant strain and\r\npressure of work, and especially the multiplication of these personal\r\nquestions, is overdoing me, and for the first time my power of sleep is\r\nseriously giving way. I dare say it would soon right itself if I could\r\noffer it any other medicine than the medicine in Hood’s ‘Song of the\r\nShirt.’ ” And the next day he wrote: “Last night I improved, 3-½-hours to\r\n4-½, but this is different from 7 and 8, my uniform standard through\r\nlife.” And two days later: “The matter of sleep is with me a very grave\r\none. I am afraid I may have to go up and consult Clark. My habit has\r\nalways been to reckon my hours rather exultingly, and say how little I am\r\nawake. It is not impossible that I may have to ask you to meet me in\r\nLondon, but I will not do this except in necessity. I think that, to\r\nconvey a clear idea, I should say I attach no importance to the broken\r\nsleep itself; it is the state of the brain, tested by my own sensations,\r\nwhen I begin my work in the morning, which may make me need higher\r\nassurance.” Sir Andrew Clark, “overflowing with kindness, as always,” went\r\ndown to Hawarden (Jan. 7), examined, and listened to the tale of heavy\r\nwakeful nights. While treating the case as one of temporary and accidental\r\nderangement, he instantly forbade a projected expedition to Midlothian,\r\nand urged change of air and scene.\r\n\r\nThis prohibition eased some of the difficulties at Windsor, where\r\nMidlothian was a name of dubious association, and in announcing to the\r\nQueen the abandonment by Dr. Clark’s orders of the intended journey to the\r\nnorth, Mr. Gladstone wrote (Jan. 8, 1883):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    In your Majesty’s very kind reference on the 5th to his former\r\n    visits to Midlothian, and to his own observations on the 24th\r\n    April 1880, your Majesty remarked that he had said he did not then\r\n    think himself a responsible person. He prays leave to fill up the\r\n    outline which these words convey by saying he at that time (to the\r\n    best of his recollection) humbly submitted to your Majesty his\r\n    admission that he must personally bear the consequences of all\r\n    that he had said, and that he thought some things suitable to be\r\n    said by a person out of office which could not suitably be said by\r\n    a person in office; also that, as is intimated by your Majesty’s\r\n    words, the responsibilities of the two positions severally were\r\n    different. With respect to the political changes named by your\r\n    Majesty, Mr. Gladstone considers that the very safe measure of\r\n    extending to the counties the franchise enjoyed by the boroughs\r\n    stands in all likelihood for early consideration; but he doubts\r\n    whether there can be any serious dealing of a general character\r\n    with the land laws by the present parliament, and so far as\r\n    Scottish disestablishment is concerned he does not conceive that\r\n    that question has made progress during recent years; and he may\r\n    state that in making arrangements recently for his expected visit\r\n    to Midlothian, he had received various overtures for deputations\r\n    on this subject, which he had been able to put aside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nOn January 17, along with Mrs. Gladstone, at Charing Cross he said\r\ngood-bye to many friends, and at Dover to Lord Granville, and the\r\nfollowing afternoon he found himself at Cannes, the guest of the\r\nWolvertons at the Château (M41) Scott, “nobly situated, admirably planned,\r\nand the kindness exceeded even the beauty and the comfort.” “Here,” he\r\nsays, “we fell in with the foreign hours, the snack early, déjeuner at\r\nnoon, dinner at seven, break-up at ten.... I am stunned by this wonderful\r\nplace, and so vast a change at a moment’s notice in the conditions of\r\nlife.” He read steadily through the _Odyssey_, Dixon’s _History of the\r\nChurch of England_, Scherer’s _Miscellanies_, and _The Life of\r\nClerk-Maxwell_, and every day he had long talks and walks with Lord Acton\r\non themes personal, political and religious—and we may believe what a\r\nrestorative he found in communion with that deep and well-filled mind—that\r\n“most satisfactory mind,” as Mr. Gladstone here one day calls it. He took\r\ndrives to gardens that struck him as fairyland. The Prince of Wales paid\r\nhim kindly attentions as always. He had long conversations with the Comte\r\nde Paris, and with M. Clémenceau, and with the Duke of Argyll, the oldest\r\nof his surviving friends. In the evening he played whist. Home affairs he\r\nkept at bay pretty successfully, though a speech of Lord Hartington’s\r\nabout local government in Ireland drew from him a longish letter to Lord\r\nGranville that the reader, if he likes, will find elsewhere.(68) His\r\nconversation with M. Clémenceau (whom he found “decidedly pleasing”) was\r\nthought indiscreet, but though the most circumspect of men, the buckram of\r\na spurious discretion was no favourite wear with Mr. Gladstone. As for the\r\nreport of his conversation with the French radical, he wrote to Lord\r\nGranville, “It includes much which Clémenceau did not say to me, and omits\r\nmuch which he did, for our principal conversation was on Egypt, about\r\nwhich he spoke in a most temperate and reasonable manner.” He read the\r\n“harrowing details” of the terrible scene in the court-house at\r\nKilmainham, where the murderous Invincibles were found out. “About Carey,”\r\nhe said to Lord Granville, “the spectacle is indeed loathsome, but I\r\ncannot doubt that the Irish government are distinctly _right_. In\r\naccepting an approver you do not incite him to do what is in itself wrong;\r\nonly his own bad mind can make it wrong to him. The government looks for\r\nthe truth. Approvers are, I suppose, for the most part base, but I do not\r\nsee how you could act on a distinction of degree between them. Still, one\r\nwould have heard the hiss from the dock with sympathy.”\r\n\r\nLord Granville wrote to him (Jan. 31, 1883) that the Queen insisted much\r\nupon his diminishing the amount of labour thrown upon him, and expressed\r\nher opinion that his acceptance of a peerage would relieve him of the\r\nheavy strain. Lord Granville told her that personally he should be\r\ndelighted to see him in the Lords, but that he had great doubts whether\r\nMr. Gladstone would be willing. From Cannes Mr. Gladstone replied (Feb.\r\n3):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    As to removal into the House of Lords, I think the reasons against\r\n    it of general application are conclusive. At least I cannot see my\r\n    way in regard to them. But at any rate it is obvious that such a\r\n    step is quite inapplicable to the circumstances created by the\r\n    present difficulty. It is really most kind of the Queen to testify\r\n    such an interest, and the question is how to answer her. You would\r\n    do this better and perhaps more easily than I.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps he remembered the case of Pulteney and of the Great Commoner.\r\n\r\nHe was not without remorse at the thought of his colleagues in harness\r\nwhile he was lotus-eating. On the day before the opening of the session he\r\nwrites, “I feel dual: I am at Cannes, and in Downing Street eating my\r\nparliamentary dinner.” By February 21 he was able to write to Lord\r\nGranville:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    As regards my health there is no excuse. It has got better and\r\n    better as I have stayed on, and is now, I think, on a higher level\r\n    than for a long time past. My sleep, for example, is now about as\r\n    good as it can be, and far better than it was during the autumn\r\n    sittings, _after_ which it got so bad. The pleasure I have had in\r\n    staying does not make an argument at all; it is a mere expression\r\n    or anticipation of my desire to be turned out to grass for\r\n    good....\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last the end of the holiday came. “I part from Cannes with a heavy\r\nheart,” he records on Feb. 26:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Read the _Iliad_, copiously. Off by the 12.30 train. We exchanged\r\n    bright sun, splendid views, and a little dust at the beginning of\r\n    our journey, for frost and fog, which however hid no scenery, at\r\n    the end. _27th, Tuesday._—Reached Paris at 8, and drove to the\r\n    Embassy, where we had a most kind reception [from Lord Lyons].\r\n    Wrote to Lord Granville, Lord Spencer, Sir W. Harcourt. Went with\r\n    Lord L. to see M. Grévy; also Challemel-Lacour in his most\r\n    palatial abode. Looked about among the shops; and at the sad face\r\n    of the Tuileries. An embassy party to dinner; excellent company.\r\n\r\n    _To Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    _Feb. 27th._—I have been with Lord Lyons to see Grévy and\r\n    Challemel-Lacour. Grevy’s conversation consisted of civilities and\r\n    a mournful lecture on the political history of France, with many\r\n    compliments to the superiority of England. Challemel thought the\r\n    burdens of public life intolerable and greater here than in\r\n    England, which is rather strong. Neither made the smallest\r\n    allusion to present questions, and it was none of my business to\r\n    introduce them....\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter three days of bookstalls, ivory-hunting, and conversation, by the\r\nevening of March 2 the travellers were once more after a bright day and\r\nrapid passage safe in Downing Street.\r\n\r\nShortly after their return from the south of France the Gladstones paid a\r\nvisit to the Prince and Princess of Wales:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _March 30, 1883._—Off at 11.30 to Sandringham. Reception kinder if\r\n    possible even than heretofore. Wrote.... Read and worked on London\r\n    municipality. _31, Saturday_.—Wrote. Root-cut a small tree in the\r\n    forenoon; then measured oaks in the park; one of 30 feet. In the\r\n    afternoon we drove to Houghton, a stately house and place, but\r\n    woe-begone. Conversation with Archbishop of Canterbury, Prince of\r\n    Wales and others. Read ... _Life of Hatherley_, Law’s account of\r\n    Craig. _April 1._—Sandringham church, morning. West Newton,\r\n    evening. Good services and sermons from the archbishop. The Prince\r\n    bade me read the lessons. Much conversation with the archbishop,\r\n    also Duke of Cambridge. Read _Nineteenth Century_ on Revised\r\n    Version; Manning on Education; _Life of Hatherley_; Craig’s\r\n    _Catechism_. Wrote, etc. 2.—Off at 11. D. Street 3.15. Wrote to\r\n    the Queen. Long conversation with the archbishop in the train.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere a short letter or two may find a place:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Lady Jessel on her husband’s death._\r\n\r\n    _March 30._—Though I am reluctant to intrude upon your sorrow\r\n    still so fresh, and while I beg of you on no account to\r\n    acknowledge this note, I cannot refrain from writing to assure you\r\n    not only of my sympathy with your grief, but of my profound sense\r\n    of the loss which the country and its judiciary have sustained by\r\n    the death of your distinguished husband. From the time of his\r\n    first entrance into parliament I followed his legal expositions\r\n    with an ignorant but fervid admiration, and could not help placing\r\n    him in the first rank, a rank held by few, of the many able and\r\n    powerful lawyers whom during half a century I have known and heard\r\n    in parliament. When I came to know him as a colleague, I found\r\n    reason to admire no less sincerely his superiority to\r\n    considerations of pecuniary interest, his strong and tenacious\r\n    sense of the dignity of his office, and his thoroughly frank,\r\n    resolute, and manly character. These few words, if they be a\r\n    feeble, yet I assure you are also a genuine, tribute to a memory\r\n    which I trust will long be cherished. Earnestly anxious that you\r\n    may have every consolation in your heavy bereavement.\r\n\r\n    _To Cardinal Manning._\r\n\r\n    _April 19._—I thank you much for your kind note, though I am sorry\r\n    to have given you the trouble of writing it. Both of us have much\r\n    to be thankful for in the way of health, but I should have, hoped\r\n    that your extremely spare living would have saved you from the\r\n    action of anything like gouty tendencies. As for myself, I can in\r\n    no way understand how it is that for a full half century I have\r\n    been permitted and enabled to resist a pressure of special\r\n    liabilities attaching to my path of life, to which so many have\r\n    given way. I am left as a solitary, surviving all his compeers.\r\n    But I trust it may not be long ere I escape into some position\r\n    better suited to declining years.\r\n\r\n    _To Sir W. V. Harcourt._\r\n\r\n    _April 27._—A separate line to thank you for your more than kind\r\n    words about my rather Alexandrine speech last night; as to which I\r\n    can only admit that it contained one fine passage—six lines in\r\n    length.(69) Your “instincts” of kindliness in all personal matters\r\n    are known to all the world. I should be glad, on selfish grounds,\r\n    if I could feel sure that they had not a little warped your\r\n    judicial faculty for the moment. But this misgiving abates nothing\r\n    from my grateful acknowledgment.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn application was made to him on behalf of a member of the opposite party\r\nfor a political pension, and here is his reply, to which it may be added\r\nthat ten years later he had come rather strongly to the view that\r\npolitical pensions should be abolished, and he was only deterred from\r\ntrying to carry out his view by the reminder from younger ministers, not\r\nthemselves applicants nor ever likely to be, that it would hardly be a\r\ngracious thing to cut off benefactions at a time when the bestowal of them\r\nwas passing away from him, though he had used them freely while that\r\nbestowal was within his reach.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Political Pensions._\r\n\r\n    _July 4, 1883._—You are probably aware that during the fifty years\r\n    which have passed since the system of political and civil pensions\r\n    was essentially remodelled, no political pension has been granted\r\n    by any minister except to one of those with whom he stood on terms\r\n    of general confidence and co-operation. It is needless to refer to\r\n    older practice.\r\n\r\n    This is not to be accounted for by the fact that after meeting the\r\n    just claims of political adherents, there has been nothing left to\r\n    bestow. For, although it has happened that the list of pensions of\r\n    the first class has usually been full, it has not been so with\r\n    political pensions of the other classes, which have, I think,\r\n    rarely if ever been granted to the fullest extent that the Acts\r\n    have allowed. At the present time, out of twelve pensions which\r\n    may legally be conferred, only seven have been actually given, if\r\n    I reckon rightly. I do not think that this state of facts can have\r\n    been due to the absence of cases entitled to consideration, and I\r\n    am quite certain that it is not to be accounted for by what are\r\n    commonly termed party motives. It was obvious to me that I could\r\n    not create a precedent of deviation from a course undeviatingly\r\n    pursued by my predecessors of all parties, without satisfying\r\n    myself that a new form of proceeding would be reasonable and safe.\r\n    The examination of private circumstances, such as I consider the\r\n    Act to require, is from its own nature difficult and invidious:\r\n    but the examination of competing cases in the ex-official corps is\r\n    a function that could not, I think, be discharged with the\r\n    necessary combination of free responsible action, and of exemption\r\n    from offence and suspicion. Such cases plainly may occur.(70)\r\n\r\n    _To H.R.H. the Prince of Wales._\r\n\r\n    _August 14th._—I am much shocked at an omission which I made last\r\n    night in failing to ask your royal Highness’s leave to be the\r\n    first to quit Lord Alcester’s agreeable party, in order that I\r\n    might attend to my duties in the House of Commons. In my early\r\n    days not only did the whole company remain united, if a member of\r\n    the royal family were present, until the exalted personage had\r\n    departed; but I well recollect the application of the same rule in\r\n    the case of the Archbishop (Howley) of Canterbury. I am sorry to\r\n    say that I reached the House of Commons in time to hear some\r\n    outrageous speeches from the ultra Irish members. I will not say\r\n    that they were meant to encourage crime, but they tended directly\r\n    to teach the Irish people to withhold their confidence from the\r\n    law and its administrators; and they seemed to exhibit Lord\r\n    Spencer as the enemy to the mass of the community—a sad and\r\n    disgraceful fact, though I need not qualify what I told your royal\r\n    Highness, that they had for some time past not been guilty of\r\n    obstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven in pieces that were in their nature more or less official, he touched\r\nthe occasions of life by a note that was not merely official, or was\r\nofficial in its best form. To Mrs. Garfield he wrote (July 21, 1881):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    You will, I am sure, excuse me, though a personal stranger, for\r\n    addressing you by letter, to convey to you the assurance of my own\r\n    feelings and those of my countrymen on the occasion of the late\r\n    horrible attempt to murder the President of the United States, in\r\n    a form more palpable at least than that of messages conveyed by\r\n    telegraph. Those feelings have been feelings in the first instance\r\n    of sympathy, and afterwards of joy and thankfulness, almost\r\n    comparable, and I venture to say only second to the strong\r\n    emotions of the great nation, of which he is the appointed head.\r\n    Individually I have, let me beg you to believe, had my full share\r\n    in the sentiments which have possessed the British nation. They\r\n    have been prompted and quickened largely by what I venture to\r\n    think is the ever-growing sense of harmony and mutual respect and\r\n    affection between the two countries, and of a relationship which\r\n    from year to year becomes more and more a practical bond of union\r\n    between us. But they have also drawn much of their strength from a\r\n    cordial admiration of the simple heroism which has marked the\r\n    personal conduct of the President, for we have not yet wholly lost\r\n    the capacity of appreciating such an example of Christian faith\r\n    and manly fortitude. This exemplary picture has been made complete\r\n    by your own contribution to its noble and touching features, on\r\n    which I only forbear to dwell because I am directly addressing\r\n    you.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder all the conventional solemnities in Mr. Gladstone on such occasions,\r\nwe are conscious of a sincere feeling that they were in real relation to\r\nhuman life and all its chances and changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII. Colleagues—Northern Cruise—Egypt. (1883)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Parran faville della sua virtute\r\n    In non curar d’argento nè d’affanni.\r\n\r\n    —_Paradiso_, xvii. 83.\r\n\r\n    Sparks of his worth shall show in the little heed he gives either\r\n    to riches or to heavy toils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe session of 1883 was marked by one legislative performance of the first\r\norder, the bill devised against corrupt practices at elections. This\r\ninvaluable measure was worked through the House of Commons mainly by Sir\r\nHenry James, the attorney general, whose skill and temper in a business\r\nthat was made none the easier by the fact of every man in the House\r\nsupposing himself to understand the subject, excited Mr. Gladstone’s\r\ncordial admiration; it strengthened that peculiarly warm regard in which\r\nhe held Sir Henry, not only now but even when the evil days of political\r\nseverance came. The prime minister, though assiduous, as he always was, in\r\nthe discharge of those routine and secondary duties which can never be\r\nneglected without damage to the House, had, for the first session in his\r\ncareer as head of a government, no burden in the shaping of a great bill.\r\nHe insisted, in spite of some opposition in the cabinet, on accepting a\r\nmotion pledging parliament to economy (April 3). In a debate on the Congo,\r\nhe was taken by some to have gone near to giving up the treaty-making\r\npower of the crown. He had to face more than one of those emergencies that\r\nwere naturally common for the leader of a party with a zealous radical\r\nwing represented in his cabinet, and in some measure these occasions beset\r\nMr. Gladstone from 1869 (M42) onwards. His loyalty and kindness to\r\ncolleagues who got themselves and him into scrapes by imprudent speeches,\r\nand his activity and resource in inventing ways out of scrapes, were\r\nalways unfailing. Often the difficulty was with the Queen, sometimes with\r\nthe House of Lords, occasionally with the Irish members. Birmingham, for\r\ninstance, held a grand celebration (June 13) on the twenty-fifth\r\nanniversary of Mr. Bright’s connection as its representative. Mr. Bright\r\nused strong language about “Irish rebels,” and then learned that he would\r\nbe called to account. He consulted Mr. Gladstone, and from him received a\r\nreply that exhibits the use of logic as applied to inconvenient displays\r\nof the sister art of rhetoric:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Mr. Bright._\r\n\r\n    _June 15, 1883._—I have received your note, and I am extremely\r\n    sorry either that you should have personal trouble after your\r\n    great exertions, or that anything should occur to cloud the\r\n    brilliancy or mar the satisfaction of your recent celebration in\r\n    Birmingham. I have looked at the extract from your speech, which\r\n    is to be alleged as the _corpus delicti_, with a jealous eye. It\r\n    seems well to be prepared for the worst. The points are, I think,\r\n    _three_:—1. “Not a few” tories are guilty of determined\r\n    obstruction. I cannot conceive it possible that this can be deemed\r\n    a breach of privilege. 2. These members are found ’in alliance’\r\n    with the Irish party. Alliance is often predicated by those who\r\n    disapprove, upon the ground that certain persons have been voting\r\n    together. This I think can hardly be a breach of privilege even in\r\n    cases where it may be disputable or untrue.\r\n\r\n    But then: 3. This Irish party are “rebels” whose oath of\r\n    allegiance is broken by association with the enemies of the\r\n    country. Whether these allegations are true or not, the following\r\n    questions arise:—(a) Can they be proved; (b) Are they allegations\r\n    which would be allowed in debate? I suppose you would agree with\r\n    me that they cannot be proved; and I doubt whether they would be\r\n    allowed in debate. The question whether they are a breach of\r\n    privilege is for the House; but the Speaker would have to say, if\r\n    called upon, whether they were allowable in debate. My impression\r\n    is that he would say no; and I think you would not wish to use\r\n    elsewhere expressions that you could not repeat in the House of\r\n    Commons.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Speaker has a jotting in his diary which may end this case of a great\r\nman’s excess:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _June 18._—Exciting sitting. Bright’s language about Irish rebels.\r\n    Certainly his language was very strong and quite inadmissible if\r\n    spoken within the House. In conversation with Northcote I\r\n    deprecated the taking notice of language outside the House, though\r\n    I could not deny that the House, if it thought fit, might regard\r\n    the words as a breach of privilege. But Northcote was no doubt\r\n    urged by his friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain’s was a heavier business, and led to much correspondence\r\nand difficult conversation in high places. A little of it, containing\r\ngeneral principles, will probably suffice here:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Sir Henry Ponsonby._\r\n\r\n    _June 22.—Re_ Chamberlain’s speech. I am sorry to say I had not\r\n    read the report until I was warned by your letters to Granville\r\n    and to Hamilton, for my sight does not allow me to read largely\r\n    the small type of newspapers. I have now read it, and I must at\r\n    once say with deep regret. We had done our best to keep the Bright\r\n    celebration in harmony with the general tone of opinion by the\r\n    mission which Granville kindly undertook. I am the more sorry\r\n    about this speech, because Chamberlain has this year in parliament\r\n    shown both tact and talent in the management of questions not\r\n    polemical, such as the bankruptcy bill. The speech is open to\r\n    exception from three points of view, as I think—first in relation\r\n    to Bright, secondly in relation to the cabinet, thirdly and most\r\n    especially in relation to the crown, to which the speech did not\r\n    indicate the consciousness of his holding any special relation.\r\n\r\n    _June. 26._—It appeared to me in considering the case of Mr.\r\n    Chamberlain’s speech that by far the best correction would be\r\n    found, if a natural opportunity should offer, in a speech\r\n    differently coloured from himself. I found also that he was\r\n    engaged to preside on Saturday next at the dinner of the Cobden\r\n    Club. I addressed myself therefore to this point, and Mr.\r\n    Chamberlain will revert, on that occasion, to the same line of\r\n    thought.... But, like Granville, I consider that the offence does\r\n    not consist in holding certain opinions, of which in my judgment\r\n    the political force and effect are greatly exaggerated, but in the\r\n    attitude assumed, and the tone and colour given to the speech.\r\n\r\n    _To Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    _July 1, 1883._—I have read with care Chamberlain’s speech of last\r\n    night [at the Cobden Club dinner].... Am I right or wrong in\r\n    understanding the speech as follows? He admits without stint that\r\n    in a cabinet concessions may be made as to action, but he seems to\r\n    claim an unlimited liberty of speech. Now I should be as far as\r\n    possible from asserting that under all circumstances speech must\r\n    be confined within the exact limits to which action is tied down.\r\n    But I think the dignity and authority, not to say the honour and\r\n    integrity, of government require that the liberty of speaking\r\n    beyond those limits should be exercised sparingly, reluctantly,\r\n    and with much modesty and reserve. Whereas Chamberlain’s\r\n    Birmingham speech exceeded it largely, gratuitously, and with a\r\n    total absence of recognition of the fact that he was not an\r\n    individual but a member of a body. And the claim made last night\r\n    to liberty of speech must be read with the practical illustration\r\n    afforded by the Birmingham discourse, which evidently now stands\r\n    as an instance, a sort of moral instance, of the mode in which\r\n    liberty of speech is to be reconciled with limitation of\r\n    action.(71)\r\n\r\n    In order to test the question, must we not bear in mind that the\r\n    liberty claimed in one wing of a cabinet may also be claimed in\r\n    another, and that while one minister says I support this measure,\r\n    though it does not go far enough, another may just as lawfully say\r\n    I support this measure, though it goes too far? For example,\r\n    Argyll agreed to the Disturbance Compensation bill in 1880, mainly\r\n    out of regard to his colleagues and their authority. What if he\r\n    had used in the House of Lords language like that I have just\r\n    supposed? Every extravagance of this kind puts weapons into the\r\n    hands of opponents, and weakens the authority of government, which\r\n    is hardly ever too strong, and is often too weak already.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a letter written some years before when he was leader of the House, Mr.\r\nGladstone on the subject of the internal discipline of a ministerial corps\r\ntold one, who was at that time and now his colleague, a little story:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    As the subject is one of interest, perhaps you will let me mention\r\n    the incident which first obliged me to reflect upon it. Nearly\r\n    thirty years ago, my leader, Sir R. Peel, agreed in the Irish\r\n    Tithes bills to give 25 per cent. of the tithe to the landlord in\r\n    return for that “Commutation.” Thinking this too much (you see\r\n    that twist was then already in me), I happened to say so in a\r\n    private letter to an Irish clergyman. Very shortly after I had a\r\n    note from Peel, which inclosed one from Shaw, his head man in\r\n    Ireland, complaining of my letter as making his work impossible if\r\n    such things were allowed to go on. Sir R. Peel indorsed the\r\n    remonstrance, and I had to sing small. The discipline was very\r\n    tight in those days (and we were in opposition, not in\r\n    government). But it worked well on the whole, and I must say it\r\n    was accompanied on Sir R. Peel’s part with a most rigid regard to\r\n    rights of all kinds within the official or quasi-official corps,\r\n    which has somewhat declined in more recent times.\r\n\r\n\r\nA minister had made some reference in a public speech, to what happened in\r\nthe cabinet of which he was a member. “I am sure it cannot have occurred\r\nto you,” Mr. Gladstone wrote, “that the cabinet is the operative part of\r\nthe privy council, that the privy councillor’s oath is applicable to its\r\nproceedings, that this is a very high obligation, and that no one can\r\ndispense with it except the Queen. I may add that I believe no one is\r\nentitled even to make a note of the proceedings except the prime minister,\r\nwho has to report its proceedings on every occasion of its meeting to the\r\nQueen, and who must by a few scraps assist his memory.”\r\n\r\nBy the end of the session, although its labours had not (M43) been on the\r\nlevel of either 1881 or 1882, Mr. Gladstone was somewhat strained. On Aug.\r\n22 he writes to Mrs. Gladstone at Hawarden: “Yesterday at 4½ I entered the\r\nHouse hoping to get out soon and write you a letter, when the Speaker told\r\nme Northcote was going to raise a debate on the Appropriation bill, and I\r\nhad to wait, listen, and then to speak for more than an hour, which tired\r\nme a good deal, finding me weak after sitting till 2.30 the night before,\r\nand a long cabinet in the interval. Rough work for 73!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn September he took a holiday in a shape that, though he was no hearty\r\nsailor, was always a pleasure and a relief to him. Three letters to the\r\nQueen tell the story, and give a glimpse of court punctilio:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _On the North Sea, Sept. 15. Posted at Copenhagen, Sept. 16,\r\n    1883._—Mr. Gladstone presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and\r\n    has to offer his humble apology for not having sought from your\r\n    Majesty the usual gracious permission before setting foot on a\r\n    foreign shore. He embarked on the 8th in a steamer of the Castles\r\n    Company under the auspices of Sir Donald Currie, with no more\r\n    ambitious expectation than that of a cruise among the Western\r\n    Isles. But the extraordinary solidity, so to call it, of a very\r\n    fine ship (the _Pembroke Castle_, 4000 tons, 410 feet long) on the\r\n    water, rendering her in no small degree independent of weather,\r\n    encouraged his fellow-voyagers, and even himself, though a most\r\n    indifferent sailor, to extend their views, and the vessel is now\r\n    on the North Sea running over to Christiansand in Norway, from\r\n    whence it is proposed to go to Copenhagen, with the expectation,\r\n    however, of again touching British soil in the middle of next\r\n    week. Mr. Gladstone humbly trusts that, under these circumstances,\r\n    his omission may be excused.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Tennyson, who is one of the party, is an excellent sailor, and\r\n    seems to enjoy himself much in the floating castle, as it may be\r\n    termed in a wider sense than that of its appellation on the\r\n    register. The weather has been variable with a heavy roll from the\r\n    Atlantic at the points not sheltered; but the stormy North Sea has\r\n    on the whole behaved extremely well as regards its two besetting\r\n    liabilities to storm and fog.\r\n\r\n    _Ship __“__Pembroke Castle,__”__ Mouth of the Thames. Sept. 20,\r\n    1883._—Mr. Gladstone with his humble duty reports to your Majesty\r\n    his return this evening from Copenhagen to London. The passage was\r\n    very rapid, and the weather favourable. He had the honour, with\r\n    his wife and daughter and other companions of his voyage, to\r\n    receive an invitation to dine at Fredensborg on Monday. He found\r\n    there the entire circle of illustrious personages who have been\r\n    gathered for some time in a family party, with a very few\r\n    exceptions. The singularly domestic character of this remarkable\r\n    assemblage, and the affectionate intimacy which appeared to\r\n    pervade it, made an impression upon him not less deep than the\r\n    demeanour of all its members, which was so kindly and so simple,\r\n    that even the word condescending could hardly be applied to it.\r\n    Nor must Mr. Gladstone allow himself to omit another striking\r\n    feature of the remarkable picture, in the unrestrained and\r\n    unbounded happiness of the royal children, nineteen in number, who\r\n    appeared like a single family reared under a single roof.\r\n\r\n    [_The royal party, forty in number, visit the ship._]\r\n\r\n    The Emperor of Russia proposed the health of your Majesty. Mr.\r\n    Gladstone by arrangement with your Majesty’s minister at this\r\n    court, Mr. Vivian, proposed the health of the King and Queen of\r\n    Denmark, and the Emperor and Empress of Russia, and the King and\r\n    Queen of the Hellenes. The King of Denmark did Mr. Gladstone the\r\n    honour to propose his health; and Mr. Gladstone in acknowledging\r\n    this toast, thought he could not do otherwise, though no speeches\r\n    had been made, than express the friendly feeling of Great Britain\r\n    towards Denmark, and the satisfaction with which the British\r\n    people recognised the tie of race which unites them with the\r\n    inhabitants of the Scandinavian countries. Perhaps the most\r\n    vigorous and remarkable portion of the British nation had, Mr.\r\n    Gladstone said, been drawn from these countries. After luncheon,\r\n    the senior imperial and royal personages crowded together into a\r\n    small cabin on the deck to hear Mr. Tennyson read two of his\r\n    poems, several of the younger branches clustering round the doors.\r\n    Between 2 and 3, the illustrious party left the _Pembroke Castle_,\r\n    and in the midst of an animated scene, went on board the King of\r\n    Denmark’s yacht, which steamed towards Elsinore.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gladstone was much pleased to observe that the Emperor of\r\n    Russia appeared to be entirely released from the immediate\r\n    pressure of his anxieties supposed to weigh much upon his mind.\r\n    The Empress of Russia has the genial and gracious manners which on\r\n    this, and on every occasion, mark H.R.H. the Princess of Wales.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\n    _Sept. 22, 1883._—Mr. Gladstone presents his humble duty to your\r\n    Majesty, and has to acknowledge your Majesty’s letter of the 20th\r\n    “giving him full credit for not having reflected at the time” when\r\n    he decided, as your Majesty believes, to extend his recent cruise\r\n    to Norway and Denmark.\r\n\r\n    He may humbly state that he had no desire or idea beyond a glance,\r\n    if only for a few hours, at a little of the fine and peculiar\r\n    scenery of Norway. But he is also responsible for having\r\n    acquiesced in the proposal (which originated with Mr. Tennyson) to\r\n    spend a day at Copenhagen, where he happens to have some\r\n    associations of literary interest; for having accepted an\r\n    unexpected invitation to dine with the king some thirty miles off;\r\n    and for having promoted the execution of a wish, again\r\n    unexpectedly communicated to him, that a visit of the illustrious\r\n    party to the _Pembroke Castle_ should be arranged. Mr. Gladstone\r\n    ought probably to have foreseen all these things. With respect to\r\n    the construction put upon his act abroad, Mr. Gladstone ought\r\n    again, perhaps, to have foreseen that, in countries habituated to\r\n    more important personal meetings, which are uniformly declared to\r\n    be held in the interests of general peace, his momentary and\r\n    unpremeditated contact with the sovereigns at Fredensborg would be\r\n    denounced, or suspected of a mischievous design. He has, however,\r\n    some consolation in finding that, in England at least, such a\r\n    suspicion appears to have been confined to two secondary journals,\r\n    neither of which has ever found (so far as he is aware) in any act\r\n    of his anything but guilt and folly.\r\n\r\n    Thus adopting, to a great extent, your Majesty’s view, Mr.\r\n    Gladstone can confirm your Majesty’s belief that (with the\r\n    exception of a sentence addressed by him to the King of the\r\n    Hellenes singly respecting Bulgaria), there was on all hands an\r\n    absolute silence in regard to public affairs....\r\n\r\n\r\nIn proposing at Kirkwall the health of the poet who was his fellow-guest\r\non the cruise, Mr. Gladstone let fall a hint—a significant and perhaps a\r\njust one—on the comparative place of politics and letters, the difference\r\nbetween the statesman and orator and the poet. “Mr. Tennyson’s life and\r\nlabour,” he said, “correspond in point of time as nearly as possible to my\r\nown; but he has worked in a higher field, and his work will be more\r\ndurable. We public men play a part which places us much in view of our\r\ncountrymen, but the words which we speak have wings and fly away and\r\ndisappear.... But the Poet Laureate has written his own song on the hearts\r\nof his countrymen that can never die.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was said in 1884 that the organisation of Egypt was a subject, whether\r\nregarded from the English or the European point of view, that was probably\r\nmore complicated and more fraught with possible dangers in the future,\r\nthan any question of foreign policy with which England had had to deal for\r\nthe last fifty years or more.\r\n\r\nThe arguments against prolonged English occupation were tolerably clear.\r\nIt would freeze all cordiality between ourselves and the French. It would\r\nmake us a Mediterranean military power. In case of war, the necessity of\r\nholding Egypt would weaken us. In diplomacy it would expose fresh surface\r\nto new and hostile combinations. Yet, giving their full weight to every\r\none of these considerations, a British statesman was confronted by one of\r\nthose intractable dilemmas that make up the material of a good half of\r\nhuman history. The Khedive could not stand by himself. The Turk would not,\r\nand ought not to be endured for his protector. Some other European power\r\nwould step in and block the English road. Would common prudence in such a\r\ncase suffer England to acquiesce and stand aside? Did not subsisting\r\nobligations also confirm the precepts of policy and self-interest? In many\r\nminds this reasoning was clenched and clamped by the sacrifices that\r\nEngland had made when she took, and took alone, the initial military step.\r\n\r\nEgyptian affairs were one of the heaviest loads that (M44) weighed upon\r\nMr. Gladstone during the whole of 1884. One day in the autumn of this\r\nyear, towards the end of the business before the cabinet, a minister asked\r\nif there was anything else. “No,” said Mr. Gladstone with sombre irony as\r\nhe gathered up his papers, “we have done our Egyptian business, and we are\r\nan Egyptian government.” His general position was sketched in a letter to\r\nLord Granville (Mar. 22, 1884): “In regard to the Egyptian question\r\nproper, I am conscious of being moved by three powerful considerations.\r\n(1) Respect for European law, and for the peace of eastern Europe,\r\nessentially connected with its observance. (2) The just claims of the\r\nKhedive, who has given us no case against him, and his people as connected\r\nwith him. (3) Indisposition to extend the responsibilities of this\r\ncountry. On the first two I feel very stiff. On the third I should have\r\ndue regard to my personal condition as a vanishing quantity.”\r\n\r\nThe question of the continuance of the old dual control by England and\r\nFrance was raised almost immediately after the English occupation began,\r\nbut English opinion supported or stimulated the cabinet in refusing to\r\nrestore a form of co-operation that had worked well originally in the\r\nhands of Baring and de Blignières, but had subsequently betrayed its\r\ninherent weakness. France resumed what is diplomatically styled liberty of\r\naction in Egypt; and many months were passed in negotiations, the most\r\nentangled in which a British government was ever engaged. Why did not\r\nEngland, impatient critics of Mr. Gladstone and his cabinet inquire, at\r\nonce formally proclaim a protectorate? Because it would have been a direct\r\nbreach of her moral obligations of good faith to Europe. These were\r\nundisputed and indisputable. It would have brought her within instant\r\nreach of a possible war with France, for which the sinister and interested\r\napproval of Germany would have been small compensation.\r\n\r\nThe issue lay between annexation and withdrawal,—annexation to be veiled\r\nand indirect, withdrawal to be cautious and conditional. No member of the\r\ncabinet at this time seems to have listened with any favour whatever to\r\nthe mention of annexation. Apart from other objections, it would\r\nundeniably have been a flagrant breach of solemn international\r\nengagements. The cabinet was pledged up to the lips to withdrawal, and\r\nwhen Lord Hartington talked to the House of Commons of the last British\r\nsoldier quitting Egypt in a few months, nobody ever doubted then or since\r\nthat he was declaring the sincere intention of the cabinet. Nor was any\r\ndoubt possible that the intention of the cabinet entirely coincided at\r\nthat time with the opinion and wishes of the general public. The\r\noperations in Egypt had not been popular,(72) and the national temper was\r\nstill as hostile to all expansion as when it cast out Lord Beaconsfield.\r\nWithdrawal, however, was beset with inextricable difficulties. Either\r\nwithdrawal or annexation would have simplified the position and brought\r\nits own advantages. Neither was possible. The British government after\r\nTel-el-Kebir vainly strove to steer a course that would combine the\r\nadvantages of both. Say what they would, military occupation was taken to\r\nmake them responsible for everything that happened in Egypt. This\r\nencouraged the view that they should give orders to Egypt, and make Egypt\r\nobey. But then direct and continuous interference with the Egyptian\r\nadministration was advance in a path that could only end in annexation. To\r\ngovern Egypt from London through a native ministry, was in fact nothing\r\nbut annexation, and annexation in its clumsiest and most troublesome\r\nshape. Such a policy was least of all to be reconciled with the avowed\r\npolicy of withdrawal. To treat native ministers as mere ciphers and\r\npuppets, and then to hope to leave them at the end with authority enough\r\nto govern the country by themselves, was pure delusion.\r\n\r\nSo much for our relations with Egypt internally. Then came Europe and the\r\nPowers, and the regulation of a financial situation of indescribable\r\ncomplexity. “I sometimes fear,” Mr. Gladstone wrote to Lord Granville\r\n(Dec. 8, (M45) 1884), “that some of the foreign governments have the same\r\nnotion of me that Nicholas was supposed to have of Lord Aberdeen. But\r\nthere is no one in the cabinet less disposed than I am to knuckle down to\r\nthem in this Egyptian matter, about which they, except Italy, behave so\r\nill, some of them without excuse.” “As to Bismarck,” he said, “it is a\r\ncase of sheer audacity, of which he has an unbounded stock.” Two months\r\nbefore he had complained to Lord Granville of the same powerful personage:\r\n“Ought not some notice to be taken of Bismarck’s impudent reference to the\r\nEnglish exchequer? Ought you to have such a remark in your possession\r\nwithout protest? He coolly assumes in effect that we are responsible for\r\nall the financial wants and occasions of Egypt.”\r\n\r\nThe sensible reader would resist any attempt to drag him into the\r\nSerbonian bog of Egyptian finance. Nor need I describe either the\r\nprotracted conference of the European Powers, or the mission of Lord\r\nNorthbrook. To this able colleague, Mr. Gladstone wrote on the eve of his\r\ndeparture (Aug. 29, 1884):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I cannot let you quit our shores without a word of valediction.\r\n    Your colleagues are too deeply interested to be impartial judges\r\n    of your mission. But they certainly cannot be mistaken in their\r\n    appreciation of the generosity and courage which could alone have\r\n    induced you to undertake it. Our task in Egypt generally may not\r\n    unfairly be called an impossible task, and with the impossible no\r\n    man can successfully contend. But we are well satisfied that\r\n    whatever is possible, you will achieve; whatever judgment,\r\n    experience, firmness, gentleness can do, will be done. Our\r\n    expectations from the nature of the case must be moderate; but be\r\n    assured, they will not be the measure of our gratitude. All good\r\n    go with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Northbrook’s report when in due time it came, engaged the prime\r\nminister’s anxious consideration, but it could not be carried further.\r\nWhat the Powers might agree to, parliament would not look at. The\r\nsituation was one of the utmost delicacy and danger, as anybody who is\r\naware of the diplomatic embarrassments of it knows. An agreement with\r\nFrance about the Suez Canal came to nothing. A conference upon finance\r\ncame to nothing. Bismarck was out of humour with England, partly from his\r\ndislike of certain exalted English personages and influences at his own\r\ncourt, partly because it suited him that France and England should be bad\r\nfriends, partly because, as he complained, whenever he tried to found a\r\ncolony, we closed in upon him. He preached a sermon on _do ut des_, and\r\nwhile scouting the idea of any real differences with this country, he\r\nhinted that if we could not accommodate him in colonial questions, he\r\nmight not find it in his power to accommodate us in European questions.\r\nMr. Gladstone declared for treating every German claim in an equitable\r\nspirit, but said we had our own colonial communities to consider.\r\n\r\nIn March 1885, after negotiations that threatened to be endless, the\r\nLondon Convention was signed and the riddle of the financial sphinx was\r\nsolved. This made possible the coming years of beneficent reform. The\r\nwonder is, says a competent observer, how in view of the indifference of\r\nmost of the Powers to the welfare of Egypt and the bitter annoyance of\r\nFrance at our position in that country, the English government ever\r\nsucceeded in inducing all the parties concerned to agree to so reasonable\r\nan arrangement.(73)\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as we shall see all too soon, the question of Egypt proper, as\r\nit was then called, had brought up the question of the Soudan, and with it\r\nan incident that made what Mr. Gladstone called “the blackest day since\r\nthe Phœnix Park.” In 1884 the government still seemed prosperous. The\r\nordinary human tendency to croak never dies, especially in the politics of\r\nparty. Men talked of humiliation abroad, ruin at home, agricultural\r\ninterests doomed, trade at a standstill—calamities all obviously due to a\r\ngovernment without spirit, and a majority with no independence. But then\r\nhumiliation, to be sure, only meant jealousy in other countries because we\r\ndeclined to put ourselves in the wrong, and to be hoodwinked into unwise\r\nalliances. Ruin only meant reform without revolution. Doom meant an\r\ninappreciable falling off in the vast volume of our trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII. Reform. (1884)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Decision by majorities is as much an expedient as lighting by gas.\r\n    In adopting it as a rule, we are not realising perfection, but\r\n    bowing to an imperfection. It has the great merit of avoiding, and\r\n    that by a test perfectly definite, the last resort to violence;\r\n    and of making force itself the servant instead of the master of\r\n    authority. But our country rejoices in the belief that she does\r\n    not decide all things by majorities.—GLADSTONE (1858).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\n“The word procedure,” said Mr. Gladstone to a club of young political\r\nmissionaries in 1884, “has in it something homely, and it is difficult for\r\nany one, except those who pass their lives within the walls of parliament,\r\nto understand how vital and urgent a truth it is, that there is no more\r\nurgent demand, there is no aim or purpose more absolutely essential to the\r\nfuture victories and the future efficiency of the House of Commons, than\r\nthat it should effect, with the support of the nation—for it can be\r\neffected in no other way—some great reform in the matter of its\r\nprocedure.” He spoke further of the “absolute and daily-growing necessity\r\nof what I will describe as a great internal reform of the House of\r\nCommons, quite distinct from that reform beyond its doors on which our\r\nhearts are at present especially set.” Reform from within and reform from\r\nwithout were the two tasks, neither of them other than difficult in\r\nthemselves and both made supremely difficult by the extraordinary spirit\r\nof faction at that time animating the minority. The internal reform had\r\nbeen made necessary, as Mr. Gladstone expressed it, by systematised\r\nobstruction, based upon the abuse of ancient and generous rules, under\r\nwhich system the House of Commons “becomes more and more the slave of some\r\nof the poorest and most insignificant among its members.” Forty years\r\nbefore he told the provost of Oriel, “The forms of parliament are little\r\nmore than a mature expression of the principles of justice in their\r\napplication to the proceedings of deliberative bodies, having it for their\r\nobject to secure freedom and reflection, and well fitted to attain that\r\nobject.” These high ideals had been gradually lowered, for Mr. Parnell had\r\nfound out that the rules which had for their object the security of\r\nfreedom and reflection, could be still more effectually wrested to objects\r\nthe very opposite.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Gladstone’s first session (1833) 395 members (the speaker excluded)\r\nspoke, and the total number of speeches was 5765. Fifty years later, in\r\nthe session of 1883, the total number of speeches had risen to 21,160. The\r\nremedies proposed from time to time in this parliament by Mr. Gladstone\r\nwere various, and were the occasion of many fierce and stubborn conflicts.\r\nBut the subject is in the highest degree technical, and only intelligible\r\nto those who, as Mr. Gladstone said, “pass their lives within the walls of\r\nparliament”—perhaps not by any means to all even of them. His papers\r\ncontain nothing of interest or novelty upon the question either of\r\ndevolution or of the compulsory stoppage of debate. We may as well,\r\ntherefore, leave it alone, only observing that the necessity for the\r\nclosure was probably the most unpalatable of all the changes forced on Mr.\r\nGladstone by change in social and political circumstance. To leave the\r\nsubject alone is not to ignore its extreme importance, either in the\r\neffect of revolution in procedure upon the character of the House, and its\r\npower of despatching and controlling national business; or as an\r\nindication that the old order was yielding in the political sphere as\r\neverywhere else to the conditions of a new time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of extending to householders in the country the franchise\r\nthat in 1867 had been conferred on householders in boroughs, had been\r\nfirst pressed with eloquence and resolution by Mr. Trevelyan. In 1876 he\r\nintroduced two resolutions, one for extended franchise, the other for a\r\nnew (M46) arrangement of seats, made necessary by the creation of the new\r\nvoters. In a tory parliament he had, of course, no chance. Mr. Gladstone,\r\nnot naturally any more ardent for change in political machinery than Burke\r\nor Canning had been, was in no hurry about it, but was well aware that the\r\ntriumphant parliament of 1880 could not be allowed to expire without the\r\neffective adoption by the government of proposals in principle such as\r\nthose made by Mr. Trevelyan in 1876. One wing of the cabinet hung back.\r\nMr. Gladstone himself, reading the signs in the political skies, felt that\r\nthe hour had struck; the cabinet followed, and the bill was framed. Never,\r\nsaid Mr. Gladstone, was a bill so large in respect of the numbers to have\r\nvotes; so innocent in point of principle, for it raised no new questions\r\nand sprang from no new principles. It went, he contended and most truly\r\ncontended, to the extreme of consideration for opponents, and avoided\r\nseveral points that had especial attractions for friends. So likewise, the\r\ngeneral principles on which redistribution of seats would be governed,\r\nwere admittedly framed in a conservative spirit.\r\n\r\nThe comparative magnitude of the operation was thus described by Mr.\r\nGladstone (Feb. 28, 1884):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    In 1832 there was passed what was considered a Magna Charta of\r\n    British liberties; but that Magna Charta of British liberties\r\n    added, according to the previous estimate of Lord John Russell,\r\n    500,000, while according to the results considerably less than\r\n    500,000 were added to the entire constituency of the three\r\n    countries. After 1832 we come to 1866. At that time the total\r\n    constituency of the United Kingdom reached 1,364,000. By the bills\r\n    which were passed between 1867 and 1869 that number was raised to\r\n    2,448,000. Under the action of the present law the constituency\r\n    has reached in round numbers what I would call 3,000,000. This\r\n    bill, if it passes as presented, will add to the English\r\n    constituency over 1,300,000 persons. It will add to the Scotch\r\n    constituency, Scotland being at present rather better provided in\r\n    this respect than either of the other countries, over 200,000, and\r\n    to the Irish constituency over 400,000; or in the main, to the\r\n    present aggregate constituency of the United Kingdom taken at\r\n    3,000,000 it will add 2,000,000 more, nearly twice as much as was\r\n    added since 1867, and more than four times as much as was added in\r\n    1832.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bill was read a second time (April 7) by the overwhelming majority of\r\n340 against 210. Even those who most disliked the measure admitted that a\r\nmajority of this size could not be made light of, though they went on in\r\ncharity to say that it did not represent the honest opinion of those who\r\ncomposed it. It was in fact, as such persons argued, the strongest proof\r\nof the degradation brought into our politics by the Act of 1867. “All the\r\nbribes of Danby or of Walpole or of Pelham,” cried one excited critic,\r\n“all the bullying of the Tudors, all the lobbying of George III., would\r\nhave been powerless to secure it in the most corrupt or the most servile\r\ndays of the ancient House of Commons.”(74)\r\n\r\nOn the third reading the opposition disappeared from the House, and on Mr.\r\nGladstone’s prompt initiative it was placed on record in the journals that\r\nthe bill had been carried by a unanimous verdict. It went to the Lords,\r\nand by a majority, first of 59 and then of 50, they put what Mr. Gladstone\r\nmildly called “an effectual stoppage on the bill, or in other words did\r\npractically reject it.” The plain issue, if we can call it plain, was\r\nthis. What the tories, with different degrees of sincerity, professed to\r\ndread was that the election might take place on the new franchise, but\r\nwith an unaltered disposition of parliamentary seats. At heart the bulk of\r\nthem were as little friendly to a lowered franchise in the counties, as\r\nthey had been in the case of the towns before Mr. Disraeli educated them.\r\nBut this was a secret dangerous to let out, for the enfranchised workers\r\nin the towns would never understand why workers in the villages should not\r\nhave a vote. Apart from this, the tory leaders believed that unless the\r\nallotment of seats went with the addition of a couple of million new\r\nvoters, the prospect would be ruinously unfavourable to their party, and\r\nthey offered determined resistance to the chance of a jockeying operation\r\nof this (M47) kind. At least one very eminent man among them had privately\r\nmade up his mind that the proceeding supposed to be designed by their\r\nopponents—their distinct professions notwithstanding—would efface the tory\r\nparty for thirty years to come. Mr. Gladstone and his government on the\r\nother hand agreed, on grounds of their own and for reasons of their own,\r\nthat the two changes should come into operation together. What they\r\ncontended was, that to tack redistribution on to franchise, was to scotch\r\nor kill franchise. “I do not hesitate to say,” Mr. Gladstone told his\r\nelectors, “that those who are opposing us, and making use of this topic of\r\nredistribution of seats as a means for defeating the franchise bill, know\r\nas well as we do that, had we been such idiots and such dolts as to\r\npresent to parliament a bill for the combined purpose, or to bring in two\r\nbills for the two purposes as one measure—I say, they know as well as we\r\ndo, that a disgraceful failure would have been the result of our folly,\r\nand that we should have been traitors to you, and to the cause we had in\r\nhand.”(75) Disinterested onlookers thought there ought to be no great\r\ndifficulty in securing the result that both sides desired. As the Duke of\r\nArgyll put it to Mr. Gladstone, if in private business two men were to\r\ncome to a breach, when standing so near to one another in aim and\r\nprofession, they would be shut up in bedlam. This is just what the\r\njudicious reader will think to-day.\r\n\r\nThe controversy was transported from parliament to the platform, and a\r\nvigorous agitation marked the autumn recess. It was a double agitation.\r\nWhat began as a campaign on behalf of the rural householder, threatened to\r\nend as one against hereditary legislators. It is a well-known advantage in\r\nmovements of this sort to be not only for, but also against, somebody or\r\nsomething; against a minister, by preference, or if not an individual,\r\nthen against a body. A hereditary legislature in a community that has\r\nreached the self-governing stage is an anachronism that makes the easiest\r\nof all marks for mockery and attack, so long as it lasts. Nobody can doubt\r\nthat if Mr. Gladstone had been the frantic demagogue or fretful\r\nrevolutionist that his opponents thought, he now had an excellent chance\r\nof bringing the question of the House of Lords irresistibly to the front.\r\nAs it was, in the midst of the storm raised by his lieutenants and\r\nsupporters all over the country, he was the moderating force, elaborately\r\nappealing, as he said, to the reason rather than the fears of his\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\nOne reproachful passage in his speeches this autumn acquires a rather\r\npeculiar significance in the light of the events that were in the coming\r\nyears to follow. He is dealing with the argument that the hereditary House\r\nprotects the nation against fleeting opinions:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    How is it with regard to the solid and permanent opinion of the\r\n    nation? We have had twelve parliaments since the Reform Act,—I\r\n    have a right to say so, as I have sat in every one of them,—and\r\n    the opinion, the national opinion, has been exhibited in the\r\n    following manner. Ten of those parliaments have had a liberal\r\n    majority. The eleventh parliament was the one that sat from 1841\r\n    to 1847. It was elected as a tory parliament; but in 1846 it put\r\n    out the conservative government of Sir Robert Peel, and put in and\r\n    supported till its dissolution, the liberal government of Lord\r\n    John Russell. That is the eleventh parliament. But then there is\r\n    the twelfth parliament, and that is one that you and I know a good\r\n    deal about [Lord Beaconsfield’s parliament], for we talked largely\r\n    on the subject of its merits and demerits, whichever they may be,\r\n    at the time of the last election. That parliament was, I admit, a\r\n    tory parliament from the beginning to the end. But I want to know,\r\n    looking back for a period of more than fifty years, which\r\n    represented the solid permanent conviction of the nation?—the ten\r\n    parliaments that were elected upon ten out of the twelve\r\n    dissolutions, or the one parliament that chanced to be elected\r\n    from the disorganized state of the liberal party in the early part\r\n    of the year 1874? Well, here are ten parliaments on the one side;\r\n    here is one parliament on the other side.... The House of Lords\r\n    was in sympathy with the one parliament, and was in opposition ...\r\n    to the ten parliaments. And yet you are told, when—we will say for\r\n    forty-five years out of fifty—practically the nation has\r\n    manifested its liberal tendencies by the election of liberal\r\n    parliaments, and once only has chanced to elect a thoroughly tory\r\n    parliament, you are told that it is the thoroughly tory parliament\r\n    that represents the solid and permanent opinion of the\r\n    country.(76)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn time a curious thing, not yet adequately explained, fell out, for the\r\nextension of the franchise in 1867 and now in 1884 resulted in a reversal\r\nof the apparent law of things that had ruled our political parties through\r\nthe epoch that Mr. Gladstone has just sketched. The five parliaments since\r\n1884 have not followed the line of the ten parliaments preceding,\r\nnotwithstanding the enlargement of direct popular power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn August Mr. Gladstone submitted to the Queen a memorandum on the\r\npolitical situation. It was much more elaborate than the ordinary official\r\nsubmissions. Lord Granville was the only colleague who had seen it, and\r\nMr. Gladstone was alone responsible for laying it before the sovereign. It\r\nis a masterly statement of the case, starting from the assumption for the\r\nsake of argument that the tories were right and the liberals wrong as to\r\nthe two bills; then proceeding on the basis of a strongly expressed desire\r\nto keep back a movement for organic change; next urging the signs that\r\nsuch a movement would go forward with irresistible force if the bill were\r\nagain rejected; and concluding thus:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I may say in conclusion that there is no personal act if it be\r\n    compatible with personal honour and likely to contribute to an end\r\n    which I hold very dear, that I would not gladly do for the purpose\r\n    of helping to close the present controversy, and in closing it to\r\n    prevent the growth of one probably more complex and more\r\n    formidable.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis document, tempered, unrhetorical, almost dispassionate, was the\r\nstarting-point of proceedings that, after enormous difficulties had been\r\nsurmounted by patience and perseverance, working through his power in\r\nparliament and his authority in the country, ended in final pacification\r\nand a sound political settlement. It was Mr. Gladstone’s statesmanship\r\nthat brought this pacification into sight and within reach.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was deeply struck both by the force of his arguments and the\r\nearnest tone in which they were pressed. Though doubting whether there was\r\nany strong desire for a change in the position of the House of Lords,\r\nstill she “did not shut her eyes to the possible gravity of the situation”\r\n(Aug. 31). She seemed inclined to take some steps for ascertaining the\r\nopinion of the leaders of opposition, with a view to inducing them to\r\nmodify their programme. The Duke of Richmond visited Balmoral (Sept. 13),\r\nbut when Mr. Gladstone, then himself on Deeside, heard what had passed in\r\nthe direction of compromise, he could only say, “Waste of breath!” To all\r\nsuggestions of a dissolution on the case in issue, Mr. Gladstone said to a\r\nconfidential emissary from Balmoral:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Never will I be a party to dissolving in order to determine\r\n    whether the Lords or the Commons were right upon the Franchise\r\n    bill. If I have anything to do with dissolution, it will be a\r\n    dissolution upon organic change in the House of Lords. Should this\r\n    bill be again rejected in a definite manner, there will be only\r\n    two courses open to me, one to cut out of public life, which I\r\n    shall infinitely prefer; the other to become a supporter of\r\n    organic change in the House of Lords, which I hate and which I am\r\n    making all this fuss in order to avoid. We have a few weeks before\r\n    us to try and avert the mischief. After a second rejection it will\r\n    be too late. There is perhaps the alternative of advising a large\r\n    creation of peers; but to this there are great objections, even if\r\n    the Queen were willing. I am not at present sure that I could\r\n    bring myself to be a party to the adoption of a plan like that of\r\n    1832.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen people talked to him of dissolution as a means of bringing the Lords\r\nto account, he replied in scorn: “A marvellous conception! On such a\r\ndissolution, if the country disapproved of the conduct of its\r\nrepresentatives, it would cashier them; but, if it disapproved of the\r\nconduct of the peers, it would simply have to see them resume their place\r\nof power, to employ it to the best of their ability as opportunity might\r\nserve, in thwarting the desires of the country expressed through its\r\nrepresentatives.”\r\n\r\nIt was reported to Mr. Gladstone that his speeches in (M48) Scotland\r\n(though they were marked by much restraint) created some displeasure at\r\nBalmoral. He wrote to Lord Granville (Sept. 26):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Queen does not know the facts. If she did, she would have\r\n    known that while I have been compelled to deviate from the\r\n    intention, of speaking only to constituents which (with much\r\n    difficulty) I kept until Aberdeen, I have thereby (and again with\r\n    much difficulty in handling the audiences, every one of which\r\n    would have wished a different course of proceeding) been enabled\r\n    to do much in the way of keeping the question of organic change in\r\n    the House of Lords out of the present stage of the controversy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Henry Ponsonby, of course at the Queen’s instigation, was\r\nindefatigable and infinitely ingenious in inventing devices of possible\r\ncompromise between Lords and Commons, or between Lords and ministers, such\r\nas might secure the passing of franchise and yet at the same time secure\r\nthe creation of new electoral areas before the extended franchise should\r\nbecome operative. The Queen repeated to some members of the opposition—she\r\ndid not at this stage communicate directly with Lord Salisbury—the essence\r\nof Mr. Gladstone’s memorandum of August, and no doubt conveyed the\r\nimpression that it had made upon her own mind. Later correspondence\r\nbetween her secretary and the Duke of Richmond set up a salutary ferment\r\nin what had not been at first a very promising quarter.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Gladstone was hard at work in other directions. He was\r\nurgent (Oct. 2) that Lord Granville should make every effort to bring more\r\npeers into the fold to save the bill when it reappeared in the autumn\r\nsession. He had himself “garnered in a rich harvest” of bishops in July.\r\nOn previous occasions he had plied the episcopal bench with political\r\nappeals, and this time he wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _July 2, 1884._—I should have felt repugnance and scruple about\r\n    addressing your Grace at any time on any subject of a political\r\n    nature, if it were confined within the ordinary limits of such\r\n    subjects. But it seems impossible to refuse credit to the\r\n    accounts, which assure us that the peers of the opposition, under\r\n    Lord Salisbury and his coadjutors, are determined to use all their\r\n    strength and influence for the purpose of throwing out the\r\n    Franchise bill in the House of Lords; and thus of entering upon a\r\n    conflict with the House of Commons, from which at each step in the\r\n    proceeding it may probably become more difficult to retire, and\r\n    which, if left to its natural course, will probably develop itself\r\n    into a constitutional crisis of such an order, as has not occurred\r\n    since 1832....\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Tennyson, the possessor of a spiritual power even more than\r\narchiepiscopal, who had now a place among peers temporal, he addressed a\r\nremonstrance (July 6):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    ... Upon consideration I cannot help writing a line, for I must\r\n    hope you will reconsider your intention. The best mode in which I\r\n    can support a suggestion seemingly so audacious is by informing\r\n    you, that all sober-minded conservative peers are in great dismay\r\n    at this wild proceeding of Lord Salisbury; that the ultra-radicals\r\n    and Parnellites, on the other hand, are in a state of glee, as\r\n    they believe, and with good reason, that the battle once begun\r\n    will end in some great humiliation to the House of Lords, or some\r\n    important change in its composition. That (to my knowledge)\r\n    various bishops of conservative leanings are, on this account,\r\n    going to vote with the government—as may be the case with lay\r\n    peers also. That you are the _only_ peer, so far as I know,\r\n    associated with liberal ideas or the liberal party, who hesitates\r\n    to vote against Lord Salisbury.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the later stage of this controversy, Tennyson shot the well-known lines\r\nat him—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Steersman, be not precipitate in thine act\r\n    Of steering, for the river here, my friend,\r\n    Parts in two channels, moving to one end—\r\n    This goes straight forward to the cataract:\r\n    That streams about the bend.\r\n    But tho’ the cataract seems the nearer way,\r\n    Whate’er the crowd on either bank may say,\r\n    Take thou “the bend,” ’twill save thee many a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo a poet who made to his generation such exquisite gifts of beauty and\r\npleasure, the hardest of party-men may pardon unseasonable fears about\r\nfranchise and one-horse constituencies. As matter of fact and in plain\r\nprose, this (M49) taking of the bend was exactly what the steersman had\r\nbeen doing, so as to keep other people out of cataracts.\r\n\r\n“Then why should not Lord Granville try his hand on ambassadors, pressing\r\nthem to save their order from a tempest that must strain and might wreck\r\nit?” To Mr. Chamberlain, who was in his element, or in one of his\r\nelements, Mr. Gladstone wrote (Oct. 8):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I see that Salisbury by his declaration in the _Times_ of\r\n    Saturday, that the Lords are to contend for the simultaneous\r\n    passing of the two bills, has given you an excellent subject for\r\n    denunciation, and you may safely denounce him to your heart’s\r\n    content. But I earnestly hope that you will leave us all elbow\r\n    room on other questions which _may_ arise. If you have seen my\r\n    letters (virtually) to the Queen, I do not think you will have\r\n    found reason for alarm in them. I am sorry that Hartington the\r\n    other day used the word compromise, a word which has never passed\r\n    my lips, though I believe he meant nothing wrong. If we could find\r\n    anything which, though surrendering nothing substantial, would\r\n    build a bridge for honourable and moderate men to retreat by, I am\r\n    sure you would not object to it. But I have a much stronger plea\r\n    for your reserve than any request of my own. It is this, that the\r\n    cabinet has postponed discussing the matter until Wednesday simply\r\n    in order that you may be present and take your share. They meet at\r\n    twelve. I shall venture to count on your doing nothing to narrow\r\n    the ground left open to us, which is indeed but a stinted one.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days later (Oct. 11) the Queen writing to the prime minister was\r\nable to mark a further stage:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Although the strong expressions used by ministers in their recent\r\n    speeches have made the task of conciliation undertaken by the\r\n    Queen a most difficult one, she is so much impressed with the\r\n    importance of the issue at stake, that she has persevered in her\r\n    endeavours, and has obtained from the leaders of the opposition an\r\n    expression of their readiness to negotiate on the basis of Lord\r\n    Hartington’s speech at Hanley. In the hope that this _may_ lead to\r\n    a compromise, the Queen has suggested that Lord Hartington may\r\n    enter into communication with Lord Salisbury, and she trusts, from\r\n    Mr. Gladstone’s telegram received this morning, that he will\r\n    empower Lord Hartington to discuss the possibility of an agreement\r\n    with Lord Salisbury.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn acknowledgment, Mr. Gladstone offered his thanks for all her Majesty’s\r\n“well-timed efforts to bring about an accommodation.” He could not,\r\nhowever, he proceeded, feel sanguine as to obtaining any concession from\r\nthe leaders, but he is very glad that Lord Hartington should try.\r\n\r\nHappily, and as might have been expected by anybody who remembered the\r\naction of the sensible peers who saved the Reform bill in 1832, the rash\r\nand headstrong men in high places in the tory party were not allowed to\r\nhave their own way. Before the autumn was over, prudent members of the\r\nopposition became uneasy. They knew that in substance the conclusion was\r\nforegone, but they knew also that just as in their own body there was a\r\ndivision between hothead and moderate, so in the cabinet they could count\r\nupon a whig section, and probably upon the prime minister as well. They\r\nnoted his words spoken in July, “It is not our desire to see the bill\r\ncarried by storm and tempest. It is our desire to see it win its way by\r\npersuasion and calm discussion to the rational minds of men.”(77)\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Sir Michael Hicks Beach had already, with the knowledge and\r\nwithout the disapproval of other leading men on the tory side, suggested\r\nan exchange of views to Lord Hartington, who was warmly encouraged by the\r\ncabinet to carry on communications, as being a person peculiarly fitted\r\nfor the task, “enjoying full confidence on one side,” as Mr. Gladstone\r\nsaid to the Queen, “and probably more on the other side than any other\r\nminister could enjoy.” These two cool and able men took the extension of\r\ncounty franchise for granted, and their conferences turned pretty\r\nexclusively on redistribution. Sir Michael pressed the separation of urban\r\nfrom rural areas, and what was more specifically important was his\r\nadvocacy of single-member or one-horse constituencies. His own long\r\nexperience of a scattered agricultural division had convinced him that\r\nsuch areas with household suffrage would be unworkable. Lord Hartington\r\nknew the advantage of two-member constituencies (M50) for his party,\r\nbecause they made an opening for one whig candidate and one radical. But\r\nhe did not make this a question of life or death, and the ground was\r\nthoroughly well hoed and raked. Lord Salisbury, to whom the nature of\r\nthese communications had been made known by the colleague concerned, told\r\nhim of the suggestion from the Queen, and said that he and Sir Stafford\r\nNorthcote had unreservedly accepted it. So far the cabinet had found the\r\nseveral views in favour with their opponents as to electoral areas, rather\r\nmore sweeping and radical than their own had been, and they hoped that on\r\nthe basis thus informally laid, they might proceed to the more developed\r\nconversation with the two official leaders. Then the tory ultras\r\ninterposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the last day of October the Queen wrote to Mr. Gladstone from\r\nBalmoral:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Queen thinks that it would be a means of arriving at some\r\n    understanding if the leaders of the parties in both Houses could\r\n    exchange their views personally. The Duke of Argyll or any other\r\n    person unconnected for the present with the government or the\r\n    opposition might be employed in bringing about a meeting, and in\r\n    assisting to solve difficulties. The Queen thinks the government\r\n    should in any project forming the basis of resolutions on\r\n    redistribution to be proposed to the House, distinctly define\r\n    their plans at such a personal conference. The Queen believes that\r\n    were assurance given that the redistribution would not be wholly\r\n    inimical to the prospects of the conservative party, their\r\n    concurrence might be obtained. The Queen feels most strongly that\r\n    it is of the utmost importance that in this serious crisis such\r\n    means, even if unusual, should be tried, and knowing how fully Mr.\r\n    Gladstone recognises the great danger that might arise by\r\n    prolonging the conflict, the Queen _earnestly_ trusts that he will\r\n    avail himself of such means to obviate it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Queen then wrote to Lord Salisbury in the same sense in which she had\r\nwritten to the prime minister. Lord Salisbury replied that it would give\r\nhim great pleasure to consult with anybody the Queen might desire, and\r\nthat in obedience to her commands he would do all that lay in him to bring\r\nthe controversy finally to a just and honourable issue. He went on however\r\nto say, in the caustic vein that was one of his ruling traits, that while\r\ncheerfully complying with the Queen’s wishes, he thought it right to add\r\nthat, so far as his information went, no danger attached to the\r\nprolongation of the controversy for a considerable time, nor did he\r\nbelieve that there was any real excitement in the country about it. The\r\nQueen in replying (Nov. 5) said that she would at once acquaint Mr.\r\nGladstone with what he had said.\r\n\r\nThe autumn session began, and the Franchise bill was introduced again.\r\nThree days later, in consequence of a communication from the other camp,\r\nthe debate on the second reading was conciliatory, but the tories won a\r\nbye-election, and the proceedings in committee became menacing and\r\nclouded. Discrepancies abounded in the views of the opposition upon\r\nredistribution. When the third reading came (Nov. 11), important men on\r\nthe tory side insisted on the production of a Seats bill, and declared\r\nthere must be no communication with the enemy. Mr. Gladstone was\r\nelaborately pacific. If he could not get peace, he said, at least let it\r\nbe recorded that he desired peace. The parleys of Lord Hartington and Sir\r\nMichael Hicks Beach came to an end.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, late one night soon after this (Nov. 14), had a long\r\nconversation with Sir Stafford Northcote at the house of a friend. He had\r\nthe authority of the cabinet (not given for this special interview) to\r\npromise the introduction of a Seats bill before the committee stage of the\r\nFranchise bill in the Lords, provided he was assured that it could be done\r\nwithout endangering or retarding franchise. Northcote and Mr. Gladstone\r\nmade good progress on the principles of redistribution. Then came an\r\nawkward message from Lord Salisbury that the Lords could not let the\r\nFranchise bill through, until they got the Seats bill from the Commons. So\r\nnegotiations were again broken off.\r\n\r\nThe only hope now was that a sufficient number of Lord Salisbury’s\r\nadherents would leave him in the lurch, if he (M51) did not close with\r\nwhat was understood to be Mr. Gladstone’s engagement, to procure and press\r\na Seats bill as soon as ever franchise was out of danger. So it happened,\r\nand the door that had thus been shut, speedily opened. Indirect\r\ncommunication reached the treasury bench that seemed to show the leaders\r\nof opposition to be again alive. There were many surmises, everybody was\r\nexcited, and two great tory leaders in the Lords called on Lord Granville\r\none day, anxious for a _modus vivendi_. Mr. Gladstone in the Commons, in\r\nconformity with a previous decision of the cabinet, declared the\r\nwillingness of the government to produce a bill or explain its provisions,\r\non receiving a reasonable guarantee that the Franchise bill would be\r\npassed before the end of the sittings. The ultras of the opposition still\r\ninsisted on making bets all round that the Franchise bill would not become\r\nlaw; besides betting, they declared they would die on the floor of the\r\nHouse in resisting an accommodation. A meeting of the party was summoned\r\nat the Carlton club for the purpose of declaring war to the knife, and\r\nLord Salisbury was reported to hold to his determination. This resolve,\r\nhowever, proved to have been shaken by Mr. Gladstone’s language on a\r\nprevious day. The general principles of redistribution had been\r\nsufficiently sifted, tested, and compared to show that there was no\r\ninsuperable discrepancy of view. It was made clear to Lord Salisbury\r\ncircuitously, that though the government required adequate assurances of\r\nthe safety of franchise before presenting their scheme upon seats, this\r\ndid not preclude private and confidential illumination. So the bill was\r\nread a second time.\r\n\r\nAll went prosperously forward. On November 19, Lord Salisbury and Sir S.\r\nNorthcote came to Downing Street in the afternoon, took tea with the prime\r\nminister, and had a friendly conversation for an hour in which much ground\r\nwas covered. The heads of the government scheme were discussed and handed\r\nto the opposition leaders. Mr. Gladstone was well satisfied. He was much\r\nstruck, he said after, with the quickness of the tory leader, and found it\r\na pleasure to deal with so acute a man. Lord Salisbury, for his part, was\r\ninterested in the novelty of the proceeding, for no precedent could be\r\nfound in our political or party history for the discussion of a measure\r\nbefore its introduction between the leaders of the two sides. This novelty\r\nstirred his curiosity, while he also kept a sharp eye on the main party\r\nchance. He proved to be entirely devoid of respect for tradition, and Mr.\r\nGladstone declared himself to be a strong conservative in comparison. The\r\nmeetings went on for several days through the various parts of the\r\nquestions, Lord Hartington, Lord Granville, and Sir Charles Dilke being\r\nalso taken into council—the last of the three being unrivalled master of\r\nthe intricate details.\r\n\r\nThe operation was watched with jealous eyes by the radicals, though they\r\nhad their guardians in the cabinet. To Mr. Bright who, having been all his\r\nlife denounced as a violent republican, was now in the view of the new\r\nschool hardly even so much as a sound radical, Mr. Gladstone thought it\r\nwell to write (Nov. 25) words of comfort, if comfort were needed:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I wish to give you the assurance that in the private\r\n    communications which are now going on, liberal principles such as\r\n    we should conceive and term them, are in no danger. Those with\r\n    whom we confer are thinking without doubt of party interests, as\r\n    affected by this or that arrangement, but these are a distinct\r\n    matter, and I am not so good at them as some others; but the\r\n    general proposition which I have stated is I think one which I can\r\n    pronounce with some confidence.... The whole operation is\r\n    essentially delicate and slippery, and I can hardly conceive any\r\n    other circumstance in which it would be justified, but in the\r\n    present very peculiar case I think it is not only warranted, but\r\n    called for.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn November 27 all was well over; and Mr. Gladstone was able to inform the\r\nQueen that “the delicate and novel communications” between the two sets of\r\nleaders had been brought to a happy termination. “His first duty,” he\r\nsaid, “was to tender his grateful thanks to your Majesty for the wise,\r\ngracious, and steady influence on your Majesty’s part, which has so\r\npowerfully contributed to bring about this accommodation, and to avert a\r\nserious crisis of affairs.” He (M52) adds that “his cordial\r\nacknowledgments are due to Lord Salisbury and Sir Stafford Northcote for\r\nthe manner in which they have conducted their difficult communications.”\r\nThe Queen promptly replied: “I gladly and thankfully return your\r\ntelegrams. To be able to be of use is all I care to live for now.” By way\r\nof winding up negotiations so remarkable, Mr. Gladstone wrote to Lord\r\nSalisbury to thank him for his kindness, and to say that he could have\r\ndesired nothing better in candour and equity. Their conversation on the\r\nSeats bill would leave him none but the most agreeable recollections.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was in high good humour, as she had a right to be. She gave Mr.\r\nGladstone ample credit for his conciliatory spirit. The last two months\r\nhad been very trying to her, she said, but she confessed herself repaid by\r\nthe thought that she had assisted in a settlement. Mr. Gladstone’s\r\nseverest critics on the tory side confessed that “they did not think he\r\nhad it in him.” Some friends of his in high places even suggested that\r\nthis would be a good moment for giving him the garter. He wrote to Sir\r\nArthur Gordon (Dec. 5): “The time of this government has been on the whole\r\nthe most stormy and difficult that I have known in office, and the last\r\nsix weeks have been perhaps the most anxious and difficult of the\r\ngovernment.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nOne further episode deserves a section, if the reader will turn back for a\r\nmoment or two. The question whether the extension of the parliamentary\r\nfranchise to rural householders should be limited to Great Britain or\r\nshould apply to the whole kingdom, had been finally discussed in a couple\r\nof morning sittings in the month of May. Nobody who heard it can forget\r\nthe speech made against Irish inclusion by Mr. Plunket, the eloquent\r\ngrandson of the most eloquent of all the orators whom Ireland has sent to\r\nthe imperial senate. He warned the House that to talk of assimilating the\r\nfranchise in Ireland to the franchise in England, was to use language\r\nwithout meaning; that out of seven hundred and sixty thousand inhabited\r\nhouses in Ireland, no fewer than four hundred and thirty-five thousand\r\nwere rated at one pound and under; that those whom the bill would\r\nenfranchise would be taken from a class of whom more than forty per cent.\r\ncould neither read nor write; that the measure would strengthen the hands\r\nof that disloyal party who boasted of their entire indifference to English\r\nopinion, and their undivided obligation to influences which Englishmen\r\nwere wholly unable to realise. Then in a lofty strain Mr. Plunket foretold\r\nthat the measure which they were asked to pass would lead up to, and would\r\nprecipitate, the establishment of a separate Irish nationality. He\r\nreminded his hearers that the empire had been reared not more by the\r\nendurance of its soldiers and sailors than by the sagacity and firmness,\r\nthe common sense and patriotism, of that ancient parliament; and he ended\r\nwith a fervid prayer that the historian of the future might not have to\r\ntell that the union of these three kingdoms on which rested all its honour\r\nand all its power—a union that could never be broken by the force of\r\ndomestic traitor or foreign foe—yielded at last under the pressure of the\r\npolitical ambitions and party exigencies of British statesmen.\r\n\r\nThe orator’s stately diction, his solemn tone, the depth of his\r\nconviction, made a profound impression. Newer parliamentary hands below\r\nthe government gangway, as he went on, asked one another by what arts of\r\nparliamentary defence the veteran minister could possibly deal with this\r\nsearching appeal. Only a quarter of an hour remained. In two or three\r\nminutes Mr. Gladstone had swept the solemn impression entirely away.\r\nContrary to his wont, he began at once upon the top note. With high\r\npassion in his voice, and mastering gesture in his uplifted arm, he dashed\r\nimpetuously upon the foe. What weighs upon my mind is this, he said, that\r\nwhen the future historian speaks of the greatness of this empire, and\r\ntraces the manner in which it has grown through successive generations, he\r\nwill say that in that history there was one chapter of disgrace, and that\r\nchapter of disgrace was the treatment of Ireland. It is the scale of\r\njustice that will determine the issue of the conflict with Ireland, if\r\nconflict there is to be. There is nothing we can do, cried the orator,\r\n(M53) turning to the Irish members, except the imprudence of placing in\r\nyour hands evidence that will show that we are not acting on principles of\r\njustice towards you, that can render you for a moment formidable in our\r\neyes, should the day unfortunately arise when you endeavour to lay hands\r\non this great structure of the British empire. Let us be as strong in\r\nright as we are in population, in wealth, and in historic traditions, and\r\nthen we shall not fear to do justice to Ireland. There is but one mode of\r\nmaking England weak in the face of Ireland—that is by applying to her\r\nprinciples of inequality and principles of injustice.\r\n\r\nAs members sallied forth from the House to dine, they felt that this\r\nvehement improvisation had put the true answer. Mr. Plunket’s fine appeal\r\nto those who had been comrades of the Irish loyalists in guarding the\r\nunion was well enough, yet who but the Irish loyalists had held Ireland in\r\nthe hollow of their hands for generation upon generation, and who but they\r\nwere answerable for the odious and dishonouring failure, so patent before\r\nall the world, to effect a true incorporation of their country in a united\r\nrealm? And if it should happen that Irish loyalists should suffer from\r\nextension of equal civil rights to Irishmen, what sort of reason was that\r\nwhy the principle of exclusion and ascendency which had worked such\r\nmischief in the past, should be persisted in for a long and indefinite\r\nfuture? These views, it is important to observe, were shared, not only by\r\nthe minister’s own party, but by a powerful body among his opponents. Some\r\nof the gentlemen who had been most furious against the government for not\r\nstopping Irish meetings in the autumn of 1883, were now most indignant at\r\nthe bare idea of refusing or delaying a proposal for strengthening the\r\nhands of the very people who promoted and attended such meetings. It is\r\ntrue also that only two or three months before, Lord Hartington had\r\ndeclared that it would be most unwise to deal with the Irish franchise.\r\nStill more recently, Mr. W. H. Smith had declared that any extension of\r\nthe suffrage in Ireland would draw after it “confiscation of property,\r\nruin of industry, withdrawal of capital,—misery, wretchedness, and war.”\r\nThe valour of the platform, however, often expires in the keener air of\r\ncabinet and parliament. It became Lord Hartington’s duty now to move the\r\nsecond reading of provisions which, he had just described as most unwise\r\nprovisions, and Mr. Smith found himself the object of brilliant mockery\r\nfrom the daring leader below the gangway on his own side.\r\n\r\nLord Randolph produced a more serious, though events soon showed it to be\r\nnot any more solid an argument, when he said that the man who lives in a\r\nmud cabin very often has a decent holding, and has money in the savings’\r\nbank besides, and more than that, he is often more fit to take an interest\r\nin politics, and to form a sound view about them, than the English\r\nagricultural labourer. The same speaker proceeded to argue that the Fenian\r\nproclivities of the towns would be more than counterbalanced by the\r\nincreased power given to the peasantry. The incidents of agricultural\r\nlife, he observed, are unfavourable to revolutionary movements, and the\r\npeasant is much more under the proper and legitimate influence of the\r\nRoman catholic priesthood than the lower classes of the towns. On the\r\nwhole, the extension of the franchise to the peasantry of Ireland would\r\nnot be unfavourable to the landlord interest. Yet Lord Randolph, who\r\nregaled the House with these chimerical speculations, had had far better\r\nopportunities than almost any other Englishman then in parliament of\r\nknowing something about Ireland.\r\n\r\nWhat is certain is that English and Scotch members acted with their eyes\r\nopen. Irish tories and Irish nationalists agreed in menacing predictions.\r\nThe vast masses of Irish people, said the former, had no sense of loyalty\r\nand no love of order to which a government could appeal. In many districts\r\nthe only person who was unsafe was the peace officer or the relatives of a\r\nmurdered man. The effect of the change would be the utter annihilation of\r\nthe political power of the most orderly, the most loyal, the most educated\r\nclasses of Ireland, and the swamping of one-fourth of the community,\r\nrepresenting two-thirds of its property. A representative of the great\r\nhouse of Hamilton in the Commons, amid a little cloud of the dishevelled\r\nprophecies (M54) too common in his class, assured the House that everybody\r\nknew that if the franchise in Ireland were extended, the days of home rule\r\ncould not be far distant. The representative of the great house of\r\nBeresford in the Lords, the resident possessor of a noble domain, an able\r\nand determined man, with large knowledge of his country, so far as large\r\nknowledge can be acquired from a single point of view, expressed his\r\nstrong conviction that after the passage of this bill the Irish outlook\r\nwould be blacker than it had ever been before.(78)\r\n\r\nAnother person, far more powerful than any Hamilton or Beresford, was\r\nequally explicit. With characteristic frigidity, precision, and\r\nconfidence, the Irish leader had defined his policy and his expectations.\r\n“Beyond a shadow of doubt,” he had said to a meeting in the Rotunda at\r\nDublin, “it will be for the Irish people in England—separated, isolated as\r\nthey are—and for your independent Irish members, to determine at the next\r\ngeneral election whether a tory or a liberal English ministry shall rule\r\nEngland. This is a great force and a great power. If we cannot rule\r\nourselves, we can at least cause them to be ruled as we choose. This force\r\nhas already gained for Ireland inclusion in the coming Franchise bill. We\r\nhave reason to be proud, hopeful, and energetic.”(79) In any case, he\r\ninformed the House of Commons, even if Ireland were not included in the\r\nbill, the national party would come back seventy-five strong. If household\r\nsuffrage were conceded to Ireland, they would come back ninety strong.(80)\r\nThat was the only difference. Therefore, though he naturally supported\r\ninclusion,(81) it was not at all indispensable to the success of his\r\npolicy, and he watched the proceedings in the committee as calmly as he\r\nmight have watched a battle of frogs and mice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX. The Soudan. (1884-1885)\r\n\r\n\r\n    You can only govern men by imagination: without imagination they\r\n    are brutes.... ’Tis by speaking to the soul that you electrify\r\n    men.—NAPOLEON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the late summer of 1881 a certain native of Dongola, proclaiming\r\nhimself a heaven-inspired Mahdi, began to rally to his banner the wild\r\ntribes of the southern Soudan. His mission was to confound the wicked, the\r\nhypocrite, the unbeliever, and to convert the world to the true faith in\r\nthe one God and his prophet. The fame of the Mahdi’s eloquence, his piety,\r\nhis zeal, rapidly spread. At his ear he found a counsellor, so well known\r\nto us after as the khalifa, and this man soon taught the prophet politics.\r\nThe misrule of the Soudan by Egypt had been atrocious, and the combination\r\nof a religious revival with the destruction of that hated yoke swelled a\r\ncry that was irresistible. The rising rapidly extended, for fanaticism in\r\nsuch regions soon takes fire, and the Egyptian pashas had been sore\r\noppressors, even judged by the rude standards of oriental states. Never\r\nwas insurrection more amply justified. From the first, Mr. Gladstone’s\r\ncurious instinct for liberty disclosed to him that here was a case of “a\r\npeople rightly struggling to be free.” The phrase was mocked and derided\r\nthen and down to the end of the chapter. Yet it was the simple truth.\r\n“During all my political life,” he said at a later stage of Soudanese\r\naffairs, “I am thankful to say that I have never opened my lips in favour\r\nof a domination such as that which has been exercised upon certain\r\ncountries by certain other countries, and I am not going now to begin.”\r\n(M55) “I look upon the possession of the Soudan,” he proceeded, “as the\r\ncalamity of Egypt. It has been a drain on her treasury, it has been a\r\ndrain on her men. It is estimated that 100,000 Egyptians have laid down\r\ntheir lives in endeavouring to maintain that barren conquest.” Still\r\nstronger was the Soudanese side of the case. The rule of the Mahdi was\r\nitself a tyranny, and tribe fought with tribe, but that was deemed an\r\neasier yoke than the sway of the pashas from Cairo. Every vice of eastern\r\nrule flourished freely under Egyptian hands. At Khartoum whole families of\r\nCoptic clerks kept the accounts of plundering raids supported by Egyptian\r\nsoldiers, and “this was a government collecting its taxes.” The function\r\nof the Egyptian soldiers “was that of honest countrymen sharing in the\r\nvillainy of the brigands from the Levant and Asia Minor, who wrung money,\r\nwomen, and drink from a miserable population.”(82) Yet the railing against\r\nMr. Gladstone for saying that the “rebels” were rightly struggling to be\r\nfree could not have been more furious if the Mahdi had been for dethroning\r\nMarcus Aurelius or Saint Louis of France.\r\n\r\nThe ministers at Cairo, however, naturally could not find in their hearts\r\nto withdraw from territory that had been theirs for over sixty years,(83)\r\nalthough in the winter of 1882-3 Colonel Stewart, an able British officer,\r\nhad reported that the Egyptian government was wholly unfit to rule the\r\nSoudan; it had not money enough, nor fighting men enough, nor\r\nadministrative skill enough, and abandonment at least of large portions of\r\nit was the only reasonable course. Such counsels found no favour with the\r\nkhedive’s advisers and agents, and General Hicks, an Indian officer,\r\nappointed on the staff of the Egyptian army in the spring of 1883, was now\r\ndespatched by the government of the khedive from Khartoum, for the\r\nrecovery of distant and formidable regions. If his operations had been\r\nlimited to the original intention of clearing Sennaar of rebels and\r\nprotecting Khartoum, all might have been well. Unluckily some trivial\r\nsuccesses over the Mahdi encouraged the Cairo government to design an\r\nadvance into Kordofan, and the reconquest of all the vast wildernesses of\r\nthe Soudan. Lord Dufferin, Sir E. Malet, Colonel Stewart, were all of them\r\nclear that to attempt any such task with an empty chest and a worthless\r\narmy was madness, and they all argued for the abandonment of Kordofan and\r\nDarfur. The cabinet in London, fixed in their resolve not to accept\r\nresponsibility for a Soudan war, and not to enter upon that responsibility\r\nby giving advice for or against the advance of Hicks, stood aloof.(84) In\r\nview of all that followed later, and of their subsequent adoption of the\r\npolicy of abandoning the Soudan, British ministers would evidently have\r\nbeen wiser if they had now forbidden an advance so pregnant with disaster.\r\nEvents showed this to have been the capital miscalculation whence all else\r\nof misfortune followed. The sounder the policy of abandonment, the\r\nstronger the reasons for insisting that the Egyptian government should not\r\nundertake operations inconsistent with that policy. The Soudan was not\r\nwithin the sphere of our responsibility, but Egypt was; and just because\r\nthe separation of Egypt from the Soudan was wise and necessary, it might\r\nhave been expected that England would peremptorily interpose to prevent a\r\ndeparture from the path of separation. What Hicks himself, a capable and\r\ndauntless man, thought of the chances we do not positively know, but he\r\nwas certainly alive to the risks of such a march with such material. On\r\nNovember 5 (1883) the whole force was cut to pieces, the victorious\r\ndervishes were free to advance northwards, and the loose fabric of\r\nEgyptian authority was shattered to the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M56) The three British military officers in Cairo all agreed that the\r\nEgyptian government could not hold Khartoum if the Mahdi should draw down\r\nupon it; and unless a British, an Indian, or a Turkish force came to the\r\nrescue, abandonment of the Soudan was the only possible alternative. The\r\nLondon cabinet decided that they would not employ British or Indian troops\r\nin the Soudan, and though they had no objection to the resort to the Turks\r\nby Egypt, if the Turks would pay their own expenses (a condition fatal to\r\nany such resort), they strongly recommended the khedive to abandon all\r\nterritory south of Assouan or Wady-Halfa. Sir Evelyn Baring, who had now\r\nassumed his post upon a theatre where he was for long years to come to\r\nplay the commanding part, concurred in thinking that the policy of\r\ncomplete abandonment was the best admitted by the circumstances. It is the\r\nway of the world to suppose that because a given course is best, it must\r\ntherefore be possible and ought to be simple. Baring and his colleagues at\r\nCairo were under no such illusion, but it was the foundation of most of\r\nthe criticism that now broke forth in the English press.\r\n\r\nThe unparalleled difficulties that ultimately attended the evacuation of\r\nthe Soudan naturally led inconsiderate critics,—and such must ever be the\r\nmajority,—to condemn the policy and the cabinet who ordered it. So apt are\r\nmen in their rough judgments on great disputable things, to mistake a mere\r\nimpression for a real opinion; and we must patiently admit that the\r\nResult—success or failure in the Event—is the most that they have time\r\nfor, and all that they can go by. Yet two remarks are to be made upon this\r\nfacile censure. The first is that those who knew the Soudan best, approved\r\nmost. On January 22, 1884, Gordon wrote to Lord Granville that the Soudan\r\never was and ever would be a useless possession, and that he thought the\r\nQueen’s ministers “fully justified in recommending evacuation, inasmuch as\r\nthe sacrifices necessary towards securing good government would be far too\r\nonerous to admit of such an attempt being made.” Colonel Stewart quite\r\nagreed, and added the exclamation that nobody who had ever visited the\r\nSoudan could escape the reflection, “What a useless possession and what a\r\nhuge encumbrance on Egypt!” As we shall see, the time soon came when\r\nGordon accepted the policy of evacuation, even with an emphasis of his\r\nown. The second remark is that the reconquest of the Soudan and the\r\nholding of Khartoum were for the Egyptian government, if left to its own\r\nresources, neither more nor less than impossible; these objects, whether\r\nthey were good objects or bad, not only meant recourse to British troops\r\nfor the first immense operations, but the retention of them in a huge and\r\nmost inhospitable region for an indefinite time. A third consideration\r\nwill certainly not be overlooked by anybody who thinks on the course of\r\nthe years of Egyptian reform that have since elapsed, and constitute so\r\nremarkable a chapter of British administration,—namely, that this\r\nbeneficent achievement would have been fatally clogged, if those who\r\nconducted it had also had the Soudan on their hands. The renovation or\r\nreconstruction of what is called Egypt proper, its finances, its army, its\r\ncivil rule, would have been absolutely out of reach, if at the same time\r\nits guiding statesmen had been charged with the responsibilities\r\nrecovering and holding that vaster tract which had been so rashly acquired\r\nand so mercilessly misgoverned. This is fully admitted by those who have\r\nhad most to do with the result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe policy of evacuation was taken as carrying with it the task of\r\nextricating the Egyptian garrisons. This aim induced Mr. Gladstone’s\r\ncabinet once more to play an active military part, though Britain had no\r\nshare in planting these garrisons where they were. Wise men in Egypt were\r\nof the same mind as General Gordon, that in the eastern Soudan it would\r\nhave been better for the British government to keep quiet, and “let events\r\nwork themselves out.” Unfortunately the ready clamour of headlong\r\nphilanthropists, political party men, and the men who think England\r\nhumiliated if she ever lets slip an excuse for drawing her sword, drove\r\nthe cabinet on to the rocks. When the decision of the cabinet was (M57)\r\ntaken (Feb. 12, 1883) to send troops to Suakin, Mr. Gladstone stood alone\r\nin objecting. Many thousands of savages were slaughtered under\r\nhumanitarian pressure, not a few English lives were sacrificed, much\r\ntreasure flowed, and yet Sinkat fell, and Tokar fell, and our labours in\r\nthe eastern Soudan were practically fruitless.(85) The operations had no\r\neffect upon the roll of the fierce mahdi wave over the Soudan.\r\n\r\nIn England, excitement of the unsound sort that is independent of\r\nknowledge, consideration, or deliberation; independent of any weighing of\r\nthe actual facts and any forecast of latent possibilities, grew more and\r\nmore vociferous. Ministers quailed. Twice they inquired of their agent in\r\nEgypt(86) whether General Gordon might not be of use, and twice they\r\nreceived an adverse reply, mainly on the ground that the presence in\r\nauthority of a Christian officer was a dubious mode of confronting a\r\nsweeping outbreak of moslem fanaticism, and would inevitably alienate\r\ntribes that were still not caught by the Mahdi.(87) Unhappily a third\r\napplication from London at last prevailed, and Sir E. Baring, supported by\r\nNubar, by Sir Evelyn Wood, by Colonel Watson, who had served with Gordon\r\nand knew him well, all agreed that Gordon would be the best man if he\r\nwould pledge himself to carry out the policy of withdrawing from the\r\nSoudan as quickly as possible. “Whoever goes,” said Sir E. Baring in\r\npregnant words to Lord Granville, will “undertake a service of great\r\ndifficulty and danger.” This was on January 16th. Two days later the die\r\nwas cast. Mr. Gladstone was at Hawarden. Lord Granville submitted the\r\nquestion (Jan. 14, 1884) to him in this form: “If Gordon says he believes\r\nhe could by his personal influence excite the tribes to escort the\r\nKhartoum garrison and inhabitants to Suakin, a little pressure on Baring\r\nmight be advisable. The destruction of these poor people will be a great\r\ndisaster.” Mr. Gladstone telegraphed that to this and other parts of the\r\nsame letter, he agreed. Granville then sent him a copy of the telegram\r\nputting “a little pressure on Baring.” To this Mr. Gladstone replied (Jan.\r\n16) in words that, if they had only been taken to heart, would have made\r\nall the difference:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I can find no fault with your telegram to Baring _re_ Chinese\r\n    Gordon, and the main point that strikes me is this: While his\r\n    opinion on the Soudan may be of great value, must we not be very\r\n    careful in any instruction we give, that he does not shift the\r\n    centre of gravity as to political and military responsibility for\r\n    that country? In brief, if he reports what should be done, he\r\n    should not be the judge _who_ should do it, nor ought he to commit\r\n    us on that point by advice officially given. It would be extremely\r\n    difficult after sending him to reject such advice, and it should\r\n    therefore, I think, be made clear that he is not our agent for the\r\n    purpose of advising on that point.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn January 18, Lord Hartington (then secretary of state for war), Lord\r\nGranville, Lord Northbrook, and Sir Charles Dilke met at the war office in\r\nPall Mall. The summons was sudden. Lord Wolseley brought Gordon and left\r\nhim in the ante-room. After a conversation with the ministers, he came out\r\nand said to Gordon, “Government are determined to evacuate the Soudan, for\r\nthey will not guarantee the future government. Will you go and do it?” “_I\r\nsaid_, ‘Yes.’ _He said_, ‘Go in.’ _I went in and saw them. They said_,\r\n‘Did Wolseley tell you our orders?’ _I said_, ‘Yes.’ _I said_, ‘You will\r\nnot guarantee future government of the Soudan, and you wish me to go up\r\nand evacuate now.’ _They said_, ‘Yes,’ _and it was over, and I left at 8\r\np.m. for Calais_.”(88) This graphic story does not pretend to be a full\r\nversion of all that passed, though it puts the essential point\r\nunmistakably enough. Lord Granville seems to have drawn Gordon’s (M58)\r\nspecial attention to the measures to be taken for the security of the\r\nEgyptian garrisons (plural) still holding positions in the Soudan and to\r\nthe best mode of evacuating the interior.(89) On the other hand, according\r\nto a very authentic account that I have seen, Gordon on this occasion\r\nstated that the danger at Khartoum was exaggerated, and that he would be\r\nable to bring away the garrisons without difficulty.\r\n\r\nThus in that conclave of sober statesmen a tragedy began. The next day one\r\nof the four ministers met another; “We were proud of ourselves\r\nyesterday—are you sure we did not commit a gigantic folly?” The prime\r\nminister had agreed at once on receiving the news of what was done at the\r\nwar office, and telegraphed assent the same night.(90) The whole cabinet\r\nmet four days later, Mr. Gladstone among them, and the decision was\r\napproved. There was hardly a choice, for by that time Gordon was at\r\nBrindisi. Gordon, as Mr. Gladstone said, was a hero of heroes. He was a\r\nsoldier of infinite personal courage and daring; of striking military\r\nenergy, initiative, and resource; a high, pure, and single character,\r\ndwelling much in the region of the unseen. But as all who knew him admit,\r\nand as his own records testify, notwithstanding an under-current of shrewd\r\ncommon-sense, he was the creature, almost the sport, of impulse; his\r\nimpressions and purposes changed with the speed of lightning; anger often\r\nmastered him; he went very often by intuitions and inspirations rather\r\nthan by cool inference from carefully surveyed fact: with many variations\r\nof mood he mixed, as we often see in people less famous, an invincible\r\nfaith in his own rapid prepossessions while they lasted. Everybody now\r\ndiscerns that to despatch a soldier of this temperament on a piece of\r\nbusiness that was not only difficult and dangerous, as Sir E. Baring said,\r\nbut profoundly obscure, and needing vigilant sanity and self-control, was\r\nlittle better than to call in a wizard with his magic. Mr. Gladstone\r\nalways professed perplexity in understanding why the violent end of the\r\ngallant Cavagnari in Afghanistan, stirred the world so little in\r\ncomparison with the fate of Gordon. The answer is that Gordon seized the\r\nimagination of England, and seized it on its higher side. His religion was\r\neccentric, but it was religion; the Bible was the rock on which he founded\r\nhimself, both old dispensation and new; he was known to hate forms,\r\nceremonies, and all the “solemn plausibilities”; his speech was sharp,\r\npithy, rapid, and ironic; above all, he knew the ways of war and would not\r\nbear the sword for nought. All this was material enough to make a popular\r\nideal, and this is what Gordon in an ever-increasing degree became, to the\r\nimmense inconvenience of the statesmen, otherwise so sensible and wary,\r\nwho had now improvidently let the genie forth from the jar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been sometimes contended that all the mischief that followed was\r\ncaused by the diversion of Gordon from Suakin, his original destination.\r\nIf he had gone to the Red Sea, as originally intended, there to report on\r\nthe state and look of things in the Soudan, instead of being waylaid and\r\nbrought to Cairo, and thence despatched to Khartoum, they say, no\r\ncatastrophe would have happened. This is not certain, for the dervishes in\r\nthe eastern Soudan were in the flush of open revolt, and Gordon might\r\neither have been killed or taken prisoner, or else he would have come back\r\nwithout performing any part of his mission. In fact, on his way from\r\nLondon to Port Said, Gordon had suggested that with a view to carrying out\r\nevacuation, the khedive should make him governor-general of the Soudan.\r\nLord Granville authorised Baring to procure the nomination, and this Sir\r\nEvelyn did, “for the time necessary to accomplish the evacuation.” The\r\ninstructions were thus changed, in an important sense, but the change was\r\nsuggested by Gordon and sanctioned by Lord Granville.(91)\r\n\r\n(M59) When Gordon left London his instructions, drafted in fact by\r\nhimself, were that he should “consider and report upon the best mode of\r\neffecting the evacuation of the interior of the Soudan.” He was also to\r\nperform such duties as the Egyptian government might wish to entrust to\r\nhim, and as might be communicated to him by Sir E. Baring.(92) At Cairo,\r\nBaring and Nubar, after discussion with Gordon, altered the mission from\r\none of advice and report to an executive mission—a change that was\r\ndoubtless authorised and covered by the original reference to duties to be\r\nentrusted to him by Egypt. But there was no change in the policy either at\r\nDowning Street or Cairo. Whether advisory or executive, the only policy\r\ncharged upon the mission was abandonment. When the draft of the new\r\ninstructions was read to Gordon at Cairo, Sir E. Baring expressly asked\r\nhim whether he entirely concurred in “the policy of abandoning the\r\nSoudan,” and Gordon not only concurred, but suggested the strengthening\r\nwords, that he thought “it should on no account be changed.”(93) This\r\ndespatch, along with the instructions to Gordon making this vast\r\nalteration, was not received in London until Feb. 7. By this time Gordon\r\nwas crossing the desert, and out of reach of the English foreign office.\r\n\r\nOn his way from Brindisi, Gordon had prepared a memorandum for Sir E.\r\nBaring, in which he set out his opinion that the Soudan had better be\r\nrestored to the different petty sultans in existence before the Egyptian\r\nconquest, and an attempt should be made to form them into some sort of\r\nconfederation. These petty rulers might be left to accept the Mahdi for\r\ntheir sovereign or not, just as they pleased. But in the same document he\r\nemphasised the policy of abandonment. “I understand,” he says, “that\r\nH.M.’s government have come to the irrevocable decision not to incur the\r\nvery onerous duty of granting to the peoples of the Soudan a just future\r\ngovernment.” Left to their independence, the sultans “would doubtless\r\nfight among themselves.” As for future good government, it was evident\r\nthat “this we could not secure them without an inordinate expenditure of\r\nmen and money. The Soudan is a useless possession; ever was so, and ever\r\nwill be so. No one who has ever lived in the Soudan, can escape the\r\nreflection, What a useless possession is this land.” Therefore—so he winds\r\nup—“I think H.M.’s government are fully justified in recommending the\r\nevacuation, inasmuch as the sacrifices necessary towards securing a good\r\ngovernment would be far too onerous to admit of any such attempt being\r\nmade. Indeed, one may say it is impracticable at any cost. _H.M.’s\r\ngovernment will now leave them as God has placed them._”(94)\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, and it is, pure sophistry to contend that Gordon’s\r\npolicy in undertaking his disastrous mission was evacuation but not\r\nabandonment. To say that the Soudanese should be left in the state in\r\nwhich God had placed them, to fight it out among themselves, if they were\r\nso minded, is as good a definition of abandonment as can be invented, and\r\nthis was the whole spirit of the instructions imposed by the government of\r\nthe Queen and accepted by Gordon.\r\n\r\nGordon took with him instruments from the khedive into which, along with\r\ndefinite and specific statements that evacuation was the object of his\r\nmission, two or three loose sentences are slipped about “establishing\r\norganised government in the different provinces of the Soudan,”\r\nmaintaining order, and the like. It is true also that the British cabinet\r\nsanctioned the extension of the area of evacuation from Khartoum to the\r\nwhole Soudan.(95) Strictly construed, the whole body of instructions,\r\nincluding firmans and khedive’s proclamations, is not technically compact\r\nnor coherent. But this is only another way of saying that Gordon was to\r\nhave the widest discretionary powers as to the manner of carrying out the\r\npolicy, and the best time and mode of announcing it. The policy itself, as\r\nwell understood by Gordon as by everybody else, was untouched, and it was:\r\nto leave the Soudanese in the state in which God had placed them.\r\n\r\nThe hot controversy on this point is idle and without substance—the idlest\r\ncontroversies are always the hottest—for (M60) not only was Gordon the\r\nlast man in all the world to hold himself bound by official instructions,\r\nbut the actual conditions of the case were too little known, too shifting,\r\ntoo unstable, to permit of hard and fast directions beforehand how to\r\nsolve so desperate a problem. Two things at any rate were clear—one, that\r\nGordon should faithfully adhere to the policy of evacuation and\r\nabandonment which he had formally accepted; the other, that the British\r\ngovernment should leave him a free hand. Unhappily neither of these two\r\nclear things was accepted by either of the parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nGordon’s policies were many and very mutable. Viewing the frightful\r\nembarrassments that enveloped him, we cannot wonder. Still the same\r\nconsiderateness that is always so bounteously and so justly extended to\r\nthe soldier in the field, is no less due in its measure to the councillor\r\nin the cabinet. This is a bit of equity often much neglected both by\r\ncontemporaries and by history.\r\n\r\nHe had undertaken his mission without any serious and measured forecast,\r\nsuch as his comrade, Colonel Stewart, was well fitted to supply. His first\r\nnotion was that he could restore the representatives of the old rulers,\r\nbut when he got into the country, he found that there were none; with one\r\nby no means happy exception, they had all disappeared. When he reached\r\nBerber, he learned more clearly how the question of evacuation was\r\ninterlaced with other questions. Once at Khartoum, at first he thought\r\nhimself welcome as a deliverer, and then when new light as to the real\r\nfeelings of the Soudanese broke upon him, he flung the policy of his\r\nmission overboard. Before the end of February, instead of the suzerainty\r\nof Egypt, the British government should control Soudanese administration,\r\nwith Zobeir as their governor-general. “When Gordon left this country,”\r\nsaid Mr. Gladstone, “and when he arrived in Egypt, he declared it to be,\r\nand I have not the smallest doubt that it was—a fixed portion of his\r\npolicy, that no British force should be employed in aid of his\r\nmission.”(96) When March came, he flung himself with ardour into the\r\npolicy of “smashing up” the Mahdi, with resort to British and Indian\r\ntroops. This was a violent reversal of all that had been either settled or\r\ndreamed of, whether in London or at Cairo. A still more vehement stride\r\ncame next. He declared that to leave outlying garrisons to their fate\r\nwould be an “indelible disgrace.” Yet, as Lord Hartington said, the\r\ngovernment “were under no moral obligation to use the military resources\r\nof this empire for the relief of those garrisons.” As for Gordon’s opinion\r\nthat “indelible disgrace” would attach to the British government if they\r\nwere not relieved, “I do not admit,” said the minister very sensibly,\r\n“that General Gordon is on this point a better authority than anybody\r\nelse.”(97) All this illustrates the energy of Gordon’s mental movements,\r\nand also, what is more important, the distracting difficulties of the case\r\nbefore him. In one view and one demand he strenuously persevered, as we\r\nshall now see.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone at first, when Gordon set all instructions at defiance, was\r\nfor recalling him. A colleague also was for recalling him on the first\r\ninstant when he changed his policy. Another important member of the\r\ncabinet was, on the contrary, for an expedition. “I cannot admit,” wrote a\r\nfourth leading minister, “that either generals or statesmen who have\r\naccepted the offer of a man to lead a forlorn hope, are in the least bound\r\nto risk the lives of thousands for the uncertain chance of saving the\r\nforlorn hope.” Some think that this was stern common sense, others call it\r\nignoble. The nation, at any rate, was in one of its high idealising\r\nhumours, though Gordon had roused some feeling against himself in this\r\ncountry (unjustly enough) by his decree formally sanctioning the holding\r\nof slaves.\r\n\r\nThe general had not been many hours in Khartoum (February 18) before he\r\nsent a telegram to Sir E. Baring, proposing that on his withdrawal from\r\nKhartoum, Zobeir Pasha should be named his successor as governor-general\r\nof the Soudan: he should be made a K.C.M.G., and have presents given to\r\nhim. This request was strenuously pressed by Gordon. Zobeir had been a\r\nprime actor in the (M61) devastations of the slave trade; it was he who\r\nhad acquired Darfur for Egypt; he was a first-rate fighting man, and the\r\nablest leader in the Soudan. He is described by the English officer who\r\nknows the Soudan best, as a far-seeing, thoughtful man of iron will—a born\r\nruler of men.(98) The Egyptian government had desired to send him down to\r\naid in the operations at Suakin in 1883, but the government in London\r\nvetoed him, as they were now to veto him a second time. The Egyptian\r\ngovernment was to act on its own responsibility, but not to do what it\r\nthought best. So now with Gordon.\r\n\r\nGordon in other days had caused Zobeir’s son to be shot, and this was\r\nsupposed to have set up an unquenchable blood-feud between them. Before\r\nreaching Cairo, he had suggested that Zobeir should be sent to Cyprus, and\r\nthere kept out of the way. This was not done. On Gordon’s way through\r\nCairo, the two men met in what those present describe as a highly dramatic\r\ninterview. Zobeir bitterly upbraided Gordon: “You killed my son, whom I\r\nentrusted to you. He was as your son. You brought my wives and women and\r\nchildren in chains to Khartoum.” Still even after that incident, Gordon\r\ndeclared that he had “a mystical feeling” that Zobeir and he were all\r\nright.(99) What inspired his reiterated demand for the immediate despatch\r\nof Zobeir is surmised to have been the conviction forced upon him during\r\nhis journey to Khartoum, that his first idea of leaving the various petty\r\nsultans to fight it out with the Mahdi, would not work; that the Mahdi had\r\ngot so strong a hold that he could only be met by a man of Zobeir’s\r\npolitical capacity, military skill, and old authority. Sir E. Baring,\r\nafter a brief interval of hesitation, now supported Gordon’s request. So\r\ndid the shrewd and expert Colonel Stewart. Nubar too favoured the idea.\r\nThe cabinet could not at once assent; they were startled by the change of\r\nfront as to total withdrawal from the Soudan—the very object of Gordon’s\r\nmission, and accepted by him as such. On February 21 Mr. Gladstone\r\nreported to the Queen that the cabinet were of opinion that there would be\r\nthe gravest objection to nominating by an assumption of British authority\r\na successor to General Gordon in the Soudan, nor did they as yet see\r\nsufficient reasons for going beyond Gordon’s memorandum of January 25, by\r\nmaking special provision for the government of that country. But at first\r\nit looked as if ministers might yield, if Baring, Gordon, and Nubar\r\npersisted.\r\n\r\nAs ill-fortune had it, the Zobeir plan leaked out at home by Gordon’s\r\nindiscretion before the government decided. The omnipotent though not\r\nomniscient divinity called public opinion intervened. The very men who had\r\nmost loudly clamoured for the extrication of the Egyptian garrisons, who\r\nhad pressed with most importunity for the despatch of Gordon, who had been\r\nmost urgent for the necessity of giving him a free hand, now declared that\r\nit would be a national degradation and a European scandal to listen to\r\nGordon’s very first request. He had himself unluckily given them a capital\r\ntext, having once said that Zobeir was alone responsible for the slave\r\ntrade of the previous ten years. Gordon’s idea was, as he explained, to\r\nput Zobeir into a position like that of the Ameer of Afghanistan, as a\r\nbuffer between Egypt and the Mahdi, with a subsidy, moral support, and all\r\nthe rest of a buffer arrangement. The idea may or may not have been a good\r\none; nobody else had a better.\r\n\r\nIt was not at all surprising that the cabinet should ask what new reason\r\nhad come to light why Zobeir should be trusted; why he should oppose the\r\nMahdi whom at first he was believed to have supported; why he should turn\r\nthe friend of Egypt; why he should be relied upon as the faithful ally of\r\nEngland. To these and other doubts Gordon had excellent answers (March 8).\r\nZobeir would run straight, because it was his interest. If he would be\r\ndangerous, was not the Mahdi dangerous, and whom save Zobeir could you set\r\nup against the Mahdi? You talked of slave-holding and slave-hunting, but\r\nwould slave-holding and slave-hunting (M62) stop with your own policy of\r\nevacuation? Slave-holding you cannot interfere with, and as for\r\nslave-hunting, that depended on the equatorial provinces, where Zobeir\r\ncould be prevented from going, and besides he would have his hands full in\r\nconsolidating his power elsewhere. As for good faith towards Egypt,\r\nZobeir’s stay in Cairo had taught him our power, and being a great trader,\r\nhe would rather seek Egypt’s close alliance. Anyhow, said Gordon, “if you\r\ndo not send Zobeir, you have no chance of getting the garrisons away.”\r\n\r\nThe matter was considered at two meetings of the cabinet, but the prime\r\nminister was prevented by his physician from attending.(100) A difference\r\nof opinion showed itself upon the despatch of Zobeir; viewed as an\r\nabstract question, three of the Commons members inclined to favour it, but\r\non the practical question, the Commons members were unanimous that no\r\ngovernment from either side of the House could venture to sanction Zobeir.\r\nMr. Gladstone had become a strong convert to the plan of sending Zobeir.\r\n“I am better in chest and generally,” he wrote to Lord Granville, “but\r\nunfortunately not in throat and voice, and Clark interdicts my appearance\r\nat cabinet; but I am available for any necessary communication, say with\r\nyou, or you and Hartington.” One of the ministers went to see him in his\r\nbed, and they conversed for two hours. The minister, on his return,\r\nreported with some ironic amusement that Mr. Gladstone considered it very\r\nlikely that they could not bring parliament to swallow Zobeir, but\r\nbelieved that he himself could. Whether his confidence in this was right\r\nor wrong, he was unable to turn his cabinet. The Queen telegraphed her\r\nagreement with the prime minister. But this made no difference. “On\r\nSaturday 15,” Mr. Gladstone notes, “it seemed as if by my casting vote\r\nZobier was to be sent to Gordon. But on Sunday —— and —— receded from\r\ntheir ground, and I gave way. The nature of the evidence on which\r\njudgments are formed in this most strange of all cases, precludes (in\r\nreason) pressing all conclusions, which are but preferences, to extremes.”\r\n“It is well known,” said Mr. Gladstone in the following year when the\r\ncurtain had fallen on the catastrophe, “that if, when the recommendation\r\nto send Zobeir was made, we had complied with it, an address from this\r\nHouse to the crown would have paralysed our action; and though it was\r\nperfectly true that the decision arrived at was the judgment of the\r\ncabinet, it was also no less the judgment of parliament and the people.”\r\nSo Gordon’s request was refused.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, as a minister put it at the time, to send Zobeir would\r\nhave been a gambler’s throw. But then what was it but a gambler’s throw to\r\nsend Gordon himself? The Soudanese chieftain might possibly have done all\r\nthat Gordon and Stewart, who knew the ground and were watching the quick\r\nfluctuation of events with elastic minds, now positively declared that he\r\nwould have the strongest motives not to do. Even then, could the issue\r\nhave been worse? To run all the risks involved in the despatch of Gordon,\r\nand then immediately to refuse the request that he persistently\r\nrepresented as furnishing him his only chance, was an incoherence that the\r\nparliament and people of England have not often surpassed.(101) All\r\nthrough this critical month, from the 10th until the 30th, Mr. Gladstone\r\nwas suffering more or less from indisposition which he found it difficult\r\nto throw off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chance, whatever it may have been, passed like a flash. Just as the\r\nproposal inflamed many in England, so it did mischief in Cairo. Zobeir\r\nlike other people got wind of it; enemies of England at Cairo set to work\r\nwith him; Sir E. Baring might have found him hard to deal with. It was\r\nGordon’s rashness that had made the design public. Gordon, too, as it\r\nhappened, had made a dire mistake on his way up. At Berber he had shown\r\nthe khedive’s secret firman, (M63) announcing the intended abandonment of\r\nthe Soudan. The news spread; it soon reached the Mahdi himself, and the\r\nMahdi made politic use of it. He issued a proclamation of his own, asking\r\nall the sheikhs who stood aloof from him or against him, what they had to\r\ngain by supporting a pasha who was the next day going to give the Soudan\r\nup. Gordon’s argument for this unhappy proceeding was that, the object of\r\nhis mission being to get out of the country and leave them to their\r\nindependence, he could have put no sharper spur into them to make them\r\norganise their own government. But he spoke of it after as the fatal\r\nproclamation, and so it was.(102)\r\n\r\nWhat happened was that the tribes round Khartoum almost at once began to\r\nwaver. From the middle of March, says a good observer, one searches in\r\nvain for a single circumstance hopeful for Gordon. “When the eye wanders\r\nover the huge and hostile Soudan, notes the little pin-point garrisons,\r\neach smothered in a cloud of Arab spears, and remembers that Gordon and\r\nStewart proceeded to rule this vast empire, already given away to others,\r\none feels that the Soudanese view was marked by common sense.”(103)\r\nGordon’s too sanguine prediction that the men who had beaten Hicks, and\r\nthe men who afterwards beat Baker, would never fight beyond their tribal\r\nlimits, did not come true. Wild forces gathered round the Mahdi as he\r\nadvanced northwards. The tribes that had wavered joined them. Berber fell\r\non May 26. The pacific mission had failed, and Gordon and his comrade\r\nStewart—a more careful and clear-sighted man than himself—were shut up in\r\nKhartoum.\r\n\r\nDistractions grew thicker upon the cabinet, and a just reader, now far\r\naway from the region of votes of censure, will bear them in mind. The\r\nQueen, like many of her subjects, grew impatient, but Mr. Gladstone was\r\njustified in reminding her of the imperfect knowledge, and he might have\r\ncalled it blank ignorance, with which the government was required on the\r\nshortest notice to form conclusions on a remote and more than\r\nhalf-barbarous region.\r\n\r\nGordon had told them that he wanted to take his steam vessels to Equatoria\r\nand serve the king of the Belgians. This Sir Evelyn Baring refused to\r\nallow, not believing Gordon to be in immediate danger (March 26). From\r\nGordon himself came a telegram (March 28), “I think we are now safe, and\r\nthat, as the Nile rises, we shall account for the rebels.” Mr. Gladstone\r\nwas still unwell and absent. Through Lord Granville he told the cabinet\r\n(March 15) that, with a view to speedy departure from Khartoum, he would\r\nnot even refuse absolutely to send cavalry to Berber, much as he disliked\r\nit, provided the military authorities thought it could be done, and\r\nprovided also that it was declared necessary for Gordon’s safety, and was\r\nstrictly confined to that object. The cabinet decided against an immediate\r\nexpedition, one important member vowing that he would resign if an\r\nexpedition were not sent in the autumn, another vowing that he would\r\nresign if it were. On April 7, the question of an autumn expedition again\r\ncame up. Six were favourable, five the other way, including the prime\r\nminister.\r\n\r\nAlmost by the end of March it was too probable that no road of retreat was\r\nany longer open. If they could cut no way out, either by land or water,\r\nwhat form of relief was possible? A diversion from Suakin to Berber—one of\r\nGordon’s own suggestions? But the soldiers differed. Fierce summer heat\r\nand little water; an Indian force might stand it; even they would find it\r\ntough. A dash by a thousand cavalry across two hundred miles of desert—one\r\nhundred of them without water; without communication with its base, and\r\nwith the certainty that whatever might befall, no reinforcements could\r\nreach it for months? What would be your feelings, and your language, asked\r\nLord (M64) Hartington, if besides having Gordon and Stewart beleaguered in\r\nKhartoum, we also knew that a small force of British cavalry unable to\r\ntake the offensive was shut up in the town of Berber?(104) Then the\r\ngovernment wondered whether a move on Dongola might not be advantageous.\r\nHere again the soldiers thought the torrid climate a fatal objection, and\r\nthe benefits doubtful. Could not Gordon, some have asked, have made his\r\nretreat at an early date after reaching Khartoum, by way of Berber?\r\nAnswer—the Nile was too low. All this it was that at a later day, when the\r\ntime had come to call his government to its account, justified Mr.\r\nGladstone in saying that in such enterprises as these in the Soudan,\r\nmistakes and miscarriages were inevitable, for they were the proper and\r\ncertain consequences of undertakings that lie beyond the scope of human\r\nmeans and of rational and prudent human action, and are a war against\r\nnature.(105) If anybody now points to the victorious expedition to\r\nKhartoum thirteen years later, as falsifying such language as this, that\r\nexperience so far from falsifying entirely justifies. A war against nature\r\ndemands years of study, observation, preparation, and those who are best\r\nacquainted with the conditions at first hand all agree that neither the\r\ntribes nor the river nor the desert were well known enough in 1885, to\r\nguarantee that overthrow in the case of the Mahdi, which long afterwards\r\ndestroyed his successor.\r\n\r\nOn April 14 Sir E. Baring, while as keenly averse as anybody in the world\r\nto an expedition for the relief of Khartoum if such an expedition could be\r\navoided, still watching events with a clear and concentrated gaze, assured\r\nthe government that it was very likely to be unavoidable; it would be well\r\ntherefore, without loss of time, to prepare for a move as soon as ever the\r\nNile should rise. Six days before, Lord Wolseley also had written to Lord\r\nHartington at the war office, recommending immediate and active\r\npreparations for an exclusively British expedition to Khartoum. Time, he\r\nsaid, is the most important element in this question; and in truth it was,\r\nfor time was flying, and so were events. The cabinet were reported as\r\nfeeling that Gordon, “who was despatched on a mission essentially pacific,\r\nhad found himself, from whatever cause, unable to prosecute it\r\neffectually, and now proposed the use of military means, which might fail,\r\nand which, even if they should succeed, might be found to mean a new\r\nsubjugation of the Soudan—the very consummation which it was the object of\r\nGordon’s mission to avert.” On June 27 it was known in London that Berber\r\nhad fallen a month before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Hartington, as head of the war department, had a stronger leaning\r\ntowards the despatch of troops than some of his colleagues, but, says Mr.\r\nGladstone to Lord Granville in a letter of 1888, “I don’t think he ever\r\ncame to any sharp issue (like mine about Zobeir); rather that in the main\r\nhe got what he wanted.” Wherever the fault lay, the issue was unfortunate.\r\nThe generals in London fought the battle of the routes with unabated\r\ntenacity for month after month. One was for the approach to Khartoum by\r\nthe Nile; another by Suakin and Berber; a third by the Korosko desert. A\r\ndepartmental committee reported in favour of the Nile as the easiest,\r\nsafest, and cheapest, but they did not report until July 29. It was not\r\nuntil the beginning of August that the House of Commons was asked for a\r\nvote of credit, and Lord Hartington authorised General Stephenson at Cairo\r\nto take measures for moving troops southward. In his despatch of August 8,\r\nLord Hartington still only speaks of operations for the relief of Gordon,\r\n“should they become necessary”; he says the government were still\r\nunconvinced that Gordon could not secure the withdrawal of the garrison\r\nfrom Khartoum; but “they are of opinion that the time had arrived for\r\nobtaining accurate information as to his position,” and, “if necessary,\r\nfor rendering him assistance.”(106) As soon as the decision was taken,\r\npreparations were carried out with rapidity and skill. In the same month\r\nLord Wolseley was (M65) appointed to command the expedition, and on\r\nSeptember 9 he reached Cairo. The difficulties of a military decision had\r\nbeen great, said Lord Hartington, and there was besides, he added, a\r\ndifference of opinion among the military authorities.(107) It was October\r\n5 before Lord Wolseley reached Wady-Halfa, and the Nile campaign began.\r\n\r\nWhatever decision military critics may ultimately form upon the choice of\r\nthe Nile route, or upon the question whether the enterprise would have\r\nbeen any more successful if the route had been by Suakin or Korosko, it is\r\nat least certain that no position, whether strategically false or no, has\r\never evoked more splendid qualities in face of almost preterhuman\r\ndifficulties, hardship, and labour. The treacherous and unknown river, for\r\nit was then unknown, with its rapids, its shifting sandbanks and tortuous\r\nchannels and rocky barriers and heart-breaking cataracts; the Bayuda\r\ndesert, haunted by fierce and stealthy enemies; the trying climate, the\r\nheat, the thirst, all the wearisome embarrassments of transport on camels\r\nemaciated by lack of food and water—such scenes exacted toil, patience,\r\nand courage as worthy of remark and admiration as if the advance had\r\nsuccessfully achieved its object. Nobody lost heart. “Everything goes on\r\nswimmingly,” wrote Sir Herbert Stewart to Lord Wolseley, “_except as to\r\ntime_.” This was on January 14, 1885. Five days later, he was mortally\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nThe end of it all, in spite of the gallantry of Abu Klea and Kirbekan, of\r\ndesert column and river column, is only too well known. Four of Gordon’s\r\nsmall steamers coming down from Khartoum met the British desert column at\r\nGubat on January 21. The general in command at once determined to proceed\r\nto Khartoum, but delayed his start until the morning of the 24th. The\r\nsteamers needed repairs, and Sir Charles Wilson deemed it necessary for\r\nthe safety of his troops to make a reconnaissance down the river towards\r\nBerber before starting up to Khartoum. He took with him on two of Gordon’s\r\nsteamers—described as of the dimensions of the penny boats upon the\r\nThames, but bullet proof—a force of twenty-six British, and two hundred\r\nand forty Soudanese. He had also in tow a nugger laden with dhura. This\r\nwas what, when Khartoum came in sight (Jan. 28) the “relief force”\r\nactually amounted to. As the two steamers ran slowly on, a solitary voice\r\nfrom the river-bank now and again called out to them that Khartoum was\r\ntaken, and Gordon slain. Eagerly searching with their glasses, the\r\nofficers perceived that the government-house was a wreck, and that no flag\r\nwas flying. Gordon, in fact, had met his death two days before.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone afterwards always spoke of the betrayal of Khartoum. But\r\nMajor Kitchener, who prepared the official report, says that the\r\naccusations of treachery were all vague, and to his mind, the outcome of\r\nmere supposition. “In my opinion,” he says, “Khartoum fell from sudden\r\nassault, when the garrison were too exhausted by privations to make proper\r\nresistance.”(108) The idea that the relieving force was only two days late\r\nis misleading. A nugger’s load of dhura would not have put an end to the\r\nprivations of the fourteen thousand people still in Khartoum; and even\r\nsupposing that the handful of troops at Gubat could have effected their\r\nadvance upon Khartoum many days earlier, it is hard to believe that they\r\nwere strong enough either to drive off the Mahdi, or to hold him at bay\r\nuntil the river column had come up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prime minister was on a visit to the Duke of Devonshire at Holker,\r\nwhere he had many long conversations with Lord Hartington, and had to deal\r\nwith heavy post-bags. On Thursday, Feb. 5, after writing to the Queen and\r\nothers, he heard what had happened on the Nile ten days before. “After 11\r\nA.M.,” he records, “I learned the sad news of the fall or betrayal of\r\nKhartoum. H[artington] and I, with C [his wife], went off by the first\r\ntrain, and reached Downing Street soon after 8.15. The circumstances are\r\nsad and trying. It is one of the least points about them that they may put\r\nan end to this government.”(109) The next day the cabinet met; (M66)\r\ndiscussions “difficult but harmonious.” The Queen sent to him and to Lord\r\nHartington at Holker an angry telegram—blaming her ministers for what had\r\nhappened—a telegram not in cipher as usual, but open. Mr. Gladstone\r\naddressed to the Queen in reply (Feb. 5, 1885) a vindication of the course\r\ntaken by the cabinet; and it may be left to close an unedifying and a\r\ntragic chapter:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To the Queen._\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gladstone has had the honour this day to receive your\r\n    Majesty’s telegram _en clair_, relating to the deplorable\r\n    intelligence received this day from Lord Wolseley, and stating\r\n    that it is too fearful to consider that the fall of Khartoum might\r\n    have been, prevented and many precious lives saved by earlier\r\n    action. Mr. Gladstone does not presume to estimate the means of\r\n    judgment possessed by your Majesty, but so far as his information\r\n    and recollection at the moment go, he is not altogether able to\r\n    follow the conclusion which your Majesty has been pleased thus to\r\n    announce. Mr. Gladstone is under the impression that Lord\r\n    Wolseley’s force might have been sufficiently advanced to save\r\n    Khartoum, had not a large portion of it been detached by a\r\n    circuitous route along the river, upon the express application of\r\n    General Gordon, to occupy Berber on the way to the final\r\n    destination. He speaks, however, with submission on a point of\r\n    this kind. There is indeed in some quarters a belief that the\r\n    river route ought to have been chosen at an earlier period, and\r\n    had the navigation of the Nile in its upper region been as well\r\n    known as that of the Thames, this might have been a just ground of\r\n    reproach. But when, on the first symptoms that the position of\r\n    General Gordon in Khartoum was not secure, your Majesty’s advisers\r\n    at once sought from the most competent persons the best\r\n    information they could obtain respecting the Nile route, the\r\n    balance of testimony and authority was decidedly against it, and\r\n    the idea of the Suakin and Berber route, with all its formidable\r\n    difficulties, was entertained in preference; nor was it until a\r\n    much later period that the weight of opinion and information\r\n    warranted the definitive choice of the Nile route. Your Majesty’s\r\n    ministers were well aware that climate and distance were far more\r\n    formidable than the sword of the enemy, and they deemed it right,\r\n    while providing adequate military means, never to lose from view\r\n    what might have proved to be the destruction of the gallant army\r\n    in the Soudan. It is probable that abundant wrath and indignation\r\n    will on this occasion be poured out upon them. Nor will they\r\n    complain if so it should be; but a partial consolation may be\r\n    found on reflecting that neither aggressive policy, nor military\r\n    disaster, nor any gross error in the application of means to ends,\r\n    has marked this series of difficult proceedings, which, indeed,\r\n    have greatly redounded to the honour of your Majesty’s forces of\r\n    all ranks and arms. In these remarks which Mr. Gladstone submits\r\n    with his humble devotion, he has taken it for granted that\r\n    Khartoum has fallen through the exhaustion of its means of\r\n    defence. But your Majesty may observe from the telegram that this\r\n    is uncertain. Both the correspondent’s account and that of Major\r\n    Wortley refer to the delivery of the town by treachery, a\r\n    contingency which on some previous occasions General Gordon has\r\n    treated as far from improbable; and which, if the notice existed,\r\n    was likely to operate quite independently of the particular time\r\n    at which a relieving force might arrive. The presence of the enemy\r\n    in force would naturally suggest the occasion, or perhaps even the\r\n    apprehension of the approach of the British army. In pointing to\r\n    these considerations, Mr. Gladstone is far from assuming that they\r\n    are conclusive upon the whole case; in dealing with which the\r\n    government has hardly ever at any of its stages been furnished\r\n    sufficiently with those means of judgment which rational men\r\n    usually require. It may be that, on a retrospect, many errors will\r\n    appear to have been committed. There are many reproaches, from the\r\n    most opposite quarters, to which it might be difficult to supply a\r\n    conclusive answer. Among them, and perhaps among the most\r\n    difficult, as far as Mr. Gladstone can judge, would be the\r\n    reproach of those who might argue that our proper business was the\r\n    protection of Egypt, that it never was in military danger from the\r\n    Mahdi, and that the most prudent course would have been to provide\r\n    it with adequate frontier defences, and to assume no\r\n    responsibility for the lands beyond the desert.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne word more. Writing to one of his former colleagues long after Mr.\r\nGladstone says:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 10, ’90._—In the Gordon case we all, and I rather\r\n    prominently, must continue to suffer in silence. Gordon was a\r\n    hero, and a hero of heroes; but we ought to have known that a hero\r\n    of heroes is not the proper person to give effect at a distant\r\n    point, and in most difficult circumstances, to the views of\r\n    ordinary men. It was unfortunate that he should claim the hero’s\r\n    privilege by turning upside down and inside out every idea and\r\n    intention with which he had left England, and for which he had\r\n    obtained our approval. Had my views about Zobeir prevailed, it\r\n    would not have removed our difficulties, as Forster would\r\n    certainly have moved, and with the tories and the Irish have\r\n    carried, a condemnatory address. My own opinion is that it is\r\n    harder to justify our doing so much to rescue him, than our not\r\n    doing more. Had the party reached Khartoum in time, he would not\r\n    have come away (as I suppose), and the dilemma would have arisen\r\n    in another form.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1890 an application was made to Mr. Gladstone by a certain foreign\r\nwriter who had undertaken an article on Gordon and his mission. Mr.\r\nGladstone’s reply (Jan. 11, ’90) runs to this effect:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am much obliged by your kind letter and enclosure. I hope you\r\n    will not think it belies this expression when I say that I feel\r\n    myself precluded from supplying any material or entering upon any\r\n    communications for the purpose of self-defence against the charges\r\n    which are freely made and I believe widely accepted against myself\r\n    and against the cabinet of 1880-5 in connection with General\r\n    Gordon. It would be felt in this country, by friends I think in\r\n    many cases as well as adversaries, that General Gordon’s\r\n    much-lamented death ought to secure him, so far as we are\r\n    concerned, against the counter-argument which we should have to\r\n    present on his language and proceedings. On this account you will,\r\n    I hope, excuse me from entering into the matter. I do not doubt\r\n    that a true and equitable judgment will eventually prevail.(110)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X. Interior Of The Cabinet. (1895)\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am aware that the age is not what we all wish, but I am sure\r\n    that the only means to check its degeneracy is heartily to concur\r\n    in whatever is best in our time.—BURKE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1885 must be counted as in some respects the severest epoch of\r\nMr. Gladstone’s life. The previous twelve months had not ended cheerfully.\r\nSleep, the indispensable restorer, and usually his constant friend, was\r\nplaying him false. The last entry in his diary was this:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The year closed with a bad night, only one hour and a half of\r\n    sleep, which will hardly do to work upon. There is much that I\r\n    should like to have recorded.... But the pressure on me is too\r\n    great for the requisite recollection. It is indeed a time of\r\n    _Sturm und Drang_. What with the confusion of affairs, and the\r\n    disturbance of my daily life by the altered character of my\r\n    nights, I cannot think in calm, but can only trust and pray.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was unable to be present at the dinner of the tenants, and his eldest\r\nson in his absence dwelt once more on his father’s wish to retire,\r\nwhenever occasion should come, from the public service, or at least from\r\nthat kind of service to the public which imposed on him such arduous\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\nOne great element of confusion was the sphinx’s riddle of Egyptian\r\nfinance. On his birthday, among a dozen occupations, he says: “A little\r\nwoodcraft for helping sleep; wrote mem. on Egyptian finance which I hope\r\nmay help to clear my brain and nerves.” And this was a characteristic way\r\nof seeking a cure; for now and at every time, any task that demanded close\r\nthought and firm expression was his surest (M67) sedative. More perplexing\r\neven than the successive problems of the hour, was the threatened\r\ndisorganisation, not only of his cabinet, but of the party and its future.\r\nOn January 20 he was forced to London for two Egyptian cabinets, but he\r\nspeedily returned to Hawarden, whence he immediately wrote a letter to\r\nLord Granville:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _January 22, 1885._—Here I am after a journey of 5-½ hours from\r\n    door to door, through the unsought and ill-deserved kindness of\r\n    the London and North-Western railway, which entirely spoils me by\r\n    special service.\r\n\r\n    There was one part of my conversation of to-day with Hartington\r\n    which I should like not to leave in any case without record. He\r\n    referred to the difficulties he had had, and he “gratefully”\r\n    acknowledged the considerateness of the cabinet. He said the point\r\n    always urged upon him was, not to break up the liberal party. But,\r\n    he said, can we avoid its breaking up, within a very short time\r\n    after you retire, and ought this consideration therefore to be\r\n    regarded as of such very great force? I said, my reply is in two\r\n    sentences. First, I admit that from various symptoms it is not\r\n    improbable there may be a plan or intention to break up the party.\r\n    But if a rupture of that kind comes,—this is my second sentence—it\r\n    will come upon matters of principle, known and understood by the\r\n    whole country, and your duty will probably be clear and your\r\n    position unembarrassed. But I entreat you to use your utmost\r\n    endeavour to avoid bringing about the rupture on one of the points\r\n    of this Egyptian question, which lies outside the proper business\r\n    of a government and is beyond its powers, which does not turn upon\r\n    clear principles of politics, and about which the country\r\n    understands almost nothing, and cares, for the most part, very\r\n    little. All this he took without rejoinder.\r\n\r\n    _P.S._—We are going to Holker next week, and Hartington said he\r\n    would try to come and see me there.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen,(111) Mr. Gladstone paid his visit to Holker\r\n(January 30), where he found the Duke of Devonshire “wonderfully well, and\r\nkind as ever,” where he was joined by Lord Hartington, and where they\r\ntogether spelled out the cipher telegram (on February 5) bringing the evil\r\nnews of the fall of Khartoum.\r\n\r\nIt is not uninteresting to see how the notion of Mr. Gladstone’s\r\nretirement, now much talked of in his family, affected a friendly,\r\nphilosophic, and most observant onlooker. Lord Acton wrote to him\r\n(February 2):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    You mean that the new parliament, the first of our democratic\r\n    constitution, shall begin its difficult and perilous course\r\n    without the services of a leader who has greater experience and\r\n    authority than any other man. You design to withdraw your\r\n    assistance when most urgently needed, at the moment of most\r\n    conservative apprehension and most popular excitement. By the\r\n    choice of this particular moment for retirement you increase the\r\n    danger of the critical transition, because nobody stands as you do\r\n    between the old order of things and the new, or inspires general\r\n    confidence; and the lieutenants of Alexander are not at their\r\n    best. Next year’s change will appear vast and formidable to the\r\n    suspicious foreigner, who will be tempted to doubt our identity.\r\n    It is in the national interest to reduce the outer signs of\r\n    change, to bridge the apparent chasm, to maintain the traditional\r\n    character of the state. The unavoidable elements of weakness will\r\n    be largely and voluntarily aggravated by their untimely\r\n    coincidence with an event which must, at any time, be a blow to\r\n    the position of England among the Powers. Your absence just then\r\n    must grievously diminish our credit.... You alone inspire\r\n    confidence that what is done for the great masses shall be done\r\n    with a full sense of economic responsibility.... A divided liberal\r\n    party and a weak conservative party mean the supremacy of the\r\n    revolutionary Irish....\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. Gladstone replied:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _10 Downing Street, Feb. 11, 1885._ Your argument against letting\r\n    the outworn hack go to grass, depends wholly on a certain\r\n    proposition, namely this, that there is about to be a crisis in\r\n    the history of the constitution, growing out of the extension of\r\n    the franchise, and that it is my duty to do what I can in aiding\r\n    to steer the ship through the boiling waters of this crisis. My\r\n    answer is simple. There is no crisis at all in view. There is a\r\n    process of slow modification and development mainly in directions\r\n    which I view with misgiving. “Tory democracy,” the favourite idea\r\n    on that side, is no more like the conservative party in which I\r\n    was bred, than it is like liberalism. In fact less. It is\r\n    demagogism, only a demagogism not ennobled by love and\r\n    appreciation of liberty, but applied in the worst way, to put down\r\n    the pacific, law-respecting, economic elements which ennobled the\r\n    old conservatism, living upon the fomentation of angry passions,\r\n    and still in secret as obstinately attached as ever to the evil\r\n    principle of class interests. The liberalism of to-day is better\r\n    in what I have described as ennobling the old conservatism; nay,\r\n    much better, yet far from being good. Its pet idea is what they\r\n    call construction,—that is to say, taking into the hands of the\r\n    state the business of the individual man. Both the one and the\r\n    other have much to estrange me, and have had for many, many years.\r\n    But, with all this, there is no crisis. I have even the hope that\r\n    while the coming change may give undue encouragement to\r\n    “construction,” it will be favourable to the economic, pacific,\r\n    law-regarding elements; and the sense of justice which abides\r\n    tenaciously in the masses will never knowingly join hands with the\r\n    fiend of Jingoism. On the whole, I do not abandon the hope that it\r\n    may mitigate the chronic distemper, and have not the smallest fear\r\n    of its bringing about an acute or convulsive action. You leave me\r\n    therefore rooted in my evil mind....\r\n\r\n\r\nThe activity of the left wing, acute, perhaps, but not convulsive, became\r\nmuch more embarrassing than the desire of the right wing to be inactive.\r\nMr. Chamberlain had been rapidly advancing in public prominence, and he\r\nnow showed that the agitation against the House of Lords was to be only\r\nthe beginning and not the end. At Ipswich (January 14), he said this\r\ncountry had been called the paradise of the rich, and warned his audience\r\nno longer to allow it to remain the purgatory of the poor. He told them\r\nthat reform of local government must be almost the first reform of the\r\nnext parliament, and spoke in favour of allotments, the creation of small\r\nproprietors, the placing of a small tax on the total property of the\r\ntaxpayer, and of free education. Mr. Gladstone’s attention was drawn from\r\nWindsor to these utterances, and he replied (January 22) that though he\r\nthought some of them were “on various grounds open to grave objection,”\r\nyet they seemed to raise no “definite point on which, in his capacity of\r\nprime minister, he was entitled to interfere and lecture the speaker.” A\r\nfew days later, more terrible things were said by Mr. Chamberlain at\r\nBirmingham. He pronounced for the abolition of plural voting, and in\r\nfavour of payment of members, and manhood suffrage. He also advocated a\r\nbill for enabling local communities to acquire land, a graduated\r\nincome-tax, and the breaking up of the great estates as the first step in\r\nland reform. This deliverance was described by not unfriendly critics as\r\n“a little too much the speech of the agitator of the future, rather than\r\nof the minister of the present.” Mr. Gladstone made a lenient\r\ncommunication to the orator, to the effect that “there had better be some\r\nexplanations among them when they met.” To Lord Granville he wrote\r\n(January 31):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Upon the whole, weak-kneed liberals have caused us more trouble in\r\n    the present parliament than radicals. But I think these\r\n    declarations by Chamberlain upon matters which cannot, humanly\r\n    speaking, become practical before the next parliament, can hardly\r\n    be construed otherwise than as having a remote and (in that sense)\r\n    far-sighted purpose which is ominous enough. The opposition can\r\n    hardly fail in their opportunity, I must add in their duty, to\r\n    make them matter of attack. Such things will happen casually from\r\n    time to time, and always with inconvenience—but there is here a\r\n    degree of method and system which seem to give the matter a new\r\n    character.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from his tone that Mr. Gladstone, in all the\r\nembarrassments arising from this source, showed complete freedom from\r\npersonal irritation. Like the lofty-minded man he was, he imputed no low\r\nmotives to a colleague because the colleague gave him trouble. He\r\nrecognised by now that in his cabinet the battle was being fought between\r\nold time and new. He did not allow his dislike of some of the new methods\r\nof forming public opinion, to prevent him from doing full justice to the\r\nenergetic and sincere public spirit behind them. He had, moreover, quite\r\nenough to do with (M68) the demands of the present, apart from signs that\r\nwere ominous for the future. A year before, in a letter to Lord Granville\r\n(March 24, 1884), he had attempted a definition that will, perhaps, be of\r\ngeneral interest to politicians of either party complexion. It is, at any\r\nrate, characteristic of his subtlety, if that be the right word, in\r\ndrawing distinctions:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    What are divisions in a cabinet? In my opinion, differences of\r\n    views stated, and if need be argued, and then advisedly\r\n    surrendered with a view to a common conclusion are not “divisions\r\n    in a cabinet.” By that phrase I understand unaccommodated\r\n    differences on matters standing for immediate action.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was unaccommodated differences of this kind that cost Mr. Disraeli\r\nsecessions on the Reform bill, and secessions no less serious on his\r\neastern policy, and it is one of the wonders of his history that Mr.\r\nGladstone prevented secession on the matters now standing for immediate\r\naction before his own cabinet. During the four months between the meeting\r\nof parliament and the fall of the government, the two great difficulties\r\nof the government—Egypt and Ireland—reached their climax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news of the fall of Khartoum reached England on February 5. One of the\r\nleast points, as Mr. Gladstone wrote on the day, was that the grievous\r\nnews would put an end to the government, and so it very nearly did. As was\r\nto be expected, Sir Stafford Northcote moved a vote of censure. Mr.\r\nGladstone informed the Queen, on the day before the division, that the\r\naspect of the House was “dubious and equivocal.” If there was a chance of\r\noverthrowing the ministry, he said, the nationalists were pretty sure to\r\nact and vote as a body with Sir Stafford. Mr. Forster, Mr. Goschen, and\r\nsome members of the whig section of the liberal party, were likely either\r\nto do the same, or else to abstain. These circumstances looked towards an\r\nunfavourable issue, if not in the shape of an adverse majority, yet in the\r\nform of a majority too small to enable the government to carry on with\r\nadequate authority and efficiency. In the debate, said Mr. Gladstone, Lord\r\nHartington re-stated with measured force the position of the government,\r\nand overthrew the contention that had taken a very forward place in the\r\nindictment against ministers, that their great offence was the failure to\r\nsend forward General Graham’s force to relieve General Gordon. In the\r\ncourse of this debate Mr. Goschen warned the government that if they\r\nflinched from the policy of smashing the Mahdi at Khartoum, he should vote\r\nagainst them. A radical below the gangway upon this went to the party whip\r\nand declared, with equal resolution, that if the government insisted on\r\nthe policy, then it would be for him and others to vote against them. Sir\r\nWilliam Harcourt, in a speech of great power, satisfied the gentlemen\r\nbelow the gangway, and only a small handful of the party went into the\r\nlobby with the opposition and the Irish. The division was taken at four in\r\nthe morning (February 28), and the result was that the government which\r\nhad come in with morning radiance five years ago, was worn down to an\r\nattenuated majority of fourteen.(112)\r\n\r\nWhen the numbers were declared, Mr. Gladstone said to a colleague on the\r\nbench, “_That will do._” Whether this delphic utterance meant that the\r\nsize of the majority would justify resignation or retention, the colleague\r\nwas not sure. When the cabinet met at a more mellowed hour in the day, the\r\nquestion between going out of office and staying in, was fully discussed.\r\nMere considerations of ease all pointed one way, for, if they held on,\r\nthey would seem to be dependent on tory support; trouble was brewing with\r\nRussia, and the Seats bill would not be through in a hurry. On the other\r\nhand, fourteen was majority enough to swear by, the party would be\r\nsurprised by resignation and discouraged, and retirement would wear the\r\nlook of a false position. In fact Mr. Gladstone, in spite of his incessant\r\nsighs for a hermit’s calm, was always for fighting out every position to\r\nthe last trench. I can think of no exception, and even when the time came\r\nten years later, he thought his successors pusillanimous for (M69)\r\nretiring on a small scratch defeat on cordite.(113) So now he acted on the\r\nprinciple that with courage cabinets may weather almost any storm. No\r\nactual vote was taken, but the numbers for and against retirement were\r\nequal, until Mr. Gladstone spoke. He thought that they should try to go\r\non, at least until the Seats bill was through. This was the final\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nAll this brought once more into his mind the general consideration that\r\nnow naturally much haunted him. He wrote to the Queen (February 27):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gladstone believes that circumstances independent of his own\r\n    will enable him to estimate, with some impartiality, future\r\n    political changes, and he is certainly under the impression that,\r\n    partly from the present composition and temper of the liberal\r\n    party, and still more, and even much more, from the changes which\r\n    the conservative party has been undergoing during the last forty\r\n    years (especially the last ten or fifteen of them), the next\r\n    change of government may possibly form the introduction to a\r\n    period presenting some new features, and may mean more than what\r\n    is usually implied in the transfer of power from one party to\r\n    another.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Bright has left a note of a meeting with him at this time:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _March 2, 1885._—Dined with Mrs. Gladstone. After dinner, sat for\r\n    half an hour or more with Mr. Gladstone, who is ill with cold and\r\n    hoarseness. Long talk on Egypt. He said he had suffered torment\r\n    during the continuance of the difficulty in that country. The\r\n    sending Gordon out a great mistake,—a man totally unsuited for the\r\n    work he undertook. Mr. Gladstone never saw Gordon. He was\r\n    appointed by ministers in town, and Gladstone concurred, but had\r\n    never seen him.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this moment clouds began to darken the remote horizon on the north-west\r\nboundary of our great Indian possessions. The entanglement in the deserts\r\nof the Soudan was an obvious temptation to any other Power with policies\r\nof its own, to disregard the susceptibilities or even the solid interests\r\nof Great Britain. As we shall see, Mr. Gladstone was as little disposed as\r\nChatham or Palmerston to shrink from the defence of the legitimate rights\r\nor obligations of his country. But the action of Russia in Afghanistan\r\nbecame an added and rather poignant anxiety.\r\n\r\nAs early as March 12 the cabinet found it necessary to consider the\r\nmenacing look of things on the Afghan frontier. Military necessities in\r\nIndia, as Mr. Gladstone described to the Queen what was in the mind of her\r\nministers, “might conceivably at this juncture come to overrule the\r\npresent intentions as to the Soudan as part of them, and it would\r\nconsequently be imprudent to do anything which could practically extend\r\nour obligations in that quarter; as it is the entanglement of the British\r\nforces in Soudanese operations, which would most powerfully tempt Russia\r\nto adopt aggressive measures.” Three or four weeks later these\r\nconsiderations came to a head. The question put by Mr. Gladstone to his\r\ncolleagues was this: “Apart from the defence of Egypt, which no one would\r\npropose to abandon, does there appear to be any obligation of honour or\r\nany inducement of policy (for myself I should add, is there any moral\r\nwarrant?) that should lead us in the present state of the demands on the\r\nempire, to waste a large portion of our army in fighting against nature,\r\nand I fear also fighting against liberty (such liberty as the case admits)\r\nin the Soudan?” The assumptions on which the policy had been founded had\r\nall broken down. Osman Digna, instead of being readily crushed, had\r\nbetaken himself to the mountains and could not be got at. The railway from\r\nSuakin to Berber, instead of serving the advance on Khartoum in the\r\nautumn, could not possibly be ready in time. Berber, instead of being\r\ntaken before the hot season, could not be touched. Lord Wolseley, instead\r\nof being able to proceed with his present forces or a moderate addition,\r\nwas already asking for twelve more battalions of infantry, with a\r\nproportion of other arms.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone’s own view of this crisis is to be found in a memorandum\r\ndated April 9, circulated to the cabinet three or four days before the\r\nquestion came up for final settlement. (M70) It is long, but then the case\r\nwas intricate and the stages various. The reader may at least be satisfied\r\nto know that he will have little more of it.(114)\r\n\r\nThree cabinets were held on three successive days (April 13-15). On the\r\nevening of the first day Mr. Gladstone sent a telegram to the Queen, then\r\nabroad, informing her that in the existing state of foreign affairs, her\r\nministers felt bound to examine the question of the abandonment of\r\noffensive operations in the Soudan and the evacuation of the territory.\r\nThe Queen, in reply, was rather vehement against withdrawal, partly on the\r\nground that it would seriously affect our position in India. The Queen had\r\nthroughout made a great point that the fullest powers should be granted to\r\nthose on the spot, both Wolseley and Baring having been selected by the\r\ngovernment for the offices they held. No question cuts deeper in the art\r\nof administering a vast system like that of Great Britain, than the\r\ninfluence of the agent at a distant place; nowhere is the balance of peril\r\nbetween too slack a rein from home and a rein too tight, more delicate.\r\nMr. Gladstone, perhaps taught by the experience of the Crimean war, always\r\nstrongly inclined to the school of the tight rein, though I never heard of\r\nany representative abroad with a right to complain of insufficient support\r\nfrom a Gladstone cabinet.(115) On this aspect of matters, so raised by the\r\nQueen, Mr. Gladstone had (March 15) expressed his view to Sir Henry\r\nPonsonby:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sir Evelyn Baring was appointed to carry onwards a declared and\r\n    understood policy in Egypt, when all share in the management of\r\n    the Soudan was beyond our province. To Lord Wolseley as general of\r\n    the forces in Egypt, and on account of the arduous character of\r\n    the work before him, we are bound to render in all military\r\n    matters a firm and ungrudging support. We have accordingly not\r\n    scrupled to counsel, on his recommendation, very heavy charges on\r\n    the country, and military operations of the highest importance.\r\n    But we have no right to cast on him any responsibility beyond what\r\n    is strictly military. It is not surely possible that he should\r\n    decide policy, and that we should adopt and answer for it, even\r\n    where it is in conflict with the announcements we have made in\r\n    parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time of these critical cabinets in April Sir Evelyn Baring had\r\nspontaneously expressed his views, and with a full discussion recommended\r\nabandonment of the expedition to Khartoum.\r\n\r\nOn the second day the matter was again probed and sifted and weighed.\r\n\r\nAt the third cabinet the decision was taken to retire from the Soudan, and\r\nto fix the southern frontier of Egypt at the line where it was left for\r\ntwelve years, until apprehension of designs of another European power on\r\nthe upper waters of the Nile was held to demand a new policy. Meanwhile,\r\nthe policy of Mr. Gladstone’s cabinet was adopted and followed by Lord\r\nSalisbury when he came into office. He was sometimes pressed to reverse\r\nit, and to overthrow the dervish power at Khartoum. To any importunity of\r\nthis kind, Lord Salisbury’s answer was until 1896 unwavering.(116)\r\n\r\nIt may be worth noting that, in the course of his correspondence with the\r\nQueen on the change of policy in the Soudan, Mr. Gladstone casually\r\nindulged in the luxury of a historical parallel. “He must assure your\r\nMajesty,” he wrote in a closing sentence (April 20), “that at least he has\r\nnever in any cabinet known any question more laboriously or more\r\nconscientiously discussed; and he is confident that the basis of action\r\nhas not been the mere change in the public view (which, however, is in\r\nsome cases imperative, as it was with King George III. in the case of the\r\nAmerican war), but a deep conviction of what the honour and interest of\r\nthe empire require them as faithful servants of your Majesty to advise.”\r\n(M71) The most harmless parallel is apt to be a challenge to discussion,\r\nand the parenthesis seems to have provoked some rejoinder from the Queen,\r\nfor on April 28 Mr. Gladstone wrote to her secretary a letter which takes\r\nhim away from Khartoum to a famous piece of the world’s history:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Sir Henry Ponsonby._\r\n\r\n    In further prosecution of my reply to your letter of the 25th, I\r\n    advert to your remarks upon Lord North. I made no reference to his\r\n    conduct, I believe, in writing to her Majesty. What I endeavoured\r\n    to show was that King George III., without changing his opinion of\r\n    the justice of his war against the colonies, was obliged to give\r\n    it up on account of a change of public opinion, and was not open\r\n    to blame for so doing.\r\n\r\n    You state to me that Lord North never flinched from his task till\r\n    it became hopeless, that he then resigned office, but did not\r\n    change his opinions to suit the popular cry. The implied contrast\r\n    to be drawn with the present is obvious. I admit none of your\r\n    three propositions. Lord North did not, as I read history, require\r\n    to change his opinions to suit the popular cry. They were already\r\n    in accordance with the popular cry; and it is a serious reproach\r\n    against him that without sharing his master’s belief in the\r\n    propriety of the war, he long persisted in carrying it on, through\r\n    subserviency to that master.\r\n\r\n    Lord North did not resign office for any reason but because he\r\n    could not help it, being driven from it by some adverse votes of\r\n    the House of Commons, to which he submitted with great good\r\n    humour, and probably with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n    Lord North did not, so far as I know, state the cause to be\r\n    hopeless. Nor did those who were opposed to him. The movers of the\r\n    resolution that drove him out of office did not proceed upon that\r\n    ground. General Conway in his speech advised the retention of the\r\n    ground we held in the colonies, and the resolution, which\r\n    expressed the sense of the House as a body, bears a singular\r\n    resemblance to the announcement we have lately made, as it\r\n    declares, in its first clause, that the further prosecution of\r\n    offensive war (on the continent of America) “will be the means of\r\n    weakening the efforts of this country against her European\r\n    enemies,” February 27, 1782. This was followed, on March 4, by an\r\n    address on the same basis; and by a resolution declaring that any\r\n    ministers who should advise or attempt to frustrate it should be\r\n    considered “as enemies to his Majesty and to this country.” I\r\n    ought, perhaps, to add that I have never stated, and I do not\r\n    conceive, that a change in the public opinion of the country is\r\n    the ground on which the cabinet have founded the change in their\r\n    advice concerning the Soudan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader has by this time perhaps forgotten how Mr. Gladstone\r\ngood-humouredly remonstrated with Lord Palmerston for associating him as\r\none of the same school as Cobden and Bright.(117) The twenty intervening\r\nyears had brought him more and more into sympathy with those two eminent\r\ncomrades in good causes, but he was not any less alive to the\r\ninconvenience of the label. Speaking in Midlothian after the dissolution\r\nin 1880, he denied the cant allegation that to instal the liberals in\r\npower would be to hand over the destinies of the country to the Manchester\r\nschool.(118) “Abhorring all selfishness of policy,” he said, “friendly to\r\nfreedom in every country of the earth attached, to the modes of reason,\r\ndetesting the ways of force, this Manchester school, this peace-party, has\r\nsprung prematurely to the conclusion that wars may be considered as having\r\nclosed their melancholy and miserable history, and that the affairs of the\r\nworld may henceforth be conducted by methods more adapted to the dignity\r\nof man, more suited both to his strength and to his weakness, less likely\r\nto lead him out of the ways of duty, to stimulate his evil passions, to\r\nmake him guilty before God for inflicting misery on his fellow-creatures.”\r\nSuch a view, he said, was a serious error, though it was not only a\r\nrespectable, it was even a noble error. Then he went on, “However much you\r\nmay detest war—and you cannot detest it too much—there is no war—except\r\none, the war for liberty—that does not contain in it elements of\r\ncorruption, as well as of misery, that are deplorable to recollect and to\r\nconsider; but however deplorable wars may be, they are among the\r\nnecessities of our condition; and there are times when justice, when\r\nfaith, when the welfare of mankind, require a man not to shrink from the\r\nresponsibility of undertaking them. And if you undertake war, so also you\r\nare often obliged to undertake measures that may lead to war.”(119)\r\n\r\nIt is also, if not one of the necessities, at least one of the natural\r\nprobabilities of our imperfect condition, that when a nation has its\r\nforces engaged in war, that is the moment when other nations may press\r\ninconvenient questions of their own. Accordingly, as I have already\r\nmentioned, when Egyptian distractions were at their height, a dangerous\r\ncontroversy arose with Russia in regard to the frontier of Afghanistan.\r\nThe question had been first raised a dozen years before without effect,\r\nbut it was now sharpened into actuality by recent advances of Russia in\r\nCentral Asia, bringing her into close proximity to the territory of the\r\nAmeer. The British and Russian governments appointed a commission to lay\r\ndown the precise line of division between the Turcoman territory recently\r\nannexed by Russia and Afghanistan. The question of instructions to the\r\ncommission led to infinite discussion, of which no sane man not a\r\nbiographer is now likely to read one word. While the diplomatists were\r\nthus teasing one another, Russian posts and Afghan pickets came closer\r\ntogether, and one day (March 30, 1885) the Russians broke in upon the\r\nAfghans at Penjdeh. The Afghans fought gallantly, their losses were heavy,\r\nand Penjdeh was occupied by the Russians. “Whose was the provocation,” as\r\nMr. Gladstone said later, “is a matter of the utmost consequence. We only\r\nknow that the attack was a Russian attack. We know that the Afghans\r\nsuffered in life, in spirit, and in repute. We know that a blow was struck\r\nat the credit and the authority of a sovereign—our protected ally—who had\r\ncommitted no offence. All I say is, we cannot in that state of things\r\nclose this book and say, ‘We will look into it no more.’ We must do our\r\nbest to have right done in the matter.”\r\n\r\nHere those who were most adverse to the Soudan policy stood firmly with\r\ntheir leader, and when Mr. Gladstone proposed a vote of credit for eleven\r\nmillions, of which six and a half were demanded to meet “the case for\r\npreparation,” raised by the collision at Penjdeh, he was supported with\r\nmuch more than a mechanical loyalty, alike by the regular opposition and\r\nby independent adherents below his own gangway. The speech in which he\r\nmoved this vote of a war supply (April 27) was an admirable example both\r\nof sustained force and lucidity in exposition, and of a combined firmness,\r\ndignity, reserve, and right human feeling, worthy of a great minister\r\ndealing with an international situation of extreme delicacy and peril.\r\nMany anxious moments followed; for the scene of quarrel was far off,\r\ndetails were hard to clear up, diplomacy was sometimes ambiguous, popular\r\nexcitement was heated, and the language of faction was unmeasured in its\r\nviolence. The preliminary resolution on the vote of credit had been\r\nreceived with acclamation, but a hostile motion was made from the front\r\nopposition bench (May 11), though discord on a high imperial matter was\r\nobviously inconvenient enough for the public interest. The mover declared\r\nthe government to have murdered so many thousand men and to have arranged\r\na sham arbitration, and this was the prelude to other speeches in the same\r\nkey. Sir S. Northcote supported the motion—one to displace the ministers\r\non a bill that it was the declared intention not to oppose. The division\r\nwas taken at half-past two in the morning, after a vigorous speech from\r\nthe prime minister, and the government only counted 290 against 260. In\r\nthe minority were 42 followers of Mr. Parnell. This premature debate\r\ncleared the air. Worked with patience and with vigorous preparations at\r\nthe back of conciliatory negotiation, the question was prosecuted to a\r\nhappy issue, and those who had done their (M72) best to denounce Mr.\r\nGladstone and Lord Granville for trampling the interests and honour of\r\ntheir country underfoot thought themselves very lucky, when the time came\r\nfor them to take up the threads, in being able to complete the business by\r\nadopting and continuing the selfsame line. With justifiable triumph Mr.\r\nGladstone asked how they would have confronted Russia if “that insane\r\npolicy—for so I still must call it”—of Afghan occupation which he had\r\nbrought to an end in 1880, had been persevered in. In such a case, when\r\nRussia came to advance her claim so to adjust boundaries as to make her\r\nimmediate neighbour to Afghanistan, she would have found the country full\r\nof friends and allies, ready to join her in opposing the foreigner and the\r\ninvader; and she would have been recognised as the liberator.(120)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some respects Mr. Gladstone was never more wonderful than in the few\r\nweeks that preceded the fall of his second administration. Between the\r\nmiddle of April and the middle of May, he jots down with half-rueful\r\nhumour the names of no fewer than nine members of the cabinet who within\r\nthat period, for one reason or another and at one moment or another,\r\nappeared to contemplate resignation; that is to say a majority. Of one\r\nmeeting he said playfully to a colleague, “A very fair cabinet to-day—only\r\nthree resignations.” The large packets of copious letters of this date,\r\nwritten and received, show him a minister of unalterable patience,\r\nunruffled self-command; inexhaustible in resource, catching at every straw\r\nfrom the resource of others, indefatigable in bringing men of divergent\r\nopinions within friendly reach of one another; of tireless ingenuity in\r\nminimising differences and convincing recalcitrants that what they took\r\nfor a yawning gulf was in fact no more than a narrow trench that any\r\ndecent political gymnast ought to be ashamed not to be able to vault over.\r\nThough he takes it all as being in the day’s work, in the confidence of\r\nthe old jingle, that be the day short or never so long, at length it\r\nringeth to evensong, he does not conceal the burden. To Mrs. Gladstone he\r\nwrites from Downing Street on May-day:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Rather oppressed and tired with the magnitude and the complication\r\n    of subjects on my mind, I did not think of writing by the first\r\n    post, but I will now supply the omission by making use of the\r\n    second. As to all the later history of this ministry, which is now\r\n    entering on its sixth year, it has been a wild romance of\r\n    politics, with a continual succession of hairbreadth escapes and\r\n    strange accidents pressing upon one another, and it is only from\r\n    the number of dangers we have passed through already, that one can\r\n    be bold enough to hope we may pass also through what yet remain.\r\n    Some time ago I told you that dark as the sky was with many a\r\n    thunder-cloud, there were the possibilities of an admirable\r\n    situation and result, and _for me_ a wind-up better than at any\r\n    time I could have hoped. Russia and Ireland are the two _great_\r\n    dangers remaining. The “ray” I mentioned yesterday for the first\r\n    is by no means extinct to-day, but there is nothing new of a\r\n    serious character; what there is, is good. So also upon the Irish\r\n    complications there is more hope than there was yesterday,\r\n    although the odds may still be heavily against our getting forward\r\n    unitedly in a satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 2, as he was looking at the pictures in the Academy, Lord Granville\r\nbrought him tidings of the Russian answer, which meant peace. His short\r\nentries tell a brave story:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _May 3, Sunday._—Dined at Marlborough House. They were most kind\r\n    and pleasant. But it is so unsundaylike and unrestful. I am much\r\n    fatigued in mind and body. Yet very happy. _May 4._—Wrote to Lord\r\n    Spencer, Mr. Chamberlain, Sir C. Dilke, Lord Granville. Conclave.\r\n    H. of C., 4-¾-8-½ and 9-½-2-½. Spoke on Russian question. A heavy\r\n    day. Much knocked up. _May 5._—... Another anxious, very anxious\r\n    day, and no clearing of the sky as yet. But after all that has\r\n    come, what may not come? _May 14, Ascension Day._—Most of the day\r\n    was spent in anxious interviews, and endeavours to bring and keep\r\n    the members of the cabinet together. _May 15._—Cabinet 2-4-½.\r\n    Again stiff. But I must not lose heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M73) Difference of opinion upon the budget at one time wore a threatening\r\nlook, for the radicals disliked the proposed increase of the duty on beer;\r\nbut Mr. Gladstone pointed out in compensation that on the other hand the\r\nequalisation of the death duties struck at the very height of class\r\npreference. Mr. Childers was, as always, willing to accommodate\r\ndifficulties; and in the cabinet the rising storm blew over. Ireland never\r\nblows over.\r\n\r\nThe struggle had gone on for three years. Many murderers had been hanged,\r\nthough more remained undetected; conspirators had fled; confidence was\r\nrestored to public officers; society in all its various grades returned\r\nexternally to the paths of comparative order; and the dire emergency of\r\nthree years before had been brought to an apparent close. The gratitude in\r\nthis country to the viceroy who had achieved this seeming triumph over the\r\nforces of disorder was such as is felt to a military commander after a\r\nhazardous and successful campaign. The country was once more\r\nhalf-conquered, but nothing was advanced, and the other half of the\r\nconquest was not any nearer. The scene was not hopeful. There lay\r\nIreland,—squalid, dismal, sullen, dull, expectant, sunk deep in hostile\r\nintent. A minority with these misgivings and more felt that the minister’s\r\npregnant phrase about the government “having no moral force behind them”\r\ntoo exactly described a fatal truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI. Defeat Of Ministers. (May-June 1885)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Οὔπω\r\n    τὰν Διὸς ἁρμονίαν\r\n    θνατῶν παρεξίασι βουλαί.\r\n\r\n    —ÆSCH. _Prom._ V. 548.\r\n\r\n    Never do counsels of mortal men thwart the ordered purpose of\r\n    Zeus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was to be the Irish policy? The Crimes Act would expire in August,\r\nand the state of parties in parliament and of sections within the cabinet,\r\ntogether with the approach of the general election, made the question\r\nwhether that Act should be renewed, and if so on what terms, an issue of\r\ncrucial importance. There were good grounds for suspecting that tories\r\nwere even then intimating to the Irish that if Lord Salisbury should come\r\ninto office, they would drop coercion, just as the liberals had dropped it\r\nwhen they came into office in 1880, and like them would rely upon the\r\nordinary law. On May 15 Mr. Gladstone announced in terms necessarily\r\nvague, because the new bill was not settled, that they proposed to\r\ncontinue what he described as certain clauses of a valuable and equitable\r\ndescription in the existing Coercion Act.\r\n\r\nNo parliamentary situation could be more tempting to an astute opposition.\r\nThe signs that the cabinet was not united were unmistakable. The leader of\r\nthe little group of four clever men below the gangway on the tory side\r\ngave signs that he espied an opportunity. This was one of the occasions\r\nthat disclosed the intrepidity of Lord Randolph Churchill. He made a\r\nspeech after Mr. Gladstone’s announcement of a (M74) renewal of portions\r\nof the Crimes Act, not in his place but at a tory club. He declared\r\nhimself profoundly shocked that so grave an announcement should have been\r\ntaken as a matter of course. It was really a terrible piece of news.\r\nIreland must be in an awful state, or else the radical members of the\r\ncabinet would never have assented to such unanswerable evidence that the\r\nliberal party could not govern Ireland without resort to that arbitrary\r\nforce which their greatest orators had so often declared to be no remedy.\r\nIt did not much matter whether the demand was for large powers or for\r\nsmall. Why not put some kind thoughts towards England in Irish minds, by\r\nusing the last days of this unlucky parliament to abrogate all that harsh\r\nlegislation which is so odious to England, and which undoubtedly abridges\r\nthe freedom and insults the dignity of a sensitive and imaginative race?\r\nThe tory party should be careful beyond measure not to be committed to any\r\nact or policy which should unnecessarily wound or injure the feelings of\r\nour brothers on the other side of the channel of St. George.(121)\r\n\r\nThe key to an operation that should at once, with the aid of the\r\ndisaffected liberals and the Irish, turn out Mr. Gladstone and secure the\r\nEnglish elections, was an understanding with Mr. Parnell. The price of\r\nsuch an understanding was to drop coercion, and that price the tory\r\nleaders resolved to pay. The manœuvre was delicate. If too plainly\r\ndisclosed, it might outrage some of the tory rank and file who would\r\nloathe an Irish alliance, and it was likely, moreover, to deter some of\r\nthe disaffected liberals from joining in any motion for Mr. Gladstone’s\r\noverthrow. Lord Salisbury and his friends considered the subject with\r\n“immense deliberation some weeks before the fall of the government.” They\r\ncame to the conclusion that in the absence of official information, they\r\ncould see nothing to warrant a government in applying for a renewal of\r\nexceptional powers. That conclusion they profess to have kept sacredly in\r\ntheir own bosoms. Why they should give immense deliberation to a decision\r\nthat in their view must be worthless without official information, and\r\nthat was to remain for an indefinite time in mysterious darkness, was\r\nnever explained when this secret decision some months later was revealed\r\nto the public.(122) If there was no intention of making the decision known\r\nto the Irishmen, the purpose of so unusual a proceeding would be\r\ninscrutable. Was it made known to them? Mr. McCarthy, at the time acting\r\nfor his leader, has described circumstantially how the Irish were\r\nendeavouring to obtain a pledge against coercion; how two members of the\r\ntory party, one of them its recognised whip, came to him in succession\r\ndeclaring that they came straight from Lord Salisbury with certain\r\npropositions; how he found the assurance unsatisfactory, and asked each of\r\nthese gentlemen in turn on different nights to go back to Lord Salisbury,\r\nand put further questions to him; and how each of them professed to have\r\ngone back to Lord Salisbury, to have conferred with him, and to have\r\nbrought back his personal assurance.(123) On the other hand, it has been\r\nuniformly denied by the tory leaders that there was ever any compact\r\nwhatever with the Irishmen at this moment. We are not called upon here to\r\ndecide in a conflict of testimony which turns, after all, upon words so\r\nnotoriously slippery as pledge, compact, or understanding. It is enough to\r\nmark what is not denied, that Lord Salisbury and his confidential friends\r\nhad resolved, subject to official information, to drop coercion, and that\r\nthe only visible reason why they should form the resolution at that\r\nparticular moment was its probable effect upon Mr. Parnell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the ministerial camp. There the whig wing of the\r\ncabinet, adhering to Lord Spencer, were for a modified renewal of the\r\nCoercion Act, with the balm of a land purchase bill and a limited\r\nextension of self-government in local areas. The radical wing were averse\r\nto coercion, and averse to a purchase bill, but they were willing to yield\r\na milder form of coercion, on condition that the cabinet would agree not\r\nmerely to small measures of self-government in local areas, but to the\r\nerection of a (M75) central board clothed with important administrative\r\nfunctions for the whole of Ireland. In the House of Commons it was certain\r\nthat a fairly strong radical contingent would resist coercion in any\r\ndegree, and a liberal below the gangway, who had not been long in\r\nparliament but who had been in the press a strong opponent of the coercion\r\npolicy of 1881, at once gave notice that if proposals were made for the\r\nrenewal of exceptional law, he should move their rejection. Mr. Gladstone\r\nhad also to inform the Queen that in what is considered the whig or\r\nmoderate section of the House there had been recent indications of great\r\ndislike to special legislation, even of a mild character, for Ireland.\r\nThese proceedings are all of capital importance in an eventful year, and\r\nbear pretty directly upon the better known crisis of the year following.\r\n\r\nA memorandum by Mr. Gladstone of a conversation between himself and Lord\r\nGranville (May 6) will best show his own attitude at this opening of a\r\nmomentous controversy:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    ... I told him [Granville] I had given no pledge or indication of\r\n    my future conduct to Mr. Chamberlain, who, however, knew my\r\n    opinions to be strong in favour of some plan for a Central Board\r\n    of Local Government in Ireland on something of an elective\r\n    basis.... Under the circumstances, while the duty of the hour\r\n    evidently was to study the means of possible accommodation, the\r\n    present aspect of affairs was that of a probable split,\r\n    _independently_ of the question what course I might individually\r\n    pursue. My opinions, I said, were very strong and inveterate. I\r\n    did not calculate upon Parnell and his friends, nor upon Manning\r\n    and his bishops. Nor was I under any obligation to follow or act\r\n    with Chamberlain. But independently of all questions of party, of\r\n    support, and of success, I looked upon the extension of a strong\r\n    measure of local government like this to Ireland, now that the\r\n    question is effectually revived by the Crimes Act, as invaluable\r\n    itself, and as the only hopeful means of securing crown and state\r\n    from an ignominious surrender in the next parliament after a\r\n    mischievous and painful struggle. (I did not advert to the\r\n    difficulties which will in this session be experienced in carrying\r\n    on a great battle for the Crimes Act.) My difficulty would lie not\r\n    in my pledges or declarations (though these, of a public\r\n    character, are serious), but in my opinions.\r\n\r\n    Under these circumstances, I said, I take into view the freedom of\r\n    my own position. My engagements to my colleagues are fulfilled;\r\n    the great Russian question is probably settled; if we stand firm\r\n    on the Soudan, we are now released from that embarrassment; and\r\n    the Egyptian question, if the financial convention be safe, no\r\n    longer presents any very serious difficulties. I am entitled to\r\n    lay down my office as having done my work.\r\n\r\n    Consequently the very last thing I should contemplate is opening\r\n    the Irish difficulty in connection with my resignation, should I\r\n    resign. It would come antecedently to any parliamentary treatment\r\n    of that problem. If thereafter the secession of some members\r\n    should break up the cabinet, it would leave behind it an excellent\r\n    record at home and abroad. Lord Granville, while ready to resign\r\n    his office, was not much consoled by this presentation of the\r\n    case.\r\n\r\n\r\nLate in the month (May 23) Mr. Gladstone wrote a long letter to the Queen,\r\ngiving her “some idea of the shades of opinion existing in the cabinet\r\nwith reference to legislation for Ireland.” He thought it desirable to\r\nsupply an outline of this kind, because the subject was sure to recur\r\nafter a short time, and was “likely to exercise a most important influence\r\nin the coming parliament on the course of affairs.” The two points on\r\nwhich there was considerable divergence of view were the expiry of the\r\nCrimes Act, and the concession of local government. The Irish viceroy was\r\nready to drop a large portion of what Mr. Gladstone called coercive\r\nprovisions, while retaining provisions special to Ireland, but favouring\r\nthe efficiency of the law. Other ministers were doubtful whether any\r\nspecial legislation was needed for Irish criminal law. Then on the point\r\nwhether the new bill should be for two years or one, some, including Mr.\r\nGladstone and Lord Spencer, were for the longer term, others, including\r\nMr. Chamberlain and Sir Charles Dilke, for the shorter. At last the whole\r\ncabinet agreed to two years. Next for local government,—some held that a\r\nliberal move in this region (M76) would possibly obviate all need for\r\nspecial criminal legislation, and would at any rate take the sting out of\r\nit. To this “vastly important subject” the prime minister presumed to draw\r\nthe Queen’s special attention, as involving great and far-reaching\r\nquestions. He did not, he said, regard the differences of leaning in the\r\ncabinet upon these matters with either surprise or dismay. Such\r\ndifficulties were due to inherent difficulties in the matters themselves,\r\nand were to be expected from the action of independent and energetic minds\r\nin affairs so complex.\r\n\r\nThere were two main opinions. One favoured the erection of a system of\r\nrepresentative county government in Ireland. The other view was that\r\nbesides the county boards, there should be in addition a central board for\r\nall Ireland, essentially municipal and not political; in the main\r\nexecutive and administrative, but also with a power to make bye-laws,\r\nraise funds, and pledge public credit in such modes as parliament should\r\nprovide. The central board would take over education, primary, in part\r\nintermediate, and perhaps even higher; poor law and sanitary\r\nadministration; and public works. The whole charge of justice, police, and\r\nprisons would remain with the executive. This board would not be directly\r\nelective by the whole Irish people; it would be chosen by the\r\nrepresentative county boards. Property, moreover, should have a\r\nrepresentation upon it distinct from numbers. This plan, “first made known\r\nto Mr. Gladstone by Mr. Chamberlain,” would, he believed, be supported by\r\nsix out of the eight Commons ministers. But a larger number of ministers\r\nwere not prepared to agree to any plan involving the principle of an\r\nelective central board as the policy of the cabinet. On account of this\r\npreliminary bar, the particular provisions of the policy of a central\r\nboard were not discussed.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, was for the moment retrospective and historic, because\r\na fortnight before the letter was written, the policy of the central\r\nboard, of which Mr. Gladstone so decisively approved, had been killed. A\r\ncommittee of the cabinet was appointed to consider it; some remained\r\nstubbornly opposed; as the discussion went on, some changed their minds\r\nand, having resisted, at last inclined to acquiesce. Ministers were aware\r\nfrom the correspondence of one of them with an eminent third person, that\r\nMr. Parnell approved the scheme, and in consideration of it would even not\r\noppose a very limited Crimes bill. This, however, was no temptation to all\r\nof them; perhaps it had the contrary effect. When it came to the full\r\ncabinet, it could not be carried. All the peers except Lord Granville were\r\nagainst it. All the Commoners except Lord Hartington were for it. As the\r\ncabinet broke up (May 9), the prime minister said to one colleague, “Ah,\r\nthey will rue this day”; and to another, “Within six years, if it please\r\nGod to spare their lives, they will be repenting in sackcloth and ashes.”\r\nLater in the day he wrote to one of them, “The division of opinion in the\r\ncabinet on the subject of local government with a central board for\r\nIreland was so marked, and if I may use the expression, so diametrical,\r\nthat I dismissed the subject from my mind, and sorrowfully accepted the\r\nnegative of what was either a majority, or a moiety of the entire\r\ncabinet.”\r\n\r\nThis decision, more profoundly critical than anybody excepting Mr.\r\nGladstone and perhaps Mr. Chamberlain seemed to be aware, left all\r\nexisting difficulties as acute as ever. In the middle of May things looked\r\nvery black. The scheme for a central board was dead, though, wrote Mr.\r\nGladstone to the viceroy, “for the present only. _It will quickly rise\r\nagain, as I think, perhaps in larger dimensions._” Some members of the\r\ncabinet, he knew not how many, would resign rather than demand from\r\nparliament, without a Central Board bill, the new Coercion Act. If such\r\nresignations took place, how was a Coercion bill to be fought through the\r\nHouse, when some liberals had already declared that they would resist it?\r\n\r\nOn May 15 drafts not only of a Coercion bill, but of a bill for land\r\npurchase, came before the cabinet. Much objection was taken to land\r\npurchase, especially by the two radical leaders, and it was agreed to\r\nforego such a bill for the present session. The viceroy gravely lamented\r\nthis decision, and Mr. Gladstone entered into communication with Mr. (M77)\r\nChamberlain and Sir C. Dilke. From them he understood that their main\r\nanxiety sprang from a fear lest the future handling of local government\r\nshould be prejudiced by premature disposal of the question of land\r\npurchase, but that in the main they thought the question of local\r\ngovernment would not be prejudiced if the purchase bill only provided\r\nfunds for a year. Under this impression and with a full belief that he was\r\ngiving effect to the real desire of his colleagues in general to meet the\r\nviews of Lord Spencer, and finding the prospects of such a bill\r\nfavourable, Mr. Gladstone proceeded (May 20) to give notice of its\r\nintroduction. Mr. Chamberlain and Sir C. Dilke took this to be a reversal\r\nof the position to which they had agreed, and would not assent to land\r\npurchase unless definitely coupled with assurances as to local government.\r\nThey immediately resigned. The misapprehension was explained, and though\r\nthe resignations were not formally withdrawn, they were suspended. But the\r\ntwo radical leaders did not conceal their view of the general state of the\r\ncase, and in very direct terms told Mr. Gladstone that they differed so\r\ncompletely on the questions that were to occupy parliament for the rest of\r\nthe session, as to feel the continuance of the government of doubtful\r\nadvantage to the country. In Mr. Chamberlain’s words, written to the prime\r\nminister at the time of the misunderstanding (May 21)—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I feel there has been a serious misapprehension on both sides with\r\n    respect to the Land Purchase bill, and I take blame to myself if I\r\n    did not express myself with sufficient clearness.... I doubt very\r\n    much if it is wise or was right to cover over the serious\r\n    differences of principle that have lately disclosed themselves in\r\n    the cabinet. I think it is now certain that they will cause a\r\n    split in the new parliament, and it seems hardly fair to the\r\n    constituencies that this should only be admitted, after they have\r\n    discharged their function and are unable to influence the result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nStill the prime minister altogether declined, in his own phrase, to lose\r\nheart, and new compromises were invented. Meanwhile he cheerfully went for\r\nthe Whitsuntide recess to Hawarden, and dived into Lechler’s _Wycliffe_,\r\nWalpole’s _George III._, Conrad on German Union, Cooper on the Atonement,\r\nand so forth. Among other guests at Hawarden came Lord Wolverton, “with\r\nmuch conversation; we opened rather a new view as to my retirement.” What\r\nthe new view was we do not know, but the conversation was resumed and\r\nagain resumed, until the unwelcome day (June 4) for return to Downing\r\nStreet. Before returning, however, Mr. Gladstone set forth his view of the\r\ninternal crisis in a letter to Lord Hartington:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Lord Hartington._\r\n\r\n    _May 30, 1885._—I am sorry but not surprised that your rather\r\n    remarkable strength should have given way under the pressure of\r\n    labour or anxiety or both. Almost the whole period of this\r\n    ministry, particularly the year and a half since the defeat of\r\n    Hicks, and most particularly of all, the four months since the\r\n    morning when you deciphered the Khartoum telegram at Holker, have\r\n    been without example in my experience, as to the gravity and\r\n    diversity of difficulties which they have presented. What I hope\r\n    is that they will not discourage you, or any of our colleagues, in\r\n    your anticipations of the future. It appears to me that there is\r\n    not one of them, viewed in the gross, which has been due to our\r\n    own action. By viewing in the gross, I mean taking the Egyptian\r\n    question as one. When we subdivide between Egypt proper and the\r\n    Soudan, I find what seem to me two grave errors in our management\r\n    of the Soudan business: the first our _landing_ at Suakin, the\r\n    second the mission of Gordon, or rather the choice of Gordon for\r\n    that mission. But it sometimes happens that the errors gravest in\r\n    their consequences are also the most pardonable. And these errors\r\n    were surely pardonable enough in themselves, without relying on\r\n    the fact that they were approved by the public opinion of the day\r\n    and by the opposition. Plenty of other and worse errors have been\r\n    urged upon us which we have refused or avoided. I do not remember\r\n    a single good measure recommended by opponents, which we have\r\n    declined to adopt (or indeed any good measure which they have\r\n    recommended at all). We certainly have worked hard. I believe that\r\n    according to the measure of human infirmity, we have done fairly\r\n    well, but the duties we have had to discharge have been duties, I\r\n    mean in Egypt and the Soudan, which it was impossible to discharge\r\n    with the ordinary measure of credit and satisfaction, which were\r\n    beyond human strength, and which it was very unwise of our\r\n    predecessors to saddle upon the country.\r\n\r\n    At this moment we have but two great _desiderata_: the Egyptian\r\n    Convention and the Afghan settlement (the evacuation of the Soudan\r\n    being in principle a thing done). Were these accomplished, we\r\n    should have attained for the empire at home and abroad a position\r\n    in most respects unusually satisfactory, and both of them _ought_\r\n    to be near accomplishment. With the Egyptian Convention fairly at\r\n    work, I should consider the Egyptian question as within a few\r\n    comparatively easy stages of satisfactory solution.\r\n\r\n    Now as regards the immediate subject. What if Chamberlain and\r\n    Dilke, as you seem to anticipate, raise the question of a\r\n    prospective declaration about local government in Ireland as a\r\n    condition of their remaining in the cabinet? I consider that\r\n    question as disposed of for the present (much against my will),\r\n    and I do not see that any of us, having accepted the decision, can\r\n    attempt to disturb it. Moreover, their ground will be very weak\r\n    and narrow; for their actual reason of going, if they go, will be\r\n    the really small question arising upon the Land Purchase bill.\r\n\r\n    I think they will commit a great error if they take this course.\r\n    It will be straining at the gnat. No doubt it will weaken the\r\n    party at the election, but I entertain no fear of the immediate\r\n    effect. Their error will, however, in my view go beyond this.\r\n    Forgive me if I now speak with great frankness on a matter, one of\r\n    few, in which I agree with them, and not with you. I am firmly\r\n    convinced that on local government for Ireland they hold a winning\r\n    position; which by resignation now they will greatly compromise.\r\n    You will all, I am convinced, have to give what they recommend; at\r\n    the least what they recommend.\r\n\r\n    There are two differences between them and me on this subject.\r\n    First as to the matter; I go rather further than they do; for I\r\n    would undoubtedly make a _beginning_ with the Irish police.\r\n    Secondly as to the _ground_; here I differ seriously. I do not\r\n    reckon with any confidence upon Manning or Parnell; I have never\r\n    looked much in Irish matters at negotiation or the conciliation of\r\n    leaders. I look at the question in itself, and I am deeply\r\n    convinced that the measure in itself will (especially if\r\n    accompanied with similar measures elsewhere, _e.g._ in Scotland)\r\n    be good for the country and the empire; I do not say unmixedly\r\n    good, but with advantages enormously outweighing any drawbacks.\r\n\r\n    Apart from these differences, and taking their point of view, I\r\n    think they ought to endeavour to fight the election with you; and\r\n    in the _new state of affairs_ which will be presented after the\r\n    dissolution, try and see what effect may be produced upon your\r\n    mind, and on other minds, when you have to look at the matter\r\n    _cominus_ and not _eminus_, as actual, and not as hypothetical. I\r\n    gave Chamberlain a brief hint of these speculations when\r\n    endeavouring to work upon him; otherwise I have not mentioned them\r\n    to any one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day of his return to London from Hawarden Mr. Gladstone had an\r\ninterview with the two ministers with whom on the merits he was most\r\ndisposed to agree, though he differed strongly from them as to tactics.\r\nResignations were still only suspended, yet the prospects of compromise\r\nwere hopeful. At a cabinet held on the following day (June 5) it was\r\nagreed that he should in the course of a week give notice of a bill to\r\ntake the place of the expiring Crimes Act. The point left open was whether\r\nthe operative provisions of such an Act—agreed on some time before—should\r\nnot be brought into operation without some special act of the executive\r\ngovernment, by proclamation, order in council, or otherwise. Local\r\ngovernment was still left open. Lord Spencer crossed over from Ireland on\r\nthe night of June 7, and the cabinet met next day. All differences were\r\nnarrowed down to the point whether the enactments against intimidation\r\nshould be inoperative unless and until the lord lieutenant should waken\r\nthem into life by proclamation. As it happened, intimidation had been for\r\na considerable time upon the increase—from which it might be inferred\r\neither, on the one side, that coercion failed in its object, or, on the\r\nother, that more coercion was still indispensable. The precise state in\r\nwhich matters were left at the eleventh hour before the crisis, now\r\nswiftly advancing, (M78) was set out by Mr. Gladstone in a letter written\r\nby him to the Queen in the autumn (October 5), when he was no longer her\r\nMajesty’s minister:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To the Queen._\r\n\r\n    ... He has perceived that in various quarters misapprehension\r\n    prevails as to the point at which the deliberations of the late\r\n    cabinet on the question of any renewal of, or substitution for,\r\n    the Crimes Act in Ireland had arrived when their financial defeat\r\n    on the 8th of June caused the tender of their resignation.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gladstone prays your Majesty’s gracious permission to remove\r\n    this misapprehension by simply stating that which occurred in the\r\n    cabinet at its latest meetings, with reference to this particular\r\n    question. Substantially it would be a repetition, or little more\r\n    (and without any mention of names), of his latest reports to your\r\n    Majesty, to the effect—\r\n\r\n    1. That the cabinet had long before arrived at the conclusion that\r\n    the coercion clauses of the Act, properly so called, might be\r\n    safely abandoned.\r\n\r\n    2. With regard to the other clauses, which might be generally\r\n    described as procedure clauses, they intended as a rule to advise,\r\n    not their absolute re-enactment, but that the viceroy should be\r\n    empowered to bring them into action, together or separately, as\r\n    and when he might see cause.\r\n\r\n    3. But that, with respect to the intimidation or boycotting\r\n    provisions, it still remained for consideration whether they\r\n    should thus be left subject to executive discretion, or whether,\r\n    as the offence had not ceased, they should, as an effective\r\n    instrument of repression, remain in direct and full operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is worth noticing here as a signal instance of Mr. Gladstone’s\r\ntenacious and indomitable will after his defeat, that in a communication\r\nto the Queen four days later (June 12), he stated that the single\r\noutstanding point of difference on the Crimes bill was probably in a fair\r\nway of settlement, but that even if the dissent of the radical members of\r\nthe cabinet had become operative, it was his firm intention to make new\r\narrangements for filling the vacant offices and carrying on the\r\ngovernment. The overthrow came in a different way. The deliberations thus\r\nsummarised had been held under the shadow of a possibility, mentioned to\r\nthe Queen in the report of this last cabinet, of a coalition between the\r\ntories and the Irish nationalists, in order to put an end to the existence\r\nof the government on their budget. This cloud at last burst, though Mr.\r\nGladstone at any rate with his usual invincible adherence to the salutary\r\nrule never to bid good morrow to the devil until you meet him, did not\r\nstrongly believe in the risk. The diary sheds no light on the state of his\r\nexpectations:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _June 6._... Read Amiel’s _Journal Intime_. Queen’s birthday\r\n    dinner, 39; went very well. Much conversation with the Prince of\r\n    Wales, who was handy and pleasant even beyond his wont. Also had\r\n    some speech of his son, who was on my left. _June 7, Trinity\r\n    Sunday._—Chapel Royal at noon and 5.30. Wrote.... Saw Lord\r\n    Granville; ditto _cum_ Kimberley. Read Amiel. Edersheim on Old\r\n    Testament. _June 8._—Wrote, etc.... Pitiless rain. Cabinet,\r\n    2-3-¾.... Spoke on budget. Beaten by 264:252. Adjourned the House.\r\n    This is a considerable event.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amendment that led to this “considerable event” was moved by Sir\r\nMichael Hicks Beach. The two points raised by the fatal motion were,\r\nfirst, the increased duty on beer and spirits without a corresponding\r\nincrease on wine; and, second, the increase of the duty on real property\r\nwhile no relief was given to rates. The fiscal issue is not material. What\r\nwas ominous was the alliance that brought about the result.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of the Gladstone government was the first success of a\r\ncombination between tories and Irish, that proved of cardinal importance\r\nto policies and parties for several critical months to come. By a\r\ncoincidence that cut too deep to be mere accident, divisions in the\r\nGladstone cabinet found their counterpart in insurrection among the tory\r\nopposition. The same general forces of the hour, working through the\r\nenergy, ambition, and initiative of individuals, produced the same effect\r\nin each of the two parties; the radical programme of Mr. Chamberlain was\r\nmatched by the (M79) tory democracy of Lord Randolph Churchill; each saw\r\nthat the final transfer of power from the ten-pound householder to\r\nartisans and labourers would rouse new social demands; each was aware that\r\nIreland was the electoral pivot of the day, and while one of them was\r\nwrestling with those whom he stigmatised as whigs, the other by dexterity\r\nand resolution overthrew his leaders as “the old gang.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII. Accession Of Lord Salisbury. (1885)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Politics are not a drama where scenes follow one another according\r\n    to a methodical plan, where the actors exchange forms of speech,\r\n    settled beforehand: politics are a conflict of which chance is\r\n    incessantly modifying the whole course.—SOREL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nIn tendering his resignation to the Queen on the day following his\r\nparliamentary defeat (June 9), and regretting that he had been unable to\r\nprepare her for the result, Mr. Gladstone explained that though the\r\ngovernment had always been able to cope with the combined tory and\r\nnationalist oppositions, what had happened on this occasion was the silent\r\nwithdrawal, under the pressure of powerful trades, from the government\r\nranks of liberals who abstained from voting, while six or seven actually\r\nvoted with the majority. “There was no previous notice,” he said, “and it\r\nwas immediately before the division that Mr. Gladstone was apprised for\r\nthe first time of the likelihood of a defeat.” The suspicions hinted that\r\nministers, or at least some of them, unobtrusively contrived their own\r\nfall. Their supporters, it was afterwards remarked, received none of those\r\nimperative adjurations to return after dinner that are usual on solemn\r\noccasions; else there could never have been seventy-six absentees. The\r\nmajority was composed of members of the tory party, six liberals, and\r\nthirty-nine nationalists. Loud was the exultation of the latter contingent\r\nat the prostration of the coercion system. What was natural exultation in\r\nthem, may have taken the form of modest satisfaction among many liberals,\r\nthat they could go to the country without the obnoxious label of coercion\r\ntied round their necks. As for ministers, it was observed that if in the\r\nstreets you saw a man coming along with a particularly elastic step and a\r\njoyful frame of (M80) countenance, ten to one on coming closer you would\r\nfind that it was a member of the late cabinet.(124)\r\n\r\nThe ministerial crisis of 1885 was unusually prolonged, and it was\r\ncurious. The victory had been won by a coalition with the Irish; its\r\nfruits could only be reaped with Irish support; and Irish support was to\r\nthe tory victors both dangerous and compromising. The normal process of a\r\ndissolution was thought to be legally impossible, because by the\r\nredistribution bill the existing constituencies were for the most part\r\nradically changed; and a new parliament chosen on the old system of seats\r\nand franchise, even if it were legally possible, would still be empty of\r\nall semblance of moral authority. Under these circumstances, some in the\r\ntory party argued that instead of taking office, it would be far better\r\nfor them to force Mr. Gladstone and his cabinet to come back, and leave\r\nthem to get rid of their internal differences and their Irish\r\nembarrassments as they best could. Events were soon to demonstrate the\r\nprudence of these wary counsels. On the other hand, the bulk of the tory\r\nparty like the bulk of any other party was keen for power, because power\r\nis the visible symbol of triumph over opponents, and to shrink from office\r\nwould discourage their friends in the country in the electoral conflict\r\nnow rapidly approaching.\r\n\r\nThe Queen meanwhile was surprised (June 10) that Mr. Gladstone should make\r\nhis defeat a vital question, and asked whether, in case Lord Salisbury\r\nshould be unwilling to form a government, the cabinet would remain. To\r\nthis Mr. Gladstone replied that to treat otherwise an attack on the\r\nbudget, made by an ex-cabinet minister with such breadth of front and\r\nafter all the previous occurrences of the session, would be contrary to\r\nevery precedent,—for instance, the notable case of December 1852,—and it\r\nwould undoubtedly tend to weaken and lower parliamentary government.(125)\r\nIf an opposition defeated a government, they must be prepared to accept\r\nthe responsibility of their action. As to the second question, he answered\r\nthat a refusal by Lord Salisbury would obviously change the situation. On\r\nthis, the Queen accepted the resignations (June 11), and summoned Lord\r\nSalisbury to Balmoral. The resignations were announced to parliament the\r\nnext day. Remarks were made at the time, indeed by the Queen herself, at\r\nthe failure of Mr. Gladstone to seek the royal presence. Mr. Gladstone’s\r\nexplanation was that, viewing “the probably long reach of Lord\r\nHartington’s life into the future,” he thought that he would be more\r\nuseful in conversation with her Majesty than “one whose ideas might be\r\nunconsciously coloured by the limited range of the prospect before him,”\r\nand Lord Hartington prepared to comply with the request that he should\r\nrepair to Balmoral. The visit was eventually not thought necessary by the\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\nIn his first audience Lord Salisbury stated that though he and his friends\r\nwere not desirous of taking office, he was ready to form a government; but\r\nin view of the difficulties in which a government formed by him would\r\nstand, confronted by a hostile majority and unable to dissolve, he\r\nrecommended that Mr. Gladstone should be invited to reconsider his\r\nresignation. Mr. Gladstone, however (June 13), regarded the situation and\r\nthe chain of facts that had led up to it, as being so definite, when\r\ncoupled with the readiness of Lord Salisbury to undertake an\r\nadministration, that it would be a mere waste of valuable time for him to\r\nconsult his colleagues as to the resumption of office. Then Lord Salisbury\r\nsought assurances of Mr. Gladstone’s support, as to finance, parliamentary\r\ntime, and other points in the working of executive government. These\r\nassurances neither Mr. Gladstone’s own temperament, nor the humour of his\r\nfriends and his party—for the embers of the quarrel with the Lords upon\r\nthe franchise bill were still hot—allowed him to give, and he founded\r\nhimself on the precedent of the communications of December 1845 between\r\nPeel and Russell. In this default of assurances, Lord Salisbury thought\r\nthat he should render the Queen no useful service by taking office. So\r\nconcluded the first stage.\r\n\r\n(M81) Though declining specific pledges, Mr. Gladstone now wrote to the\r\nQueen (June 17) that in the conduct of the necessary business of the\r\ncountry, he believed there would be no disposition to embarrass her\r\nministers. Lord Salisbury, however, and his colleagues were unanimous in\r\nthinking this general language insufficient. The interregnum continued. On\r\nthe day following (June 18), Mr. Gladstone had an audience at Windsor,\r\nwhither the Queen had now returned. It lasted over three-quarters of an\r\nhour. “The Queen was most gracious and I thought most reasonable.”\r\n(_Diary._) He put down in her presence some heads of a memorandum to\r\nassist her recollection, and the one to which she rightly attached most\r\nvalue was this: “In my opinion,” Mr. Gladstone wrote, “the whole value of\r\nany such declaration as at the present circumstances permit, really\r\ndepends upon the spirit in which it is given and taken. For myself and any\r\nfriend of mine, I can only say that the spirit in which we should\r\nendeavour to interpret and apply the declaration I have made, would be the\r\nsame spirit in which we entered upon the recent conferences concerning the\r\nSeats bill.” To this declaration his colleagues on his return to London\r\ngave their entire and marked approval, but they would not compromise the\r\nliberty of the House of Commons by further and particular pledges.\r\n\r\nIt was sometimes charged against Mr. Gladstone that he neglected his duty\r\nto the crown, and abandoned the Queen in a difficulty. This is wholly\r\nuntrue. On June 20, Sir Henry Ponsonby called and opened one or two\r\naspects of the position, among them these:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. Can the Queen do anything more?\r\n\r\n    I answered, As you ask me, it occurs to me that it might help Lord\r\n    Salisbury’s going on, were she to make reference to No. 2 of my\r\n    memorandum [the paragraph just quoted], and to say that in her\r\n    judgment he would be safe in receiving it in a spirit of trust.\r\n\r\n    2. If Lord Salisbury fails, may the Queen rely on you?\r\n\r\n    I answered that on a previous day I had said that if S. failed,\r\n    the situation would be altered. I hoped, and on the whole thought,\r\n    he would go on. But if he did not? I could not promise or expect\r\n    smooth water. The movement of questions such as the Crimes Act and\r\n    Irish Local Government might be accelerated. But my desire would\r\n    be to do my best to prevent the Queen being left without a\r\n    government.(126)\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone’s view of the position is lucidly stated in the following\r\nmemorandum, like the others, in his own hand, (June 21):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. I have endeavoured in my letters (_a_) to avoid all\r\n    controversial matter; (_b_) to consider not what the incoming\r\n    ministers had a right to ask, but what it was possible for us in a\r\n    spirit of conciliation to give.\r\n\r\n    2. In our opinion there was no right to demand from us anything\r\n    whatever. The declarations we have made represent an extreme of\r\n    concession. The conditions required, _e.g._ the first of them\r\n    [control of time], place in abeyance the liberties of parliament,\r\n    by leaving it solely and absolutely in the power of the ministers\r\n    to determine on what legislative or other questions (except\r\n    supply) it shall be permitted to give a judgment. The House of\r\n    Commons may and ought to be disposed to facilitate the progress of\r\n    all necessary business by all reasonable means as to supply and\r\n    otherwise, but would deeply resent any act of ours by which we\r\n    agreed beforehand to the extinction of its discretion.\r\n\r\n    The difficulties pleaded by Lord Salisbury were all in view when\r\n    his political friend, Sir M. H. Beach, made the motion which, as\r\n    we apprised him, would if carried eject us from office, and are\r\n    simply the direct consequences of their own action. If it be true\r\n    that Lord Salisbury loses the legal power to advise and the crown\r\n    to grant a dissolution, that cannot be a reason for leaving in the\r\n    hands of the executive an absolute power to stop the action\r\n    (except as to supply) of the legislative and corrective power of\r\n    the House of Commons. At the same time these conditions do not\r\n    appear to me to attain the end proposed by Lord Salisbury, for it\r\n    would still be left in the power of the House to refuse supplies,\r\n    and thereby to bring about in its worst form the difficulty which\r\n    he apprehends.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt looked for a couple of days as if he would be compelled (M82) to\r\nreturn, even though it would almost certainly lead to disruption of the\r\nliberal cabinet and party.(127) The Queen, acting apparently on Mr.\r\nGladstone’s suggestion of June 20, was ready to express her confidence in\r\nMr. Gladstone’s assurance that there would be no disposition on the part\r\nof himself or his friends to embarrass new ministers. By this expression\r\nof confidence, the Queen would thus make herself in some degree\r\nresponsible as it were for the action of the members of the defeated\r\nGladstone government in the two Houses. Still Lord Salisbury’s\r\ndifficulties—and some difficulties are believed to have arisen pretty\r\nacutely within the interior conclaves of his own party—remained for\r\nforty-eight hours insuperable. His retreat to Hatfield was taken to mark a\r\nsecond stage in the interregnum.\r\n\r\nJune 22 is set down in the diary as “a day of much stir and vicissitude.”\r\nMr. Gladstone received no fewer than six visits during the day from Sir\r\nHenry Ponsonby, whose activity, judgment, and tact in these duties of\r\ninfinite delicacy were afterwards commemorated by Lord Granville in the\r\nHouse of Lords.(128) He brought up from Windsor the draft of a letter that\r\nmight be written by the Queen to Lord Salisbury, testifying to her belief\r\nin the sincerity and loyalty of Mr. Gladstone’s words. Sir Henry showed\r\nthe draft to Mr. Gladstone, who said that he could not be party to certain\r\npassages in it, though willing to agree to the rest. The draft so altered\r\nwas submitted to Lord Salisbury; he demanded modification, placing a more\r\ndefinite interpretation on the words of Mr. Gladstone’s previous letters\r\nto the Queen. Mr. Gladstone was immovable throughout the day in declining\r\nto admit any modifications in the sense desired; nor would he consent to\r\nbe privy to any construction or interpretation placed upon his words which\r\nLord Salisbury, with no less tenacity than his own, desired to extend.\r\n\r\n\r\n    At 5.40 [June 22] Sir H. Ponsonby returned for a fifth interview,\r\n    his infinite patience not yet exhausted.... He said the Queen\r\n    believed the late government did not wish to come back. I simply\r\n    reminded him of my previous replies, which, he remembered, nearly\r\n    as follows:—That if Lord Salisbury failed, the situation would be\r\n    altered. That I could not in such a case promise her Majesty\r\n    smooth water. That, however, a great duty in such circumstances\r\n    lay upon any one holding my situation, to use his best efforts so\r\n    as, _quoad_ what depended upon him, not to leave the Queen without\r\n    a government. I think he will now go to Windsor.—_June 22, ’85_, 6\r\n    P.M.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day (June 23), the Queen sent on to Lord Salisbury the letter\r\nwritten by Mr. Gladstone on June 21, containing his opinion that\r\nfacilities of supply might reasonably be provided, without placing the\r\nliberties of the House of Commons in abeyance, and further, his\r\ndeclaration that he felt sure there was no idea of withholding ways and\r\nmeans, and that there was no danger to be apprehended on that score. In\r\nforwarding this letter, the Queen expressed to Lord Salisbury her earnest\r\ndesire to bring to a close a crisis calculated to endanger the best\r\ninterests of the state; and she felt no hesitation in further\r\ncommunicating to Lord Salisbury her opinion that he might reasonably\r\naccept Mr. Gladstone’s assurances. In deference to these representations\r\nfrom the Queen, Lord Salisbury felt it his duty to take office, the crisis\r\nended, and the tory party entered on the first portion of a term of power\r\nthat was destined, with two rather brief interruptions, to be prolonged\r\nfor many years.(129) In reviewing this interesting episode in the annals\r\nof the party system, it is impossible not to observe the dignity in form,\r\nthe patriotism in substance, the common-sense in result, that marked the\r\nproceedings alike of the sovereign and of her two ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter accepting Mr. Gladstone’s resignation the Queen, on June 13,\r\nproffered him a peerage:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _The Queen to Mr. Gladstone._\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gladstone mentioned in his last letter but one, his intention\r\n    of proposing some honours. But before she considers these, she\r\n    wishes to offer him an Earldom, as a mark of her recognition of\r\n    his long and distinguished services, and she believes and thinks\r\n    he will thereby be enabled still to render great service to his\r\n    sovereign and country—which if he retired, as he has repeatedly\r\n    told her of late he intended to do shortly,—he could not. The\r\n    country would doubtless be pleased at any signal mark of\r\n    recognition of Mr. Gladstone’s long and eminent services, and the\r\n    Queen believes that it would be beneficial to his health,—no\r\n    longer exposing him to the pressure from without, for more active\r\n    work than he ought to undertake. Only the other day—without\r\n    reference to the present events—the Queen mentioned to Mrs.\r\n    Gladstone at Windsor the advantage to Mr. Gladstone’s health of a\r\n    removal from one House to the other, in which she seemed to agree.\r\n    The Queen trusts, therefore, that Mr. Gladstone will accept the\r\n    offer of an earldom, which would be very gratifying to her.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe outgoing minister replied on the following day:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gladstone offers his humble apology to your Majesty. It would\r\n    not be easy for him to describe the feelings with which he has\r\n    read your Majesty’s generous, most generous letter. He prizes\r\n    every word of it, for he is fully alive to all the circumstances\r\n    which give it value. It will be a precious possession to him and\r\n    to his children after him. All that could recommend an earldom to\r\n    him, it already has given him. He remains, however, of the belief\r\n    that he ought not to avail himself of this most gracious offer.\r\n    Any service that he can render, if small, will, however, be\r\n    greater in the House of Commons than in the House of Lords; and it\r\n    has never formed part of his views to enter that historic chamber,\r\n    although he does not share the feeling which led Sir R. Peel to\r\n    put upon record what seemed a perpetual or almost a perpetual\r\n    self-denying ordinance for his family.\r\n\r\n    When the circumstances of the state cease, as he hopes they may\r\n    ere long, to impose on him any special duty, he will greatly covet\r\n    that interval between an active career and death, which the\r\n    profession of politics has always appeared to him especially to\r\n    require. There are circumstances connected with the position of\r\n    his family, which he will not obtrude upon your Majesty, but\r\n    which, as he conceives, recommend in point of prudence the\r\n    personal intention from which he has never swerved. He might\r\n    hesitate to act upon the motives to which he has last adverted,\r\n    grave as they are, did he not feel rooted in the persuasion that\r\n    the small good he may hope hereafter to effect, can best be\r\n    prosecuted without the change in his position. He must beg your\r\n    Majesty to supply all that is lacking in his expression from the\r\n    heart of profound and lasting gratitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Lord Granville, the nearest of his friends, he wrote on the same day:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I send you herewith a letter from the Queen which moves and almost\r\n    upsets me. It must have cost her much to write, and it is really a\r\n    pearl of great price. Such a letter makes the subject of it\r\n    secondary—but though it would take me long to set out my reasons,\r\n    I remain firm in the intention to accept nothing for myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Granville replied that he was not surprised at the decision. “I\r\nshould have greatly welcomed you,” he said, “and under some circumstances\r\nit might be desirable, but I think you are right now.”\r\n\r\nHere is Mr. Gladstone’s letter to an invaluable occupant of the\r\nall-important office of private secretary:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Mr. E. W. Hamilton._\r\n\r\n    _June 30, 1885._—Since you have in substance (and in form?)\r\n    received the appointment [at the Treasury], I am unmuzzled, and\r\n    may now express the unbounded pleasure which it gives me, together\r\n    with my strong sense (not disparaging any one else) of your\r\n    desert. The modesty of your letter is as remarkable as its other\r\n    qualities, and does you the highest honour. I can accept no\r\n    tribute from you, or from any one, with regard to the office of\r\n    private secretary under me except this, that it has always been\r\n    made by me a strict and severe office, and that this is really the\r\n    only favour I have ever done you, or any of your colleagues to\r\n    whom in their several places and measures I am similarly obliged.\r\n\r\n    As to your services to me they have been simply indescribable. No\r\n    one I think could dream, until by experience he knew, to what an\r\n    extent in these close personal relations devolution can be\r\n    carried, and how it strengthens the feeble knees and thus also\r\n    sustains the fainting heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe declaration of the Irish policy of the new government was made to\r\nparliament by no less a personage than the lord-lieutenant.(130) The prime\r\nminister had discoursed on frontiers in Asia and frontiers in Africa, but\r\non Ireland he was silent. Lord Carnarvon, on the contrary, came forward\r\nvoluntarily with a statement of policy, and he opened it on the broadest\r\ngeneral lines. His speech deserves as close attention as any deliverance\r\nof this memorable period. It laid down the principles of that alternative\r\nsystem of government, with which the new ministers formally challenged\r\ntheir predecessors. Ought the Crimes Act to be re-enacted as it stood; or\r\nin part; or ought it to be allowed to lapse? These were the three courses.\r\nNobody, he thought, would be for the first, because some provisions had\r\nnever been put in force; others had been put in force but found useless;\r\nand others again did nothing that might not be done just as well under the\r\nordinary law. The re-enactment of the whole statute, therefore, was\r\ndismissed. But the powers for changing venue at the discretion of the\r\nexecutive; for securing special juries at the same discretion; for holding\r\nsecret inquiry without an accused person; for dealing summarily with\r\ncharges of intimidation—might they not be continued? They were not\r\nunconstitutional, and they were not opposed to legal instincts. No, all\r\nquite true; but then the Lords should not conceal from themselves that\r\ntheir re-enactment would be in the nature of special or exceptional\r\nlegislation. He had been looking through coercion Acts, he continued, and\r\nhad been astonished to find that ever since 1847, with some very short\r\nintervals hardly worth mentioning, Ireland had lived under exceptional and\r\ncoercive legislation. What sane man could admit this to be a satisfactory\r\nor a wholesome state of things? Why should not they try to extricate\r\nthemselves from this miserable habit, and aim at some better solution?\r\n“Just as I have seen in English colonies across the sea a combination of\r\nEnglish, Irish, and Scotch settlers bound together in loyal obedience to\r\nthe law and the crown, and contributing to the general prosperity of the\r\ncountry, so I cannot conceive that there is any irreconcilable bar here in\r\ntheir native home and in England to the unity and the amity of the two\r\nnations.” He went to his task individually with a perfectly free, open,\r\nand unprejudiced mind, to hear, to question, and, as far as might be, to\r\nunderstand. “My Lords, I do not believe that with honesty and\r\nsingle-mindedness of purpose on the one side, and with the willingness of\r\nthe Irish people on the other, it is hopeless to look for some\r\nsatisfactory solution of this terrible question. My Lords, these I believe\r\nto be the opinions and the views of my colleagues.”(131)\r\n\r\nThis remarkable announcement, made in the presence of the prime minister,\r\nin the name of the cabinet as a whole, and by a man of known purity and\r\nsincerity of character, was taken to be an express renunciation, not\r\nmerely of the policy of which notice had been given by the outgoing\r\nadministration, but of coercion as a final instrument of imperial rule. It\r\nwas an elaborate repudiation in advance of that panacea of firm and\r\nresolute government, which became so famous before twelve months were\r\nover. It was the suggestion, almost in terms, that a solution should be\r\nsought in that policy which had brought union both within our colonies,\r\nand between the colonies and the mother country, and men did not forget\r\nthat this suggestion was being made by a statesman who had carried\r\nfederation in Canada, and tried to carry it in South Africa. We cannot\r\nwonder that upon leading members of the late government, and especially\r\nupon the statesman who had been specially responsible for Ireland, the\r\nimpression was startling and profound. Important members of the tory party\r\nhurried (M83) from Ireland to Arlington Street, and earnestly warned their\r\nleader that he would never be able to carry on with the ordinary law. They\r\nwere coldly informed that Lord Salisbury had received quite different\r\ncounsel from persons well acquainted with the country.\r\n\r\nThe new government were not content with renouncing coercion for the\r\npresent. They cast off all responsibility for its practice in the past.\r\nOstentatiously they threw overboard the viceroy with whom the only fault\r\nthat they had hitherto found, was that his sword was not sharp enough. A\r\nmotion was made by the Irish leader calling attention to the\r\nmaladministration of the criminal law by Lord Spencer. Forty men had been\r\ncondemned to death, and in twenty-one of these cases the capital sentence\r\nhad been carried out. Of the twenty-one executions six were savagely\r\nimpugned, and Mr. Parnell’s motion called for a strict inquiry into these\r\nand some other convictions, with a view to the full discovery of truth and\r\nthe relief of innocent persons. The debate soon became famous from the\r\nprincipal case adduced, as the Maamtrasna debate. The topic had been so\r\ncopiously discussed as to occupy three full sittings of the House in the\r\nprevious October. The lawyer who had just been made Irish chancellor, at\r\nthat time pronounced against the demand. In substance the new government\r\nmade no fresh concession. They said that if memorials or statements were\r\nlaid before him, the viceroy would carefully attend to them. No minister\r\ncould say less. But incidental remarks fell from the government that\r\ncreated lively alarm in tories and deep disgust in liberals. Sir Michael\r\nHicks Beach, then leader of the House, told them that while believing Lord\r\nSpencer to be a man of perfect honour and sense of duty, “he must say very\r\nfrankly that there was much in the Irish policy of the late government\r\nwhich, though in the absence of complete information he did not condemn,\r\nhe should be very sorry to make himself responsible for.”(132) An even\r\nmore important minister emphasised the severance of the new policy from\r\nthe old. “I will tell you,” cried Lord Randolph Churchill, “how the\r\npresent government is foredoomed to failure. They will be foredoomed to\r\nfailure if they go out of their way unnecessarily to assume one jot or\r\ntittle of the responsibility for the acts of the late administration. It\r\nis only by divesting ourselves of all responsibility for the acts of the\r\nlate government, that we can hope to arrive at a successful issue.”(133)\r\n\r\nTory members got up in angry fright, to denounce this practical\r\nacquiescence by the heads of their party in what was a violent Irish\r\nattack not only upon the late viceroy, but upon Irish judges, juries, and\r\nlaw officers. They remonstrated against “the pusillanimous way” in which\r\ntheir two leaders had thrown over Lord Spencer. “During the last three\r\nyears,” said one of these protesting tories, “Lord Spencer has upheld\r\nrespect for law at the risk of his life from day to day, with the\r\nsanction, with the approval, and with the acknowledgment inside and\r\noutside of this House, of the country, and especially of the conservative\r\nparty. Therefore I for one will not consent to be dragged into any\r\nimplied, however slight, condemnation of Lord Spencer, because it happens\r\nto suit the exigencies of party warfare.”(134) This whole transaction\r\ndisgusted plain men, tory and liberal alike; it puzzled calculating men;\r\nand it had much to do with the silent conversion of important and leading\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe general sentiment about the outgoing viceroy took the form of a\r\nbanquet in his honour (July 24), and some three hundred members of the two\r\nHouses attended, including Lord Hartington, who presided, and Mr. Bright.\r\nThe two younger leaders of the radical wing who had been in the late\r\ncabinet neither signed the invitation nor were present. But on the same\r\nevening in another place, Mr. Chamberlain recognised the high qualities\r\nand great services of Lord Spencer, though they had not always agreed upon\r\ndetails. He expressed, however, his approval both of the policy and of the\r\narguments which had led the new government to drop the Crimes Act. At the\r\nsame time he denounced the “astounding tergiversation” of ministers, and\r\nenergetically declared that “a strategic movement of that kind, executed\r\nin opposition to the notorious convictions of the men who effected it,\r\ncarried out for party purposes and party purposes alone, is the most\r\nflagrant instance of political dishonesty this country has ever known.”\r\n(M84) Lord Hartington a few weeks later told his constituents that the\r\nconduct of the government, in regard to Ireland, had dealt a heavy blow\r\n“both at political morality, and at the cause of order in Ireland.” The\r\nseverity of such judgments from these two weighty statesmen testifies to\r\nthe grave importance of the new departure.\r\n\r\nThe enormous change arising from the line adopted by the government was\r\nvisible enough even to men of less keen vision than Mr. Gladstone, and it\r\nwas promptly indicated by him in a few sentences in a letter to Lord Derby\r\non the very day of the Maamtrasna debate:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Within the last two or three weeks, he wrote, the situation has\r\n    undergone important changes. I am not fully informed, but what I\r\n    know looks as if the Irish party so-called in parliament, excited\r\n    by the high biddings of Lord Randolph, had changed what was\r\n    undoubtedly Parnell’s ground until within a very short time back.\r\n    It is now said that a central board will not suffice, and that\r\n    there must be a parliament. This I suppose may mean the repeal of\r\n    the Act of Union, or may mean an Austro-Hungarian scheme, or may\r\n    mean that Ireland is to be like a great colony such as Canada. Of\r\n    all or any of these schemes I will now only say that, of course,\r\n    they constitute an entirely new point of departure and raise\r\n    questions of an order totally different to any that are involved\r\n    in a central board appointed for local purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Derby recording his first impressions in reply (July 19) took the\r\nrather conventional objection made to most schemes on all subjects, that\r\nit either went too far or did not go far enough. Local government he\r\nunderstood, and home rule he understood, but a quasi-parliament in Dublin,\r\nnot calling itself such though invested with most of the authority of a\r\nparliament, seemed to him to lead to the demand for fuller recognition. If\r\nwe were forced, he said, to move beyond local government as commonly\r\nunderstood, he would rather have Ireland treated like Canada. “But the\r\ndifficulties every way are enormous.” On this Mr. Gladstone wrote a little\r\nlater to Lord Granville (Aug. 6):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    As far as I can learn, both you and Derby are on the same lines as\r\n    Parnell, in rejecting the smaller and repudiating the larger\r\n    scheme. It would not surprise me if he were to formulate something\r\n    on the subject. For my own part I have seen my way pretty well as\r\n    to the particulars of the minor and rejected plan, but the idea of\r\n    the wider one puzzles me much. At the same time, _if_ the election\r\n    gives a return of a decisive character, the sooner the subject is\r\n    dealt with the better.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo little true is it to say that Mr. Gladstone only thought of the\r\npossibility of Irish autonomy after the election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nApart from public and party cares, the bodily machinery gave trouble, and\r\nthe fine organ that had served him so nobly for so long showed serious\r\nsigns of disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Lord Richard Grosvenor._\r\n\r\n    _July 14._—After two partial examinations, a thorough examination\r\n    of my throat (larynx _versus_ pharynx) has been made to-day by Dr.\r\n    Semon in the presence of Sir A. Clark, and the result is rather\r\n    bigger than I had expected. It is, that I have a fair chance of\r\n    real recovery provided I keep silent almost like a Trappist, but\r\n    all treatment would be nugatory without this rest; that the other\r\n    alternative is nothing dangerous, but merely the constant passage\r\n    of the organ from bad to worse. He asked what demands the H. of C.\r\n    would make on me. I answered about three speeches of about five\r\n    minutes each, but he was not satisfied and wished me to get rid of\r\n    it altogether, which I must do, perhaps saying instead a word by\r\n    letter to some friend. Much time has almost of necessity been\r\n    lost, but I must be rigid for the future, and even then I shall be\r\n    well satisfied if I get back before winter to a natural use of the\r\n    voice in conversation. This imports a considerable change in the\r\n    course of my daily life. Here it is difficult to organise it\r\n    afresh. At Hawarden I can easily do it, but there I am at a\r\n    distance from the best aid. I am disposed to “_top up_,” with a\r\n    sea voyage, but this is No. 3—Nos. 1 and 2 being rest and then\r\n    treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sea voyage that was to “top up” the rest of the treatment began on\r\nAugust 8, when the Gladstones became the guests of Sir Thomas and Lady\r\nBrassey on the _Sunbeam_. They sailed from Greenhithe to Norway, and after\r\na three weeks’ cruise, were set ashore at Fort George on September 1. Mr.\r\nGladstone made an excellent tourist; was full of interest in all he saw;\r\nand, I dare say, drew some pleasure from the demonstrations of curiosity\r\nand admiration that attended his presence from the simple population\r\nwherever he moved. Long expeditions with much climbing and scrambling were\r\nhis delight, and he let nothing beat him. One of these excursions, the\r\nascent to the Vöringfos, seems to deserve a word of commemoration, in the\r\ninterest either of physiology or of philosophic musings after Cicero’s\r\nmanner upon old age. “I am not sure,” says Lady Brassey in her most\r\nagreeable diary of the cruise,(135) “that the descent did not seem rougher\r\nand longer than our journey up had been, although, as a matter of fact, we\r\ngot over the ground much more quickly. As we crossed the green pastures on\r\nthe level ground near the village of Sæbö we met several people taking\r\ntheir evening stroll, and also a tourist apparently on his way up to spend\r\nthe night near the Vöringfos. The wind had gone down since the morning,\r\nand we crossed the little lake with fair rapidity, admiring as we went the\r\nglorious effects of the setting sun upon the tops of the precipitous\r\nmountains, and the wonderful echo which was aroused for our benefit by the\r\nboatmen. An extremely jolty drive, in springless country carts, soon\r\nbrought us to the little inn at Vik, and by half-past eight we were once\r\nmore on board the _Sunbeam_, exactly ten hours after setting out upon our\r\nexpedition, which had included a ride or walk, as the case might be, of\r\neighteen miles, independently of the journey by boat and cart—a hardish\r\nday’s work for any one, but really a wonderful undertaking for a man of\r\nseventy-five, who disdained all proffered help, and insisted on walking\r\nthe whole distance. No one who saw Mr. Gladstone that evening at dinner in\r\nthe highest spirits, and discussing subjects both grave and gay with the\r\ngreatest animation, could fail to admire his marvellous pluck and energy,\r\nor, knowing what he had shown himself capable of doing in the way of\r\nphysical exertion, could feel much anxiety on the score of the failure of\r\nhis strength.”\r\n\r\nHe was touched by a visit from the son of an old farmer, who brought him\r\nas an offering from his father to Mr. Gladstone a curiously carved\r\nNorwegian bowl three hundred years old, with two horse-head handles.\r\nStrolling about Aalesund, he was astonished to find in the bookshop of the\r\nplace a Norse translation of Mill’s _Logic_. He was closely observant of\r\nall religious services whenever he had the chance, and noticed that at\r\nLaurvig all the tombstones had prayers for the dead. He read perhaps a\r\nlittle less voraciously than usual, and on one or two days, being unable\r\nto read, he “meditated and reviewed”—always, I think, from the same point\r\nof view—the point of view of Bunyan’s _Grace Abounding_, or his own\r\nletters to his father half a century before. Not seldom a vision of the\r\ncoming elections flitted before the mind’s eye, and he made notes for what\r\nhe calls an _abbozzo_ or sketch of his address to Midlothian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IX. 1885-1886\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I. Leadership And The General Election. (1885)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Our understanding of history is spoiled by our knowledge of the\r\n    event.—HELPS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone came back from his cruise in the _Sunbeam_ at the beginning\r\nof September; leaving the yacht at Fort George and proceeding to Fasque to\r\ncelebrate his elder brother’s golden wedding. From Fasque he wrote to Lord\r\nHartington (Sept. 3): “I have returned to terra firma extremely well in\r\ngeneral health, and with a better throat; in full expectation of having to\r\nconsider anxious and doubtful matters, and now finding them rather more\r\nanxious and doubtful than I had anticipated. As yet I am free to take a\r\nshare or not in the coming political issues, and I must weigh many things\r\nbefore finally surrendering this freedom.” His first business, he wrote to\r\nSir W. Harcourt (Sept. 12), was to throw his thoughts into order for an\r\naddress to his constituents, framed only for the dissolution, and “written\r\nwith my best care to avoid treading on the toes of either the right or the\r\nleft wing.” He had communicated, he said, with Granville, Hartington, and\r\nChamberlain; by both of the two latter he had been a good deal buffeted;\r\nand having explained the general idea with which he proposed to write, he\r\nasked each of the pair whether upon the whole their wish was that he\r\nshould go on or cut out. “To this question I have not yet got a clear\r\naffirmative answer from either of them.”\r\n\r\n“The subject of Ireland,” he told Lord Hartington, “has perplexed me much\r\neven on the North Sea,” and he expressed some regret that in a recent\r\nspeech his correspondent had felt it necessary at this early period to\r\njoin issue in so pointed a manner with Mr. Parnell and his party.\r\nParnell’s speech was, no doubt, he said, “as bad as bad could be, and\r\nadmitted of only one answer. But the whole question of the position which\r\nIreland will assume after the general election is so new, so difficult,\r\nand as yet, I think, so little understood, that it seems most important to\r\nreserve until the proper time all possible liberty of examining it.”\r\n\r\nThe address to his electors, of which he had begun to think on board the\r\n_Sunbeam_, was given to the public on September 17. It was, as he said, as\r\nlong as a pamphlet, and a considerable number of politicians doubtless\r\npassed judgment upon it without reading it through. The whigs, we are\r\ntold, found it vague, the radicals cautious, the tories crafty; but\r\neverybody admitted that it tended to heal feuds. Mr. Goschen praised it,\r\nand Mr. Chamberlain, though raising his own flag, was respectful to his\r\nleader’s manifesto.(136)\r\n\r\nThe surface was thus stilled for the moment, yet the waters ran very deep.\r\nWhat were “the anxious and doubtful matters,” what “the coming political\r\nissues,” of which Mr. Gladstone had written to Lord Hartington? They were,\r\nin a word, twofold: to prevent the right wing from breaking with the left;\r\nand second, to make ready for an Irish crisis, which as he knew could not\r\nbe averted. These were the two keys to all his thoughts, words, and deeds\r\nduring the important autumn of 1885—an Irish crisis, a solid party. He was\r\nnot the first great parliamentary leader whose course lay between two\r\nimpossibilities.\r\n\r\nAll his letters during the interval between his return from the cruise in\r\nthe _Sunbeam_ and the close of the general election disclose with perfect\r\nclearness the channels in which events and his judgment upon them were\r\nmoving. Whigs and radicals alike looked to him, and across him fought\r\ntheir battle. The Duke of Argyll, for example, (M85) taking advantage of a\r\nlifelong friendship to deal faithfully with him, warned him that the long\r\nfight with “Beaconsfieldism” had thrown him into antagonism with many\r\npolitical conceptions and sympathies that once had a steady hold upon him.\r\nYet they had certainly no less value and truth than they ever had, and\r\nperhaps were more needed than ever in face of the present chaos of\r\nopinion. To this Mr. Gladstone replied at length:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To the Duke of Argyll._\r\n\r\n    _Sept. 30, 1885._—I am very sensible of your kind and sympathetic\r\n    tone, and of your indulgent verdict upon my address. It was\r\n    written with a view to the election, and as a practical document,\r\n    aiming at the union of all, it propounds for immediate action what\r\n    all are supposed to be agreed on. This is necessarily somewhat\r\n    favourable to the moderate section of the liberal party. You will\r\n    feel that it would not have been quite fair to the advanced men to\r\n    add some special reproof to them. And reproof, if I had presumed\r\n    upon it, would have been two-sided. Now as to your suggestion that\r\n    I should say something in public to indicate that I am not too\r\n    sanguine as to the future. If I am unable to go in this\r\n    direction—and something I may do—it is not from want of sympathy\r\n    with much that you say. But my first and great cause of anxiety\r\n    is, believe me, the condition of the tory party. As at present\r\n    constituted, or at any rate moved, it is destitute of all the\r\n    effective qualities of a respectable conservatism.... For their\r\n    administrative spirit I point to the Beaconsfield finance. For\r\n    their foreign policy they have invented Jingoism, and at the same\r\n    time by their conduct _re_ Lord Spencer and the Irish\r\n    nationalists, they have thrown over—and they formed their\r\n    government only by means of throwing over—those principles of\r\n    executive order and caution which have hitherto been common to all\r\n    governments....\r\n\r\n    There are other chapters which I have not time to open. I deeply\r\n    deplore the oblivion into which public economy has fallen; the\r\n    prevailing disposition to make a luxury of panics, which\r\n    multitudes seem to enjoy as they would a sensational novel or a\r\n    highly seasoned cookery; and the leaning of both parties to\r\n    socialism, which I radically disapprove. I must lastly mention\r\n    among my causes of dissatisfaction the conduct of the timid or\r\n    reactionary whigs. They make it day by day more difficult to\r\n    maintain that most valuable characteristic of our history, which\r\n    has always exhibited a good proportion of our great houses at the\r\n    head of the liberal movement. If you have ever noted of late years\r\n    a too sanguine and high-coloured anticipation of our future, I\r\n    should like to be reminded of it. I remain, and I hope always to\r\n    be, your affectionate friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe correspondence with Lord Granville sets out more clearly than anything\r\nelse could do Mr. Gladstone’s general view of the situation of the party\r\nand his own relation to it, and the operative words in this\r\ncorrespondence, in view of the maelstrom to which they were all drawing\r\nnearer, will be accurately noted by any reader who cares to understand one\r\nof the most interesting situations in the history of party. To Lord\r\nGranville he says (September 9, 1885), “The problem for me is to make if\r\npossible a statement which will hold through the election and not to go\r\ninto conflict with either the right wing of the party for whom Hartington\r\nhas spoken, or the left wing for whom Chamberlain, I suppose, spoke last\r\nnight. I do not say they are to be treated as on a footing, but I must do\r\nno act disparaging to Chamberlain’s wing.” And again to Lord Granville a\r\nmonth later (Oct. 5):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    You hold a position of great impartiality in relation to any\r\n    divergent opinions among members of the late cabinet. No other\r\n    person occupies ground so thoroughly favourable. I turn to myself\r\n    for one moment. I remain at present in the leadership of the\r\n    party, first with a view to the election, and secondly with a view\r\n    to being, by a bare possibility, of use afterwards in the Irish\r\n    question if it should take a favourable turn; but as you know,\r\n    with the intention of taking no part in any schism of the party\r\n    should it arise, and of avoiding any and all official\r\n    responsibility, should the question be merely one of liberal _v._\r\n    conservative and not one of commanding imperial necessity, such as\r\n    that of Irish government may come to be after the dissolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe goes on to say that the ground had now been sufficiently laid for going\r\nto the election with a united front, that ground being the common\r\nprofession of a limited creed (M86) or programme in the liberal sense,\r\nwith an entire freedom for those so inclined, to travel beyond it, but not\r\nto impose their own sense upon all other people. No one, he thought, was\r\nbound to determine at that moment on what conditions he would join a\r\nliberal government. If the party and its leaders were agreed as to\r\nimmediate measures on local government, land, and registration, were not\r\nthese enough to find a liberal administration plenty of work, especially\r\nwith procedure, for several years? If so, did they not supply a ground\r\nbroad enough to start a government, that would hold over, until the proper\r\ntime should come, all the questions on which its members might not be\r\nagreed, just as the government of Lord Grey held over, from 1830 to 1834,\r\nthe question whether Irish church property might or might not be applied\r\nto secular uses?\r\n\r\nAs for himself, in the event of such a government being formed (of which I\r\nsuppose Lord Granville was to be the head), “My desire would be,” he says,\r\n“to place myself in your hands for all purposes, except that of taking\r\noffice; to be present or absent from the House, and to be absent for a\r\ntime or for good, as you might on consultation and reflection think best.”\r\nIn other words Mr. Gladstone would take office to try to settle the Irish\r\nquestion, but for nothing else. Lord Granville held to the view that this\r\nwas fatal to the chances of a liberal government. No liberal cabinet could\r\nbe constructed unless Mr. Gladstone were at its head. The indispensable\r\nchief, however, remained obdurate.\r\n\r\nAn advance was made at this moment in the development of a peculiar\r\nsituation by important conversations with Mr. Chamberlain. Two days later\r\nthe redoubtable leader of the left wing came to Hawarden for a couple of\r\ndays, and Mr. Gladstone wrote an extremely interesting account of what\r\npassed to Lord Granville:(137)—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    _Hawarden, Oct. 8, 1885._—Chamberlain came here yesterday and I\r\n    have had a great deal of conversation with him. He is a good man\r\n    to talk to, not only from his force and clearness, but because he\r\n    speaks with reflection, does not misapprehend or (I think)\r\n    suspect, or make unnecessary difficulties, or endeavour to\r\n    maintain pedantically the uniformity and consistency of his\r\n    argument throughout.\r\n\r\n    As to the three points of which he was understood to say that they\r\n    were indispensable to the starting of a liberal government, I\r\n    gather that they stand as follows:—\r\n\r\n    1. As to the authority of local authorities for compulsory\r\n    expropriation.(138) To this he adheres; though I have said I could\r\n    not see the justification for withholding countenance from the\r\n    formation of a government with considerable and intelligible plans\r\n    in view, because it would not at the first moment bind all its\r\n    members to this doctrine. He intimates, however, that the form\r\n    would be simple, the application of the principle mild; that he\r\n    does not expect wide results from it, and that Hartington, he\r\n    conceives, is not disposed wholly to object to everything of the\r\n    kind.\r\n\r\n    2. As regards readjustment of taxation, he is contented with the\r\n    terms of my address, and indisposed to make any new terms.\r\n\r\n    3. As regards free education, he does not ask that its principle\r\n    be adopted as part of the creed of a new cabinet. He said it would\r\n    be necessary to reserve his right individually to vote for it. I\r\n    urged that he and the new school of advanced liberals were not\r\n    sufficiently alive to the necessity of refraining when in\r\n    government from declaring by _vote_ all their individual opinions;\r\n    that a vote founded upon time, and the engagements of the House at\r\n    the moment with other indispensable business, would imply no\r\n    disparagement to the principle, which might even be expressly\r\n    saved (“without prejudice”) by an amending resolution; that he\r\n    could hardly carry this point to the rank of a _sine quâ non_. He\r\n    said,—That the sense of the country might bind the liberal\r\n    majority (presuming it to exist) to declare its opinion, even\r\n    though unable to give effect to it at the moment; that he looked\r\n    to a single declaration, not to the sustained support of a\r\n    measure; and he seemed to allow that if the liberal sense were so\r\n    far divided as not to show a unanimous front, in that case it\r\n    might be a question whether some plan other than, and short of, a\r\n    direct vote might be pursued.(139)\r\n\r\n    The question of the House of Lords and disestablishment he regards\r\n    as still lying in the remoter distance.\r\n\r\n    All these subjects I separated entirely from the question of\r\n    Ireland, on which I may add that he and I are pretty well agreed;\r\n    unless upon a secondary point, namely, whether Parnell would be\r\n    satisfied to acquiesce in a County Government bill, good so far as\r\n    it went, maintaining on other matters his present general\r\n    attitude.(140) We agreed, I think, that a prolongation of the\r\n    present relations of the Irish party would be a national disgrace,\r\n    and the civilised world would scoff at the political genius of\r\n    countries which could not contrive so far to understand one\r\n    another as to bring their differences to an accommodation.\r\n\r\n    All through Chamberlain spoke of reducing to an absolute minimum\r\n    his idea of necessary conditions, and this conversation so far\r\n    left untouched the question of men, he apparently assuming\r\n    (wrongly) that I was ready for another three or four years’\r\n    engagement.\r\n\r\n    _Hawarden, Oct. 8, 1885._—In another “private,” but less private\r\n    letter, I have touched on measures, and I have now to say what\r\n    passed in relation to men.\r\n\r\n    He said the outline he had given depended on the supposition of my\r\n    being at the head of the government. He did not say he could\r\n    adhere to it on no other terms, but appeared to stipulate for a\r\n    new point of departure.\r\n\r\n    I told him the question of my time of life had become such, that\r\n    in any case prudence bound him, and all who have a future, to\r\n    think of what is to follow me. That if a big Irish question should\r\n    arise, and arise in such a form as to promise a possibility of\r\n    settlement, that would be a crisis with a beginning and an end,\r\n    and perhaps one in which from age and circumstances I might be\r\n    able to supply aid and service such as could not be exactly had\r\n    without me.(141) Apart from an imperious demand of this kind the\r\n    question would be that of dealing with land laws, with local\r\n    government, and other matters, on which I could render _no_\r\n    special service, and which would require me to enter into a new\r\n    contest for several years, a demand that ought not to be made, and\r\n    one to which I could not accede. I did not think the adjustment of\r\n    personal relations, or the ordinary exigencies of party,\r\n    constituted a call upon me to continue my long life in a course of\r\n    constant pressure and constant contention with half my\r\n    fellow-countrymen, until nothing remained but to step into the\r\n    grave.\r\n\r\n    He agreed that the House of Lords was not an available resort. He\r\n    thought I might continue at the head of the government, and leave\r\n    the work of legislation to others.(142) I told him that all my\r\n    life long I had had an essential and considerable share in the\r\n    legislative work of government, and to abandon it would be an\r\n    essential change, which the situation would not bear.\r\n\r\n    He spoke of the constant conflicts of opinion with Hartington in\r\n    the late cabinet, but I reverted to the time when Hartington used\r\n    to summon and lead meetings of the leading commoners, in which he\r\n    was really the least antagonistic of men.\r\n\r\n    He said Hartington might lead a whig government aided by the\r\n    tories, or might lead a radical government.... I recommended his\r\n    considering carefully the personal composition of the group of\r\n    leading men, apart from a single personality on which reliance\r\n    could hardly be placed, except in the single contingency to which\r\n    I have referred as one of a character probably brief.\r\n\r\n    He said it might be right for him to look as a friend on the\r\n    formation of a liberal government, having (as I understood)\r\n    moderate but intelligible plans, without forming part of it. I\r\n    think this was the substance of what passed.\r\n\r\n\r\nInteresting as was this interview, it did not materially alter Mr.\r\nGladstone’s disposition. After it had taken place he wrote to Lord\r\nGranville (Nov. 10):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    I quite understand how natural it is that at the present juncture\r\n    pressure, and even the whole pressure, should from both quarters\r\n    be brought to bear upon me. Well, if a special call of imperial\r\n    interest, such as I have described, should arise, I am ready for\r\n    the service it may entail, so far as my will is concerned. But a\r\n    very different question is raised. Let us see how matters stand.\r\n\r\n    A course of action for the liberals, moderate but substantial, has\r\n    been sketched. The party in general have accepted it. After the\r\n    late conversations, there is no reason to anticipate a breach upon\r\n    any of the conditions laid down anywhere for immediate adoption,\r\n    between the less advanced and the more advanced among the leaders.\r\n    It must occupy several years, and it may occupy the whole\r\n    parliament. According to your view they will, unless on a single\r\n    condition [_i.e._ Mr. Gladstone’s leadership], refuse to combine\r\n    in a cabinet, and to act, with a majority at their back; and will\r\n    make over the business voluntarily to the tories in a minority, at\r\n    the commencement of a parliament. Why? They agree on the subjects\r\n    before them. Other subjects, unknown as yet, may arise to split\r\n    them. But this is what may happen to any government, and _it_ can\r\n    form no reason.\r\n\r\n    But what _is_ the condition demanded? It is that a man of\r\n    seventy-five,(143) after fifty-three years’ service, with _no_\r\n    particular qualification for the questions in view should enter\r\n    into a fresh contract of service in the House of Commons, reaching\r\n    according to all likelihood over three, four, or five years, and\r\n    without the smallest reasonable prospect of a break. And this is\r\n    not to solve a political difficulty, but to soothe and conjure\r\n    down personal misgivings and apprehensions. I have not said\r\n    jealousies, because I do _not_ believe them to be the operative\r\n    cause; perhaps they do not exist at all.\r\n\r\n    I firmly say this is not a reasonable condition, or a tenable\r\n    demand, in the circumstances supposed. Indeed no one has\r\n    endeavoured to show that it is. Further, abated action in the\r\n    House of Commons is out of the question. We cannot have, in these\r\n    times, a figurehead prime minister. I have gone a very long way in\r\n    what I have said, and I really cannot go further.\r\n\r\n    Lord Aberdeen, taking office at barely seventy in the House of\r\n    Lords, apologised in his opening speech for doing this at a time\r\n    when his mind ought rather to be given to “other thoughts.” Lord\r\n    Palmerston in 1859 did not speak thus. But he was bound to no plan\r\n    of any kind; and he was seventy-four, _i.e._ in his seventy-fifth\r\n    year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is high time to turn to the other deciding issue in the case. Though\r\nthus stubborn against resuming the burden of leadership merely to compose\r\ndiscords between Chatsworth and Birmingham, Mr. Gladstone was ready to be\r\nof use in the Irish question, “if it should take a favourable turn.” As if\r\nthe Irish question ever took a favourable turn. We have seen in the\r\nopening of the present chapter, how he spoke to Lord Hartington of a\r\ncertain speech of Mr. Parnell’s in September, “as bad as bad could be.”\r\nThe secret of that speech was a certain fact that must be counted a\r\ncentral hinge of these far-reaching transactions. In July, a singular\r\nincident had occurred, nothing less strange than an interview between the\r\nnew lord-lieutenant and the leader of the Irish party. To realise its full\r\nsignificance, we have to recall the profound odium that at this time\r\nenveloped Mr. Parnell’s name in the minds of nearly all Englishmen. For\r\nseveral years and at that moment he figured in the public imagination for\r\nall that is sinister, treasonable, dark, mysterious, and unholy. He had\r\nstood his trial for a criminal conspiracy, and was supposed only to have\r\nbeen acquitted by the corrupt connivance of a Dublin jury. He had been\r\nflung into prison and kept there for many months without trial, as a\r\nperson reasonably suspected of lawless practices. High treason was the\r\nleast dishonourable of the offences imputed to him and commonly credited\r\nabout him. He had been elaborately accused before the House of Commons by\r\none of the most important men in it, of direct personal responsibility for\r\noutrages and murders, and he left the accusation with scant reply. He was\r\nconstantly denounced as the apostle of rapine and rebellion. That the\r\nviceroy of the Queen should (M87) without duress enter into friendly\r\ncommunication with such a man, would have seemed to most people at that\r\nday incredible and abhorrent. Yet the incredible thing happened, and it\r\nwas in its purpose one of the most sensible things that any viceroy ever\r\ndid.(144)\r\n\r\nThe interview took place in a London drawing-room. Lord Carnarvon opened\r\nthe conversation by informing Mr. Parnell, first, that he was acting of\r\nhimself and by himself, on his own exclusive responsibility; second, that,\r\nhe sought information only, and that he had not come for the purpose of\r\narriving at any agreement or understanding however shadowy; third, that he\r\nwas there as the Queen’s servant, and would neither hear nor say one word\r\nthat was inconsistent with the union of the two countries. Exactly what\r\nMr. Parnell said, and what was said in reply, the public were never\r\nauthentically told. Mr. Parnell afterwards spoke(145) as if Lord Carnarvon\r\nhad given him to understand that it was the intention of the government to\r\noffer Ireland a statutory legislature, with full control over taxation,\r\nand that a scheme of land purchase was to be coupled with it. On this, the\r\nviceroy denied that he had communicated any such intention. Mr. Parnell’s\r\nstory was this:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lord Carnarvon proceeded to say that he had sought the interview\r\n    for the purpose of ascertaining my views regarding—should he call\r\n    it?—a constitution for Ireland. But I soon found out that he had\r\n    brought me there in order that he might communicate his own views\r\n    upon the matter, as well as ascertain mine.... In reply to an\r\n    inquiry as to a proposal which had been made to build up a central\r\n    legislative body upon the foundation of county boards, I told him\r\n    I thought this would be working in the wrong direction, and would\r\n    not be accepted by Ireland; that the central legislative body\r\n    should be a parliament in name and in fact.... Lord Carnarvon\r\n    assured me that this was his own view also, and he strongly\r\n    appreciated the importance of giving due weight to the sentiment\r\n    of the Irish in this matter.... He had certain suggestions to this\r\n    end, taking the colonial model as a basis, which struck me as\r\n    being the result of much thought and knowledge of the subject....\r\n    At the conclusion of the conversation, which lasted for more than\r\n    an hour, and to which Lord Carnarvon was very much the larger\r\n    contributor, I left him, believing that I was in complete accord\r\n    with him regarding the main outlines of a settlement conferring a\r\n    legislature upon Ireland.(146)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is certainly not for me to contend that Mr. Parnell was always an\r\ninfallible reporter, but if closely scrutinised the discrepancy in the two\r\nstories as then told was less material than is commonly supposed. To the\r\npassage just quoted, Lord Carnarvon never at any time in public offered\r\nany real contradiction. What he contradicted was something different. He\r\ndenied that he had ever stated to Mr. Parnell that it was the intention of\r\nthe government, if they were successful at the polls, to establish the\r\nIrish legislature, with limited powers and not independent of imperial\r\ncontrol, which he himself favoured. He did not deny, any more than he\r\nadmitted, that he had told Mr. Parnell that on opinion and policy they\r\nwere very much at one. How could he deny it, after his speech when he\r\nfirst took office? Though the cabinet was not cognisant of the nature of\r\nthese proceedings, the prime minister was. To take so remarkable a step\r\nwithout the knowledge and assent of the head of the government, would have\r\nbeen against the whole practice and principles of our ministerial system.\r\nLord Carnarvon informed Lord Salisbury of his intention of meeting Mr.\r\n(M88) Parnell, and within twenty-four hours after the meeting, both in\r\nwriting and orally, he gave Lord Salisbury as careful and accurate a\r\nstatement as possible of what had passed. We can well imagine the close\r\nattention with which the prime minister followed so profoundly interesting\r\na report, and at the end of it he told the viceroy that “he had conducted\r\nthe conversation with Mr. Parnell with perfect discretion.” The knowledge\r\nthat the minister responsible for the government of Ireland was looking in\r\nthe direction of home rule, and exchanging home rule views with the great\r\nhome rule leader, did not shake Lord Salisbury’s confidence in his fitness\r\nto be viceroy.\r\n\r\nThis is no mere case of barren wrangle and verbal recrimination. The\r\ntransaction had consequences, and the Carnarvon episode was a pivot. The\r\neffect upon the mind of Mr. Parnell was easy to foresee. Was I not\r\njustified, he asked long afterwards, in supposing that Lord Carnarvon,\r\nholding the views that he now indicated, would not have been made viceroy\r\nunless there was a considerable feeling in the cabinet that his views were\r\nright?(147) Could he imagine that the viceroy would be allowed to talk\r\nhome rule to him—however shadowy and vague the words—unless the prime\r\nminister considered such a solution to be at any rate well worth\r\ndiscussing? Why should he not believe that the alliance formed in June to\r\nturn Mr. Gladstone out of office and eject Lord Spencer from Ireland, had\r\nreally blossomed from being a mere lobby manœuvre and election expedient,\r\ninto a serious policy adopted by serious statesmen? Was it not certain\r\nthat in such remarkable circumstances Mr. Parnell would throughout the\r\nelection confidently state the national demand at its very highest?\r\n\r\nIn 1882 and onwards up to the Reform Act of 1885, Mr. Parnell had been\r\nready to advocate the creation of a central council at Dublin for\r\nadministrative purposes merely. This he thought would be a suitable\r\nachievement for a party that numbered only thirty-five members. But the\r\nassured increase of his strength at the coming election made all the\r\ndifference. When semi-official soundings were taken from more than one\r\nliberal quarter after the fall of the Gladstone government, it was found\r\nthat Mr. Parnell no longer countenanced provisional reforms. After the\r\ninterview with Lord Carnarvon, the mercury rose rapidly to the top of the\r\ntube. Larger powers of administration were not enough. The claim for\r\nlegislative power must now be brought boldly to the front. In unmistakable\r\nterms, the Irish leader stated the Irish demand, and posed both problem\r\nand solution. He now declared his conviction that the great and sole work\r\nof himself and his friends in the new parliament would be the restoration\r\nof a national parliament of their own, to do the things which they had\r\nbeen vainly asking the imperial parliament to do for them.(148)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen politicians ruminate upon the disastrous schism that followed Mr.\r\nGladstone’s attempt to deal with the Irish question in 1886, they ought\r\nclosely to study the general election of 1885. In that election, though\r\nleading men foresaw the approach of a marked Irish crisis, and awaited the\r\noutcome of events with an overshadowing sense of pregnant issues, there\r\nwas nothing like general concentration on the Irish prospect. The strife\r\nof programmes and the rivalries of leaders were what engrossed the popular\r\nattention. The main body of the British electors were thinking mainly of\r\npromised agrarian booms, fair trade, the church in danger, or some other\r\nof their own domestic affairs.\r\n\r\nFew forms of literature or history are so dull as the narrative of\r\npolitical debates. With a few exceptions, a political speech like the\r\nmanna in the wilderness loses its savour on the second day. Three or four\r\nmarked utterances of this critical autumn, following all that has been set\r\nforth already, will enable the reader to understand the division of\r\ncounsel that prevailed immediately before the great change of policy in\r\n1886, and the various strategic evolutions, masked movements, and play of\r\nmine, sap, and countermine, that led to it. As has just been described,\r\nand with good reason, (M89) for he believed that he had the Irish viceroy\r\non his side, Mr. Parnell stood inflexible. In his speech of August 24\r\nalready mentioned, he had thrown down his gauntlet.\r\n\r\nMuch the most important answer to the challenge, if we regard the effect\r\nupon subsequent events, was that of Lord Salisbury two months later. To\r\nthis I shall have to return. The two liberal statesmen, Lord Hartington\r\nand Mr. Chamberlain, who were most active in this campaign, and whose\r\nactivity was well spiced and salted by a lively political antagonism,\r\nagreed in a tolerably stiff negative to the Irish demand. The whig leader\r\nwith a slow mind, and the radical leader with a quick mind, on this single\r\nissue of the campaign spoke with one voice. The whig leader(149) thought\r\nMr. Parnell had made a mistake and ensured his own defeat: he\r\noverestimated his power in Ireland and his power in parliament; the Irish\r\nwould not for the sake of this impossible and impracticable undertaking,\r\nforego without duress all the other objects which parliament was ready to\r\ngrant them; and it remained to be seen whether he could enforce his iron\r\ndiscipline upon his eighty or ninety adherents, even if Ireland gave him\r\nso many.\r\n\r\nThe radical leader was hardly less emphatic, and his utterance was the\r\nmore interesting of the two, because until this time Mr. Chamberlain had\r\nbeen generally taken throughout his parliamentary career as leaning\r\nstrongly in the nationalist direction. He had taken a bold and energetic\r\npart in the proceedings that ended in the release of Mr. Parnell from\r\nKilmainham. He had with much difficulty been persuaded to acquiesce in the\r\nrenewal of any part of the Coercion Act, and had absented himself from the\r\nbanquet in honour of Lord Spencer. Together with his most intimate ally in\r\nthe late government, he had projected a political tour in Ireland with Mr.\r\nParnell’s approval and under his auspices. Above all, he had actually\r\nopened his electoral campaign with that famous declaration which was so\r\nlong remembered: “The pacification of Ireland at this moment depends, I\r\nbelieve, on the concession to Ireland of the right to govern itself in the\r\nmatter of its purely domestic business. Is it not discreditable to us that\r\neven now it is only by unconstitutional means that we are able to secure\r\npeace and order in one portion of her Majesty’s dominions? It is a system\r\nas completely centralised and bureaucratic as that with which Russia\r\ngoverns Poland, or as that which prevailed in Venice under the Austrian\r\nrule. An Irishman at this moment cannot move a step—he cannot lift a\r\nfinger in any parochial, municipal, or educational work, without being\r\nconfronted with, interfered with, controlled by, an English official,\r\nappointed by a foreign government, and without a shade or shadow of\r\nrepresentative authority. I say the time has come to reform altogether the\r\nabsurd and irritating anachronism which is known as Dublin Castle. That is\r\nthe work to which the new parliament will be called.”(150) Masters of\r\nincisive speech must pay the price of their gifts, and the sentence about\r\nPoland and Venice was long a favourite in many a debate. But when the\r\nIrish leader now made his proposal for removing the Russian yoke and the\r\nAustrian yoke from Ireland, the English leader drew back. “If these,” he\r\nsaid, “are the terms on which Mr. Parnell’s support is to be obtained, I\r\nwill not enter into the compact.” This was Mr. Chamberlain’s\r\nresponse.(151)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe language used by Mr. Gladstone during this eventful time was that of a\r\nstatesman conscious of the magnitude of the issue, impressed by the\r\nobscurity of the path along which parties and leaders were travelling, and\r\nkeenly alive to the perils of a premature or unwary step. Nothing was\r\neasier for the moment either for quick minds or slow minds, than to face\r\nthe Irish demand beforehand with a bare, blank, wooden _non possumus_. Mr.\r\nGladstone had pondered the matter more deeply. His gift of political\r\nimagination, his wider experience, and his personal share in some chapters\r\nof the modern history of Europe and its changes, planted him on a height\r\nwhence he commanded a view of possibilities (M90) and necessities, of\r\nhopes and of risks, that were unseen by politicians of the beaten track.\r\nLike a pilot amid wandering icebergs, or in waters where familiar buoys\r\nhad been taken up and immemorial beacons put out, he scanned the scene\r\nwith keen eyes and a glass sweeping the horizon in every direction. No\r\nwonder that his words seemed vague, and vague they undoubtedly were.\r\nSuppose that Cavour had been obliged to issue an election address on the\r\neve of the interview at Plombières, or Bismarck while he was on his visit\r\nto Biarritz. Their language would hardly have been pellucid. This was no\r\nmoment for ultimatums. There were too many unascertained elements. Yet\r\nsome of those, for instance, who most ardently admired President Lincoln\r\nfor the caution with which he advanced step by step to the abolition\r\nproclamation, have most freely censured the English statesman because he\r\ndid not in the autumn of 1885 come out with either a downright Yes or a\r\npoint-blank No. The point-blank is not for all occasions, and only a\r\nsimpleton can think otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn September Mr. Childers—a most capable administrator, a zealous\r\ncolleague, wise in what the world regards as the secondary sort of wisdom,\r\nand the last man to whom one would have looked for a plunge—wrote to Mr.\r\nGladstone to seek his approval of a projected announcement to his\r\nconstituents at Pontefract, which amounted to a tolerably full-fledged\r\nscheme of home rule.(152) In view of the charitable allegation that Mr.\r\nGladstone picked up home rule after the elections had placed it in the\r\npower of the Irish either to put him into office or to keep him out of\r\noffice, his reply to Mr. Childers deserves attention:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Mr. Childers._\r\n\r\n    _Sept. 28, 1885._—I have a decided sympathy with the general scope\r\n    and spirit of your proposed declaration about Ireland. If I offer\r\n    any observations, they are meant to be simply in furtherance of\r\n    your purpose.\r\n\r\n    1. I would disclaim giving any exhaustive list of Imperial\r\n    subjects, and would not “put my foot down” as to revenue, but\r\n    would keep plenty of elbow-room to keep all customs and excise,\r\n    which would probably be found necessary.\r\n\r\n    2. A general disclaimer of particulars as to the form of any local\r\n    legislature might suffice, without giving the Irish expressly to\r\n    know it might be decided mainly by their wish.\r\n\r\n    3. I think there is no doubt Ulster would be able to take care of\r\n    itself in respect to education, but a question arises and forms, I\r\n    think, the most difficult part of the whole subject, whether some\r\n    defensive provisions for the owners of land and property should\r\n    not be considered.\r\n\r\n    4. It is evident you have given the subject much thought, and my\r\n    sympathy goes largely to your details as well as your principle.\r\n    But considering the danger of placing confidence in the leaders of\r\n    the national party at the present moment, and the decided\r\n    disposition they have shown to raise their terms on any favourable\r\n    indication, I would beg you to consider further whether you should\r\n    _bind_ yourself at present to any details, or go beyond general\r\n    indications. If you say in terms (and this I do not dissuade) that\r\n    you are ready to consider the question whether they can have a\r\n    legislature for all questions not Imperial, this will be a great\r\n    step in advance; and anything you may say beyond it, I should like\r\n    to see veiled in language not such as to commit you.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader who is now acquainted with Mr. Gladstone’s strong support of\r\nthe Chamberlain plan in 1885, and with the bias already disclosed, knows\r\nin what direction the main current of his thought must have been setting.\r\nThe position taken in 1885 was in entire harmony with all these\r\npremonitory notes. Subject, said Mr. Gladstone, to the supremacy of the\r\ncrown, the unity of the empire, and all the authority of parliament\r\nnecessary for the conservation of that unity, every grant to portions of\r\nthe country of enlarged powers for the management of their own affairs,\r\nwas not a source of danger, but a means of averting it. “As to the\r\nlegislative union, I believe history and posterity will consign to\r\ndisgrace the name and memory of every man, be he who he may, and on\r\nwhichever side of the Channel he may dwell, that having the power to aid\r\nin an equitable settlement between Ireland and Great Britain, shall use\r\nthat power not to aid, but to prevent or retard it.”(153) These and all\r\nthe other large and profuse sentences of the Midlothian address were\r\nundoubtedly open to more than one construction, and they either admitted\r\nor excluded home rule, as might happen. The fact that, though it was\r\nrunning so freely in his own mind, he did not put Irish autonomy into the\r\nforefront of his address, has been made a common article of charge against\r\nhim. As if the view of Irish autonomy now running in his mind were not\r\ndependent on a string of hypotheses. And who can imagine a party leader’s\r\nelection address that should have run thus?—“ If Mr. Parnell returns with\r\na great majority of members, and if the minority is not weighty enough,\r\nand if the demand is constitutionally framed, and if the Parnellites are\r\nunanimous, then we will try home rule. And this possibility of a\r\nhypothetical experiment is to be the liberal cry with which to go into\r\nbattle against Lord Salisbury, who, so far as I can see, is nursing the\r\nidea of the same experiment.”\r\n\r\nSome weeks later, in speaking to his electors in Midlothian, Mr. Gladstone\r\ninstead of minimising magnified the Irish case, pushed it into the very\r\nforefront, not in one speech, but in nearly all; warned his hearers of the\r\ngravity of the questions soon to be raised by it, and assured them that it\r\nwould probably throw into the shade the other measures that he had\r\ndescribed as ripe for action. He elaborated a declaration, of which much\r\nwas heard for many months and years afterwards. What Ireland, he said, may\r\ndeliberately and constitutionally demand, unless it infringes the\r\nprinciples connected with the honourable maintenance of the unity of the\r\nempire, will be a demand that we are bound at any rate to treat with\r\ncareful attention. To stint Ireland in power which might be necessary or\r\ndesirable for the management of matters purely Irish, would be a great\r\nerror; and if she was so stinted, the end that any such measure might\r\ncontemplate could not be attained. Then came the memorable appeal: “Apart\r\nfrom the term of whig and tory, there is one thing I will say and will\r\nendeavour to impress upon you, and it is this. It will be a vital danger\r\nto the country and to the empire, if at a time when a demand from Ireland\r\nfor larger powers of self-government is to be dealt with, there is not in\r\nparliament a party totally independent of the Irish vote.”(154) Loud and\r\nlong sustained have been the reverberations of this clanging sentence. It\r\nwas no mere passing dictum. Mr. Gladstone himself insisted upon the same\r\nposition again and again, that “for a government in a minority to deal\r\nwith the Irish question would not be safe.” This view, propounded in his\r\nfirst speech, was expanded in his second. There he deliberately set out\r\nthat the urgent expediency of a liberal majority independent of Ireland\r\ndid not foreshadow the advent of a liberal government to power. He\r\nreferred to the settlement of household suffrage in 1867. How was the tory\r\ngovernment enabled to effect that settlement? Because there was in the\r\nHouse a liberal majority which did not care to eject the existing\r\nministry.(155) He had already reminded his electors that tory governments\r\nwere sometimes able to carry important measures, when once they had made\r\nup their minds to it, with greater facility than liberal governments\r\ncould. For instance, if Peel had not been the person to propose the repeal\r\nof the corn laws, Lord John would not have had fair consideration from the\r\ntories; and no liberal government could have carried the Maynooth\r\nAct.(156)\r\n\r\nThe plain English of the abundant references to Ireland in the Midlothian\r\nspeeches of this election is, that Mr. Gladstone foresaw beyond all shadow\r\nof doubt that the Irish question in its largest extent would at once\r\ndemand the instant attention of the new parliament; that the best hope of\r\nsettling it would be that the liberals should have a majority of their\r\nown; that the second best hope lay in its settlement by the tory\r\ngovernment with the aid of the liberals; but that, in any case, the worst\r\nof all conditions under which a settlement could be attempted—an attempt\r\nthat could not be avoided—would be a situation in which Mr. Parnell should\r\nhold the balance between parliamentary parties.\r\n\r\nThe precise state of Mr. Gladstone’s mind at this moment is best shown in\r\na very remarkable letter written by him to Lord Rosebery, under whose roof\r\nat Talmeny he was staying at the time:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Lord Rosebery._\r\n\r\n    _Dalmeny Park, 13th Nov. 1885._—You have called my attention to\r\n    the recent speech of Mr. Parnell, in which he expresses the desire\r\n    that I should frame a plan for giving to Ireland, without\r\n    prejudice to imperial unity and interests, the management of her\r\n    own affairs. The subject is so important that, though we are\r\n    together, I will put on paper my view of this proposal. For the\r\n    moment I assume that such a plan can be framed. Indeed, if I had\r\n    considered this to be hopeless, I should have been guilty of great\r\n    rashness in speaking of it as a contingency that should be kept in\r\n    view at the present election. I will first give reasons, which I\r\n    deem to be of great weight, against my producing a scheme,\r\n    reserving to the close one reason, which would be conclusive in\r\n    the absence of every other reason.\r\n\r\n    1. It is not the province of the person leading the party in\r\n    opposition, to frame and produce before the public detailed\r\n    schemes of such a class.\r\n\r\n    2. There are reasons of great weight, which make it desirable that\r\n    the party now in power should, if prepared to adopt the principle,\r\n    and if supported by an adequate proportion of the coming House of\r\n    Commons, undertake the construction and proposal of the measure.\r\n\r\n    3. The unfriendly relations between the party of nationalists and\r\n    the late government in the expiring parliament, have of necessity\r\n    left me and those with whom I act in great ignorance of the\r\n    interior mind of the party, which has in parliament systematically\r\n    confined itself to very general declarations.\r\n\r\n    4. That the principle and basis of an admissible measure have been\r\n    clearly declared by myself, if not by others, before the country;\r\n    more clearly, I think, than was done in the case of the Irish\r\n    disestablishment; and that the particulars of such plans in all\r\n    cases have been, and probably must be, left to the discretion of\r\n    the legislature acting under the usual checks.\r\n\r\n    But my final and paramount reason is, that the production at this\r\n    time of a plan by me would not only be injurious, but would\r\n    destroy all reasonable hope of its adoption. Such a plan, proposed\r\n    by the heads of the liberal party, is so certain to have the\r\n    opposition of the tories _en bloc_, that every computation must be\r\n    founded on this anticipation. This opposition, and the appeals\r\n    with which it will be accompanied, will render the carrying of the\r\n    measure difficult even by a united liberal party; hopeless or most\r\n    difficult, should there be serious defection.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Parnell is apprehensive of the opposition of the House of\r\n    Lords. That idea weighs little with me. I have to think of\r\n    something nearer, and more formidable. The idea of constituting a\r\n    legislature for Ireland, whenever seriously and responsibly\r\n    proposed, will cause a mighty heave in the body politic. It will\r\n    be as difficult to carry the liberal party and the two British\r\n    nations in favour of a legislature for Ireland, as it was easy to\r\n    carry them in the case of Irish disestablishment. I think that it\r\n    may possibly be done; but only by the full use of a great\r\n    leverage. That leverage can only be found in their equitable and\r\n    mature consideration of what is due to the fixed desire of a\r\n    nation, clearly and constitutionally expressed. Their\r\n    prepossessions will not be altogether favourable; and they cannot\r\n    in this matter be bullied.\r\n\r\n    I have therefore endeavoured to lay the ground by stating largely\r\n    the possibility and the gravity, even the solemnity, of that\r\n    demand. I am convinced that this is the only path which can lead\r\n    to success. With such a weapon, one might go hopefully into\r\n    action. But I well know, from a thousand indications past and\r\n    present, that a new project of mine launched into the air, would\r\n    have no _momentum_ which could carry it to its aim. So, in my\r\n    mind, stands the case....\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days before this letter, Mr. Gladstone had replied to one from Lord\r\nHartington:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Lord Hartington._\r\n\r\n    _Dalmeny, Nov. 10, 1885._—I made a beginning yesterday in one of\r\n    my conversation speeches, so to call them, on the way, by laying\r\n    it down that I was particularly bound to prevent, if I could, the\r\n    domination of sectional opinion over the body and action of the\r\n    party.\r\n\r\n    I wish to say something about the modern radicalism. But I must\r\n    include this, that if it is rampant and ambitious, the two most\r\n    prominent causes of its forwardness have been: 1. Tory democracy.\r\n    2. The gradual disintegration of the liberal aristocracy. On both\r\n    these subjects my opinions are strong. I think the conduct of the\r\n    Duke of Bedford and others has been as unjustifiable as it was\r\n    foolish, especially after what we did to save the House of Lords\r\n    from itself in the business of the franchise.\r\n\r\n    Nor can I deny that the question of the House of Lords, of the\r\n    church, or both, will probably split the liberal party. But let it\r\n    split decently, honourably, and for cause. That it should split\r\n    now would, so far as I see, be ludicrous.\r\n\r\n    So far I have been writing in great sympathy with you, but now I\r\n    touch a point where our lines have not been the same. You have, I\r\n    think, courted the hostility of Parnell. Salisbury has carefully\r\n    avoided doing this, and last night he simply confined himself to\r\n    two conditions, which you and I both think vital; namely, the\r\n    unity of the empire and an honourable regard to the position of\r\n    the “minority,” _i.e._ the landlords. You will see in the\r\n    newspapers what Parnell, _making_ for himself an opportunity, is\r\n    reported to have said about the elections in Ulster now at hand.\r\n    You have opened a vista which appears to terminate in a possible\r\n    concession to Ireland of full power to manage her own local\r\n    affairs. But I own my leaning to the opinion that, if that\r\n    consummation is in any way to be contemplated, action at a stroke\r\n    will be more honourable, less unsafe, less uneasy, than the\r\n    jolting process of a series of partial measures. This is my\r\n    opinion, but I have no intention, as at present advised, of\r\n    signifying it. I have all along in public declarations avoided\r\n    offering anything to the nationalists, beyond describing the\r\n    limiting rule which must govern the question. It is for them to\r\n    ask, and for us, as I think, to leave the space so defined as open\r\n    and unencumbered as possible. I am much struck by the increased\r\n    breadth of Salisbury’s declaration last night; he dropped the “I\r\n    do not see how.”\r\n\r\n    We shall see how these great and difficult matters develop\r\n    themselves. Meantime be assured that, with a good deal of\r\n    misgiving as to the future, I shall do what little I can towards\r\n    enabling all liberals at present to hold together with credit and\r\n    good conscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone’s cardinal deliverance in November had been preceded by an\r\nimportant event. On October 7, 1885, Lord Salisbury made that speech at\r\nNewport, which is one of the tallest and most striking landmarks in the\r\nshifting sands of this controversy. It must be taken in relation to Lord\r\nCarnarvon’s declaration of policy on taking office, and to his exchange of\r\nviews with Mr. Parnell at the end of July. Their first principle, said\r\nLord Salisbury, was to extend to Ireland, so far as they could, all the\r\ninstitutions of this country. But one must remember that in Ireland the\r\npopulation is on several subjects deeply divided, and a government is\r\nbound ’on all matters of essential justice’ to protect a minority against\r\na majority. Then came remarkable sentences: “Local authorities are more\r\nexposed to the temptation of enabling the majority to be unjust to the\r\nminority when they obtain jurisdiction over a small area, than is the case\r\nwhen the authority derives its sanction and extends its jurisdiction over\r\na wider area. In a large central authority, the wisdom of several parts of\r\nthe country will correct the folly and mistakes of one. In a local\r\nauthority, that correction is to a much greater extent wanting, and it\r\nwould be impossible to leave that out of sight, in any extension of any\r\nsuch local authority in Ireland.” This principle was often used in the\r\nlater controversy as a recognition by Lord Salisbury that the creation of\r\na great central body would be a safer policy than the mere extension of\r\nself-government in Irish counties. In another part of the speech, it is\r\ntrue, the finger-post or weather-vane pointed in the opposite direction.\r\n“With respect to the larger organic questions connected with Ireland,”\r\nsaid Lord Salisbury, “I cannot say much, though I can speak emphatically.\r\nI have nothing to say but that the traditions of the party to which we\r\nbelong, are on this point clear and distinct, and you may rely upon it our\r\nparty will not depart from them.” Yet this emphatic refusal to depart from\r\nthe traditions of the tory party did not prevent Lord Salisbury from\r\nretaining at that moment in his cabinet an Irish viceroy, with whom he\r\n(M91) was in close personal relations, and whose active Irish policy he\r\nmust have known to be as wide a breach in tory tradition as the mind of\r\nman can imagine. So hard is it in distracted times, the reader may\r\nreflect, even for men of honourable and lofty motive to be perfectly\r\ningenuous.\r\n\r\nThe speaker next referred to the marked way in which Mr. Parnell, a day or\r\ntwo before, had mentioned the position of Austro-Hungary. “I gathered that\r\nsome notion of imperial federation was floating in his mind. With respect\r\nto Ireland, I am bound to say that I have never seen any plan or any\r\nsuggestion which gives me at present the slightest ground for anticipating\r\nthat it is in that direction that we shall find any substantial solution\r\nof the difficulties of the problem.” In an electric state of the political\r\natmosphere, a statesman who said that at present he did not think federal\r\nhome rule possible, was taken to imply that he might think it possible,\r\nby-and-by. No door was closed.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, Lord Salisbury’s language upon social order that gave\r\nmost scandal to simple consciences in his own ranks. You ask us, he said,\r\nwhy we did not renew the Crimes Act. There are two answers: we could not,\r\nand it would have done no good if we could. To follow the extension of the\r\nfranchise by coercion, would have been a gross inconsistency. To show\r\nconfidence by one act, and the absence of confidence by a simultaneous\r\nact, would be to stultify parliament. Your inconsistency would have\r\nprovoked such intense exasperation, that it would have led to ten times\r\nmore evil, ten times more resistance to the law, than your Crimes Act\r\ncould possibly have availed to check. Then the audience was favoured with\r\na philosophic view of boycotting. This, said the minister, is an offence\r\nwhich legislation has very great difficulty in reaching. The provisions of\r\nthe Crimes Act against it had a very small effect. It grew up under that\r\nAct. And, after all, look at boycotting. An unpopular man or his family go\r\nto mass. The congregation with one accord get up and walk out. Are you\r\ngoing to indict people for leaving church? The plain fact is that\r\nboycotting “is more like the excommunication or interdict of the middle\r\nages, than anything that we know now.” “The truth about boycotting is that\r\nit depends on the passing humour of the population.”\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that in the month immediately preceding this\r\npolished apologetic, there were delivered some of the most violent\r\nboycotting speeches ever made in Ireland.(157) These speeches must have\r\nbeen known to the Irish government, and their occurrence and the purport\r\nof them must presumably have been known therefore to the prime minister.\r\nHere was indeed a removal of the ancient buoys and beacons that had\r\nhitherto guided English navigation in Irish waters. There was even less of\r\na solid ultimatum at Newport, than in those utterances in Midlothian which\r\nwere at that time and long afterwards found so culpably vague, blind, and\r\nelusive. Some of the more astute of the minister’s own colleagues were\r\ndelighted with his speech, as keeping the Irishmen steady to the tory\r\nparty. They began to hope that they might even come within five-and-twenty\r\nof the liberals when the polling began.\r\n\r\nThe question on which side the Irish vote in Great Britain should be\r\nthrown seems not to have been decided until after Mr. Gladstone’s speech.\r\nIt was then speedily settled. On Nov. 21 a manifesto was issued, handing\r\nover the Irish vote in Great Britain solid to the orator of the Newport\r\nspeech. The tactics were obvious. It was Mr. Parnell’s interest to bring\r\nthe two contending British parties as near as might be to a level, and\r\nthis he could only hope to do by throwing his strength upon the weaker\r\nside. It was from the weaker side, if they could be retained in office,\r\nthat he would get the best terms.(158) The document was composed with\r\nvigour and astuteness. But the phrases of the manifesto were the least\r\nimportant part of it. It was enough that the hard word was passed. Some\r\nestimated the loss to the liberal party in this island at twenty seats,\r\nothers at forty. Whether twenty or forty, these lost seats made a fatal\r\ndifference in the division on the Irish bill a few months later, and when\r\n(M92) that day had come and gone, Mr. Parnell sometimes ruefully asked\r\nhimself whether the tactics of the electoral manifesto were not on the\r\nwhole a mistake. But this was not all and was not the worst of it. The\r\nIrish manifesto became a fiery element in a sharp electioneering war, and\r\nthrew the liberals in all constituencies where there was an Irish vote\r\ninto a direct and angry antagonism to the Irish cause and its leaders;\r\npassions were roused, and things were said about Irishmen that could not\r\nat once be forgotten; and the great task of conversion in 1886, difficult\r\nin any case, was made a thousand times more difficult still by the\r\narguments and antipathies of the electoral battle of 1885. Meanwhile it\r\nwas for the moment, and for the purposes of the moment, a striking\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II. The Polls In 1885. (1885)\r\n\r\n\r\n    I would say that civil liberty can have no security without\r\n    political power.—C. J. FOX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe election ran a chequered course (Nov. 23-Dec. 19). It was the first\r\ntrial of the whole body of male householders, and it was the first trial\r\nof the system of single-member districts. This is not the place for a\r\ndiscussion of the change of electoral area. As a scheme for securing\r\nrepresentation of minorities it proved of little efficacy, and many\r\nbelieve that the substitution of a smaller constituency for a larger one\r\nhas tended to slacken political interest, and to narrow political\r\njudgment. Meanwhile some of those who were most deeply concerned in\r\nestablishing the new plan, were confident that an overwhelming liberal\r\ntriumph would be the result. Many of their opponents took the same view,\r\nand were in despair. A liberal met a tory minister on the steps of a club\r\nin Pall Mall, as they were both going to the country for their elections.\r\n“I suppose,” said the tory, “we are out for twenty years to come.” _O\r\npectora cæca!_ He has been in office for nearly fifteen of the eighteen\r\nyears since. In September one of the most authoritative liberal experts\r\ndid not see how the tories were to have more than 210 out of the 670\r\nseats, including the tory contingent from Ireland. Two months later the\r\nexpert admitted that the tory chances were improving, mainly owing to what\r\nin electioneering slang was called the church scare. Fair trade, too, had\r\nmade many converts in Lancashire. On the very eve of the polls the\r\nestimate at liberal headquarters was a majority of forty over tories and\r\nIrishmen combined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n(M93) As I should have told the reader on an earlier page, Mr. Gladstone\r\nhad proceeded to his own constituency on November 9. The previous month\r\nhad found, as usual, endless other interests to occupy him, quite apart\r\nfrom politics. These are the ordinary entries. “Worked, say, five hours on\r\nbooks. Three more hours reduced my books and rooms to apparent order, but\r\nmuch detail remains. Worked mildly on books.” In this region he would have\r\nsaid of disorder and disarray what Carlyle said to dirt, “Thou shalt not\r\nabide with me.” As to the insides of books, his reading was miscellaneous:\r\nMadame d’Arblay, Bodley’s _Remains_, Bachaumont’s _Anecdotes_, Cuvier’s\r\n_Theory of the Earth_, Whewell on _Astronomy_, the _Life of B. Gilpin_,\r\nHennell’s _Inquiry_, Schmidt’s _Social Effects of Christianity_, Miss\r\nMartineau’s _Autobiography_, Anderson on _Glory of the Bible,_ Barrow’s\r\n_Towards the Truth_, and so on—many of the books now stone-dead. Besides\r\nsuch reading as this, he “made a beginning of a paper on Hermes, and read\r\nfor it,” and worked hard at a controversial article, in reply to M.\r\nRéville, upon the Dawn of Creation and Worship. When he corrected the\r\nproof, he found it ill-written, and in truth we may rather marvel at, than\r\nadmire, the hardihood that handled such themes amid such\r\ndistractions.(159) Much company arrived. “Count Münster came to luncheon;\r\nlong walk and talk with him. The Derby-Bedford party came and went. I had\r\nan hour’s good conversation with Lord D. Tea in the open air. _Oct.\r\n7._—Mr. Chamberlain came. Well, and much conversation. _Oct. 8._—Mr.\r\nChamberlain. Three hours of conversation.”\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the month the doctors reported excellently of the\r\ncondition of his vocal cords, and when he started for Dalmeny and the\r\nscene of the exploits of 1880 once more, he was in spirits to enjoy “an\r\nanimated journey,” and the vast enthusiasm with which Edinburgh again\r\nreceived him. His speeches were marked by undiminished fire. He boldly\r\nchallenged a verdict on policy in the Soudan, while freely admitting that\r\nin some points, not immaterial, his cabinet had fallen into error, though\r\nin every case the error was fostered by the party opposite; and he pointed\r\nto the vital fact that though the party opposite were in good time, they\r\nnever dreamed of altering the policy. He asked triumphantly how they would\r\nhave fared in the Afghan dispute, if the policy anterior to 1880 had not\r\nbeen repudiated. In his address he took the same valiant line about South\r\nAfrica. “In the Transvaal,” he said, “we averted a war of European and\r\nChristian races throughout South African states, which would have been\r\nalike menacing to our power, and scandalous in the face of civilisation\r\nand of Christendom. As this has been with our opponents a favourite\r\nsubject of unmeasured denunciation, so I for one hail and reciprocate\r\ntheir challenge, and I hope the nation will give a clear judgment on our\r\nrefusal to put down liberty by force, and on the measures that have\r\nbrought about the present tranquillity of South Africa.” His first speech\r\nwas on Ireland, and Ireland figured, as we have seen, largely and\r\nemphatically to the last. Disestablishment was his thorniest topic, for\r\nthe scare of the church in danger was working considerable havoc in\r\nEngland, and every word on Scottish establishment was sure to be\r\ntranslated to establishment elsewhere. On the day on which he was to\r\nhandle it, his entry is: “Much rumination, and made notes which in\r\nspeaking I could not manage to see. Off to Edinburgh at 2.30. Back at 6.\r\nSpoke seventy minutes in Free Kirk Hall: a difficult subject. The present\r\nagitation does not strengthen in my mind the principle of establishment.”\r\nHis leading text was a favourite and a salutary maxim of his, that “it is\r\na very serious responsibility to take political questions out of their\r\nproper time and their proper order,” and the summary of his speech was\r\nthat the party was agreed upon certain large and complicated questions,\r\nsuch as were enough for one parliament to settle, and that it would be an\r\nerror to attempt to thrust those questions aside, to cast them into the\r\nshade and the darkness, “for the sake of a subject of which I will not\r\nundervalue the importance, but of which I utterly deny the maturity at the\r\npresent moment.”(160)\r\n\r\nOn Nov. 27 the poll was taken; 11,241 electors out of 12,924, or 87 per\r\ncent., recorded their votes, and of these 7879 voted for Mr. Gladstone,\r\nand 3248 for Mr. Dalrymple, or a majority of 4631. So little impression\r\nhad been made (M94) in Midlothian by Kilmainham, Majuba, Khartoum,\r\nPenjdeh, and the other party cries of a later period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us turn to the general result, and the final composition of Mr.\r\nGladstone’s thirteenth parliament. The polls of the first three or four\r\ndays were startling. It looked, in the phrases of the time, as if there\r\nwere conservative reaction all round, as if the pendulum had swung back to\r\nthe point of tory triumph in 1874, and as if early reverses would wind up\r\nin final rout. Where the tories did not capture the seat, their numbers\r\nrose and the liberal majorities fell. At the end of four days the liberals\r\nin England and Wales had scored 86 against 109 for their adversaries. When\r\ntwo-thirds of the House had been elected, the liberals counted 196, the\r\ntories 179, and the Irish nationalists 37. In spite of the early panic or\r\nexultation, it was found that in boroughs of over 100,000 the liberals had\r\nafter all carried seventeen, against eight for their opponents. But the\r\ntories were victorious in a solid Liverpool, save one Irish seat; they won\r\nall the seats in Manchester save one; and in London, where liberals had\r\nbeen told by those who were believed to know, that they would make a clean\r\nsweep, there were thirty-six tories against twenty-six liberals. Two\r\nmembers of the late liberal cabinet and three subordinate ministers were\r\nthrown out. “The verdict of the English borough constituencies,” cried the\r\n_Times_, “will be recorded more emphatically than was even the case in\r\n1874 in favour of the conservatives. The opposition have to thank Mr.\r\nChamberlain not only for their defeat at the polls, but for the\r\nirremediable disruption and hopeless disorganisation of the liberal party\r\nwith its high historic past and its high claims to national gratitude. His\r\nachievement may give him such immortality as was won by the man who burned\r\ndown the temple of Diana at Ephesus.”(161) The same writers have ever\r\nsince ascribed the irremediable disruption to Mr. Gladstone and the Irish\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nNow came the counties with their newly enfranchised hosts. Here the tide\r\nflowed strong and steady. Squire and parson were amazed to see the\r\nlabourer, of whose stagnant indifference to politics they had been so\r\nconfident, trudging four or five miles to a political meeting, listening\r\nwithout asking for a glass of beer to political speeches, following point\r\nupon-point, and then trudging back again dumbly chewing the cud.\r\nPoliticians with gifts of rhetoric began to talk of the grand revolt of\r\nthe peasants, and declared that it was the most remarkable transformation\r\nsince the conversion of the Franks. Turned into prose, this meant that the\r\nliberals had extended their area into large rural provinces where hitherto\r\ntory supremacy had never been disputed. Whether or no Mr. Chamberlain had\r\nbroken the party in the boroughs, his agrarian policy together with the\r\nnatural uprising of the labourer against the party of squire and farmer,\r\nhad saved it in the counties. The nominees of such territorial magnates as\r\nthe Northumberlands, the Pembrokes, the Baths, the Bradfords, the Watkin\r\nWynns, were all routed, and the shock to territorial influence was felt to\r\nbe profound. An ardent agrarian reformer, who later became a conspicuous\r\nunionist, writing to Mr. Gladstone in July a description of a number of\r\ngreat rural gatherings, told him, “One universal feature of these meetings\r\nis the joy, affection, and unbounded applause with which your name is\r\nreceived by these earnest men. Never in all your history had you so strong\r\na place in the hearts of the common people, as you have to-day. It\r\nrequires to be seen to be realised.”\r\n\r\nAll was at last over. It then appeared that so far from there being a\r\nsecond version of the great tory reaction of 1874, the liberals had now in\r\nthe new parliament a majority over tories of 82, or thirty under the\r\ncorresponding majority in the year of marvel, 1880. In great Britain they\r\nhad a majority of 100, being 333 against 233.(162) But (M95) they had no\r\nmajority over tories and Irishmen combined. That hopeful dream had glided\r\naway through the ivory gate.\r\n\r\nShots between right wing and left of the liberal party were exchanged to\r\nthe very last moment. When the borough elections were over, the Birmingham\r\nleader cried that so far from the loss in the boroughs being all the fault\r\nof the extreme liberals, it was just because the election had not been\r\nfought on their programme, but was fought instead on a manifesto that did\r\nnot include one of the points to which the extreme liberals attached the\r\ngreatest importance. For the sake of unity, they had put aside their most\r\ncherished principles, disestablishment for instance, and this, forsooth,\r\nwas the result.(163) The retort came as quickly as thunder after the\r\nflash. Lord Hartington promptly protested from Matlock, that the very\r\ncrisis of the electoral conflict was an ill-chosen moment for the public\r\nexpression of doubt by a prominent liberal as to the wisdom of a policy\r\naccepted by the party, and announced by the acknowledged leader of the\r\nwhole party. When the party had found some more tried, more trusted, more\r\nworthy leader, then might perhaps be the time to impugn the policy. These\r\nreproachful ironies of Lord Hartington boded ill for any prospect of the\r\nheroes of this fratricidal war of the platform smoothing their wrinkled\r\nfronts in a liberal cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Ireland the result shed a strong light on the debating prophecies that\r\nthe extension of the county franchise would not be unfavourable to the\r\nlandlord interest; that it would enable the deep conservative interest of\r\nthe peasantry to vindicate itself against the nationalism of the towns;\r\nthat it would prove beyond all doubt that the Irish leader did not really\r\nspeak the mind of a decided majority of the people of Ireland. Relying on\r\nthe accuracy of these abstract predictions, the Irish tories started\r\ncandidates all over the country. Even some of them who passed for shrewd\r\nand candid actually persuaded themselves that they were making an\r\nimpression on the constituencies. The effect of their ingenuous operations\r\nwas to furnish such a measure of nationalist strength, as would otherwise\r\nhave seemed incredible almost to the nationalists themselves. An instance\r\nor two will suffice. In two divisions of Cork, the tories polled 300 votes\r\nagainst nearly 10,000 for the nationalists. In two divisions of Mayo, the\r\ntories polled 200 votes against nearly 10,000 for the nationalists. In one\r\ndivision of Kilkenny there were 4000 nationalist votes against 170 for the\r\ntory, and in another division 4000 against 220. In a division of Kerry the\r\nnationalist had over 3000 votes against 30 for the tory,—a hundred to one.\r\nIn prosperous counties with resident landlords and a good class of gentry\r\nsuch as Carlow and Kildare, in one case the popular vote was 4800 against\r\n750, and in the other 3169 against 467. In some fifty constituencies the\r\npopular majorities ranged in round numbers from 6500 the highest, to 2400\r\nthe lowest. Besides these constituencies where a contest was so futile,\r\nwere those others in which no contest was even attempted.\r\n\r\nIn Ulster a remarkable thing happened. This favoured province had in the\r\nlast parliament returned nine liberals. Lord Hartington attended a banquet\r\nat Belfast (Nov. 5) just before the election. It was as unlucky an affair\r\nas the feast of Belshazzar. His mission was compared by Orange wits to\r\nthat of the Greek hero who went forth to wrestle with Death for the body\r\nof an old woman. The whole of the liberal candidates in Ulster fell down\r\nas dead men. Orangemen and catholics, the men who cried damnation to King\r\nWilliam and the men who cried “To hell with the Pope,” joined hands\r\nagainst them. In Belfast itself, nationalists were (M96) seen walking to\r\nthe booths with orange cards in their hats to vote for orangemen against\r\nliberals.(164) It is true that the paradox did not last, and that the Pope\r\nand King William were speedily on their old terms again. Within six\r\nmonths, the two parties atoned for this temporary backsliding into\r\nbrotherly love, by one of the most furious and protracted conflagrations\r\nthat ever raged even in the holy places of Belfast. Meanwhile nationalism\r\nhad made its way in the south of the province, partly by hopes of reduced\r\nrents, partly by the energy of the catholic population, who had not tasted\r\npolitical power for two centuries. The adhesion of their bishops to the\r\nnational movement in the Monaghan election had given them the signal three\r\nyears before. Fermanagh, hitherto invariably Orange, now sent two\r\nnationalists. Antrim was the single county out of the thirty-two counties\r\nof Ireland that was solid against home rule, and even in Antrim in one\r\ncontest the nationalist was beaten only by 35 votes.\r\n\r\nNot a single liberal was returned in the whole of Ireland. To the last\r\nparliament she had sent fourteen. They were all out bag and baggage.\r\nUlster now sent eighteen nationalists and seventeen tories. Out of the\r\neighty-nine contests in Ireland, Mr. Parnell’s men won no fewer than\r\neighty-five, and in most of them they won by such overwhelming majorities\r\nas I have described. It was noticed that twenty-two of the persons\r\nelected, or more than one-fourth of the triumphant party, had been put in\r\nprison under the Act of 1881. A species of purge, moreover, had been\r\nperformed. All half-hearted nationalists, the doubters and the faithless,\r\nwere dismissed, and their places taken by men pledged either to obey or\r\nelse go.\r\n\r\nThe British public now found out on what illusions they had for the last\r\nfour years been fed. Those of them who had memories, could recollect how\r\nthe Irish secretary of the day, on the third reading of the first Coercion\r\nbill in 1881, had boldly appealed from the Irish members to the People of\r\nIreland. “He was sure that he could appeal with confidence from gentlemen\r\nsitting below the gangway opposite to their constituents.”(165) They\r\nremembered all the talk about Mr. Parnell and his followers being a mere\r\nhandful of men and not a political party at all, and the rest of it. They\r\nhad now a revelation what a fool’s paradise it had been.\r\n\r\nAs a supreme electoral demonstration, the Irish elections of 1885 have\r\nnever been surpassed in any country. They showed that neither remedial\r\nmeasures nor repressive measures had made even the fleeting shadow of an\r\nimpression on the tenacious sentiment of Ireland, or on the powerful\r\norganisation that embodied and directed it. The Land Act had made no\r\nimpression. The two Coercion Acts had made none. The imperial parliament\r\nhad done its best for five years. Some of the ablest of its ministers had\r\nset zealous and intrepid hands to the task, and this was the end. Whether\r\nyou counted seats or counted votes, the result could not be twisted into\r\nanything but what it was—the vehement protest of one of the three kingdoms\r\nagainst the whole system of its government, and a strenuous demand for its\r\nreconstruction on new foundations.\r\n\r\nEndeavours were made to discredit so startling and unwelcome a result. It\r\nwas called “the carefully prepared verdict of a shamefully packed jury.”\r\nMuch was made of the number of voters who declared themselves illiterate,\r\nsaid to be compelled so to do in order that the priest or other\r\nintimidatory person might see that they voted right. As a matter of fact\r\nthe percentage of illiterate voters answered closely to the percentage of\r\nmales over twenty-one in the census returns, who could neither read nor\r\nwrite. Only two petitions followed the general election, one at Belfast\r\nagainst a nationalist, and the other at Derry against a tory, and in\r\nneither of the two was undue influence or intimidation alleged. The routed\r\ncandidates in Ireland, like the same unlucky species elsewhere, raised the\r\nusual chorus of dolorous explanation. The register, they cried, was in a\r\nshameful condition; the polling stations were too few or too remote; the\r\nloyalists were afraid, and the poll did not represent their real numbers;\r\npeople did not believe that the ballot was really secret; the percentage\r\nof illiterates was monstrous; promises and pledges went for nothing. Such\r\nare ever the too familiar voices of mortified electioneering.\r\n\r\n(M97) There was also the best known of all the conclusive topics from tory\r\nIreland. It was all done, vowed the tories, by the bishops and clergy;\r\nthey were indefatigable; they canvassed at the houses and presided at\r\nmeetings; they exhorted their flocks from the altar, and they drilled them\r\nat the polling-booths. The spiritual screw of the priest and the temporal\r\nscrew of the league—there was the whole secret. Such was the story, and it\r\nwas not wholly devoid of truth; but then what balm, what comfort, had even\r\nthe truth of it for British rulers?\r\n\r\nSome thousands of voters stayed away from the polls. It was ingeniously\r\nexplained that their confidence in British rule had been destroyed by the\r\nCarnarvon surrender; a shopkeeper would not offend his customers for the\r\nsake of a Union Jack that no longer waved triumphant in the breeze. They\r\nwere like the Arab sheikhs at Berber, who, when they found that the\r\nEgyptian pashas were going to evacuate, went over to the Mahdi. The\r\nconventions appointed to select the candidates were denounced as the mere\r\ncreatures of Mr. Parnell, the Grand Elector. As if anything could have\r\nshown a more politic appreciation of the circumstances. There are\r\nsituations that require a dictator, not to impose an opinion, but to\r\nkindle an aspiration; not to shape a demand, but to be the effective organ\r\nof opinion and demand. Now in the Irish view was one of those situations.\r\nIn the last parliament twenty-six seats were held by persons designated\r\nnominal home rulers; in the new parliament, not one. Every new nationalist\r\nmember pledged himself to resign whenever the parliamentary party should\r\ncall upon him. Such an instrument grasped in a hand of iron was\r\nindispensable, first to compel the British government to listen, and\r\nsecond, to satisfy any British government disposed to listen, that in\r\ndealing with Mr. Parnell they were dealing with nationalist Ireland, and\r\nwith a statesman who had the power to make his engagements good. You need\r\ngreater qualities, said Cardinal De Retz, to be a good party leader than\r\nto be emperor of the universe. Ireland is not that portion of the universe\r\nin which this is least true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III. A Critical Month (December 1885)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Whoever has held the post of minister for any considerable time\r\n    can never absolutely, unalterably maintain and carry out his\r\n    original opinions. He finds himself in the presence of situations\r\n    that are not always the same—of life and growth—in connection with\r\n    which he must take one course one day, and then, perhaps, another\r\n    on the next day. I could not always run straight ahead like a\r\n    cannon ball.—BISMARCK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe month of December was passed by Mr. Gladstone at Hawarden, in such\r\ndepth of meditation as it is easy for us to conjecture. The composition of\r\nhis party, the new situation in parliament, the mutual relations of\r\nimportant individuals, the Irish case, his own share in respect of the\r\nIrish case, the strange new departure in Irish policy announced and acted\r\nupon by the subsisting cabinet—from all these points of view it was now\r\nhis business to survey the extraordinary scene. The knot to be unravelled\r\nin 1886 was hardly less entangled than that which engaged the powerful\r\ngenius of Pitt at the opening of the century. Stripped of invidious\r\ninnuendo, the words of Lord Salisbury a few weeks later state with\r\nstrength and truth the problem that now confronted parliament and its\r\nchief men. “Up to the time,” said the tory prime minister, “when Mr.\r\nGladstone took office, be it for good or evil, for many generations\r\nIreland had been governed through the influence and the action of the\r\nlanded gentry. I do not wish to defend that system. There is a good deal\r\nto be said for it, and a good deal to be said against it. What I wish to\r\ninsist upon is, not that that system was good, but that the statesman who\r\nundertook to overthrow it, should have had something to put in its place.\r\nHe utterly destroyed it. By the Land Act of 1870, by the Ballot Act of\r\n1872, by the Land Act of 1881, and last of all by the Reform bill of 1884,\r\nthe power of the landed gentry in Ireland is absolutely shattered; and he\r\nnow stands before the formidable problem of a country deprived of a system\r\nof government under which it had existed for many generations, and\r\nabsolutely without even a sketch of a substitute by which the ordinary\r\nfunctions of law and order can be maintained. Those changes which he\r\nintroduced into the government of Ireland were changes that were admirable\r\nfrom a parliamentary point of view. They were suited to the dominant\r\nhumour of the moment. But they were barren of any institutions by which\r\nthe country could be governed and kept in prosperity for the future.”(166)\r\nThis is a statement of the case that biographer and historian alike should\r\nponder. Particularly should they remember that both parties had renounced\r\ncoercion.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone has publicly explained the working of his mind, and both his\r\nprivate letters at the time, and many a conversation later, attest the\r\nhold which the new aspect, however chimerical it may now seem to those who\r\ndo not take long views, had gained upon him. He could not be blind to the\r\nfact that the action and the language of the tory ministers during the\r\nlast six months had shown an unquestionable readiness to face the new\r\nnecessities of a complex situation with new methods. Why should not a\r\nsolution of the present difficulties be sought in the same co-operation of\r\nparties, that had been as advantageous as it was indispensable in other\r\ncritical occasions of the century? He recalled other leading precedents of\r\nnational crisis. There was the repeal of the Test Act in 1828; catholic\r\nemancipation in 1829; the repeal of the corn law in 1846; the extension of\r\nthe franchise in 1867. In the history of these memorable transactions, Mr.\r\nGladstone perceived it to be extremely doubtful whether any one of these\r\nmeasures, all carried as they were by tory governments, could have become\r\nlaw except under the peculiar conditions which secured for each of them\r\nboth the aid of the liberal vote in the House of Commons, and the\r\nauthority possessed by all tory governments in the House of Lords. What\r\nwas the situation? The ministerial party just reached the figure of two\r\nhundred and fifty-one. Mr. Gladstone had said in the course of the\r\nelection that for a government in a minority to deal with the Irish\r\nquestion would not be safe, such an operation could not but be attended by\r\ndanger; but the tender of his support to Lord Salisbury was a\r\ndemonstration that he thought the operation might still properly be\r\nundertaken.(167)\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Herbert Gladstone._\r\n\r\n    _December 10, 1885._—1. The nationalists have run in political\r\n    alliance with the tories for years; more especially for six\r\n    months; most of all at the close during the elections, when _they_\r\n    have made us 335 (say) against 250 [conservatives] instead of 355\r\n    against 230. This alliance is therefore at its zenith. 2. The\r\n    question of Irish government ought for the highest reasons to be\r\n    settled at once, and settled by the allied forces, (1) because\r\n    they have the government, (2) because their measure will have fair\r\n    play from all, most, or many of us, which a measure of ours would\r\n    not have from the tories. 3. As the allied forces are half the\r\n    House, so that there is not a majority against them, no\r\n    constitutional principle is violated by allowing the present\r\n    cabinet to continue undisturbed for the purpose in view. 4. The\r\n    plan for Ireland ought to be produced by the government of the\r\n    day. Principles may be laid down by others, but not the detailed\r\n    interpretation of them in a measure. I have publicly declared I\r\n    produce no plan until the government has arrived at some issue\r\n    with the Irish, as I hope they will. 5. If the moment ever came\r\n    when a plan had to be considered with a view to production on\r\n    behalf of the liberal party, I do not at present see how such a\r\n    question could be dissociated from another vital question, namely,\r\n    who are to be the government. For a government alone can carry a\r\n    measure, though some outline of essentials might be put out in a\r\n    motion or resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nHappening in these days to meet in the neighbouring (M98) palace of a whig\r\nmagnate, Mr. Balfour, a young but even then an important member of the\r\ngovernment, with whom as a veteran with a junior of high promise he had\r\nlong been on terms of friendly intimacy, Mr. Gladstone began an informal\r\nconversation with him upon the condition of Ireland, on the stir that it\r\nwas making in men’s minds, and on the urgency of the problem. The\r\nconversation he followed up by a letter (Dec. 20). Every post, he said,\r\nbore him testimony to the growing ferment. In urging how great a calamity\r\nit would be if so vast a question should fall into the lines of party\r\nconflict, he expressed his desire to see it taken up by the government,\r\nand to be able, with reserve of necessary freedom, to co-operate in their\r\ndesign. Mr. Balfour replied with courteous scepticism, but promised to\r\ninform Lord Salisbury. The tactical computation was presumably this, that\r\nLord Salisbury would lose the Orange group from Ireland and the extreme\r\ntories in England, but would keep the bulk of his party. On the other\r\nhand, Mr. Gladstone in supporting a moderate home rule would drop some of\r\nthe old whigs and some of the extreme radicals, but he too would keep the\r\nbulk of the liberal party. Therefore, even if Mr. Parnell and his\r\nfollowers should find the scheme too moderate to be endurable, still Lord\r\nSalisbury with Mr. Gladstone’s help would settle the Irish question as\r\nPeel with the help of the whigs settled the question of corn.\r\n\r\nBoth at the time and afterwards Mr. Gladstone was wont to lay great stress\r\nupon the fact that he had opened this suggestion and conveyed this proffer\r\nof support. For instance, he writes to Lord Hartington (Dec. 20): “On\r\nTuesday I had a conversation with Balfour at Eaton, which in conformity\r\nwith my public statements, I think, conveyed informally a hope that they\r\nwould act, as the matter is so serious, and as its becoming a party\r\nquestion would be a great national calamity. I have written to him to say\r\n(without speaking for others) that if they can make a proposal for the\r\npurpose of settling definitely the question of Irish government, I shall\r\nwish with proper reserves to treat it in the spirit in which I have\r\ntreated Afghanistan and the Balkan Peninsula.”\r\n\r\nThe language of Lord Carnarvon when he took office and of Lord Salisbury\r\nat Newport, coupled with the more substantial fact of the alliance between\r\ntories and nationalists before and during the election, no doubt warranted\r\nMr. Gladstone’s assumption that the alliance might continue, and that the\r\ntalk of a new policy had been something more than an electioneering\r\nmanœuvre. Yet the importance that he always attached to his offer of\r\nsupport for a definite settlement, or in plainer English, some sort of\r\nhome rule, implies a certain simplicity. He forgot in his patriotic zeal\r\nthe party system. The tory leader, capable as his public utterances show\r\nof piercing the exigencies of Irish government to the quick, might\r\npossibly, in the course of responsible consultations with opponents for a\r\npatriotic purpose, have been drawn by argument and circumstance on to the\r\nground of Irish autonomy, which he had hitherto considered, and considered\r\nwith apparent favour, only in the dim distance of abstract meditation or\r\nthrough the eyes of Lord Carnarvon. The abstract and intellectual\r\ntemperament is sometimes apt to be dogged and stubborn; on the other hand,\r\nit is often uncommonly elastic. Lord Salisbury’s clear and rationalising\r\nunderstanding might have been expected to carry him to a thoroughgoing\r\nexperiment to get rid of a deep and inveterate disorder. If he thought it\r\npolitic to assent to communication with Mr. Parnell, why should he not\r\nlisten to overtures from Mr. Gladstone? On the other hand, Lord\r\nSalisbury’s hesitation in facing the perils of an Irish settlement in\r\nreliance upon the co-operation of political opponents is far from being\r\nunintelligible. His inferior parliamentary strength would leave him at the\r\nmercy of an extremely formidable ally. He may have anticipated that, apart\r\nfrom the ordinary temptations of every majority to overthrow a minority,\r\nall the strong natural impulses of the liberal leader, his vehement\r\nsympathy with the principle of nationality, the irresistible attraction\r\nfor him of all the grand and eternal commonplaces of liberty and\r\nself-government, would inevitably carry him much further on the Irish road\r\nthan either Lord Salisbury himself may have been disposed to travel, or\r\nthan he could be sure of persuading his party to follow. He may (M99) well\r\nhave seen grounds for pause before committing himself to so delicate and\r\nprecarious an enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in December Lord Granville was at Hawarden, and the two discussed\r\nthe crucial perplexities of the hour, not going further than agreement\r\nthat responsibility lay with the government, and that the best chance for\r\nsettlement lay in large concession. From Hawarden Lord Granville went to\r\nChatsworth, where he found Lord Spencer on his way to visit Mr. Gladstone;\r\nbut nothing important passed among the three leaders thus brought together\r\nunder the roof of Lord Hartington. Lord Granville imparted to Lord Spencer\r\nand Lord Hartington that Mr. Gladstone was full of Ireland in the\r\ndirection of some large concession of self-government. The host discussed\r\nthe thing dispassionately without much expression of opinion. Proceeding\r\nto Hawarden, Lord Spencer was there joined by Lord Rosebery. Their chief\r\nrepeated to them the propositions already stated (p. 258). Mr. Gladstone\r\nwrote to Lord Granville (Dec. 9):\r\n\r\n\r\n    You have, I think, acted very prudently in not returning here. It\r\n    would have been violently canvassed. Your report is as favourable\r\n    as could be expected. I think my conversations with Rosebery and\r\n    Spencer have also been satisfactory. What I expect is a healthful,\r\n    slow fermentation in many minds, working towards the final\r\n    product. It is a case of between the devil and the deep sea. But\r\n    our position is a bed of roses, compared with that of the\r\n    government....\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Spencer was hardly second in weight to Mr. Gladstone himself. His\r\nunrivalled experience of Irish administration, his powers of firm decision\r\nin difficult circumstances, and the impression of high public spirit,\r\nuprightness, and fortitude, which had stamped itself deep upon the public\r\nmind, gave him a force of moral authority in an Irish crisis that was\r\nunique. He knew the importance of a firm and continuous system in Ireland.\r\nSuch a system he had inflexibly carried out. Extreme concessions had been\r\nextorted from him by the radicals in the cabinet, and when the last moment\r\nof the eleventh hour had arrived, it looked as if he would break up the\r\ngovernment by insisting. Then the government was turned out, and the party\r\nof “law and order” came in. He saw his firm and continuous system at the\r\nfirst opportunity flouted and discarded. He was aware, as officials and as\r\nthe public were aware, that his successor at Dublin Castle made little\r\nsecret that he had come over to reverse the policy. Lord Spencer, too,\r\nwell knew in the last months of his reign at Dublin that his own system,\r\nin spite of outward success, had made no mark upon Irish disaffection. It\r\nis no wonder that after his visit to Hawarden, he laboured hard at\r\nconsideration of the problem that the strange action of government on the\r\none hand, and the speculations of a trusted leader on the other, had\r\nforced upon him. On Mr. Gladstone he pressed the question whether a\r\ngeneral support should be given to Irish autonomy as a principle, before\r\nparticulars were matured. In any case he perceived that the difficulty of\r\ngoverning Ireland might well be increased by knowledge of the mere fact\r\nthat Mr. Gladstone and himself, whether in office or in opposition, were\r\nlooking in the direction of autonomy. Somebody said to Mr. Gladstone,\r\npeople talked about his turning Spencer round his thumb. “It would be more\r\ntrue,” he replied, “that he had turned me round his.” That is, I suppose,\r\nby the lessons of Lord Spencer’s experience.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the month Lord Hartington asked Mr. Gladstone for\r\ninformation as to his views and intentions on the Irish question as\r\ndeveloped by the general election. The rumours in the newspapers, he said,\r\nas well as in private letters, were so persistent that it was hard to\r\nbelieve them without foundation. Mr. Gladstone replied to Lord Hartington\r\nin a letter of capital importance in its relation to the prospects of\r\nparty union (Dec. 17):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Lord Hartington._\r\n\r\n    The whole stream of public excitement is now turned upon me, and I\r\n    am pestered with incessant telegrams which I have no defence\r\n    against, but either suicide or Parnell’s method of\r\n    self-concealment. The truth is, I have more or less of opinions\r\n    and ideas, but no intentions or negotiations. In these ideas and\r\n    opinions there is, I think, little that I have not more or less\r\n    conveyed in public declarations; in principle nothing. I will try\r\n    to lay them before you. I consider that Ireland has now spoken;\r\n    and that an effort ought to be made _by the government_ without\r\n    delay to meet her demands for the management by an Irish\r\n    legislative body of Irish as distinct from imperial affairs. Only\r\n    a government can do it, and a tory government can do it more\r\n    easily and safely than any other. There is first a postulate that\r\n    the state of Ireland shall be such as to warrant it. The\r\n    conditions of an admissible plan are—\r\n\r\n    1. Union of the empire and due supremacy of parliament.\r\n\r\n    2. Protection for the minority—a difficult matter on which I have\r\n    talked much with Spencer, certain points, however, remaining to be\r\n    considered.\r\n\r\n    3. Fair allocation of imperial charges.\r\n\r\n    4. A statutory basis seems to me better and safer than the revival\r\n    of Grattan’s parliament, but I wish to hear much more upon this,\r\n    as the minds of men are still in so crude a state on the whole\r\n    subject.\r\n\r\n    5. Neither as opinions nor as instructions have I to any one alive\r\n    promulgated these ideas as decided on by me.\r\n\r\n    6. As to intentions, I am determined to have none at present, to\r\n    leave space to the government—I should wish to encourage them if I\r\n    properly could—above all, on no account to say or do anything\r\n    which would enable the nationalists to establish rival biddings\r\n    between us. If this storm of rumours continues to rage, it may be\r\n    necessary for me to write some new letter to my constituents, but\r\n    I am desirous to do nothing, simply leaving the field open for the\r\n    government until time makes it necessary to decide. Of our late\r\n    colleagues I have had most communication with Granville, Spencer,\r\n    Rosebery. Would you kindly send this on to Granville?\r\n\r\n    I think you will find this in conformity with my public\r\n    declarations, though some blanks are filled up. I have in truth\r\n    thought it my duty without in the least committing myself or any\r\n    one else, to think through the subject as well as I could, being\r\n    equally convinced of its urgency and bigness. If H. and N. are\r\n    with you, pray show them this letter, which is a very hasty one,\r\n    for I am so battered with telegrams that I hardly know whether I\r\n    stand on my head or my heels....\r\n\r\n    With regard to the letter I sent you, my opinion is that there is\r\n    a Parnell party and a separation or civil war party, and the\r\n    question which is to have the upper hand will have to be decided\r\n    in a limited time. My earnest recommendation to everybody is not\r\n    to commit himself. Upon this rule, under whatever pressure, I\r\n    shall act as long as I can. There shall be no private negotiation\r\n    carried on by me, but the time may come when I shall be obliged to\r\n    speak publicly. Meanwhile I hope you will keep in free and full\r\n    communication with old colleagues. Pray put questions if this\r\n    letter seems ambiguous....\r\n\r\n    Pray remember that I am at all times ready for personal\r\n    communication, should you think it desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore receiving this letter, Lord Hartington was startled, as all the\r\nworld was, to come on something in the newspapers that instantly created a\r\nnew situation. Certain prints published on December 17 what was alleged to\r\nbe Mr. Gladstone’s scheme for an Irish settlement.(168) It proposed in\r\nterms the creation of an Irish parliament. Further particulars were given\r\nin detail, but with these we need not concern ourselves. The Irish\r\nparliament was enough. The public mind, bewildered as it was by the\r\nsituation that the curious issue of the election had created, was thrown\r\nby this announcement into extraordinary commotion. The facts are these.\r\nMr. Herbert Gladstone visited London at this time (Dec. 14), partly in\r\nconsequence of a speech made a few days before by Sir C. Dilke, and of the\r\nclub talk which the speech had set going. It was taken to mean that he and\r\nMr. Chamberlain, the two radical leaders, thought that such an Irish\r\npolicy as might be concocted between Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Parnell would\r\nreceive no general support from the liberal party, and that it would be\r\nmuch safer to (M100) leave the tories in power, in the expectation that\r\nsome moderate measures of reform might be got from them, and that\r\nmeanwhile they would become committed with the Irishmen. Tactics of this\r\nkind were equivalent to the exclusion of Mr. Gladstone, for in every\r\nletter that he wrote he pronounced the Irish question urgent. Mr. Herbert\r\nGladstone had not been long in London before the impression became strong\r\nupon him, that in the absence of a guiding hint upon the Irish question,\r\nthe party might be drifting towards a split. Under this impression he had\r\na conversation with the chief of an important press agency, who had\r\npreviously warned him that the party was all at sea. To this gentleman, in\r\nan interview at which no notes were taken and nothing read from papers—so\r\nlittle formal was it—he told his own opinions on the assumed opinions of\r\nMr. Gladstone, all in general terms, and only with the negative view of\r\npreventing friendly writers from falling into traps. Unluckily it would\r\nseem to need at least the genius of a Bismarck, to perform with precision\r\nand success the delicate office of inspiring a modern oracle on the\r\njournalistic tripod. Here, what was intended to be a blameless negative\r\nsoon swelled, as the oracular fumes are wont to do, into a giant positive.\r\nIn conversations with another journalist, who was also his private friend\r\n(Dec. 15), he used language which the friend took to justify the pretty\r\nunreserved announcement that Mr. Gladstone was about to set to work in\r\nearnest on home rule.\r\n\r\n“With all these matters,” Mr. Herbert Gladstone wrote to a near relative\r\nat the time, “my father had no more connection than the man in the moon,\r\nand until each event occurred, he knew no more of it than the man in the\r\nstreet.” Mr. Gladstone on the same day (Dec. 17) told the world by\r\ntelegraph that the statement was not an accurate representation of his\r\nviews, but a speculation upon them; he added that it had not been\r\npublished with his knowledge or authority. There can be no doubt, whatever\r\nelse may be said, that the publication was neither to his advantage, nor\r\nin conformity with his view of the crisis. No statesman in our history has\r\never been more careful of the golden rule of political strategy—to neglect\r\nof which Frederick the Great traced the failure of Joseph II.—not to take\r\nthe second step before you have taken the first. Neither scheme nor\r\nintention had yet crystallised in his mind. Never was there a moment when\r\nevery consideration of political prudence more imperatively counselled\r\nsilence. Mr. Gladstone’s denial of all responsibility was not found to be\r\nan explicit contradiction; it was a repudiation of the two newspapers, but\r\nit was not a repudiation of an Irish parliament. Therefore people believed\r\nthe story the more. Friends and foes became more than ever alert, excited,\r\nalarmed, and in not a few cases vehemently angry. This unauthorised\r\npublication with the qualified denial, placed Mr. Gladstone in the very\r\nposition which he declared that he would not take up; it made him a\r\ntrespasser on ground that belonged to the government. Any action on his\r\npart would in his own view not only be unnecessary; it would be\r\nunwarrantable; it would be in the highest degree injurious and\r\nmischievous.(169) Yet whatever it amounted to, some of this very injury\r\nand mischief followed.\r\n\r\nLord Hartington no sooner saw what was then called the Hawarden kite\r\nflying in the sky, than he felt its full significance. He at once wrote to\r\nMr. Gladstone, partly in reply to the letter of the 17th already given,\r\nand pointed with frankness to what would follow. No other subject would be\r\ndiscussed until the meeting of parliament, and it would be discussed with\r\nthe knowledge, or what would pass for knowledge, that in Mr. Gladstone’s\r\nopinion the time for concession to Ireland had arrived, and that\r\nconcession was practicable. In replying to his former letter Mr. Gladstone\r\nhad invited personal communication, and Lord Hartington thought that he\r\nmight in a few days avail himself of it, though (December 18) he feared\r\nthat little advantage would follow. In spite of urgent arguments from wary\r\nfriends, Lord Hartington at once proceeded to write to his chairman in\r\nLancashire (December 20), informing the public that no proposals of\r\nliberal policy on the Irish demand had been communicated to him; for his\r\nown part he stood to what (M101) he said, at the election. This letter was\r\nthe first bugle note of an inevitable conflict between Mr. Gladstone and\r\nthose who by and by became the whig dissentients.\r\n\r\nTo Lord Hartington resistance to any new Irish policy came easily, alike\r\nby temperament and conviction. Mr. Chamberlain was in a more embarrassing\r\nposition; and his first speech after the election showed it. “We are face\r\nto face,” he said, “with a very remarkable demonstration by the Irish\r\npeople. They have shown that as far as regards the great majority of them,\r\nthey are earnestly in favour of a change in the administration of their\r\ngovernment, and of some system which would give them a larger control of\r\ntheir domestic affairs. Well, we ourselves by our public declarations and\r\nby our liberal principles are pledged to acknowledge the justice of this\r\nclaim.” What was the important point at the moment, Mr. Chamberlain\r\ndeclared that in his judgment the time had hardly arrived when the liberal\r\nparty could interfere safely or with advantage to settle this great\r\nquestion. “Mr. Parnell has appealed to the tories. Let him settle accounts\r\nwith his new friends. Let him test their sincerity and goodwill; and if he\r\nfinds that he has been deceived, he will approach the liberal party in a\r\nspirit of reason and conciliation.”(170)\r\n\r\nTranslated into the language of parliamentary action, this meant that the\r\nliberals, with a majority of eighty-two over the tories, were to leave the\r\ntory minority undisturbed in office, on the chance of their bringing in\r\ngeneral measures of which liberals could approve, and making Irish\r\nproposals to which Mr. Parnell, in the absence of competition for his\r\nsupport, might give at least provisional assent. In principle, these\r\ntactics implied, whether right or wrong, the old-fashioned union of the\r\ntwo British parties against the Irish. Were the two hundred and fifty\r\ntories to be left in power, to carry out all the promises of the general\r\nelection, and fulfil all the hopes of a new parliament chosen on a new\r\nsystem? The Hawarden letter-bag was heavy with remonstrances from newly\r\nelected liberals against any such course.\r\n\r\nSecond only to Mr. Gladstone in experience of stirring and perilous\r\npositions, Lord Granville described the situation to one of his colleagues\r\nas nothing less than “thoroughly appalling.” A great catastrophe, he said,\r\nmight easily result from any of the courses open: from the adoption of\r\ncoercion by either government or opposition; from the adoption by either\r\nof concession; from the attempt to leave the state of Ireland as it was.\r\nIf, as some think, a great catastrophe did in the end result from the\r\ncourse that Mr. Gladstone was now revolving in his own mind at Hawarden,\r\nand that he had commended to the meditations of his most important\r\ncolleagues, what alternative was feasible?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following letters set out the various movements in a drama that was\r\nnow day by day, through much confusion and bewilderment, approaching its\r\nclimax.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    _December 18, ’85._—... Thinking incessantly about the matter,\r\n    speaking freely and not with finality to you, and to Rosebery and\r\n    Spencer—the only colleagues I have seen—I have trusted to writing\r\n    to Hartington (who had had Harcourt and Northbrook with him) and\r\n    to you for Derby.\r\n\r\n    If I have made _any_ step in advance at all, which I am not sure\r\n    of, it has most certainly been in the direction of leaving the\r\n    field open for the government, encouraging them to act, and\r\n    steadily refusing to say or do _anything_ like negotiation on my\r\n    own behalf. So I think Derby will see that in the main I am\r\n    certainly with him.... What will Parnell do? What will the\r\n    government do? How can we decide without knowing or trying to\r\n    know, both if we can, but at any rate the second? This letter is\r\n    at your discretion to use in proper quarters.\r\n\r\n    _December 22._—In the midst of these troubles, I look to you as\r\n    the great feud-composer, and your note just received is just what\r\n    I should have hoped and expected. Hartington wrote to me on\r\n    Saturday that he was going up to see Goschen, but as I thought\r\n    inviting a letter from me, which I wrote [December 17, above], and\r\n    it was with no small surprise that I read him yesterday in the\r\n    _Times_. However, I repeated yesterday to R. Grosvenor all that I\r\n    have said to you about what seems to me the plain duty of the\r\n    _party_, in the event of a severance between nationalists and\r\n    tories. Meantime I care not who knows my anxiety to prevent that\r\n    severance, and for that reason among others to avoid all\r\n    communications of ideas and intentions which could tend to bring\r\n    it about.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn December 27, Lord Granville wrote to Mr. Gladstone at Hawarden:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have been asked to request you to call a cabinet of your late\r\n    colleagues to discuss the present state of affairs. I have\r\n    declined, giving my reasons, which appear to me to be good. At the\r\n    same time, I think it would calm some fussiness that exists, if\r\n    you let it be known to a few that you will be in town and ready\r\n    for consultation, before the actual meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone answered, as those acquainted with his modes of mind might\r\nhave been sure that he would:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _December 28._—Thank you for stopping the request to which your\r\n    letter of yesterday refers. A cabinet does not exist out of\r\n    office, and no one in his senses could covenant to call _the late\r\n    cabinet_ together, I think, even if there were something on which\r\n    it was ready to take counsel, which at this moment there is not.\r\n    On the other hand, you will have seen from my letter that the idea\r\n    before me has been that of going unusual lengths in the way of\r\n    consulting beforehand, not only leading men but the party, or\r\n    undertaking some special obligation to be assured of their\r\n    concurrence generally, before undertaking new responsibilities.\r\n\r\n    The one great difficulty in proceeding to consult now, I think, is\r\n    that we cannot define the situation for ourselves, as an essential\r\n    element of it is the relation between nationalists and tories,\r\n    which they—not we—have to settle. If we meet on Tuesday 12th to\r\n    choose a Speaker, so far as I can learn, regular business will not\r\n    begin before the 19th. By the 12th we shall have given ourselves a\r\n    much better chance of knowing how the two parties stand together;\r\n    and there will be plenty of time for our consultations. Thus at\r\n    least I map out the time; pray give me any comments you think\r\n    required.\r\n\r\n    I begged you to keep Derby informed; would you kindly do the same\r\n    with Harcourt? Rosebery goes to London to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days before this resistance to the request for a meeting, he had\r\nwritten to Lord Granville with an important enclosure:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _December 26, 1885._—I have put down on paper in a memorandum as\r\n    well as I can, the possible forms of the question which may have\r\n    to be decided at the opening of the session. I went over the\r\n    ground in conversation with you, and afterwards with R. Grosvenor,\r\n    and I requested R. Grosvenor, who was going to London, to speak to\r\n    Hartington in that sense. After his recent act of publication, I\r\n    should not like to challenge him by sending him the written paper.\r\n    Please, however, to send it on to Spencer, who will send it back\r\n    to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe memorandum itself must here be quoted, for it sets out in form,\r\nsuccinct, definite, and exhaustive, the situation as Mr. Gladstone at that\r\ntime regarded it:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Secret._ _Hawarden Castle, Chester, Dec. 26, 1885._\r\n\r\n    1. Government should act.\r\n\r\n    2. Nationalists should support them in acting.\r\n\r\n    3. I have done what I can to bring about (1). I am confident the\r\n    nationalists know my desire. They also publicly know there can be\r\n    no plan from me in the present circumstances.\r\n\r\n    4. If (1) and (2) come about, we, who are half the House of\r\n    Commons, may under the circumstances be justified in waiting for\r\n    the production of a plan.\r\n\r\n    5. This would be in every sense the best situation.\r\n\r\n    6. But if ministers refuse to take up the question—or if from\r\n    their not actually taking it up, or on any grounds, the\r\n    nationalists publicly dissolve their alliance with them, the\r\n    government then have a party of 250 in the face of 420, and in the\r\n    face of 335 who were elected to oppose them.\r\n\r\n    7. The basis of our system is that the ministry shall have the\r\n    confidence of the House of Commons. The exception is, when it is\r\n    about to appeal to the people. The rule applies most strongly when\r\n    an election has just taken place. Witness 1835, 1841, 1859, and\r\n    the _three_ last elections, after each of which, the rule has been\r\n    acted upon, silent inference standing instead of a vote.\r\n\r\n    8. The present circumstances warrant, I think, an understanding as\r\n    above, between ministers and the nationalists; but not one between\r\n    us and the nationalists.\r\n\r\n    9. If from any cause the alliance of the tories and nationalists\r\n    which did exist, and presumably does exist, should be known to be\r\n    dissolved, I do not see how it is possible for what would then be\r\n    the liberal majority to shrink from the duty appertaining to it as\r\n    such, and to leave the business of government to the 250 men whom\r\n    it was elected to oppose.\r\n\r\n    10. This looks towards an amendment to the Address, praying her\r\n    Majesty to choose ministers possessed of the confidence of the\r\n    House of Commons.\r\n\r\n    11. Which under the circumstances should, I think, have the\r\n    sanction of a previous meeting of the party.\r\n\r\n    12. An attempt would probably be made to traverse the proceeding\r\n    by drawing me on the Irish question.\r\n\r\n    13. It is impossible to justify the contention that as _a\r\n    condition previous_ to asserting the right and duty of a\r\n    parliamentary majority, the party or the leaders should commit\r\n    themselves on a measure about which they can form no final\r\n    judgment, until by becoming the government they can hold all the\r\n    necessary communications.\r\n\r\n    14. But in all likelihood jealousy will be stronger than logic;\r\n    and to obviate such jealousy, it might be right for me [to go] to\r\n    the very farthest allowable point.\r\n\r\n    15. The case supposed is, the motion made—carried—ministers\r\n    resign—Queen sends for me.\r\n\r\n    Might I go so far as to say at the first meeting that in the case\r\n    supposed, I should only accept the trust if assured of the\r\n    adequate, that is of the general, support of the party to a plan\r\n    of duly guarded home rule?\r\n\r\n    16. If that support were withheld, it would be my duty to stand\r\n    aside.\r\n\r\n    17. In that event it would, I consider, become the duty of that\r\n    portion of the party, which was not prepared to support me in an\r\n    effort to frame a plan of duly guarded home rule, to form a\r\n    government itself if invited by the Queen to do so.\r\n\r\n    18. With me the Irish question would of course remain paramount;\r\n    but preferring a liberal government without an adequate Irish\r\n    measure to a tory government similarly lacking, such a liberal\r\n    government would be entitled to the best general support I could\r\n    give it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reference of this memorandum to Lords Granville and Spencer was\r\nregarded as one of the first informal steps towards a consultation of\r\nleaders. On receiving Lord Spencer’s reply on the point of procedure Mr.\r\nGladstone wrote to him (December 30):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Lord Spencer._\r\n\r\n    I understand your idea to be that inasmuch as leaders of the party\r\n    are likely to be divided on the subject of a bold Irish measure,\r\n    and a divergence might be exhibited in a vote on the Address, it\r\n    may be better to allow the tory government, with 250 supporters in\r\n    a house of 670, to assume the direction of the session and\r\n    continue the administration of imperial affairs. I do not\r\n    undervalue the dangers of the other course. But let us look at\r\n    this one—\r\n\r\n    1. It is an absolute novelty.\r\n\r\n    2. Is it not a novelty which strikes at the root of our\r\n    parliamentary government? under which the first duty of a majority\r\n    freshly elected, according to a uniform course of precedent and a\r\n    very clear principle, is to establish a government which has its\r\n    confidence.\r\n\r\n    3. Will this abdication of primary duty avert or materially\r\n    postpone the (apprehended) disruption of the party? Who can\r\n    guarantee us against an Irish or independent amendment to the\r\n    Address? The government must in any case produce at once their\r\n    Irish plan. What will have been gained by waiting for it? The\r\n    Irish will know three things—(1) That I am conditionally in favour\r\n    of at least examining their demand. (2) That from the nature of\r\n    the case, I must hold this question paramount to every interest of\r\n    party. (3) That a part, to speak within bounds, of the liberal\r\n    party will follow me in this respect. Can it be supposed that in\r\n    these circumstances they will long refrain, or possibly refrain at\r\n    all? With their knowledge of possibilities behind them, _dare_\r\n    they long refrain? An immense loss of dignity in a great crisis of\r\n    the empire would attend the forcing of our hands by the Irish or\r\n    otherwise. There is no necessity for an instant decision. My\r\n    desire is thoroughly to shake up all the materials of the\r\n    question. The present leaning of my mind is to consider the faults\r\n    and dangers of abstention greater than those of a more decided\r\n    course. Hence, in part, my great anxiety that the present\r\n    government should move. Please send this on to Granville.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinding Mr. Gladstone immovable at Hawarden, four of the members of the\r\nlast liberal cabinet of both wings met at Devonshire House on New Year’s\r\nday. All, save one, found themselves hopeless, especially after the\r\nHawarden revelations, as to the possibility of governing Ireland by mere\r\nrepression. Lord Hartington at once communicated the desires of the\r\nconclave for information of his views and designs. Mr. Gladstone replied\r\n(January 2, 1886):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    On the 17th December I communicated to you _all_ the opinions I\r\n    had formed on the Irish question. But on the 21st you published in\r\n    the _Times_ a re-affirmation of opposite opinions.\r\n\r\n    On the Irish question, I have not a word to add to that letter. I\r\n    am indeed doing what little the pressure of correspondence\r\n    permits, to prepare myself by study and reflection. My object was\r\n    to facilitate study by you and others—I cannot say it was wholly\r\n    gained. But I have done nothing, and shall do nothing, to convert\r\n    those opinions into intentions, for I have not the material before\r\n    me. I do not know whether my “postulate” is satisfied.... I have\r\n    taken care by my letter of the 17th that you should know my\r\n    opinions _en bloc_. You are quite welcome to show it, if you think\r\n    fit, to those whom you met. But Harcourt has, I believe, seen it,\r\n    and the others, if I mistake not, know the substance.... There is\r\n    no doubt that a very grave situation is upon us, a little sooner\r\n    or a little later. All my desire and thought was how to render it\r\n    less grave, for next to the demands of a question far higher than\r\n    all or any party interests, is my duty to labour for the\r\n    consolidation of the party.... Pray show this letter, if you think\r\n    fit, to those on whose behalf you write. I propose to be available\r\n    in London about 4 P.M., for any who wish to see me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nSignals and intimations were not wholly wanting from the Irish camp. It\r\nwas known among the subalterns in that rather impenetrable region, partly\r\nby the light of nature, partly by the indiscretions of dubiously\r\naccredited ambassadors, that Mr. Gladstone was not disposed on any terms\r\nto meet the Irish demand by more coercion. For the liberal party as a\r\nwhole the Irish had a considerable aversion. The violent scenes that\r\nattended the Coercion bill of 1881, the interchange of hard words, the\r\nsuspensions, the imprisonments—all mechanically acquiesced in by the\r\nministerial majority—had engendered both bitterness and contempt. The\r\nIrishmen did not conceal the satisfaction with which they saw the defeat\r\nof some of those liberals who had openly gloated over their arrests and\r\nall the rest of their humiliations. Mr. Gladstone, it is true, had laid a\r\nheavy and chastening hand upon them. Yet, even when the struggle had been\r\nfiercest, with the quick intuition of a people long oppressed, they\r\ndetected a note of half-sympathetic passion which convinced them that he\r\nwould be their friend if he could, and would help them when he might.\r\n\r\nMr. Parnell was not open to impressions of this order. He had a long\r\nmemory for injuries, and he had by no means satisfied himself that the\r\nsame injuries might not recur. As soon as the general election was over,\r\nhe had at once set to work upon the result. Whatever might be right for\r\nothers, his line of tactics was plain—to ascertain from which of the two\r\nEnglish parties he was most likely to obtain the response that he desired\r\nto the Irish demand, and then to concert the procedure best fitted to\r\nplace that party in power. He was at first not sure whether Lord Salisbury\r\nwould renounce the Irish alliance after it had served the double purpose\r\nof ousting the liberals from office, and then reducing their numbers at\r\nthe election. He seems also to have counted upon further communications\r\nwith Lord Carnarvon, and this expectation was made known to Mr. Gladstone,\r\nwho expressed his satisfaction at the news, though it was also made known\r\nto him that Mr. Parnell doubted (M102) Lord Carnarvon’s power to carry out\r\nhis unquestionably favourable dispositions. He at the same time very\r\nnaturally did his best to get some light as to Mr. Gladstone’s own frame\r\nof mind. If neither party would offer a solution of the problem of Irish\r\ngovernment, Mr. Parnell would prefer to keep the tories in office, as they\r\nwould at least work out gradually a solution of the problems of Irish\r\nland. To all these indirect communications Mr. Gladstone’s consistent\r\nreply was that Mr. Parnell’s immediate business was with the government of\r\nthe day, first, because only the government could handle the matter;\r\nsecond, because a tory government with the aid that it would receive from\r\nliberals, might most certainly, safely, and quickly settle it. He declined\r\nto go beyond the ground already publicly taken by him, unless by way of a\r\nfurther public declaration. On to this new ground he would not go, until\r\nassured that the government had had a fair opportunity given them.\r\n\r\nBy the end of December Mr. Parnell decided that there was not the\r\nslightest possibility of any settlement being offered by the conservatives\r\nunder the existing circumstances. “Whatever chance there was,” he said,\r\n“disappeared when the seemingly authoritative statements of Mr.\r\nGladstone’s intention to deal with the question were published.” He\r\nregarded it as quite probable that in spite of a direct refusal from the\r\ntories, the Irish members might prefer to pull along with them, rather\r\nthan run the risk of fresh coercion from the liberals, should the latter\r\nreturn to power. “Supposing,” he argued, “that the liberals came into\r\noffice, and that they offered a settlement of so incomplete a character\r\nthat we could not accept it, or that owing to defections they could not\r\ncarry it, should we not, if any long interval occurred before the proposal\r\nof a fresh settlement, incur considerable risk of further coercion?” At\r\nany rate, they had better keep the government in, rather than oust them in\r\norder to admit Lord Hartington or Mr. Chamberlain with a new coercion bill\r\nin their pockets.\r\n\r\nForeseeing these embarrassments, Mr. Gladstone wrote in a final memorandum\r\n(December 24) of this eventful year, “I used every effort to obtain a\r\nclear majority at the election, and failed. I am therefore at present a\r\nman in chains. Will ministers bring in a measure? If ‘Aye,’ I see my way.\r\nIf ‘No’: that I presume puts an end to all relations of confidence between\r\nnationalists and tories. If that is done, I have then upon me, as is\r\nevident, the responsibilities of _the leader of a majority_. But what if\r\nneither Aye nor No can be had—will the nationalists then continue their\r\nsupport and thus relieve me from responsibility, or withdraw their support\r\n[from the government] and thus change essentially my position? Nothing but\r\na public or published dissolution of a relation of amity publicly sealed\r\ncould be of any avail.”\r\n\r\nSo the year ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV. Fall Of The First Salisbury Government. (January 1886)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Historians coolly dissect a man’s thoughts as they please; and\r\n    label them like specimens in a naturalist’s cabinet. Such a thing,\r\n    they argue, was done for mere personal aggrandizement; such a\r\n    thing for national objects; such a thing from high religious\r\n    motives. In real life we may be sure it was not so.—GARDINER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nMinisters meanwhile hesitated, balanced, doubted, and wavered. Their party\r\nwas in a minority, and so they had a fair plea for resigning and not\r\nmeeting the new parliament. On the other hand, they had a fair plea for\r\ncontinuing in office, for though they were in a minority, no other party\r\nhad a majority. Nobody knew what the Hartington whigs would do, or what\r\nthe Irish would do. There seemed to be many chances for expert angling.\r\nThen with what policy were they to meet the House of Commons? They might\r\nadhere to the conciliatory policy of the summer and autumn, keep clear of\r\nrepressive legislation, and make a bold attempt in the direction of\r\nself-government. Taking the same courageous plunge as was taken by\r\nWellington and Peel in 1829, by Peel in the winter of 1845, by Disraeli in\r\n1867, they might carry the declarations made by Lord Carnarvon on behalf\r\nof the government in July to their only practical conclusion. But then\r\nthey would have broken up their party, as Wellington and Peel broke it up;\r\nand Lord Salisbury may have asked himself whether the national emergency\r\nwarranted the party risk.\r\n\r\nResistance then to the Irish demand being assumed, various tactics came\r\nunder review. They might begin by asking for a vote of confidence, saying\r\nplainly that if they were turned out and Mr. Gladstone were put in, he\r\nwould propose home rule. In that case a majority was not wholly\r\nimpossible, for the whig wing might come over, nor was it quite certain\r\nthat the Irish would help to put the government out. At any rate the\r\ndebate would force Mr. Gladstone into the open, and even if they did not\r\nhave a majority, they would be in a position to advise immediate\r\ndissolution on the issue of home rule.\r\n\r\nThe only other course open to the cabinet was to turn their backs upon the\r\nprofessions of the summer; to throw overboard the Carnarvon policy as a\r\ncargo for which there was no longer a market; to abandon a great\r\nexperiment after a ludicrously short trial; and to pick up again the old\r\ninstrument of coercion, which not six months before they had with such\r\nelaborate ostentation condemned and discarded. This grand manœuvre was\r\nkept carefully in the background, until there had been time for the whole\r\nchapter of accidents to exhaust itself, and it had become certain that no\r\ntrump cards were falling to the ministerial hand. Not until this was quite\r\nclear, did ministers reveal their poignant uneasiness about the state of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of October (1885) Lord Randolph Churchill visited the\r\nviceroy in Dublin, and found him, as he afterwards said, extremely anxious\r\nand alarmed at the growing power of the National League. Yet the viceroy\r\nwas not so anxious and alarmed as to prevent Lord Randolph from saying at\r\nBirmingham a month after, on November 20, that up to the present time\r\ntheir decision to preserve order by the same laws as in England had been\r\nabundantly justified, and that on the whole crime and outrage had greatly\r\ndiminished. This was curious, and shows how tortuous was the crisis. Only\r\na fortnight later the cabinet met (December 2), and heard of the\r\nextraordinary development and unlimited resources of the league. All the\r\nrest of the month of December,—so the public were by and by informed,—the\r\ncondition of Ireland was the subject of the most anxious consideration.\r\nWith great deliberation, a decision was at length reached. It was that\r\nordinary law had broken down, and that exceptional means of repression\r\nwere indispensable. Then a (M103) serious and embarrassing incident\r\noccurred. Lord Carnarvon “threw up the government of Ireland,” and was\r\nfollowed by Sir William Hart Dyke, the chief secretary.(171) A measure of\r\ncoercion was prepared, its provisions all drawn in statutory form, but who\r\nwas to warrant the necessity for it to parliament?(172)\r\n\r\nThough the viceroy’s retirement was not publicly known until the middle of\r\nJanuary, yet so early as December 17 the prime minister had applied to Mr.\r\nSmith, then secretary of state for war, to undertake the duties of Irish\r\ngovernment.(173) This was one of the sacrifices that no man of public\r\nspirit can ever refuse, and Mr. Smith, who had plenty of public spirit,\r\nbecame Irish secretary. Still when parliament assembled more than a month\r\nafter Lord Salisbury’s letter to his new chief secretary, no policy was\r\nannounced. Even on the second night of the session Mr. Smith answered\r\nquestions for the war office. The parliamentary mystification was\r\ncomplete. Who, where, and what was the Irish government?\r\n\r\nThe parliamentary session was rapidly approaching, and Mr. Gladstone had\r\ngood information of the various quarters whence the wind was blowing.\r\nRumours reached him (January 9) from the purlieus of Parliament Street,\r\nthat general words of confidence in the government would be found in the\r\nQueen’s Speech. Next he was told of the report that an amendment would be\r\nmoved by the ultras of law and order,—the same who had mutinied on the\r\nMaamtrasna debate,—censuring ministers for having failed to uphold the\r\nauthority of the Queen. The same correspondent (January 15), who was well\r\nable to make his words good, wrote to Mr. Gladstone that even though home\r\nrule might perhaps not be in a parliamentary sense before the House, it\r\nwas in a most distinct manner before the country, and no political party\r\ncould avoid expressing an opinion upon it. On the same day another\r\ncolleague of hardly less importance drew attention to an article in a\r\njournal supposed to be inspired by Lord Randolph, to the effect that\r\nconciliation in Ireland had totally failed, that Lord Carnarvon had\r\nretired because that policy was to be reversed and he was not the man for\r\nthe rival policy of vigour, and finally, that the new policy would\r\nprobably be announced in the Queen’s Speech; in no circumstances would it\r\nbe possible to avoid a general action on the Address.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe current of domestic life at Hawarden, in the midst of all these\r\nperplexities, flowed in its usual ordered channels. The engagement of his\r\nsecond daughter stirred Mr. Gladstone’s deepest interest. He practised\r\noccasional woodcraft with his sons, though ending his seventy-sixth year.\r\nHe spends a morning in reviewing his private money affairs, the first time\r\nfor three years. He never misses church. He corrects the proofs of an\r\narticle on Huxley; carries on tolerably profuse correspondence, coming to\r\nvery little; he works among his books, and arranges his papers; reads\r\nBeaconsfield’s _Home Letters_, Lord Stanhope’s _Pitt_, Macaulay’s _Warren\r\nHastings_, which he counts the most brilliant of all that illustrious\r\nman’s performances; Maine on _Popular Government_; _King Solomon’s Mines_;\r\nsomething of Tolstoy; Dicey’s _Law of the Constitution_, where a chapter\r\non semi-sovereign assemblies made a deep impression on him in regard to\r\nthe business that now absorbed his mind. Above all, he nearly every day\r\nreads Burke: “_December 18._—Read Burke; what a magazine of wisdom on\r\nIreland and America. _January 9._—Made many extracts from Burke—_sometimes\r\nalmost divine_.”(174) We may easily imagine how the heat from that\r\nprofound and glowing furnace still further inflamed strong purposes and\r\nexalted resolution in Mr. Gladstone. The Duke of Argyll wrote to say that\r\nhe was sorry to hear of the study of Burke: “Your _perfervidum ingenium\r\nScoti_ does not need being touched with a live coal from that Irish altar.\r\nOf course your reference to Burke indicates a tendency to compare our\r\nposition as regards Ireland to the position of George III. towards the\r\ncolonies. I deny that there is any parallelism or even analogy.” (M104) It\r\nwas during these months that he renewed his friendly intercourse with\r\nCardinal Manning, which had been suspended since the controversy upon the\r\nVatican pamphlets. In November Mr. Gladstone sent Manning his article on\r\nthe “Dawn of Creation.” The cardinal thanked him for the paper—“still more\r\nfor your words, which revive the memories of old days. Fifty-five years\r\nare a long reach of life in which to remember each other. We have twice\r\nbeen parted, but as the path declines, as you say, it narrows, and I am\r\nglad that we are again nearing each other as we near our end.... If we\r\ncannot unite in the realm where ‘the morning stars sang together’ we\r\nshould be indeed far off.” Much correspondence followed on the articles\r\nagainst Huxley. Then his birthday came:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Postal deliveries and other arrivals were seven hundred.\r\n    Immeasurable kindness almost overwhelmed us. There was also the\r\n    heavy and incessant weight of the Irish question, which offers\r\n    daily phases more or less new. It was a day for intense\r\n    thankfulness, but, alas, not for recollection and detachment. When\r\n    will that day come? Until then, why string together the\r\n    commonplaces and generalities of great things, really unfelt?... I\r\n    am certain there is one keen and deep desire to be extricated from\r\n    the life of contention in which a chain of incidents has for the\r\n    last four years detained me against all my will. Then, indeed, I\r\n    should reach an eminence from which I could look before and after.\r\n    But I know truly that I am not worthy of this liberty with which\r\n    Christ makes free his elect. In his own good time, something, I\r\n    trust, will for me too be mercifully devised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of this long travail, which anybody else would have found all\r\nthe sorer for the isolation and quietude that it was ever Mr. Gladstone’s\r\nfashion in moments of emergency to seek, he reached London on January\r\n11th; two days later he took the oath in the new parliament, whose life\r\nwas destined to be so short; and then he found himself on the edge of the\r\nwhirlpool. Three days before formalities were over, and the House\r\nassembled for the despatch of business, he received a communication that\r\nmuch perturbed him, and shed an ominous light on the prospect of liberal\r\nunity. This communication he described to Lord Granville:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _21 Carlton House Terrace, Jan. 18, 1886._—Hartington writes to me\r\n    a letter indicating the possibility that on Thursday, while I\r\n    announce with reasons a policy of silence and reserve, he may feel\r\n    it his duty to declare his determination “to maintain the\r\n    legislative union,” that is to proclaim a policy (so I understand\r\n    the phrase) of absolute resistance without examination to the\r\n    demand made by Ireland through five-sixths of her members. This is\r\n    to play the tory game with a vengeance. They are now, most rashly\r\n    not to say more, working the Irish question to split the liberal\r\n    party.\r\n\r\n    It seems to me that if a gratuitous declaration of this kind is\r\n    made, it must produce an explosion; and that in a week’s time\r\n    Hartington will have to consider whether he will lead the liberal\r\n    party himself, or leave it to chaos. He will make my position\r\n    impossible. When, in conformity with the wishes expressed to me, I\r\n    changed my plans and became a candidate at the general election,\r\n    my motives were two. The _first_, a hope that I might be able to\r\n    contribute towards some pacific settlement of the Irish question.\r\n    The _second_, a desire to prevent the splitting of the party, of\r\n    which there appeared to be an immediate danger. The second object\r\n    has thus far been attained. But it may at any moment be lost, and\r\n    the most disastrous mode of losing it perhaps would be that now\r\n    brought into view. It would be certainly opposed to my convictions\r\n    and determination, to attempt to lead anything like a home rule\r\n    opposition, and to make this subject—the strife of nations—the\r\n    dividing line between parties. This being so, I do not see how I\r\n    could as leader survive a gratuitous declaration of opposition to\r\n    me such as Hartington appears to meditate. If he still meditates\r\n    it, ought not the party to be previously informed?\r\n\r\n    Pray, consider whether you can bring this subject before him, less\r\n    invidiously than I. I have explained to you and I believe to him,\r\n    and I believe you approve, my general idea, that we ought not to\r\n    join issue with the government on what is called home rule (which\r\n    indeed the social state of Ireland may effectually thrust aside\r\n    for the time); and that still less ought we to join issue among\r\n    ourselves, if we have a choice, unless and until we are called\r\n    upon to consider whether or not to take the government. I for one\r\n    will have nothing to do with ruining the party if I can avoid it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter discloses with precision the critical state of facts on the\r\neve of action being taken. Issue was not directly joined with ministers on\r\nhome rule; no choice was found to exist as to taking the government; and\r\nthis brought deep and long-standing diversities among the liberal leaders\r\nto the issue that Mr. Gladstone had strenuously laboured to avoid from the\r\nbeginning of 1885 to the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Irish paragraphs in the speech from the throne (January 21, 1886) were\r\nabstract, hypothetical, and vague. The sovereign was made to say that\r\nduring the past year there had been no marked increase of serious crime,\r\nbut there was in many places a concerted resistance to the enforcement of\r\nlegal obligations, and the practice of intimidation continued to exist.\r\n“If,” the speech went on, “as my information leads me to apprehend, the\r\nexisting provisions of the law should prove to be inadequate to cope with\r\nthese growing evils, I look with confidence to your willingness to invest\r\nmy government with all necessary powers.” There was also an abstract\r\nparagraph about the legislative union between the two islands.\r\n\r\nIn a fragment composed in the autumn of 1897, Mr. Gladstone has described\r\nthe anxiety with which he watched the course of proceedings on the\r\nAddress:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I had no means of forming an estimate how far the bulk of the\r\n    liberal party could be relied on to support a measure of home\r\n    rule, which should constitute an Irish parliament subject to the\r\n    supremacy of the parliament at Westminster. I was not sanguine on\r\n    this head. Even in the month of December, when rumours of my\r\n    intentions were afloat, I found how little I could reckon on a\r\n    general support. Under the circumstances I certainly took upon\r\n    myself a grave responsibility. I attached value to the acts and\r\n    language of Lord Carnarvon, and the other favourable\r\n    manifestations. Subsequently we had but too much evidence of a\r\n    deliberate intention to deceive the Irish, with a view to their\r\n    support at the election. But in the actual circumstances I thought\r\n    it my duty to encourage the government of Lord Salisbury to settle\r\n    the Irish question, so far as I could do this by promises of my\r\n    personal support. Hence my communication with Mr. Balfour, which\r\n    has long been in the hands of the public.\r\n\r\n    It has been unreasonably imputed to me, that the proposal of home\r\n    rule was a bid for the Irish vote. But my desire for the\r\n    adjustment of the question by the tories is surely a conclusive\r\n    answer. The fact is that I could not rely upon the collective\r\n    support of the liberals; but I could and did rely upon the support\r\n    of so many of them as would make the success of the measure\r\n    certain, in the event of its being proposed by the tory\r\n    administration. It would have resembled in substance the liberal\r\n    support given to Roman catholic emancipation in 1829, and the\r\n    repeal of the corn laws in 1846. Before the meeting of parliament,\r\n    I had to encounter uncomfortable symptoms among my principal\r\n    friends, of which I think —— was the organ.\r\n\r\n    I was, therefore, by no means eager for the dismissal of the tory\r\n    government, though it counted but 250 supporters out of 670, as\r\n    long as there were hopes of its taking up the question, or at all\r\n    events doing nothing to aggravate the situation.\r\n\r\n    When we came to the debate on the Address I had to face a night of\r\n    extreme anxiety. The speech from the throne referred in a menacing\r\n    way to Irish disturbances, and contained a distinct declaration in\r\n    support of the legislative union. On referring to the clerks at\r\n    the table to learn in what terms the Address in reply to the\r\n    speech was couched, I found it was a “thanking” address, which did\r\n    not commit the House to an opinion. What I dreaded was lest some\r\n    one should have gone back to the precedent of 1833, when the\r\n    Address in reply to the speech was virtually made the vehicle of a\r\n    solemn declaration in favour of the Act of Union.(175)\r\n\r\n    Home rule, rightly understood, altered indeed the terms of the Act\r\n    of Union, but adhered to its principle, which was the supremacy of\r\n    the imperial parliament. Still [it] was pretty certain that any\r\n    declaration of a substantive character, at the epoch we had now\r\n    reached, would in its moral effect shut the doors of the existing\r\n    parliament against home rule.\r\n\r\n    In a speech of pronounced clearness, Mr. Arthur Elliot endeavoured\r\n    to obtain a movement in this direction. I thought it would be\r\n    morally fatal if this tone were extensively adopted on the liberal\r\n    side; so I determined on an effort to secure reserve for the time,\r\n    that our freedom might not be compromised. I, therefore, ventured\r\n    upon describing myself as an “old parliamentary hand,” and in that\r\n    capacity strongly advised the party to keep its own counsel, and\r\n    await for a little the development of events. Happily this counsel\r\n    was taken; had it been otherwise, the early formation of a\r\n    government favourable to home rule would in all likelihood have\r\n    become an impossibility. For although our Home Rule bill was\r\n    eventually supported by more than 300 members, I doubt whether, if\r\n    the question had been prematurely raised on the night of the\r\n    Address, as many as 200 would have been disposed to act in that\r\n    sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the debate on the Address the draft Coercion bill reposing in the\r\nsecret box was not mentioned. Sir Michael Hicks Beach, the leader of the\r\nHouse, described the mischiefs then afoot, and went on to say that whether\r\nthey could be dealt with by ordinary law, or would require exceptional\r\npowers, were questions that would receive the new chief secretary’s\r\nimmediate attention,(176) Parliament was told that the minister had\r\nactually gone to Ireland to make anxious inquiry into these questions. Mr.\r\nSmith arrived in Dublin at six o’clock on the morning of January 24, and\r\nhe quitted it at six o’clock on the evening of the 26th. He was sworn in\r\nat the Castle in the forenoon of that day.(177) His views must have\r\nreached the cabinet in London not later than the morning of the 26th. Not\r\noften can conclusions on such a subject have been ripened with such\r\nelectrifying precocity.\r\n\r\n“I intend to reserve my own freedom of action,” Mr. Gladstone said; “there\r\nare many who have taken their seats for the first time upon these benches,\r\nand I may avail myself of the privilege of old age to offer a\r\nrecommendation. I would tell them of my own intention to keep my counsel\r\nand reserve my own freedom, until I see the moment and the occasion when\r\nthere may be a prospect of public benefit in endeavouring to make a\r\nmovement forward, and I will venture to recommend them, as an old\r\nparliamentary hand, to do the same.”(178) Something in this turn of phrase\r\nkindled lively irritation, and it drew bitter reproaches from more than\r\none of the younger whigs. The angriest of these remonstrances was listened\r\nto from beginning to end without a solitary cheer from the liberal\r\nbenches. The great bulk of the party took their leader’s advice. Of course\r\nthe reserve of his speech was as significant of Irish concession, as the\r\nmost open declaration would have been. Yet there was no rebellion. This\r\nwas felt by ministers to be a decisive omen of the general support likely\r\nto be given to Mr. Gladstone’s supposed policy by his own party. Mr.\r\nParnell offered some complimentary remarks on the language of Mr.\r\nGladstone, but he made no move in the direction of an amendment. The\r\npublic outside looked on with stupefaction. For two or three days all\r\nseemed to be in suspense. But the two ministerial leaders in the Commons\r\nknew how to read the signs. What Sir Michael (M105) Hicks Beach and Lord\r\nRandolph foresaw, for one thing was an understanding between Mr. Gladstone\r\nand the Irishmen, and for another, they foresaw the acquiescence of the\r\nmass of the liberals. This twofold discovery cleared the ground for a\r\ndecision. After the second night’s debate ministers saw that the only\r\nchance now was to propose coercion. Then it was that the ephemeral chief\r\nsecretary had started on his voyage for the discovery of something that\r\nhad already been found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 26th, the leader of the House gave notice that two\r\ndays later the new Irish secretary would ask leave to introduce a bill\r\ndealing with the National League, with intimidation, and with the\r\nprotection of life, property, and public order. This would be followed by\r\na bill dealing with land, pursuing in a more extensive sense the policy of\r\nthe Ashbourne Act of the year before. The great issue was thus at last\r\nbrought suddenly and nakedly into view. When the Irish secretary reached\r\nEuston Square on the morning of the 27th, he found that his government was\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe crucial announcement of the 26th of January compelled a prompt\r\ndetermination, and Mr. Gladstone did not shrink. A protest against a\r\nreturn to coercion as the answer of the British parliament to the\r\nextraordinary demonstration from Ireland, carried with it the\r\nresponsibility of office, and this responsibility Mr. Gladstone had\r\nresolved to undertake.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The determining event of these transactions,—he says in the\r\n    fragment already cited,—was the declaration of the government that\r\n    they would propose coercion for Ireland. This declaration put an\r\n    end to all the hopes and expectations associated with the mission\r\n    of Lord Carnarvon. Not perhaps in mere logic, but practically, it\r\n    was now plain that Ireland had no hope from the tories. This being\r\n    so, my rule of action was changed at once, and I determined on\r\n    taking any and every legitimate opportunity to remove the existing\r\n    government from office. Immediately on making up my mind about the\r\n    rejection of the government, I went to call upon Sir William\r\n    Harcourt and informed him as to my intentions and the grounds of\r\n    them. He said, “What! Are you prepared to go forward without\r\n    either Hartington or Chamberlain?” I answered, “Yes.” I believe it\r\n    was in my mind to say, if I did not actually say it, that I was\r\n    prepared to go forward without anybody. That is to say without any\r\n    known and positive assurance of support. This was one of the great\r\n    imperial occasions which call for such resolutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn amendment stood upon the notice-paper in the name of Mr. Collings,\r\nregretting the omission from the speech of measures for benefiting the\r\nrural labourer; and on this motion an immediate engagement was fought.\r\nTime was important. An exasperating debate on coercion with obstruction,\r\ndisorder, suspensions, would have been a damning prologue to any policy of\r\naccommodation. The true significance of the motion was not concealed. On\r\nthe agrarian aspect of it, the only important feature was the adhesion of\r\nMr. Gladstone, now first formally declared, to the policy of Mr.\r\nChamberlain. The author of the agrarian policy fought out once more on the\r\nfloor of the House against Lord Hartington and Mr. Goschen the battle of\r\nthe platform. It was left for Sir Michael Hicks Beach to remind the House\r\nthat, whatever the honest mover might mean, the rural labourer had very\r\nlittle to do with the matter, and he implored the gentlemen in front of\r\nhim to think twice and thrice before they committed the future of this\r\ncountry to the gravest dangers that ever awaited it.\r\n\r\nThe debate was not prolonged. The discussion opened shortly before dinner,\r\nand by one o’clock the division was taken. The government found itself in\r\na minority of 79. The majority numbered 331, composed of 257 liberals and\r\n74 Irish nationalists. The ministerialist minority was 252, made up of 234\r\ntories and 18 liberals. Besides the fact that Lord Hartington, Mr.\r\nGoschen, and Sir Henry James voted with ministers, there was a still more\r\nominous circumstance. No fewer than 76 liberals were absent, including\r\namong them the imposing personality of Mr. Bright. In a memorandum written\r\nfor submission to the Queen a few days later, Mr. Gladstone said, “I must\r\nexpress my personal conviction that had the late ministers remained in\r\noffice and proceeded with their proposed plan of repression, and even had\r\nthat plan received my support, it would have ended in a disastrous\r\nparliamentary failure.”(179)\r\n\r\nThe next day (Jan. 28) ministers of course determined to resign. A liberal\r\nmember of parliament was overtaken by Lord Randolph on the parade ground,\r\nwalking away from the cabinet. “You look a little pensive,” said the\r\nliberal. “Yes; I was thinking. I have plenty to think of. Well, we are\r\nout, and you are in.” “I suppose so,” the liberal replied, “we are in for\r\nsix months; we dissolve; you are in for six years.” “Not at all sure,”\r\nsaid Lord Randolph; “let me tell you one thing most solemnly and most\r\nsurely: the conservative party are not going to be made the instrument of\r\nthe Irish for turning out Mr. Gladstone, if he refuses repeal.” “Nobody,”\r\nobserved the sententious liberal, “should so often as the politician say\r\nthe prayer not to be led into temptation. Remember your doings last\r\nsummer.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter  V. The New Policy. (1886)\r\n\r\n\r\n    In reason all government without the consent of the governed is\r\n    the very definition of slavery; but in fact eleven men well armed\r\n    will certainly subdue one single man in his shirt.... Those who\r\n    have used to cramp liberty have gone so far as to resent even the\r\n    liberty of complaining; although a man upon the rack was never\r\n    known to be refused the liberty of roaring as loud as he thought\r\n    fit.—JONATHAN SWIFT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tory government was defeated in the sitting of Tuesday (Jan. 26). On\r\nFriday, “at a quarter after midnight, in came Sir H. Ponsonby, with verbal\r\ncommission from her Majesty, which I at once accepted.”(180) The whole of\r\nSaturday was spent in consultations with colleagues. On Sunday, Mr.\r\nGladstone records, “except church, my day from one to eight was given to\r\nbusiness. I got only fragmentary reading of the life of the admirable Mr.\r\nSuckling and other books. At night came a painful and harassing succession\r\nof letters, and my sleep for once gave way; yet for the soul it was\r\nprofitable, driving me to the hope that the strength of God might be made\r\nmanifest in my weakness.” On Monday, Feb. 1, he went to attend the Queen.\r\n“Off at 9.10 to Osborne. Two audiences: an hour and half in all.\r\nEverything good in the main points. Large discourse upon Ireland in\r\nparticular. Returned at 7-¾. I kissed hands and am thereby prime minister\r\nfor the third time. But, as I trust, for a brief time only. Slept well,\r\n_D.G._”\r\n\r\nThe first question was, how many of his colleagues in the liberal cabinet\r\nthat went out of office six months before, would now embark with him in\r\nthe voyage into stormy and unexplored seas. I should suppose that no such\r\ndifficulties (M106) had ever confronted the attempt at making a cabinet\r\nsince Canning’s in 1827.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone begins the fragment from which I have already quoted with a\r\nsentence or two of retrospect, and then proceeds:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    In 1885 (I think) Chamberlain had proposed a plan accepted by\r\n    Parnell (and supported by me) which, without establishing in\r\n    Ireland a national parliament, made very considerable advances\r\n    towards self-government. It was rejected by a small majority of\r\n    the cabinet—Granville said at the time he would rather take home\r\n    rule. Spencer thought it would introduce confusion into executive\r\n    duties.\r\n\r\n    On the present occasion a full half of the former ministers\r\n    declined to march with me. Spencer and Granville were my main\r\n    supports. Chamberlain and Trevelyan went with me, their basis\r\n    being that we were to seek for some method of dealing with the\r\n    Irish case other than coercion. What Chamberlain’s motive was I do\r\n    not clearly understand. It was stated that he coveted the Irish\r\n    secretaryship.... To have given him the office would at that time\r\n    have been held to be a declaration of war against the Irish party.\r\n\r\n    Selborne nibbled at the offer, but I felt that it would not work,\r\n    and did not use great efforts to bring him in.(181)\r\n\r\n    When I had accepted the commission, Ponsonby brought me a message\r\n    from the Queen that she hoped there would not be any Separation in\r\n    the cabinet. The word had not at that time acquired the offensive\r\n    meaning in which it has since been stereotyped by the so-called\r\n    unionists; and it was easy to frame a reply in general but strong\r\n    words. I am bound to say that at Osborne in the course of a long\r\n    conversation, the Queen was frank and free, and showed none of the\r\n    “armed neutrality,” which as far as I know has been the best\r\n    definition of her attitude in the more recent years towards a\r\n    liberal minister. Upon the whole, when I look back upon 1886, and\r\n    consider the inveterate sentiment of hostility flavoured with\r\n    contempt towards Ireland, which has from time immemorial formed\r\n    the basis of English, tradition, I am much more disposed to be\r\n    thankful for what we then and afterwards accomplished, than to\r\n    murmur or to wonder at what we did not.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Mr. Gladstone called the basis of his new government was set out in a\r\nshort memorandum, which he read to each of those whom he hoped to include\r\nin his cabinet: “I propose to examine whether it is or is not practicable\r\nto comply with the desire widely prevalent in Ireland, and testified by\r\nthe return of eighty-five out of one hundred and three representatives,\r\nfor the establishment by statute of a legislative body to sit in Dublin,\r\nand to deal with Irish as distinguished from imperial affairs; in such a\r\nmanner as would be just to each of the three kingdoms, equitable with\r\nreference to every class of the people of Ireland, conducive to the social\r\norder and harmony of that country, and calculated to support and\r\nconsolidate the unity of the empire on the continued basis of imperial\r\nauthority and mutual attachment.”\r\n\r\nNo definite plan was propounded or foreshadowed, but only the proposition\r\nthat it was a duty to seek a plan. The cynical version was that a cabinet\r\nwas got together on the chance of being able to agree. To Lord Hartington,\r\nMr. Gladstone applied as soon as he received the Queen’s commission. The\r\ninvitation was declined on reasoned grounds (January 30). Examination and\r\ninquiry, said Lord Hartington, must mean a proposal. If no proposal\r\nfollowed inquiry, the reaction of Irish disappointment would be severe, as\r\nit would be natural. His adherence, moreover, would be of little value. He\r\nhad already, he observed, in the government of 1880 made concessions on\r\nother subjects that might be thought to have shaken public confidence in\r\nhim; he could go no further without destroying that confidence altogether.\r\nHowever that might be, he could not depart from the traditions of British\r\nstatesmen, and he was opposed to a separate Irish legislature. At the same\r\ntime he concluded, in a sentence afterwards pressed by Mr. Gladstone on\r\nthe notice of the Queen: “I am fully convinced that the alternative policy\r\nof governing Ireland without large concessions to the national sentiment,\r\npresents difficulties of a tremendous character, which in my opinion could\r\nnow only be faced by the support of a nation united by the consciousness\r\nthat the fullest opportunity had been given for the production and\r\nconsideration of a conciliatory policy.”\r\n\r\nA few days later (February 5) Lord Hartington wrote: “I have been told\r\nthat I have been represented as having been in general agreement with you\r\non your Irish policy, and having been prevented joining your government\r\nsolely by the declarations which I made to my constituents; and as not\r\nintending to oppose the government even on home rule. On looking over my\r\nletter I think that the general intention is sufficiently clear, but there\r\nis part of one sentence which, taken by itself, might be understood as\r\ncommitting me beyond what I intended or wished. The words I refer to are\r\nthose in which I say that it may be possible for me as a private member to\r\nprevent obstacles being placed in the way of a fair trial being given to\r\nthe policy of the new government. But I think that the commencement of the\r\nsentence in which these words occur sufficiently reserves my liberty, and\r\nthat the whole letter shows that what I desire is that the somewhat\r\nundefined declarations which have hitherto been made should now assume a\r\npractical shape.”(182)\r\n\r\nThe decision was persistently regarded by Mr. Gladstone as an important\r\nevent in English political history. With a small number of distinguished\r\nindividual exceptions, it marked the withdrawal from the liberal party of\r\nthe aristocratic element. Up to a very recent date this had been its\r\ngoverning element. Until 1868, the whig nobles and their connections held\r\nthe reins and shaped the policy. After the accession of a leader from\r\noutside of the caste in 1868, when Mr. Gladstone for the first time became\r\nprime minister, they continued to hold more than their share of the\r\noffices, but in cabinet they sank to the position of what is called a\r\nmoderating force. After 1880 it became every day more clear that even this\r\nmodest function was slipping away. Lord Hartington found that the\r\nmoderating force could no longer moderate. If he went on, he must make up\r\nhis mind to go under the Caudine forks once a week. The significant\r\nreference, among his reasons for not joining the new ministry, to the\r\nconcessions that he had made in the last government for the sake of party\r\nunity, and to his feeling that any further moves of the same kind for the\r\nsame purpose would destroy all public confidence in him, shows just as the\r\ncircumstances of the election had shown, and as the recent debate on the\r\nCollings amendment had shown, how small were the chances, quite apart from\r\nIrish policy, of uniting whig and radical wings in any durable liberal\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nMr. Goschen, who had been a valuable member of the great ministry of 1868,\r\nwas invited to call, but without hopes that he would rally to a cause so\r\nstartling; the interview, while courteous and pleasant, was over in a very\r\nfew minutes. Lord Derby, a man of still more cautious type, and a rather\r\nrecent addition to the officers of the liberal staff, declined, not\r\nwithout good nature. Lord Northbrook had no faith in a new Irish policy,\r\nand his confidence in his late leader had been shaken by Egypt. Most\r\nlamented of all the abstentions was the honoured and trusted name of Mr.\r\nBright.\r\n\r\nMr. Trevelyan agreed to join, in the entirely defensible hope that they\r\n“would knock the measure about in the cabinet, as cabinets do,” and mould\r\nit into accord with what had until now been the opinion of most of its\r\nmembers.(183) Mr. Chamberlain, who was destined to play so singular and\r\nversatile a part in the eventful years to come, entered the cabinet with\r\nreluctance and misgiving. The Admiralty was first proposed to him and was\r\ndeclined, partly on the ground that the chief of the fighting and spending\r\ndepartments was not the post for one who had just given to domestic\r\nreforms the paramount place in his stirring addresses to (M107) the\r\ncountry. Mr. Chamberlain, we may be sure, was not much concerned about the\r\nparticular office. Whatever its place in the hierarchy, he knew that he\r\ncould trust himself to make it as important as he pleased, and that his\r\nweight in the cabinet and the House would not depend upon the accident of\r\na department. Nobody’s position was so difficult. He was well aware how\r\nserious a thing it would be for his prospects, if he were to join a\r\nconfederacy of his arch enemies, the whigs, against Mr. Gladstone, the\r\ncommanding idol of his friends, the radicals. If, on the other hand, by\r\nrefusing to enter the government he should either prevent its formation or\r\nshould cause its speedy overthrow, he would be left planted with a\r\ncomparatively ineffective group of his own, and he would incur the deep\r\nresentment of the bulk of those with whom he had hitherto been accustomed\r\nto act.\r\n\r\nAll these were legitimate considerations in the mind of a man with the\r\ninstinct of party management. In the end he joined his former chief. He\r\nmade no concealment of his position. He warned the prime minister that he\r\ndid not believe it to be possible to reconcile conditions as to the\r\nsecurity of the empire and the supremacy of parliament, with the\r\nestablishment of a legislative body in Dublin. He declared his own\r\npreference for an attempt to come to terms with the Irish members on the\r\nbasis of a more limited scheme of local government, coupled with proposals\r\nabout land and about education. At the same time, as the minister had been\r\ngood enough to leave him unlimited liberty of judgment and rejection, he\r\nwas ready to give unprejudiced examination to more extensive\r\nproposals.(184) Such was Mr. Chamberlain’s excuse for joining. It is\r\nhardly so intelligible as Lord Hartington’s reasons for not joining. For\r\nthe new government could only subsist by Irish support. That support\r\nnotoriously depended on the concession of more than a limited scheme of\r\nlocal government. The administration would have been overthrown in a week,\r\nand to form a cabinet on such a basis as was here proposed would be the\r\nidlest experiment that ever was tried.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of the writer of these pages to be Irish secretary was at\r\nonce generally regarded as decisive of Mr. Gladstone’s ultimate intention,\r\nfor during the election and afterwards I had spoken strongly in favour of\r\na colonial type of government for Ireland. It was rightly pressed upon Mr.\r\nGladstone by at least one of his most experienced advisers, that such an\r\nappointment to this particular office would be construed as a declaration\r\nin favour of an Irish parliament, without any further examination at\r\nall.(185) And so, in fact, it was generally construed.\r\n\r\nNobody was more active in aiding the formation of the new ministry than\r\nSir William Harcourt, in whose powerful composition loyalty to party and\r\nconviction of the value of party have ever been indestructible instincts.\r\n“I must not let the week absolutely close,” Mr. Gladstone wrote to him\r\nfrom Mentmore (February 6), “without emphatically thanking you for the\r\nindefatigable and effective help which you have rendered to me during its\r\ncourse, in the difficult work now nearly accomplished.”\r\n\r\nAt the close of the operation, he writes from Downing Street to his son\r\nHenry, then in India:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _February 12, 1886._ You see the old date has reappeared at the\r\n    head of my letter. The work last week was extremely hard from the\r\n    mixture of political discussions on the Irish question, by way of\r\n    preliminary condition, with the ordinary distribution of offices,\r\n    which while it lasts is of itself difficult enough.\r\n\r\n    Upon the whole I am well satisfied with its composition. It is not\r\n    a bit more radical than the government of last year; perhaps a\r\n    little less. And we have got some good young hands, which please\r\n    me very much. Yet short as the Salisbury government has been, it\r\n    would not at all surprise me if this were to be shorter still,\r\n    such are the difficulties that bristle round the Irish question.\r\n    But the great thing is to be right; and as far as matters have yet\r\n    advanced, I see no reason to be apprehensive in this capital\r\n    respect. I have framed a plan for the land and for the finance of\r\n    what must be a very large transaction. It is necessary to see our\r\n    way a little on these at the outset, for, unless these portions of\r\n    anything we attempt are sound and well constructed, we cannot hope\r\n    to succeed. On the other hand, if we fail, as I believe the late\r\n    ministers would have failed even to pass their plan of repressive\r\n    legislation, the consequences will be deplorable in every way.\r\n    There seems to be no doubt that some, and notably Lord R.\r\n    Churchill, fully reckoned on my failing to form a government.(186)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe work pressed, and time was terribly short. The new ministers had\r\nbarely gone through their re-elections before the opposition began to\r\nharry them for their policy, and went so far, before the government was\r\nfive weeks old, as to make the extreme motion for refusing supply. Even if\r\nthe opposition had been in more modest humour, no considerable delay could\r\nbe defended. Social order in Ireland was in a profoundly unsatisfactory\r\nphase. That fact was the starting-point of the reversal of policy which\r\nthe government had come into existence to carry out. You cannot announce a\r\ngrand revolution, and then beg the world to wait. The very reason that\r\njustified the policy commanded expedition. Anxiety and excitement were too\r\nintense out of doors for anything but a speedy date, and it was quite\r\ncertain that if the new plan were not at once propounded, no other public\r\nbusiness would have much chance.\r\n\r\nThe new administration did not meet parliament until after the middle of\r\nFebruary, and the two Irish bills, in which their policy was contained,\r\nwere ready by the end of the first week of April. Considering the enormous\r\nbreadth and intricacy of the subjects, the pressure of parliamentary\r\nbusiness all the time, the exigencies of administrative work in the case\r\nof at least one of the ministers principally concerned, and the\r\ndistracting atmosphere of party perturbation and disquiet that daily and\r\nhourly harassed the work, the despatch of such a task within such limits\r\nof time was at least not discreditable to the industry and concentration\r\nof those who achieved it. I leave it still open to the hostile critic to\r\nsay, as Molière’s Alceste says of the sonnet composed in a quarter of an\r\nhour, that time has nothing to do with the business.\r\n\r\nAll through March Mr. Gladstone laboured in what he called “stiff\r\nconclaves” about finance and land, attended drawing rooms, and “observed\r\nthe variations of H.M.’s _accueils_”; had an audience of the Queen, “very\r\ngracious, but avoided serious subjects”; was laid up with cold, and the\r\nweather made Sir Andrew Clark strict; then rose up to fresh grapples with\r\nfinance and land and untoward colleagues, and all the “inexorable demands\r\nof my political vocation.” His patience and self-control were as\r\nmarvellous as his tireless industry. Sorely tried by something or another\r\nat a cabinet, he enters,—“Angry with myself for not bearing it better. I\r\nought to have been thankful for it all the time.” On a similar occasion, a\r\njunior colleague showed himself less thankful than he should have been for\r\npurposeless antagonism. “Think of it as discipline,” said Mr. (M108)\r\nGladstone. “But why,” said the unregenerate junior, “should we grudge the\r\nblessings of discipline to some other people?”\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone was often blamed even by Laodiceans among his supporters,\r\nnot wise but foolish after the event, because he did not proceed by way of\r\nresolution, instead of by bill. Resolutions, it was argued, would have\r\nsmoothed the way. General propositions would have found readier access to\r\nmen’s minds. Having accepted the general proposition, people would have\r\nfound it harder to resist the particular application. Devices that\r\nstartled in the precision of a clause, would in the vagueness of a broad\r\nand abstract principle have soothed and persuaded. Mr. Gladstone was\r\nperfectly alive to all this, but his answer to it was plain. Those who\r\neventually threw out the bill would insist on unmasking the resolution.\r\nThey would have exhausted all the stereotyped vituperation of abstract\r\nmotions. They would have ridiculed any general proposition as mere\r\nplatitude, and pertinaciously clamoured for working details. What would\r\nthe resolution have affirmed? The expediency of setting up a legislative\r\nauthority in Ireland to deal with exclusively Irish affairs. But such a\r\nresolution would be consistent equally with a narrow scheme on the one\r\nhand, such as a plan for national councils, and a broad scheme on the\r\nother, giving to Ireland a separate exchequer, separate control over\r\ncustoms and excise, and practically an independent and co-ordinate\r\nlegislature.(187) How could the government meet the challenge to say\r\noutright whether they intended broad or narrow? Such a resolution could\r\nhardly have outlived an evening’s debate, and would not have postponed the\r\nevil day of schism for a single week.\r\n\r\nPrecedents lent no support. It is true that the way was prepared for the\r\nAct of Union in the parliament of Great Britain, by the string of\r\nresolutions moved by Mr. Pitt in the beginning of 1799. But anybody who\r\nglances at them, will at once perceive that if resolutions on their model\r\nhad been framed for the occasion of 1886, they would have covered the\r\nwhole ground of the actual bill, and would instantly have raised all the\r\nformidable objections and difficulties exactly as the bill itself raised\r\nthem. The Bank Charter Act of 1833 was founded on eight resolutions, and\r\nthey also set forth in detail the points of the ministerial plan.(188) The\r\nrenewal of the East India Company’s charter in the same year went on by\r\nway of resolutions, less abundant in particulars than the Bank Act, but\r\npreceded by correspondence and papers which had been exhaustively\r\ncanvassed and discussed.(189) The question of Irish autonomy was in no\r\nposition of that sort.\r\n\r\nThe most apt precedent in some respects is to be found on a glorious\r\noccasion, also in the year 1833. Mr. Stanley introduced the proposals of\r\nhis government for the emancipation of the West Indian slaves in five\r\nresolutions. They furnished a key not only to policy and general\r\nprinciples, but also to the plan by which these were to be carried\r\nout.(190) Lord Howick followed the minister at once, raising directly the\r\nwhole question of the plan. Who could doubt that Lord Hartington would now\r\ntake precisely the same course towards Irish resolutions of similar scope?\r\nThe procedure on the India bill of 1858 was just as little to the point.\r\nThe general disposition of the House was wholly friendly to a settlement\r\nof the question of Indian government by the existing ministry. No single\r\nsection of the opposition wished to take it out of their hands, for\r\nneither Lord Russell nor the Peelites nor the Manchester men, and probably\r\nnot even Lord Palmerston himself, were anxious for the immediate return of\r\nthe last-named minister to power. Who will pretend that in the House, of\r\nCommons in February 1886, anything at all like the same state of facts\r\nprevailed? As for the resolutions in the case of the Irish church, they\r\nwere moved by Mr. Gladstone in opposition, and he thought it obvious that\r\na policy proposed in opposition stands on a totally different footing from\r\na policy laid before parliament on the responsibility of a government, and\r\na government bound by every necessity of the situation to prompt\r\naction.(191)\r\n\r\n(M109) At a later stage, as we shall see, it was actually proposed that a\r\nvote for the second reading of the bill should be taken to mean no more\r\nthan a vote for its principle. Every one of the objections that instantly\r\nsprang out of their ambush against this proposal would have worked just as\r\nmuch mischief against an initial resolution. In short, in opening a policy\r\nof this difficulty and extent, the cabinet was bound to produce to\r\nparliament not merely its policy but its plan for carrying the policy out.\r\nBy that course only could parliament know what it was doing. Any other\r\ncourse must have ended in a mystifying, irritating, and barren confusion,\r\nalike in the House of Commons and in the country.(192)\r\n\r\nThe same consideration that made procedure by resolution unadvisable told\r\nwith equal force within the cabinet. Examination into the feasibility of\r\nsome sort of plan was most rapidly brought to a head by the test of a\r\nparticular plan. It is a mere fable of faction that a cast iron policy was\r\narbitrarily imposed upon the cabinet; as matter of fact, the plan\r\noriginally propounded did undergo large and radical modifications.\r\n\r\nThe policy as a whole shaped itself in two measures. First, a scheme for\r\ncreating a legislative body, and defining its powers; second, a scheme for\r\nopening the way to a settlement of the land question, in discharge of an\r\nobligation of honour and policy, imposed upon this country by its active\r\nshare in all the mischiefs that the Irish land system had produced. The\r\nintroduction of a plan for dealing with the land was not very popular even\r\namong ministers, but it was pressed by Lord Spencer and the Irish\r\nsecretary, on the double ground that the land was too burning a question\r\nto be left where it then stood, and next that it was unfair to a new and\r\nuntried legislature in Ireland to find itself confronted by such a\r\nquestion on the very threshold.\r\n\r\nThe plan was opened by Mr. Gladstone in cabinet on March 13th, and Mr.\r\nChamberlain and Mr. Trevelyan at once wished to resign. He remonstrated in\r\na vigorous correspondence. “I have seen many and many a resignation,” he\r\nsaid, “but never one based upon the intentions, nay the immature\r\nintentions, of the prime minister, and on a pure intuition of what may\r\nhappen. Bricks and rafters are prepared for a house, but are not\r\nthemselves a house.” The evil hour was postponed, but not for long. The\r\nCabinet met again a few days later (March 26) and things came to a sharp\r\nissue. The question was raised in a sufficiently definite form by the\r\nproposition from the prime minister for the establishment of a statutory\r\nbody sitting in Dublin with legislative powers. No difficulty was made\r\nabout the bare proposition itself. Every one seemed to go as far as that.\r\nIt needed to be tested, and tests were at once forthcoming. Mr. Trevelyan\r\ncould not assent to the control of the immediate machinery of law and\r\norder being withdrawn from direct British authority, among other reasons\r\nbecause it was this proposal that created the necessity for buying out the\r\nIrish landlords, which he regarded as raising a problem absolutely\r\ninsoluble.(193) Mr. Chamberlain raised four points. He objected to the\r\ncesser of Irish representation; he could not consent to the grant of full\r\nrights of taxation to Ireland; he resisted the surrender of the\r\nappointment of judges and magistrates; and he argued strongly against\r\nproceeding by enumeration of the things that an Irish government might not\r\ndo, instead of by a specific delegation of the things that it might\r\ndo.(194) That these four objections were not in themselves incapable of\r\naccommodation was shown by subsequent events. The second was very\r\nspeedily, and the first was ultimately allowed, while the fourth was held\r\nby good authority to be little more than a question of drafting. Even the\r\nthird was not a point either way on which to break up a government,\r\ndestroy a policy, and split a party. But everybody who is acquainted with\r\neither the great or the small conflicts of human history, knows how little\r\nthe mere terms of a principle or of an objection are to be trusted as a\r\nclue either to its practical significance, or (M110) to the design with\r\nwhich it is in reality advanced. The design here under all the four heads\r\nof objection, was the dwarfing of the legislative body, the cramping and\r\nconstriction of its organs, its reduction to something which the Irish\r\ncould not have even pretended to accept, and which they would have been no\r\nbetter than fools if they had ever attempted to work.\r\n\r\nSome supposed then, and Mr. Chamberlain has said since, that when he\r\nentered the cabinet room on this memorable occasion, he intended to be\r\nconciliatory. Witnesses of the scene thought that the prime minister made\r\nlittle attempt in that direction. Yet where two men of clear mind and firm\r\nwill mean two essentially different things under the same name, whether\r\nautonomy or anything else, and each intends to stand by his own\r\ninterpretation, it is childish to suppose that arts of deportment will\r\nsmother or attenuate fundamental divergence, or make people who are quite\r\naware how vitally they differ, pretend that they entirely agree. Mr.\r\nGladstone knew the giant burden that he had taken up, and when he went to\r\nthe cabinet of March 26, his mind was no doubt fixed that success, so\r\nhazardous at best, would be hopeless in face of personal antagonisms and\r\nbitterly divided counsels. This, in his view, and in his own phrase, was\r\none of the “great imperial occasions” that call for imperial resolves. The\r\ntwo ministers accordingly resigned.\r\n\r\nBesides these two important secessions, some ministers out of the cabinet\r\nresigned, but they were of the whig complexion.(195) The new prospect of\r\nthe whig schism extending into the camp of the extreme radicals created\r\nnatural alarm but hardly produced a panic. So deep were the roots of\r\nparty, so immense the authority of a veteran leader. It used to be said of\r\nthe administration of 1880, that the world would never really know Mr.\r\nGladstone’s strength in parliament and the country, until every one of his\r\ncolleagues had in turn abandoned him to his own resources. Certainly the\r\nsecessions of the end of March 1886 left him undaunted. Every\r\nconsideration of duty and of policy bound him to persevere. He felt,\r\njustly enough, that a minister who had once deliberately invited his party\r\nand the people of the three kingdoms to follow him on so arduous and bold\r\na march as this, had no right on any common plea to turn back until he had\r\nexhausted every available device to “bring the army of the faithful\r\nthrough.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the first the Irish leader was in free and constant communication\r\nwith the chief secretary. Proposals were once or twice made, not I think\r\nat Mr. Parnell’s desire, for conversations to be held between Mr.\r\nGladstone and himself, but they were always discouraged by Mr. Gladstone,\r\nwho was never fond of direct personal contentions, or conversations when\r\nthe purpose could be as well served otherwise, and he had a horror of what\r\nhe called multiplying channels of communication. “For the moment,” he\r\nreplied, “I think we may look to Mr. M. alone, and rely on all he says for\r\naccuracy as well as fidelity. I have been hard at work, and to-day I mean\r\nto have a further and full talk with Mr. M., who will probably soon after\r\nwish for some renewed conversation with Mr. Parnell.” Mr. Parnell showed\r\nhimself acute, frank, patient, closely attentive, and possessed of\r\nstriking though not rapid insight. He never slurred over difficulties, nor\r\ntried to pretend that rough was smooth. On the other hand, he had nothing\r\nin common with that desperate species of counsellor, who takes all the\r\nsmall points, and raises objections instead of helping to contrive\r\nexpedients. He measured the ground with a slow and careful eye, and fixed\r\ntenaciously on the thing that was essential at the moment. Of constructive\r\nfaculty he never showed a trace. He was a man of temperament, of will, of\r\nauthority, of power; not of ideas or ideals, or knowledge, or political\r\nmaxims, or even of the practical reason in any of its higher senses, as\r\nHamilton, Madison, and Jefferson had practical reason. But he knew what he\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n(M111) He was always perfectly ready at this period to acquiesce in Irish\r\nexclusion from Westminster, on the ground that they would want all the\r\nbrains they had for their own parliament. At the same time he would have\r\nliked a provision for sending a delegation to Westminster on occasion,\r\nwith reference to some definite Irish questions such as might be expected\r\nto arise. As to the composition of the upper or protective order in the\r\nIrish parliament, he was wholly unfamiliar with the various utopian plans\r\nthat have been advanced for the protection of minorities, and he declared\r\nhimself tolerably indifferent whether the object should be sought in\r\nnomination by the crown, or through a special and narrower elective body,\r\nor by any other scheme. To such things he had given no thought. He was a\r\nparty chief, not a maker of constitutions. He liked the idea of both\r\norders sitting in one House. He made one significant suggestion: he wished\r\nthe bill to impose the same disqualification upon the clergy as exists in\r\nour own parliament. But he would have liked to see certain ecclesiastical\r\ndignitaries included by virtue of their office in the upper or protective\r\nbranch. All questions of this kind, however, interested him much less than\r\nfinance. Into financial issues he threw himself with extraordinary energy,\r\nand he fought for better terms with a keenness and tenacity that almost\r\nbaffled the mighty expert with whom he was matched. They only met once\r\nduring the weeks of the preparation of the bill, though the indirect\r\ncommunication was constant. Here is my scanty note of the meeting:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _April 5._—Mr. Parnell came to my room at the House at 8.30, and\r\n    we talked for two hours. At 10.30 I went to Mr. Gladstone next\r\n    door, and told him how things stood. He asked me to open the\r\n    points of discussion, and into my room we went. He shook hands\r\n    cordially with Mr. Parnell, and sat down between him and me. We at\r\n    once got to work. P. extraordinarily close, tenacious, and sharp.\r\n    It was all finance. At midnight, Mr. Gladstone rose in his chair\r\n    and said, “I fear I must go; I cannot sit as late as I used to\r\n    do.” “Very clever, very clever,” he muttered to me as I held open\r\n    the door of his room for him. I returned to Parnell, who went on\r\n    repeating his points in his impenetrable way, until the policeman\r\n    mercifully came to say the House was up.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone’s own note must also be transcribed:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _April 5._—Wrote to Lord Spencer. The Queen and ministers. Four\r\n    hours on the matter for my speech. 1-½ hours with Welby and\r\n    Hamilton on the figures. Saw Lord Spencer, Mr. Morley, Mr. A. M.\r\n    H. of C., 5-8. Dined at Sir Thomas May’s.\r\n\r\n    1-½ hours with Morley and Parnell on the root of the matter;\r\n    rather too late for me, 10-½-12. A hard day. (_Diary._)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn more than one financial point the conflict went perilously near to\r\nbreaking down the whole operation. “If we do not get a right budget,” said\r\nMr. Parnell, “all will go wrong from the very first hour.” To the last he\r\nheld out that the just proportion of Irish contribution to the imperial\r\nfund was not one-fourteenth or one-fifteenth, but a twentieth or\r\ntwenty-first part. He insisted all the more strongly on his own more\r\nliberal fraction, as a partial compensation for their surrender of fiscal\r\nliberty and the right to impose customs duties. Even an hour or two before\r\nthe bill was actually to be unfolded to the House, he hurried to the Irish\r\noffice in what was for him rather an excited state, to make one more\r\nappeal to me for his fraction. It is not at all improbable that if the\r\nbill had gone forward into committee, it would have been at the eleventh\r\nhour rejected by the Irish on this department of it, and then all would\r\nhave been at an end. Mr. Parnell never concealed this danger ahead.\r\n\r\nIn the cabinet things went forward with such ups and downs as are usual\r\nwhen a difficult bill is on the anvil. In a project of this magnitude, it\r\nwas inevitable that some minister should occasionally let fall the\r\nconsecrated formula that if this or that were done or not done, he must\r\nreconsider his position. Financial arrangements, and the protection of the\r\nminority, were two of the knottiest points,—the first from the contention\r\nraised on the Irish side, the second from misgiving in some minds as to\r\nthe possibility of satisfying protestant sentiment in England and\r\nScotland. Some kept the colonial type more strongly in view than others,\r\nand the bill no doubt ultimately bore that cast.\r\n\r\n(M112) The draft project of surrendering complete taxing-power to the\r\nIrish legislative body was eventually abandoned. It was soon felt that the\r\nbare possibility of Ireland putting duties on British goods—and it was not\r\nmore than a bare possibility in view of Britain’s position as practically\r\nIreland’s only market—would have destroyed the bill in every manufacturing\r\nand commercial centre in the land. Mr. Parnell agreed to give up the\r\ncontrol of customs, and also to give up direct and continuous\r\nrepresentation at Westminster. On this cardinal point of the cesser of\r\nIrish representation, Mr. Gladstone to the last professed to keep an open\r\nmind, though to most of the cabinet, including especially three of its\r\noldest hands and coolest heads, exclusion was at this time almost vital.\r\nExclusion was favoured not only on its merits. Mr. Bright was known to\r\nregard it as large compensation for what otherwise he viewed as pure\r\nmischief, and it was expected to win support in other quarters generally\r\nhostile. So in truth it did, but at the cost of support in quarters that\r\nwere friendly. On April 30, Mr. Gladstone wrote to Lord Granville, “I\r\nscarcely see how a cabinet could have been formed, if the inclusion of the\r\nIrish members had been insisted on; and now I do not see how the scheme\r\nand policy can be saved from shipwreck, if the exclusion is insisted on.”\r\n\r\nThe plan was bound to be extensive, as its objects were extensive, and it\r\ntook for granted in the case of Ireland the fundamental probabilities of\r\ncivil society. He who looks with “indolent and kingly gaze” upon all\r\nprojects of written constitutions need not turn to the Appendix unless he\r\nwill. Two features of the plan were cardinal.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the scheme was the establishment in Ireland of a\r\ndomestic legislature to deal with Irish as distinguished from imperial\r\naffairs. It followed from this that if Irish members and representative\r\npeers remained at Westminster at all, though they might claim a share in\r\nthe settlement of imperial affairs, they could not rightly control English\r\nor Scotch affairs. This was from the first, and has ever since remained,\r\nthe Gordian knot. The cabinet on a review of all the courses open\r\ndetermined to propose the plan of total exclusion, save and unless for the\r\npurpose of revising this organic statute.\r\n\r\nThe next question was neither so hard nor so vital. Ought the powers of\r\nthe Irish legislature to be specifically enumerated? Or was it better to\r\nenumerate the branches of legislation from which the statutory parliament\r\nwas to be shut out? Should we enact the things that they might do, or the\r\nthings that they might not do, leaving them the whole residue of\r\nlaw-making power outside of these exceptions and exclusions? The latter\r\nwas the plan adopted in the bill. Disabilities were specified, and\r\neverything not so specified was left within the scope of the Irish\r\nauthority. These disabilities comprehended all matters affecting the\r\ncrown. All questions of defence and armed force were shut out; all foreign\r\nand colonial relations; the law of trade and navigation, of coinage and\r\nlegal tender. The new legislature could not meddle with certain charters,\r\nnor with certain contracts, nor could it establish or endow any particular\r\nreligion.(196)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong his five spurious types of courage, Aristotle names for one the man\r\nwho seems to be brave, only because he does not see his danger. This, at\r\nleast, was not Mr. Gladstone’s case. No one knew better than the leader in\r\nthe enterprise, how formidable were the difficulties that lay in his path.\r\nThe giant mass of secular English prejudice against Ireland frowned like a\r\nmountain chain across the track. A strong and proud nation had trained\r\nitself for long courses of time in habits of dislike for the history, the\r\npolitical claims, the religion, the temperament, of a weaker nation. The\r\nviolence of the Irish members in the last parliament, sporadic barbarities\r\nin some of the wilder portions of the island, the hideous murders in the\r\nPark, had all deepened and vivified the scowling impressions nursed by\r\nlarge bodies of Englishmen for many ages past about unfortunate Ireland.\r\nThen the practical operation of shaping an Irish constitution, whether on\r\ncolonial, federal, or any (M113) other lines, was in itself a task that,\r\neven if all external circumstance had been as smiling as it was in fact\r\nthe opposite, still abounded in every kind of knotty, intricate, and\r\nintractable matter.\r\n\r\nIt is true that elements could be discovered on the other side. First, was\r\nMr. Gladstone’s own high place in the confidence of great masses of his\r\ncountrymen, the result of a lifetime of conspicuous service and\r\nachievement. Next, the lacerating struggle with Ireland ever since 1880,\r\nand the confusion into which it had brought our affairs, had bred\r\nsomething like despair in many minds, and they were ready to look in\r\nalmost any direction for relief from an intolerable burden. Third, the\r\ncontroversy had not gone very far before opponents were astounded to find\r\nthat the new policy, which they angrily scouted as half insanity and half\r\ntreason, gave comparatively little shock to the new democracy. This was at\r\nfirst imputed to mere ignorance and raw habits of political judgment.\r\nWider reflection might have warned them that the plain people of this\r\nisland, though quickly roused against even the shadow of concession when\r\nthe power or the greatness of their country is openly assailed, seem at\r\nthe same time ready to turn to moral claims of fair play, of conciliation,\r\nof pacific truce. With all these magnanimous sentiments the Irish case was\r\nonly too easily made to associate itself. The results of the Irish\r\nelections and the force of the constitutional demand sank deep in the\r\npopular mind. The grim spectre of Coercion as the other alternative wore\r\nits most repulsive look in the eyes of men, themselves but newly admitted\r\nto full citizenship. Rash experiment in politics has been defined as\r\nraising grave issues without grave cause. Nobody of any party denied in\r\nthis crisis the gravity of the cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI. Introduction Of The Bill. (1886)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Much have I seen and known; cities of men\r\n    And manners, climates, councils, governments,\r\n    Myself not least, but honour’d of them all....\r\n    There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail;\r\n    There gloom the dark broad seas.\r\n                    —TENNYSON, _Ulysses_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not within the compass either of human effort or human endurance\r\neven for the most practised and skilful of orators to unfold the whole\r\nplan, both government and land, in a single speech. Nor was public\r\ninterest at all equally divided. Irish land had devoured an immense amount\r\nof parliamentary time in late years; it is one of the most technical and\r\nrepulsive of all political subjects; and to many of the warmest friends of\r\nIrish self-government, any special consideration for the owners of Irish\r\nland was bitterly unpalatable. Expectation was centred upon the plan for\r\ngeneral government. This was introduced on April 8. Here is the entry in\r\nthe little diary:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The message came to me this morning: “Hold thou up my goings in\r\n    thy path, that my footsteps slip not.” Settled finally my figures\r\n    with Welby and Hamilton; other points with Spencer and Morley.\r\n    Reflected much. Took a short drive. H. of C., 4-½-8-¼.\r\n    Extraordinary scenes outside the House and in. My speech, which I\r\n    have sometimes thought could never end, lasted nearly 3-½ hours.\r\n    Voice and strength and freedom were granted to me in a degree\r\n    beyond what I could have hoped. But many a prayer had gone up for\r\n    me, and not I believe in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo such scene had ever been beheld in the House of Commons. Members came\r\ndown at break of day to secure their places; before noon every seat was\r\nmarked, and (M114) crowded benches were even arrayed on the floor of the\r\nHouse from the mace to the bar. Princes, ambassadors, great peers, high\r\nprelates, thronged the lobbies. The fame of the orator, the boldness of\r\nhis exploit, curiosity as to the plan, poignant anxiety as to the party\r\nresult, wonder whether a wizard had at last actually arisen with a spell\r\nfor casting out the baleful spirits that had for so many ages made Ireland\r\nour torment and our dishonour, all these things brought together such an\r\nassemblage as no minister before had ever addressed within those\r\nworld-renowned walls. The parliament was new. Many of its members had\r\nfought a hard battle for their seats, and trusted they were safe in the\r\nhaven for half a dozen good years to come. Those who were moved by\r\nprofessional ambition, those whose object was social advancement, those\r\nwho thought only of upright public service, the keen party men, the men\r\nwho aspired to office, the men with a past and the men who looked for a\r\nfuture, all alike found themselves adrift on dark and troubled waters. The\r\nsecrets of the bill had been well kept. To-day the disquieted host were\r\nfirst to learn what was the great project to which they would have to say\r\nthat Aye or No on which for them and for the state so much would hang.\r\n\r\nOf the chief comrades or rivals of the minister’s own generation, the\r\nstrong administrators, the eager and accomplished debaters, the sagacious\r\nleaders, the only survivor now comparable to him in eloquence or in\r\ninfluence was Mr. Bright. That illustrious man seldom came into the House\r\nin those distracted days; and on this memorable occasion his stern and\r\nnoble head was to be seen in dim obscurity. Various as were the emotions\r\nin other regions of the House, in one quarter rejoicing was unmixed.\r\nThere, at least, was no doubt and no misgiving. There pallid and tranquil\r\nsat the Irish leader, whose hard insight, whose patience, energy, and\r\nspirit of command, had achieved this astounding result, and done that\r\nwhich he had vowed to his countrymen that he would assuredly be able to\r\ndo. On the benches round him, genial excitement rose almost to tumult.\r\nWell it might. For the first time since the union, the Irish case was at\r\nlast to be pressed in all its force and strength, in every aspect of\r\npolicy and of conscience, by the most powerful Englishman then alive.\r\n\r\nMore striking than the audience was the man; more striking than the\r\nmultitude of eager onlookers from the shore was the rescuer with\r\ndeliberate valour facing the floods ready to wash him down; the veteran\r\nUlysses, who after more than half a century of combat, service, toil,\r\nthought it not too late to try a further “work of noble note.” In the\r\nhands of such a master of the instrument, the theme might easily have lent\r\nitself to one of those displays of exalted passion which the House had\r\nmarvelled at in more than one of Mr. Gladstone’s speeches on the Turkish\r\nquestion, or heard with religious reverence in his speech on the\r\nAffirmation bill in 1883. What the occasion now required was that passion\r\nshould burn low, and reasoned persuasion hold up the guiding lamp. An\r\nelaborate scheme was to be unfolded, an unfamiliar policy to be explained\r\nand vindicated. Of that best kind of eloquence which dispenses with\r\ndeclamation, this was a fine and sustained example. There was a deep,\r\nrapid, steady, onflowing volume of argument, exposition, exhortation.\r\nEvery hard or bitter stroke was avoided. Now and again a fervid note\r\nthrilled the ear and lifted all hearts. But political oratory is action,\r\nnot words,—action, character, will, conviction, purpose, personality. As\r\nthis eager muster of men underwent the enchantment of periods exquisite in\r\ntheir balance and modulation, the compulsion of his flashing glance and\r\nanimated gesture, what stirred and commanded them was the recollection of\r\nnational service, the thought of the speaker’s mastering purpose, his\r\nunflagging resolution and strenuous will, his strength of thew and sinew\r\nwell tried in long years of resounding war, his unquenched conviction that\r\nthe just cause can never fail. Few are the heroic moments in our\r\nparliamentary politics, but this was one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first reading of the bill was allowed to pass without a division. To\r\nthe second, Lord Hartington moved an (M115) amendment in the ordinary form\r\nof simple rejection.(197) His two speeches(198) present the case against\r\nthe policy and the bill in its most massive form. The direct and\r\nunsophisticated nature of his antagonism, backed by a personal character\r\nof uprightness and plain dealing beyond all suspicion, gave a momentum to\r\nhis attack that was beyond any effect of dialectics. It was noticed that\r\nhe had never during his thirty years of parliamentary life spoken with\r\nanything like the same power before. The debates on the two stages\r\noccupied sixteen nights. They were not unworthy of the gravity of the\r\nissue, nor of the fame of the House of Commons. Only one speaker held the\r\nmagic secret of Demosthenic oratory. Several others showed themselves\r\nmasters of the higher arts of parliamentary discussion. One or two\r\ntransient spurts of fire in the encounters of orange and green, served to\r\nreveal the intensity of the glow behind the closed doors of the furnace.\r\nBut the general temper was good. The rule against irritating language was\r\nhardly ever broken. Swords crossed according to the strict rules of\r\ncombat. The tone was rational and argumentative. There was plenty of\r\nstrong, close, and acute reasoning; there was some learning, a\r\nconsiderable acquaintance both with historic and contemporary, foreign and\r\ndomestic fact, and when fact and reasoning broke down, their place was\r\nabundantly filled by eloquent prophecy of disaster on one side, or\r\nblessing on the other. Neither prophecy was demonstrable; both could be\r\nmade plausible.\r\n\r\nDiscussion was adorned by copious references to the mighty shades who had\r\nbeen the glory of the House in a great parliamentary age. We heard again\r\nthe Virgilian hexameters in which Pitt had described the spirit of his\r\npolicy at the union:—\r\n\r\n\r\n              “Paribus se legibus ambæ\r\n    Invictæ gentes æterna in fœdera mittant.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWe heard once more how Grattan said that union of the legislatures was\r\nseverance of the nations; that the ocean forbade union, the channel\r\nforbade separation; that England in her government of Ireland had gone to\r\nhell for her principles and to bedlam for her discretion. There was, above\r\nall, a grand and copious anthology throughout the debate from Burke, the\r\ngreatest of Irishmen and the largest master of civil wisdom in our tongue.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of a certain measure of the common form of all debates was\r\ninevitable. No bill is ever brought in of which its opponents do not say\r\nthat it either goes too far, or else it does not go far enough; no bill of\r\nwhich its defenders do not say as to some crucial flaw pounced upon and\r\nparaded by the enemy, that after all it is a mere question of drafting, or\r\ncan be more appropriately discussed in committee. There was the usual\r\nevasion of the strong points of the adversary’s case, the usual\r\nexaggeration of its weak ones. That is debating. Perorations ran in a\r\nmonotonous mould; integrity of the empire on one side, a real, happy, and\r\nindissoluble reconciliation between English and Irish on the other.\r\n\r\nOne side dwelt much on the recall of Lord Fitzwilliam in 1795, and the\r\nsqualid corruption of the union; the other, on the hopeless distraction\r\nleft by the rebellion of 1798, and the impotent confusion of the Irish\r\nparliament. One speaker enumerated Mr. Pitt’s arguments for the union—the\r\nargument about the regency and about the commercial treaty, the argument\r\nabout foreign alliances and confederacies and the army, about free trade\r\nand catholic emancipation; he showed that under all these six heads the\r\nnew bill carefully respected and guarded the grounds taken by the minister\r\nof the union. He was bluntly answered by the exclamation that nobody cared\r\na straw about what Mr. Pitt said, or what Sir Ralph Abercromby said; what\r\nwe had to deal with were the facts of the case in the year 1886. You show\r\nyour mistrust of the Irish by inserting all these safeguards in the bill,\r\nsaid the opposition. No, replied ministers; the safeguards are to meet no\r\nmistrusts of ours, but those entertained or feigned by other people. You\r\nhad no mandate for home rule, said the opposition. Still less, ministers\r\nretorted, had you a mandate for coercion. (M116) Such a scheme as this,\r\nexclaimed the critics, with all its checks and counterchecks, its\r\ntruncated functions, its vetoes, exceptions, and reservations, is\r\ndegrading to Ireland, and every Irish patriot with a spark of spirit in\r\nhis bosom must feel it so. As if, retorted the defenders, there were no\r\ndegradation to a free people in suffering twenty years of your firm and\r\nresolute coercion. One side argued that the interests of Ireland and Great\r\nBritain were much too closely intertwined to permit a double legislature.\r\nThe other argued that this very interdependence was just what made an\r\nIrish legislature safe, because it was incredible that they should act as\r\nif they had no benefit to receive from us, and no injury to suffer from\r\ninjury inflicted upon us. Do you, asked some, blot out of your minds the\r\nbitter, incendiary, and rebellious speech of Irish members? But do you\r\nthen, the rejoinder followed, suppose that the language that came from\r\nmen’s hearts when a boon was refused, is a clue to the sentiment in their\r\nhearts when the boon shall have been granted? Ministers were bombarded\r\nwith reproachful quotations from their old speeches. They answered the\r\nfire by taunts about the dropping of coercion, and the amazing manœuvres\r\nof the autumn of 1885. The device of the two orders was denounced as\r\ninconsistent with the democratic tendencies of the age. A very impressive\r\nargument forsooth from you, was the reply, who are either stout defenders\r\nof the House of Lords as it is, or else stout advocates for some of the\r\nmultifarious schemes for mixing hereditary peers with fossil officials,\r\nall of them equally alien to the democratic tendencies whether of this age\r\nor any other. So, with stroke and counter-stroke, was the ball kept\r\nflying.\r\n\r\nMuch was made of foreign and colonial analogies; of the union between\r\nAustria and Hungary, Norway and Sweden, Denmark and Iceland; how in\r\nforcing legislative union on North America we lost the colonies; how the\r\nunion of legislatures ended in the severance of Holland from Belgium. All\r\nthis carried little conviction. Most members of parliament like to think\r\nwith pretty large blinkers on, and though it may make for narrowness, this\r\nis consistent with much practical wisdom. Historical parallels in the\r\nactual politics of the day are usually rather decorative than substantial.\r\n\r\nIf people disbelieve premisses, nothing can be easier than to ridicule\r\nconclusions; and what happened now was that critics argued against this or\r\nthat contrivance in the machinery, because they insisted that no machinery\r\nwas needed at all, and that no contrivance could ever be made to work,\r\nbecause the Irish mechanicians would infallibly devote all their\r\ninfatuated energy and perverse skill, not to work it, but to break it in\r\npieces. The Irish, in Mr. Gladstone’s ironical paraphrase of these\r\nsingular opinions, had a double dose of original sin; they belonged wholly\r\nto the kingdoms of darkness, and therefore the rules of that probability\r\nwhich wise men have made the guide of life can have no bearing in any case\r\nof theirs. A more serious way of stating the fundamental objection with\r\nwhich Mr. Gladstone had to deal was this. Popular government is at the\r\nbest difficult to work. It is supremely difficult to work in a statutory\r\nscheme with limits, reservations, and restrictions lurking round every\r\ncorner. Finally, owing to history and circumstance, no people in all the\r\nworld is less fitted to try a supremely difficult experiment in government\r\nthan the people who live in Ireland. Your superstructure, they said, is\r\nenormously heavy, yet you are going to raise it on foundations that are a\r\nquaking bog of incapacity and discontent. This may have been a good answer\r\nto the policy of the bill. But to criticise its provisions from such a\r\npoint of view was as inevitably unfruitful as it would be to set a\r\nhardened agnostic to revise the Thirty-nine articles or the mystic theses\r\nof the Athanasian creed.\r\n\r\nOn the first reading, Mr. Chamberlain astounded allies and opponents alike\r\nby suddenly revealing his view, that the true solution of the question was\r\nto be sought in some form of federation. It was upon the line of\r\nfederation, and not upon the pattern of the self-governing colonies, that\r\nwe should find a way out of the difficulty.(199) Men could hardly trust\r\ntheir ears. On the second reading, he startled us once more by declaring\r\nthat he was perfectly prepared, the very (M117) next day if we pleased, to\r\nestablish between this country and Ireland the relations subsisting\r\nbetween the provincial legislatures and the dominion parliament of\r\nCanada.(200) As to the first proposal, anybody could see that federation\r\nwas a vastly more revolutionary operation than the delegation of certain\r\nlegislative powers to a local parliament. Moreover before federating an\r\nIrish legislature, you must first create it. As to the second proposal,\r\nanybody could see on turning for a quarter of an hour to the Dominion Act\r\nof 1867, that in some of the particulars deemed by Mr. Chamberlain to be\r\nspecially important, a provincial legislature in the Canadian system had\r\nmore unfettered powers than the Irish legislature would have under the\r\nbill. Finally, he urged that inquiry into the possibility of satisfying\r\nthe Irish demand should be carried on by a committee or commission\r\nrepresenting all sections of the House.(201) In face of projects so\r\nstrangely fashioned as this, Mr. Gladstone had a right to declare that\r\njust as the subject held the field in the public mind—for never before had\r\nbeen seen such signs of public absorption in the House and out of the\r\nHouse—so the ministerial plan held the field in parliament. It had many\r\nenemies, but it had not a single serious rival.\r\n\r\nThe debate on the second reading had hardly begun when Lord Salisbury\r\nplaced in the hands of his adversaries a weapon with which they took care\r\nto do much execution. Ireland, he declared, is not one nation, but two\r\nnations. There were races like the Hottentots, and even the Hindoos,\r\nincapable of self-government. He would not place confidence in people who\r\nhad acquired the habit of using knives and slugs. His policy was that\r\nparliament should enable the government of England to govern Ireland.\r\n“Apply that recipe honestly, consistently, and resolutely for twenty\r\nyears, and at the end of that time you will find that Ireland will be fit\r\nto accept any gifts in the way of local government or repeal of coercion\r\nlaws that you may wish to give her.”(202) In the same genial vein, Lord\r\nSalisbury told his Hottentot fellow-citizens—one of the two _invictæ\r\ngentes_ of Mr. Pitt’s famous quotation—that if some great store of\r\nimperial treasure were going to be expended on Ireland, instead of buying\r\nout landlords, it would be far more usefully employed in providing for the\r\nemigration of a million Irishmen. Explanations followed this inconvenient\r\ncandour, but explanations are apt to be clumsy, and the pungency of the\r\nindiscretion kept it long alive. A humdrum speaker, who was able to\r\ncontribute nothing better to the animation of debate, could always by\r\ninsinuating a reference to Hottentots, knives and slugs, the deportation\r\nof a million Irishmen, and twenty years of continuous coercion, make sure\r\nof a roar of angry protest from his opponents, followed by a lusty\r\ncounter-volley from his friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reception of the bill by the organs of Irish opinion was easy to\r\nforetell. The nationalists accepted it in sober and rational language,\r\nsubject to amendments on the head of finance and the constabulary clauses.\r\nThe tories said it was a bill for setting up an Irish republic. It is\r\nanother selfish English plan, said the moderates. Some Irishmen who had\r\nplayed with home rule while it was a phrase, drew back when they saw it in\r\na bill. Others, while holding to home rule, objected to being reduced to\r\nthe status of colonists. The body of home rulers who were protestant was\r\nsmall, and even against them it was retorted that for every protestant\r\nnationalist there were ten catholic unionists. The Fenian organs across\r\nthe Atlantic, while quarrelling with such provisions as the two orders,\r\n“one of which would be Irish and the other English,” did justice to the\r\nbravery of the attempt, and to the new moral forces which it would call\r\nout. The florid violence which the Fenians abandoned was now with proper\r\nvariations adopted by Orangemen in the north. The General Assembly of the\r\npresbyterian church in Ireland passed strong resolutions against a\r\nparliament, in favour of a peasant proprietary, in favour of loyalty, and\r\nof coercion. A few days later the general synod of the protestant\r\nepiscopal church followed suit, and denounced a parliament. The Orange\r\nprint in Belfast drew up a Solemn League and Covenant for Ulster, to\r\nignore and resist an Irish national government. Unionist prints in Dublin\r\ndeclared and indignantly repelled “the selfish English design to get rid\r\nof the Irish nuisance from Westminster, and reduce us to the position of a\r\ntributary dependency.”(203)\r\n\r\nThe pivot of the whole policy was the acceptance of the bill by the\r\nrepresentatives of Ireland. On the evening when the bill was produced, Mr.\r\nParnell made certain complaints as to the reservation of the control of\r\nthe constabulary, as to the power of the first order to effect a deadlock,\r\nand as to finance. He explicitly and publicly warned the government from\r\nthe first that, when the committee stage was reached, he would claim a\r\nlarge decrease in the fraction named for the imperial contribution. There\r\nwas never any dissembling as to this. In private discussion, he had always\r\nheld that the fair proportion of Irish contribution to imperial charges\r\nwas not a fifteenth but a twentieth, and he said no more in the House than\r\nhe had persistently said in the Irish secretary’s room. There too he had\r\nurged what he also declared in the House: that he had always insisted that\r\ndue representation should be given to the minority; that he should welcome\r\nany device for preventing ill-considered legislation, but that the\r\nprovision in the bill, for the veto of the first order, would lead to\r\nprolonged obstruction and delay. Subject to modification on these three\r\nheads, he accepted the bill. “I am convinced,” he said in concluding,\r\n“that if our views are fairly met in committee regarding the defects to\r\nwhich I have briefly alluded,—the bill will be cheerfully accepted by the\r\nIrish people, and by their representatives, as a solution of the\r\nlong-standing dispute between the two countries.”(204)\r\n\r\nIt transpired at a later date that just before the introduction of the\r\nbill, when Mr. Parnell had been made acquainted with its main proposals,\r\nhe called a meeting of eight of his leading colleagues, told them what\r\nthese proposals were, and asked them whether they would take the bill or\r\nleave it.(205) Some began to object to the absence of certain provisions,\r\nsuch as the immediate control of the constabulary, and the right over\r\nduties of customs. Mr. Parnell rose from the table, and clenched the\r\ndiscussion by informing them that if they declined the bill, the\r\ngovernment would go. They at once agreed “to accept it _pro tanto_,\r\nreserving for committee the right of enforcing and, if necessary,\r\nreconsidering their position with regard to these important questions.”\r\nThis is neither more nor less than the form in which Mr. Parnell made his\r\ndeclaration in parliament. There was complete consistency between the\r\nterms of this declaration, and the terms of acceptance agreed to by his\r\ncolleagues, as disclosed in the black days of December four years later.\r\nThe charge of bad faith and hypocrisy so freely made against the Irishmen\r\nis wholly unwarranted by a single word in these proceedings. If the whole\r\ntransaction had been known to the House of Commons, it could not have\r\nimpaired by one jot or tittle the value set by the supporters of the bill\r\non the assurances of the Irishmen that, in principle and subject to\r\nmodification on points named, they accepted the bill as a settlement of\r\nthe question, and would use their best endeavours to make it work.(206)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII. The Political Atmosphere. Defeat Of The Bill. (1886)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Everything on every side was full of traps and mines.... It was in\r\n    the midst of this chaos of plots and counterplots ... that the\r\n    firmness of that noble person [Lord Rockingham] was put to the\r\n    proof. He never stirred from his ground; no, not an inch.—BURKE\r\n    (1766).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere in London became thick and hot with political passion.\r\nVeteran observers declared that our generation had not seen anything like\r\nit. Distinguished men of letters and, as it oddly happened, men who had\r\nwon some distinction either by denouncing the legislative union, or by\r\ninsisting on a decentralisation that should satisfy Irish national\r\naspirations, now choked with anger because they were taken at their word.\r\nJust like irascible scholars of old time who settled controversies about\r\ncorrupt texts by imputing to rival grammarians shameful crimes, so these\r\nwriters could find no other explanation for an opinion that was not their\r\nown about Irish government, except moral turpitude and personal\r\ndegradation. One professor of urbanity compared Mr. Gladstone to a\r\ndesperate pirate burning his ship, or a gambler doubling and trebling his\r\nstake as luck goes against him. Such strange violence in calm natures,\r\nsuch pharisaic pretension in a world where we are all fallen, remains a\r\nriddle. Political differences were turned into social proscription. Whigs\r\nwho could not accept the new policy were specially furious with whigs who\r\ncould. Great ladies purified their lists of the names of old intimates.\r\nAmiable magnates excluded from their dinner-tables and their country\r\nhouses once familiar friends who had fallen into the guilty heresy, and\r\neven harmless portraits of the heresiarch were sternly removed from the\r\nwalls. At some of the political clubs it rained blackballs. It was a\r\npainful demonstration how thin after all is our social veneer, even when\r\nmost highly polished.\r\n\r\nWhen a royal birthday was drawing near, the prime minister wrote to Lord\r\nGranville, his unfailing counsellor in every difficulty political and\r\nsocial: “I am becoming seriously perplexed about my birthday dinner.\r\nHardly any peers of the higher ranks will be available, and not many of\r\nthe lower. Will the seceding colleagues come if they are asked? (Argyll,\r\nto whom I applied privately on the score of old friendship, has already\r\n_refused_ me.) I am for asking them; but I expect refusal. Lastly, it has\r\nbecome customary for the Prince of Wales to dine with me on that day, and\r\nhe brings his eldest son now that the young Prince is of age. But his\r\nposition would be very awkward, if he comes and witnesses a great\r\nnakedness of the land. What do you say to all this? If you cannot help me,\r\nwho can?” Most of the seceding colleagues accepted, and the dinner came\r\noff well enough, though as the host wrote to a friend beforehand, “If\r\nHartington were to get up and move a vote of want of confidence after\r\ndinner, he would almost carry it.” The Prince was unable to be present,\r\nand so the great nakedness was by him unseen, but Prince Albert Victor,\r\nwho was there instead, is described by Mr. Gladstone as “most kind.”\r\n\r\nThe conversion of Peel to free trade forty years before had led to the\r\nsame species of explosion, though Peel had the court strongly with him.\r\nBoth then and now it was the case of a feud within the bosom of a party,\r\nand such feuds like civil wars have ever been the fiercest. In each case\r\nthere was a sense of betrayal—at least as unreasonable in 1886 as it was\r\nin 1846. The provinces somehow took things more rationally than the\r\nmetropolis. Those who were stunned by the fierce moans of London over the\r\nassured decline in national honour and credit, the imminence of civil war,\r\nand the ultimate destruction of British power, found their acquaintances\r\nin the country excited and interested, but still clothed and in their\r\nright minds. The gravity of the question was fully understood, but in\r\ntaking sides ordinary (M118) men did not talk as if they were in for the\r\nbattle of Armageddon. The attempt to kindle the torch of religious fear or\r\nhate was in Great Britain happily a failure. The mass of liberal\r\npresbyterians in Scotland, and of nonconformists in England and Wales,\r\nstood firm, though some of their most eminent and able divines resisted\r\nthe new project, less on religious grounds than on what they took to be\r\nthe balance of political arguments. Mr. Gladstone was able to point to the\r\nconclusive assurances he had received that the kindred peoples in the\r\ncolonies and America regarded with warm and fraternal sympathy the present\r\neffort to settle the long-vexed and troubled relations between Great\r\nBritain and Ireland:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    We must not be discouraged if at home and particularly in the\r\n    upper ranks of society, we hear a variety of discordant notes,\r\n    notes alike discordant from our policy and from one another. You\r\n    have before you a cabinet determined in its purpose and an\r\n    intelligible plan. I own I see very little else in the political\r\n    arena that is determined or that is intelligible.\r\n\r\n\r\nInside the House subterranean activity was at its height all through the\r\nmonth of May. This was the critical period. The regular opposition spoke\r\nlittle and did little; with composed interest they watched others do their\r\nwork. On the ministerial side men wavered and changed and changed again,\r\nfrom day to day and almost from hour to hour. Never were the motions of\r\nthe pendulum so agitated and so irregular. So novel and complex a problem\r\nwas a terrible burden for a new parliament. About half its members had not\r\nsat in any parliament before. The whips were new, some of the leaders on\r\nthe front benches were new, and those of them who were most in earnest\r\nabout the policy were too heavily engrossed in the business of the\r\nmeasure, to have much time for the exercises of explanation, argument, and\r\npersuasion with their adherents. One circumstance told powerfully for\r\nministers. The great central organisation of the liberal party came\r\ndecisively over to Mr. Gladstone (May 5), and was followed by nearly all\r\nthe local associations in the country. Neither whig secession nor radical\r\ndubitation shook the strength inherent in such machinery, in a community\r\nwhere the principle of government by party has solidly established itself.\r\nThis was almost the single consolidating and steadying element in that\r\nhour of dispersion. A serious move in the opposite direction had taken\r\nplace three weeks earlier. A great meeting was held at the Opera House, in\r\nthe Haymarket, presided over by the accomplished whig nobleman who had the\r\nmisfortune to be Irish viceroy in the two dismal years from 1880, and it\r\nwas attended both by Lord Salisbury on one side and Lord Hartington on the\r\nother. This was the first broad public mark of liberal secession, and of\r\nthat practical fusion between whig and tory which the new Irish policy had\r\nactually precipitated, but to which all the signs in the political heavens\r\nhad been for three or four years unmistakably pointing.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the friends of the bill was twofold: first, it lay in the\r\ndislike of coercion as the only visible alternative; and second, it lay in\r\nthe hope of at last touching the firm ground of a final settlement with\r\nIreland. Their weakness was also twofold: first, misgivings about the\r\nexclusion of the Irish members; and second, repugnance to the scheme for\r\nland purchase. There were not a few, indeed, who pronounced the exclusion\r\nof Irish members to be the most sensible part of the plan. Mr. Gladstone\r\nretained his impartiality, but knew that if we proposed to keep the\r\nIrishmen, we should be run in upon quite as fiercely from the other side.\r\nMr. Parnell stood to his original position. Any regular and compulsory\r\nattendance at Westminster, he said, would be highly objectionable to his\r\nfriends. Further, the right of Irish members to take part in purely\r\nEnglish as well as imperial business would be seized upon by English\r\npoliticians, whenever it should answer their purpose, as a pretext for\r\ninterfering in Irish affairs. In short, he foresaw, as all did, the\r\ndifficulties that would inevitably arise from retention. But the tide ran\r\nmore and more strongly the other way. Scotland grew rather restive at a\r\nproposal which, as she apprehended, would make a precedent for herself\r\nwhen her turn for extension of local powers should come, and Scotchmen had\r\nno intention of being shut out (M119) from a voice in imperial affairs. In\r\nEngland, the catholics professed alarm at the prospect of losing the only\r\ncatholic force in the House of Commons. “We cannot spare one of you,”\r\ncried Cardinal Manning. Some partisans of imperial federation took it into\r\ntheir heads that the plan for Ireland would be fatal to a plan for the\r\nwhole empire, though others more rationally conceived that if there was to\r\nbe a scheme for the empire, schemes for its several parts must come first.\r\nSome sages, while pretending infinite friendship to home rule, insisted\r\nthat the parliament at Westminster should retain a direct and active veto\r\nupon legislation at Dublin, and that Irish members should remain as they\r\nwere in London. That is to say, every precaution should be taken to ensure\r\na stiff fight at Westminster over every Irish measure of any importance\r\nthat had already been fought on College Green. Speaking generally, the\r\nfeeling against this provision was due less to the anomaly of taxation\r\nwithout representation, than to fears for the unity of the empire and the\r\nsupremacy of parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Purchase bill proved from the first to be an almost intolerable dose.\r\nVivid pictures were drawn of a train of railway trucks two miles long,\r\nloaded with millions of bright sovereigns, all travelling from the pocket\r\nof the British son of toil to the pocket of the idle Irish landlord. The\r\nnationalists from the first urged that the scheme for home rule should not\r\nbe weighted with a land scheme, though they were willing to accept it so\r\nlong as it was not used to prejudice the larger demand. On the other side\r\nthe Irish landlords themselves peremptorily rejected the plan that had\r\nbeen devised for their protection.\r\n\r\nThe air was thick with suggestions, devices, contrivances, expedients,\r\npossible or madly impossible. Proposals or embryonic notions of proposals\r\nfloated like motes in a sunbeam. Those to whom lobby diplomacy is as the\r\nbreath of their nostrils, were in their element. So were the worthy\r\npersons who are always ready with ingenious schemes for catching a vote or\r\ntwo here, at the cost of twenty votes elsewhere. Intrigue may be too dark\r\na word, but coaxing, bullying, managing, and all the other arts of party\r\nemergency, went on at an unprecedented rate. Of these arts, the\r\nsupervising angels will hardly record that any section had a monopoly. The\r\nlegerdemain that makes words pass for things, and liquefies things into\r\nwords, achieved many flashes of success. But they were only momentary, and\r\nthe solid obstacles remained. The foundations of human character are much\r\nthe same in all historic ages, and every public crisis brings out the same\r\ntypes.\r\n\r\nMuch depended on Mr. Bright, the great citizen and noble orator, who had\r\nin the last five-and-forty years fought and helped to win more than one\r\nbattle for wise and just government; whose constancy had confronted storms\r\nof public obloquy without yielding an inch of his ground; whose eye for\r\nthe highest questions of state had proved itself singularly sure; and\r\nwhose simplicity, love of right, and unsophisticated purity of public and\r\nprivate conduct, commanded the trust and the reverence of nearly all the\r\nbetter part of his countrymen. To Mr. Bright the eyes of many thousands\r\nwere turned in these weeks of anxiety and doubt. He had in public kept\r\nsilence, though in private he made little secret of his disapproval of the\r\nnew policy. Before the bill was produced he had a prolonged conversation\r\n(March 20) with Mr. Gladstone at Downing Street. “Long and weighty” are\r\nthe words in the diary. The minister sketched his general design, Mr.\r\nBright stated his objections much in the form in which, as we shall see,\r\nhe stated them later. Of the exclusion of the Irish members he approved.\r\nThe Land bill he thought quite wrong, for why should so enormous an effort\r\nbe made for one interest only? He expressed his sympathy with Mr.\r\nGladstone in his great difficulties, could not but admire his ardour, and\r\ncame away with the expectation that the obstacles would be found\r\ninvincible, and that the minister would retire and leave others to\r\napproach the task on other lines. Other important persons, it may be\r\nobserved, derived at this time a similar impression from Mr. Gladstone’s\r\nlanguage to them: that he might discern the impossibility of his policy,\r\nthat he would admit it, and would then hand the responsibility over to\r\nLord Hartington, or whoever else might be willing to face it.\r\n\r\n(M120) On the other hand, Mr. Bright left the minister himself not without\r\nhopes that as things went forward he might count on this potent auxiliary.\r\nSo late as the middle of May, though he could not support, it was not\r\ncertain that he would actively oppose. The following letter to Mr.\r\nGladstone best describes his attitude at this time:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Bright to Mr. Gladstone._\r\n    _Rochdale, May 13th, 1886._\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR GLADSTONE,—Your note just received has put me in a great\r\n    difficulty. To-day is the anniversary of the greatest sorrow of my\r\n    life, and I feel pressed to spend it at home. I sent a message to\r\n    Mr. Arnold Morley last evening to say that I did not intend to\r\n    return to town before Monday next—but I shall now arrange to go\r\n    to-morrow—although I do not see how I can be of service in the\r\n    great trouble which has arisen.\r\n\r\n    I feel outside all the contending sections of the liberal\r\n    party—for I am not in favour of home rule, or the creation of a\r\n    Dublin parliament—nor can I believe in any scheme of federation as\r\n    shadowed forth by Mr. Chamberlain.\r\n\r\n    I do not believe that with regard to the Irish question “the\r\n    resources of civilisation are exhausted”; and I think the plan of\r\n    your bill is full of complexity, and gives no hope of successful\r\n    working in Ireland or of harmony between Westminster and Dublin. I\r\n    may say that my regard for you and my sympathy with you have made\r\n    me silent in the discussion on the bills before the House. I\r\n    cannot consent to a measure which is so offensive to the whole\r\n    protestant population of Ireland, and to the whole sentiment of\r\n    the province of Ulster so far as its loyal and protestant people\r\n    are concerned. I cannot agree to exclude them from the protection\r\n    of the imperial parliament. I would do much to clear the rebel\r\n    party from Westminster, and I do not sympathise with those who\r\n    wish to retain them, but admit there is much force in the\r\n    arguments on this point which are opposed to my views upon it.\r\n\r\n    Up to this time I have not been able to bring myself to the point\r\n    of giving a vote in favour of your bills. I am grieved to have to\r\n    say this. As to the Land bill, if it comes to a second reading, I\r\n    fear I must vote against it. It may be that my hostility to the\r\n    rebel party, looking at their conduct since your government was\r\n    formed six years ago, disables me from taking an impartial view of\r\n    this great question. If I could believe them loyal, if they were\r\n    honourable and truthful men, I could yield them much; but I\r\n    suspect that your policy of surrender to them will only place more\r\n    power in their hands, to war with greater effect against the unity\r\n    of the three kingdoms with no increase of good to the Irish\r\n    people.\r\n\r\n    How then can I be of service to you or to the real interests of\r\n    Ireland if I come up to town? I cannot venture to advise you, so\r\n    superior to me in party tactics and in experienced statesmanship,\r\n    and I am not so much in accord with Mr. Chamberlain as to make it\r\n    likely that I can say anything that will affect his course. One\r\n    thing I may remark, that it appears to me that measures of the\r\n    gravity of those now before parliament cannot and ought not to be\r\n    thrust through the House by force of a small majority. The various\r\n    reform bills, the Irish church bill, the two great land bills,\r\n    were passed by very large majorities. In the present case, not\r\n    only the whole tory party oppose, but a very important section of\r\n    the liberal party; and although numerous meetings of clubs and\r\n    associations have passed resolutions of confidence in you, yet\r\n    generally they have accepted your Irish government bill as a\r\n    ’basis’ only, and have admitted the need of important changes in\r\n    the bill—changes which in reality would destroy the bill. Under\r\n    these circumstances it seems to me that more time should be given\r\n    for the consideration of the Irish question. Parliament is not\r\n    ready for it, and the intelligence of the country is not ready for\r\n    it. If it be possible, I should wish that no division should be\r\n    taken upon the bill. If the second reading should be carried only\r\n    by a _small_ majority, it would not forward the bill; but it would\r\n    strengthen the rebel party in their future agitation, and make it\r\n    more difficult for another session or another parliament to deal\r\n    with the question with some sense of independence of that party.\r\n    In any case of a division, it is I suppose certain that a\r\n    considerable majority of British members will oppose the bill.\r\n    Thus, whilst it will have the support of the rebel members, it\r\n    will be opposed by a majority from Great Britain and by a most\r\n    hostile vote from all that is loyal in Ireland. The result will\r\n    be, if a majority supports you it will be one composed in effect\r\n    of the men who for six years past have insulted the Queen, have\r\n    torn down the national flag, have declared your lord lieutenant\r\n    guilty of deliberate murder, and have made the imperial parliament\r\n    an assembly totally unable to manage the legislative business for\r\n    which it annually assembles at Westminster.\r\n\r\n    Pray forgive me for writing this long letter. I need not assure\r\n    you of my sympathy with you, or my sorrow at being unable to\r\n    support your present policy in the House or the country. The more\r\n    I consider the question, the more I am forced in a direction\r\n    contrary to my wishes.\r\n\r\n    For thirty years I have preached justice to Ireland. I am as much\r\n    in her favour now as in past times, but I do not think it justice\r\n    or wisdom for Great Britain to consign her population, including\r\n    Ulster and all her protestant families, to what there is of\r\n    justice and wisdom in the Irish party now sitting in the\r\n    parliament in Westminster.\r\n\r\n    Still, if you think I can be of service, a note to the Reform Club\r\n    will, I hope, find me there to-morrow evening.—Ever most sincerely\r\n    yours,  JOHN BRIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn old parliamentary friend, of great weight and authority, went to Mr.\r\nBright to urge him to support a proposal to read the bill a second time,\r\nand then to hang it up for six months. Bright suffered sore travail of\r\nspirit. At the end of an hour the peacemaker rose to depart. Bright\r\npressed him to continue the wrestle. After three-quarters of an hour more\r\nof it, the same performance took place. It was not until a third hour of\r\ndiscussion that Mr. Bright would let it come to an end, and at the end he\r\nwas still uncertain. The next day the friend met him, looking worn and\r\ngloomy. “You may guess,” Mr. Bright said, “what sort of a night I have\r\nhad.” He had decided to vote against the second reading. The same person\r\nwent to Lord Hartington. He took time to deliberate, and then finally\r\nsaid, “No; Mr. Gladstone and I do not mean the same thing.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe centre of interest lay in the course that might be finally taken by\r\nthose who declared that they accepted the principle of the bill, but\r\ndemurred upon detail. It was upon the group led from Birmingham that the\r\nissue hung. “There are two principles in the bill,” said Mr. Chamberlain\r\nat this time, “which I regard as vital. The first is the principle of\r\nautonomy, to which I am able to give a hearty assent. The second is\r\ninvolved in the method of giving effect to this autonomy. In the bill the\r\ngovernment have proceeded on the lines of separation or of colonial\r\nindependence, whereas, in my humble judgment, they should have adopted the\r\nprinciple of federation as the only one in accordance with democratic\r\naspirations and experience.”(207) He was even so strong for autonomy, that\r\nhe was ready to face all the immense difficulties of federation, whether\r\non the Canadian or some other pattern, rather than lose autonomy. Yet he\r\nwas ready to slay the bill that made autonomy possible. To kill the bill\r\nwas to kill autonomy. To say that they would go to the country on the\r\nplan, and not on the principle, was idle. If the election were to go\r\nagainst the government, that would destroy not only the plan which they\r\ndisliked, but the principle of which they declared that they warmly\r\napproved. The new government that would in that case come into existence,\r\nwould certainly have nothing to say either to plan or principle.\r\n\r\nTwo things, said Mr. Chamberlain on the ninth night of the debate, had\r\nbecome clear during the controversy. One was that the British democracy\r\nhad a passionate devotion to the prime minister. The other was the display\r\nof a sentiment out of doors, “the universality and completeness of which,\r\nI dare say, has taken many of us by surprise, in favour of some form of\r\nhome rule to Ireland, which will give to the Irish people some greater\r\ncontrol over their own affairs.”(208) It did not need so acute a\r\nstrategist as Mr. Chamberlain to perceive that the only hope of rallying\r\nany (M121) considerable portion of the left wing of the party to the\r\ndissentient flag, in face of this strong popular sentiment embodied in a\r\nsupereminent minister, was to avoid as much as possible all irreconcilable\r\nlanguage against either the minister or the sentiment, even while taking\r\nenergetic steps to unhorse the one and to nullify the other.\r\n\r\nThe prime minister meanwhile fought the battle as a battle for a high\r\npublic design once begun should be fought. He took few secondary\r\narguments, but laboured only to hold up to men’s imagination, and to burn\r\ninto their understanding, the lines of central policy, the shame and\r\ndishonour from which it would relieve us, the new life with which it would\r\ninspire Ireland, the ease that it would bring to parliament in England.\r\nHis tenacity, his force and resource, were inexhaustible. He was harassed\r\non every side. The Irish leader pressed him hard upon finance. Old\r\nadherents urged concession about exclusion. The radicals disliked the two\r\norders. Minor points for consideration in committee rained in upon him, as\r\nbeing good reasons for altering the bill before it came in sight of\r\ncommittee. Not a single constructive proposal made any way in the course\r\nof the debate. All was critical and negative. Mr. Gladstone’s grasp was\r\nunshaken, and though he saw remote bearings and interdependent\r\nconsequences where others supposed all to be plain sailing, yet if the\r\nprinciple were only saved he professed infinite pliancy. He protested that\r\nthere ought to be no stereotyping of our minds against modifications, and\r\nthat the widest possible variety of modes of action should be kept open;\r\nand he “hammered hard at his head,” as he put it, to see what could be\r\nworked out in the way of admitting Irish members without danger, and\r\nwithout intolerable inconvenience. If anybody considered, he continued to\r\nrepeat in endless forms, that there was another set of provisions by which\r\nbetter and fuller effect could be given to the principle of the bill, they\r\nwere free to displace all the particulars that hindered this better and\r\nfuller effect being given to the principle.(209)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of May the unionist computation was that 119 on the\r\nministerial side of the House had, with or without qualification, promised\r\nto vote against the second reading. Of these, 70 had publicly committed\r\nthemselves, and 23 more were supposed to be absolutely certain. If the\r\nwhole House voted, this estimate of 93 would give a majority of 17 against\r\nthe bill.(210) The leader of the radical wing, however, reckoned that 55\r\nout of the 119 would vote with him for the second reading, if he\r\npronounced the ministerial amendments of the bill satisfactory. The\r\namendments demanded were the retention of the Irish members, a definite\r\ndeclaration of the supremacy of the imperial parliament, a separate\r\nassembly for Ulster, and the abolition of the restrictive devices for the\r\nrepresentation of minorities. Less than all this might have been taken in\r\ncommittee, provided that the government would expressly say before the\r\nsecond reading, that they would retain the Irish representation on its\r\nexisting footing. The repeated offer by ministers to regard this as an\r\nopen question was derided, because it was contended that if the bill were\r\nonce safe through its second reading, Mr. Bright and the whigs would\r\nprobably vote with ministers against Irish inclusion.\r\n\r\nEven if this ultimatum had been accepted, there would still have remained\r\nthe difficulty of the Land bill, of which Mr. Chamberlain had announced\r\nthat he would move the rejection. In the face of ever-growing\r\nembarrassments and importunities, recourse was had to the usual device of\r\na meeting of the party at the foreign office (May 27). The circular\r\ncalling the meeting was addressed to those liberals who, while retaining\r\nfull freedom on all particulars in the bill, were “in favour of the\r\nestablishment of a legislative body in Dublin for the management of\r\naffairs specifically and exclusively Irish.” This was henceforth to be the\r\ntest of party membership. A man who was for an Irish legislative body was\r\nexpected to come to the party meeting, and a man who was against it was\r\nexpected to stay (M122) away. Many thought this discrimination a mistake.\r\nSome two hundred and twenty members attended. The pith of the prime\r\nminister’s speech, which lasted for an hour, came to this: that the\r\ngovernment would not consent to emasculate the principle of the bill, or\r\nturn it into a mockery, a delusion, and a snare; that members who did not\r\nwholly agree with the bill, might still in accordance with the strict\r\nspirit of parliamentary rules vote for the second reading with a view to\r\nits amendment in committee; that such a vote would not involve support of\r\nthe Land bill; that he was ready to consider any plan for the retention of\r\nthe Irish members, provided that it did not interfere with the liberty of\r\nthe Irish legislative body, and would not introduce confusion into the\r\nimperial parliament. Finally, as to procedure—and here his anxious\r\naudience fell almost breathless—they could either after a second reading\r\nhang up the bill, and defer committee until the autumn; or they could wind\r\nup the session, prorogue, and introduce the bill afresh with the proper\r\namendments in October. The cabinet, he told them, inclined to the later\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nBefore the meeting Mr. Parnell had done his best to impress upon ministers\r\nthe mischievous effect that would be produced on Irish members and in\r\nIreland, by any promise to withdraw the bill after the second reading. On\r\nthe previous evening, I received from him a letter of unusual length. “You\r\nof course,” he said, “are the best judges of what the result may be in\r\nEngland, but if it be permitted me to express an opinion, I should say\r\nthat withdrawal could scarcely fail to give great encouragement to those\r\nwhom it cannot conciliate, to depress and discourage those who are now the\r\nstrongest fighters for the measure, to produce doubt and wonder in the\r\ncountry and to cool enthusiasm; and finally, when the same bill is again\r\nproduced in the autumn, to disappoint and cause reaction among those who\r\nmay have been temporarily disarmed by withdrawal, and to make them at once\r\nmore hostile and less easy to appease.” This letter I carried to Mr.\r\nGladstone the next morning, and read aloud to him a few minutes before he\r\nwas to cross over to the foreign office. For a single instant—the only\r\noccasion that I can recall during all these severe weeks—his patience\r\nbroke. The recovery was as rapid as the flash, for he knew the duty of the\r\nlieutenant of the watch to report the signs of rock or shoal. He was quite\r\nas conscious of all that was urged in Mr. Parnell’s letter as was its\r\nwriter, but perception of risks on one side did not overcome risks on the\r\nother. The same evening they met for a second time:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _May 27._—... Mr. Gladstone and Parnell had a conversation in my\r\n    room. Parnell courteous enough, but depressed and gloomy. Mr.\r\n    Gladstone worn and fagged.... When he was gone, Parnell repeated\r\n    moodily that he might not be able to vote for the second reading,\r\n    if it were understood that after the second reading the bill was\r\n    to be withdrawn. “Very well,” said I, “that will of course destroy\r\n    the government and the policy; but be that as it may, the cabinet,\r\n    I am positive, won’t change their line.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proceedings at the foreign office brought to the supporters of\r\ngovernment a lively sense of relief. In the course of the evening a score\r\nof the waverers were found to have been satisfied, and were struck off the\r\ndissentient lists. But the relief did not last for many hours. The\r\nopposition instantly challenged ministers (May 28) to say plainly which of\r\nthe two courses they intended to adopt. Though short, this was the most\r\nvivacious debate of all. Was the bill to be withdrawn, or was it to be\r\npostponed? If it was to be withdrawn, then, argued the tory leader (Sir\r\nM.H. Beach) in angry tones, the vote on the second reading would be a\r\nfarce. If it was to be postponed, what was that but to paralyse the forces\r\nof law and order in Ireland in the meantime? Such things were trifling\r\nwith parliament, trifling with a vital constitutional question, and\r\ntrifling with the social order which the government professed to be so\r\nanxious to restore. A bill read a second time on such terms as these would\r\nbe neither more nor less than a Continuance-in-Office bill.\r\n\r\nThis biting sally raised the temper of the House on both sides, and Mr.\r\nGladstone met it with that dignity which did not often fail to quell even\r\nthe harshest of his adversaries. “You pronounce that obviously the motive\r\nof the government is to ensure their own continuance in office. They\r\nprefer that to all the considerations connected with the great issue\r\nbefore them, and their minds in fact are of such a mean and degraded\r\norder, that they can only be acted upon, not by motives of honour and\r\nduty, but simply by those of selfishness and personal interest. Sir, I do\r\nnot condescend to discuss that imputation. The dart aimed at our shield,\r\nbeing such a dart as that, is _telum imbelle sine ictu_.”(211)\r\n\r\nThe speaker then got on to the more hazardous part of the ground. He\r\nproceeded to criticise the observation of the leader of the opposition\r\nthat ministers had undertaken to remodel the bill. “That happy word,” he\r\nsaid, “as applied to the structure of the bill, is a pure invention.” Lord\r\nRandolph interjected that the word used was not “remodelled,” but\r\n“reconstructed.” “Does the noble lord dare to say,” asked the minister,\r\n“that it was used in respect of the bill?” “Yes,” said the noble lord.\r\n“Never, never,” cried the minister, with a vehemence that shook the hearts\r\nof doubting followers; “it was used with respect to one particular clause,\r\nand one particular point of the bill, namely so much of it as touches the\r\nfuture relation of the representatives of Ireland to the imperial\r\nparliament.” Before the exciting episode was over, it was stated\r\ndefinitely that if the bill were read a second time, ministers would\r\nadvise a prorogation and re-introduce the bill with amendments. The effect\r\nof this couple of hours was to convince the House that the government had\r\nmade up their minds that it was easier and safer to go to the country with\r\nthe plan as it stood, than to agree to changes that would entangle them in\r\nnew embarrassments, and discredit their confidence in their own handiwork.\r\nIngenious negotiators perceived that their toil had been fruitless. Every\r\nman now knew the precise situation that he had to face, in respect alike\r\nof the Irish bill and liberal unity.\r\n\r\nOn the day following this decisive scene (May 29), under the direction of\r\nthe radical leader an invitation to a conference was issued to those\r\nmembers “who being in favour of some sort of autonomy for Ireland,\r\ndisapproved of the government bills in their present shape.” The form of\r\nthe invitation is remarkable in view of its ultimate effect on Irish\r\nautonomy. The meeting was held on May 31, in the same committee room\r\nupstairs that four years later became associated with the most cruel of\r\nall phases of the Irish controversy. Mr. Chamberlain presided, and some\r\nfifty-five gentlemen attended. Not all of them had hitherto been\r\nunderstood to be in favour either of some sort, or of any sort, of\r\nautonomy for Ireland. The question was whether they should content\r\nthemselves with abstention from the division, or should go into the lobby\r\nagainst the government. If they abstained, the bill would pass, and an\r\nextension of the party schism would be averted. The point was carried, as\r\nall great parliamentary issues are, by considerations apart from the nice\r\nand exact balance of argument on the merits. In anxious and distracting\r\nmoments like this, when so many arguments tell in one way and so many tell\r\nin another, a casting vote often belongs to the moral weight of some\r\nparticular person. The chairman opened in a neutral sense. It seems to\r\nhave been mainly the moral weight of Mr. Bright that sent down the scale.\r\nHe was not present, but he sent a letter. He hoped that every man would\r\nuse his own mind, but for his part he must vote against the bill. This\r\nletter was afterwards described as the death-warrant of the bill and of\r\nthe administration. The course of the men who had been summoned because\r\nthey were favourable to some sort of home rule was decided by the\r\nillustrious statesman who opposed every sort of home rule. Their boat was\r\ndriven straight upon the rocks of coercion by the influence of the great\r\norator who had never in all his career been more eloquent than when he was\r\ndenouncing the mischief and futility of Irish coercion, and protesting\r\nthat force is no remedy.\r\n\r\nOne of the best speakers in the House, though not at that time in the\r\ncabinet, was making an admirably warm and convinced defence alike of the\r\npolicy and the bill while these proceedings were going on. But Mr. Fowler\r\nwas listened to by men of pre-occupied minds. All knew what (M123)\r\nmomentous business was on foot in another part of the parliamentary\r\nprecincts. Many in the ranks were confident that abstention would carry\r\nthe day. Others knew that the meeting had been summoned for no such\r\npurpose, and they made sure that the conveners would have their way. The\r\nquiet inside the House was intense and unnatural. As at last the news of\r\nthe determination upstairs to vote against the bill ran along the benches\r\nbefore the speaker sat down, men knew that the ministerial day was lost.\r\nIt was estimated by the heads of the “Chamberlain group” that if they\r\nabstained, the bill would pass by a majority of five. Such a bill carried\r\nby such a majority could of course not have proceeded much further. The\r\nprinciple of autonomy would have been saved, and time would have been\r\nsecured for deliberation upon a new plan. More than once Mr. Gladstone\r\nobserved that no decision taken from the beginning of the crisis to the\r\nend was either more incomprehensible or more disastrous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe division was taken a little after one o’clock on the morning of the\r\n8th of June. The Irish leader made one of the most masterly speeches that\r\never fell from him. Whether agreeing with or differing from the policy,\r\nevery unprejudiced listener felt that this was not the mere dialectic of a\r\nparty debater, dealing smartly with abstract or verbal or artificial\r\narguments, but the utterance of a statesman with his eye firmly fixed upon\r\nthe actual circumstances of the nation for whose government this bill\r\nwould make him responsible. As he dealt with Ulster, with finance, with\r\nthe supremacy of parliament, with the loyal minority, with the settlement\r\nof education in an Irish legislature,—soberly, steadily, deliberately,\r\nwith that full, familiar, deep insight into the facts of a country, which\r\nis only possible to a man who belongs to it and has passed his life in it,\r\nthe effect of Mr. Parnell’s speech was to make even able disputants on\r\neither side look little better than amateurs.\r\n\r\nThe debate was wound up for the regular opposition by Sir Michael Hicks\r\nBeach, who was justly regarded throughout the session as having led his\r\nparty with remarkable skill and judgment. Like the Irish leader, he seemed\r\nto be inspired by the occasion to a performance beyond his usual range,\r\nand he delivered the final charge with strong effect. The bill, he said,\r\nwas the concoction of the prime minister and the Irish secretary, and the\r\ncabinet had no voice in the matter. The government had delayed the\r\nprogress of the bill for a whole long and weary month, in order to give\r\nparty wirepullers plenty of time in which to frighten waverers. To treat a\r\nvote on the second reading as a mere vote on a principle, without\r\nreference to the possibility of applying it, was a mischievous farce.\r\nCould anybody dream that if he supported the second reading now, he would\r\nnot compromise his action in the autumn and would not be appealed to as\r\nhaving made a virtual promise to Ireland, of which it would be impossible\r\nto disappoint her? As for the bill itself, whatever lawyers might say of\r\nthe theoretic maintenance of supremacy, in practice it would have gone.\r\nAll this side of the case was put by the speaker with the straight and\r\nvigorous thrust that always works with strong effect in this great arena\r\nof contest.\r\n\r\nThen came the unflagging veteran with the last of his five speeches. He\r\nwas almost as white as the flower in his coat, but the splendid compass,\r\nthe flexibility, the moving charm and power of his voice, were never more\r\nwonderful. The construction of the speech was a masterpiece, the temper of\r\nit unbroken, its freedom from taunt and bitterness and small personality\r\nincomparable. Even if Mr. Gladstone had been in the prime of his days,\r\ninstead of a man of seventy-six years all struck; even if he had been at\r\nhis ease for the last four months, instead of labouring with indomitable\r\ntoil at the two bills, bearing all the multifarious burdens of the head of\r\na government, and all the weight of the business of the leader of the\r\nHouse, undergoing all the hourly strain and contention of a political\r\nsituation of unprecedented difficulty,—much of the contention being of\r\nthat peculiarly trying and painful sort which means the parting of\r\ncolleagues and friends,—his closing speech would still have been a\r\nsurprising effort of free, argumentative, and fervid appeal. With the\r\nfervid (M124) appeal was mingled more than one piece of piquant mockery.\r\nMr. Chamberlain had said that a dissolution had no terrors for him. “I do\r\nnot wonder at it. I do not see how a dissolution can have any terrors for\r\nhim. He has trimmed his vessel, and he has touched his rudder in such a\r\nmasterly way, that in whichever direction the winds of heaven may blow\r\nthey must fill his sails. Supposing that at an election public opinion\r\nshould be very strong in favour of the bill, my right hon. friend would\r\nthen be perfectly prepared to meet that public opinion, and tell it, ‘I\r\ndeclared strongly that I adopted the principle of the bill.’ On the other\r\nhand, if public opinion were very adverse to the bill, he again is in\r\ncomplete armour, because he says, ‘Yes, I voted against the bill.’\r\nSupposing, again, public opinion is in favour of a very large plan for\r\nIreland, my right hon. friend is perfectly provided for that case also.\r\nThe government plan was not large enough for him, and he proposed in his\r\nspeech on the introduction of the bill that we should have a measure on\r\nthe basis of federation, which goes beyond this bill. Lastly—and now I\r\nhave very nearly boxed the compass—supposing that public opinion should\r\ntake quite a different turn, and instead of wanting very large measures\r\nfor Ireland, should demand very small measures for Ireland, still the\r\nresources of my right hon. friend are not exhausted, because he is then\r\nable to point out that the last of his plans was for four provincial\r\ncircuits controlled from London.” All these alternatives and provisions\r\nwere visibly “creations of the vivid imagination, born of the hour and\r\nperishing with the hour, totally unavailable for the solution of a great\r\nand difficult problem.”\r\n\r\nNow, said the orator, was one of the golden moments of our history, one of\r\nthose opportunities which may come and may go, but which rarely return, or\r\nif they return, return at long intervals, and under circumstances which no\r\nman can forecast. There was such a golden moment in 1795, on the mission\r\nof Lord Fitzwilliam. At that moment the parliament of Grattan was on the\r\npoint of solving the Irish problem. The cup was at Ireland’s lips, and she\r\nwas ready to drink it, when the hand of England rudely and ruthlessly\r\ndashed it to the ground in obedience to the wild and dangerous intimations\r\nof an Irish faction. There had been no great day of hope for Ireland\r\nsince, no day when you might completely and definitely hope to end the\r\ncontroversy till now—more than ninety years. The long periodic time had at\r\nlast run out, and the star had again mounted into the heavens.\r\n\r\nThis strain of living passion was sustained with all its fire and speed to\r\nthe very close. “Ireland stands at your bar expectant, hopeful, almost\r\nsuppliant. Her words are the words of truth and soberness. She asks a\r\nblessed oblivion of the past, and in that oblivion our interest is deeper\r\neven than hers. You have been asked to-night to abide by the traditions of\r\nwhich we are the heirs. What traditions? By the Irish traditions? Go into\r\nthe length and breadth of the world, ransack the literature of all\r\ncountries, find if you can a single voice, a single book, in which the\r\nconduct of England towards Ireland is anywhere treated except with\r\nprofound and bitter condemnation. Are these the traditions by which we are\r\nexhorted to stand? No, they are a sad exception to the glory of our\r\ncountry. They are a broad and black blot upon the pages of its history,\r\nand what we want to do is to stand by the traditions of which we are the\r\nheirs in all matters except our relations with Ireland, and to make our\r\nrelation with Ireland to conform to the other traditions of our country.\r\nSo we treat our traditions, so we hail the demand of Ireland for what I\r\ncall a blessed oblivion of the past. She asks also a boon for the future;\r\nand that boon for the future, unless we are much mistaken, will be a boon\r\nto us in respect of honour, no less than a boon to her in respect of\r\nhappiness, prosperity and peace. Such, sir, is her prayer. Think, I\r\nbeseech you; think well, think wisely, think, not for the moment, but for\r\nthe years that are to come, before you reject this bill.”\r\n\r\nThe question was put, the sand glass was turned upon the table, the\r\ndivision bells were set ringing. Even at this moment, the ministerial\r\nwhips believed that some were still wavering. A reference made by Mr.\r\nParnell to harmonious communications in the previous summer with a tory\r\nminister, (M125) inclined them to vote for the bill. On the other hand,\r\nthe prospect of going to an election without a tory opponent was no weak\r\ntemptation to a weak man. A common impression was that the bill would be\r\nbeaten by ten or fifteen. Others were sure that it would be twice as much\r\nas either figure. Some on the treasury bench, perhaps including the prime\r\nminister himself, hoped against hope that the hostile majority might not\r\nbe more than five or six. It proved to be thirty. The numbers were 343\r\nagainst 313. Ninety-three liberals voted against the bill. These with the\r\ntwo tellers were between one-third and one-fourth of the full liberal\r\nstrength from Great Britain. So ended the first engagement in this long\r\ncampaign. As I passed into his room at the House with Mr. Gladstone that\r\nnight, he seemed for the first time to bend under the crushing weight of\r\nthe burden that he had taken up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen ministers went into the cabinet on the following day, three of them\r\ninclined pretty strongly towards resignation as a better course than\r\ndissolution; mainly on the ground that the incoming government would then\r\nhave to go to the country with a policy of their own. Mr. Gladstone,\r\nhowever, entirely composed though pallid, at once opened the case with a\r\nlist of twelve reasons for recommending dissolution, and the reasons were\r\nso cogent that his opening of the case was also its closing. They were\r\nentirely characteristic, for they began with precedent and the key was\r\ncourage. He knew of no instance where a ministry defeated under\r\ncircumstances like ours, upon a great policy or on a vote of confidence,\r\nfailed to appeal to the country. Then with a view to the enthusiasm of our\r\nfriends in this country, as well as to feeling in Ireland, it was\r\nessential that we should not let the flag go down. We had been constantly\r\nchallenged to a dissolution, and not to take the challenge up would be a\r\nproof of mistrust, weakness, and a faint heart. “My conclusion is,” he\r\nsaid, “a dissolution is formidable, but resignation would mean for the\r\npresent juncture abandonment of the cause.” His conclusion was accepted\r\nwithout comment. The experts outside the cabinet were convinced that a\r\nbold front was the best way of securing the full fighting power of the\r\nparty. The white feather on such an issue, and with so many minds\r\nwavering, would be a sure provocative of defeat.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone enumerated to the Queen what he took to be the new elements\r\nin the case. There were on the side of the government, 1. The transfer of\r\nthe Irish vote from, the tories, 2. The popular enthusiasm in the liberal\r\nmasses which he had never seen equalled. But what was the electoral value\r\nof enthusiasm against (_a_) anti-Irish prejudices, (_b_) the power of\r\nrank, station, and wealth, (_c_) the kind of influence exercised by the\r\nestablished clergy, ’perversely applied as of course Mr. Gladstone thinks\r\nin politics, but resting upon a very solid basis as founded on the\r\ngenerally excellent and devoted work which they do in their parishes’?\r\nThis remained to be proved. On the other side there was the whig\r\ndefection, with the strange and unnatural addition from Birmingham. “Mr.\r\nGladstone himself has no skill in these matters, and dare not lay an\r\nopinion before your Majesty on the probable general result.” He thought\r\nthere was little chance, if any, of a tory majority in the new parliament.\r\nOpinion taken as a whole seemed to point to a majority not very large,\r\nwhichever way it may be.\r\n\r\nNo election was ever fought more keenly, and never did so many powerful\r\nmen fling themselves with livelier activity into a great struggle. The\r\nheaviest and most telling attack came from Mr. Bright, who had up to now\r\nin public been studiously silent. Every word, as they said of Daniel\r\nWebster, seemed to weigh a pound. His arguments were mainly those of his\r\nletter already given, but they were delivered with a gravity and force\r\nthat told powerfully upon the large phalanx of doubters all over the\r\nkingdom. On the other side, Mr. Gladstone’s plume waved in every part of\r\nthe field. He unhorsed an opponent as he flew past on the road; his voice\r\nrang with calls as thrilling as were ever heard in England; he appealed to\r\nthe individual, to his personal responsibility, to the best elements in\r\nhim, to the sense of justice, to the powers of hope and of sympathy; he\r\n(M126) displayed to the full that rare combination of qualities that had\r\nalways enabled him to view affairs in all their range, at the same time\r\nfrom the high commanding eminence and on the near and sober level.\r\n\r\nHe left London on June 17 on his way to Edinburgh, and found “wonderful\r\ndemonstrations all along the road; many little speeches; could not be\r\nhelped.” “The feeling here,” he wrote from Edinburgh (June 21), “is truly\r\nwonderful, especially when, the detestable state of the press is\r\nconsidered.” Even Mr. Goschen, whom he described as “supplying in the\r\nmain, soul, brains, and movement to the dissentient body,” was handsomely\r\nbeaten in one of the Edinburgh divisions, so fatal was the proximity of\r\nAchilles. “_June 22._ Off to Glasgow, 12-¾. Meeting at 3. Spoke an hour\r\nand twenty minutes. Off at 5.50. Reached Hawarden at 12.30 or 40. Some\r\nspeeches by the way; others I declined. The whole a scene of triumph. God\r\nhelp us, His poor creatures.” At Hawarden, he found chaos in his room, and\r\nhe set to work upon it, but he did not linger. On June 25, “off to\r\nManchester; great meeting in the Free Trade Hall. Strain excessive. Five\r\nmiles through the streets to Mr. Agnew’s; a wonderful spectacle half the\r\nway.” From Manchester he wrote, “I have found the display of enthusiasm\r\nfar beyond all former measure,” and the torrid heat of the meeting almost\r\nbroke him down, but friends around him heard him murmur, “I must do it,”\r\nand bracing himself with tremendous effort he went on. Two days later\r\n(June 28) he wound up the campaign in a speech at Liverpool, which even\r\nold and practised political hands who were there, found the most\r\nmagnificent of them all. Staying at Courthey, the residence of his\r\nnephews, in the morning he enters, “Worked up the Irish question once more\r\nfor my last function. Seven or eight hours of processional uproar, and a\r\nspeech of an hour and forty minutes to five or six thousand people in\r\nHengler’s Circus. Few buildings give so noble a presentation of an\r\naudience. Once more my voice held out in a marvellous manner. I went in\r\nbitterness, in the heat of my spirit, but the hand of the Lord was strong\r\nupon me.”\r\n\r\nHe had no sooner returned to Hawarden, than he wrote to tell Mrs.\r\nGladstone (July 2) of a stroke which was thought to have a curiously\r\ndæmonic air about it:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Leith business will show you I have not been inactive\r\n    here.—former M.P. _attended my meeting in the Music Hall_, and was\r\n    greeted by me accordingly (he had voted against us after wobbling\r\n    about much). Hearing by late post yesterday that waiting to the\r\n    last he had then declared against us, I telegraphed down to\r\n    Edinburgh in much indignation, that they might if they liked put\r\n    me up against him, and I would go down again and speak if they\r\n    wished it. They seem to have acted with admirable pluck and\r\n    promptitude. Soon after mid-day to-day I received telegrams to say\r\n    I am elected for Midlothian,(212) and _also for Leith_,—having\r\n    retired rather than wait to be beaten. I told them instantly to\r\n    publish this, as it may do good.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Queen, who had never relished these oratorical crusades whether he was\r\nin opposition or in office, did not approve of the first minister of the\r\ncrown addressing meetings outside of his own constituency. In reply to a\r\ngracious and frank letter from Balmoral, Mr. Gladstone wrote:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    He must state frankly what it is that has induced him thus to\r\n    yield [to importunity for speeches]. It is that since the death of\r\n    Lord Beaconsfield, in fact since 1880, the leaders of the\r\n    opposition, Lord Salisbury and Lord Iddesleigh (he has not\r\n    observed the same practice in the case of Sir M. H. Beach) have\r\n    established a rule of what may be called popular agitation, by\r\n    addressing public meetings from time to time at places with which\r\n    they were not connected. This method was peculiarly marked in the\r\n    case of Lord Salisbury as a peer, and this change on the part of\r\n    the leaders of opposition has induced Mr. Gladstone to deviate on\r\n    this critical occasion from the rule which he had (he believes)\r\n    generally or uniformly observed in former years. He is, as he has\r\n    previously apprised your Majesty, aware of the immense\r\n    responsibility he has assumed, and of the severity of just\r\n    condemnation which will be pronounced upon him, if he should\r\n    eventually prove to have been wrong. But your Majesty will be the\r\n    first to perceive that, even if it had been possible for him to\r\n    decline this great contest, it was not possible for him having\r\n    entered upon it, to conduct it in a half-hearted manner, or to\r\n    omit the use of any means requisite in order to place (what he\r\n    thinks) the true issue before the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nNature, however, served the royal purpose. Before his speech at Liverpool,\r\nhe was pressed to speak in the metropolis:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    As to my going to London,—he wrote in reply,—I have twice had my\r\n    chest rather seriously strained, and I have at this moment a sense\r\n    of internal fatigue within it which is quite new to me, from the\r\n    effects of a bad arrangement in the hall at Manchester. Should\r\n    anything like it be repeated at Liverpool to-morrow I shall not be\r\n    fit physically to speak for a week, if then. Mentally I have never\r\n    undergone such an uninterrupted strain as since January 30 of this\r\n    year. The forming and reforming of the government, the work of\r\n    framing the bills, and _studying the subject_ (which none of the\r\n    opponents would do), have left me almost stunned, and I have the\r\n    autumn in prospect with, perhaps, most of the work to do over\r\n    again if we succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut this was not to be. The incomparable effort was in vain. The sons of\r\nZeruiah were too hard for him, and England was unconvinced.\r\n\r\nThe final result was that the ministerialists or liberals of the main body\r\nwere reduced from 235 to 196, the tories rose from 251 to 316, the\r\ndissentient liberals fell to 74, and Mr. Parnell remained at his former\r\nstrength. In other words, the opponents of the Irish policy of the\r\ngovernment were 390, as against 280 in its favour; or a unionist majority\r\nof 110. Once more no single party possessed an independent or absolute\r\nmajority. An important member of the tory party said to a liberal of his\r\nacquaintance (July 7), that he was almost sorry the tories had not played\r\nthe bold game and fought independently of the dissentient liberals. “But\r\nthen,” he added, “we could not have beaten you on the bill, without the\r\ncompact to spare unionist seats.”\r\n\r\nEngland had returned opponents of the liberal policy in the proportion of\r\ntwo and a half to one against its friends; but Scotland approved in the\r\nproportion of three to two, Wales approved by five to one, and Ireland by\r\nfour and a half to one. Another fact with a warning in it was that, taking\r\nthe total poll for Great Britain, the liberals had 1,344,000, the seceders\r\n397,000, and the tories 1,041,000. Therefore in contested constituencies\r\nthe liberals of the main body were only 76,000 behind the forces of tories\r\nand seceders combined. Considering the magnitude and the surprise of the\r\nissue laid before the electors, and in view of the confident prophecies of\r\neven some peculiar friends of the policy, that both policy and its authors\r\nwould be swept out of existence by a universal explosion of national anger\r\nand disgust, there was certainly no final and irrevocable verdict in a\r\nhostile British majority of no more than four per cent, of the votes\r\npolled. Apart from electoral figures, coercion loomed large and near at\r\nhand, and coercion tried under the new political circumstances that would\r\nfor the first time attend it, might well be trusted to do much more than\r\nwipe out the margin at the polls. “There is nothing in the recent defeat,”\r\nsaid Mr. Gladstone, “to abate the hopes or to modify the anticipations of\r\nthose who desire to meet the wants and wishes of Ireland.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question now before Mr. Gladstone was whether to meet the new\r\nparliament or at once to resign. For a short time he wavered, along with\r\nan important colleague, and then he and all the rest came round to\r\nresignation. The considerations that guided him were these. It is best for\r\nIreland that the party strongest in the new parliament should be at once\r\nconfronted with its responsibilities. Again, we were bound to consider\r\nwhat would most tend to reunite the liberal party, and it was in\r\nopposition that the chances of such reunion would be likely to stand\r\nhighest, especially in view of coercion which many of the dissidents had\r\nrefused to contemplate. If he could remodel the bill or frame a new one,\r\nthat might be a possible ground for endeavouring to make up a majority,\r\nbut he could not see his way to any (M127) such process, though he was\r\nready for certain amendments. Finally, if we remained, an amendment would\r\nbe moved definitely committing the new House against home rule.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion was for immediate resignation, and his colleagues were\r\nunanimous in assent. The Irish view was different and impossible.\r\nReturning from a visit to Ireland I wrote to Mr. Gladstone (July 19):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    You may perhaps care to see what —— [not a secular politician]\r\n    thinks, so I enclose you a conversation between him and ——. He\r\n    does not show much strength of political judgment, and one can\r\n    understand why Parnell never takes him into counsel. Parnell, of\r\n    course, is anxious for us to hold on to the last moment. Our fall\r\n    will force him without delay to take up a new and difficult line.\r\n    But his letters to me, especially the last, show a desperate\r\n    willingness to blink the new parliamentary situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Parnell, in fact, pressed with some importunity that we should meet\r\nthe new parliament, on the strange view that the result of the election\r\nwas favourable on general questions, and indecisive only on Irish policy.\r\nWe were to obtain the balance of supply in an autumn sitting, in January\r\nto attack registration reform, and then to dissolve upon that, without\r\nmaking any Irish proposition whatever. This curious suggestion left\r\naltogether out of sight the certainty that an amendment referring to\r\nIreland would be at once moved on the Address, such as must beyond all\r\ndoubt command the whole of the tories and a large part, if not all, of the\r\nliberal dissentients. Only one course was possible for the defeated\r\nministers, and they resigned.\r\n\r\nOn July 30, Mr. Gladstone had his final audience of the Queen, of which he\r\nwrote the memorandum following:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Conversation with the Queen, August 2, 1886._\r\n\r\n    The conversation at my closing audience on Friday was a singular\r\n    one, when regarded as the probable last word with the sovereign\r\n    after fifty-five years of political life, and a good quarter of a\r\n    century’s service rendered to her in office.\r\n\r\n    The Queen was in good spirits; her manners altogether pleasant.\r\n    She made me sit at once. Asked after my wife as we began, and sent\r\n    a kind message to her as we ended. About me personally, I think,\r\n    her single remark was that I should require some rest. I remember\r\n    that on a closing audience in 1874 she said she felt sure I might\r\n    be reckoned upon to support the throne. She did not say anything\r\n    of the sort to-day. Her mind and opinions have since that day been\r\n    seriously warped, and I respect her for the scrupulous avoidance\r\n    of anything which could have seemed to indicate a desire on her\r\n    part to claim anything in common with me.\r\n\r\n    Only at three points did the conversation touch upon anything even\r\n    faintly related to public affairs.... The second point was the\r\n    conclusion of some arrangement for appanages or incomes on behalf\r\n    of the third generation of the royal house. I agreed that there\r\n    ought at a suitable time to be a committee on this subject, as had\r\n    been settled some time back, she observing that the recent\r\n    circumstances had made the time unsuitable. I did not offer any\r\n    suggestion as to the grounds of the affair, but said it seemed to\r\n    me possible to try some plan under which intended marriages should\r\n    be communicated without forcing a reply from the Houses. Also I\r\n    agreed that the amounts were not excessive. I did not pretend to\r\n    have a solution ready: but said it would, of course, be the duty\r\n    of the government to submit a plan to the committee. The third\r\n    matter was trivial: a question or two from her on the dates and\r\n    proceedings connected with the meeting. The rest of the\r\n    conversation, not a very long one, was filled up with nothings. It\r\n    is rather melancholy. But on neither side, given the conditions,\r\n    could it well be helped.\r\n\r\n    On the following day she wrote a letter, making it evident that,\r\n    so far as Ireland was concerned, she could not trust herself to\r\n    say what she wanted to say....\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the hundreds of letters that reached him every week was one from an\r\nevangelical lady of known piety, enclosing him a form of prayer that had\r\nbeen issued against home rule. His acknowledgment (July 27) shows none of\r\nthe impatience of the baffled statesman:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I thank you much for your note; and though I greatly deplored the\r\n    issue, and the ideas of the prayer in question, yet, from the\r\n    moment when I heard it was your composition, I knew perfectly well\r\n    that it was written in entire good faith, and had no relation to\r\n    political controversy in the ordinary sense. I cannot but think\r\n    that, in bringing the subject of Irish intolerance before the\r\n    Almighty Father, we ought to have some regard to the fact that\r\n    down to the present day, as between the two religions, the offence\r\n    has been in the proportion of perhaps a hundred to one on the\r\n    protestant side, and the suffering by it on the Roman side. At the\r\n    present hour, I am pained to express my belief that there is far\r\n    more of intolerance in action from so-called protestants against\r\n    Roman catholics, than from Roman catholics against protestants. It\r\n    is a great satisfaction to agree with you, as I feel confident\r\n    that I must do, in the conviction that of prayers we cannot\r\n    possibly have too much in this great matter, and for my own part I\r\n    heartily desire that, unless the policy I am proposing be for the\r\n    honour of God and the good of His creatures, it may be trampled\r\n    under foot and broken into dust. Of your most charitable thoughts\r\n    and feelings towards me I am deeply sensible, and I remain with\r\n    hearty regard.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he wrote at this time to R. H. Hutton (July 2), one of the choice\r\nspirits of our age, “Rely upon it, I can never quarrel with you or with\r\nBright. What vexes me is when differences disclose baseness, which\r\nsometimes happens.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK X. 1886-1892\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I. The Morrow Of Defeat. (1886-1887)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Charity rendereth a man truly great, enlarging his mind into a\r\n    vast circumference, and to a capacity nearly infinite; so that it\r\n    by a general care doth reach all things, by an universal affection\r\n    doth embrace and grace the world.... Even a spark of it in\r\n    generosity of dealing breedeth admiration; a glimpse of it in\r\n    formal courtesy of behaviour procureth much esteem, being deemed\r\n    to accomplish and adorn a man.—BARROW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the rejection of his Irish policy in the summer of 1886, Mr.\r\nGladstone had a period of six years before him, the life of the new\r\nparliament. Strangely dramatic years they were, in some respects unique in\r\nour later history. The party schism among liberals grew deeper and wider.\r\nThe union between tories and seceders became consolidated and final. The\r\nalternative policy of coercion was passed through parliament in an extreme\r\nform and with violent strain on the legislative machinery, and it was\r\ncarried out in Ireland in a fashion that pricked the consciences of many\r\nthousands of voters who had resisted the proposals of 1886. A fierce storm\r\nrent the Irish phalanx in two, and its leader vanished from the field\r\nwhere for sixteen years he had fought so bold and uncompromising a fight.\r\nDuring this period Mr. Gladstone stood in the most trying of all the\r\nvaried positions of his life, and without flinching he confronted it in\r\nthe strong faith that the national honour as well as the assuagement\r\n(M128) of the inveterate Irish wound in the flank of his country, were the\r\nissues at stake.\r\n\r\nThis intense pre-occupation in the political struggle did not for a single\r\nweek impair his other interests, nor stay his ceaseless activity in\r\ncontroversies that were not touched by politics. Not even now, when the\r\ngreat cause to which he had so daringly committed himself was in decisive\r\nissue, could he allow it to dull or sever what had been the standing\r\nconcerns of life and thought to him for so long a span of years. As from\r\nhis youth up, so now behind the man of public action was the diligent,\r\neager, watchful student, churchman, apologist, divine. And what is curious\r\nand delightful is that he never set a more admirable example of the tone\r\nand temper in which literary and religious controversy should be\r\nconducted, than in these years when in politics exasperation was at its\r\nworst. It was about this time that he wrote: “Certainly one of the lessons\r\nlife has taught me is that where there is known to be a common object, the\r\npursuit of truth, there should also be a studious desire to interpret the\r\nadversary in the best sense his words will fairly bear; to avoid whatever\r\nwidens the breach; and to make the most of whatever tends to narrow it.\r\nThese I hold to be part of the laws of knightly tournament.” And to these\r\nlaws he sedulously conformed. Perhaps at some happy time before the day of\r\njudgment they may be transferred from the tournament to the battle-fields\r\nof philosophy, criticism, and even politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the defeat in which his tremendous labours had for the moment ended,\r\nhe made his way to what was to him the most congenial atmosphere in the\r\nworld, to the company of Döllinger and Acton, at Tegernsee in Bavaria.\r\n“Tegernsee,” Lord Acton wrote to me (Sept. 7), “is an out-of-the-way\r\nplace, peaceful and silent, and as there is a good library in the house, I\r\nhave taken some care of his mind, leading in the direction of little\r\nFrench comedies, and away from the tragedy of existence. It has done him\r\ngood, and he has just started with Döllinger to climb a high mountain in\r\nthe neighbourhood.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Mrs. Gladstone._\r\n\r\n    _Tegernsee, Aug. 28, 1886._—We found Döllinger reading in the\r\n    garden. The course of his life is quite unchanged. His\r\n    constitution does not appear at all to have given way. He beats me\r\n    utterly in standing, but that is not saying much, as it never was\r\n    one of my gifts; and he is not conscious (eighty-seven last\r\n    February) of any difficulty with the heart in going up hill. His\r\n    deafness has increased materially, but not so that he cannot carry\r\n    on very well conversation with a single person. We have talked\r\n    much together even on disestablishment which he detests, and\r\n    Ireland as to which he is very apprehensive, but he never seems to\r\n    shut up his mind by prejudice. I had a good excuse for giving him\r\n    my pamphlet,(213) but I do not know whether he will tell us what\r\n    he thinks of it. He was reading it this morning. He rises at six\r\n    and breakfasts alone. Makes a _good_ dinner at two and has nothing\r\n    more till the next morning. He does not appear after dark. On the\r\n    whole one sees no reason why he should not last for several years\r\n    yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n“When Dr. Döllinger was eighty-seven,” Mr. Gladstone wrote later, “he\r\nwalked with me seven miles across the hill that separates the Tegernsee\r\nfrom the next valley to the eastward. At that time he began to find his\r\nsleep subject to occasional interruptions, and he had armed himself\r\nagainst them by committing to memory the first three books of the\r\n_Odyssey_ for recital.”(214) Of Mr. Gladstone Döllinger had said in 1885,\r\n“I have known Gladstone for thirty years, and would stand security for him\r\nany day; his character is a very fine one, and he possesses a rare\r\ncapability for work. I differ from him in his political views on many\r\npoints, and it is difficult to convince him, for he is clad in triple\r\nsteel.”(215)\r\n\r\nAnother high personage in the Roman catholic world sent him letters\r\nthrough Acton, affectionately written and with signs of serious as well as\r\nsympathising study of his Irish policy. A little later (Sept. 21) Mr.\r\nGladstone writes to his wife at Hawarden:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Bishop Strossmayer may make a journey all the way to Hawarden, and\r\n    it seems that Acton may even accompany him, which would make it\r\n    much more manageable. His coming would be a great compliment, and\r\n    cannot be discouraged or refused. It would, however, be a serious\r\n    affair, for he speaks no language with which as a spoken tongue we\r\n    are familiar, his great cards being Slavonic and Latin.\r\n    Unfortunately I have a very great increase of difficulty in\r\n    _hearing_ the words in foreign tongues, a difficulty which I hope\r\n    has hardly begun with you as yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike a good host, Lord Acton kept politics out of his way as well as he\r\ncould, but some letter of mine “set him on fire, and he is full of ——’s\r\nblunder and of Parnell’s bill.” Parliamentary duty was always a sting to\r\nhim, and by September 20 he was back in the House of Commons, speaking on\r\nthe Tenants Relief (Ireland) bill. Then to the temple of peace at Hawarden\r\nfor the rest of the year, to read the _Iliad_ “for the twenty-fifth or\r\nthirtieth time, and every time richer and more glorious than before”; to\r\nwrite elaborately on Homeric topics; to receive a good many visitors; and\r\nto compose the admirable article on Tennyson’s second _Locksley Hall_. On\r\nthis last let us pause for an instant. The moment was hardly one in which,\r\nfrom a man of nature less great and powerful than Mr. Gladstone, we should\r\nhave counted on a buoyant vindication of the spirit of his time. He had\r\njust been roughly repulsed in the boldest enterprise of his career; his\r\nname was a target for infinite obloquy; his motives were largely denounced\r\nas of the basest; the conflict into which he had plunged and from which he\r\ncould not withdraw was hard; friends had turned away from him; he was old;\r\nthe issue was dubious and dark. Yet the personal, or even what to him were\r\nthe national discomfitures of the hour, were not allowed to blot the sun\r\nout of the heavens. His whole soul rose in challenge against the tragic\r\ntones of Tennyson’s poem, as he recalled the solid tale of the vast\r\nimprovements, the enormous mitigation of the sorrows and burdens of\r\nmankind, that had been effected in the land by public opinion and public\r\nauthority, operative in the exhilarating sphere of self-government during\r\nthe sixty years between the first and second _Locksley Hall_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The sum of the matter seems to be that upon the whole, and in a\r\n    degree, we who lived fifty, sixty, seventy years back, and are\r\n    living now, have lived into a gentler time; that the public\r\n    conscience has grown more tender, as indeed was very needful; and\r\n    that in matters of practice, at sight of evils formerly regarded\r\n    with indifference or even connivance, it now not only winces but\r\n    rebels; that upon the whole the race has been reaping, and not\r\n    scattering; earning and not wasting; and that without its being\r\n    said that the old Prophet is wrong, it may be said that the young\r\n    Prophet was unquestionably right.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the way in which a man of noble heart and high vision as of a\r\ncircling eagle, transcends his individual chagrins. All this optimism was\r\nthe natural vein of a statesman who had lived a long life of effort in\r\npersuading opinion in so many regions, in overcoming difficulty upon\r\ndifficulty, in content with a small reform where men would not let him\r\nachieve a great one, in patching where he could not build anew, in\r\nunquenchable faith, hope, patience, endeavour. Mr. Gladstone knew as well\r\nas Tennyson that “every blessing has its drawbacks, and every age its\r\ndangers”; he was as sensitive as Tennyson or Ruskin or any of them, to the\r\nimplacable tragedy of industrial civilisation—the city children\r\n“blackening soul and sense in city slime,” progress halting on palsied\r\nfeet “among the glooming alleys,” crime and hunger casting maidens on the\r\nstreet, and all the other recesses of human life depicted by the poetic\r\nprophet in his sombre hours. But the triumphs of the past inspired\r\nconfidence in victories for the future, and meanwhile he thought it well\r\nto remind Englishmen that “their country is still young as well as old,\r\nand that in these latest days it has not been unworthy of itself.”(216)\r\n\r\nOn his birthday he enters in his diary:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Dec. 29, 1886._—This day in its outer experience recalls the\r\n    Scotch usage which would say, “terrible pleasant.” In spite of the\r\n    ruin of telegraph wires by snow, my letters and postal arrivals of\r\n    to-day have much exceeded those of last year. Even my share of the\r\n    reading was very heavy. The day was gone before it seemed to have\r\n    begun, all amidst stir and festivity. The estimate was nine\r\n    hundred arrivals. O for a birthday of recollection. It is long\r\n    since I have had one. There is so much to say on the soul’s\r\n    history, but bracing is necessary to say it, as it is for reading\r\n    Dante. It has been a year of shock and strain. I think a year of\r\n    some progress; but of greater absorption in interests which,\r\n    though profoundly human, are quite off the line of an old man’s\r\n    direct preparation for passing the River of Death. I have not had\r\n    a chance given me of creeping from this whirlpool, for I cannot\r\n    abandon a cause which is so evidently that of my fellow-men, and\r\n    in which a particular part seems to be assigned to me. Therefore\r\n    am I not disturbed “though the hills be carried into the middle of\r\n    the sea.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Lord Acton._\r\n\r\n    _Hawarden, Jan. 13, 1887._—It is with much pleasure that I read\r\n    your estimate of Chamberlain. His character is remarkable, as are\r\n    in a very high degree his talents. It is one of my common sayings\r\n    that to me characters of the political class are the most\r\n    mysterious of all I meet, so that I am obliged to travel the road\r\n    of life surrounded by an immense number of judgments more or less\r\n    in suspense, and getting on for practical purposes as well as I\r\n    can.\r\n\r\n    I have with a clear mind and conscience not only assented to but\r\n    promoted the present conferences, and I had laboured in that sense\r\n    long before Mr. Chamberlain made his speech at Birmingham. It will\r\n    surprise as well as grieve me if they do harm; if indeed they do\r\n    not do some little good. Large and final arrangements, it would be\r\n    rash I think to expect.\r\n\r\n    The tide is flowing, though perhaps not rapidly, in our favour.\r\n    Without our lifting a finger, a crumbling process has begun in\r\n    both the opposite parties. “In quietness and in confidence shall\r\n    be your strength” is a blessed maxim, often applicable to\r\n    temporals as well as spirituals. I have indeed one temptation to\r\n    haste, namely, that the hour may come for me to say farewell and\r\n    claim my retirement; but inasmuch as I remain _in situ_ for the\r\n    Irish question only, I cannot be so foolish as to allow myself to\r\n    ruin by precipitancy my own purpose. Though I am writing a paper\r\n    on the Irish question for Mr. Knowles, it is no trumpet-blast, but\r\n    is meant to fill and turn to account a season of comparative\r\n    quietude.\r\n\r\n    The death of Iddesleigh has shocked and saddened us all. He was\r\n    full of excellent qualities, but had not the backbone and strength\r\n    of fibre necessary to restore the tone of a party demoralised by\r\n    his former leader. In gentleness, temper, sacrifice of himself to\r\n    the common purpose of his friends, knowledge, quickness of\r\n    perception, general integrity of intention, freedom from personal\r\n    aims, he was admirable.... I have been constantly struggling to\r\n    vindicate a portion of my time for the pursuits I want to follow,\r\n    but with very little success indeed. Some rudiments of Olympian\r\n    religion have partially taken shape. I have a paper ready for\r\n    Knowles probably in his March number on the Poseidon of Homer, a\r\n    most curious and exotic personage.... Williams and Norgate got me\r\n    the books I wanted, but alack for the time to read them! In\r\n    addition to want of time, I have to deplore my slowness in\r\n    reading, declining sight, and declining memory; all very serious\r\n    affairs for one who has such singular reason to be thankful as to\r\n    general health and strength.\r\n\r\n    I wish I could acknowledge duly or pay even in part your\r\n    unsparing, untiring kindness in the discharge of your engagements\r\n    as “Cook.” Come early to England—and stay long. We will try what\r\n    we can to bind you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few months later, he added to his multifarious exercises in criticism\r\nand controversy, a performance that attracted especial attention.(217)\r\n“Mamma and I,” he wrote to Mrs. Drew, “are each of us still separately\r\nengaged in a death-grapple with _Robert Elsmere_. I complained of some of\r\nthe novels you gave me to read as too stiff, but they are nothing to this.\r\nIt is wholly out of the common order. At present I regard with doubt and\r\ndread the idea of doing anything on it, but cannot yet be sure whether\r\nyour observations will be verified or not. In any case it is a tremendous\r\nbook.” And on April 1 (1888), he wrote, “By hard work I have finished and\r\nam correcting my article on _Robert Elsmere_. It is rather stiff work. I\r\nhave had two letters from her. She is much to be liked personally, but is\r\na fruit, I think, of what must be called Arnoldism.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Lord Acton._\r\n\r\n    _Aston Clinton, Tring, Easter Day, April 1, ’88._—I do not like to\r\n    let too long a time elapse without some note of intercourse, even\r\n    though that season approaches which brings you back to the shores\r\n    of your country. Were you here I should have much to say on many\r\n    things; but I will now speak, or first speak, of what is\r\n    uppermost, and would, if a mind is like a portmanteau, be taken or\r\n    tumble out first.\r\n\r\n    You perhaps have not heard of _Robert Elsmere_, for I find without\r\n    surprise, that it makes its way slowly into public notice. It is\r\n    not far from twice the length of an ordinary novel; and the labour\r\n    and effort of reading it all, I should say, sixfold; while one\r\n    could no more stop in it than in reading Thucydides. The idea of\r\n    the book, perhaps of the writer, appears to be a movement of\r\n    retreat from Christianity upon Theism: a Theism with a Christ\r\n    glorified, always in the human sense, but beyond the ordinary\r\n    measure. It is worked out through the medium of a being—one ought\r\n    to say a character, but I withhold the word, for there is no\r\n    sufficient substratum of character to uphold the qualities—gifted\r\n    with much intellectual subtlety and readiness, and almost every\r\n    conceivable moral excellence. He finds vent in an energetic\r\n    attempt to carry his new gospel among the skilled artisans of\r\n    London, whom the writer apparently considers as supplying the\r\n    _norm_ for all right human judgment. He has extraordinary success,\r\n    establishes a new church under the name of the new Christian\r\n    brotherhood, kills himself with overwork, but leaves his project\r\n    flourishing in a certain “Elgood Street.” It is in fact (like the\r\n    Salvation Army), a new Kirche der Zukunft.\r\n\r\n    I am always inclined to consider this Theism as among the least\r\n    defensible of the positions alternative to Christianity. Robert\r\n    Elsmere who has been a parish clergyman, is upset entirely, as it\r\n    appears, by the difficulty of accepting miracles, and by the\r\n    suggestion that the existing Christianity grew up in an age\r\n    specially predisposed to them.\r\n\r\n    I want as usual to betray you into helping the lame dog over the\r\n    stile; and I should like to know whether you would think me\r\n    violently wrong in holding that the period of the Advent was a\r\n    period when the appetite for, or disposition to, the supernatural\r\n    was declining and decaying; that in the region of human thought,\r\n    speculation was strong and scepticism advancing; that if our Lord\r\n    were a mere man, armed only with human means, His whereabouts was\r\n    in this and many other ways misplaced by Providence; that the\r\n    gospels and the New Testament must have much else besides miracle\r\n    torn out of them, in order to get us down to the _caput mortuum_\r\n    of Elgood Street. This very remarkable work is in effect identical\r\n    with the poor, thin, ineffectual production published with some\r\n    arrogance by the Duke of Somerset, which found a quack remedy for\r\n    difficulties in what he considered the impregnable citadel of\r\n    belief in God.\r\n\r\n    Knowles has brought this book before me, and being as strong as it\r\n    is strange, it cannot perish still-born. I am tossed about with\r\n    doubt as to writing upon it.\r\n\r\n    _To Lord Acton._\r\n\r\n    _Oxford, April 8, ’88._—I am grateful for your most interesting\r\n    letter, which contains very valuable warnings. On the other side\r\n    is copied what I have written on two of the points raised by the\r\n    book. Have I said too much of the Academy? I have spoken only of\r\n    the first century. You refer to (apparently) about 250 A.D. as a\r\n    time of great progress? But I was astonished on first reading the\r\n    census of Christian clergy in Rome _temp._ St. Cyprian, it was so\r\n    slender. I am not certain, but does not Beugnot estimate the\r\n    Christians, before Constantine’s conversion, in the west at\r\n    one-tenth of the population? Mrs. T. Arnold died yesterday here.\r\n    Mrs. Ward had been summoned and she is coming to see me this\r\n    evening. It is a very singular phase of the controversy which she\r\n    has opened. When do you _repatriate_?\r\n\r\n    I am afraid that my kindness to the Positivists amounts only to a\r\n    comparative approval of their not dropping the great human\r\n    tradition out of view; _plus_ a very high appreciation of the\r\n    personal qualities of our friend ——.\r\n\r\n    _To Lord Acton._\r\n\r\n    _Dollis Hill, May 13, ’88._—Your last letter was one of extreme\r\n    interest. It raised such a multitude of points, after your perusal\r\n    of my article on R. Elsmere, as to stimulate in the highest degree\r\n    my curiosity to know how far you would carry into propositions,\r\n    the ideas which you for the most part obliquely put forward. I\r\n    gave the letter to Mary, who paid us a flying visit in London,\r\n    that she might take it to Hawarden for full digestion. For myself\r\n    I feed upon the hope that when (when ?) you come back to England\r\n    we may go over the points, and I may reap further benefits from\r\n    your knowledge. I will not now attempt anything of the kind. But I\r\n    will say this generally, that I am not so much oppressed as you\r\n    appear to be, with the notion that great difficulties have been\r\n    imported by the researches of scientists into the religious and\r\n    theological argument. As respects cosmogony and _geogony_, the\r\n    Scripture has, I think, taken much benefit from them. Whatever be\r\n    the date of the early books, Pentateuch or Hexateuch in their\r\n    present _edition_, the Assyriological investigations seem to me to\r\n    have fortified and accredited their substance by producing similar\r\n    traditions in variant forms inferior to the Mosaic forms, and\r\n    tending to throw them back to a higher antiquity, a fountainhead\r\n    nearer the source. Then there is the great chapter of the\r\n    Dispersal: which Renan (I think) treats as exhibiting the\r\n    marvellous genius (!) of the Jews. As to unbroken sequences in the\r\n    physical order, they do not trouble me, because we have to do not\r\n    with the natural but the moral order, and over this science, or as\r\n    I call it natural science, does not wave her sceptre. It is no\r\n    small matter, again (if so it be, as I suppose), that, after\r\n    warring for a century against miracle as unsustained by\r\n    experience, the assailants should now have to abandon that ground,\r\n    stand only upon sequence, and controvert the great facts of the\r\n    New Testament only by raising to an extravagant and unnatural\r\n    height the demands made under the law of testimony in order to\r\n    [justify] a rational belief. One admission has to be made, that\r\n    death did not come into the world by sin, namely the sin of Adam,\r\n    and this sits inconveniently by the declaration of Saint Paul.\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Ward wrote to thank me for the tone of my article. Her first\r\n    intention was to make some reply in the _Nineteenth Century_\r\n    itself. It appears that —— advised her not to do it. But Knowles\r\n    told me that he was labouring to bring her up to the scratch\r\n    again. There, I said, you show the cloven foot; you want to keep\r\n    the _Nineteenth Century_ pot boiling.\r\n\r\n    I own that your reasons for not being in England did not appear to\r\n    me cogent, but it would be impertinent to make myself a judge of\r\n    them. The worst of it was that you did not name _any_ date. But I\r\n    must assume that you are coming; and surely the time cannot now be\r\n    far. Among other things, I want to speak with you about French\r\n    novels, a subject on which there has for me been quite recently\r\n    cast a most lurid light.\r\n\r\n\r\nActon’s letters in reply may have convinced Mr. Gladstone that there were\r\ndepths in this supreme controversy that he had hardly sounded; and\r\nadversaria that he might have mocked from a professor of the school or\r\nschools of unbelief, he could not in his inner mind make light of, when\r\ncoming from the pen of a catholic believer. Before and after the article\r\non _Robert Elsmere_ appeared, Acton, the student with his vast historic\r\nknowledge and his deep penetrating gaze, warned the impassioned critic of\r\nsome historic point overstated or understated, some dangerous breach left\r\nall unguarded, some lack of nicety in definition. Acton’s letters will one\r\nday see the light, and the reader may then know how candidly Mr. Gladstone\r\nwas admonished as to the excess of his description of the moral action of\r\nChristianity; as to the risk of sending modern questions to ancient\r\nanswers, for the apologists of an age can only meet the difficulties of\r\ntheir age; that there are leaps and bounds in the history of thought; how\r\nwell did Newman once say that in theology you have to meet questions that\r\nthe Fathers could hardly have been made to understand; how if you go to\r\nSt. Thomas or Leibnitz or Paley for rescue from Hegel or Haeckel your\r\napologetics will be a record of disaster. You insist broadly, says Acton,\r\non belief in the divine nature of Christ as the soul, substance, and\r\ncreative force of Christian religion; you assign to it very much of the\r\ngood the church has done; all this with little or no qualification or\r\ndrawback from the other side:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Enter Martineau or Stephen or —— (unattached), and loq.:—Is this\r\n    the final judgment of the chief of liberals? the pontiff of a\r\n    church whose fathers are the later Milton and the later Penn,\r\n    Locke, Bayle, Toland, Franklin, Turgot, Adam Smith, Washington,\r\n    Jefferson, Bentham, Dugald Stewart, Romilly, Tocqueville,\r\n    Channing, Macaulay, Mill? These men and others like them\r\n    disbelieved that doctrine established freedom, and they undid the\r\n    work of orthodox Christianity, they swept away that appalling\r\n    edifice of intolerance, tyranny, cruelty, which believers in\r\n    Christ built up to perpetuate their belief.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of liberal history, Acton proceeds, which has to\r\nacknowledge the invaluable services of early Christianity, feels the\r\nanti-liberal and anti-social action of later Christianity, before the rise\r\nof the sects that rejected, some of them the divinity of Christ; others,\r\nthe institutions of the church erected upon it. Liberalism if it admits\r\nthese things as indifferent, surrenders its own _raison d’être_, and\r\nceases to strive for an ethical cause. If the doctrine of Torquemada make\r\nus condone his morality, there can be no public right and no wrong, no\r\npolitical sin, no secular cause to die for. So it might be said that—\r\n\r\n\r\n    You do not work really from the principle of liberalism, but from\r\n    the cognate, though distinct principles of democracy, nationality,\r\n    progress, etc. To some extent, I fear, you will estrange valued\r\n    friends, not assuredly by any expression of theological belief,\r\n    but by seeming to ignore the great central problem of Christian\r\n    politics. If I had to put my own doubts, instead of the average\r\n    liberal’s, I should state the case in other words, but not\r\n    altogether differently.(218)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II. The Alternative Policy In Act. (1886-1888)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Those who come over hither to us from England, and some weak\r\n    people among ourselves, whenever in discourse we make mention of\r\n    liberty and property, shake their heads, and tell us that “Ireland\r\n    is a depending kingdom,” as if they would seem by this phrase to\r\n    intend, that the people of Ireland are in some state of slavery or\r\n    dependence different from those of England.—JONATHAN SWIFT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the ministry that succeeded Mr. Gladstone in 1886, Sir Michael Hicks\r\nBeach undertook for the second time the office of Irish secretary, while\r\nLord Randolph Churchill filled his place at the exchequer and as leader of\r\nthe House. The new Irish policy was to open with the despatch of a\r\ndistinguished soldier to put down moonlighters in Kerry; the creation of\r\none royal commission under Lord Cowper, to inquire into land rents and\r\nland purchase; and another to inquire into the country’s material\r\nresources. The two commissions were well-established ways of marking time.\r\nAs for Irish industries and Irish resources, a committee of the House of\r\nCommons had made a report in a blue book of a thousand pages only a year\r\nbefore. On Irish land there had been a grand commission in 1880, and a\r\ncommittee of the House of Lords in 1882-3. The latest Purchase Act was\r\nhardly yet a year old. Then to commission a general to hunt down little\r\nhandfuls of peasants who with blackened faces and rude firearms crept\r\nstealthily in the dead of night round lonely cabins in the remote\r\nhillsides and glens of Kerry, was hardly more sensible than it would be to\r\nsend a squadron of life-guards to catch pickpockets in a London slum.\r\n\r\nA question that exercised Mr. Gladstone at least as sharply as the\r\nproceedings of ministers, was the attitude (M129) to be taken by those who\r\nhad quitted him, ejected him in the short parliament of 1886, and fought\r\nthe election against him. We have seen how much controversy arose long\r\nyears before as to the question whereabouts in the House of Commons the\r\nPeelites should take their seats.(219) The same perplexity now confronted\r\nthe liberals who did not agree with Mr. Gladstone upon Irish government.\r\nLord Hartington wrote to him, and here is his reply:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _August 2, 1886._—I fully appreciate the feeling which has\r\n    prompted your letter, and I admit the reality of the difficulties\r\n    you describe. It is also clear, I think, that so far as title to\r\n    places on the front opposition bench is concerned, your right to\r\n    them is identical with ours. I am afraid, however, that I cannot\r\n    materially contribute to relieve you from embarrassment. The\r\n    choice of a seat is more or less the choice of a symbol; and I\r\n    have no such acquaintance with your political views and\r\n    intentions, as could alone enable me to judge what materials I\r\n    have before me for making an answer to your inquiry. For my own\r\n    part, I earnestly desire, subject to the paramount exigencies of\r\n    the Irish question, to promote in every way the reunion of the\r\n    liberal party; a desire in which I earnestly trust that you\r\n    participate. And I certainly could not directly or indirectly\r\n    dissuade you from any step which you may be inclined to take, and\r\n    which may appear to you to have a tendency in any measure to\r\n    promote that end.\r\n\r\n\r\nA singular event occurred at the end of the year (1886), that produced an\r\nimportant change in the relations of this group of liberals to the\r\ngovernment that they had placed and maintained in power. Lord Randolph,\r\nthe young minister who with such extraordinary rapidity had risen to\r\nascendency in the councils of the government, suddenly in a fatal moment\r\nof miscalculation or caprice resigned (Dec. 23). Political suicide is not\r\neasy to a man with energy and resolution, but this was one of the rare\r\ncases. In a situation so strangely unstable and irregular, with an\r\nadministration resting on the support of a section sitting on benches\r\nopposite, and still declaring every day that they adhered to old liberal\r\nprinciples and had no wish to sever old party ties, the withdrawal of Lord\r\nRandolph Churchill created boundless perturbation. It was one of those\r\nexquisite moments in which excited politicians enjoy the ineffable\r\nsensation that the end of the world has come. Everything seemed possible.\r\nLord Hartington was summoned from the shores of the Mediterranean, but\r\nbeing by temperament incredulous of all vast elemental convulsions, he\r\ntook his time. On his return he declined Lord Salisbury’s offer to make\r\nway for him as head of the government. The glitter of the prize might have\r\ntempted a man of schoolboy ambition, but Lord Hartington was too\r\nexperienced in affairs not to know that to be head of a group that held\r\nthe balance was, under such equivocal circumstances, far the more\r\nsubstantial and commanding position of the two. Mr. Goschen’s case was\r\ndifferent, and by taking the vacant post at the exchequer he saved the\r\nprime minister from the necessity of going back under Lord Randolph’s\r\nyoke. As it happened, all this gave a shake to both of the unionist wings.\r\nThe ominous clouds of coercion were sailing slowly but discernibly along\r\nthe horizon, and this made men in the unionist camp still more restless\r\nand uneasy. Mr. Chamberlain, on the very day of the announcement of the\r\nChurchill resignation, had made a speech that was taken to hold out an\r\nolive branch to his old friends. Sir William Harcourt, ever holding\r\nstoutly in fair weather and in foul to the party ship, thought the\r\nbreak-up of a great political combination to be so immense an evil, as to\r\ncall for almost any sacrifices to prevent it. He instantly wrote to\r\nBirmingham to express his desire to co-operate in re-union, and in the\r\ncourse of a few days five members of the original liberal cabinet of 1886\r\nmet at his house in what was known as the Round Table Conference.(220)\r\n\r\nA letter of Mr. Gladstone’s to me puts some of his views on the situation\r\ncreated by the retirement of Lord Randolph:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Hawarden, Christmas Day, 1886._—Between Christmas services, a\r\n    flood of cards and congratulations for the season, and many\r\n    interesting letters, I am drowned in work to-day, having just at\r\n    1-¼ P.M. ascertained what my letters _are_. So forgive me if,\r\n    first thanking you very much for yours, I deal with some points\r\n    rather abruptly.\r\n\r\n    1. Churchill has committed an outrage as against the Queen, and\r\n    also the prime minister, in the method of resigning and making\r\n    known his resignation. This, of course, they will work against\r\n    him. 2. He is also entirely wrong in supposing that the finance\r\n    minister has any ruling authority on the great estimates of\r\n    defence. If he had, he would be the master of the country. But\r\n    although he has no right to demand the concurrence of his\r\n    colleagues in his view of the estimates, he has a rather special\r\n    right, because these do so much towards determining budget and\r\n    taxation, to indicate his own views by resignation. I have\r\n    repeatedly fought estimates to the extremity, with an intention of\r\n    resigning in _case_. But to send in a resignation makes it\r\n    impossible for his colleagues as men of honour to recede. 3. I\r\n    think one of his best points is that he had made before taking\r\n    office recent and formal declarations on behalf of economy, of\r\n    which his colleagues must be taken to have been cognisant, and\r\n    Salisbury in particular. He may plead that he could not reduce\r\n    these all at once to zero. 4. Cannot something be done, without\r\n    reference to the holes that may be picked, to give him some\r\n    support as a champion of economy? This talk about the continental\r\n    war, I for one regard as pure nonsense when aimed at magnifying\r\n    our estimates.\r\n\r\n    5. With regard to Hartington. What he will do I know not, and our\r\n    wishes could have no weight with him.... The position is one of\r\n    such difficulty for H. that I am very sorry for him, though it was\r\n    never more true that he who makes his own bed in a certain way\r\n    must lie in it. Chamberlain’s speech hits him very hard in case of\r\n    acceptance. I take it for granted that he will not accept to sit\r\n    among thirteen tories, but will have to demand an entry by force,\r\n    _i.e._ with three or four friends. To accept upon that footing\r\n    would, I think, be the logical consequence of all he has said and\r\n    done since April. In logic, he ought to go forward, _or_, as\r\n    Chamberlain has done, backward. The Queen will, I have no doubt,\r\n    be brought to bear upon him, and the nine-tenths of his order. If\r\n    the Irish question rules all others, all he has to consider is\r\n    whether he (properly flanked) can serve his view of the Irish\r\n    question. But with this logic we have nothing to do. The question\r\n    for us also is (I think), what is best for our view of the Irish\r\n    question? I am tempted to wish that he should accept; it would\r\n    clear the ground. But I do not yet see my way with certainty.\r\n\r\n    6. With regard to Chamberlain. From what has already passed\r\n    between us you know that, apart from the new situation and from\r\n    his declaration, I was very desirous that everything honourable\r\n    should be done to conciliate and soothe. Unquestionably his speech\r\n    is a new fact of great weight. He is again a liberal, _quand\r\n    même_, and will not on all points (as good old Joe Hume used to\r\n    say) swear black is white for the sake of his views on Ireland. We\r\n    ought not to waste this new fact, but take careful account of it.\r\n    On the other hand, I think he will see that the moment for taking\r\n    account of it has not come. Clearly the first thing is to see who\r\n    are the government. When we see this, we shall also know something\r\n    of its colour and intentions. I do not think Randolph can go back.\r\n    He would go back at a heavy discount. If he wants to minimise, the\r\n    only way I see is that he should isolate his vote on the\r\n    estimates, form no _clique_, and proclaim strong support in Irish\r\n    matters and general policy. Thus he might pave a roundabout road\r\n    of return.... In _many_ things Goschen is more of a liberal than\r\n    Hartington, and he would carry with him next to nobody.\r\n\r\n    7. On the whole, I rejoice to think that, come what may, this\r\n    affair will really effect progress in the Irish question.\r\n\r\n    A happy Christmas to you. It will be happier than that of the\r\n    ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone gave the Round Table his blessing, his “general idea being\r\nthat he had better meddle as little as possible with the conference, and\r\nretain a free hand.” Lord Hartington would neither join the conference,\r\nnor deny that he thought it premature. While negotiation was going on, he\r\nsaid, somebody must stay at home, guard the position, and keep a watch on\r\nthe movements of the enemy, and this duty was his. In truth, after\r\nencouraging or pressing Mr. (M130) Goschen to join the government, it was\r\nobviously impossible to do anything that would look like desertion either\r\nof him or of them. On the other side, both English liberals and Irish\r\nnationalists were equally uneasy lest the unity of the party should be\r\nbought by the sacrifice of fundamentals. The conference was denounced from\r\nthis quarter as an attempt to find a compromise that would help a few men\r\nsitting on the fence to salve “their consciences at the expense of a\r\nnation’s rights.” Such remarks are worth quoting, to illustrate the temper\r\nof the rank and file. Mr. Parnell, though alive to the truth that when\r\npeople go into a conference it usually means that they are ready to give\r\nup something, was thoroughly awake to the satisfactory significance of the\r\nBirmingham overtures.\r\n\r\nThings at the round table for some time went smoothly enough. Mr.\r\nChamberlain gradually advanced the whole length. He publicly committed\r\nhimself to the expediency of establishing some kind of legislative\r\nauthority in Dublin in accordance with Mr. Gladstone’s principle, with a\r\npreference in his own mind for a plan on the lines of Canada. This he\r\nfollowed up, also in public, by the admission that of course the Irish\r\nlegislature must be allowed to organise their own form of executive\r\ngovernment, either by an imitation on a small scale of all that goes on at\r\nWestminster and Whitehall, or in whatever other shape they might think\r\nproper.(221) To assent to an Irish legislature for such affairs as\r\nparliament might determine to be distinctively Irish, with an executive\r\nresponsible to it, was to accept the party credo on the subject. Then the\r\nsurface became mysteriously ruffled. Language was used by some of the\r\nplenipotentiaries in public, of which each side in turn complained as\r\ninconsistent with conciliatory negotiation in private. At last on the very\r\nday on which the provisional result of the conference was laid before Mr.\r\nGladstone, there appeared in a print called the _Baptist_(222) an article\r\nfrom Mr. Chamberlain, containing an ardent plea for the disestablishment\r\nof the Welsh church, but warning the Welshmen that they and the Scotch\r\ncrofters and the English labourers, thirty-two millions of people, must\r\nall go without much-needed, legislation because three millions were\r\ndisloyal, while nearly six hundred members of parliament would be reduced\r\nto forced inactivity, because some eighty delegates, representing the\r\npolicy and receiving the pay of the Chicago convention, were determined to\r\nobstruct all business until their demands had been conceded. Men naturally\r\nasked what was the use of continuing a discussion, when one party to it\r\nwas attacking in this peremptory fashion the very persons and the policy\r\nthat in private he was supposed to accept. Mr. Gladstone showed no\r\nimplacability. Viewing the actual character of the _Baptist_ letter, he\r\nsaid to Sir W. Harcourt, “I am inclined to think we can hardly do more\r\nnow, than to say we fear it has interposed an unexpected obstacle in the\r\nway of any attempt at this moment to sum up the result of your\r\ncommunications, which we should otherwise hopefully have done; but on the\r\nother hand we are unwilling that so much ground apparently gained should\r\nbe lost, that a little time may soften or remove the present ruffling of\r\nthe surface, and that we are quite willing that the subject should stand\r\nover for resumption at a convenient season.”\r\n\r\nThe resumption never happened. Two or three weeks later, Mr. Chamberlain\r\nannounced that he did not intend to return to the round table.(223) No\r\nother serious and formal attempt was ever made on either side to prevent\r\nthe liberal unionists from hardening into a separate species. When they\r\nbecame accomplices in coercion, they cut off the chances of re-union.\r\nCoercion was the key to the new situation. Just as at the beginning of\r\n1886, the announcement of it by the tory government marked the parting of\r\nthe ways, so was it now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must now with reasonable cheerfulness turn our faces back towards\r\nIreland. On the day of his return from (M131) Ireland (August 17, 1886)\r\nMr. Parnell told me that he was quite sure that rents could not be paid in\r\nthe coming winter, and if the country was to be kept quiet, the government\r\nwould have to do something. He hoped that they would do something;\r\notherwise there would be disturbance, and that he did not want. He had\r\nmade up his mind that his interests would be best served by a quiet\r\nwinter. For one thing he knew that disturbance would be followed by\r\ncoercion, and he knew and often said that of course strong coercion must\r\nalways in the long run win the day, little as the victory might be worth.\r\nFor another thing he apprehended that disturbance might frighten away his\r\nnew political allies in Great Britain, and destroy the combination which\r\nhe had so dexterously built up. This was now a dominant element with him.\r\nHe desired definitely that the next stage of his movement should be in the\r\nlargest sense political and not agrarian. He brought two or three sets of\r\nproposals in this sense before the House, and finally produced a Tenants\r\nRelief bill. It was not brilliantly framed. For in truth it is not in\r\nhuman nature, either Irish or any other, to labour the framing of a bill\r\nwhich has no chance of being seriously considered.\r\n\r\nThe golden secret of Irish government was always to begin by trying to\r\nfind all possible points for disagreement with anything that Mr. Parnell\r\nsaid or proposed, instead of seeking whether what he said or proposed\r\nmight not furnish a basis for agreement. The conciliatory tone was soon\r\nover, and the Parnell bill was thrown out. The Irish secretary denounced\r\nit as permanently upsetting the settlement of 1881, as giving a death-blow\r\nto purchase, and as produced without the proof of any real grounds for a\r\ngeneral reduction in judicial rents. Whatever else he did, said Sir\r\nMichael Hicks Beach, he would never agree to govern Ireland by a policy of\r\nblackmail.(224)\r\n\r\nA serious movement followed the failure of the government to grapple with\r\narrears of rent. The policy known as the plan of campaign was launched.\r\nThe plan of campaign was this. The tenants of a given estate agreed with\r\none another what abatement they thought just in the current half-year’s\r\nrent. This in a body they proffered to landlord or agent. If it was\r\nrefused as payment in full, they handed the money to a managing committee,\r\nand the committee deposited it with some person in whom they had\r\nconfidence, to be used for the purpose of the struggle.(225) That such\r\nproceeding constituted an unlawful conspiracy nobody doubts, any more than\r\nit can be doubted that before the Act of 1875 every trade combination of a\r\nlike kind in this island was a conspiracy.\r\n\r\nAt an early stage the Irish leader gave his opinion to the present\r\nwriter:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Dec. 7, 1886._—Mr. Parnell called, looking very ill and worn. He\r\n    wished to know what I thought of the effect of the plan of\r\n    campaign upon public opinion. “If you mean in Ireland,” I said,\r\n    “of course I have no view, and it would be worth nothing if I had.\r\n    In England, the effect is wholly bad; it offends almost more even\r\n    than outrages.” He said he had been very ill and had taken no\r\n    part, so that he stands free and uncommitted. He was anxious to\r\n    have it fully understood that the fixed point in his tactics is to\r\n    maintain the alliance with the English liberals. He referred with\r\n    much bitterness, and very justifiable too, to the fact that when\r\n    Ireland seemed to be quiet some short time back, the government\r\n    had at once begun to draw away from all their promises of remedial\r\n    legislation. If now rents were paid, meetings abandoned, and\r\n    newspapers moderated, the same thing would happen over again as\r\n    usual. However, he would send for a certain one of his\r\n    lieutenants, and would press for an immediate cessation of the\r\n    violent speeches.\r\n\r\n    _December 12._—Mr. Parnell came, and we had a prolonged\r\n    conversation. The lieutenant had come over, and had defended the\r\n    plan of campaign. Mr. Parnell persevered in his dissent and\r\n    disapproval, and they parted with the understanding that the\r\n    meetings should be dropped, and the movement calmed as much as\r\n    could be. I told him that I had heard from Mr. Gladstone, and that\r\n    he could not possibly show any tolerance for illegalities.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat his opponents should call upon Mr. Gladstone to denounce the plan of\r\ncampaign and cut himself off from its authors, was to be expected. They\r\nmade the most of it. (M132) But he was the last man to be turned aside\r\nfrom the prosecution of a policy that he deemed of overwhelming moment, by\r\nany minor currents. Immediately after the election, Mr. Parnell had been\r\ninformed of his view that it would be a mistake for English and Irish to\r\naim at uniform action in parliament. Motives could not be at all points\r\nthe same. Liberals were bound to keep in view (next to what the Irish\r\nquestion might require) the reunion of the liberal party. The Irish were\r\nbound to have special regard to the opinion and circumstances of Ireland.\r\nCommon action up to a certain degree would arise from the necessities of\r\nthe position. Such was Mr. Gladstone’s view. He was bent on bringing a\r\nrevolutionary movement to what he confidently anticipated would be a good\r\nend; to allow a passing phase of that movement to divert him, would be to\r\nabandon his own foundations. No reformer is fit for his task who suffers\r\nhimself to be frightened off by the excesses of an extreme wing.\r\n\r\nIn reply to my account of the conversation with Mr. Parnell, he wrote to\r\nme:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Hawarden, December 8, 1886._—I have received your very clear\r\n    statement and reply in much haste for the post—making the same\r\n    request as yours for a return. I am glad to find the —— speech is\r\n    likely to be neutralised, I hope effectually. It was really very\r\n    bad. I am glad you write to ——. 2. As to the campaign in Ireland,\r\n    I do not at present feel the force of Hartington’s appeal to me to\r\n    speak out. I do not recollect that he ever spoke out about\r\n    Churchill, of whom he is for the time the enthusiastic\r\n    follower.(226) 3. But all I say and do must be kept apart from the\r\n    slightest countenance direct or indirect to illegality. We too\r\n    suffer under the power of the landlord, but we cannot adopt this\r\n    as a method of breaking it. 4. I am glad you opened the question\r\n    of intermediate measures.... 5. Upon the whole I suppose he sees\r\n    he cannot have countenance from us in the plan of campaign. The\r\n    question rather is how much disavowal. I have contradicted a tory\r\n    figment in Glasgow that I had approved.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a later date (September 16, 1887) he wrote to me as to an intended\r\nspeech at Newcastle: “You will, I have no doubt, press even more earnestly\r\nthan before on the Irish people the duty and policy of maintaining order,\r\nand in these instances I shall be very glad if you will associate me with\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\n“The plan of campaign,” said Mr. Gladstone, “was one of those devices that\r\ncannot be reconciled with the principles of law and order in a civilised\r\ncountry. Yet we all know that such devices are the certain result of\r\nmisgovernment. With respect to this particular instance, if the plan be\r\nblameable (I cannot deny that I feel it difficult to acquit any such plan)\r\nI feel its authors are not one-tenth part so blameable as the government\r\nwhose contemptuous refusal of what they have now granted, was the parent\r\nand source of the mischief.”(227) This is worth looking at.\r\n\r\nThe Cowper Commission, in February 1887, reported that refusal by some\r\nlandlords explained much that had occurred in the way of combination, and\r\nthat the growth of these combinations had been facilitated by the fall in\r\nprices, restriction of credit by the banks, and other circumstances making\r\nthe payment of rent impossible.(228) Remarkable evidence was given by Sir\r\nRedvers Buller. He thought there should be some means of modifying and\r\nredressing the grievance of rents being still higher than the people can\r\npay. “You have got a very ignorant poor people, and the law should look\r\nafter them, instead of which it has only looked after the rich.”(229) This\r\nwas exactly what Mr. Parnell had said. In the House the government did not\r\nbelieve him; in Ireland they admitted his case to be true. In one instance\r\nGeneral Buller wrote to the agents of the estate that he believed it was\r\nimpossible for the tenants to pay the rent that was demanded; there might\r\nbe five or six rogues among them, but in his opinion the greater number of\r\nthem were nearer famine than paying rent.(230) In this very case ruthless\r\nevictions followed. The same scenes were enacted elsewhere. The landlords\r\nwere within their rights, the courts were bound by the law, the police had\r\nno choice but to back (M133) the courts. The legal ease was complete. The\r\nmoral case remained, and it was through these barbarous scenes that in a\r\nrough and non-logical way the realities of the Irish land system for the\r\nfirst time gained access to the minds of the electors of Great Britain.\r\nSuch devices as the plan of campaign came to be regarded in England and\r\nScotland as what they were, incidents in a great social struggle. In a\r\nvast majority of cases the mutineers succeeded in extorting a reduction of\r\nrent, not any more immoderate than the reduction voluntarily made by good\r\nlandlords, or decreed in the land-courts. No agrarian movement in Ireland\r\nwas ever so unstained by crime.\r\n\r\nSome who took part in these affairs made no secret of political motives.\r\nUnlike Mr. Parnell, they deliberately desired to make government\r\ndifficult. Others feared that complete inaction would give an opening to\r\nthe Fenian extremists. This section had already shown some signs both of\r\ntheir temper and their influence in certain proceedings of the Gaelic\r\nassociation at Thurles. But the main spring was undoubtedly agrarian, and\r\nthe force of the spring came from mischiefs that ministers had refused to\r\nface in time. “What they call a conspiracy now,” said one of the insurgent\r\nleaders, “they will call an Act of parliament next year.” So it turned\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe Commission felt themselves “constrained to recommend an earlier\r\nrevision of judicial rents, on account of the straitened circumstances of\r\nIrish farmers.” What the commissioners thus told ministers in the spring\r\nwas exactly what the Irish leader had told them in the previous autumn.\r\nThey found that there were “real grounds” for some legislation of the kind\r\nthat the chief secretary, unconscious of what his cabinet was so rapidly\r\nto come to, had stigmatised as the policy of blackmail.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of March 1887, the government felt the necessity of\r\nintroducing a measure based on facts that they had disputed, and on\r\nprinciples that they had repudiated. Leaseholders were admitted, some\r\nhundred thousand of them. That is, the more solemn of the forms of\r\nagrarian contract were set aside. Other provisions we may pass over. But\r\nthis was not the bill to which the report of the Commission pointed. The\r\npith of that report was the revision and abatement of judicial rents, and\r\nfrom the new bill this vital point was omitted. It could hardly have been\r\notherwise after a curt declaration made by the prime minister in the\r\nprevious August. “We do not contemplate any revision of judicial rents,”\r\nhe said—immediately, by the way, after appointing a commission to find out\r\nwhat it was that they ought to contemplate. “We do not think it would be\r\nhonest in the first place, and we think it would be exceedingly\r\ninexpedient.”(231) He now repeated that to interfere with judicial rents\r\nbecause prices had fallen, would be to “lay your axe to the root of the\r\nfabric of civilised society.”(232) Before the bill was introduced, Mr.\r\nBalfour, who had gone to the Irish office on the retirement of Sir M. H.\r\nBeach in the month of March, proclaimed in language even more fervid, that\r\nit would be folly and madness to break these solemn contracts.(233)\r\n\r\nFor that matter, the bill even as it first stood was in direct\r\ncontravention to all such high doctrine as this, inasmuch as it clothed a\r\ncourt with power to vary solemn contracts by fixing a composition for\r\noutstanding debt, and spreading the payment of it over such a time as the\r\njudge might think fit. That, however, was the least part of what finally\r\novertook the haughty language of the month of April. In May the government\r\naccepted a proposal that the court should not only settle the sum due by\r\nan applicant for relief for outstanding debt, but should fix a reasonable\r\nrent for the rest of the term. This was the very power of variation that\r\nministers had, as it were only the day before, so roundly denounced. But\r\nthen the tenants in Ulster were beginning to growl. In June ministers\r\nwithdrew the power of variation, for now it was the landlords who were\r\ngrowling. Then at last in July the prime minister called his party\r\ntogether, and told them that if the bill were not altered, Ulster would be\r\nlost to the unionist cause, and that after all he must put into the bill a\r\ngeneral revision of judicial rents for three years. So finally, as it was\r\nput by a speaker of that time, (M134) you have the prime minister\r\nrejecting in April the policy which in May he accepts; rejecting in June\r\nthe policy which he had accepted in May; and then in July accepting the\r\npolicy which he had rejected in June, and which had been within a few\r\nweeks declared by himself and his colleagues to be inexpedient and\r\ndishonest, to be madness and folly, and to be a laying of the axe to the\r\nvery root of the fabric of civilised society. The simplest recapitulation\r\nmade the bitterest satire.\r\n\r\nThe law that finally emerged from these singular operations dealt, it will\r\nbe observed in passing, with nothing less than the chief object of Irish\r\nindustry and the chief form of Irish property. No wonder that the\r\nlandlords lifted up angry voices. True, the minister the year before had\r\nlaid it down that if rectification of rents should be proved necessary,\r\nthe landlords ought to be compensated by the state. Of this consolatory\r\nbalm it is needless to say no more was ever heard; it was only a graceful\r\nsentence in a speech, and proved to have little relation to purpose or\r\nintention. At the Kildare Street club in Dublin members moodily asked one\r\nanother whether they might not just as well have had the policy of Mr.\r\nParnell’s bill adopted on College Green, as adopted at Westminster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moment had by this time once more come for testing the proposition\r\nfrom which Mr. Gladstone’s policy had first started. The tory government\r\nhad been turned out at the beginning of 1886 upon coercion, and Mr.\r\nGladstone’s government had in the summer of that year been beaten upon\r\nconciliation. “I ventured to state in 1886,” said Mr. Gladstone a year\r\nlater,(234) “that we had arrived at the point where two roads met, or\r\nrather where two roads parted; one of them the road that marked the\r\nendeavour to govern Ireland according to its constitutionally expressed\r\nwishes; the other the road principally marked by ultra-constitutional\r\nmeasures, growing more and more pronounced in character.” Others, he said,\r\nwith whom we had been in close alliance down to that date, considered that\r\na third course was open, namely liberal concession, stopping short of\r\nautonomy, but upon a careful avoidance of coercion. Now it became visible\r\nthat this was a mistake, and that in default of effective conciliation,\r\ncoercion was the inevitable alternative. So it happened.\r\n\r\nThe government again unlocked the ancient armoury, and brought out the\r\nwell-worn engines. The new Crimes bill in most particulars followed the\r\nold Act, but it contained one or two serious extensions, including a\r\nclause afterwards dropped, that gave to the crown a choice in cases of\r\nmurder or certain other aggravated offences of carrying the prisoner out\r\nof his own country over to England and trying him before a Middlesex jury\r\nat the Old Bailey—a puny imitation of the heroic expedient suggested in\r\n1769, of bringing American rebels over for trial in England under a\r\nslumbering statute of King Henry VIII. The most startling innovation of\r\nall was that the new Act was henceforth to be the permanent law of\r\nIreland, and all its drastic provisions were to be brought into force\r\nwhenever the executive government pleased.(235) This Act was not\r\nrestricted as every former law of the kind had been in point of time, to\r\nmeet an emergency; it was made a standing instrument of government.\r\nCriminal law and procedure is one of the most important of all the\r\nbranches of civil rule, and certainly is one of the most important of all\r\nits elements. This was now in Ireland to shift up and down, to be one\r\nthing to-day and another thing to-morrow at executive discretion. Acts\r\nwould be innocent or would be crimes, just as it pleased the Irish\r\nminister. Parliament did not enact that given things were criminal, but\r\nonly that they should be criminal when an Irish minister should choose to\r\nsay so.(236) Persons charged with them would have the benefit of a jury or\r\nwould be deprived of a jury, as the Irish minister might think proper.\r\n\r\n(M135) Mr. Parnell was in bad health and took little part, but he made\r\nmore than one pulverising attack in that measured and frigid style which,\r\nin a man who knows his case at first hand, may be so much more awkward for\r\na minister than more florid onslaughts. He discouraged obstruction, and\r\nadvised his followers to select vital points and to leave others alone.\r\nThis is said to have been the first Coercion bill that a majority of Irish\r\nmembers voting opposed.\r\n\r\nIt was at this point that the government suddenly introduced their\r\nhistoric proposal for closure by guillotine. They carried (June 10) a\r\nresolution that at ten o’clock on that day week the committee stage should\r\nbe brought compulsorily to an end, and that any clauses remaining\r\nundisposed of should be put forthwith without amendment or debate. The\r\nmost remarkable innovation upon parliamentary rule and practice since\r\nCromwell and Colonel Pride, was introduced by Mr. Smith in a\r\ncharacteristic speech, well larded with phrases about duty, right,\r\nresponsibility, business of the country, and efficiency of the House.\r\nThese solemnising complacencies’ did not hide the mortifying fact that if\r\nit had really been one of the objects of Irish members for ten years past\r\nto work a revolution in the parliament where they were forced against\r\ntheir will to sit, they had at least, be such a revolution good or bad,\r\nsucceeded in their design.\r\n\r\nPerhaps looking forward with prophetic eye to a day that actually arrived\r\nsix years later, Mr. Gladstone, while objecting to the proposal as\r\nunjustified, threw the responsibility of it upon the government, and used\r\nnone of the flaming colours of defiance. The bulk of the liberals\r\nabstained from the division. This practical accord between the two sets of\r\nleading men made the parliamentary revolution definite and finally\r\nclenched it. It was not without something of a funereal pang that members\r\nwith a sense of the old traditions of the power, solemnity, and honour of\r\nthe House of Commons came down on the evening of the seventeenth of June.\r\nWithin a week they would be celebrating the fiftieth year of the reign of\r\nthe Queen, and that night’s business was the strange and unforeseen goal\r\nat which a journey of little more than the same period of time along the\r\nhigh, democratic road had brought the commonalty of the realm since 1832.\r\nAmong the provisions that went into the bill without any discussion in\r\ncommittee were those giving to the Irish executive the power of stamping\r\nan association as unlawful; those dealing with special juries and change\r\nof the place of trial; those specifying the various important conditions\r\nattaching to proclamations, which lay at the foundation of the Act; those\r\ndealing with rules, procedure, and the limits of penalty. The report next\r\nfell under what Burke calls the accursed slider. That stage had taken\r\nthree sittings, when the government moved (June 30) that it must close in\r\nfour days. So much grace, however, was not needed; for after the motion\r\nhad been carried the liberals withdrew from the House, and the Irishmen\r\nbetook themselves to the galleries, whence they looked down upon the\r\nmechanical proceedings below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Ireland the battle now began in earnest. The Irish minister went into\r\nit with intrepid logic. Though very different men in the deeper parts of\r\ncharacter, Macaulay’s account of Halifax would not be an ill-natured\r\naccount of Mr. Balfour. “His understanding was keen, sceptical,\r\ninexhaustibly fertile in distinctions and objections, his taste refined,\r\nhis sense of the ludicrous exquisite; his temper placid and forgiving, but\r\nfastidious, and by no means prone either to malevolence or to enthusiastic\r\nadmiration.” His business was to show disaffected Ireland that parliament\r\nwas her master. Parliament had put the weapon into his hands, and it was\r\nfor him to smite his antagonists to the ground. He made no experiments in\r\njudicious mixture, hard blows and soft speech, but held steadily to force\r\nand fear. His apologists argued that after all substantial justice was\r\ndone even in what seemed hard cases, and even if the spirit of law were\r\nsometimes a trifle strained. Unluckily the peasant with the blunderbuss,\r\nas he waits behind the hedge for the tyrant or the traitor, says just the\r\nsame. The forces of disorder were infinitely less formidable than they had\r\nbeen a hundred times before. The contest was child’s play compared with\r\n(M136) the violence and confusion with which Mr. Forster or Lord Spencer\r\nhad to deal. On the other hand the alliance between liberals and Irish\r\ngave to the struggle a parliamentary complexion, by which no coercion\r\nstruggle had ever been marked hitherto. In the dialectic of senate and\r\nplatform, Mr. Balfour displayed a strength of wrist, a rapidity, an\r\ninstant readiness for combat, that took his foes by surprise, and roused\r\nin his friends a delight hardly surpassed in the politics of our day.\r\n\r\nThere was another important novelty this time. To England hitherto Irish\r\ncoercion had been little more than a word of common form, used without any\r\nthought what the thing itself was like to the people coerced. Now it was\r\ndifferent. Coercion had for once become a flaming party issue, and when\r\nthat happens all the world awakes. Mr. Gladstone had proclaimed that the\r\nchoice lay between conciliation and coercion. The country would have liked\r\nconciliation, but did not trust his plan. When coercion came, the two\r\nBritish parties rushed to their swords, and the deciding body of neutrals\r\nlooked on with anxiety and concern. There has never been a more\r\nstrenuously sustained contest in the history of political campaigns. No\r\neffort was spared to bring the realities of repression vividly home to the\r\njudgment and feelings of men and women of our own island. English visitors\r\ntrooped over to Ireland, and brought back stories of rapacious landlords,\r\nviolent police, and famishing folk cast out homeless upon the wintry\r\nroadside. Irishmen became the most welcome speakers on British platforms,\r\nand for the first time in all our history they got a hearing for their\r\nlamentable tale. To English audiences it was as new and interesting as the\r\nnarrative of an African explorer or a navigator in the Pacific. Our Irish\r\ninstructors even came to the curious conclusion that ordinary\r\ninternational estimates must be revised, and that Englishmen are in truth\r\nfar more emotional than Irishmen. Ministerial speakers, on the other hand,\r\ndiligently exposed inaccuracy here or over-colouring there. They appealed\r\nto the English distaste for disorder, and to the English taste for\r\nmastery, and they did not overlook the slumbering jealousy of popery and\r\npriestcraft. But the course of affairs was too rapid for them, the strong\r\nharsh doses to the Irish patient were too incessant. The Irish convictions\r\nin cases where the land was concerned rose to 2805, and of these rather\r\nover one-half were in cases where in England the rights of the prisoner\r\nwould have been guarded by a jury. The tide of common popular feeling in\r\nthis island about the right to combine, the right of public meeting, the\r\nfrequent barbarities of eviction, the jarring indignities of prison\r\ntreatment, flowed stronger and stronger. The general impression spread\r\nmore and more widely that the Irish did not have fair play, that they were\r\nnot being treated about speeches and combination and meetings as\r\nEnglishmen or Scotchmen would be treated. Even in breasts that had been\r\nmost incensed by the sudden reversal of policy in 1886, the feeling slowly\r\ngrew that it was perhaps a pity after all that Mr. Gladstone had not been\r\nallowed to persevere on the fair-shining path of conciliation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proceedings under exceptional law would make an instructive chapter in\r\nthe history of the union. Mr. Gladstone followed them vigilantly, once or\r\ntwice without his usual exercise of critical faculty, but always bringing\r\ninto effective light the contrast between this squalid policy and his\r\nanticipations of his own. Here we are only concerned with what affected\r\nBritish opinion on the new policy. One set of distressing incidents, not\r\nconnected with the Crimes Act, created disgust and even horror in the\r\ncountry and set Mr. Gladstone on fire. A meeting of some six thousand\r\npersons assembled in a large public square at Mitchelstown in the county\r\nof Cork.(237) It was a good illustration of Mr. Gladstone’s habitual\r\nstrategy in public movements, that he should have boldly and promptly\r\nseized on the doings at Mitchelstown as an incident well fitted to arrest\r\nthe attention of the country. “Remember Mitchelstown” became a watchword.\r\nThe chairman, speaking from a carriage that did duty for a platform,\r\nopened the proceedings. Then a file of police endeavoured to force a way\r\nthrough the densest part of the (M137) crowd for a government note-taker.\r\nWhy they did not choose an easier mode of approach from the rear, or by\r\nthe side; why they had not got their reporter on to the platform before\r\nthe business began; and why they had not beforehand asked for\r\naccommodation as was the practice, were three points never explained. The\r\npolice unable to make a way through the crowd retired to the outskirt. The\r\nmeeting went on. In a few minutes a larger body of police pressed up\r\nthrough the thick of the throng to the platform. A violent struggle began,\r\nthe police fighting their way through the crowd with batons and clubbed\r\nrifles. The crowd flung stones and struck out with sticks, and after three\r\nor four minutes the police fled to their barracks—some two hundred and\r\nfifty yards away. So far there is no material discrepancy in the various\r\nversions of this dismal story. What followed is matter of conflicting\r\ntestimony. One side alleged that a furious throng rushed after the police,\r\nattacked the barrack, and half murdered a constable outside, and that the\r\nconstables inside in order to save their comrade and to beat off the\r\nassailing force, opened fire from an upper window. The other side declared\r\nthat no crowd followed the retreating police at all, that the assault on\r\nthe barrack was a myth, and that the police fired without orders from any\r\nresponsible officer, in mere blind panic and confusion. One old man was\r\nshot dead, two others were mortally wounded and died within a week.\r\n\r\nThree days later the affray was brought before the House of Commons. Any\r\none could see from the various reports that the conduct of the police, the\r\nresistance of the crowd, and the guilt or justification of the bloodshed,\r\nwere all matters in the utmost doubt and demanding rigorous inquiry. Mr.\r\nBalfour pronounced instant and peremptory judgment. The thing had happened\r\non the previous Friday. The official report, however rapidly prepared,\r\ncould not have reached him until the morning of Sunday. His officers at\r\nthe Castle had had no opportunity of testing their official report by\r\ncross-examination of the constables concerned, nor by inspection of the\r\nbarrack, the line of fire, and other material elements of the case. Yet on\r\nthe strength of this hastily drawn and unsifted report received by him\r\nfrom Ireland on Sunday, and without even waiting for any information that\r\neye-witnesses in the House might have to lay before him in the course of\r\nthe discussion, the Irish minister actually told parliament once for all,\r\non the afternoon of Monday, that he was of opinion, “looking at the matter\r\nin the most impartial spirit, that the police were in no way to blame, and\r\nthat no responsibility rested upon any one except upon those who convened\r\nthe meeting under circumstances which they knew would lead to excitement\r\nand might lead to outrage.”(238) The country was astounded to see the most\r\ncritical mind in all the House swallow an untested police report whole; to\r\nhear one of the best judges in all the country of the fallibility of human\r\ntestimony, give offhand, in what was really a charge of murder, a verdict\r\nof Not Guilty, after he had read the untested evidence on one side.\r\n\r\nThe rest was all of a piece. The coroner’s inquest was held in due course.\r\nThe proceedings were not more happily conducted than was to be expected\r\nwhere each side followed the counsels of ferocious exasperation. The jury,\r\nafter some seventeen days of it, returned a verdict of wilful murder\r\nagainst the chief police officer and five of his men. This inquisition was\r\nafterwards quashed (February 10, 1888) in the Queen’s bench, on the ground\r\nthat the coroner had perpetrated certain irregularities of form. Nobody\r\nhas doubted that the Queen’s bench was right; it seemed as if there had\r\nbeen a conspiracy of all the demons of human stupidity in this tragic\r\nbungle, from the first forcing of the reporter through the crowd, down to\r\nthe inquest on the three slain men and onwards. The coroner’s inquest\r\nhaving broken down, reasonable opinion demanded that some other public\r\ninquiry should be held. Even supporters of the government demanded it. If\r\nthree men had been killed by the police in connection with a public\r\nmeeting in England or Scotland, no home secretary would have dreamed for\r\nfive minutes of resisting such a demand. Instead of a public inquiry, what\r\nthe chief secretary did was to appoint a (M138) confidential departmental\r\ncommittee of policemen privately to examine, not whether the firing was\r\njustified by the circumstances, but how it came about that the police were\r\nso handled by their officers that a large force was put to flight by a\r\ndisorderly mob. The three deaths were treated as mere accident and\r\nirrelevance. The committee was appointed to correct the discipline of the\r\nforce, said the Irish minister, and in no sense to seek justification for\r\nactions which, in his opinion, required no justification.(239) Endless\r\nspeeches were made in the House and out of it; members went over to\r\nMitchelstown to measure distances, calculate angles, and fire imaginary\r\nrifles out of the barrack window; all sorts of theories of ricochet shots\r\nwere invented, photographs and diagrams were taken. Some held the police\r\nto be justified, others held them to be wholly unjustified. But without a\r\njudicial inquiry, such as had been set up in the case of Belfast in 1886,\r\nall these doings were futile. The government remained stubborn. The\r\nslaughter of the three men was finally left just as if it had been the\r\nslaughter of three dogs. No other incident of Irish administration stirred\r\ndeeper feelings of disgust in Ireland, or of misgiving and indignation in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nHere was, in a word, the key to the new policy. Every act of Irish\r\nofficials was to be defended. No constable could be capable of excess. No\r\nmagistrate could err. No prison rule was over harsh. Every severity\r\ntechnically in order must be politic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong other remarkable incidents, the Pope came to the rescue, and sent an\r\nemissary to inquire into Irish affairs. The government had lively hopes of\r\nthe emissary, and while they beat the Orange drum in Ulster with one hand,\r\nwith the other they stealthily twitched the sleeve of Monsignor Persico.\r\nIt came to little. The Congregation at Rome were directed by the Pope to\r\nexamine whether it was lawful to resort to the plan of campaign. They\r\nanswered that it was contrary both to natural justice and Christian\r\ncharity. The papal rescript, embodying this conclusion, was received in\r\nIreland with little docility. Unwisely the cardinals had given reasons,\r\nand the reasons, instead of springing in the mystic region of faith and\r\nmorals, turned upon issues of fact as to fair rents. But then the Irish\r\ntenant thought himself a far better judge of a fair rent, than all the\r\ncardinals that ever wore red hats. If he had heard of such a thing as\r\nJansenism, he would have known that he was in his own rude way taking up a\r\nposition not unlike that of the famous teachers of Port Royal two hundred\r\nand thirty years before, that the authority of the Holy See is final as to\r\ndoctrine, but may make a mistake as to fact.\r\n\r\nMr. Parnell spoke tranquilly of “a document from a distant country,” and\r\npublicly left the matter to his catholic countrymen.(240) Forty catholic\r\nmembers of parliament met at the Mansion House in Dublin, and signed a\r\ndocument in which they flatly denied every one of the allegations and\r\nimplications about fair rents, free contract, the land commission and all\r\nthe rest, and roundly declared the Vatican circular to be an instrument of\r\nthe unscrupulous foes both of the Holy See and of the people of Ireland.\r\nThey told the Pope, that while recognising unreservedly as catholics the\r\nspiritual jurisdiction of the Holy See, they were bound solemnly to affirm\r\nthat Irish catholics recognise no rights in Rome to interfere in their\r\npolitical affairs. A great meeting in the Phœnix Park ratified the same\r\nposition by acclamation. At Cork, under the presidency of the mayor, and\r\njealously watched by forces of horse and foot, a great gathering in a\r\nscene of indescribable excitement protested that they would never allow\r\nthe rack-renters of Ireland to grind them down at the instigation of\r\nintriguers at Rome. Even in many cities in the United States the same\r\nvoice was heard. The bishops knew well that the voice was strongly marked\r\nby the harsh accent of their Fenian adversaries. They issued a declaration\r\nof their own, protesting to their flocks that the rescript was confined\r\nwithin the spiritual sphere, and that his holiness was far from wishing to\r\nprejudice the nationalist movement. In the closing week of the year, the\r\nPope himself judged that the time had come for him to make known (M139)\r\nthat the action which had been “so sadly misunderstood,” had been prompted\r\nby the desire to keep the cause in which Ireland was struggling from being\r\nweakened by the introduction of anything that could justly be brought in\r\nreproach against it.(241) The upshot of the intervention was that the\r\naction condemned by the rescript was not materially affected within the\r\narea already disturbed; but the rescript may have done something to\r\nprevent its extension elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the entries for 1887 there occur:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Sandringham, Jan. 29._—A large party. We were received with the\r\n    usual delicacy and kindness. Much conversation with the Prince of\r\n    Wales.... Walk with ——, who charmed me much. _Jan. 31._—Off by 11\r\n    A.M. to Cambridge.... Dined with the master of Trinity in hall.\r\n    Went over the Newnham buildings: greatly pleased. Saw Mr.\r\n    Sidgwick. Evening service at King’s.... _Feb. 2._—Hawarden at\r\n    5.30. Set to work on papers. Finished Greville’s Journals. _Feb.\r\n    3._—Wrote on Greville. _Feb. 5._—Felled a chestnut. _Feb.\r\n    27._—Read Lord Shaftesbury’s _Memoirs_—an excellent discipline for\r\n    me. _March 5._— Dollis Hill [a house near Willesden often lent to\r\n    him in these times by Lord and Lady Aberdeen] a refuge from my\r\n    timidity, unwilling at 77 to begin a new London house. _March\r\n    9._—Windsor [to dine and sleep]. The Queen courteous as always;\r\n    somewhat embarrassed, as I thought. _March 29._—Worked on Homer,\r\n    Apollo, etc. Then turned to the Irish business and revolved much,\r\n    with extreme difficulty in licking the question into shape. Went\r\n    to the House and spoke 1-½ hours as carefully and with as much\r\n    measure as I could. Conclave on coming course of business. _April\r\n    5._—Conversation with Mr. Chamberlain—ambiguous result, but some\r\n    ground made. _April 18._—H. of C. 4-½-8-¼ and 10-2. Spoke 1-¼ h.\r\n    My voice did its duty but with great effort. _April 25._—Spoke for\r\n    an hour upon the budget. R. Churchill excellent. Conclave on the\r\n    forged letters. _May 4._—Read earlier speeches of yesterday with\r\n    care, and worked up the subject of Privilege. Spoke 1-¼ h.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn June (1887) Mr. Gladstone started on a political campaign in South\r\nWales, where his reception was one of the most triumphant in all his\r\ncareer. Ninety-nine hundredths of the vast crowds who gave up wages for\r\nthe sake of seeing him and doing him honour were strong protestants, yet\r\nhe said to a correspondent, “they made this demonstration in order to\r\nsecure firstly and mainly justice to catholic Ireland. It is not after all\r\na bad country in which such things take place.”\r\n\r\nIt was at Swansea that he said what he had to say about the Irish members.\r\nHe had never at any time from the hour when he formed his government, set\r\nup their exclusion as a necessary condition of home rule. All that he ever\r\nbargained for was that no proposal for inclusion should be made a ground\r\nfor impairing real and effective self-government. Subject to this he was\r\nready to adjourn the matter and to leave things as they were, until\r\nexperience should show the extent of the difficulty and the best way of\r\nmeeting it. Provisional exclusion had been suggested by a member of great\r\nweight in the party in 1886. The new formula was provisional inclusion.\r\nThis announcement restored one very distinguished adherent to Mr.\r\nGladstone, and it appeased the clamour of the busy knot who called\r\nthemselves imperial federationists. Of course it opened just as many new\r\ndifficulties as it closed old ones, but both old difficulties and new fell\r\ninto the background before the struggle in Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _June 2, 1887._—Off at 11.40. A tumultuous but interesting journey\r\n    to Swansea and Singleton, where we were landed at 7.30. Half a\r\n    dozen speeches on the way. A small party to dinner. 3.—A “quiet\r\n    day.” Wrote draft to the associations on the road, as model. Spent\r\n    the forenoon in settling plans and discussing the lines of my\r\n    meditated statement to-morrow with Sir Hussey Vivian, Lord\r\n    Aberdare, and Mr. Stuart Rendel. In the afternoon we went to the\r\n    cliffs and the Mumbles, and I gave some hours to writing\r\n    preliminary notes on a business where all depends on the manner of\r\n    handling. Small party to dinner. Read Cardiff and Swansea guides.\r\n    4.—More study and notes. 12-4-½ the astonishing procession. Sixty\r\n    thousand! Then spoke for near an hour. Dinner at 8, near an\r\n    hundred, arrangements perfect. Spoke for nearly another hour; got\r\n    through a most difficult business as well as I could expect.\r\n    5.—Church 11 A.M., notable sermon and H. C. (service long), again\r\n    6-½ P.M., good sermon. Wrote to Sir W. Harcourt, Mr. Morley, etc.\r\n    Walked in the garden. Considered the question of a non-political\r\n    address “in council”; we all decided against it. 6.—Surveys in the\r\n    house, then 12-4 to Swansea for the freedom and opening the town\r\n    library. I was rather jealous of a non-political affair at such a\r\n    time, but could not do less than speak for thirty or thirty-five\r\n    minutes for the two occasions. 4-8 to Park Farm, the beautiful\r\n    vales, breezy common and the curious chambered cairn. Small\r\n    dinner-party. 7.—Off at 8.15 and a hard day to London, the\r\n    occasion of processions, hustles, and speeches; that at Newport in\r\n    the worst atmosphere known since the Black Hole. Poor C. too was\r\n    an invalid. Spoke near an hour to 3000 at Cardiff; about ¼ hour at\r\n    Newport; more briefly at Gloucester and Swindon. Much enthusiasm\r\n    even in the English part of the journey. Our party was reduced at\r\n    Newport to the family, at Gloucester to our two selves. C. H.\r\n    Terrace at 6.20. Wrote to get off the House of Commons. It has\r\n    really been a “progress,” and an extraordinary one.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn December 1887, under the pressing advice of his physician, though “with\r\na great lazy reluctance,” Mr. Gladstone set his face with a family party\r\ntowards Florence. He found the weather more northern than at Hawarden, but\r\nit was healthy. He was favourably impressed by all he saw of Italian\r\nsociety (English being cultivated to a degree that surprised him), but he\r\ndid his best to observe Sir Andrew Clark’s injunction that he should\r\npractise the Trappist discipline of silence, and the condition of his\r\nvoice improved in consequence. He read Scartazzini’s book on Dante, and\r\nfound it fervid, generally judicial, and most unsparing in labour; and he\r\nwas much interested in Beugnot’s _Chute du Paganisme_. And as usual, he\r\nreturned homeward as unwillingly as he had departed. During the session he\r\nfought his Irish battle with unsparing tenacity, and the most conspicuous\r\npiece of his activity out of parliament was a pilgrimage to Birmingham\r\n(November 1888). It was a great gathering of lieutenants and leading\r\nsupporters from, every part of the country. Here is a note of mine:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    On the day of the great meeting in Bingley Hall, somebody came to\r\n    say that Mr. Gladstone wanted to know if I could supply him with a\r\n    certain passage from a speech of Lord Hartington’s. I found him in\r\n    his dressing-gown, conning his notes and as lively as youth. He\r\n    jumped up and pressed point after point on me, as if I had been a\r\n    great public meeting. I offered to go down to the public library\r\n    and hunt for the passage; he deprecated this, but off I went, and\r\n    after some search unearthed the passage, and copied it out. In the\r\n    evening I went to dine with him before the meeting. He had been\r\n    out for a short walk to the Oratory in the afternoon to call on\r\n    Cardinal Newman. He was not allowed, he told me, to see the\r\n    cardinal, but he had had a long talk with Father Neville. He found\r\n    that Newman was in the habit of reading with a reflector candle,\r\n    but had not a good one. “So I said I had a good one, and I sent it\r\n    round to him.” He was entirely disengaged in mind during dinner,\r\n    ate and drank his usual quantity, and talked at his best about all\r\n    manner of things. At the last moment he was telling us of John\r\n    Hunter’s confirmation, from his own medical observation, of\r\n    Homer’s remark about Dolon; a bad fellow, whose badness Homer\r\n    explains by the fact that he was a brother brought up among\r\n    sisters only:—\r\n\r\n    αὐτὰρ δ᾽ μοῦνος ἔην μετὰ πέντε κασιγνήτῃσιν.(242)\r\n\r\n    Oliver Cromwell, by the way, was an only surviving boy among seven\r\n    sisters, so we cannot take either poet or surgeon for gospel. Time\r\n    was up, and bore us away from Homer and Hunter. He was perfectly\r\n    silent in the carriage, as I remembered Bright had been when years\r\n    before I drove with him to the same hall. The sight of the vast\r\n    meeting was almost appalling, from fifteen to seventeen thousand\r\n    people. He spoke with great vigour and freedom; the fine passages\r\n    probably heard all over; many other passages certainly not heard,\r\n    but his gestures so strong and varied as to be almost as\r\n    interesting as the words would have been. The speech lasted an\r\n    hour and fifty minutes; and he was not at all exhausted when he\r\n    sat down. The scene at the close was absolutely indescribable and\r\n    incomparable, overwhelming like the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe took part in parliamentary business at the beginning of December. On\r\nDecember 3rd he spoke on Ireland with immense fervour and passion. He was\r\nroused violently by the chairman’s attempt to rule out strong language\r\nfrom debate, and made a vehement passage on that point. The substance of\r\nthe speech was rather thin and not new, but the delivery magnificent. The\r\nIrish minister rose to reply at 7.50, and Mr. Gladstone reluctantly made\r\nup his mind to dine in the House. A friend by his side said No, and at\r\n8.40 hurried him down the back-stairs to a hospitable board in Carlton\r\nGardens. He was nearly voiceless, until it was time for the rest of us to\r\ngo back. A speedy meal revived him, and he was soon discoursing on\r\nO’Connell and many other persons and things, with boundless force and\r\nvivacity.\r\n\r\nA few days later he was carried off to Naples. Hereto, he told Lord Acton,\r\n“we have been induced by three circumstances. First, a warm invitation\r\nfrom the Dufferins to Rome; as to which, however, there are _cons_ as well\r\nas _pros_ for a man who like me is neither Italian nor Curial in the view\r\nof present policies. Secondly, our kind friend Mr. Stuart Rendel has\r\nactually offered to be our conductor thither and back, to perform for us\r\nthe great service which you rendered us in the trip to Munich and Saint\r\nMartin. Thirdly, I have the hope that the stimulating climate of Naples,\r\ntogether with an abstention from speech greater than any I have before\r\nenjoyed, may act upon my ‘vocal cord,’ and partially at least restore it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III. The Special Commission. (1887-1890)\r\n\r\n\r\n    My Lords, it appears to me that the measure is unfortunate in its\r\n    origin, unfortunate in its scope and object, and unfortunate in\r\n    the circumstances which accompanied its passage through the other\r\n    House. It appears to me to establish a precedent most novel, and\r\n    fraught with the utmost danger.—LORD HERSCHELL.(243)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone’s ceaseless attention to the many phases of the struggle\r\nthat was now the centre of his public life, was especially engaged on what\r\nremains the most amazing of them. I wish it were possible to pass it over,\r\nor throw it into a secondary place; but it is too closely connected with\r\nthe progress of Mr. Gladstone’s Irish policy in British opinion at a\r\ncritical stage, and it is still the subject of too many perversions that\r\naffect his name. Transactions are to be found in our annals where wrong\r\nwas done by government to individuals on a greater scale, where a powerful\r\nmajority devised engines for the proscription of a weak minority with\r\ndeadlier aim, and where the omnipotence of parliament was abused for the\r\npurpose of faction with more ruthless result. But whether we look at the\r\nsqualid fraud in which the incident began, or at the tortuous\r\nparliamentary pretences by which it was worked out, or at the perversion\r\nof fundamental principles of legal administration involved in sending men\r\nto answer the gravest charges before a tribunal specially constituted at\r\nthe absolute discretion of their bitterest political opponents—at the\r\nmoment engaged in a fierce contest with them in another field—from\r\nwhatever point of view we approach, the erection of the Special Commission\r\nof 1888 stands out as one of the ugliest things done in the name and under\r\nthe forms of law in this island during the century.\r\n\r\n(M140) In the spring of 1887 the conductors of _The Times_, intending to\r\nstrengthen the hands of the government in their new and doubtful struggle,\r\npublished a series of articles, in which old charges against the Irish\r\nleader and his men were served up with fresh and fiery condiments. The\r\nallegations of crime were almost all indefinite; the method was by\r\nallusion, suggestion, innuendo, and the combination of ingeniously\r\nselected pieces, to form a crude and hideous mosaic. Partly from its\r\nextravagance, partly because it was in substance stale, the thing missed\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nOn the day on which the division was to be taken on the second reading of\r\nthe Coercion bill, a more formidable bolt was shot. On that morning (April\r\n18th, 1887), there appeared in the newspaper, with all the fascination of\r\nfacsimile, a letter alleged to be written by Mr. Parnell. It was dated\r\nnine days after the murders in the Phœnix Park, and purported to be an\r\napology, presumably to some violent confederate, for having as a matter of\r\nexpediency openly condemned the murders, though in truth the writer\r\nthought that one of the murdered men deserved his fate.(244) Special point\r\nwas given to the letter by a terrible charge, somewhat obliquely but still\r\nunmistakably made, in an article five or six weeks before, that Mr.\r\nParnell closely consorted with the leading Invincibles when he was\r\nreleased on parole in April 1882; that he probably learned from them what\r\nthey were about; and that he recognised the murders in the Phœnix Park as\r\ntheir handiwork.(245) The significance of the letter therefore was that,\r\nknowing the bloody deed to be theirs, he wrote for his own safety to\r\nqualify, recall, and make a humble apology for the condemnation which he\r\nhad thought it politic publicly to pronounce. The town was thrown into a\r\ngreat ferment. At the political clubs and in the lobbies, all was\r\ncomplacent jubilation on the one side, and consternation on the other.\r\nEven people with whom politics were a minor interest were shocked by such\r\nan exposure of the grievous depravity of man.\r\n\r\nMr. Parnell did not speak until one o’clock in the morning, immediately\r\nbefore the division on the second reading of the bill. He began amid the\r\ndeepest silence. His denial was scornful but explicit. The letter, he\r\nsaid, was an audacious fabrication. It is fair to admit that the\r\nministerialists were not without some excuse of a sort for the incredulous\r\nlaughter with which they received this repudiation. They put their trust\r\nin the most serious, the most powerful, the most responsible, newspaper in\r\nthe world; greatest in resources, in authority, in universal renown.\r\nNeglect of any possible precaution against fraud and forgery in a document\r\nto be used for the purpose of blasting a great political opponent would be\r\nculpable in no common degree. Of this neglect people can hardly be blamed\r\nfor thinking that the men of business, men of the world, and men of honour\r\nwho were masters of the _Times_, must be held absolutely incapable.\r\n\r\nThose who took this view were encouraged in it by the prime minister.\r\nWithin four-and-twenty hours he publicly took the truth of the story, with\r\nall its worst innuendoes, entirely for granted. He went with rapid stride\r\nfrom possibility to probability, and from probability to certainty. In a\r\nspeech, of which precipitate credulity was not the only fault, Lord\r\nSalisbury let fall the sentence: “When men who knew gentlemen who\r\nintimately knew Mr. Parnell murdered Mr. Burke.” He denounced Mr.\r\nGladstone for making a trusted friend of such a man—one who had “mixed on\r\nterms of intimacy with those whose advocacy of assassination was well\r\nknown.” Then he went further. “You may go back,” he said, “to the\r\nbeginning of British government, you may go back from decade to decade,\r\nand from leader to leader, but you will never find a man who has accepted\r\na position, in reference to an ally tainted with the strong presumption of\r\nconniving at assassination, which has been accepted by Mr. Gladstone at\r\nthe present time.”(246) Seldom has party spirit led eminent personages to\r\ngreater lengths of dishonouring absurdity.\r\n\r\nNow and afterwards people asked why Mr. Parnell did not promptly bring his\r\nlibellers before a court of law. The answer was simple. The case would\r\nnaturally have been tried in London. In other words, not only the\r\nplaintiff’s own character, but the whole movement that he represented,\r\nwould have been submitted to a Middlesex jury, with all the national and\r\npolitical prejudices inevitable in such a body, and with all the twelve\r\nchances of a disagreement, that would be almost as disastrous to Mr.\r\nParnell as an actual verdict for his assailants. The issues were too great\r\nto be exposed to the hazards of a cast of the die. Then, why not lay the\r\nvenue in Ireland? It was true that a favourable verdict might just as\r\nreasonably be expected from the prepossessions of Dublin, as an\r\nunfavourable one from the prepossessions of London. But the moral effect\r\nof an Irish verdict upon English opinion would be exactly as worthless, as\r\nthe effect of an English verdict in a political or international case\r\nwould be upon the judgment and feeling of Ireland. To procure a\r\ncondemnation of the _Times_ at the Four Courts, as a means of affecting\r\nEnglish opinion, would not be worth a single guinea. Undoubtedly the\r\nsubsequent course of this strange history fully justified the advice that\r\nMr. Parnell received in this matter from the three persons in the House of\r\nCommons with whom on this point he took counsel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prudent decision against bringing a fierce political controversy\r\nbefore an English judge and jury was in a few months brought to nought,\r\nfrom motives that have remained obscure, and with results that nobody\r\ncould foresee. The next act in the drama was the institution of\r\nproceedings for libel against the _Times_ in November 1887, by an Irishman\r\nwho had formerly sat in parliament as a political follower of Mr. Parnell.\r\nThe newspaper met him by denying that the articles on _Parnellism and\r\nCrime_ related to him. It went on to plead that the statements in the\r\narticles were true in substance and in fact. The action was tried before\r\nLord Coleridge in July 1888, and the newspaper was represented by the\r\nadvocate who happened to be the principal law officer of the crown. The\r\nplaintiff’s counsel picked out certain passages, said that his client was\r\none of the persons intended to be libelled, and claimed damages. He was\r\nheld to have made an undoubted _prima facie_ case on the two libels in\r\nwhich he had been specifically named. This gave the enemy his chance. The\r\nattorney general, speaking for three days, opened the whole case for the\r\nnewspaper; repeated and enlarged upon the charges and allegations in its\r\narticles; stated the facts which he proposed to give in evidence; sought\r\nto establish that the fac-simile letter was really signed by Mr. Parnell;\r\nand finally put forward other letters, now produced for the first time,\r\nwhich carried complicity and connivance to a further point. These charges\r\nhe said that he should prove. On the third day he entirely changed his\r\ntack. Having launched this mass of criminating imputation, he then\r\nsuddenly bethought him, so he said, of the hardships which his course\r\nwould entail upon the Irishmen, and asked that in that action he should\r\nnot be called upon to prove anything at all. The Irishmen and their leader\r\nremained under a load of odium that the law officer of the crown had cast\r\nupon them, and declined to substantiate.\r\n\r\nThe production of this further batch of letters stirred Mr. Parnell from\r\nhis usual impassiveness. His former determination to sit still was shaken.\r\nThe day after the attorney general’s speech, he came to the present writer\r\nto say that he thought of sending a paragraph to the newspapers that\r\nnight, with an announcement of his intention to bring an action against\r\nthe _Times_, narrowed to the issue of the letters. The old arguments\r\nagainst an action were again pressed upon him. He insisted, on the other\r\nside, that he was not afraid of cross-examination; that they might\r\ncross-examine as much as ever they pleased, either about the doings of the\r\nland league or the letters; that his hands would be found to be clean, and\r\nthe letters to be gross (M141) forgeries. The question between us was\r\nadjourned; and meanwhile he fell in with my suggestion that he should the\r\nnext day make a personal statement to the House. The personal statement\r\nwas made in his most frigid manner, and it was as frigidly received. He\r\nwent through the whole of the letters, one by one; showed the palpable\r\nincredibility of some of them upon their very face, and in respect of\r\nthose which purported to be written by himself, he declared, in words free\r\nfrom all trace of evasion, that he had never written them, never signed\r\nthem, never directed nor authorised them to be written.\r\n\r\nSo the matter was left on the evening of Friday (July 6, 1888). On Monday\r\nMr. Parnell came to the House with the intention to ask for a select\r\ncommittee. The feeling of the English friend to whom he announced his\r\nintention in the lobby, still was that the matter might much better be\r\nleft where it stood. The new batch of letters had strengthened his\r\nposition, for the Kilmainham letter was a fraud upon the face of it, and a\r\nstory that he had given a hundred pounds to a fugitive from justice after\r\nthe murders, had been demolished. The press throughout the country had\r\ntreated the subject very coolly. The government would pretty certainly\r\nrefuse a select committee, and what would be the advantage to him in the\r\nminds of persons inclined to think him guilty, of making a demand which he\r\nknew beforehand would be declined? Such was the view now pressed upon Mr.\r\nParnell. This time he was not moved. He took his own course, as he had a\r\nparamount right to do. He went into the House and asked the ministers to\r\ngrant a select committee to inquire into the authenticity of the letters\r\nread at the recent trial. Mr. Smith replied, as before, that the House was\r\nabsolutely incompetent to deal with the charges. Mr. Parnell then gave\r\nnotice that he would that night put on the paper the motion for a\r\ncommittee, and on Thursday demand a day for its discussion.\r\n\r\nWhen Thursday arrived, either because the hot passion of the majority was\r\nirresistible, or from a cool calculation of policy, or simply because the\r\nsituation was becoming intolerable, a new decision had been taken, itself\r\nfar more intolerable than the scandal that it was to dissipate. The\r\ngovernment met the Irish leader with a refusal and an offer. They would\r\nnot give a committee, but they were willing to propose a commission to\r\nconsist wholly or mainly of judges, with statutory power to inquire into\r\n“the allegations and charges made against members of parliament by the\r\ndefendants in the recent action.” If the gentlemen from Ireland were\r\nprepared to accept the offer, the government would at once put on the\r\npaper for the following Monday, notice of motion for leave to bring in a\r\nbill.(247)\r\n\r\nWhen the words of the notice of motion appeared in print, it was found\r\namid universal astonishment that the special commission was to inquire\r\ninto the charges and allegations generally, not only against certain\r\nmembers of parliament, but also against “other persons.” The enormity of\r\nthis sudden extension of the operation was palpable. A certain member is\r\ncharged with the authorship of incriminating letters. To clear his\r\ncharacter as a member of parliament, he demands a select committee. We\r\ndecline to give a committee, says the minister, but we offer you a\r\ncommission of judges, and you may take our offer or refuse, as you please;\r\nonly the judges must inquire not merely into your question of the letters,\r\nbut into all the charges and allegations made against all of you, and not\r\nthese only, but into the charges and allegations made against other people\r\nas well. This was extraordinary enough, but it was not all.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to feel much surprise that Mr. Parnell was ready to\r\nassent to any course, however unconstitutional that course might be, if\r\nonly it led to the exposure of an insufferable wrong. The credit of\r\nparliament and the sanctity of constitutional right were no supreme\r\nconcern of his. He was burning to get at any expedient, committee or\r\ncommission, which should enable him to unmask and smite his hidden foes.\r\nMuch of his private language at this time was in some respects vague and\r\nineffectual, but he was naturally averse to any course that might, in his\r\nown words, look like backing down. “Of course,” he said, “I am not sure\r\nthat we shall come off with flying colours. But I think we shall. I am\r\nnever sure of anything.” He was still confident that he had the clue.\r\n\r\nOn the second stage of the transaction, Mr. Smith, in answer to various\r\nquestions in the early part of the sitting, made a singular declaration.\r\nThe bill, he said, of which he had given notice, was a bill to be\r\nintroduced in accordance with the offer already made. “I do not desire to\r\ndebate the proposal; and I have put it in this position on the Order Book,\r\nin order that it may be rejected or accepted by the honourable member in\r\nthe form in which it stands.” Then in the next sentence, he said, “If the\r\nmotion is received and accepted by the House, the bill will be printed and\r\ncirculated, and I will then name a day for the second reading. But I may\r\nsay frankly that I do not anticipate being able to make provision for a\r\ndebate on the second reading of a measure of this kind. It was an offer\r\nmade by the government to the honourable gentleman and his friends, to be\r\neither accepted or rejected.”(248) The minister treated his bill as\r\nlightly as if it were some small proposal of ordinary form and of even\r\nless than ordinary importance. It is not inconceivable that there was\r\ndesign in this, for Mr. Smith concealed under a surface of plain and\r\nhomely worth a very full share of parliamentary craft, and he knew well\r\nenough that the more extraordinary the measure, the more politic it always\r\nis to open with an air of humdrum.\r\n\r\nThe bill came on at midnight July 16, in a House stirred with intense\r\nexcitement, closely suppressed. The leader of the House made the motion\r\nfor leave to introduce the most curious innovation of the century, in a\r\nspeech of half-a-minute. It might have been a formal bill for a\r\nprovisional order, to be taken as of course. Mr. Parnell, his ordinary\r\npallor made deeper by anger, and with unusual though very natural\r\nvehemence of demeanour, at once hit the absurdity of asking him whether he\r\naccepted or rejected the bill, not only before it was printed but without\r\nexplanation of its contents. He then pressed in two or three weighty\r\nsentences the deeper absurdity of leaving him any option at all. The\r\nattorney general had said of the story of the fac-simile letter, that if\r\nit was not genuine, it was the worst libel ever launched on a public man.\r\nIf the first lord believed his attorney, said Mr. Parnell, instead of\r\ntalking about making a bargain with me, he ought to have come down and\r\nsaid, “The government are determined to have this investigation, whether\r\nthe honourable member, this alleged criminal, likes it or not.”(249)\r\n\r\nThat was in fact precisely what the government had determined. The\r\nprofession that the bill was a benevolent device for enabling the alleged\r\ncriminals to extricate themselves was very soon dropped. The offer of a\r\nboon to be accepted or declined at discretion was transformed into a grand\r\ncompulsory investigation into the connection of the national and land\r\nleagues with agrarian crime, and the members of parliament were virtually\r\nput into the dock along with all sorts of other persons who chanced to be\r\nmembers of those associations. The effect was certain. Any facts showing\r\ncriminality in this or that member of the league would be taken to show\r\ncriminality in the organisation as a whole, and especially in the\r\npolitical leaders. And the proceeding could only be vindicated by the\r\ntruly outrageous principle that where a counsel in a suit finds it his\r\nduty as advocate to make grave charges against members of parliament in\r\ncourt, then it becomes an obligation on the government to ask for an Act\r\nto appoint a judicial commission to examine those charges, if only they\r\nare grave enough.\r\n\r\nThe best chance of frustrating the device was lost when the bill was\r\nallowed to pass its first reading unopposed. Three of the leaders of the\r\nliberal opposition—two in the Commons, one in the Lords—were for making a\r\nbold stand against the bill from the first. Mr. Gladstone, on the\r\ncontrary, with his lively instinct for popular feeling out of doors,\r\ndisliked any action indicative of reluctance to face inquiry; and though\r\nholding a strong view that no case had been made out for putting aside the\r\nconstitutional and convenient organ of a committee, yet he thought that an\r\n(M142) inquiry under thoroughly competent and impartial judges, after the\r\nright and true method of proceeding had been refused, was still better\r\nthan no proceeding at all. This much of assent, however, was qualified. “I\r\nthink,” he said, “that an inquiry under thoroughly competent and impartial\r\njudges is better than none. But that inquiry must, I think, be put into\r\nsuch a shape as shall correspond with the general law and principles of\r\njustice.” As he believed, the first and most indispensable conditions of\r\nan effective inquiry were wanting, and without them he “certainly would\r\nhave no responsibility whatever.”(250)\r\n\r\nFor the first few days politicians were much adrift. They had moments of\r\ncompunction. Whether friends or foes of the Irish, they were perplexed by\r\nthe curious double aspect of the measure. Mr. Parnell himself began to\r\nfeel misgivings, as he came to realise the magnitude of the inquiry, its\r\nvast expense, its interminable length, its unfathomable uncertainties. On\r\nthe day appointed for the second reading of the bill appointing the\r\ncommission (July 23), some other subject kept the business back until\r\nseven o’clock. Towards six, Mr. Parnell who was to open the debate on his\r\nown side, came to an English friend, to ask whether there would be time\r\nfor him to go away for an hour; he wished to examine some new furnace for\r\nassaying purposes, the existence of gold in Wicklow being one of his fixed\r\nideas. So steady was the composure of this extraordinary man. The English\r\nfriend grimly remarked to him that it would perhaps be rather safer not to\r\nlose sight of the furnace in which at any moment his own assaying might\r\nbegin. His speech on this critical occasion was not one of his best.\r\nIndifference to his audience often made him meagre, though he was scarcely\r\never other than clear, and in this debate there was only one effective\r\npoint which it was necessary for him to press. The real issue was whether\r\nthe reference to the judges should be limited or unlimited; should be a\r\nfishing inquiry at large into the history of an agrarian agitation ten\r\nyears old, or an examination into definite and specified charges against\r\nnamed members of parliament. The minister, in moving the second reading,\r\nno longer left it to the Irish members to accept or reject; it now rested,\r\nhe said, with the House to decide. It became evident that the acuter\r\nmembers of the majority, fully awakened to the opportunities for\r\ndestroying the Irishmen which an unlimited inquisition might furnish, had\r\nmade up their minds that no limit should be set to the scope of the\r\ninquisition. Boldly they tramped through a thick jungle of fallacy and\r\ninconsistency. They had never ceased to insist, and they insisted now,\r\nthat Mr. Parnell ought to have gone into a court of law. Yet they fought\r\nas hard as they could against every proposal for making the procedure of\r\nthe commission like the procedure of a law court. In a court there would\r\nhave been a specific indictment. Here a specific indictment was what they\r\nmost positively refused, and for it they substituted a roving inquiry,\r\nwhich is exactly what a court never undertakes. They first argued that\r\nnothing but a commission was available to test the charges against members\r\nof parliament. Then, when they had bethought themselves of further\r\nobjects, they argued round that it was unheard of and inconceivable to\r\ninstitute a royal commission for members of parliament alone.\r\n\r\nAll arguments, however unanswerable, were at this stage idle, because Mr.\r\nParnell had reverted to his original resolution to accept the bill, and at\r\nhis request the radicals sitting below him abandoned their opposition. The\r\nbill passed the second reading without a division. This circumstance\r\npermitted the convenient assertion, made so freely afterwards, that the\r\nbill, irregular, unconstitutional, violent, as it might be, at any rate\r\nreceived the unanimous assent of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nStormy scenes marked the progress of the bill through committee. Seeing\r\nthe exasperation produced by their shifting of the ground, and the delay\r\nwhich it would naturally entail, ministers resolved on a bold step. It was\r\nnow August. Government remembered the process by which they had carried\r\nthe Coercion bill, and they improved upon it. After three days of\r\ncommittee, they moved that at one o’clock in the morning on the fourth\r\nsitting the (M143) chairman should break off discussion, put forthwith the\r\nquestion already proposed from the chair, then successively put forthwith\r\nall the remaining clauses, and so report the bill to the House. This\r\nprocess shut out all amendments not reached at the fatal hour, and is the\r\nmost drastic and sweeping of all forms of closure. In the case of the\r\nCoercion bill, resort to the guillotine was declared to be warranted by\r\nthe urgency of social order in Ireland. That plea was at least plausible.\r\nNo such plea of urgency could be invoked for a measure, which only a few\r\ndays before the government had considered to be of such secondary\r\nimportance, that the simple rejection of it by Mr. Parnell was to be\r\nenough to induce them to withdraw it. The bill that had been proffered as\r\na generous concession to Irish members, was now violently forced upon them\r\nwithout debate. Well might Mr. Gladstone speak of the most extraordinary\r\nseries of proceedings that he had ever known.(251)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three judges first met on September 17, 1888, to settle their\r\nprocedure. They sat for one hundred and twenty-eight days, and rose for\r\nthe last time on November 22, 1889. More than four hundred and fifty\r\nwitnesses were examined. One counsel spoke for five days, another for\r\nseven, and a third for nearly twelve. The mammoth record of the\r\nproceedings fills eleven folio volumes, making between seven and eight\r\nthousand pages. The questions put to witnesses numbered ninety-eight\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange and fantastic scene. Three judges were trying a social\r\nand political revolution. The leading actors in it were virtually in the\r\ndock. The tribunal had been specially set up by their political opponents,\r\nwithout giving them any effective voice either in its composition or upon\r\nthe character and scope of its powers. For the first time in England since\r\nthe Great Rebellion, men were practically put upon their trial on a\r\npolitical charge, without giving them the protection of a jury. For the\r\nfirst time in that period judges were to find a verdict upon the facts of\r\ncrime. The charge placed in the forefront was a charge of conspiracy. But\r\nto call a combination a conspiracy does not make it a conspiracy or a\r\nguilty combination, unless the verdict of a jury pronounces it to be one.\r\nA jury would have taken all the large attendant circumstances into\r\naccount. The three judges felt themselves bound expressly to shut out\r\nthose circumstances. In words of vital importance, they said, “We must\r\nleave it for politicians to discuss, and for statesmen to determine, in\r\nwhat respects the present laws affecting land in Ireland are capable of\r\nimprovement. _We have no commission to consider whether the conduct of\r\nwhich they are accused can be palliated by the circumstances of the time,\r\nor whether it should be condoned in consideration of benefits alleged to\r\nhave resulted from their action._”(252) When the proceedings were over,\r\nLord Salisbury applauded the report as “giving a very complete view of a\r\nvery curious episode of our internal history.”(253) A very complete view\r\nof an agrarian rising—though it left out all palliating circumstances and\r\nthe whole state of agrarian law!\r\n\r\nInstead of opening with the letters, as the country expected, the accusers\r\nbegan by rearing a prodigious accumulation of material, first for the\r\nIrish or agrarian branch of their case, and then for the American branch.\r\nThe government helped them to find their witnesses, and so varied a host\r\nwas never seen in London before. There was the peasant from Kerry in his\r\nfrieze swallow-tail and knee-breeches, and the woman in her scarlet\r\npetticoat who runs barefoot over the bog in Galway. The convicted member\r\nof a murder club was brought up in custody from Mountjoy prison or\r\nMaryborough. One of the most popular of the Irish representatives had been\r\nfetched from his dungeon, and was to be seen wandering through the lobbies\r\nin search of his warders. Men who had been shot by moonlighters limped\r\ninto the box, and poor women in their blue-hooded cloaks told pitiful\r\ntales of midnight horror. The sharp spy was there, who disclosed sinister\r\nsecrets from cities across the Atlantic, and the uncouth informer who\r\nbetrayed or invented the history of rude and ferocious plots hatched at\r\nthe country cross-roads (M144) or over the peat fire in desolate cabins in\r\nwestern Ireland. Divisional commissioners with their ledgers of agrarian\r\noffences, agents with bags full of figures and documents, landlords,\r\npriests, prelates, magistrates, detectives, smart members of that famous\r\nconstabulary force which is the arm, eye, and ear of the Irish\r\ngovernment—all the characters of the Irish melodrama were crowded into the\r\ncorridors, and in their turn brought out upon the stage of this surprising\r\ntheatre.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings speedily settled down into the most wearisome drone that\r\nwas ever heard in a court of law. The object of the accusers was to show\r\nthe complicity of the accused with crime by tracing crime to the league,\r\nand making every member of the league constructively liable for every act\r\nof which the league was constructively guilty. Witnesses were produced in\r\na series that seemed interminable, to tell the story of five-and-twenty\r\noutrages in Mayo, of as many in Cork, of forty-two in Galway, of\r\nsixty-five in Kerry, one after another, and all with immeasurable detail.\r\nSome of the witnesses spoke no English, and the English of others was\r\nhardly more intelligible than Erse. Long extracts were read out from four\r\nhundred and forty speeches. The counsel on one side produced a passage\r\nthat made against the speaker, and then the counsel on the other side\r\nfound and read some qualifying passage that made as strongly for him. The\r\nthree judges groaned. They had already, they said plaintively, ploughed\r\nthrough the speeches in the solitude of their own rooms. Could they not be\r\ntaken as read? No, said the prosecuting counsel; we are building up an\r\nargument, and it cannot be built up in a silent manner. In truth it was\r\ndesigned for the public outside the court,(254) and not a touch could be\r\nspared that might deepen the odium. Week after week the ugly tale went\r\non—a squalid ogre let loose among a population demoralised by ages of\r\nwicked neglect, misery, and oppression. One side strove to show that the\r\nogre had been wantonly raised by the land league for political objects of\r\ntheir own; the other, that it was the progeny of distress and wrong, that\r\nthe league had rather controlled than kindled its ferocity, and that crime\r\nand outrage were due to local animosities for which neither league nor\r\nparliamentary leaders were answerable.\r\n\r\nOn the forty-fourth day (February 5) came a lurid glimpse from across the\r\nAtlantic. The Irish emigration had carried with it to America the deadly\r\npassion for the secret society. A spy was produced, not an Irishman this\r\ntime for a wonder, but an Englishman. He had been for eight-and-twenty\r\nyears in the United States, and for more than twenty of them he had been\r\nin the pay of Scotland Yard, a military spy, as he put it, in the service\r\nof his country. There is no charge against him that he belonged to that\r\nfoul species who provoke others to crime and then for a bribe betray them.\r\nHe swore an oath of secrecy to his confederates in the camps of the\r\nClan-na-Gael, and then he broke his oath by nearly every post that went\r\nfrom New York to London. It is not a nice trade, but then the dynamiter’s\r\nis not a nice trade either.(255) The man had risen high in the secret\r\nbrotherhood. Such an existence demanded nerves of steel; a moment of\r\nforgetfulness, an accident with a letter, the slip of a phrase in the two\r\nparts that he was playing, would have doomed him in the twinkling of an\r\neye. He now stood a rigorous cross-examination like iron. There is no\r\nreason to think that he told lies. He was perhaps a good deal less trusted\r\nthan he thought, for he does not appear on any occasion to have forewarned\r\nthe police at home of any of the dynamite attempts that four or five years\r\nearlier had startled the English capital. The pith of his week’s evidence\r\nwas his account of an interview between himself and Mr. Parnell in the\r\ncorridors of the House of Commons in April 1881. In this interview, Mr.\r\nParnell, he said, expressed his desire to bring the Fenians in Ireland\r\ninto line with his own constitutional movement, and to that end requested\r\nthe spy to invite a notorious leader of the physical force party in\r\nAmerica to come over to Ireland, to arrange a harmonious understanding.\r\nMr. Parnell had no recollection of the interview, (M145) though he thought\r\nit very possible that an interview might have taken place. It was\r\nundoubtedly odd that the spy having once got his line over so big a fish,\r\nshould never afterwards have made any attempt to draw him on. The judges,\r\nhowever, found upon a review of “the probabilities of the case,” that the\r\nconversation in the corridor really took place, that the spy’s account was\r\ncorrect, and that it was not impossible that in conversation with a\r\nsupposed revolutionist, Mr. Parnell may have used such language as to\r\nleave the impression that he agreed with his interlocutor. Perhaps a more\r\nexact way of putting it would be that the spy talked the Fenian doctrine\r\nof physical force, and that Mr. Parnell listened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last, on the fiftieth day (February 14, 1889), and not before, the\r\ncourt reached the business that had led to its own creation. Three batches\r\nof letters had been produced by the newspaper. The manager of the\r\nnewspaper told his story, and then the immediate purveyor of the letters\r\ntold his. Marvellous stories they were.\r\n\r\nThe manager was convinced from the beginning, as he ingenuously said,\r\nquite independently of handwriting, that the letters were genuine. Why? he\r\nwas asked. Because he felt they were the sort of letters that Mr. Parnell\r\nwould be likely to write. He counted, not wholly without some reason, on\r\nthe public sharing this inspiration of his own indwelling light. The day\r\nwas approaching for the division on the Coercion bill. Every journalist,\r\nsaid the manager, must choose his moment. He now thought the moment\r\nsuitable for making the public acquainted with the character of the\r\nIrishmen. So, with no better evidence of authority than his firm faith\r\nthat it was the sort of letter that Mr. Parnell would be likely to write,\r\non the morning of the second reading of the Coercion bill, he launched the\r\nfac-simile letter. In the early part of 1888 he received from the same\r\nhand a second batch of letters, and a third batch a few days later. His\r\ntotal payments amounted to over two thousand five hundred pounds. He still\r\nasked no questions as to the source of these expensive documents. On the\r\ncontrary he particularly avoided the subject. So much for the cautious and\r\nexperienced man of business.\r\n\r\nThe natural course would have been now to carry the inquiry on to the\r\nsource of the letters. Instead of that, the prosecutors called an expert\r\nin handwriting. The court expostulated. Why should they not hear at once\r\nwhere the letters came from; and then it might be proper enough to hear\r\nwhat an expert had to say? After a final struggle the prolonged tactics of\r\ndeferring the evil day, and prejudicing the case up to the eleventh hour,\r\nwere at last put to shame. The second of the two marvellous stories was\r\nnow to be told.\r\n\r\nThe personage who had handed the three batches of letters to the\r\nnewspaper, told the Court how he had in 1885 compiled a pamphlet called\r\n_Parnellism Unmasked_, partly from materials communicated to him by a\r\ncertain broken-down Irish journalist. To this unfortunate sinner, then in\r\na state of penury little short of destitution, he betook himself one\r\nwinter night in Dublin at the end of 1885. Long after, when the game was\r\nup and the whole sordid tragi-comedy laid bare, the poor wretch wrote: “I\r\nhave been in difficulties and great distress for want of money for the\r\nlast twenty years, and in order to find means of support for myself and my\r\nlarge family, I have been guilty of many acts which must for ever disgrace\r\nme.”(256) He had now within reach a guinea a day, and much besides, if he\r\nwould endeavour to find any documents that might be available to sustain\r\nthe charges made in the pamphlet. After some hesitation the bargain was\r\nstruck, a guinea a day, hotel and travelling expenses, and a round price\r\nfor documents. Within a few months the needy man in clover pocketed many\r\nhundreds of pounds. Only the author of the history of _Jonathan Wild the\r\nGreat_ could do justice to such a story of the Vagabond in Luck—a jaunt to\r\nLausanne, a trip across the Atlantic, incessant journeys backward and\r\nforward to Paris, the jingling of guineas, the rustle of hundred-pound\r\nnotes, and now and then perhaps a humorous thought of simple and solemn\r\npeople in newspaper offices in London, or a moment’s meditation on that\r\nperplexing law of human affairs by which the weak things (M146) of the\r\nworld are chosen to confound the things that are mighty.\r\n\r\nThe moment came for delivering the documents in Paris, and delivered they\r\nwere with details more grotesque than anything since the foolish baronet\r\nin Scott’s novel was taken by Dousterswivel to find the buried treasure in\r\nSaint Ruth’s. From first to last not a test or check was applied by\r\nanybody to hinder the fabrication from running its course without a hitch\r\nor a crease. When men have the demon of a fixed idea in their cerebral\r\nconvolutions, they easily fall victims to a devastating credulity, and the\r\nvictims were now radiant as, with microscope and calligraphic expert by\r\ntheir side, they fondly gazed upon their prize. About the time when the\r\njudges were getting to work, clouds arose on this smiling horizon. It is\r\ngood, says the old Greek, that men should carry a threatening shadow in\r\ntheir hearts even under the full sunshine. Before this, the manager\r\nlearned for the first time, what was the source of the letters. The\r\nblessed doctrine of intrinsic certainty, however, which has before now\r\ndone duty in far graver controversy, prevented him from inquiring as to\r\nthe purity of the source.\r\n\r\nThe toils were rapidly enclosing both the impostor and the dupes. He was\r\nput into the box at last (Feb. 21). By the end of the second day, the\r\ntorture had become more than he could endure. Some miscalled the scene\r\ndramatic. That is hardly the right name for the merciless hunt of an\r\nabject fellow-creature through the doublings and windings of a thousand\r\nlies. The breath of the hounds was on him, and he could bear the chase no\r\nlonger. After proceedings not worth narrating, except that he made a\r\nconfession and then committed his last perjury, he disappeared. The police\r\ntraced him to Madrid. When they entered his room with their warrant (March\r\n1), he shot himself dead. They found on his corpse the scapulary worn by\r\ndevout catholics as a visible badge and token of allegiance to the\r\nheavenly powers. So in the ghastliest wreck of life, men still hope and\r\nseek for some mysterious cleansing of the soul that shall repair all.\r\n\r\nThis damning experience was a sharp mortification to the government, who\r\nhad been throughout energetic confederates in the attack. Though it did\r\nnot come at once formally into debate, it exhilarated the opposition, and\r\nMr. Gladstone himself was in great spirits, mingled with intense\r\nindignation and genuine sympathy for Mr. Parnell as a man who had suffered\r\nan odious wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe report of the commission was made to the crown on February 13, 1890.\r\nIt reached the House of Commons about ten o’clock the same evening. The\r\nscene was curious,—the various speakers droning away in a House otherwise\r\nprofoundly silent, and every member on every bench, including high\r\nministers of state, plunged deep and eager into the blue-book. The general\r\nimpression was that the findings amounted to acquittal, and everybody went\r\nhome in considerable excitement at this final explosion of the damaged\r\nblunderbuss. The next day Mr. Gladstone had a meeting with the lawyers in\r\nthe case, and was keen for action in one form or another; but on the whole\r\nit was agreed that the government should be left to take the initiative.\r\n\r\nThe report was discussed in both Houses, and strong speeches were made on\r\nboth sides. The government (Mar. 3) proposed a motion that the House\r\nadopted the report, thanked the judges for their just and impartial\r\nconduct, and ordered the report to be entered on the journals. Mr.\r\nGladstone followed with an amendment, that the House deemed it to be a\r\nduty to record its reprobation of the false charges of the gravest and\r\nmost odious description, based on calumny and on forgery, that had been\r\nbrought against members of the House; and, while declaring its\r\nsatisfaction at the exposure of these calumnies, the House expressed its\r\nregret at the wrong inflicted and the suffering and loss endured through a\r\nprotracted period by reason of these acts of flagrant iniquity. After a\r\nhandsome tribute to the honour and good faith of the judges, he took the\r\npoint that some of the opinions in the report were in no sense and no\r\ndegree judicial. How, for instance, could three judges, sitting ten years\r\nafter the fact (1879-80), determine better than anybody (M147) else that\r\ndistress and extravagant rents had nothing to do with crime? Why should\r\nthe House of Commons declare its adoption of this finding without question\r\nor correction? Or of this, that the rejection of the Disturbance bill by\r\nthe Lords in 1880 had nothing to do with the increase of crime? Mr.\r\nForster had denounced the action of the Lords with indignation, and was\r\nnot he, the responsible minister, a better witness than the three judges\r\nin no contact with contemporary fact? How were the judges authorised to\r\naffirm that the Land bill of 1881 had not been a great cause in mitigating\r\nthe condition of Ireland? Another conclusive objection was that—on the\r\ndeclaration of the judges themselves, rightly made by them—what we know to\r\nbe essential portions of the evidence were entirely excluded from their\r\nview.\r\n\r\nHe next turned to the findings, first of censure, then of acquittal. The\r\nfindings of censure were in substance three. First, seven of the\r\nrespondents had joined the league with a view of separating Ireland from\r\nEngland. The idea was dead, but Mr. Gladstone was compelled to say that in\r\nhis opinion to deny the moral authority of the Act of Union was for an\r\nIrishman no moral offence whatever. Here the law-officer sitting opposite\r\nto him busily took down a note. “Yes, yes,” Mr. Gladstone exclaimed, “you\r\nmay take my words down. I heard you examine your witness from a pedestal,\r\nas you felt, of the greatest elevation, endeavouring to press home the\r\nmonstrous guilt of an Irishman who did not allow moral authority to the\r\nAct of Union. In my opinion the Englishman has far more cause to blush for\r\nthe means by which that Act was obtained.” As it happened, on the only\r\noccasion on which Mr. Gladstone paid the Commission a visit, he had found\r\nthe attorney general cross-examining a leading Irish member, and this\r\npassage of arms on the Act of Union between counsel and witness then\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nThe second finding of censure was that the Irish members incited to\r\nintimidation by speeches, knowing that intimidation led to crime. The\r\nthird was that they never placed themselves on the side of law and order;\r\nthey did not assist the administration, and did not denounce the party of\r\nphysical force. As if this, said Mr. Gladstone, had not been the subject\r\nof incessant discussion and denunciation in parliament at the time ten\r\nyears ago, and yet no vote of condemnation was passed upon the Irish\r\nmembers then. On the contrary, the tory party, knowing all these charges,\r\nassociated with them for purposes of votes and divisions; climbed into\r\noffice on Mr. Parnell’s shoulders; and through the viceroy with the\r\nconcurrence of the prime minister, took Mr. Parnell into counsel upon the\r\ndevising of a plan for Irish government. Was parliament now to affirm and\r\nrecord a finding that it had scrupulously abstained from ever making its\r\nown, and without regard to the counter-allegation that more crime and\r\nworse crime was prevented by agitation? It was the duty of parliament to\r\nlook at the whole of the facts of the great crisis of 1880-1—to the\r\ndistress, to the rejection of the Compensation bill, to the growth of\r\nevictions, to the prevalence of excessive rents. The judges expressly shut\r\nout this comprehensive survey. But the House was not a body with a limited\r\ncommission; it was a body of statesmen, legislators, politicians, bound to\r\nlook at the whole range of circumstances, and guilty of misprision of\r\njustice if they failed so to do. “Suppose I am told,” he said in notable\r\nand mournful words, “that without the agitation Ireland would never have\r\nhad the Land Act of 1881, are you prepared to deny that? I hear no\r\nchallenges upon that statement, for I think it is generally and deeply\r\nfelt that without the agitation the Land Act would not have been passed.\r\nAs the man responsible more than any other for the Act of 1881—as the man\r\nwhose duty it was to consider that question day and night during nearly\r\nthe whole of that session—I must record my firm opinion that it would not\r\nhave become the law of the land, if it had not been for the agitation with\r\nwhich Irish society was convulsed.”(257)\r\n\r\nThis bare table of his leading points does nothing to convey the\r\nimpression made by an extraordinarily fine performance. When the speaker\r\ncame to the findings of acquittal, to the dismissal of the infamous\r\ncharges of the forged letters, of intimacy with the Invincibles, of being\r\n(M148) accessory to the assassinations in the Park, glowing passion in\r\nvoice and gesture reached its most powerful pitch, and the moral appeal at\r\nits close was long remembered among the most searching words that he had\r\never spoken. It was not forensic argument, it was not literature; it had\r\nevery note of true oratory—a fervid, direct and pressing call to his\r\nhearers as “individuals, man by man, not with a responsibility diffused\r\nand severed until it became inoperative and worthless, to place himself in\r\nthe position of the victim of this frightful outrage; to give such a\r\njudgment as would bear the scrutiny of the heart and of the conscience of\r\nevery man when he betook himself to his chamber and was still.”\r\n\r\nThe awe that impressed the House from this exhortation to repair an\r\nenormous wrong soon passed away, and debate in both Houses went on the\r\nregular lines of party. Everything that was found not to be proved against\r\nthe Irishmen, was assumed against them. Not proven was treated as only an\r\nevasive form of guilty. Though the three judges found that there was no\r\nevidence that the accused had done this thing or that, yet it was held\r\nlegitimate to argue that evidence must exist—if only it could be found.\r\nThe public were to nurse a sort of twilight conviction and keep their\r\nminds in a limbo of beliefs that were substantial and alive—only the light\r\nwas bad.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the public did what the judges declined to do. They took\r\ncircumstances into account. The general effect of this transaction was to\r\npromote the progress of the great unsettled controversy in Mr. Gladstone’s\r\nsense. The abstract merits of home rule were no doubt untouched, but it\r\nmade a difference to the concrete argument, whether the future leader of\r\nan Irish parliament was a proved accomplice of the Park murderers or not.\r\nIt presented moreover the chameleon Irish case in a new and singular\r\ncolour. A squalid insurrection awoke parliament to the mischiefs and\r\nwrongs of the Irish cultivators. Reluctantly it provided a remedy. Then in\r\nthe fulness of time, ten years after, it dealt with the men who had roused\r\nit to its duty. And how? It brought them to trial before a special\r\ntribunal, invented for the purpose, and with no jury; it allowed them no\r\nvoice in the constitution of the tribunal; it exposed them to long and\r\nharassing proceedings; and it thereby levied upon them a tremendous\r\npecuniary fine. The report produced a strong recoil against the flagrant\r\nviolence, passion, and calumny, that had given it birth; and it affected\r\nthat margin of men, on the edge of either of the two great parties by whom\r\nelectoral decisions are finally settled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV. An Interim. (1889-1891)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The nobler a soul is, the more objects of compassion it hath.\r\n\r\n    —BACON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1888 Mr. Gladstone with his wife and others of his house was\r\ncarried off by Mr. Rendel’s friendly care to Naples. Hereto, he told Lord\r\nActon, “we have been induced by three circumstances. First, a warm\r\ninvitation from the Dufferins to Rome; as to which, however, there are\r\n_cons_ as well as _pros_, for a man who like me is neither Italian nor\r\nCurial in the view of present policies. Secondly, our kind friend Mr.\r\nStuart Rendel has actually offered to be our conductor thither and back,\r\nto perform for us the great service which you rendered us in the trip to\r\nMunich and Saint-Martin. Thirdly, I have the hope that the stimulating\r\nclimate of Naples, together with an abstention from speech greater than\r\nany I have before enjoyed, might act upon my ‘vocal cord,’ and partially\r\nat least restore it.”\r\n\r\nAt Naples he was much concerned with Italian policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 13, 1889._—My stay here where the people really seem to\r\n    regard me as not a foreigner, has brought Italian affairs and\r\n    policy very much home to me, and given additional force and\r\n    vividness to the belief I have always had, that it was sadly\r\n    impolitic for Italy to make enemies for herself beyond the Alps.\r\n    Though I might try and keep back this sentiment in Rome, even my\r\n    silence might betray it and I could not promise to keep silence\r\n    altogether. I think the impolicy amounts almost to madness\r\n    especially for a country which carries with her, nestling in her\r\n    bosom, the “standing menace” of the popedom....\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\n    _To J. Morley._\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 10._—I hope you have had faith enough not to be troubled\r\n    about my supposed utterances on the temporal power.... I will not\r\n    trouble you with details, but you may rest assured I have never\r\n    said the question of the temporal power was anything except an\r\n    Italian question. I have a much greater anxiety than this about\r\n    the Italian alliance with Germany. It is in my opinion an awful\r\n    error and constitutes the great danger of the country. It may be\r\n    asked, “What have you to do with it?” More than people might\r\n    suppose. I find myself hardly regarded here as a foreigner. They\r\n    look upon me as having had a real though insignificant part in the\r\n    Liberation. It will hardly be possible for me to get through the\r\n    affair of this visit without making my mind known. On this account\r\n    mainly I am verging towards the conclusion that it will be best\r\n    for me not to visit Rome, and my wife as it happens is not anxious\r\n    to go there. If you happen to see Granville or Rosebery please let\r\n    them know this.\r\n\r\n    We have had on the whole a good season here thus far. Many of the\r\n    days delicious. We have been subjected here as well as in London\r\n    to a course of social kindnesses as abundant as the waters which\r\n    the visitor has to drink at a watering place, and so enervating\r\n    from the abstraction of cares that I am continually thinking of\r\n    the historical Capuan writer. I am in fact totally demoralised,\r\n    and cannot wish not to continue so. Under the circumstances\r\n    Fortune has administered a slight, a very slight physical\r\n    correction. A land-slip, or rather a Tufo rock-slip of 50,000\r\n    tons, has come down and blocked the proper road between us and\r\n    Naples.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\n    _To Lord Acton._\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 23, 1889._—Rome is I think definitely given up. I shall be\r\n    curious to know your reasons for approving this _gran rifiuto_.\r\n    Meantime I will just glance at mine. I am not so much afraid of\r\n    the Pope as of the Italian government and court. My sentiments are\r\n    so very strong about the present foreign policy. The foreign\r\n    policy of the government but not I fear of the government only. If\r\n    I went to Rome, and saw the King and the minister, as I must, I\r\n    should be treading upon eggs all the time with them. I could not\r\n    speak out uninvited; and it is not satisfactory to be silent in\r\n    the presence of those interested, when the feelings are very\r\n    strong....\r\n\r\n\r\nThese feelings broke out in time in at least one anonymous article.(258)\r\nHe told Lord Granville how anxious he was that no acknowledgment of\r\nauthorship, direct or indirect, should come from any of his friends. “Such\r\nan article of necessity lectures the European states. As one of a public\r\nof three hundred and more millions, I have a right to do this, but not in\r\nmy own person.” This strange simplicity rather provoked his friends, for\r\nit ignored two things—first, the certainty that the secret of authorship\r\nwould get out; second, if it did not get out, the certainty that the\r\nEuropean states would pay no attention to such a lecture backed by no name\r\nof weight—perhaps even whether it were so backed or not. Faith in\r\nlectures, sermons, articles, even books, is one of the things most easily\r\noverdone.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Most of my reading, he went on to Acton, has been about the Jews\r\n    and the Old Testament. I have not looked at the books you kindly\r\n    sent me, except a little before leaving Hawarden; but I want to\r\n    get a hold on the broader side of the Mosaic dispensation and the\r\n    Jewish history. The great historic features seem to me in a large\r\n    degree independent of the critical questions which have been\r\n    raised about the _redaction_ of the Mosaic books. Setting aside\r\n    Genesis, and the Exodus proper, it seems difficult to understand\r\n    how either Moses or any one else could have advisedly published\r\n    them in their present form; and most of all difficult to believe\r\n    that men going to work deliberately after the captivity would not\r\n    have managed a more orderly execution. My thoughts are always\r\n    running back to the parallel question about Homer. In that case,\r\n    those who hold that Peisistratos or some one of his date was the\r\n    compiler, have at least this to say, that the poems in their\r\n    present form are such as a compiler, having liberty of action,\r\n    might have aimed at putting out from his workshop. Can that be\r\n    said of the Mosaic books? Again, are we not to believe in the\r\n    second and third Temples as centres of worship because there was a\r\n    temple at Leontopolis, as we are told? Out of the frying-pan, into\r\n    the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he left Amalfi (Feb. 14) for the north, he found himself, he says, in\r\na public procession, with great crowds at the stations, including Crispi\r\nat Rome, who had once been his guest at Hawarden.\r\n\r\nAfter his return home, he wrote again to Lord Acton:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _April 28, 1889._—I have long been wishing to write to you. But as\r\n    a rule I never can write any letters that I wish to write. My\r\n    volition of that kind is from day to day exhausted by the worrying\r\n    demand of letters that I do not wish to write. Every year brings\r\n    me, as I reckon, from three to five thousand new correspondents,\r\n    of whom I could gladly dispense with 99 per cent. May you never be\r\n    in a like plight.\r\n\r\n    Mary showed me a letter of recent date from you, which referred to\r\n    the idea of my writing on the Old Testament. The matter stands\r\n    thus: An appeal was made to me to write something on the general\r\n    position and claims of the holy scriptures for the working men. I\r\n    gave no pledge but read (what was for me) a good deal on the laws\r\n    and history of the Jews with only two results: first, deepened\r\n    impressions of the vast interest and importance attaching to them,\r\n    and of their fitness to be made the subject of a telling popular\r\n    account; secondly, a discovery of the necessity of reading much\r\n    more. But I have never in this connection thought much about what\r\n    is called the criticism of the Old Testament, only seeking to\r\n    learn how far it impinged upon the matters that I really was\r\n    thinking of. It seems to me that it does not impinge much.... It\r\n    is the fact that among other things I wish to make some sort of\r\n    record of my life. You say truly it has been very full. I add\r\n    fearfully full. But it has been in a most remarkable degree the\r\n    reverse of self-guided and self-suggested, with reference I mean\r\n    to all its best known aims. Under this surface, and in its daily\r\n    habit no doubt it has been selfish enough. Whether anything of\r\n    this kind will ever come off is most doubtful. Until I am released\r\n    from politics by the solution of the Irish problem, I cannot even\r\n    survey the field.\r\n\r\n    I turn to the world of action. It has long been in my mind to\r\n    found something of which a library would be the nucleus. I incline\r\n    to begin with a temporary building here. Can you, who have built a\r\n    library, give me any advice? On account of fire I have half a mind\r\n    to corrugated iron, with felt sheets to regulate the temperature.\r\n\r\n    Have you read any of the works of Dr. Salmon? I have just finished\r\n    his volume on Infallibility, which fills me with admiration of its\r\n    easy movement, command of knowledge, singular faculty of\r\n    disentanglement, and great skill and point in argument; though he\r\n    does not quite make one love him. He touches much ground trodden\r\n    by Dr. Döllinger; almost invariably agreeing with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nJuly 25, 1889, was the fiftieth anniversary of his marriage. The Prince\r\nand Princess of Wales sent him what he calls a beautiful and splendid\r\ngift. The humblest were as ready as the highest with their tributes, and\r\ncomparative strangers as ready as the nearest. Among countless others who\r\nwrote was Bishop Lightfoot, great master of so much learning:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I hope you will receive this tribute from one who regards your\r\n    private friendship as one of the great privileges of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Döllinger:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    If I were fifteen years younger than I am, how happy I would be to\r\n    come over to my beloved England once more, and see you surrounded\r\n    by your sons and daughters, loved, admired, I would almost say\r\n    worshipped, by a whole grateful nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other side, a clever lady having suggested to Browning that he\r\nshould write an inscription for her to some gift for Mr. Gladstone,\r\nreceived an answer that has interest, both by the genius and fame of its\r\nwriter, and as a sign of widespread feeling in certain circles in those\r\ndays:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Surely your kindness, even your sympathy, will be extended to me\r\n    when I say, with sorrow indeed, that I am unable now\r\n    conscientiously to do what, but a few years ago, I would have at\r\n    least attempted with such pleasure and pride as might almost\r\n    promise success. I have received much kindness from that\r\n    extraordinary personage, and what my admiration for his\r\n    transcendent abilities was and ever will be, there is no need to\r\n    speak of. But I am forced to altogether deplore his present\r\n    attitude with respect to the liberal party, of which I, the\r\n    humblest unit, am still a member, and as such grieved to the heart\r\n    by every fresh utterance of his which comes to my knowledge. Were\r\n    I in a position to explain publicly how much the personal feeling\r\n    is independent of the political aversion, all would be easy; but I\r\n    am a mere man of letters, and by the simple inscription which\r\n    would truly testify to what is enduring, unalterable in my esteem,\r\n    I should lead people—as well those who know me as those who do\r\n    not—to believe my approbation extended far beyond the bounds which\r\n    unfortunately circumscribe it now. All this—even more—was on my\r\n    mind as I sat, last evening, at the same table with the\r\n    brilliantly-gifted man whom once—but that “once” is too sad to\r\n    remember.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a gathering at Spencer House in the summer of 1888, when this year of\r\nfelicitation opened, Lord Granville, on behalf of a number of subscribers,\r\npresented Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone with two portraits, and in his address\r\nspoke of the long span of years through, which, they had enjoyed “the\r\nunclouded blessings of the home.” The expression was a just one. The\r\nextraordinary splendour and exalted joys of an outer life so illustrious\r\nwere matched in the inner circle of the hearth by a happy order,\r\naffectionate reciprocal attachments, a genial round of kindliness and\r\nduty, that from year to year went on untarnished, unstrained, unbroken.\r\nVisitors at Hawarden noticed that, though the two heads of the house were\r\nnow old, the whole atmosphere seemed somehow to be alive with the\r\nfreshness and vigour of youth; it was one of the youngest of households in\r\nits interests and activities. The constant tension of his mind never\r\nimpaired his tenderness and wise solicitude for family and kinsfolk, and\r\nfor all about him; and no man ever had such observance of decorum with\r\nsuch entire freedom from pharisaism.\r\n\r\nNor did the order and moral prosperity of his own home (M149) leave him\r\ncomplacently forgetful of fellow-creatures to whom life’s cup had been\r\ndealt in another measure. On his first entry upon the field of responsible\r\nlife, he had formed a serious and solemn engagement with a friend—I\r\nsuppose it was Hope-Scott—that each would devote himself to active service\r\nin some branch of religious work.(259) He could not, without treason to\r\nhis gifts, go forth like Selwyn or Patteson to Melanesia to convert the\r\nsavages. He sought a missionary field at home, and he found it among the\r\nunfortunate ministers to “the great sin of great cities.” In these humane\r\nefforts at reclamation he persevered all through his life, fearless of\r\nmisconstruction, fearless of the levity or baseness of men’s tongues,\r\nregardless almost of the possible mischiefs to the public policies that\r\ndepended on him. Greville(260) tells the story how in 1853 a man made an\r\nattempt one night to extort money from Mr. Gladstone, then in office as\r\nchancellor of the exchequer, by threats of exposure; and how he instantly\r\ngave the offender into custody, and met the case at the police office.\r\nGreville could not complete the story. The man was committed for trial.\r\nMr. Gladstone directed his solicitors to see that the accused was properly\r\ndefended. He was convicted and sent to prison. By and by Mr. Gladstone\r\ninquired from the governor of the prison how the delinquent was conducting\r\nhimself. The report being satisfactory, he next wrote to Lord Palmerston,\r\nthen at the home office, asking that the prisoner should be let out. There\r\nwas no worldly wisdom in it, we all know. But then what are people\r\nChristians for?\r\n\r\nWe have already seen(261) his admonition to a son, and how much importance\r\nhe attached to the dedication of a certain portion of our means to\r\npurposes of charity and religion. His example backed his precept. He kept\r\ndetailed accounts under these heads from 1831 to 1897, and from these it\r\nappears that from 1831 to the end of 1890 he had devoted to objects of\r\ncharity and religion upwards of seventy thousand pounds, and in the\r\nremaining years of his life the figure in this account stands at thirteen\r\nthousand five hundred—this besides thirty thousand pounds for his\r\ncherished object of founding the hostel and library at Saint Deiniol’s.\r\nHis friend of early days, Henry Taylor, says in one of his notes on life\r\nthat if you know how a man deals with money, how he gets it, spends it,\r\nkeeps it, shares it, you know some of the most important things about him.\r\nHis old chief at the colonial office in 1846 stands the test most nobly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nNear the end of 1889 among the visitors to Hawarden was Mr. Parnell. His\r\nair of good breeding and easy composure pleased everybody. Mr. Gladstone’s\r\nown record is simple enough, and contains the substance of the affair as\r\nhe told me of it later:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Dec. 18, 1889._—Reviewed and threw into form all the points of\r\n    possible amendment or change in the plan of Irish government,\r\n    etc., for my meeting with Mr. Parnell. He arrived at 5.30, and we\r\n    had two hours of satisfactory conversation; but he put off the\r\n    _gros_ of it. 19.—Two hours more with Mr. P. on points in Irish\r\n    government plans. He is certainly one of the very best people to\r\n    deal with that I have ever known. Took him to the old castle. He\r\n    seems to notice and appreciate everything.\r\n\r\n\r\nThinking of all that had gone before, and all that was so soon to come\r\nafter, anybody with a turn for imaginary dialogue might easily upon this\r\ntheme compose a striking piece.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1890 Mr. Gladstone spent a week at Oxford of which he\r\nspoke with immense enthusiasm. He was an honorary fellow of All Souls, and\r\nhere he went into residence in his own right with all the zest of a\r\nvirtuous freshman bent upon a first class. Though, I daresay, pretty\r\nnearly unanimous against his recent policies, they were all fascinated by\r\nhis simplicity, his freedom from assumption or parade, his eagerness to\r\nknow how leading branches of Oxford study fared, his naturalness and\r\npleasant manners. He wrote to Mrs. Gladstone (Feb. 1):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Here I am safe and sound, and launched anew on my university\r\n    career, all my days laid out and occupied until the morning of\r\n    this day week, when I am to return to London. They press me to\r\n    stay over the Sunday, but this cannot be thought of. I am received\r\n    with infinite kindness, and the rooms they have given me are\r\n    delightful. Weather dull, and light a medium between London and\r\n    Hawarden. I have seen many already, including Liddon and Acland,\r\n    who goes up to-morrow for a funeral early on Monday. Actually I\r\n    have engaged to give a kind of Homeric lecture on Wednesday to the\r\n    members of the union. The warden and his sisters are courteous and\r\n    hospitable to the last degree. He is a unionist. The living here\r\n    is very good, perhaps some put on for a guest, but I like the tone\r\n    of the college; the fellows are men of a high class, and their\r\n    conversation is that of men with work to do. I had a most special\r\n    purpose in coming here which will be more than answered. It was to\r\n    make myself safe so far as might be, in the articles(262) which\r\n    eighteen months ago I undertook to write about the Old Testament.\r\n    This, as you know perhaps, is now far more than the New, the\r\n    battle-ground of belief. There are here most able and instructed\r\n    men, and I am already deriving great benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething that fell from him one morning at breakfast in the common room\r\nled in due time to the election of Lord Acton to be also an honorary\r\nmember of this distinguished society. “If my suggestion,” Mr. Gladstone\r\nwrote to one of the fellows, “really contributed to this election, then I\r\nfeel that in the dregs of my life I have at least rendered one service to\r\nthe college. My ambition is to visit it and Oxford in company with him.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1890 both Newman and Döllinger died.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have been asked from many quarters, Mr. Gladstone said to Acton,\r\n    to write about the Cardinal. But I dare not. First, I do not know\r\n    enough. Secondly, I should be puzzled to use the little knowledge\r\n    that I have. I was not a friend of his, but only an acquaintance\r\n    treated with extraordinary kindness whom it would ill become to\r\n    note what he thinks defects, while the great powers and qualities\r\n    have been and will be described far better by others. Ever since\r\n    he published his University Sermons in 1843, I have thought him\r\n    unsafe in philosophy, and no Butlerian though a warm admirer of\r\n    Butler. No; it was before 1843, in 1841 when he published Tract\r\n    XC. The _general_ argument of that tract was unquestionable; but\r\n    he put in sophistical matter without the smallest necessity. What\r\n    I recollect is about General Councils: where in treating the\r\n    declaration that they may err he virtually says, “No doubt they\r\n    may—unless the Holy Ghost prevents them.” But he was a wonderful\r\n    man, a holy man, a very refined man, and (to me) a most kindly\r\n    man.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Dr. Döllinger he contributed a charming account to a weekly print,(263)\r\nand to Acton he wrote:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have the fear that my Döllinger letters will disappoint you.\r\n    When I was with him, he spoke to me with the utmost freedom; and\r\n    so I think he wrote, but our correspondence was only occasional. I\r\n    think nine-tenths of my intercourse with him was oral; with\r\n    Cardinal Newman nothing like one-tenth. But with neither was the\r\n    mere _corpus_ of my intercourse great, though in D.’s case it was\r\n    very precious, most of all the very first of it in 1845.... With\r\n    my inferior faculty and means of observation, I have long adopted\r\n    your main proposition. His attitude of mind was more historical\r\n    than theological. When I first knew him in 1845, and he honoured\r\n    me with very long and interesting conversations, they turned very\r\n    much upon theology, and I derived from him what I thought very\r\n    valuable and steadying knowledge. Again in 1874 during a long\r\n    walk, when we spoke of the shocks and agitation of our time, he\r\n    told me how the Vatican decrees had required him to reperuse and\r\n    retry the whole circle of his thought. He did not make known to me\r\n    any general result; but he had by that time found himself wholly\r\n    detached from the Council of Trent, which was indeed a logical\r\n    necessity from his preceding action. The Bonn Conference appeared\r\n    to show him nearly at the standing-point of anglican theology. I\r\n    thought him more liberal as a theologian than as a politician. On\r\n    the point of church establishment he was as impenetrable as if he\r\n    had been a Newdegate. He would not see that there were two sides\r\n    to the question. I long earnestly to know what progress he had\r\n    made at the last towards redeeming the pledge given in one of his\r\n    letters to me, that the evening of his life was to be devoted to a\r\n    great theological construction.... I should have called him an\r\n    anti-Jesuit, but in _no_ other sense, that is in no sense, a\r\n    Jansenist. I never saw the least sign of leaning in that\r\n    direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nHere the reader may care to have a note or two of talk with him in these\r\ndays:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _At Dollis Hill, Sunday, Feb. 22, 1891_.... A few minutes after\r\n    eight Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone came in from church, and we three sat\r\n    down to dinner. A delightful talk, he was in full force, plenty of\r\n    energy without vehemence. The range of topics was pretty wide, yet\r\n    marvellous to say, we had not a single word about Ireland.\r\n    Certainly no harm in that.\r\n\r\n    _J. M._—A friend set me on a hunt this morning through Wordsworth\r\n    for the words about France standing on the top of golden hours. I\r\n    did not find them, but I came across a good line of Hartley\r\n    Coleridge’s about the Thames:—\r\n\r\n    “And the thronged river toiling to the main.”\r\n\r\n    _Mr. G._—Yes, a good line. Toiling to the main recalls Dante:—\r\n\r\n    “Su la marina, dove’l Po discende,\r\n    Per aver pace co’ seguaci sui.”(264)\r\n\r\n    _J. M._—Have you seen Symonds’s re-issued volume on Dante? ’Tis\r\n    very good. Shall I lend it to you?\r\n\r\n    _Mr. G._—Sure to be good, but not in the session. I never look at\r\n    Dante unless I can have a great continuous draught of him. He’s\r\n    too big, he seizes and masters you.\r\n\r\n    _J. M._—Oh, I like the picturesque bits, if it’s only for\r\n    half-an-hour before dinner; the bird looking out of its nest for\r\n    the dawn, the afternoon bell, the trembling of the water in the\r\n    morning light, and the rest that everybody knows.\r\n\r\n    _Mr. G._—No, I cannot do it. By the way, ladies nowadays keep\r\n    question books, and among other things ask their friends for the\r\n    finest line in poetry. I think I’m divided between three, perhaps\r\n    the most glorious is Milton’s—[_Somehow this line slipped from\r\n    memory, but the reader might possibly do worse than turn over\r\n    Milton in search for his finest line._] Or else Wordsworth’s—“Or\r\n    hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn.” Yet what so splendid as\r\n    Penelope’s about not rejoicing the heart of anybody less than\r\n    Odysseus?\r\n\r\n    μηδέ τι χείρονος ἀνδρὸς εὐφραίνοιμι νόημα.(265)\r\n\r\n    He talked a great deal to-night about Homer; very confident that\r\n    he had done something to drive away the idea that Homer was an\r\n    Asiatic Greek. Then we turned to Scott, whom he held to be by far\r\n    the greatest of his countrymen. I suggested John Knox. No, the\r\n    line must be drawn firm between the writer and the man of action;\r\n    no comparisons there.\r\n\r\n    _J. M._—Well, then, though I love Scott so much that if any man\r\n    chooses to put him first, I won’t put him second, yet is there not\r\n    a vein of pure gold in Burns that gives you pause?\r\n\r\n    _Mr. G._—Burns very fine and true, no doubt; but to imagine a\r\n    whole group of characters, to marshal them, to set them to work,\r\n    to sustain the action—I must count that the test of highest and\r\n    most diversified quality.\r\n\r\n    We spoke of the new Shakespeare coming out. I said I had been\r\n    taking the opportunity of reading vol. i., and should go over it\r\n    all in successive volumes. _Mr. G._—“Falstaff is wonderful—one of\r\n    the most wonderful things in literature.”\r\n\r\n    Full of interest in _Hamlet_, and enthusiasm for it—comes closer\r\n    than any other play to some of the strangest secrets of human\r\n    nature—what _is_ the key to the mysterious hold of this play on\r\n    the world’s mind? I produced my favourite proposition that\r\n    _Measure for Measure_ is one of the most modern of all the plays;\r\n    the profound analysis of Angelo and his moral catastrophe, the\r\n    strange figure of the duke, the deep irony of our modern time in\r\n    it all. But I do not think he cared at all for this sort of\r\n    criticism. He is too healthy, too objective, too simple, for all\r\n    the complexities of modern morbid analysis.\r\n\r\n    Talked of historians; Lecky’s two last volumes he had not yet\r\n    read, but—had told him that, save for one or two blots due to\r\n    contemporary passion, they were perfectly honourable to Lecky in\r\n    every way. Lecky, said Mr. G., “has real insight into the motives\r\n    of statesmen. Now Carlyle, so mighty as he is in flash and\r\n    penetration, has no eye for motives. Macaulay, too, is so caught\r\n    by a picture, by colour, by surface, that he is seldom to be\r\n    counted on for just account of motive.”\r\n\r\n    He had been reading with immense interest and satisfaction\r\n    Sainte-Beuve’s _History of Port Royal_, which for that matter\r\n    deserves all his praise and more, though different parts of it are\r\n    written from antagonistic points of view. Vastly struck by\r\n    Saint-Cyran. When did the notion of the spiritual director make\r\n    its appearance in Europe? Had asked both Döllinger and Acton on\r\n    this curious point. For his own part, he doubted whether the\r\n    office existed before the Reformation.\r\n\r\n    _J. M._—Whom do you reckon the greatest Pope?\r\n\r\n    _Mr. G._—I think on the whole, Innocent III. But his greatness was\r\n    not for good. What did he do? He imposed the dogma of\r\n    transubstantiation; he is responsible for the Albigensian\r\n    persecutions; he is responsible for the crusade which ended in the\r\n    conquest of Byzantium. Have you ever realised what a deadly blow\r\n    was the ruin of Byzantium by the Latins, how wonderful a fabric\r\n    the Eastern Empire was?\r\n\r\n    _J. M._—Oh, yes, I used to know my Finlay better than most books.\r\n    Mill used to say a page of Finlay was worth a chapter of Gibbon:\r\n    he explains how decline and fall came about.\r\n\r\n    _Mr. G._—Of course. Finlay has it all.\r\n\r\n    He tried then to make out that the eastern empire was more\r\n    wonderful than anything done by the Romans; it stood out for\r\n    eleven centuries, while Rome fell in three. I pointed out to him\r\n    that the whole solid framework of the eastern empire was after all\r\n    built up by the Romans. But he is philhellene all through past and\r\n    present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V. Breach With Mr. Parnell. (1890-1891)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Fortuna vitrea est,—tum quum splendet frangitur.—PUBLIL. SYRUS.\r\n    Brittle like glass is fortune,—bright as light, and then the\r\n                crash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would have been a miracle if the sight of all the methods of coercion,\r\nalong with the ignominy of the forged letters, had not worked with strong\r\neffect upon the public mind. Distrust began to creep at a very rapid pace\r\neven into the ministerial ranks. The tory member for a large northern\r\nborough rose to resent “the inexpedient treatment of the Irishmen from a\r\nparty point of view,” to protest against the ’straining and stretching of\r\nthe law’ by the resident magistrates, to declare his opinion that these\r\ngentlemen were not qualified to exercise the jurisdiction entrusted to\r\nthem, “and to denounce the folly of making English law unpopular in\r\nIreland, and provoking the leaders of the Irish people by illegal and\r\nunconstitutional acts.”(266) These sentiments were notoriously shared to\r\nthe full by many who sat around him. Nobody in those days, discredited as\r\nhe was with his party, had a keener scent for the drift of popular feeling\r\nthan Lord Randolph Churchill, and he publicly proclaimed that this sending\r\nof Irish members of parliament to prison in such numbers was a feature\r\nwhich he did not like. Further, he said that the fact of the government\r\nnot thinking it safe for public meetings of any sort to be held, excited\r\npainful feelings in English minds.(267) All this was after the system had\r\nbeen in operation for two years. Even strong unionist organs in the Irish\r\npress could not stand it.(268) They declared that if (M150) the Irish,\r\ngovernment wished to make the coercive system appear as odious as\r\npossible, they would act just as they were acting. They could only explain\r\nall these doings, not by “wrong-headedness or imbecility,” but by a\r\nstrange theory that there must be deliberate treachery among the\r\ngovernment agents.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the year 1889 the electoral signs were unmistakable.\r\nFifty-three bye-elections had been contested since the beginning of the\r\nparliament. The net result was the gain of one seat for ministers and of\r\nnine to the opposition. The Irish secretary with characteristic candour\r\nnever denied the formidable extent of these victories, though he mourned\r\nover the evils that such temporary successes might entail, and was\r\nconvinced that they would prove to be dearly bought.(269) A year later the\r\ntide still flowed on; the net gain of the opposition rose to eleven. In\r\n1886 seventy-seven constituencies were represented by forty-seven\r\nunionists and thirty liberals. By the beginning of October in 1890 the\r\nunionist members in the same constituencies had sunk to thirty-six, and\r\nthe liberals had risen to forty-one. Then came the most significant\r\nelection of all.\r\n\r\nThere had been for some months a lull in Ireland. Government claimed the\r\ncredit of it for coercion; their adversaries set it down partly to the\r\noperation of the Land Act, partly to the natural tendency in such\r\nagitations to fluctuate or to wear themselves out, and most of all to the\r\nstrengthened reliance on the sincerity of the English liberals. Suddenly\r\nthe country was amazed towards the middle of September by news that\r\nproceedings under the Coercion Act had been instituted against two\r\nnationalist leaders, and others. Even strong adherents of the government\r\nand their policy were deeply dismayed, when they saw that after three\r\nyears of it, the dreary work was to begin over again. The proceedings\r\nseemed to be stamped in every aspect as impolitic. In a few days the two\r\nleaders would have been on their way to America, leaving a half-empty war\r\nchest behind them and the flame of agitation burning low. As the offences\r\ncharged had been going on for six months, there was clearly no pressing\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nA critical bye-election was close at hand at the moment in the Eccles\r\ndivision of Lancashire. The polling took place four days after a vehement\r\ndefence of his policy by Mr. Balfour at Newcastle. The liberal candidate\r\nat Eccles expressly declared from his election address onwards, that the\r\ngreat issue on which he fought was the alternative between conciliation\r\nand coercion. Each candidate increased the party vote, the tory by rather\r\nmore than one hundred, the liberal by nearly six hundred. For the first\r\ntime the seat was wrested from the tories, and the liberal triumphed by a\r\nsubstantial majority.(270) This was the latest gauge of the failure of the\r\nIrish policy to conquer public approval, the last indication of the\r\ndirection in which the currents of public opinion were steadily\r\nmoving.(271) Then all at once a blinding sandstorm swept the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of those events now occurred that with their stern irony so mock the\r\nstatesman’s foresight, and shatter political designs in their most\r\nprosperous hour. As a mightier figure than Mr. Parnell remorsefully said\r\non a grander stage, a hundred years before, cases sometimes befall in the\r\nhistory of nations where private fault is public disaster.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1889, the Irish leader had been made a party in a suit for\r\ndivorce. He betrayed no trace in his demeanour, either to his friends or\r\nto the House, of embarrassment at the position. His earliest appearance\r\nafter the evil news, was in the debate on the first night of the session\r\n(February 11, ’90), upon a motion about the publication of the forged\r\nletter. Some twenty of (M151) his followers being absent, he wished the\r\ndiscussion to be prolonged into another sitting. Closely as it might be\r\nsupposed to concern him, he listened to none of the debate. He had a\r\nsincere contempt for speeches in themselves, and was wont to set down most\r\nof them to vanity. A message was sent that he should come upstairs and\r\nspeak. After some indolent remonstrance, he came. His speech was\r\nadmirable; firm without emphasis, penetrating, dignified, freezing, and\r\nunanswerable. Neither now nor on any later occasion did his air of\r\ncomposure in public or in private give way.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone was at Hawarden, wide awake to the possibility of peril. To\r\nMr. Arnold Morley he wrote on November 4:—“I fear a thundercloud is about\r\nto burst over Parnell’s head, and I suppose it will end the career of a\r\nman in many respects invaluable.” On the 13th he was told by the present\r\nwriter that there were grounds for an impression that Mr. Parnell would\r\nemerge as triumphantly from the new charge, as he had emerged from the\r\nobloquy of the forged letters. The case was opened two days later, and\r\nenough came out upon the first day of the proceedings to point to an\r\nadverse result. A Sunday intervened, and Mr. Gladstone’s self-command\r\nunder storm-clouds may be seen in a letter written on that day to me:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 16, 1890._—1. It is, after all, a thunder-clap about\r\n    Parnell. Will he ask for the Chiltern Hundreds? He cannot continue\r\n    to lead? What could he mean by his language to you? The Pope has\r\n    now clearly got a commandment under which to pull him up. It\r\n    surely cannot have been always thus; for he represented his\r\n    diocese in the church synod. 2. I thank you for your kind scruple,\r\n    but in the country my Sundays are habitually and largely invaded.\r\n    3. Query, whether if a bye-seat were open and chanced to have a\r\n    large Irish vote W—— might not be a good man there. 4. I do not\r\n    think my Mem. is worth circulating but perhaps you would send it\r\n    to Spencer. I sent a copy to Harcourt. 5. [A small parliamentary\r\n    point, not related to the Parnell affair, nor otherwise\r\n    significant.] 6. Most warmly do I agree with you about the Scott\r\n    _Journal_. How one loves him. 7. Some day I hope to inflict on you\r\n    a talk about Homer and Homerology (as I call it).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe court pronounced a condemnatory decree on Monday, November 17th.\r\nParliament was appointed to meet on Tuesday, the 25th. There was only a\r\nweek for Irish and English to resolve what effect this condemnation should\r\nhave upon Mr. Parnell’s position as leader of one and ally of the other.\r\nMr. Parnell wrote the ordinary letter to his parliamentary followers. The\r\nfirst impulses of Mr. Gladstone are indicated in a letter to me on the day\r\nafter the decree:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 18, 1890._—Many thanks for your letter. I had noticed the\r\n    Parnell circular, not without misgiving. I read in the _P. M. G._\r\n    this morning a noteworthy article in the _Daily Telegraph_,(272)\r\n    or rather from it, with which I very much agree. But I think it\r\n    plain that we have nothing to say and nothing to do in the matter.\r\n    The party is as distinct from us as that of Smith or Hartington. I\r\n    own to some surprise at the apparent facility with which the R. C.\r\n    bishops and clergy appear to take the continued leadership, but\r\n    they may have tried the ground and found it would not _bear_. It\r\n    is the Irish parliamentary party, and that alone to which we have\r\n    to look....\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch were Mr. Gladstone’s thoughts when the stroke first fell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn England and Scotland loud voices were speedily lifted up. Some treated\r\nthe offence itself as an inexpiable disqualification. Others argued that,\r\neven if the offence could be passed over as lying outside of politics, it\r\n(M152) had been surrounded by incidents of squalor and deceit that\r\nbetrayed a character in which no trust could ever be placed again. In some\r\nEnglish quarters all this was expressed with a strident arrogance that set\r\nIrishmen on fire. It is ridiculous, if we remember what space Mr. Parnell\r\nfilled in Irish imagination and feeling, how popular, how mysterious, how\r\ninvincible he had been, to blame them because in the first moment of shock\r\nand bewilderment they did not instantly plant themselves in the judgment\r\nseat, always so easily ascended by Englishmen with little at stake. The\r\npoliticians in Dublin did not hesitate. A great meeting was held at\r\nLeinster Hall in Dublin on the Thursday (November 20th). The result was\r\neasy to foresee. Not a whisper of revolt was heard. The chief nationalist\r\nnewspaper stood firm for Mr. Parnell’s continuance. At least one\r\necclesiastic of commanding influence was supposed to be among the\r\njournal’s most ardent prompters. It has since been stated that the bishops\r\nwere in fact forging bolts of commination. No lurid premonitory fork or\r\nsheet flashed on the horizon, no rumble of the coming thunders reached the\r\npublic ear.\r\n\r\nThree days after the decree in the court, the great English liberal\r\norganization chanced to hold its annual meeting at Sheffield (November\r\n20-21). In reply to a request of mine as to his views upon our position,\r\nMr. Gladstone wrote to me as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 19, 1890._—Your appeal as to your meeting of to-morrow gives\r\n    matter for thought. I feel (1) that the Irish have abstractedly a\r\n    right to decide the question; (2) that on account of Parnell’s\r\n    enormous services—he has done for home rule something like what\r\n    Cobden did for free trade, set the argument on its legs—they are\r\n    in a position of immense difficulty; (3) that we, the liberal\r\n    party as a whole, and especially we its leaders, have for the\r\n    moment nothing to say to it, that we must be passive, must wait\r\n    and watch. But I again and again say to myself, I say I mean in\r\n    the interior and silent forum, “It’ll na dee.” I should not be\r\n    surprised if there were to be rather painful manifestations in the\r\n    House on Tuesday. It is yet to be seen what our Nonconformist\r\n    friends, such a man as ——, for example, or such a man as —— will\r\n    say.... If I recollect right, Southey’s _Life of Nelson_ was in my\r\n    early days published and circulated by the Society for Promoting\r\n    Christian Knowledge. It would be curious to look back upon it and\r\n    see how the biographer treats his narrative at the tender points.\r\n    What I have said under figure 3 applies to me beyond all others,\r\n    and notwithstanding my prognostications I shall maintain an\r\n    extreme reserve in a position where I can do no good (in the\r\n    present tense), and might by indiscretion do much harm. You will\r\n    doubtless communicate with Harcourt and confidential friends only\r\n    as to anything in this letter. The thing, one can see, is not a\r\n    _res judicata_. It may ripen fast. Thus far, there is a total want\r\n    of moral support from this side to the Irish judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\nA fierce current was soon perceived to be running. All the elements so\r\npowerful for high enthusiasm, but hazardous where an occasion demands\r\ncircumspection, were in full blast. The deep instinct for domestic order\r\nwas awake. Many were even violently and irrationally impatient that Mr.\r\nGladstone had not peremptorily renounced the alliance on the very morrow\r\nof the decree. As if, Mr. Gladstone himself used to say, it could be the\r\nduty of any party leader to take into his hands the intolerable burden of\r\nexercising the rigours of inquisition and private censorship over every\r\nman with whom what he judged the highest public expediency might draw him\r\nto co-operate. As if, moreover, it could be the duty of Mr. Gladstone to\r\nhurry headlong into action, without giving Mr. Parnell time or chance of\r\ntaking such action of his own as might make intervention unnecessary. Why\r\nwas it to be assumed that Mr. Parnell would not recognise the facts of the\r\nsituation? “I determined,” said Mr. Gladstone “to watch the state of\r\nfeeling in this country. I made no public declaration, but the country\r\nmade up its mind. I was in some degree like the soothsayer Shakespeare\r\nintroduces into one of his plays. He says, ‘I do not make the facts; I\r\nonly foresee them.’ I did not foresee the facts even; they were present\r\nbefore me.”(273)\r\n\r\n(M153) The facts were plain, and Mr. Gladstone was keenly alive to the\r\nfull purport of every one of them. Men, in whose hearts religion and\r\nmorals held the first place, were strongly joined by men accustomed to\r\nsettle political action by political considerations. Platform-men united\r\nwith pulpit-men in swelling the whirlwind. Electoral calculation and moral\r\nfaithfulness were held for once to point the same way. The report from\r\nevery quarter, every letter to a member from a constituent, all was in one\r\nsense. Some, as I have said, pressed the point that the misconduct itself\r\nmade co-operation impossible; others urged the impossibility of relying\r\nupon political understandings with one to whom habitual duplicity was\r\nbelieved to have been brought home. We may set what value we choose upon\r\nsuch arguments. Undoubtedly they would have proscribed some of the most\r\nimportant and admired figures in the supreme doings of modern Europe.\r\nUndoubtedly some who have fallen into shift and deceit in this particular\r\nrelation, have yet been true as steel in all else. For a man’s character\r\nis a strangely fitted mosaic, and it is unsafe to assume that all his\r\ntraits are of one piece, or inseparable in fact because they ought to be\r\ninseparable by logic. But people were in no humour for casuistry, and\r\nwhether all this be sophistry or sense, the volume of hostile judgment and\r\nobstinate intention could neither be mistaken, nor be wisely breasted if\r\nhome rule was to be saved in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone remained at Hawarden during the week. To Mr. Arnold Morley\r\nhe wrote (Nov. 23): “I have a bundle of letters every morning on the\r\nParnell business, and the bundles increase. My own opinion has been the\r\nsame from the first, and I conceive that the time for action has now come.\r\nAll my correspondents are in unison.” Every post-bag was heavy with\r\nadmonitions, of greater cogency than such epistles sometimes possess; and\r\na voluminous bundle of letters still at Hawarden bears witness to the\r\nemotions of the time. Sir William Harcourt and I, who had taken part in\r\nthe proceedings at Sheffield, made our reports. The acute manager of the\r\nliberal party came to announce that three of our candidates had bolted\r\nalready, that more were sure to follow, and that this indispensable\r\ncommodity in elections would become scarcer than ever. Of the general\r\nparty opinion, there could be no shadow of doubt. It was no application of\r\nspecial rigour because Mr. Parnell was an Irishman. Any English politician\r\nof his rank would have fared the same or worse, and retirement, temporary\r\nor for ever, would have been inevitable. Temporary withdrawal, said some;\r\npermanent withdrawal, said others; but for withdrawal of some sort, almost\r\nall were inexorable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone did not reach London until the afternoon of Monday, November\r\n24. Parliament was to assemble on the next day. Three members of the\r\ncabinet of 1886, and the chief whip of the party,(274) met him in the\r\nlibrary of Lord Rendel’s house at Carlton Gardens. The issue before the\r\nliberal leaders was a plain one. It was no question of the right of the\r\nnationalists to choose their own chief. It was no question of inflicting\r\npolitical ostracism on a particular kind of moral delinquency. The\r\nquestion was whether the present continuance of the Irish leadership with\r\nthe silent assent of the British leaders, did not involve decisive\r\nabstention at the polls on the day when Irish policy could once more be\r\nsubmitted to the electors of Great Britain? At the best the standing\r\ndifficulties even to sanguine eyes, and under circumstances that had\r\nseemed so promising, were still formidable. What chance was there if this\r\nnew burden were superadded? Only one conclusion was possible upon the\r\nstate of facts, and even those among persons responsible for this decision\r\nwho were most earnestly concerned in the success of the Irish policy,\r\nreviewing all the circumstances of the dilemma, deliberately hold to this\r\nday that though a catastrophe followed, a worse catastrophe was avoided.\r\nIt is one of the commonest of all secrets of cheap misjudgment in human\r\naffairs, to start by assuming that there is always some good way out of a\r\nbad case. Alas for us all, this is not so. Situations arise alike (M154)\r\nfor individuals, for parties, and for states, from which no good way out\r\nexists, but only choice between bad way and worse. Here was one of those\r\nsituations. The mischiefs that followed the course actually taken, we see;\r\nthen, as is the wont of human kind, we ignore the mischiefs that as surely\r\nawaited any other.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone always steadfastly resisted every call to express an opinion\r\nof his own that the delinquency itself had made Mr. Parnell unfit and\r\nimpossible. It was vain to tell him that the party would expect such a\r\ndeclaration, or that his reputation required that he should found his\r\naction on moral censure all his own. “What!” he cried, “because a man is\r\nwhat is called leader of a party, does that constitute him a censor and a\r\njudge of faith and morals? I will not accept it. It would make life\r\nintolerable.” He adhered tenaciously to political ground. “I have been for\r\nfour years,” Mr. Gladstone justly argued, “endeavouring to persuade voters\r\nto support Irish autonomy. Now the voter says to me, ‘If a certain thing\r\nhappens—namely, the retention of the Irish leadership in its present\r\nhands—I will not support Irish autonomy.’ How can I go on with the work?\r\nWe laboriously rolled the great stone up to the top of the hill, and now\r\nit topples down to the bottom again, unless Mr. Parnell sees fit to go.”\r\nFrom the point of view of Irish policy this was absolutely unanswerable.\r\nIt would have been just as unanswerable, even if all the dire confusion\r\nthat afterwards came to pass had then been actually in sight. Its force\r\nwas wholly independent, and necessarily so, of any intention that might be\r\nformed by Mr. Parnell.\r\n\r\nAs for that intention, let us turn to him for a moment. Who could dream\r\nthat a man so resolute in facing facts as Mr. Parnell, would expect all to\r\ngo on as before? Substantial people in Ireland who were preparing to come\r\nround to home rule at the prospect of a liberal victory in Great Britain,\r\nwould assuredly be frightened back. Belfast would be more resolute than\r\never. A man might estimate as he pleased either the nonconformist\r\nconscience in England, or the catholic conscience in Ireland. But the most\r\ncynical of mere calculators,—and I should be slow to say that this was Mr.\r\nParnell,—could not fall a prey to such a hallucination as to suppose that\r\na scandal so frightfully public, so impossible for even the most mild-eyed\r\ncharity to pretend not to see, and which political passion was so\r\ninterested in keeping in full blaze, would instantly drop out of the mind\r\nof two of the most religious communities in the world; or that either of\r\nthese communities could tolerate without effective protest so impenitent\r\nan affront as the unruffled continuity of the stained leadership. All this\r\nwas independent of anything that Mr. Gladstone might do or might not do.\r\nThe liberal leaders had a right to assume that the case must be as obvious\r\nto Mr. Parnell as it was to everybody else, and unless loyalty and good\r\nfaith have no place in political alliances, they had a right to look for\r\nhis spontaneous action. Was unlimited consideration due from them to him\r\nand none from him to them?\r\n\r\nThe result of the consultation was the decisive letter addressed to me by\r\nMr. Gladstone, its purport to be by me communicated to Mr. Parnell. As any\r\none may see, its language was courteous and considerate. Not an accent was\r\nleft that could touch the pride of one who was known to be as proud a man\r\nas ever lived. It did no more than state an unquestionable fact, with an\r\ninevitable inference. It was not written in view of publication, for that\r\nit was hoped would be unnecessary. It was written with the expectation of\r\nfinding the personage concerned in his usual rational frame of mind, and\r\nwith the intention of informing him of what it was right that he should\r\nknow. The same evening Mr. McCarthy was placed in possession of Mr.\r\nGladstone’s views, to be laid before Mr. Parnell at the earliest moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _1 Carlton Gardens, Nov. 24, 1890._—MY DEAR MORLEY.—Having arrived\r\n    at a certain conclusion with regard to the continuance, at the\r\n    present moment, of Mr. Parnell’s leadership of the Irish party, I\r\n    have seen Mr. McCarthy on my arrival in town, and have inquired\r\n    from him whether I was likely to receive from Mr. Parnell himself\r\n    any communication on the subject. Mr. McCarthy replied that he was\r\n    unable to give me any information on the subject. I mentioned to\r\n    him that in 1882, after the terrible murder in the Phœnix Park,\r\n    Mr. Parnell, although totally removed from any idea of\r\n    responsibility, had spontaneously written to me, and offered to\r\n    take the Chiltern Hundreds, an offer much to his honour but one\r\n    which I thought it my duty to decline.\r\n\r\n    While clinging to the hope of a communication from Mr. Parnell, to\r\n    whomsoever addressed, I thought it necessary, viewing the\r\n    arrangements for the commencement of the session to-morrow, to\r\n    acquaint Mr. McCarthy with the conclusion at which, after using\r\n    all the means of observation and reflection in my power, I had\r\n    myself arrived. It was that notwithstanding the splendid services\r\n    rendered by Mr. Parnell to his country, his continuance at the\r\n    present moment in the leadership would be productive of\r\n    consequences disastrous in the highest degree to the cause of\r\n    Ireland. I think I may be warranted in asking you so far to expand\r\n    the conclusion I have given above, as to add that the continuance\r\n    I speak of would not only place many hearty and effective friends\r\n    of the Irish cause in a position of great embarrassment, but would\r\n    render my retention of the leadership of the liberal party, based\r\n    as it has been mainly upon the prosecution of the Irish cause,\r\n    almost a nullity. This explanation of my views I begged Mr.\r\n    McCarthy to regard as confidential, and not intended for his\r\n    colleagues generally, if he found that Mr. Parnell contemplated\r\n    spontaneous action; but I also begged that he would make known to\r\n    the Irish party, at their meeting to-morrow afternoon, that such\r\n    was my conclusion, if he should find that Mr. Parnell had not in\r\n    contemplation any step of the nature indicated. I now write to\r\n    you, in case Mr. McCarthy should be unable to communicate with Mr.\r\n    Parnell, as I understand you may possibly have an opening\r\n    to-morrow through another channel. Should you have such an\r\n    opening, I beg you to make known to Mr. Parnell the conclusion\r\n    itself, which I have stated in the earlier part of this letter. I\r\n    have thought it best to put it in terms simple and direct, much as\r\n    I should have desired had it lain within my power, to alleviate\r\n    the painful nature of the situation. As respects the manner of\r\n    conveying what my public duty has made it an obligation to say, I\r\n    rely entirely on your good feeling, tact, and judgment.—Believe me\r\n    sincerely yours, W. E. GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo direct communication had been possible, though every effort to open it\r\nwas made. Indirect information had been received. Mr. Parnell’s purpose\r\nwas reported to have shifted during the week since the decree. On the\r\nWednesday he had been at his stiffest, proudest, and coldest, bent on\r\nholding on at all cost. He thought he saw a way of getting something done\r\nfor Ireland; the Irish people had given him a commission; he should stand\r\nto it, so long as ever they asked him. On the Friday, however (Nov. 21),\r\nhe appeared, so I had been told, to be shaken in his resolution. He had\r\nbethought him that the government might possibly seize the moment for a\r\ndissolution; that if there were an immediate election, the government\r\nwould under the circumstances be not unlikely to win; if so, Mr. Gladstone\r\nmight be thrown for four or five years into opposition; in other words,\r\nthat powerful man’s part in the great international transaction would be\r\nat an end. In this mood he declared himself alive to the peril and the\r\ngrave responsibility of taking any course that could lead to consequences\r\nso formidable. That was the last authentic news that reached us. His Irish\r\ncolleagues had no news at all. After this glimpse the curtain had fallen,\r\nand all oracles fell dumb.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Gladstone’s decision was to have the anticipated effect, Mr.\r\nParnell must be made aware of it before the meeting of the Irish party\r\n(Nov. 25). This according to custom was to be held at two o’clock in the\r\nafternoon, to choose their chairman for the session. Before the choice was\r\nmade, both the leader and his political friends should know the view and\r\nthe purpose that prevailed in the camp of their allies. Mr. Parnell kept\r\nhimself invisible and inaccessible alike to English and Irish friends\r\nuntil a few minutes before the meeting. The Irish member who had seen Mr.\r\nGladstone the previous evening, at the last moment was able to deliver the\r\nmessage that had been confided to him. Mr. Parnell replied that he should\r\nstand to his guns. The other members of the Irish party came together,\r\nand, wholly ignorant of the attitude taken by Mr. Gladstone, promptly and\r\nwith hardly a word of discussion re-elected their leader to his usual\r\npost. The gravity of the unfortunate error (M155) committed in the failure\r\nto communicate the private message to the whole of the nationalist\r\nmembers, with or without Mr. Parnell’s leave, lay in the fact that it\r\nmagnified and distorted Mr. Gladstone’s later intervention into a\r\nhumiliating public ultimatum. The following note, made at the time,\r\ndescribes the fortunes of Mr. Gladstone’s letter:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 25._—I had taken the usual means of sending a message to Mr.\r\n    Parnell, to the effect that Mr. Gladstone was coming to town on\r\n    the following day, and that I should almost certainly have a\r\n    communication to make to Mr. Parnell on Tuesday morning. It was\r\n    agreed at my interview with his emissary on Sunday night (November\r\n    23) that I should be informed by eleven on Tuesday forenoon where\r\n    I should see him. I laid special stress on my seeing him before\r\n    the party met. At half-past eleven, or a little later, on that day\r\n    I received a telegram from the emissary that he could not reach\r\n    his friend.(275) I had no difficulty in interpreting this. It\r\n    meant that Mr. Parnell had made up his mind to fight it out,\r\n    whatever line we might adopt; that he guessed that my wish to see\r\n    him must from his point of view mean mischief; and that he would\r\n    secure his re-election as chairman before the secret was out. Mr.\r\n    McCarthy was at this hour also entirely in the dark, and so were\r\n    all the other members of the Irish party supposed to be much in\r\n    Mr. Parnell’s confidence. When I reached the House a little after\r\n    three, the lobby was alive with the bustle and animation usual at\r\n    the opening of a session, and Mr. Parnell was in the thick of it,\r\n    talking to a group of his friends. He came forward with much\r\n    cordiality. “I am very sorry,” he said, “that I could not make an\r\n    appointment, but the truth is I did not get your message until I\r\n    came down to the House, and then it was too late.” I asked him to\r\n    come round with me to Mr. Gladstone’s room. As we went along the\r\n    corridor he informed me in a casual way that the party had again\r\n    elected him chairman. When we reached the sunless little room, I\r\n    told him I was sorry to hear that the election was over, for I had\r\n    a communication to make to him which might, as I hoped, still make\r\n    a difference. I then read out to him Mr. Gladstone’s letter. As he\r\n    listened, I knew the look on his face quite well enough to see\r\n    that he was obdurate. The conversation did not last long. He said\r\n    the feeling against him was a storm in a teacup, and would soon\r\n    pass. I replied that he might know Ireland, but he did not half\r\n    know England; that it was much more than a storm in a teacup; that\r\n    if he set British feeling at defiance and brazened it out, it\r\n    would be ruin to home rule at the election; that if he did not\r\n    withdraw for a time, the storm would not pass; that if he withdrew\r\n    from the actual leadership now as a concession due to public\r\n    feeling in this country, this need not prevent him from again\r\n    taking the helm when new circumstances might demand his presence;\r\n    that he could very well treat his re-election as a public vote of\r\n    confidence by his party; that, having secured this, he would\r\n    suffer no loss of dignity or authority by a longer or shorter\r\n    period of retirement. I reminded him that for two years he had\r\n    been practically absent from active leadership. He answered, in\r\n    his slow dry way, that he must look to the future; that he had\r\n    made up his mind to stick to the House of Commons and to his\r\n    present position in his party, until he was convinced, and he\r\n    would not soon be convinced, that it was impossible to obtain home\r\n    rule from a British parliament; that if he gave up the leadership\r\n    for a time, he should never return to it; that if he once let go,\r\n    it was all over. There was the usual iteration on both sides in a\r\n    conversation of the kind, but this is the substance of what\r\n    passed. His manner throughout was perfectly cool and quiet, and\r\n    his unresonant voice was unshaken. He was paler than usual, and\r\n    now and then a wintry smile passed over his face. I saw that\r\n    nothing would be gained by further parley, so I rose and he\r\n    somewhat slowly did the same. “Of course,” he said, as I held the\r\n    door open for him to leave, “Mr. Gladstone will have to attack me.\r\n    I shall expect that. He will have a right to do that.” So we\r\n    parted.\r\n\r\n    I waited for Mr. Gladstone, who arrived in a few minutes. It was\r\n    now four o’clock. “Well?” he asked eagerly the moment the door was\r\n    closed, and without taking off cape or hat. “Have you seen him?”\r\n    “He is obdurate,” said I. I told him shortly what had passed. He\r\n    stood at the table, dumb for some instants, looking at me as if he\r\n    could not believe what I had said. Then he burst out that we must\r\n    at once publish his letter to me; at once, that very afternoon. I\r\n    said, “’Tis too late now.” “Oh, no,” said he, “the _Pall Mall_\r\n    will bring it out in a special edition.” “Well, but,” I persisted,\r\n    “we ought really to consider it a little.” Reluctantly he yielded,\r\n    and we went into the House. Harcourt presently joined us on the\r\n    bench, and we told him the news. It was by and by decided that the\r\n    letter should be immediately published. Mr. Gladstone thought that\r\n    I should at once inform Mr. Parnell of this. There he was at that\r\n    moment, pleasant and smiling, in his usual place on the Irish\r\n    bench. I went into our lobby, and sent somebody to bring him out.\r\n    Out he came, and we took three or four turns in the lobby. I told\r\n    him that it was thought right, under the new circumstances, to\r\n    send the letter to the press. “Yes,” he said amicably, as if it\r\n    were no particular concern of his, “I think Mr. Gladstone will be\r\n    quite right to do that; it will put him straight with his party.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe debate on the address had meanwhile been running its course. Mr.\r\nGladstone had made his speech. One of the newspapers afterwards described\r\nthe liberals as wearing pre-occupied countenances. “We were pre-occupied\r\nwith a vengeance,” said Mr. Gladstone, “and even while I was speaking I\r\ncould not help thinking to myself, Here am I talking about Portugal and\r\nabout Armenia, while every single creature in the House is absorbed in one\r\nthing only, and that is an uncommonly long distance from either Armenia or\r\nPortugal.” News of the letter, which had been sent to the reporters about\r\neight o’clock, swiftly spread. Members hurried to ex-ministers in the\r\ndining-room to ask if the story of the letter were true. The lobbies were\r\nseized by one of those strange and violent fevers to which on such\r\noccasions the House of Commons is liable. Unlike the clamour of the Stock\r\nExchange or a continental Chamber, there is little noise, but the\r\nperturbation is profound. Men pace the corridors in couples and trios, or\r\nflit from one knot to another, listening to an oracle of the moment\r\nmodestly retailing a rumour false on the face of it, or evolving monstrous\r\nhypotheses to explain incredible occurrences. This, however, was no common\r\ncrisis of lobby or gallery.\r\n\r\nOne party quickly felt that, for them at least, it was an affair of life\r\nor death. It was no wonder that the Irish members were stirred to the very\r\ndepths. For five years they had worked on English platforms, made active\r\nfriendships with English and Scottish liberals in parliament and out of\r\nit, been taught to expect from their aid and alliance that deliverance\r\nwhich without allies must remain out of reach and out of sight; above all,\r\nfor nearly five years they had been taught to count on the puissant voice\r\nand strong right arm of the leader of all the forces of British\r\nliberalism.\r\n\r\nThey suddenly learned that if they took a certain step in respect of the\r\nleadership of their own party, the alliance was broken off, the most\r\npowerful of Englishmen could help them no more, and that all the dreary\r\nand desperate marches since 1880 were to be faced once again in a blind\r\nand endless campaign, against the very party to whose friendship they had\r\nbeen taught to look for strength, encouragement, and victory. Well might\r\nthey recoil. More astounded still, they learned at the same time that they\r\nhad already taken the momentous step in the dark, and that the knowledge\r\nof what they were doing, the pregnant meanings and the tremendous\r\nconsequences of it, had been carefully concealed from them. Never were\r\nconsternation, panic, distraction, and resentment better justified.\r\n\r\nThe Irishmen were anxious to meet at once. Their leader sat moodily in the\r\nsmoking-room downstairs. His faculty of concentrated vision had by this\r\ntime revealed to him the certainty of a struggle, and its intensity. He\r\nknew in minute detail every element of peril both at Westminster and in\r\nIreland. A few days before, he mentioned to the present writer his\r\nsuspicion of designs on foot in ecclesiastical quarters, though he\r\ndeclared that he had no fear of them. He may have surmised that the\r\ndemonstration at the Leinster Hall was superficial and impulsive. On the\r\nother hand, his confidence in the foundations of his dictatorship was\r\nunshaken. This being so, if deliberate calculation were the universal\r\nmainspring of every statesman’s action—as it assuredly is not nor can ever\r\nbe—he would have spontaneously withdrawn for a season, in the (M156)\r\nassurance that if signs of disorganisation were to appear among his\r\nfollowers, his prompt return from Elba would be instantly demanded in\r\nIreland, whether or no it were acquiesced in by the leaders and main army\r\nof liberals in England. That would have been both politic and decent, even\r\nif we conceive his mind to have been working in another direction. He may,\r\nfor instance, have believed that the scandal had destroyed the chances of\r\na liberal victory at the election, whether he stayed or withdrew. Why\r\nshould he surrender his position in Ireland and over contending factions\r\nin America, in reliance upon an English party to which, as he was well\r\naware, he had just dealt a smashing blow? These speculations, however,\r\nupon the thoughts that may have been slowly moving through his mind, are\r\nhardly worth pursuing. Unluckily, the stubborn impulses of defiance that\r\ncame naturally to his temperament were aroused to their most violent pitch\r\nand swept all calculations of policy aside. He now proceeded passionately\r\nto dash into the dust the whole fabric of policy which he had with such\r\ninfinite sagacity, patience, skill, and energy devised and reared.\r\n\r\nTwo short private memoranda from his own hand on this transaction, I find\r\namong Mr. Gladstone’s papers. He read them to me at the time, and they\r\nillustrate his habitual practice of shaping and clearing his thought and\r\nrecollection by committal to black and white:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 26, 1890._—Since the month of December 1885 my whole\r\n    political life has been governed by a supreme regard to the Irish\r\n    question. For every day, I may say, of these five, we have been\r\n    engaged in laboriously rolling up hill the stone of Sisyphus. Mr.\r\n    Parnell’s decision of yesterday means that the stone is to break\r\n    away from us and roll down again to the bottom of the hill. I\r\n    cannot recall the years which have elapsed. It was daring,\r\n    perhaps, to begin, at the age I had then attained, a process which\r\n    it was obvious must be a prolonged one.\r\n\r\n    Simply to recommence it now, when I am within a very few weeks of\r\n    the age at which Lord Palmerston, the marvel of parliamentary\r\n    longevity, succumbed, and to contemplate my accompanying the cause\r\n    of home rule to its probable triumph a rather long course of years\r\n    hence, would be more than daring; it would be presumptuous. My\r\n    views must be guided by rational probabilities, and they exclude\r\n    any such anticipation. My statement, therefore, that my leadership\r\n    would, under the contemplated decision of Mr. Parnell, be almost a\r\n    nullity, is a moderate statement of the case. I have been\r\n    endeavouring during all these years to reason with the voters of\r\n    the kingdom, and when the voter now tells me that he cannot give a\r\n    vote for making the Mr. Parnell of to-day the ruler of Irish\r\n    affairs under British sanction, I do not know how to answer him,\r\n    and I have yet to ask myself formally the question what under\r\n    those circumstances is to be done. I must claim entire and\r\n    absolute liberty to answer that question as I may think right.\r\n\r\n    _Nov. 28, 1890._—The few following words afford a key to my\r\n    proceedings in the painful business of the Irish leadership.\r\n\r\n    It was at first my expectation, and afterwards my desire, that Mr.\r\n    Parnell would retire by a perfectly spontaneous act. As the\r\n    likelihood of such a course became less and less, while time ran\r\n    on, and the evidences of coming disaster were accumulated, I\r\n    thought it would be best that he should be impelled to withdraw,\r\n    but by an influence conveyed to him, at least, from within the\r\n    limits of his own party. I therefore begged Mr. Justin McCarthy to\r\n    acquaint Mr. Parnell of what I thought as to the consequences of\r\n    his continuance; I also gave explanations of my meaning, including\r\n    a reference to myself; and I begged that my message to Mr. Parnell\r\n    might be made known to the Irish party, in the absence of a\r\n    spontaneous retirement.\r\n\r\n    This was on Monday afternoon. But there was no certainty either of\r\n    finding Mr. Parnell, or of an impression on him through one of his\r\n    own followers. I therefore wrote the letter to Mr. Morley, as a\r\n    more delicate form of proceeding than a direct communication from\r\n    myself, but also as a stronger measure than that taken through Mr.\r\n    McCarthy, because it was more full, and because, as it was in\r\n    writing, it admitted of the ulterior step of immediate\r\n    publication. Mr. Morley could not find Mr. Parnell until after the\r\n    first meeting of the Irish party on Monday. When we found that Mr.\r\n    McCarthy’s representation had had no effect, that the Irish party\r\n    had not been informed, and that Mr. Morley’s making known the\r\n    material parts of my letter was likewise without result, it at\r\n    once was decided to publish the letter; just too late for the\r\n    _Pall Mall Gazette_, it was given for publication to the morning\r\n    papers, and during the evening it became known in the lobbies of\r\n    the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Parnell took up his new ground in a long manifesto to the Irish people\r\n(November 29). It was free of rhetoric and ornament, but the draught was\r\nskilfully brewed. He charged Mr. Gladstone with having revealed to him\r\nduring his visit at Hawarden in the previous December, that in a future\r\nscheme of home rule the Irish members would be cut down from 103 to 32,\r\nland was to be withdrawn from the competency of the Irish legislature, and\r\nthe control of the constabulary would be reserved to the Imperial\r\nauthority for an indefinite period, though Ireland would have to find the\r\nmoney all the time. This perfidious truncation of self-government by Mr.\r\nGladstone was matched by an attempt on my part as his lieutenant only a\r\nfew days before, to seduce the Irish party into accepting places in a\r\nliberal government, and this gross bribe of mine was accompanied by a\r\ndespairing avowal that the hapless evicted tenants must be flung\r\noverboard. In other words, the English leaders intended to play Ireland\r\nfalse, and Mr. Parnell stood between his country and betrayal. Such a\r\nstory was unluckily no new one in Irish history since the union. On that\r\ntheme Mr. Parnell played many adroit variations during the eventful days\r\nthat followed. Throw me to the English wolves if you like, he said, but at\r\nany rate make sure that real home rule and not its shadow is to be your\r\nprice, and that they mean to pay it. This was to awaken the spectre of old\r\nsuspicions, and to bring to life again those forces of violence and\r\ndesperation which it had been the very crown of his policy to exorcise.\r\n\r\nThe reply on the Hawarden episode was prompt. Mr. Gladstone asserted that\r\nthe whole discussion was one of those informal exchanges of view which go\r\nto all political action, and in which men feel the ground and discover the\r\nleanings of one another’s minds. No single proposal was made, no\r\nproposition was mentioned to which a binding assent was sought. Points of\r\npossible improvement in the bill of 1886 were named as having arisen in\r\nMr. Gladstone’s mind, or been suggested by others, but no positive\r\nconclusions were asked for or were expected or were possible. Mr. Parnell\r\nquite agreed that the real difficulty lay in finding the best form in\r\nwhich Irish representation should be retained at Westminster, but both saw\r\nthe wisdom and necessity of leaving deliberation free until the time\r\nshould come for taking practical steps. He offered no serious objection on\r\nany point; much less did he say that they augured any disappointment of\r\nIrish aspirations. Apart from this denial, men asked themselves how it was\r\nthat if Mr. Parnell knew that the cause was already betrayed, he yet for a\r\nyear kept the black secret to himself, and blew Mr. Gladstone’s praise\r\nwith as loud a trumpet as before?(276) As for my own guilty attempt at\r\ncorruption in proposing an absorption of the Irish party in English\r\npolitics by means of office and emolument, I denied it with reasonable\r\nemphasis at the time, and it does not concern us here, nor in fact\r\nanywhere else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come to what was in its day the famous story of Committee Room\r\nFifteen, so called from the chamber in which the next act of this dismal\r\nplay went on.(277) The proceedings between the leader and his party were\r\nwatched with an eagerness that has never been surpassed in this kingdom or\r\nin America. They were protracted, intense, dramatic, and the issue for a\r\ntime hung in poignant doubt. The party interest of the scene was supreme,\r\nfor if the Irishmen should rally to their chief, then the English alliance\r\nwas at an end, Mr. Gladstone would virtually close (M157) his illustrious\r\ncareer, the rent in the liberal ranks might be repaired, and leading men\r\nand important sections would all group themselves afresh. “Let us all keep\r\nquiet,” said one important unionist, “we may now have to revise our\r\npositions.” Either way, the serpent of faction would raise its head in\r\nIreland, and the strong life of organised and concentrated nationalism\r\nwould perish in its coils. The personal interest was as vivid as the\r\npolitical,—the spectacle of a man of infinite boldness, determination,\r\nastuteness, and resource, with the will and pride of Lucifer, at bay with\r\nfortune and challenging a malignant star. Some talked of the famous Ninth\r\nThermidor, when Robespierre fought inch by inch the fierce struggle that\r\nended in his ruin. Others talked of the old mad discord of Zealot and\r\nHerodian in face of the Roman before the walls of Jerusalem. The great\r\nveteran of English politics looked on, wrathful and astounded at a\r\npreternatural perversity for which sixty years of public life could\r\nfurnish him no parallel. The sage public looked on, some with the same\r\ninterest that would in ancient days have made them relish a combat of\r\ngladiators; others with glee at the mortification of political opponents;\r\nothers again with honest disgust at what threatened to be the ignoble rout\r\nof a beneficent policy.\r\n\r\nIt was the fashion for the moment in fastidious reactionary quarters to\r\nspeak of the actors in this ordeal as “a hustling group of yelling\r\nrowdies.” Seldom have terms so censorious been more misplaced. All depends\r\nupon the point of view. Men on a raft in a boiling sea have something to\r\nthink of besides deportment and the graces of serenity. As a matter of\r\nfact, even hostile judges then and since agreed that no case was ever\r\nbetter opened within the walls of Westminster than in the three speeches\r\nmade on the first day by Mr. Sexton and Mr. Healy on the one side, and Mr.\r\nRedmond on the other. In gravity, dignity, acute perception, and that good\r\nfaith which is the soul of real as distinct from spurious debate, the\r\nparliamentary critic recognises them as all of the first order. So for the\r\nmost part things continued. It was not until a protracted game had gone\r\nbeyond limits of reason and patience, that words sometimes flamed high.\r\nExperience of national assemblies gives no reason to suppose that a body\r\nof French, German, Spanish, Italian, or even of English, Scotch, Welsh, or\r\nAmerican politicians placed in circumstances of equal excitement, arising\r\nfrom an incident in itself at once so squalid and so provocative, would\r\nhave borne the strain with any more self-control.\r\n\r\nMr. Parnell presided, frigid, severe, and lofty, “as if,” said one\r\npresent, “it were we who had gone astray, and he were sitting there to\r\njudge us.” Six members were absent in America, including Mr. Dillon and\r\nMr. O’Brien, two of the most important of all after Mr. Parnell himself.\r\nThe attitude of this pair was felt to be a decisive element. At first,\r\nunder the same impulse as moved the Leinster Hall meeting, they allowed\r\ntheir sense of past achievement to close their eyes; they took for granted\r\nthe impossible, that religious Britain and religious Ireland would blot\r\nwhat had happened out of their thoughts; and so they stood for Mr.\r\nParnell’s leadership. The grim facts of the case were rapidly borne in\r\nupon them. The defiant manifesto convinced them that the leadership could\r\nnot be continued. Travelling from Cincinnati to Chicago, they read it,\r\nmade up their minds, and telegraphed to anxious colleagues in London. They\r\nspoke with warmth of Mr. Parnell’s services, but protested against his\r\nunreasonable charges of servility to liberal wirepullers; they described\r\nthe “endeavours to fasten the responsibility for what had happened upon\r\nMr. Gladstone and Mr. Morley” as reckless and unjust; and they foresaw in\r\nthe position of isolation, discredit, and international ill-feeling which\r\nMr. Parnell had now created, nothing but ruin for the cause. This\r\ndeliverance from such a quarter (November 30) showed that either\r\nabdication or deposition was inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe day after Mr. Parnell’s manifesto, the bishops came out of their\r\nshells. Cardinal Manning had more than once written most urgently to the\r\nIrish prelates the moment the decree was known, that Parnell could not be\r\nupheld in London, and that no political expediency could outweigh the\r\nmoral sense. He knew well enough that the bishops in (M158) Ireland were\r\nin a very difficult strait, but insisted “that plain and prompt speech was\r\nsafest.” It was now a case, he said to Mr. Gladstone (November 29), of\r\n_res ad triarios_, and it was time for the Irish clergy to speak out from\r\nthe housetops. He had also written to Rome. “Did I not tell you,” said Mr.\r\nGladstone when he gave me this letter to read, “that the Pope would now\r\nhave one of the ten commandments on his side?” “We have been slow to act,”\r\nDr. Walsh telegraphed to one of the Irish members (November 30), “trusting\r\nthat the party will act manfully. Our considerate silence and reserve are\r\nbeing dishonestly misinterpreted.” “All sorry for Parnell,” telegraphed\r\nDr. Croke, the Archbishop of Cashel—a manly and patriotic Irishman if ever\r\none was—“but still, in God’s name, let him retire quietly and with good\r\ngrace from the leadership. If he does so, the Irish party will be kept\r\ntogether, the honourable alliance with Gladstonian liberals maintained,\r\nsuccess at general election secured, home rule certain. If he does not\r\nretire, alliance will be dissolved, election lost, Irish party seriously\r\ndamaged if not wholly broken up, home rule indefinitely postponed,\r\ncoercion perpetuated, evicted tenants hopelessly crushed, and the public\r\nconscience outraged. Manifesto flat and otherwise discreditable.” This was\r\nemphatic enough, but many of the flock had already committed themselves\r\nbefore the pastors spoke. To Dr. Croke, Mr. Gladstone wrote (Dec. 2): “We\r\nin England seem to have done our part within our lines, and what remains\r\nis for Ireland itself. I am as unwilling as Mr. Parnell himself could be,\r\nto offer an interference from without, for no one stands more stoutly than\r\nI do for the independence of the Irish national party as well as for its\r\nunity.”\r\n\r\nA couple of days later (Dec. 2) a division was taken in Room Fifteen upon\r\na motion made in Mr. Parnell’s interest, to postpone the discussion until\r\nthey could ascertain the views of their constituents, and then meet in\r\nDublin. It was past midnight. The large room, dimly lighted by a few lamps\r\nand candles placed upon the horse-shoe tables, was more than half in\r\nshadow. Mr. Parnell, his features barely discernible in the gloom, held a\r\nprinted list of the party in his hand, and he put the question in cold,\r\nunmoved tones. The numbers were 29 for the motion—that is to say, for him,\r\nand 44 against him. Of the majority, many had been put on their trial with\r\nhim in 1880; had passed months in prison with him under the first Coercion\r\nAct and suffered many imprisonments besides; they had faced storm,\r\nobloquy, and hatred with him in the House of Commons, a place where\r\nobloquy stings through tougher than Hibernian skins; they had undergone\r\nwith him the long ordeal of the three judges; they had stood by his side\r\nwith unswerving fidelity from the moment when his band was first founded\r\nfor its mortal struggle down to to-day, when they saw the fruits of the\r\nstruggle flung recklessly away, and the policy that had given to it all\r\nits reason and its only hope, wantonly brought to utter foolishness by a\r\nsuicidal demonstration that no English party and no English leader could\r\never be trusted. If we think of even the least imaginative of them as\r\nhaunted by such memories of the past, such distracting fears for the\r\nfuture, it was little wonder that when they saw Mr. Parnell slowly casting\r\nup the figures, and heard his voice through the sombre room announcing the\r\nominous result, they all sat, both ayes and noes, in profound and painful\r\nstillness. Not a sound was heard, until the chairman rose and said without\r\nan accent of emotion that it would now be well for them to adjourn until\r\nthe next day.\r\n\r\nThis was only the beginning. Though the ultimate decision of the party was\r\nquite certain, every device of strategy and tactics was meanwhile\r\nresolutely employed to avert it. His supple and trenchant blade was still\r\nin the hands of a consummate swordsman. It is not necessary to\r\nrecapitulate all the moves in Mr. Parnell’s grand manœuvre for turning the\r\neyes of Ireland away from the question of leadership to the question of\r\nliberal good faith and the details of home rule. Mr. Gladstone finally\r\nannounced that only after the question of leadership had been disposed\r\nof—one belonging entirely to the competence of the Irish party—could he\r\nrenew former relations, and once more enter into confidential\r\ncommunications with any of them. There was only one guarantee, he said,\r\nthat could be of any (M159) value to Ireland, namely the assured and\r\nunalterable fact that no English leader and no party could ever dream of\r\neither proposing or carrying any scheme of home rule which had not the\r\nfull support of Irish representatives. This was obvious to all the world.\r\nMr. Parnell knew it well enough, and the members knew it, but the members\r\nwere bound to convince their countrymen that they had exhausted compliance\r\nwith every hint from their falling leader, while Mr. Parnell’s only object\r\nwas to gain time, to confuse issues, and to carry the battle over from\r\nWestminster to the more buoyant and dangerously charged atmosphere of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nThe majority resisted as long as they could the evidence that Mr. Parnell\r\nwas audaciously trifling with them and openly abusing his position as\r\nchairman. On the evening of Friday (December 5) Mr. Sexton and Mr. Healy\r\nwent to Mr. Parnell after the last communication from Mr. Gladstone. They\r\nurged him to bend to the plain necessities of the case. He replied that he\r\nwould take the night to consider. The next morning (December 6) they\r\nreturned to him. He informed them that his responsibility to Ireland would\r\nnot allow him to retire. They warned him that the majority would not\r\nendure further obstruction beyond that day, and would withdraw. As they\r\nleft, Mr. Parnell wished to shake hands, “if it is to be the last time.”\r\nThey all shook hands, and then went once more to the field of action.\r\n\r\nIt was not until after some twelve days of this excitement and stress that\r\nthe scene approached such disorder as has often before and since been\r\nknown in the House of Commons. The tension at last had begun to tell upon\r\nthe impassive bronze of Mr. Parnell himself. He no longer made any\r\npretence of the neutrality of the chair. He broke in upon one speaker more\r\nthan forty times. In a flash of rage he snatched a paper from another\r\nspeaker’s hand. The hours wore away, confusion only became worse\r\nconfounded, and the conclusion on both sides was foregone. Mr. McCarthy at\r\nlast rose, and in a few moderate sentences expressed his opinion that\r\nthere was no use in continuing a discussion that must be barren of\r\nanything but reproach, bitterness, and indignity, and he would therefore\r\nsuggest that those who were of the same mind should withdraw. Then he\r\nmoved from the table, and his forty-four colleagues stood up and silently\r\nfollowed him out of the room. In silence they were watched by the minority\r\nwho remained, in number twenty-six.(278)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nA vacancy at Bassetlaw gave Mr. Gladstone an opportunity of describing the\r\ngrounds on which he had acted. His speech was measured and weighty, but\r\nthe result showed the effect of the disaster. The tide, that a few weeks\r\nbefore had been running so steadily, now turned. The unionist vote\r\nremained almost the same as in 1885; the liberal vote showed a falling off\r\nof over 400 and the unionist majority was increased from 295 to 728.\r\n\r\nAbout this time having to go to Ireland, on my way back I stopped at\r\nHawarden, and the following note gives a glimpse of Mr. Gladstone at this\r\nevil moment (Dec. 17):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I found him in his old corner in the “temple of peace.” He was\r\n    only half recovered from a bad cold, and looked in his worsted\r\n    jacket, and dark tippet over his shoulders, and with his white,\r\n    deep-furrowed face, like some strange Ancient of Days: so\r\n    different from the man whom I had seen off at King’s Cross less\r\n    than a week before. He was cordial as always, but evidently in\r\n    some perturbation. I sat down and told him what I had heard from\r\n    different quarters about the approaching Kilkenny election. I\r\n    mentioned X. as a Parnellite authority. “What,” he flamed up with\r\n    passionate vehemence, “X. a Parnellite! Are they mad, then? Are\r\n    they clean demented?” etc. etc.\r\n\r\n    I gave him my general impression as to the future. The bare idea\r\n    that Parnell might find no inconsiderable following came upon him\r\n    as if it had been a thunder-clap. He listened, and catechised, and\r\n    knit his brow.\r\n\r\n    _Mr. G._—What do you think we should do in case (1) of a divided\r\n    Ireland, (2) of a Parnellite Ireland?\r\n\r\n    _J. M._—It is too soon to settle what to think. But, looking to\r\n    Irish interests, I think a Parnellite Ireland infinitely better\r\n    than a divided Ireland. Anything better than an Ireland divided,\r\n    so far as she is concerned.\r\n\r\n    _Mr. G._—Bassetlaw looks as if we were going back to 1886. For me\r\n    that is notice to quit. Another five years’ agitation at my age\r\n    would be impossible—_ludicrous_ (with much emphasis).\r\n\r\n    _J. M._—I cannot profess to be surprised that in face of these\r\n    precious dissensions men should have misgivings, or that even\r\n    those who were with us, should now make up their minds to wait a\r\n    little.\r\n\r\n    I said what there was to be said for Parnell’s point of view;\r\n    that, in his words to me of Nov. 25, he “must look to the future”;\r\n    that he was only five and forty; that he might well fear that\r\n    factions would spring up in Ireland if he were to go; that he\r\n    might have made up his mind, that whether he went or stayed, we\r\n    should lose the general election when it came. The last notion\r\n    seemed quite outrageous to Mr. G., and he could not suppose that\r\n    it had ever entered Parnell’s head.\r\n\r\n    _Mr. G._—You have no regrets at the course we took?\r\n\r\n    _J. M._—None—none. It was inevitable. I have never doubted. That\r\n    does not prevent lamentation that it was inevitable. It is the old\r\n    story. English interference is always at the root of mischief in\r\n    Ireland. But how could we help what we did? We had a right to\r\n    count on Parnell’s sanity and his sincerity....\r\n\r\n    Mr. G. then got up and fished out of a drawer the memorandum of\r\n    his talk with Parnell at Hawarden on Dec. 18, 1889, and also a\r\n    memorandum written for his own use on the general political\r\n    position at the time of the divorce trial. The former contained\r\n    not a word as to the constabulary, and in other matters only put a\r\n    number of points, alternative courses, etc., without a single\r\n    final or definite decision. While he was fishing in his drawer, he\r\n    said, as if speaking to himself, “It looks as if I should get my\r\n    release even sooner than I had expected.”\r\n\r\n    “That,” I said, “is a momentous matter which will need immense\r\n    deliberation.” So it will, indeed.\r\n\r\n    _Mr. G._—Do you recall anything in history like the present\r\n    distracted scenes in Ireland?\r\n\r\n    _J. M._—Florence, Pisa, or some other Italian city, with the\r\n    French or the Emperor at the gates?\r\n\r\n    _Mr. G._—I’ll tell you what is the only thing that I can think of\r\n    as at all like it. Do you remember how it was at the siege of\r\n    Jerusalem—the internecine fury of the Jewish factions, the\r\n    Ζηλωταί, and the rest—while Titus and the legions were marching on\r\n    the city!\r\n\r\n    We went in to luncheon. Something was said of our friend ——, and\r\n    the new found malady, Renault’s disease.\r\n\r\n    _J. M._—Joseph de Maistre says that in the innocent primitive ages\r\n    men died of diseases without names.\r\n\r\n    _Mr. G._—Homer never mentions diseases at all.\r\n\r\n    _J. M._—Not many of them die a natural death in Homer.\r\n\r\n    _Mr. G._—Do you not recollect where Odysseus meets his mother\r\n    among the shades, and she says:—\r\n\r\n    Οὔτε τις οὖν μοι νοῦσος ἐπήλυθεν ...\r\n    ἀλλά με σός τε πόθος σά τε μήδεα, φαίδιμ᾽ Ὀδυσσεῦ,\r\n    σή τ᾽ ἀγανοφροσύνη μελιηδέα θυμὸν ἀπηύρα.(279)\r\n\r\n    _J. M._—Beautiful lines. Πόθος such a tender word, and it is\r\n    untranslatable.\r\n\r\n    _Mr. G._—Oh, _desiderium_.\r\n\r\n    “Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus\r\n    Tam cari capitis.”(280)\r\n\r\n    _J. M._—The Scotch word “_wearying_” for somebody. And\r\n    _Sehnsucht_.\r\n\r\n    Then Mr. G. went off to his library to hunt up the reference, and\r\n    when I followed him, I found the worn old _Odyssey_ open at the\r\n    passage in the eleventh book. As he left the room, he looked at me\r\n    and said, “Ah, this is very different stuff for talking about,\r\n    from all the wretched work we were speaking of just now. Homer’s\r\n    fellows would have cut a very different figure, and made short\r\n    work in that committee room last week!” We had a few more words on\r\n    politics.... So I bade him good-bye.... #/\r\n\r\n\r\n(M160) In view of the horrors of dissension in Ireland, well-meaning\r\nattempts were made at the beginning of the year to bring about an\r\nunderstanding. The Irish members, returning from America where the schism\r\nat home had quenched all enthusiasm and killed their operations, made\r\ntheir way to Boulogne, for the two most important among them were liable\r\nto instant arrest if they were found in the United Kingdom. They thought\r\nthat Mr. Parnell was really desirous to withdraw on such terms as would\r\nsave his self-respect, and if he could plead hereafter that before giving\r\nway he had secured a genuine scheme of home rule. Some suspicion may well\r\nhave arisen in their minds when a strange suggestion came from Mr. Parnell\r\nthat the liberal leaders should enter into a secret engagement about\r\nconstabulary and the other points. He had hardly given such happy evidence\r\nof his measure of the sanctity of political confidences, as to encourage\r\nfurther experiments. The proposal was absurd on the face of it. These\r\nsuspicions soon became certainties, and the Boulogne negotiations came to\r\nan end. I should conjecture that those days made the severest ordeal\r\nthrough which Mr. Gladstone, with his extreme sensibility and his\r\nabhorrence of personal contention, ever passed. Yet his facility and\r\nversatility of mood was unimpaired, as a casual note or two of mine may\r\nshow:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    ... Mr. G.’s confabulation [with an Irish member] proved to have\r\n    been sought for the purpose of warning him that Parnell was about\r\n    to issue a manifesto in which he would make all manner of\r\n    mischief. Mr. G. and I had a few moments in the room at the back\r\n    of the chair; he seemed considerably perturbed, pale, and\r\n    concentrated. We walked into the House together; he picked up the\r\n    points of the matter in hand (a motion for appropriating all the\r\n    time) and made one of the gayest, brightest, and most delightful\r\n    speeches in the world—the whole House enjoying it consumedly. Who\r\n    else could perform these magic transitions?\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\n    Mr. G. came into the House, looking rather anxious; gave us an\r\n    account of his interview with the Irish deputation; and in the\r\n    midst of it got up to say his few sentences of condolence with the\r\n    Speaker on the death of Mrs. Peel—the closing phrases admirably\r\n    chosen, and the tones of his voice grave, sincere, sonorous, and\r\n    compassionate. When he sat down, he resumed his talk with H. and\r\n    me. He was so touched, he said, by those “poor wretches” on the\r\n    deputation, that he would fain, if he could, make some\r\n    announcement that would ease their unlucky position.\r\n\r\n    [A question of a letter in reply to some application prompted by\r\n    Mr. Parnell. Mr. Gladstone asked two of us to try our hands at a\r\n    draft.] At last we got it ready for him and presently we went to\r\n    his room. It was now six o’clock. Mr. G. read aloud in full deep\r\n    voice the letter he had prepared on the base of our short draft.\r\n    We suggested this and that, and generally argued about phrases for\r\n    an hour, winding up with a terrific battle on two prodigious\r\n    points: (1) whether he ought to say, “after this statement of my\r\n    views,” or “I have now fully stated my views on the points you\r\n    raise”; (2) “You will _doubtless_ concur,” or “_probably_ concur.”\r\n    Most characteristic, most amazing. It was past seven before the\r\n    veteran would let go—and then I must say that he looked his full\r\n    years. Think what his day had been, in mere intellectual strain,\r\n    apart from what strains him far more than that—his strife with\r\n    persons and his compassion for the unlucky Irishmen. I heard\r\n    afterwards that when he got home, he was for once in his life done\r\n    up, and on the following morning he lay in bed. All the same, in\r\n    the evening he went to see _Antony and Cleopatra_, and he had a\r\n    little ovation. As he drove away the crowd cheered him with cries\r\n    of “Bravo, don’t you mind Parnell!” Plenty of race feeling left,\r\n    in spite of union of hearts!\r\n\r\n\r\nNo leader ever set a finer example under reverse than did Mr. Gladstone\r\nduring these tedious and desperate proceedings. He was steadfastly loyal,\r\nconsiderate, and sympathetic towards the Irishmen who had trusted him; his\r\nfirm patience was not for a moment worn out; in vain a boisterous wave now\r\nand again beat upon him from one quarter or another. Not for a moment was\r\nhe shaken; even under these starless skies his faith never drooped. “The\r\npublic mischief,” he wrote to Lord Acton (Dec. 27, 1890), “ought to put\r\nout of view every private thought. But the blow to me is very heavy—the\r\nheaviest I ever have received. It is a great and high call to work by\r\nfaith and not by sight.”\r\n\r\nOccasion had already offered for testing the feeling of Ireland. There was\r\na vacancy in the representation of Kilkenny, and the Parnellite candidate\r\nhad been defeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To J. Morley._\r\n\r\n    _Hawarden, Dec. 23, 1890._—Since your letter arrived this morning,\r\n    the Kilkenny poll has brightened the sky. It will have a great\r\n    effect in Ireland, although it is said not to be a representative\r\n    constituency, but one too much for us. It is a great gain; and yet\r\n    sad enough to think that even here one-third of the voters should\r\n    be either rogues or fools. I suppose the ballot has largely\r\n    contributed to save Kilkenny. It will be most interesting to learn\r\n    how the tories voted.\r\n\r\n    I return your enclosure.... I have ventured, without asking your\r\n    leave, on keeping a copy of a part. Only in one proposition do I\r\n    differ from you. I would rather see Ireland disunited than see it\r\n    Parnellite.\r\n\r\n    I think that as the atmosphere is quiet for the moment we had\r\n    better give ourselves the benefit of a little further time for\r\n    reflection. Personally, I am hard hit. My course of life was\r\n    daring enough as matters stood six weeks ago. How it will shape in\r\n    the new situation I cannot tell. But this is the selfish part.\r\n    Turning for a moment to the larger outlook, I am extremely\r\n    indisposed to any harking back in the matter of home rule; we are\r\n    now, I think, freed from the enormous danger of seeing P. master\r\n    in Ireland; division and its consequences in diminishing force,\r\n    are the worst we have to fear. What my mind leans to in a way\r\n    still vague is to rally ourselves by some affirmative legislation\r\n    taken up by and on behalf of the party. Something of this kind\r\n    would be the best source to look to for reparative strength.\r\n\r\n    _To Lord Acton._\r\n\r\n    _Jan. 9, 1891._—To a greybeard in a hard winter the very name of\r\n    the south is musical, and the kind letters from you and Lord\r\n    Hampden make it harmony as well as melody. But I have been and am\r\n    chained to the spot by this Parnell business, and every day have\r\n    to consider in one shape or other what ought to be said by myself\r\n    or others.... I consider the Parnell chapter of politics finally\r\n    closed for us, the British liberals, at least during my time. He\r\n    has been even worse since the divorce court than he was in it. The\r\n    most astounding revelation of my lifetime.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\n    _To J. Morley._\r\n\r\n    _Hawarden, Dec. 30, 1890._—I must not longer delay thanking you\r\n    for your most kind and much valued letter on my birthday—a\r\n    birthday more formidable than usual, on account of the recent\r\n    disasters, which, however, may all come to good. If I am able to\r\n    effect in the world anything useful, be assured I know how much of\r\n    it is owed to the counsel and consort of my friends.\r\n\r\n    It is not indeed the common lot of man to make serious additions\r\n    to the friendships which so greatly help us in this pilgrimage,\r\n    after seventy-six years old; but I rejoice to think that in your\r\n    case it has been accomplished for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nA few more sentences will end this chapter in Mr. Gladstone’s life. As we\r\nhave seen, an election took place in the closing days of December 1890.\r\nMr. Parnell flung himself into the contest with frantic activity. A fierce\r\nconflict ended in the defeat of his candidate by nearly two to one.(281)\r\nThree months later a contest occurred in Sligo. Here again, though he had\r\nstrained every nerve in the interval as well as in the immediate struggle,\r\nhis candidate was beaten.(282) Another three months, then a third election\r\nat Carlow,—with the same result, the rejection of Mr. Parnell’s man by a\r\nmajority of much more than two to one.(283) It was in vain that his\r\nadherents denounced those who had left him as mutineers and helots, and\r\nexalted him as “truer than Tone, abler than Grattan, greater than\r\nO’Connell, full of love for Ireland as Thomas Davis himself.” On the other\r\nside, he encountered antagonism in every key, from pathetic remonstrance\r\nor earnest reprobation, down to an unsparing fury that savoured (M161) of\r\nthe ruthless factions of the Seine. In America almost every name of\r\nconsideration was hostile.\r\n\r\nYet undaunted by repulse upon repulse, he tore over from England to\r\nIreland and back again, week after week and month after month, hoarse and\r\nhaggard, seamed by sombre passions, waving the shreds of a tattered flag.\r\nIreland must have been a hell on earth to him. To those Englishmen who\r\ncould not forget that they had for so long been his fellow-workers, though\r\nthey were now the mark of his attack, these were dark and desolating days.\r\nNo more lamentable chapter is to be found in all the demented scroll of\r\naimless and untoward things, that seem as if they made up the history of\r\nIreland. It was not for very long. The last speech that Mr. Parnell ever\r\nmade in England was at Newcastle-on-Tyne in July 1891, when he told the\r\nold story about the liberal leaders, of whom he said that there was but\r\none whom he trusted. A few weeks later, not much more than ten months\r\nafter the miserable act had opened, the Veiled Shadow stole upon the\r\nscene, and the world learned that Parnell was no more.(284)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI. Biarritz. (1891-1892)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Omnium autem ineptiarum, quæ sunt innumerabiles, haud sciam an\r\n    nulla sit major, quam, ut illi solent, quocunque in loco,\r\n    quoscunque inter homines visum est, de rebus aut difficillimis aut\r\n    non necessariis argutissime disputare.—CICERO.\r\n\r\n    Of all the numberless sorts of bad taste and want of tact, perhaps\r\n    the worst is to insist, no matter where you are or with whom you\r\n    are, on arguing about the hardest subjects to the full pitch of\r\n    elaboration and detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen how in 1889 Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone celebrated the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of one of the most devoted and successful marriages that ever\r\nwas made, and the unbroken felicity of their home. In 1891, after the\r\nshadows of approaching calamity had for many months hung doubtfully over\r\nthem, a heavy blow fell, and their eldest son died. Not deeply concerned\r\nin ordinary politics, he was a man of many virtues and some admirable\r\ngifts; he was an accomplished musician, and I have seen letters of his to\r\nhis father, marked by a rare delicacy of feeling and true power of\r\nexpression. “I had known him for nearly thirty years,” one friend wrote,\r\n“and there was no man, until his long illness, who had changed so little,\r\nor retained so long the best qualities of youth, and my first thought was\r\nthat the greater the loss to you, the greater would be the consolation.”\r\n\r\nTo Archbishop Benson, Mr. Gladstone wrote (July 6):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is now forty-six years since we lost a child,(285) and he who\r\n    has now passed away from our eyes, leaves to us only blessed\r\n    recollections. I suppose all feel that those deaths which reverse\r\n    the order of nature have a sharpness of their own. But setting\r\n    this apart, there is nothing lacking to us in consolations human\r\n    or divine. I can only wish that I may become less unworthy to have\r\n    been his father.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo me he wrote (July 10):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    We feel deeply the kindness and tenderness of your letter. It\r\n    supplies one more link in a long chain of recollection which I\r\n    deeply prize. Yes, ours is a tribulation, and a sore one, but yet\r\n    we feel we ought to find ourselves carried out of ourselves by\r\n    sympathy with the wife whose noble and absorbing devotion had\r\n    become like an entire life of itself, and who is now face to face\r\n    with the void. The grief of children too, which passes, is very\r\n    sharp while it remains. The case has been very remarkable. Though\r\n    with abatement of some powers, my son has not been without many\r\n    among the signs and comforts of health during a period of nearly\r\n    two and a half years. All this time the terrible enemy was lodged\r\n    in the royal seat, and only his healthy and unyielding\r\n    constitution kept it at defiance, and maintained his mental and\r\n    inward life intact.... And most largely has human, as well as\r\n    divine compassion, flowed in upon us, from none more conspicuously\r\n    than from yourself, whom we hope to count among near friends for\r\n    the short remainder of our lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo another correspondent who did not share his own religious beliefs, he\r\nsaid (July 5):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    When I received your last kind note, I fully intended to write to\r\n    you with freedom on the subject of _The Agnostic Island_. But\r\n    since then I have been at close quarters, so to speak, with the\r\n    dispensations of God, for yesterday morning my dearly beloved\r\n    eldest son was taken from the sight of our eyes. At this moment of\r\n    bleeding hearts, I will only say what I hope you will in\r\n    consideration of the motives take without offence, namely this: I\r\n    would from the bottom of my heart that whenever the hour of\r\n    bereavement shall befall you or those whom you love, you and they\r\n    may enjoy the immeasurable consolation of believing, with all the\r\n    mind and all the heart, that the beloved one is gone into eternal\r\n    rest, and that those who remain behind may through the same mighty\r\n    Deliverer hope at their appointed time to rejoin him.\r\n\r\n    All this language on the great occasions of human life was not\r\n    with him the tone of convention. Whatever the synthesis, as they\r\n    call it,—whatever the form, whatever the creed and faith may be,\r\n    he was one of that high and favoured household who, in Emerson’s\r\n    noble phrase, “live from a great depth of being.”\r\n\r\n\r\nEarlier in the year Lord Granville, who so long had been his best friend,\r\ndied. The loss by his death was severe. As Acton, who knew of their\r\nrelations well and from within, wrote to Mr. Gladstone (April 1):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    There was an admirable fitness in your union, and I had been able\r\n    to watch how it became closer and easier, in spite of so much to\r\n    separate you, in mental habits, in early affinities, and even in\r\n    the form of fundamental convictions, since he came home from your\r\n    budget, overwhelmed, thirty-eight years ago. I saw all the\r\n    connections which had their root in social habit fade before the\r\n    one which took its rise from public life and proved more firm and\r\n    more enduring than the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn September he paid a visit to his relatives at Fasque, and thence he\r\nwent to Glenalmond—spots that in his tenacious memory must have awakened\r\nhosts of old and dear associations. On October 1, he found himself after a\r\nlong and busy day, at Newcastle-on-Tyne, where he had never stayed since\r\nhis too memorable visit in 1862.(286) Since the defeat of the Irish policy\r\nin 1886, he had attended the annual meeting of the chief liberal\r\norganisation at Nottingham (1887), Birmingham (1888), and Manchester\r\n(1889). This year it was the turn of Newcastle. On October 2, he gave his\r\nblessing to various measures that afterwards came to be known as the\r\nNewcastle programme. After the shock caused by the Irish quarrel, every\r\npolitician knew that it would be necessary to balance home rule by reforms\r\nexpected in England and Scotland. No liberal, whatever his particular\r\nshade, thought that it would be either honourable or practical to throw\r\nthe Irish policy overboard, and if there (M162) were any who thought such\r\na course honourable, they knew it would not be safe. The principle and\r\nexpediency of home rule had taken a much deeper root in the party than it\r\nsuited some of the trimming tribe later to admit. On the other hand, after\r\nfive years of pretty exclusive devotion to the Irish case, to pass by the\r\nBritish case and its various demands for an indefinite time longer, would\r\nhave been absurd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the eighties Mr. Gladstone grew into close friendship with one who had\r\nfor many years been his faithful supporter in the House of Commons as\r\nmember for Dundee. Nobody ever showed him devotion more considerate,\r\nloyal, and unselfish than did Mr. Armitstead, from about the close of the\r\nparliament of 1880 down to the end of this story.(287) In the middle of\r\nDecember 1891 Mr. Armitstead planned a foreign trip for his hero, and\r\npersuaded me to join. Biarritz was to be our destination, and the\r\nexpedition proved a wonderful success. Some notes of mine, though intended\r\nonly for domestic consumption, may help to bring Mr. Gladstone in his\r\neasiest moods before the reader’s eye. No new ideas struck fire, no\r\nparticular contribution was made to grand themes. But a great statesman on\r\na holiday may be forgiven for not trying to discover brand-new keys to\r\nphilosophy, history, and “all the mythologies.” As a sketch from life of\r\nthe veteran’s buoyancy, vigour, genial freshness of heart and brain, after\r\nfour-score strenuous years, these few pages may be found of interest.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nWe left Paris at nine in the morning (Dec. 16), and were listening to the\r\nswell of the mighty Bay resounding under our windows at Biarritz soon\r\nafter midnight.\r\n\r\nThe long day’s journey left no signs of fatigue on either Mr. or Mrs.\r\nGladstone, and his only regret was that we had not come straight through\r\ninstead of staying a night in Paris. I’m always for going straight on, he\r\nsaid. For some odd reason in spite of the late hour he was full of stories\r\nof American humour, which he told with extraordinary verve and enjoyment.\r\nI contributed one that amused him much, of the Bostonian who, having read\r\nShakespeare for the first time, observed, “I call that a very clever book.\r\nNow, I don’t suppose there are twenty men in Boston to-day who could have\r\nwritten that book!”\r\n\r\n_Thursday, Dec. 17._—Splendid morning for making acquaintance with a new\r\nplace. Saw the western spur of the Pyrenees falling down to the Bidassoa\r\nand the first glimpse of the giant wall, beyond which, according to\r\nMichelet, Africa begins, and our first glimpse of Spain.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we all sallied forth to look into the shops and to see the\r\nlie of the land. Mr. G. as interested as a child in all the objects in the\r\nshops—many of them showing that we are not far from Spain. The consul very\r\npolite, showed us about, and told us the hundred trifles that bring a\r\nplace really into one’s mind. Nothing is like a first morning’s stroll in\r\na foreign town. By afternoon the spell dissolves, and the mood comes of\r\nDante’s lines, “_Era già l’ora_,” etc.(288)\r\n\r\nSome mention was made of Charles Austin, the famous lawyer: it brought up\r\nthe case of men who are suddenly torn from lives of great activity to\r\ncomplete idleness.\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—I don’t know how to reconcile it with what I’ve always regarded\r\nas the foundation of character—Bishop Butler’s view of habit. How comes it\r\nthat during the hundreds of years in which priests and fellows of Eton\r\nCollege have retired from hard work to college livings and leisure, not\r\none of them has ever done anything whatever for either scholarship or\r\ndivinity—not one?\r\n\r\nMr. G. did not know Mazzini, but Armellini, another of the Roman\r\ntriumvirs, taught him Italian in 1832. (M163) I spoke a word for Gambetta,\r\nbut he would not have it. “Gambetta was _autoritaire_; I do not feel as if\r\nhe were a true liberal in the old and best sense. I cannot forget how\r\nhostile he was to the movement for freedom in the Balkans.”\r\n\r\nSaid he only once saw Lord Liverpool. He went to call on Canning at\r\nGlos’ter House (close to our Glos’ter Road Station), and there through a\r\nglass door he saw Canning and Lord Liverpool talking together.\r\n\r\n_Peel._—Had a good deal of temper; not hot; but perhaps sulky. Not a\r\nfarsighted man, but fairly clear-sighted. “I called upon him after the\r\nelection in 1847. The Janissaries, as Bentinck called us, that is the men\r\nwho had stood by Peel, had been 110 before the election; we came back only\r\n50. Peel said to me that what he looked forward to was a long and fierce\r\nstruggle on behalf of protection. I must say I thought this foolish. If\r\nBentinck had lived, with his strong will and dogged industry, there might\r\nhave been a wide rally for protection, but everybody knew that Dizzy did\r\nnot care a straw about it, and Derby had not constancy and force enough.”\r\n\r\nMr. G. said Disraeli’s performances against Peel were quite as wonderful\r\nas report makes them. Peel altogether helpless in reply. Dealt with them\r\nwith a kind of “righteous dulness.” The Protectionist secession due to\r\nthree men: Derby contributed prestige; Bentinck backbone; and Dizzy\r\nparliamentary brains.\r\n\r\nThe golden age of administrative reform was from 1832 to the Crimean War;\r\nPeel was always keenly interested in the progress of these reforms.\r\n\r\n_Northcote._—“He was my private secretary; and one of the very best\r\nimaginable; pliant, ready, diligent, quick, acute, with plenty of humour,\r\nand a temper simply perfect. But as a leader, I think ill of him; you had\r\na conversation; he saw the reason of your case; and when he left, you\r\nsupposed all was right. But at the second interview, you always found that\r\nhe had been unable to persuade his friends. What could be weaker than his\r\nconduct on the Bradlaugh affair! You could not wonder that the rank and\r\nfile of his men should be caught by the proposition that an atheist ought\r\nnot to sit in parliament. But what is a leader good for, if he dare not\r\ntell his party that in a matter like this they are wrong, and of course\r\nnobody knew better than N. that they were wrong. A clever, quick man with\r\nfine temper. By the way, how is it that we have no word, no respectable\r\nword, for backbone?”\r\n\r\n_J. M._—Character?\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—Well, character; yes; but that’s vague. It means will, I suppose.\r\n(I ought to have thought of Novalis’s well-known definition of character\r\nas “a completely fashioned will.”)\r\n\r\n_J. M._—Our inferiority to the Greeks in discriminations of language shown\r\nby our lack of precise equivalents for φρόνησις, σοφία, σωφροσύνη, etc.,\r\nof which we used to hear so much when coached in the _Ethics_.\r\n\r\nMr. G. went on to argue that because the Greeks drew these fine\r\ndistinctions in words, they were superior in conduct. “You cannot beat the\r\nGreeks in noble qualities.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—I admit there is no Greek word of good credit for the virtue of\r\nhumility.\r\n\r\n_J. M._—ταπεινότης? But that has an association of meanness.\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—Yes; a shabby sort of humility. Humility as a sovereign grace is\r\nthe creation of Christianity.\r\n\r\n_Friday, December 18._—Brilliant sunshine, but bitterly cold; an east wind\r\nblowing straight from the Maritime Alps. Walking, reading, talking. Mr. G.\r\nafter breakfast took me into his room, where he is reading Heine, Butcher\r\non Greek genius, and Marbot. Thought Thiers’s well-known remark on Heine’s\r\ndeath capital,—“To-day the wittiest Frenchman alive has died.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—We have talked about the best line in poetry, etc. How do you\r\nanswer this question—Which century of English history produced the\r\ngreatest men?\r\n\r\n_J. M._—What do you say to the sixteenth?\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—Yes, I think so. Gardiner was a great man. Henry VIII. was great.\r\nBut bad. Poor Cranmer. Like Northcote, he’d no backbone. Do you remember\r\nJeremy Collier’s sentence about his bravery at the stake, which (M164) I\r\ncount one of the grandest in English prose—“He seemed to repel the force\r\nof the fire and to overlook the torture, by strength of thought.”(289)\r\nThucydides could not beat that.\r\n\r\nThe old man twice declaimed the sentence with deep sonorous voice, and his\r\nusual incomparable modulation.\r\n\r\nMr. G. talked of a certain General ——. He was thought to be a first-rate\r\nman; neglected nothing, looked to things himself, conceived admirable\r\nplans, and at last got an important command. Then to the universal\r\nsurprise, nothing came of it; —— they said, “could do everything that a\r\ncommander should do, except say, _Quick march_.” There are plenty of\r\npoliticians of that stamp, but Mr. G. decidedly not one of them. I\r\nmentioned a farewell dinner given to —— in the spring, by some rich man or\r\nother. It cost £560 for forty-eight guests! Flowers alone £150. Mr. G. on\r\nthis enormity, recalled a dinner to Talfourd about copyright at the old\r\nClarendon Hotel in Bond Street, and the price was £2, 17s. 6d. a head. The\r\nold East India Company used to give dinners at a cost of seven guineas a\r\nhead. He has a wonderfully lively interest for these matters, and his\r\ncuriosity as to the prices of things in the shop-windows is inexhaustible.\r\nWe got round to Goethe. Goethe, he said, never gave prominence to duty.\r\n\r\n_J. M._—Surely, surely in that fine psalm of life, _Das Göttliche_?\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—Döllinger used to confront me with the _Iphigenie_ as a great\r\ndrama of duty.\r\n\r\nHe wished that I had known Döllinger—“a man thoroughly from beginning to\r\nend of his life _purged of self_.” Mistook the nature of the Irish\r\nquestions, from the erroneous view that Irish Catholicism is ultramontane,\r\nwhich it certainly is not.\r\n\r\n_Saturday, Dec. 19._—\r\n\r\nWhat is extraordinary is that all Mr. G.’s versatility, buoyancy, and the\r\nrest goes with the most profound accuracy and intense concentration when\r\nany point of public business is raised. Something was said of the salaries\r\nof bishops. He was ready in an instant with every figure and detail, and\r\nevery circumstance of the history of the foundation of the Ecclesiastical\r\nCommission in 1835-6. Then his _savoir faire_ and wisdom of parliamentary\r\nconduct. “I always made it a rule in the H. of C. to allow nobody to\r\nsuppose that I did not like him, and to say as little as I could to\r\nprevent anybody from liking me. Considering the intense friction and\r\ncontention of public life, it is a saving of wear and tear that as many as\r\npossible even among opponents should think well of one.”\r\n\r\n_Sunday, Dec. 20._—At table, a little discussion as to the happiness and\r\nmisery of animal creation. Outside of man Mr. G. argued against Tennyson’s\r\ndescription of Nature as red in tooth and claw. Apart from man, he said,\r\nand the action of man, sentient beings are happy and not miserable. But\r\nFear? we said. No; they are unaware of impending doom; when hawk or kite\r\npounces on its prey, the small bird has little or no apprehension; ’tis\r\ndeath, but death by appointed and unforeseen lot.\r\n\r\n_J. M._—There is Hunger. Is not the probability that most creatures are\r\nalways hungry, not excepting Man?\r\n\r\nTo this he rather assented. Of course optimism like this is indispensable\r\nas the basis of natural theology.\r\n\r\nTalked to Mr. G. about Michelet’s Tableau de la France, which I had just\r\nfinished in vol. 2 of the history. A brilliant tour de force, but strains\r\nthe relations of soil to character; compels words and facts to be the\r\nslaves of his phantasy; the modicum of reality overlaid with violent\r\nparadox and foregone conclusion. Mr. G. not very much interested—seems\r\nonly to care for political and church history.\r\n\r\n_Monday, Dec. 31._—Mr. G. did not appear at table to-day, suffering from a\r\nsurfeit of wild strawberries the day before. But he dined in his dressing\r\ngown, and I had some chat with him in his room after lunch.\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—“’Tis a hard law of political things that if a man shows special\r\ncompetence in a department, that is the very thing most likely to keep him\r\nthere, and prevent his promotion.”\r\n\r\n(M165) _Mr. G._—I consider Burke a tripartite man: America, France,\r\nIreland—right as to two, wrong in one.\r\n\r\n_J. M._—Must you not add home affairs and India? His _Thoughts on the\r\nDiscontents_ is a masterpiece of civil wisdom, and the right defence in a\r\ngreat constitutional struggle. Then he gave fourteen years of industry to\r\nWarren Hastings, and teaching England the rights of the natives, princes\r\nand people, and her own duties. So he was right in four out of five.\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—Yes, yes—quite true. Those two ought to be added to my three.\r\nThere is a saying of Burke’s from which I must utterly dissent. “Property\r\nis sluggish and inert.” Quite the contrary. Property is vigilant, active,\r\nsleepless; if ever it seems to slumber, be sure that one eye is open.\r\n\r\n_Marie Antoinette._ I once read the three volumes of letters from Mercy\r\nd’Argenteau to Maria Theresa. He seems to have performed the duty imposed\r\nupon him with fidelity.\r\n\r\n_J. M._—Don’t you think the Empress comes out well in the correspondence?\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—Yes, she shows always judgment and sagacity.\r\n\r\n_J. M._—Ah, but besides sagacity, worth and as much integrity as those\r\nslippery times allowed.\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—Yes (but rather reluctantly, I thought). As for Marie Antoinette,\r\nshe was not a striking character in any senses she was horribly frivolous;\r\nand, I suppose, we must say she was, what shall I call it—a very\r\nconsiderable flirt?\r\n\r\n_J. M._—The only case with real foundation seems to be that of the _beau\r\nFersen_, the Swedish secretary. He too came to as tragic an end as the\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, Dec. 22._—Mr. G. still somewhat indisposed—but reading away all\r\nday long. Full of Marbot. Delighted with the story of the battle of\r\nCastiglione: how when Napoleon held a council of war, and they all said\r\nthey were hemmed in, and that their only chance was to back out, Augereau\r\nroughly cried that they might all do what they liked, but he would attack\r\nthe enemy cost what it might. “Exactly like a place in the _Iliad_; when\r\nAgamemnon and the rest sit sorrowful in the assembly arguing that it was\r\nuseless to withstand the sovereign will of Zeus, and that they had better\r\nflee into their ships, Diomed bursts out that whatever others think, in\r\nany event he and Sthenelus, his squire, will hold firm, and never desist\r\nfrom the onslaught until they have laid waste the walls of Troy.”(290) A\r\nlarge dose of Diomed in Mr. G. himself.\r\n\r\nTalk about the dangerous isolation in which the monarchy will find itself\r\nin England if the hereditary principle goes down in the House of Lords;\r\n“it will stand bare, naked, with no shelter or shield, only endured as the\r\nbetter of two evils.” “I once asked,” he said, “who besides myself in the\r\nparty cares for the hereditary principle? The answer was, That perhaps ——\r\ncared for it!!”—naming a member of the party supposed to be rather sapient\r\nthan sage.\r\n\r\nNews in the paper that the Comte de Paris in his discouragement was about\r\nto renounce his claims, and break up his party. Somehow this brought us\r\nround to Tocqueville, of whom Mr. G. spoke as the nearest French approach\r\nto Burke.\r\n\r\n_J. M._—But pale and without passion. Who was it that said of him that he\r\nwas an aristocrat who accepted his defeat? That is, he knew democracy to\r\nbe the conqueror, but he doubted how far it would be an improvement, he\r\nsaw its perils, etc.\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—I have not much faith in these estimates, whether in favour of\r\nprogress or against it. I don’t believe in comparisons of age with age.\r\nHow can a man strike a balance between one government and another? How can\r\nhe place himself in such an attitude, and with such comprehensive sureness\r\nof vision, as to say that the thirteenth century was better or higher or\r\nworse or lower than the nineteenth?\r\n\r\n_Thursday, Dec. 24._—At lunch we had the news of the Parnellite victory at\r\nWaterford. A disagreeable reverse for us. Mr. G. did not say many words\r\nabout it, only that it would give heart to the mischief makers—only too\r\ncertain. But we said no more about it. He and I took a walk on the sands\r\nin the afternoon, and had a curious talk (considering), about the\r\nprospects of the church of England. He was (M166) anxious to know about my\r\ntalk some time ago with the Bishop of —— whom I had met at a feast at\r\nLincoln’s Inn. I gave him as good an account as I could of what had\r\npassed. Mr. G. doubted that this prelate was fundamentally an Erastian, as\r\nTait was. Mr. G. is eager to read the signs of the times as to the\r\nprospects of Anglican Christianity, to which his heart is given; and he\r\nfears the peril of Erastianism to the spiritual life of the church, which\r\nis naturally the only thing worth caring about. Hence, he talked with much\r\ninterest of the question whether the clever fellows at Oxford and\r\nCambridge now take orders. He wants to know what kind of defenders his\r\nchurch is likely to have in days to come. Said that for the first time\r\ninterest has moved away both from politics and theology, towards the vague\r\nsomething which they call social reform; and he thinks they won’t make\r\nmuch out of that in the way of permanent results. The establishment he\r\nconsiders safer than it has been for a long time.\r\n\r\nAs to Welsh disestablishment, he said it was a pity that where the\r\nnational sentiment was so unanimous as it was in Wales, the operation\r\nitself should not be as simple as in Scotland. In Scotland sentiment is\r\nnot unanimous, but the operation is easy. In Wales sentiment is all one\r\nway, but the operation difficult—a good deal more difficult than people\r\nsuppose, as they will find out when they come to tackle it.\r\n\r\n[Perhaps it may be mentioned here that, though we always talked freely and\r\nabundantly together upon ecclesiastical affairs and persons, we never once\r\nexchanged a word upon theology or religious creed, either at Biarritz or\r\nanywhere else.]\r\n\r\n_Pitt._—A strong denunciation of Pitt for the French war. People don’t\r\nrealise what the French war meant. In 1812 wheat at Liverpool was 20s. (?)\r\nthe imperial bushel of 65 pounds (?)! Think of that, when you bring it\r\ninto figures of the cost of a loaf. And that was the time when Eaton,\r\nEastnor, and other great palaces were built by the landlords out of the\r\nhigh rents which the war and war prices enabled them to exact.\r\n\r\nWished we knew more of Melbourne. He was in many ways a very fine fellow.\r\n“In two of the most important of all the relations of a prime minister, he\r\nwas perfect; I mean first, his relations to the Queen, second to his\r\ncolleagues.”\r\n\r\nSomebody at dinner quoted a capital description of the perverse fashion of\r\ntalking that prevailed at Oxford soon after my time, and prevails there\r\nnow, I fancy—“hunting for epigrammatic ways of saying what you don’t\r\nthink.” —— was the father of this pestilent mode.\r\n\r\nRather puzzled him by repeating a saying of mine that used to amuse\r\nFitzjames Stephen, that Love of Truth is more often than we think only a\r\nfine name for Temper. I think Mr. G. has a thorough dislike for anything\r\nthat has a cynical or sardonic flavour about it. I wish I had thought, by\r\nthe way, of asking him what he had to say of that piece of Swift’s, about\r\nall objects being insipid that do not come by delusion, and everything\r\nbeing shrunken as it appears in the glass of nature, so that if it were\r\nnot for artificial mediums, refracted angles, false lights, varnish and\r\ntinsel, there would be pretty much of a level in the felicity of mortal\r\nman.\r\n\r\nAm always feeling how strong is his aversion to seeing more than he can\r\nhelp of what is sordid, mean, ignoble. He has not been in public life all\r\nthese years without rubbing shoulders with plenty of baseness on every\r\nscale, and plenty of pettiness in every hue, but he has always kept his\r\neyes well above it. Never was a man more wholly free of the starch of the\r\ncensor, more ready to make allowance, nor more indulgent even; he enters\r\ninto human nature in all its compass. But he won’t linger a minute longer\r\nthan he must in the dingy places of life and character.\r\n\r\n_Christmas Day, 1891._—A divine day, brilliant sunshine, and mild spring\r\nair. Mr. G. heard what he called an admirable sermon from an English\r\npreacher, “with a great command of his art.” A quietish day, Mr. G. no\r\ndoubt engaged in φρονεῖν τὰ ὅσια.\r\n\r\n_Saturday, Dec. 26._—Once more a noble day. We started in a couple of\r\ncarriages for the Négress station, a couple of miles away or more, I with\r\nthe G.’s. Occasion produced the Greek epitaph of the nameless drowned\r\nsailor (M167) who wished for others kinder seas.(291) Mr. G. felt its\r\npathos and its noble charm—so direct and simple, such benignity, such a\r\ngood lesson to men to forget their own misdeeds and mischance, and to pray\r\nfor the passer-by a happier star. He repaid me by two epigrams of a\r\ndifferent vein, and one admirable translation into Greek, of Tennyson on\r\nSir John Franklin, which I do not carry in my mind; another on a\r\nboisterous Eton fellow—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Didactic, dry, declamatory, dull,\r\n    The bursar —— bellows like a bull.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust in the tone of Greek epigram, a sort of point, but not too much\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n_Parliamentary Wit._—Thought Disraeli had never been surpassed, nor even\r\nequalled, in this line. He had a contest with General Grey, who stood upon\r\nthe general merits of the whig government, after both Lord Grey and\r\nStanley had left it. D. drew a picture of a circus man who advertised his\r\nshow with its incomparable team of six grey horses. One died, he replaced\r\nit by a mule. Another died, and he put in a donkey, still he went on\r\nadvertising his team of greys all the same. Canning’s wit not to be found\r\nconspicuously in his speeches, but highly agreeable pleasantries, though\r\nmany of them in a vein which would jar horribly on modern taste.\r\n\r\nSome English redcoats and a pack of hounds passed us as we neared the\r\nstation. They saluted Mr. G. with a politeness that astonished him, but\r\nwas pleasant. Took the train for Irun, the fields and mountain slopes\r\ndelightful in the sun, and the sea on our right a superb blue such as we\r\nnever see in English waters. At Irun we found carriages waiting to take us\r\non to Fuentarabia. From the balcony of the church had a beautiful view\r\nover the scene of Wellington’s operations when he crossed the Bidassoa, in\r\nthe presence of the astonished Soult. A lovely picture, made none the\r\nworse by this excellent historic association. The alcalde was extremely\r\npolite and intelligent. The consul who was with us showed a board on the\r\nold tower, in which _v_ in some words was _b_, and I noted that the\r\nalcalde spoke of Viarritz. I reminded Mr. G. of Scaliger’s epigram—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Haud temere antiquas mutat Vasconia voces,\r\n    Cui nihil est alind vivere quam bibere.\r\n\r\n\r\nPretty cold driving home, but Mr. G. seemed not to care. He found both the\r\nchurches at St. Jean and at Fuentarabia very noteworthy, though the latter\r\nvery popish, but both, he felt, “had a certain association with grandeur.”\r\n\r\n_Sunday, Dec. 27._—After some quarter of an hour of travellers’ topics, we\r\nplunged into one of the most interesting talks we have yet had. _Apropos_\r\nof I do not know what, Mr. G. said that he had not advised his son to\r\nenter public life. “No doubt there are some men to whom station, wealth,\r\nand family traditions make it a duty. But I have never advised any\r\nindividual, as to whom I have been consulted, to enter the H. of C.”\r\n\r\n_J. M._—But isn’t that rather to encourage self-indulgence? Nobody who\r\ncares for ease or mental composure would seek public life?\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—Ah, I don’t know that. Surely politics open up a great field for\r\nthe natural man. Self-seeking, pride, domination, power—all these passions\r\nare gratified in politics.\r\n\r\n_J. M._—You cannot be sure of achievement in politics, whether personal or\r\npublic?\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—No; to use Bacon’s pregnant phrase, they are too immersed in\r\nmatter. Then as new matter, that is, new details and particulars, come\r\ninto view, men change their judgment.\r\n\r\n_J. M._—You have spoken just now of somebody as a thorough good tory. You\r\nknow the saying that nobody is worth much who has not been a bit of a\r\nradical in his youth, and a bit of a tory in his fuller age.\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._ (laughing)—Ah, I’m afraid that hits me rather hard. But for\r\nmyself, I think I can truly put up all the change that has come into my\r\npolitics into a sentence; I (M168) was brought up to distrust and dislike\r\nliberty, I learned to believe in it. That is the key to all my changes.\r\n\r\n_J. M._—According to my observation, the change in my own generation is\r\ndifferent. They have ceased either to trust or to distrust liberty, and\r\nhave come to the mind that it matters little either way. Men are\r\ndisenchanted. They have got what they wanted in the days of their youth,\r\nyet what of it, they ask? France has thrown off the Empire, but the\r\nstatesmen of the republic are not a great breed. Italy has gained her\r\nunity, yet unity has not been followed by thrift, wisdom, or large\r\nincrease of public virtue or happiness. America has purged herself of\r\nslavery, yet life in America is material, prosaic,—so say some of her own\r\nrarest sons. Don’t think that I say all these things. But I know able and\r\nhigh-minded men who suffer from this disenchantment.\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—Italy would have been very different if Cavour had only lived—and\r\neven Ricasoli. Men ought not to suffer from disenchantment. They ought to\r\nknow that _ideals in politics are never realised_. And don’t let us forget\r\nin eastern Europe the rescue in our time of some ten millions of men from\r\nthe harrowing domination of the Turk. (On this he expatiated, and very\r\njustly, with much energy.)\r\n\r\nWe turned to our own country. Here he insisted that democracy had\r\ncertainly not saved us from a distinct decline in the standard of public\r\nmen.... Look at the whole conduct of opposition from ’80 to ’85—every\r\nprinciple was flung overboard, if they could manufacture a combination\r\nagainst the government. For all this deterioration one man and one man\r\nalone is responsible, Disraeli. He is the grand corrupter. He it was who\r\nsowed the seed.\r\n\r\n_J. M._—Ought not Palmerston to bear some share in this?\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—No, no; Pam. had many strong and liberal convictions. On one\r\nsubject Dizzy had them too—the Jews. There he was much more than rational,\r\nhe was fanatical. He said once that Providence would deal good or ill\r\nfortune to nations, according as they dealt well or ill by the Jews. I\r\nremember once sitting next to John Russell when D. was making a speech on\r\nJewish emancipation. “Look at him,” said J. R., “how manfully he sticks to\r\nit, tho’ he knows that every word he says is gall and wormwood to every\r\nman who sits around him and behind him.” A curious irony, was it not, that\r\nit should have fallen to me to propose a motion for a memorial both to\r\nPam. and Dizzy?\r\n\r\nA superb scene upon the ocean, with a grand wind from the west. Mr. G. and\r\nI walked on the shore; he has a passion for tumultuous seas. I have never\r\nseen such huge masses of water shattering themselves among the rocks.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Mr. G. remarked on our debt to Macaulay, for guarding the\r\npurity of the English tongue. I recalled a favourite passage from Milton,\r\nthat next to the man who gives wise and intrepid counsels of government,\r\nhe places the man who cares for the purity of his mother tongue. Mr. G.\r\nliked this. Said he only knew Bright once slip into an error in this\r\nrespect, when he used “transpire” for “happen.” Macaulay of good example\r\nalso in rigorously abstaining from the inclusion of matter in footnotes.\r\nHallam an offender in this respect. I pointed out that he offended in\r\ncompany with Gibbon.\r\n\r\n_Monday, Dec. 28._—We had an animated hour at breakfast.\r\n\r\n_Oxford and Cambridge._—Curious how, like two buckets, whenever one was\r\nup, the other was down. Cambridge has never produced four such men of\r\naction in successive ages as Wolsey, Laud, Wesley, and Newman.\r\n\r\n_J. M._—In the region of thought Cambridge has produced the greatest of\r\nall names, Newton.\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—In the earlier times Oxford has it—with Wycliff, Occam, above all\r\nRoger Bacon. And then in the eighteenth century, Butler.\r\n\r\n_J. M._—But why not Locke, too, in the century before?\r\n\r\nThis brought on a tremendous tussle, for Mr. G. was of the same mind, and\r\nperhaps for the same sort of reason, as Joseph de Maistre, that contempt\r\nfor Locke is the beginning of knowledge. All very well for De Maistre, but\r\nnot for a man in line with European liberalism. I pressed the very obvious\r\npoint that you must take into account not only a man’s intellectual\r\nproduct or his general stature, but also (M169) his influence as a\r\nhistoric force. From the point of view of influence Locke was the origin\r\nof the emancipatory movement of the eighteenth century abroad, and laid\r\nthe philosophic foundations of liberalism in civil government at home. Mr.\r\nG. insisted on a passage of Hume’s which he believed to be in the history,\r\ndisparaging Locke as a metaphysical thinker.(292) “That may be,” said I,\r\n“though Hume in his _Essays_ is not above paying many compliments to ‘the\r\ngreat reasoner,’ etc., to whom, for that matter, I fancy that he stood in\r\npretty direct relation. But far be it from me to deny that Hume saw deeper\r\nthan Locke into the metaphysical millstone. That is not the point. I’m\r\nonly thinking of his historic place, and, after all, the history of\r\nphilosophy is itself a philosophy.” To minds nursed in dogmatic schools,\r\nall this is both unpalatable and incredible.\r\n\r\nSomehow we slid into the freedom of the will and Jonathan Edwards. I told\r\nhim that Mill had often told us how Edwards argued the necessarian or\r\ndeterminist case as keenly as any modern.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, Dec. 29._—Mr. G. 82 to-day. I gave him Mackail’s Greek Epigrams,\r\nand if it affords him half as much pleasure as it has given me, he will be\r\nvery grateful. Various people brought Mr. G. bouquets and addresses. Mr.\r\nG. went to church in the morning, and in the afternoon took a walk with\r\nme.... _Land Question._ As you go through France you see the soil\r\ncultivated by the population. In our little dash into Spain the other day,\r\nwe saw again the soil cultivated by the population. In England it is\r\ncultivated by the capitalist, for the farmer is capitalist. Some\r\nastonishing views recently propounded by D. of Argyll on this matter.\r\nUnearned increment—so terribly difficult to catch it. Perhaps best try to\r\nget at it through the death duties. Physical condition of our\r\npeople—always a subject of great anxiety—their stature, colour, and so on.\r\nFeared the atmosphere of cotton factories, etc., very deleterious. As\r\nagainst bad air, I said, you must set good food; the Lancashire operative\r\nin decent times lives uncommonly well, as he deserves to do. He agreed\r\nthere might be something in this.\r\n\r\nThe day was humid and muggy, but the tumult of the sea was most majestic.\r\nMr. G. delighted in it. He has a passion for the sound of the sea; would\r\nlike to have it in his ear all day and all night. Again and again he\r\nrecurred to this.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, long talk about Mazzini, of whom Mr. G. thought poorly in\r\ncomparison with Poerio and the others who for freedom sacrificed their\r\nlives. I stood up for Mazzini, as one of the most morally impressive men I\r\nhad ever known, or that his age knew; he breathed a soul into democracy.\r\n\r\nThen we fell into a discussion as to the eastern and western churches. He\r\nthought the western popes by their proffered alliance with the mahometans,\r\netc., had betrayed Christianity in the east. I offered De Maistre’s view.\r\n\r\nMr. G. strongly assented to old Chatham’s dictum that vacancy is worse\r\nthan even the most anxious work. He has less to reproach himself with than\r\nmost men under that head.\r\n\r\nHe repeated an observation that I have heard him make before, that he\r\nthought politicians are more _rapid_ than other people. I told him that\r\nBowen once said to me on this that he did not agree; that he thought\r\nrapidity the mark of all successful men in the practical line of life,\r\nmerchants and stockbrokers, etc.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, Dec. 30._—A very muggy day. A divine sunset, with the\r\nloveliest pink and opal tints in the sky. Mr. G. reading Gleig’s\r\n_Subaltern_. Not a very entertaining book in itself, but the incidents\r\nbelong to Wellington’s Pyrenean campaign, and, for my own part, I rather\r\nenjoyed it on the principle on which one likes reading _Romola_ at\r\nFlorence, _Transformation_ at Rome, _Sylvia’s Lovers_ at Whitby, and\r\n_Hurrish_ on the northern edge of Clare.\r\n\r\n_Thursday, Dec. 31._—Down to the pier, and found all the party watching\r\nthe breakers, and superb they were. Mr. G. exulting in the huge force of\r\nthe Atlantic swell and the beat of the rollers on the shore, like a\r\nTitanic pulse.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Mr. G. raised the question of payment of members. He had been\r\nasked by somebody whether he meant at Newcastle to indicate that everybody\r\nshould be paid, or only those who chose to take it or to ask (M170) for\r\nit. He produced the same extraordinary plan as he had described to me on\r\nthe morning of his Newcastle speech—_i.e._ that the Inland Revenue should\r\nascertain from their own books the income of every M.P., and if they found\r\nany below the limit of exemption, should notify the same to the Speaker,\r\nand the Speaker should thereupon send to the said M.P. below the limit an\r\nannual cheque for, say, £300, the name to appear in an annual return to\r\nParliament of all the M.P.’s in receipt of public money on any grounds\r\nwhatever. I demurred to this altogether, as drawing an invidious\r\ndistinction between paid and unpaid members; said it was idle to ignore\r\nthe theory on which the demand for paid members is based, namely, that it\r\nis desirable in the public interest that poor men should have access to\r\nthe H. of C.; and that the poor man should stand there on the same footing\r\nas anybody else.\r\n\r\n_Friday, Jan. 1, 1892._—After breakfast Mrs. Gladstone came to my room and\r\nsaid how glad she was that I had not scrupled to put unpleasant points;\r\nthat Mr. G. must not be shielded and sheltered as some great people are,\r\nwho hear all the pleasant things and none of the unpleasant; that the\r\nperturbation from what is disagreeable only lasts an hour. I said I hoped\r\nthat I was faithful with him, but of course I could not be always putting\r\nmyself in an attitude of perpetual controversy. She said, “He is never\r\nmade angry by what you say.” And so she went away, and —— and I had a good\r\nand most useful set-to about Irish finance.\r\n\r\nAt luncheon Mr. G. asked what we had made out of our morning’s work. When\r\nwe told him he showed a good deal of impatience and vehemence, and, to my\r\ndismay, he came upon union finance and the general subject of the\r\ntreatment of Ireland by England....\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we took a walk, he and I, afterwards joined by the rest.\r\nHe was as delighted as ever with the swell of the waves, as they bounded\r\nover one another, with every variety of grace and tumultuous power. He\r\nwondered if we had not more and better words for the sea than the\r\nFrench—“breaker,” “billow,” “roller,” as against “flot,” “vague,” “onde,”\r\n“lame,” etc.\r\n\r\nAt dinner he asked me whether I had made up my mind on the burning\r\nquestion of compulsory Greek for a university degree. I said, No, that as\r\nthen advised I was half inclined to be against compulsory Greek, but it is\r\nso important that I would not decide before I was obliged. “So with me,”\r\nhe said, “the question is one with many subtle and deep-reaching\r\nconsequences.” He dwelt on the folly of striking Italian out of the course\r\nof modern education, thus cutting European history in two, and setting an\r\nartificial gulf between the ancient and modern worlds.\r\n\r\n_Saturday, Jan. 2._—Superb morning, and all the better for being much\r\ncooler. At breakfast somebody started the idle topic of quill pens. When\r\nthey came to the length of time that so-and-so made a quill serve, “De\r\nRetz,” said I, “made up his mind that Cardinal Chigi was a poor creature,\r\n_maximus in minimis_, because at their first interview Chigi boasted that\r\nhe had used one pen for three years.” That recalled another saying of\r\nRetz’s about Cromwell’s famous dictum, that nobody goes so far as the man\r\nwho does not know where he is going. Mr. G. gave his deep and eager Ah! to\r\nthis. He could not recall that Cromwell had produced many dicta of such\r\nquality. “I don’t love him, but he was a mighty big fellow. But he was\r\nintolerant. He was intolerant of the episcopalians.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—Do you know whom I find the most tolerant churchman of that time?\r\n_Laud!_ Laud got Davenant made Bishop of Salisbury, and he zealously\r\nbefriended Chillingworth and Hales. (There was some other case, which I\r\nforget.)\r\n\r\n_The execution of Charles._—I told him of Gardiner’s new volume which I\r\nhad just been reading. “Charles,” he said, “was no doubt a dreadful liar;\r\nCromwell perhaps did not always tell the truth; Elizabeth was a tremendous\r\nliar.”\r\n\r\n_J. M._—Charles was not wholly inexcusable, being what he was, for\r\nthinking that he had a good game in his hands, by playing off the\r\nparliament against the army, etc.\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—There was less excuse for cutting off his head than in the case\r\nof poor Louis XVI., for Louis was the excuse for foreign invasion.\r\n\r\n(M171) _J. M._—Could you call foreign invasion the intervention of the\r\nScotch?\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—Well, not quite. I suppose it is certain that it was Cromwell who\r\ncut off Charles’s head? Not one in a hundred in the nation desired it.\r\n\r\n_J. M._—No, nor one in twenty in the parliament. But then, ninety-nine in\r\na hundred in the army.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we all drove towards Bayonne to watch the ships struggle\r\nover the bar at high water. As it happened we only saw one pass out, a\r\ncountryman for Cardiff. A string of others were waiting to go, but a\r\nlittle steamer from Nantes came first, and having secured her station,\r\nfound she had not force enough to make the bar, and the others remained\r\nswearing impatiently behind her. The Nantes steamer was like Ireland. The\r\nscene was very fresh and fine, and the cold most exhilarating after the\r\nmugginess of the last two or three days. Mr. G., who has a dizzy head, did\r\nnot venture on the jetty, but watched things from the sands. He and I\r\ndrove home together, at a good pace. “I am inclined,” he said laughingly,\r\n“to agree with Dr. Johnson that there is no pleasure greater than sitting\r\nbehind four fast-going horses.”(293) Talking of Johnson generally, “I\r\nsuppose we may take him as the best product of the eighteenth century.”\r\nPerhaps so, but is he its most characteristic product?\r\n\r\n_Wellington._—Curious that there should be no general estimate of W.’s\r\ncharacter; his character not merely as a general but as a man. No love of\r\nfreedom. His sense of duty very strong, but military rather than civil.\r\n\r\n_Montalembert._—Had often come into contact with him. A very amiable and\r\nattractive man. But less remarkable than Rio.\r\n\r\n_Latin Poets._—Would you place Virgil first?\r\n\r\n_J. M._—Oh, no, Lucretius much the first for the greatest and sublimest of\r\npoetic qualities. Mr. G. seemed to assent to this, though disposed to make\r\na fight for the second _Aeneid_ as equal to anything. He expressed his\r\nadmiration for Catullus, and then he was strong that Horace would run\r\nanybody else very hard, breaking out with the lines about Regulus—\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Atqui sciebat quæ sibi barbarus\r\n    Tortor pararet;” etc.(294)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Blunders in Government._—How right Napoleon was when he said, reflecting\r\non all the vast complexities of government, that the best to be said of a\r\nstatesman is that he has avoided the biggest blunders.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to define the charm of these conversations. Is charm the\r\nright word? They are in the highest degree stimulating, bracing, widening.\r\nThat is certain. I return to my room with the sensations of a man who has\r\ntaken delightful exercise in fresh air. He is so wholly free from the\r\n_ergoteur_. There’s all the difference between the _ergoteur_ and the\r\ngreat debater. He fits his tone to the thing; he can be as playful as\r\nanybody. In truth I have many a time seen him in London and at Hawarden\r\nnot far from trivial. But here at Biarritz all is appropriate, and though,\r\nas I say, he can be playful and gay as youth, he cannot resist rising in\r\nan instant to the general point of view—to grasp the elemental\r\nconsiderations of character, history, belief, conduct, affairs. There he\r\nis at home, there he is most himself. I never knew anybody less guilty of\r\nthe tiresome sin of arguing for victory. It is not his knowledge that\r\nattracts; it is not his ethical tests and standards; it is not that\r\ndialectical strength of arm which, as Mark Pattison said of him, could\r\ntwist a bar of iron to its purpose. It is the combination of these with\r\nelevation, with true sincerity, with extraordinary mental force.\r\n\r\n_Sunday, Jan. 3._—Vauvenargues is right when he says that to carry through\r\ngreat undertakings, one must act as though one could never die. My\r\nwonderful companion is a wonderful illustration. He is like M. Angelo,\r\nwho, just before he died on the very edge of ninety, made an allegorical\r\nfigure, and inscribed upon it, _ancora impara_, “still learning.”\r\n\r\nAt dinner he showed in full force.\r\n\r\n(M172) _Heroes of the Old Testament._—He could not honestly say that he\r\nthought there was any figure in the O. T. comparable to the heroes of\r\nHomer. Moses was a fine fellow. But the others were of secondary\r\nquality—not great high personages, of commanding nature.\r\n\r\n_Thinkers._—Rather an absurd word—to call a man a thinker (and he repeated\r\nthe word with gay mockery in his tone). When did it come into use? Not\r\nuntil quite our own times, eh? I said, I believed both Hobbes and Locke\r\nspoke of thinkers, and was pretty sure that _penseur_, as in _libre\r\npenseur_, had established itself in the last century. [Quite true;\r\nVoltaire used it, but it was not common.]\r\n\r\n_Dr. Arnold._—A high, large, impressive figure—perhaps more important by\r\nhis character and personality than his actual work. I mentioned M. A.’s\r\npoem on his father, _Rugby Chapel_, with admiration. Rather to my\r\nsurprise, Mr. G. knew the poem well, and shared my admiration to the full.\r\nThis brought us on to poetry generally, and he expatiated with much\r\neloquence and sincerity for the rest of the talk. The wonderful continuity\r\nof fine poetry in England for five whole centuries, stretching from\r\nChaucer to Tennyson, always a proof to his mind of the soundness, the sap,\r\nand the vitality of our nation and its character. What people, beginning\r\nwith such a poet as Chaucer 500 years ago, could have burst forth into\r\nsuch astonishing production of poetry as marked the first quarter of the\r\ncentury, Byron, Wordsworth, Shelley, etc.\r\n\r\n_J. M._—It is true that Germany has nothing, save Goethe, Schiller, Heine,\r\nthat’s her whole list. But I should say a word for the poetic movement in\r\nFrance: Hugo, Gautier, etc. Mr. G. evidently knew but little, or even\r\nnothing, of modern French poetry. He spoke up for Leopardi, on whom he had\r\nwritten an article first introducing him to the British public, ever so\r\nmany years ago—in the _Quarterly_.\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—Wordsworth used occasionally to dine with me when I lived in the\r\nAlbany. A most agreeable man. I always found him amiable, polite, and\r\nsympathetic. Only once did he jar upon me, when he spoke slightingly of\r\nTennyson’s first performance.\r\n\r\n_J. M._—But he was not so wrong as he would be now. Tennyson’s Juvenilia\r\nare terribly artificial.\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—Yes, perhaps. Tennyson has himself withdrawn some of them. I\r\nremember W., when he dined with me, used on leaving to change his silk\r\nstockings in the anteroom and put on grey worsted.\r\n\r\n_J. M._—I once said to M. Arnold that I’d rather have been Wordsworth than\r\nanybody [not exactly a modest ambition]; and Arnold, who knew him well in\r\nthe Grasmere country, said, “Oh no, you would not; you would wish you were\r\ndining with me at the Athenæum. He was too much of the peasant for you.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—No, I never felt that; I always thought him a polite and an\r\namiable man.\r\n\r\nMentioned Macaulay’s strange judgment in a note in the _History_, that\r\nDryden’s famous lines,\r\n\r\n\r\n    “... Fool’d with hope, men favour the deceit;\r\n    Trust on, and think to-morrow will repay.\r\n    To-morrow’s falser than the former day;\r\n    Lies worse, and while it says we shall be blest\r\n    With some new joys, cuts off what we possest.\r\n    Strange cozenage!...”\r\n\r\n\r\nare as fine as any eight lines in Lucretius. Told him of an excellent\r\nremark of —— on this, that Dryden’s passage wholly lacks the mystery and\r\ngreat superhuman air of Lucretius. Mr. G. warmly agreed.\r\n\r\nHe regards it as a remarkable sign of the closeness of the church of\r\nEngland to the roots of life and feeling in the country, that so many\r\nclergymen should have written so much good poetry. Who, for instance? I\r\nasked. He named Heber, Moultrie, Newman (_Dream of Gerontius_), and Faber\r\nin at least one good poem, “The poor Labourer” (or some such title),\r\nCharles Tennyson. I doubt if this thesis has much body in it. He was for\r\nShelley as the most musical of all our poets. I told him that I had once\r\nasked M. to get Tennyson to write an autograph line for a friend of mine,\r\nand Tennyson had sent this:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Coldly on the dead volcano sleeps the gleam of dying day.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I suppose the poet must think well of it himself. ’Tis (M173) from the\r\nsecond _Locksley Hall_, and describes a man after passions have gone cool.\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—Yes, in melody, in the picturesque, and as apt simile, a fine\r\nline.\r\n\r\nHad been trying his hand at a translation of his favourite lines of\r\nPenelope about Odysseus. Said that, of course, you could translate similes\r\nand set passages, but to translate Homer as a whole, impossible. He was\r\ninclined, when all is said, to think Scott the nearest approach to a\r\nmodel.\r\n\r\n_Monday, Jan. 4._—At luncheon, Mr. Gladstone recalled the well-known story\r\nof Talleyrand on the death of Napoleon. The news was brought when T.\r\nchanced to be dining with Wellington. “Quel événement!” they all cried.\r\n“Non, ce n’est pas un événement,” said Talleyrand, “c’est une\r\nnouvelle”—’Tis no event, ’tis a piece of news. “Imagine such a way,” said\r\nMr. G., “of taking the disappearance of that colossal man! Compare it with\r\nthe opening of Manzoni’s ode, which makes the whole earth stand still. Yet\r\nboth points of view are right. In one sense, the giant’s death was only\r\nnews; in another, when we think of his history, it was enough to shake the\r\nworld.” At the moment, he could not recall Manzoni’s words, but at dinner\r\nhe told me that he had succeeded in piecing them together, and after\r\ndinner he went to his room and wrote them down for me on a piece of paper.\r\nCuriously enough, he could not recall the passage in his own splendid\r\ntranslation.(295)\r\n\r\nTalk about handsome men of the past; Sidney Herbert one of the handsomest\r\nand most attractive. But the Duke of Hamilton bore away the palm, as\r\nglorious as a Greek god. “One day in Rotten Row, I said this to the\r\nDuchess of C. She set up James Hope-Scott against my Duke. No doubt he had\r\nan intellectual element which the Duke lacked.” Then we discussed the\r\nbest-looking man in the H. of C. to-day....\r\n\r\n_Duke of Wellington._—Somebody was expatiating on the incomparable\r\nposition of the Duke; his popularity with kings, with nobles, with common\r\npeople. Mr. G. remembered that immediately after the formation of\r\nCanning’s government in 1827, when it was generally thought that he had\r\nbeen most unfairly and factiously treated (as Mr. G. still thinks, always\r\nsaving Peel) by the Duke and his friends, the Duke made an expedition to\r\nthe north of England, and had an overwhelming reception. Of course, he was\r\nthen only twelve years from Waterloo, and yet only four or five years\r\nlater he had to put up his iron shutters.\r\n\r\nApproved a remark that a friend of ours was not simple enough, not ready\r\nenough to take things as they come.\r\n\r\n_Mr. G._—Unless a man has a considerable gift for taking things as they\r\ncome, he may make up his mind that political life will be sheer torment to\r\nhim. He must meet fortune in all its moods.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, Jan. 5._—After dinner to-day, Mr. G. extraordinarily gay. He had\r\nbought a present of silver for his wife. She tried to guess the price, and\r\nafter the manner of wives in such a case, put the figure provokingly low.\r\nMr. G. then put on the deprecating air of the tradesman with wounded\r\nfeelings—and it was as capital fun as we could desire. That over, he fell\r\nto his backgammon with our host.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, Jan. 6._—Mrs. Gladstone eighty to-day! What a marvel....\r\n\r\nLéon Say called to see Mr. G. Long and most interesting conversation about\r\nall sorts of aspects of French politics, the concordat, the schools, and\r\nall the rest of it.\r\n\r\nHe illustrated the ignorance of French peasantry as to current affairs.\r\nThiers, long after he had become famous, went on a visit to his native\r\nregion; and there met a friend of his youth. “Eh bien,” said his friend,\r\n“tu as fait ton chemin.” “Mais oui, j’ai fait un peu mon chemin. J’ai été\r\nministre même.” “Ah, tiens! je ne savais pas que tu étais protestant.”\r\n\r\nI am constantly struck by his solicitude for the well-being and right\r\ndoing of Oxford and Cambridge—“the two eyes of the country.” This\r\nconnection between the higher education and the general movement of the\r\nnational mind engages his profound attention, and no doubt deserves such\r\nattention (M174) in any statesman who looks beyond the mere surface\r\nproblems of the day. To perceive the bearings of such matters as these,\r\nmakes Mr. G. a statesman of the highest class, as distinguished from men\r\nof clever expedients.\r\n\r\nMr. G. had been reading the Greek epigrams on religion in Mackail; quoted\r\nthe last of them as illustrating the description of the dead as the\r\ninhabitants of the more populous world:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    τῶν ἄπο κὴν ζωοῖσιν ἀκηδέα, κευτ᾽ ἄν ἵκηαι\r\n    ὲς πλεόνων, ἕξεις θυμὸν ἐλαφρότερον.(296)\r\n\r\n\r\nA more impressive epigram contains the same thought, where the old man,\r\nleaning on his staff, likens himself to the withered vine on its dry pole,\r\nand goes on to ask himself what advantage it would be to warm himself for\r\nthree or four more years in the sun; and on that reflection without\r\nheroics put off his life, and changed his home to the greater company,\r\n\r\n\r\n    κὴς πλεόνων ἦλθε μετοικεσίην.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the rest of the evening he kept us alive by a stock of infinite\r\ndrolleries. A scene of a dish of over-boiled tea at West Calder after a\r\nmeeting, would have made the fortune of a comedian.\r\n\r\nI said that in the all-important quality of co-operation, —— was only good\r\non condition of being in front. Mr. G. read him in the same sense.\r\nReminded of a mare he once had—admirable, provided you kept off spur,\r\ncurb, or whip; show her one of these things, and she would do nothing. Mr.\r\nG. more of a judge of men than is commonly thought.\r\n\r\nTold us of a Chinese despatch which came under his notice when he was at\r\nthe board of trade, and gave him food for reflection. A ship laden with\r\ngrain came to Canton. The administrator wrote to the central government at\r\nPekin to know whether the ship was to pay duty and land its cargo. The\r\nanswer was to the effect that the central government of the Flowery Land\r\nwas quite indifferent as a rule to the goings and comings of the\r\nBarbarians; whether they brought a cargo or brought no cargo was a thing\r\nof supreme unconcern. “But this cargo, you say, is food for the people.\r\nThere ought to be no obstacle to the entry of food for the people. So let\r\nit in. Your Younger Brother commends himself to you, etc. etc.”\r\n\r\n_Friday, Jan. 8._—A quiet evening. We were all rather piano at the end of\r\nan episode which had been thoroughly delightful. When Mr. G. bade me\r\ngood-night, he said with real feeling, “More sorry than I can say that\r\nthis is our last evening together at Biarritz.” He is painfully grieved to\r\nlose the sound of the sea in his ears.\r\n\r\n_Saturday, Jan. 9._—Strolled about all the forenoon. “What a time of\r\nblessed composure it has been,” said Mr. G. with a heavy sigh. The distant\r\nhills covered with snow, and the voice of the storm gradually swelling.\r\nStill the savage fury of the sea was yet some hours off, so we had to\r\nleave Biarritz without the spectacle of Atlantic rage at its fiercest.\r\n\r\nFound comfortable saloon awaiting us at Bayonne, and so under weeping\r\nskies we made our way to Pau. The landscape must be pretty, weather\r\npermitting. As it was, we saw but little. Mr. G. dozed and read Max\r\nMüller’s book on Anthropological Religions.\r\n\r\nArrived at Pau towards 5.30; drenching rain: nothing to be seen.\r\n\r\nAt tea time, a good little discussion raised by a protest against Dante\r\nbeing praised for a complete survey of human nature and the many phases of\r\nhuman lot. Intensity he has, but insight over the whole field of character\r\nand life? Mr. G. did not make any stand against this, and made the curious\r\nadmission that Dante was too optimist to be placed on a level with\r\nShakespeare, or even with Homer.\r\n\r\nThen we turned to lighter themes. He had once said to Henry Taylor, “I\r\nshould have thought he was the sort of man to have a good strong grasp of\r\na subject,” speaking of Lord Grey, who had been one of Taylor’s many\r\nchiefs at the Colonial Office. “I should have thought,” replied Taylor\r\nslowly and with a dreamy look, “he was the sort of man to have a good\r\nstrong _nip_ of a subject.” Witty, and very applicable to many men.\r\n\r\nWordsworth once gave Mr. G. with much complacency, as an example of his\r\nown readiness and resource, this story. A man came up to him at Rydal and\r\nsaid, “Do you happen to have seen my wife.” “Why,” replied the Sage, “I\r\ndid not know you had a wife!” This peculiarly modest attempt at pointed\r\nrepartee much tickled Mr. G., as well it might.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, Jan. 12._—Mr. G. completely recovered from two days of\r\nindisposition. We had about an hour’s talk on things in general, including\r\npolicy in the approaching session. He did not expect a dissolution, at the\r\nsame time a dissolution would not surprise him.\r\n\r\nAt noon they started for Périgord and Carcassonne, Nismes, Arles, and so\r\non to the Riviera full of kind things at our parting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII. The Fourth Administration. (1892-1894)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Τῷ δ᾽ ἤδη δύο μὲν γενεαὶ μερόπων ἀνθρώπων\r\n    ἐφθίαθ, οἷ οἱ πρόσθεν ἅμα τράφεν ἠδὲ γένοντο\r\n    ἐν Πύλῳ ἠγαθέῃ, μετὰ δὲ τριτάτοισιν ἄνασσεν.\r\n\r\n    _Iliad_, i. 250.\r\n\r\n    Two generations of mortal men had he already seen pass away, who\r\n    with him of old had been born and bred in sacred Pylos, and among\r\n    the third generation he held rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1892 the general election came, after a session that was not very long\r\nnor at all remarkable. Everybody knew that we should soon be dismissed,\r\nand everybody knew that the liberals would have a majority, but the size\r\nof it was beyond prognostication. Mr. Gladstone did not talk much about\r\nit, but in fact he reckoned on winning by eighty or a hundred. A leading\r\nliberal-unionist at whose table we met (May 24) gave us forty. That\r\nafternoon by the way the House had heard a speech of great power and\r\nsplendour. An Irish tory peer in the gallery said afterwards, “That old\r\nhero of yours is a miracle. When he set off in that high pitch, I said\r\nthat won’t last. Yet he kept it up all through as grand as ever, and came\r\nin fresher and stronger than when he began.” His sight failed him in\r\nreading an extract, and he asked me to read it for him, so he sat down\r\namid sympathetic cheers while it was read out from the box.\r\n\r\nAfter listening to a strong and undaunted reply from Mr. Balfour, he asked\r\nme to go with him into the tea-room; he was fresh, unperturbed, and in\r\nhigh spirits. He told me he had once sat at table with Lord Melbourne, but\r\nregretted that he had never known him. Said that of the sixty men or so\r\nwho had been his colleagues in cabinet, the (M175) very easiest and most\r\nattractive was Clarendon. Constantly regretted that he had never met nor\r\nknown Sir Walter Scott, as of course he might have done. Thought the\r\neffect of diplomacy to be bad on the character; to train yourself to\r\npractise the airs of genial friendship towards men from whom you are doing\r\nyour best to hide yourself, and out of whom you are striving to worm that\r\nwhich they wish to conceal. Said that he was often asked for advice by\r\nyoung men as to objects of study. He bade them study and ponder, first,\r\nthe history and working of freedom in America; second, the history of\r\nabsolutism in France from Louis XIV. to the Revolution. It was suggested\r\nthat if the great thing with the young is to attract them to fine types of\r\ncharacter, the Huguenots had some grave, free, heroic figures, and in the\r\neighteenth century Turgot was the one inspiring example: when Mill was in\r\nlow spirits, he restored himself by Condorcet’s life of Turgot. This\r\nreminded him that Canning had once praised Turgot in the House of Commons,\r\nthough most likely nobody but himself knew anything at all about Turgot.\r\nTalking of the great centuries, the thirteenth, and the sixteenth, and the\r\nseventeenth, Mr. Gladstone let drop what for him seems the remarkable\r\njudgment that “Man as a type has not improved since those great times; he\r\nis not so big, so grand, so heroic as he has been.” This, the reader will\r\nagree, demands a good deal of consideration.\r\n\r\nThen he began to talk about offices, in view of what were now pretty\r\nobvious possibilities. After discussing more important people, he asked\r\nwhether, after a recent conversation, I had thought more of my own office,\r\nand I told him that I fancied like Regulus I had better go back to the\r\nIrish department. “Yes,” he answered with a flash of his eye, “I think so.\r\nThe truth is that we’re both chained to the oar; I am chained to the oar;\r\nyou are chained.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe electoral period, when it arrived, he passed once more at Dalmeny. In\r\na conversation the morning after I was allowed to join him there, he\r\nseemed already to have a grand majority of three figures, to have kissed\r\nhands, and to be installed in Downing Street. This confidence was\r\nindispensable to him. At the end of his talk he went up to prepare some\r\nnotes for the speech that he was to make in the afternoon at Glasgow. Just\r\nbefore the carriage came to take him to the train, I heard him calling\r\nfrom the library. In I went, and found him hurriedly thumbing the leaves\r\nof a Horace. “Tell me,” he cried, “can you put your finger on the passage\r\nabout Castor and Pollux? I’ve just thought of something; Castor and Pollux\r\nwill finish my speech at Glasgow.” “Isn’t it in the Third Book?” said I.\r\n“No, no; I’m pretty sure it is in the First Book”—busily turning over the\r\npages. “Ah, here it is,” and then he read out the noble lines with\r\nanimated modulation, shut the book with a bang, and rushed off exultant to\r\nthe carriage. This became one of the finest of his perorations.(297) His\r\ndelivery of it that afternoon, they said, was most majestic—the picture of\r\nthe wreck, and then the calm that gradually brought down the towering\r\nbillows to the surface of the deep, entrancing the audience like magic.\r\n\r\nThen came a depressing week. The polls flowed in, all day long, day after\r\nday. The illusory hopes of many months faded into night. The three-figure\r\nmajority by the end of the week had vanished so completely, that one\r\nwondered how it could ever have been thought of. On July 13 his own\r\nMidlothian poll was declared, and instead of his old majority of 4000, or\r\nthe 3000 on which he counted, he was only in by 690. His chagrin was\r\nundoubtedly intense, for he had put forth every atom of his strength in\r\nthe campaign. But with that splendid suppression of vexation which is one\r\nof the good lessons that men learn in public life, he put a brave face on\r\nit, was perfectly cheery all through the luncheon, and afterwards took me\r\nto the music-room, where instead of constructing a triumphant cabinet with\r\na majority of a hundred, he had to try to adjust an Irish policy to a\r\nparliament with hardly a majority at all. These topics exhausted, with a\r\ncuriously quiet gravity of tone he told me (M176) that cataract had formed\r\nover one eye, that its sight was gone, and that in the other eye he was\r\ninfested with a white speck. “One white speck,” he said, almost laughing,\r\n“I can do with, but if the one becomes many, it will be a bad business.\r\nThey tell me that perhaps the fresh air of Braemar will do me good.” To\r\nBraemar the ever loyal Mr. Armitstead piloted them, in company with Lord\r\nActon of whose society Mr. Gladstone could never have too much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been made a matter of blame by friends no less than foes,\r\nthat he should have undertaken the task of government, depending on a\r\nmajority not large enough to coerce the House of Lords. One or two short\r\nobservations on this would seem to be enough. How could he refuse to try\r\nto work his Irish policy through parliament, after the bulk of the Irish\r\nmembers had quitted their own leader four years before in absolute\r\nreliance on the sincerity and good faith of Mr. Gladstone and his party?\r\nAfter all the confidence that Ireland had shown in him at the end of 1890,\r\nhow could he in honour throw up the attempt that had been the only object\r\nof his public life since 1886? To do this would have been to justify\r\nindeed the embittered warnings of Mr. Parnell in his most reckless hour.\r\nHow could either refusal of office or the postponement of an Irish bill\r\nafter taking office, be made intelligible in Ireland itself? Again, the\r\npath of honour in Ireland was equally the path of honour and of safety in\r\nGreat Britain. Were British liberals, who had given him a majority, partly\r\nfrom disgust at Irish coercion, partly from faith that he could produce a\r\nworking plan of Irish government, and partly from hopes of reforms of\r\ntheir own—were they to learn that their leaders could do nothing for any\r\nof their special objects?\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone found some consolation in a precedent. In 1835, he argued,\r\n“the Melbourne government came in with a British minority, swelled into a\r\nmajority hardly touching thirty by the O’Connell contingent of forty. And\r\nthey staid in for six years and a half, the longest lived government since\r\nLord Liverpool’s.(298) But the Irish were under the command of a master;\r\nand Ireland, scarcely beginning her political life, had to be content with\r\nsmall mercies. Lastly, that government was rather slack, and on this\r\nground perhaps could not well be taken as a pattern.” In the present case,\r\nthe attitude of the Parnellite group who continued the schism that began\r\nin the events of the winter of 1890, was not likely to prove a grave\r\ndifficulty in parliament, and in fact it did not. The mischief here was in\r\nthe effect of Irish feuds upon public opinion in the country. As Mr.\r\nGladstone put it in the course of a letter that he had occasion to write\r\nto me (November 26, 1892):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Until the schism arose, we had every prospect of a majority\r\n    approaching those of 1868 and 1880. With the death of Mr. Parnell\r\n    it was supposed that it must perforce close. But this expectation\r\n    has been disappointed. The existence and working of it have to no\r\n    small extent puzzled and bewildered the English people. They\r\n    cannot comprehend how a quarrel, to them utterly unintelligible\r\n    (some even think it discreditable), should be allowed to divide\r\n    the host in the face of the enemy; and their unity and zeal have\r\n    been deadened in proportion. Herein we see the main cause why our\r\n    majority is not more than double what it actually numbers, and the\r\n    difference between these two scales of majority represents, as I\r\n    apprehend, the difference between power to carry the bill as the\r\n    Church and Land bills were carried into law, and the default of\r\n    such power. The main mischief has already been done; but it\r\n    receives additional confirmation with the lapse of every week or\r\n    month.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn forming his fourth administration Mr. Gladstone found one or two\r\nobstacles on which he had not reckoned, and perhaps could not have been\r\nexpected to reckon. By that forbearance of which he was a master, they\r\nwere in good time surmounted. New men, of a promise soon amply fulfilled,\r\nwere taken in, including, to Mr. Gladstone’s own particular satisfaction,\r\nthe son of the oldest (M177) of all the surviving friends of his youth,\r\nSir Thomas Acland.(299)\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone remained as head of the government for a year and a few\r\nmonths (Aug. 1892 to March 3, 1894). In that time several decisions of\r\npith and moment were taken, one measure of high importance became law,\r\noperations began against the Welsh establishment, but far the most\r\nconspicuous biographic element of this short period was his own\r\nincomparable display of power of every kind in carrying the new bill for\r\nthe better government of Ireland through the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nIn foreign affairs it was impossible that he should forget the case of\r\nEgypt. Lord Salisbury in 1887 had pressed forward an arrangement by which\r\nthe British occupation was under definite conditions and at a definite\r\ndate to come to an end. If this convention had been accepted by the\r\nSultan, the British troops would probably have been home by the time of\r\nthe change of government in this country. French diplomacy, however, at\r\nConstantinople, working as it might seem against its own professed aims,\r\nhindered the ratification of the convention, and Lord Salisbury’s policy\r\nwas frustrated. Negotiations did not entirely drop, and they had not\r\npassed out of existence when Lord Salisbury resigned. In the autumn of\r\n1892 the French ambassador addressed a friendly inquiry to the new\r\ngovernment as to the reception likely to be given to overtures for\r\nre-opening the negotiations. The answer was that if France had suggestions\r\nto offer, they would be received in the same friendly spirit in which they\r\nwere tendered. When any communications were received, Mr. Gladstone said\r\nin the House of Commons, there would be no indisposition on our part to\r\nextend to them our friendly consideration. Of all this nothing came. A\r\nrather serious ministerial crisis in Egypt in January 1893, followed by a\r\nministerial crisis in Paris in April, arrested whatever projects of\r\nnegotiation France may have entertained.(300)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIn December (1892), at Hawarden, Mr. Gladstone said to me one day after we\r\nhad been working for five or six hours at the heads of the new Home Rule\r\nbill, that his general health was good and sound, but his sight and his\r\nhearing were so rapidly declining, that he thought he might almost any day\r\nhave to retire from office. It was no moment for banal deprecation. He sat\r\nsilently pondering this vision in his own mind, of coming fate. It seemed\r\nlike Tennyson’s famous simile—\r\n\r\n\r\n    So dark a forethought rolled about his brain,\r\n    As on a dull day in an ocean cave\r\n    The blind wave feeling round his long sea-hall\r\n    In silence.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would have been preternatural if he had shown the same overwhelming\r\ninterest that had animated him when the Irish policy was fresh in 1886.\r\nYet the instinct of a strong mind and the lifelong habit of ardent\r\nindustry carried him through his Sisyphean toil. The routine business of\r\nhead of a government he attended to, with all his usual assiduity, and in\r\ncabinet he was clear, careful, methodical, as always.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the bill was carefully and elaborately worked by Mr.\r\nGladstone through an excellent committee (M178) of the cabinet.(301) Here\r\nhe was acute, adroit, patient, full of device, expedient, and the art of\r\nconstruction; now and then vehement and bearing down like a three-decker\r\nupon craft of more modest tonnage. But the vehemence was rare, and here as\r\neverywhere else he was eager to do justice to all the points and arguments\r\nof other people. He sought opportunities of deliberation in order to\r\ndeliberate, and not under that excellent name to cultivate the art of the\r\nharangue, or to overwork secondary points, least of all to treat the many\r\nas made for one. That is to say, he went into counsel for the sake of\r\ncounsel, and not to cajole, or bully, or insist on his own way because it\r\nwas his own way. In the high article of finance, he would wrestle like a\r\ntiger. It was an intricate and difficult business by the necessity of the\r\ncase, and among the aggravations of it was the discovery at one point that\r\na wrong figure had been furnished to him by some department. He declared\r\nthis truly heinous crime to be without a precedent in his huge experience.\r\n\r\nThe crucial difficulty was the Irish representation at Westminster. In the\r\nfirst bill of 1886, the Irish members were to come no more to the imperial\r\nparliament, except for one or two special purposes. The two alternatives\r\nto the policy of exclusion were either inclusion of the Irish members for\r\nall purposes, or else their inclusion for imperial purposes only. In his\r\nspeech at Swansea in 1887, Mr. Gladstone favoured provisional inclusion,\r\nwithout prejudice to a return to the earlier plan of exclusion if that\r\nshould be recommended by subsequent experience.(302) In the bill now\r\nintroduced (Feb. 13, 1893), eighty representatives from Ireland were to\r\nhave seats at Westminster, but they were not to vote upon motions or bills\r\nexpressly confined to England or Scotland, and there were other\r\nlimitations. This plan was soon found to be wholly intolerable to the\r\nHouse of Commons. Exclusion having failed, and inclusion of reduced\r\nnumbers for limited purposes having failed, the only course left open was\r\nwhat was called _omnes omnia_, or rather the inclusion of eighty Irish\r\nmembers, with power of voting on all purposes.\r\n\r\nEach of the three courses was open to at least one single, but very\r\ndirect, objection. Exclusion, along with the exaction of revenue from\r\nIreland by the parliament at Westminster, was taxation without\r\nrepresentation. Inclusion for all purposes was to allow the Irish to\r\nmeddle in our affairs, while we were no longer to meddle in theirs.\r\nInclusion for limited purposes still left them invested with the power of\r\nturning out a British government by a vote against it on an imperial\r\nquestion. Each plan, therefore, ended in a paradox. There was a fourth\r\nparadox, namely, that whenever the British supporters of a government did\r\nnot suffice to build up a decisive majority, then the Irish vote\r\ndescending into one or other scale of the parliamentary balance might\r\ndecide who should be our rulers. This paradox—the most glaring of them\r\nall—habit and custom have made familiar, and familiarity might almost seem\r\nto have actually endeared it to us. In 1893 Mr. Gladstone and his\r\ncolleagues thought themselves compelled to change clause 9 of the new\r\nbill, just as they had thought themselves forced to drop clause 24 of the\r\nold bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Gladstone’s performances in the days of committee on the bill,\r\nthat stirred the wonder and admiration of the House. If he had been fifty\r\nthey would have been astonishing; at eighty-four they were indeed a\r\nmarvel. He made speeches of powerful argument, of high constitutional\r\nreasoning, of trenchant debating force. No emergency arose for which he\r\nwas not ready, no demand that his versatility was not adequate to meet.\r\nHis energy never flagged. When the bill came on, he would put on his\r\nglasses, pick up the paper of amendments, and running through them like\r\nlightning, would say, “Of course, that’s absurd—that will never do—we can\r\nnever accept that—is there any harm in this?” Too many concessions made on\r\nthe spur of the (M179) moment to the unionists stirred resentment in the\r\nnationalists, and once or twice they exploded. These rapid splendours of\r\nhis had their perils. I pointed out to him the pretty obvious drawbacks of\r\nsettling delicate questions as we went along with no chance of sounding\r\nthe Irishmen, and asked him to spare me quarter of an hour before\r\nluncheon, when the draftsman and I, having threshed out the amendments of\r\nthe day, could put the bare points for his consideration. He was horrified\r\nat the very thought. “Out of the question. Do you want to kill me? I must\r\nhave the whole of the morning for general government business. Don’t ask\r\nme.”(303)\r\n\r\nObstruction was freely practised and without remorse. The chief fighting\r\ndebater against the government made a long second-reading speech, on the\r\nmotion that the clause stand part of the bill. A little before eight\r\no’clock when the fighting debater was winding up, Mr. Gladstone was\r\nundecided about speaking. “What do you advise?” he asked of a friend. “I\r\nam afraid it will take too much out of you,” the friend replied; “but\r\nstill, speak for twenty minutes and no more.” Up he rose, and for half an\r\nhour a delighted House was treated to one of the most remarkable\r\nperformances that ever was known. “I have never seen Mr. Gladstone,” says\r\none observer, “so dramatic, so prolific of all the resources of the\r\nactor’s art. The courage, the audacity, and the melodrama of it were\r\nirresistible” (May 11).\r\n\r\n\r\n    For ten minutes, writes another chronicler, Mr. Gladstone spoke,\r\n    holding his audience spell-bound by his force. Then came a sudden\r\n    change, and it seemed that he was about to collapse from sheer\r\n    physical exhaustion. His voice failed, huskiness and\r\n    indistinctness took the place of clearness and lucidity. Then\r\n    pulling himself together for a great effort, Mr. Gladstone\r\n    pointing the deprecatory finger at Mr. Chamberlain, warned the\r\n    Irishmen to beware of him; to watch the fowler who would inveigle\r\n    them in his snare. Loud and long rang the liberal cheers. In plain\r\n    words he told the unionists that Mr. Chamberlain’s purpose was\r\n    none other than obstruction, and he conveyed the intimation with a\r\n    delicate expressiveness, a superabundant good feeling, a dramatic\r\n    action and a marvellous music of voice that conspired in their\r\n    various qualities to produce a _tour de force_. By sheer strength\r\n    of enthusiasm and an overflowing wealth of eloquence, Mr.\r\n    Gladstone literally conquered every physical weakness and secured\r\n    an effect electric in its influence even on seasoned “old hands.”\r\n    Amidst high excitement and the sound of cheering that promised\r\n    never to die away the House gradually melted into the lobbies. Mr.\r\n    Gladstone, exhausted with his effort, chatted to Mr. Morley on the\r\n    treasury bench. Except for these two the government side was\r\n    deserted, and the conservatives had already disappeared. The\r\n    nationalists sat shoulder to shoulder, a solid phalanx. They eyed\r\n    the prime minister with eager intent, and as soon as the venerable\r\n    statesman rose to walk out of the House, they sprang to their feet\r\n    and rent the air with wild hurrahs.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo wonder if the talk downstairs at dinner among his colleagues that\r\nnight, all turned upon their chief, his art and power, his union of the\r\nhighest qualities of brain and heart with extraordinary practical\r\npenetration, and close watchfulness of incident and trait and personality,\r\ndisclosed in many a racy aside and pungent sally. The orator was fatigued,\r\nbut full of keen enjoyment. This was one of the three or four occasions\r\nwhen he was induced not to return to the House after dinner. It had always\r\nbeen his habit in taking charge of bills to work the ship himself. No\r\nwonder that he held to this habit in this case.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion ministers had taken ground that, as the debate went\r\non, everybody saw they could not hold. An official spokesman for the bill\r\nhad expressed an opinion, or intention, that, as very speedily appeared,\r\nIrish opposition would not allow to be maintained. There was no great\r\nsubstance in the point, but even a small dose of humiliation will make a\r\nparliamentary dish as bitter to one side as it is savoury to the other.\r\nThe opposition grew more and more radiant, as it grew more certain that\r\nthe official spokesman (M180) must be thrown over. The discomfiture of the\r\nministerialists at the prospect of the public mortification of their\r\nleaders was extreme in the same degree. “I suppose we must give it up,”\r\nsaid Mr. Gladstone. This was clear; and when he rose, he was greeted with\r\nmocking cheers from the enemy, though the enemy’s chief men who had long\r\nexperience of his Protean resources were less confident. Beginning in a\r\ntone of easy gravity and candour, he went on to points of pleasant banter,\r\ngot his audience interested and amused and a little bewildered; carried\r\nmen with him in graceful arguments on the merits; and finally, with\r\nbye-play of consummate sport, showed in triumph that the concession that\r\nwe consented to make was so right and natural, that it must have been\r\ninevitable from the very first. Never were tables more effectively turned;\r\nthe opposition watched first with amazement, then with excitement and\r\ndelight as children watch a wizard; and he sat down victorious. Not\r\nanother word was said or could be said. “Never in all my parliamentary\r\nyears,” said a powerful veteran on the front bench opposite, as he passed\r\nbehind the Speaker’s chair, “never have I seen so wonderful a thing done\r\nas that.”\r\n\r\nThe state of the county of Clare was a godsend to the obstructive. Clare\r\nwas not at that moment quite as innocent as the garden of Eden before the\r\nfall, but the condition was not serious; it had been twenty times worse\r\nbefore without occupying the House of Commons five minutes. Now an evening\r\na week was not thought too much for a hollow debate on disorder in Clare.\r\nIt was described as a definite matter of urgent importance, though it had\r\nslept for years, and though three times in succession the judge of assize\r\n(travelling entirely out of his proper business) had denounced the state\r\nof things. It was made to support five votes of censure in eight weeks.\r\n\r\nOn one of these votes of censure on Irish administration, moved by Mr.\r\nBalfour (March 27), Mr. Gladstone listened to the debate. At 8 we begged\r\nhim not to stay and not to take the trouble to speak, so trumpery was the\r\nwhole affair. He said he must, if only for five minutes, to show that he\r\nidentified himself with his Irish minister. He left to dine, and then\r\nbefore ten was on his feet, making what Lord Randolph Churchill rightly\r\ncalled “a most impressive and entrancing speech.” He talked of Pat this\r\nand Michael that, and Father the other, as if he had pondered their cases\r\nfor a month, clenching every point with extraordinary strength as well as\r\nconsummate ease and grace, and winding up with some phrases of wonderful\r\nsimplicity and concentration.\r\n\r\nA distinguished member made a motion for the exclusion of Irish cabinet\r\nministers from their chamber. Mr. Gladstone was reminded on the bench just\r\nbefore he rose, that the same proposal had been inserted in the Act of\r\nSettlement, and repealed in 1705. He wove this into his speech with a\r\nskill, and amplified confidence, that must have made everybody suppose\r\nthat it was a historic fact present every day to his mind. The attention\r\nof a law-officer sitting by was called to this rapid amplification. “I\r\nnever saw anything like it in all my whole life,” said the law-officer;\r\nand he was a man who had been accustomed to deal with some of the\r\nstrongest and quickest minds of the day as judges and advocates.\r\n\r\nOne day when a tremendous afternoon of obstruction had almost worn him\r\ndown, the adjournment came at seven o’clock. He was haggard and depressed.\r\nOn returning at ten we found him making a most lively and amusing speech\r\nupon procedure. He sat down as blithe as dawn. “To make a speech of that\r\nsort,” he said in deprecation of compliment, “a man does best to dine out;\r\n’tis no use to lie on a sofa and think about it.”\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly Mr. Gladstone’s method in this long committee carried with it\r\nsome disadvantages. His discursive treatment exposed an enormous surface.\r\nHis abundance of illustration multiplied points for debate. His fertility\r\nin improvised arguments encouraged improvisation in disputants without the\r\ngift. Mr. Gladstone always supposed that a great theme needs to be\r\ncopiously handled, which is perhaps doubtful, and indeed is often an exact\r\ninversion of the true state of things. However that may be, copiousness is\r\na game at which two can play, as a patriotic opposition now and at other\r\ntimes has effectually disclosed. Some thought in these days that a man\r\nlike Lord Althorp, for (M181) instance, would have given the obstructives\r\nmuch more trouble in their pursuits than did Mr. Gladstone.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Gladstone’s supporters should become restive at the slow motion\r\nof business was natural enough. They came to ministers, calling out for a\r\ndrastic closure, as simple tribes might clamour to a rain-maker. It was\r\nthe end of June, and with a reasonable opposition conducted in decent good\r\nfaith, it was computed that the bill might be through committee in\r\nnineteen days. But the hypothesis of reason and good faith was not thought\r\nto be substantial, and the cabinet resolved on resort to closure on a\r\nscale like that on which it had been used by the late government in the\r\ncase of the Crimes Act of 1887, and of the Special Commission. It has been\r\nsaid since on excellent authority, that without speaking of their good\r\nfaith, Mr. Gladstone’s principal opponents were now running absolutely\r\nshort of new ammunition, and having used the same arguments and made the\r\nsame speeches for so many weeks, they were so worn out that the guillotine\r\nwas superfluous. Of these straits, however, there was little evidence. Mr.\r\nGladstone entered into the operation with a good deal of chagrin. He saw\r\nthat the House of Commons in which he did his work and rose to glory was\r\nswiftly fading out of sight, and a new institution of different habits of\r\nresponsibility and practice taking its place.\r\n\r\nThe stage of committee lasted for sixty-three sittings. The whole\r\nproceedings occupied eighty-two. It is not necessary to hold that the time\r\nwas too long for the size of the task, if it had been well spent. The\r\nspirit of the debate was aptly illustrated by the plea of a brilliant\r\ntory, that he voted for a certain motion against a principle that he\r\napproved, because he thought the carrying of the motion “would make the\r\nbill more detestable.” Opposition rested on a view of Irish character and\r\nIrish feeling about England, that can hardly have been very deeply thought\r\nout, because ten years later the most bitter opponents of the Irish claim\r\nlaunched a policy, that was to make Irish peasants direct debtors to the\r\nhated England to the tune of one hundred million pounds, and was to\r\ndislodge by imperial cash those who were persistently called the only\r\nfriends of the imperial connection. The bill passed its second reading by\r\n347 against 304, or a majority of 43. In some critical divisions, the\r\nmajority ran down to 27. The third reading was carried by 301 against 267,\r\nor a majority of 34. It was estimated that excluding the Irish, there was\r\na majority against the bill of 23. If we counted England and Wales alone,\r\nthe adverse majority was 48. When it reached them, the Lords incontinently\r\nthrew it out. The roll of the Lords held 560 names, beyond the peers of\r\nthe royal house. Of this body of 560, no fewer than 419 voted against the\r\nbill, and only 41 voted for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe session was protracted until it became the longest in the history of\r\nparliament. The House was sitting when Mr. Gladstone’s eighty-fourth\r\nbirthday arrived. “Before putting a question,” said Mr. Balfour in a tone\r\nthat, after the heat and exasperations of so many months, was refreshing\r\nto hear, “perhaps the right honourable gentleman will allow me, on my own\r\npart and on that of my friends, to offer him our most sincere\r\ncongratulations.” “Allow me to thank him,” said Mr. Gladstone, “for his\r\ngreat courtesy and kindness.” The government pressed forward and carried\r\nthrough the House of Commons a measure dealing with the liability of\r\nemployers for accidents, and a more important measure setting up elective\r\nbodies for certain purposes in parishes. Into the first the Lords\r\nintroduced such changes as were taken to nullify all the advantages of the\r\nbill, and the cabinet approved of its abandonment. Into the second they\r\nforced back certain provisions that the Commons had with full deliberation\r\ndecisively rejected.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone was at Biarritz, he records, when this happened in January\r\nof 1894. He had gone there to recruit after the incomparable exertions of\r\nthe session, and also to consider at a cool distance and in changed scenes\r\nother topics that had for some weeks caused him some agitation. He now\r\nthought that there was a decisive case against the House of Lords. Apart\r\nfrom the Irish bill to which the (M182) Commons had given eighty-two days,\r\nthe Lords had maimed the bill for parish councils, to which had gone the\r\nlabour of forty-one days. Other bills they had mutilated or defeated. Upon\r\nthe whole, he argued, it was not too much to say that for practical\r\npurposes the Lords had destroyed the work of the House of Commons,\r\nunexampled as that work was in the time and pains bestowed upon it. “I\r\nsuggested dissolution to my colleagues in London, where half, or more than\r\nhalf, the cabinet were found at the moment. I received by telegraph a\r\nhopelessly adverse reply.” Reluctantly he let the idea drop, always\r\nmaintaining, however, that a signal opportunity had been lost. Even in my\r\nlast conversation with him in 1897, he held to his text that we ought to\r\nhave dissolved at this moment. The case, he said, was clear, thorough, and\r\ncomplete. As has been already mentioned, there were four occasions on\r\nwhich he believed that he had divined the right moment for a searching\r\nappeal to public opinion on a great question.(304) The renewal of the\r\nincome tax in 1853 was the first; the proposal of religious equality for\r\nIreland in 1868 was the second; home rule was the third, and here he was\r\njustified by the astonishing and real progress that he had made up to the\r\ncatastrophe at the end of 1890. The fourth case was this, of a dissolution\r\nupon the question of the relations of the two Houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII. Retirement From Public Life. (1894)\r\n\r\n\r\n    O, ’tis a burden, Cromwell, ’tis a burden\r\n    Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven.\r\n\r\n    _Henry VIII._ iii. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\n“Politics,” wrote Mr. Gladstone in one of his private memoranda in March\r\n1894, “are like a labyrinth, from the inner intricacies of which it is\r\neven more difficult to find the way of escape, than it was to find the way\r\ninto them. My age did something but not enough. The deterioration of my\r\nhearing helped, but insufficiently. It is the state of my sight which has\r\nsupplied me with effectual aid in exchanging my imperious public\r\nobligations for what seems to be a free place on ‘the breezy common of\r\nhumanity.’ And it has only been within the last eight months, or\r\nthereabouts, that the decay of working sight has advanced at such a pace\r\nas to present the likelihood of its becoming stringently operative at an\r\nearly date. It would have been very difficult to fix that date at this or\r\nthat precise point, without the appearance of making an arbitrary choice;\r\nbut then the closing of the parliamentary session (1893-4) offered a\r\nnatural break between the cessation and renewal of engagements, which was\r\nadmirably suited to the design. And yet I think it, if not certain, yet\r\nvery highly probable at the least, that any disposition of mine to profit\r\nby this break would—but for the naval scheme of my colleagues in the naval\r\nestimates—have been frustrated by their desire to avoid the inconveniences\r\nof a change, and by the pressure which they would have brought to bear\r\nupon me in consequence. The effect of that scheme was not to bring about\r\nthe construction of an artificial cause, or pretext rather, of\r\nresignation, but to compel me to act upon one that was rational,\r\nsufficient, and ready to hand.”\r\n\r\nThis is the short, plain, and intelligible truth as to what now happened.\r\nThere can be no reason to-day for not stating what was for a long time\r\nmatter of common surmise, if not of common knowledge, that Mr. Gladstone\r\ndid not regard the naval estimates, opened but not settled in December\r\n1893, as justified by the circumstances of the time. He made a speech that\r\nmonth in parliament in reply to a motion from the front bench opposite,\r\nand there he took a position undoubtedly antagonistic to the new scheme\r\nthat found favour with his cabinet, though not with all its members. The\r\npresent writer is of course not free to go into details, beyond those that\r\nanybody else not a member of the cabinet would discover from Mr.\r\nGladstone’s papers. Nor does the public lose anything of real interest by\r\nthis necessary reserve. Mr. Gladstone said he wished to make me “his\r\ndepositary” as things gradually moved on, and he wrote me a series of\r\nshort letters from day to day. If they could be read aloud in Westminster\r\nHall, no harm would be done either to surviving colleagues or to others;\r\nthey would furnish no new reason for thinking either better or worse of\r\nanybody; and no one with a decent sense of the value of time would concern\r\nhimself in all the minor detail of an ineffectual controversy. The central\r\nfacts were simple. Two things weighed with him, first his infirmities, and\r\nsecond his disapproval of the policy. How, he asked himself, could he turn\r\nhis back on his former self by becoming a party to swollen expenditure?\r\nTrue he had changed from conservative to liberal in general politics, but\r\nwhen he was conservative, that party was the economic party, “Peel its\r\nleader being a Cobdenite.” To assent to this new outlay in time of peace\r\nwas to revolutionise policy. Then he would go on—“Owing to the part which\r\nI was drawn to take, first in Italy, then as to Greece, then on the\r\neastern question, I have come to be considered not only an English but a\r\nEuropean statesman. My name stands in Europe as a symbol of the policy of\r\npeace, moderation, and non-aggression. What would be said of my active\r\nparticipation in a policy that will be taken as plunging England into the\r\nwhirlpool of militarism? Third, I have been in active public life for a\r\nperiod nearly as long as the time between the beginning of Mr. Pitt’s\r\nfirst ministry and the close of Sir Robert Peel’s; between 1783 and\r\n1846—sixty-two years and a half. During that time I have uniformly opposed\r\nmilitarism.” Thus he would put his case.\r\n\r\nAfter the naval estimates were brought forward, attempts were naturally\r\nmade at accommodation, for whether he availed himself of the end of the\r\nsession as a proper occasion of retirement or not, he was bound to try to\r\nget the estimates down if he could. He laboured hard at the task of\r\nconversion, and though some of his colleagues needed no conversion, with\r\nthe majority he did not prevail. He admitted that he had made limited\r\nconcessions to scares in 1860 and in 1884, and that he had besides been\r\nrepeatedly responsible for extraordinary financial provisions having\r\nreference to some crisis of the day:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I did this, (1) By a preliminary budget in 1854; (2) By the final\r\n    budget of July 1859; by the vote of credit in July 1870; and again\r\n    by the vote of credit in 1884. Every one of these was special, and\r\n    was shown in each case respectively to be special by the sequel:\r\n    no one of them had reference to the notion of establishing\r\n    dominant military or even naval power in Europe. Their amounts\r\n    were various, but were adapted to the view taken, at least by me,\r\n    of the exigency actually present.(305)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the House after so many months of toil was still labouring manfully\r\nupon English bills, two of them of no secondary importance, it was decided\r\nby his family and their advisers that Mr. Gladstone should again try the\r\neffects of Biarritz, and thither they went on January 13. Distance,\r\nhowever, could not efface from his mind all thought of the decision that\r\nthe end of the session would exact from him. (M183) Rumours began to fly\r\nabout in London that the prime minister upon his return intended to\r\nresign, and they were naturally clad with intrinsic probability. From\r\nBiarritz a communication was made to the press with his authority. It was\r\nto this effect, that the statement that Mr. Gladstone had definitely\r\ndecided, or had decided at all, on resigning office was untrue. It was\r\ntrue that for many months past his age and the condition of his sight and\r\nhearing had in his judgment made relief from public cares desirable, and\r\nthat accordingly his tenure of office had been at any moment liable to\r\ninterruption from these causes, in their nature permanent.\r\n\r\nNature meanwhile could not set back the shadow on the dial. On his coming\r\nback from Biarritz (February 10) neither eyes nor ears were better. How\r\nshould they be at eighty-five? The session was ending, the prorogation\r\nspeech was to be composed, and the time had come for that “natural break”\r\nbetween the cessation and renewal of his official obligations, of which we\r\nhave already heard him speak. His colleagues carried almost to importunity\r\ntheir appeals to him to stay; to postpone what one of them called, and\r\nmany of them truly felt to be, this “moment of anguish.” The division of\r\nopinion on estimates remained, but even if that could have been bridged,\r\nhis sight and hearing could not be made whole. The rational and sufficient\r\ncause of resignation, as he only too justly described it, was strong as\r\never. Whether if the cabinet had come to his view on estimates, he would\r\nin spite of his great age and infirmities have come to their view of the\r\nimportance of his remaining, we cannot tell. According to his wont, he\r\navoided decision until the time had come when decision was necessary, and\r\nthen he made up his mind, “without the appearance of an arbitrary choice,”\r\nthat the time had come for accepting the natural break, and quitting\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nOn Feb. 27, arriving in the evening at Euston from Ireland, I found a\r\nmessenger with a note from Mr. Gladstone begging me to call on my way\r\nhome. I found him busy as usual at his table in Downing Street. “I suppose\r\n’tis the long habit of a life,” he said cheerily, “but even in the midst\r\nof these passages, if ever I have half or quarter of an hour to spare, I\r\nfind myself turning to my Horace translation.” He said the prorogation\r\nspeech would be settled on Thursday; the Queen would consider it on\r\nFriday; the council would be held on Saturday, and on that evening or\r\nafternoon he should send in his letter of resignation.\r\n\r\nThe next day he had an audience at Buckingham Palace, and indirectly\r\nconveyed to the Queen what she might soon expect to learn from him. His\r\nrigorous sense of loyalty to colleagues made it improper and impossible to\r\nbring either before the Queen or the public his difference of judgment on\r\nmatters for which his colleagues, not he, would be responsible, and on\r\nwhich they, not he, would have to take action. He derived certain\r\nimpressions at his audience, he told me, one of them being that the\r\nSovereign would not seek his advice as to a successor.\r\n\r\nHe wrote to inform the Prince of Wales of the approaching event:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    In thus making it known to your royal Highness, he concluded, I\r\n    desire to convey, on my own and my wife’s part our fervent thanks\r\n    for the unbounded kindness which we have at all times received\r\n    from your royal Highness and not less from the beloved Princess of\r\n    Wales. The devotion of an old man is little worth; but if at any\r\n    time there be the smallest service which by information or\r\n    suggestion your royal Highness may believe me capable of\r\n    rendering, I shall remain as much at your command as if I had\r\n    continued to be an active and responsible servant of the Queen. I\r\n    remain with heartfelt loyalty and gratitude, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prince expressed his sincere regret, said how deeply the Princess and\r\nhe were touched by the kind words about them, and how greatly for a long\r\nnumber of years they had valued his friendship and that of Mrs. Gladstone.\r\nMr. Balfour, to whom he also confidentially told the news, communicated\r\namong other graceful words, “the special debt of gratitude that was due to\r\nhim for the immense public service he had performed in fostering and\r\nkeeping alive the great traditions of the House of Commons.” The day after\r\nthat (March 1) was his last cabinet council, and a painful day it (M184)\r\nwas. The business of the speech and other matters were discussed as usual,\r\nthen came the end. In his report to the Queen—his last—he said:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Looking forward to the likelihood that this might be the last\r\n    occasion on which Mr. Gladstone and his colleagues might meet in\r\n    the cabinet, Lord Kimberley and Sir William Harcourt on their own\r\n    part and on that of the ministers generally, used words\r\n    undeservedly kind of acknowledgment and farewell. Lord Kimberley\r\n    will pray your Majesty to appoint a council for Saturday, at as\r\n    early an hour as may be convenient.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone sat composed and still as marble, and the emotion of the\r\ncabinet did not gain him for an instant. He followed the “words of\r\nacknowledgment and farewell” in a little speech of four or five minutes,\r\nhis voice unbroken and serene, the tone low, grave, and steady. He was\r\nglad to know that he had justification in the condition of his senses. He\r\nwas glad to think that notwithstanding difference upon a public question,\r\nprivate friendships would remain unaltered and unimpaired. Then hardly\r\nabove a breath, but every accent heard, he said “God bless you all.” He\r\nrose slowly and went out of one door, while his colleagues with minds\r\noppressed filed out by the other. In his diary he enters—“A really moving\r\nscene.”\r\n\r\nA little later in the afternoon he made his last speech in the House of\r\nCommons. It was a vigorous assault upon the House of Lords. His mind had\r\nchanged since the day in September 1884 when he had declared to an\r\nemissary from the court that he hated organic change in the House of\r\nLords, and would do much to avert that mischief.(306) Circumstances had\r\nnow altered the case; we had come to a more acute stage. Were they to\r\naccept the changes made by the Lords in the bill for parish councils, or\r\nwere they to drop it? The question, he said, is whether the work of the\r\nHouse of Lords is not merely to modify, but to annihilate the whole work\r\nof the House of Commons, work which has been performed at an amount of\r\nsacrifice—of time, of labour, of convenience, and perhaps of health—but at\r\nany rate an amount of sacrifice totally unknown to the House of Lords. The\r\ngovernment had resolved that great as were the objections to acceptance of\r\nthe changes made by the Lords, the arguments against rejection were still\r\nweightier. Then he struck a note of passion, and spoke with rising fire:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    We are compelled to accompany that acceptance with the sorrowful\r\n    declaration that the differences, not of a temporary or casual\r\n    nature merely, but differences of conviction, differences of\r\n    prepossession, differences of mental habit, and differences of\r\n    fundamental tendency, between the House of Lords and the House of\r\n    Commons, appear to have reached a development in the present year\r\n    such as to create a state of things of which we are compelled to\r\n    say that, in our judgment, it cannot continue. Sir, I do not wish\r\n    to use hard words, which are easily employed and as easily\r\n    retorted—it is a game that two can play at—but without using hard\r\n    words, without presuming to judge of motives, without desiring or\r\n    venturing to allege imputations, I have felt it a duty to state\r\n    what appeared to me to be indisputable facts. The issue which is\r\n    raised between a deliberative assembly, elected by the votes of\r\n    more than 6,000,000 people, and a deliberative assembly occupied\r\n    by many men of virtue, by many men of talent, of course with\r\n    considerable diversities and varieties, is a controversy which,\r\n    when once raised, must go forward to an issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nMen did not know that they were listening to his last speech, but his\r\nwords fell in with the eager humour of his followers around him, and he\r\nsat down amid vehement plaudits. Then when the business was at an end, he\r\nrose, and for the last time walked away from the House of Commons. He had\r\nfirst addressed it sixty-one years before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following day (March 2) he busied himself in packing his papers, and\r\nworking at intervals on his translation of Horace. He told me that he had\r\nnow reason to suppose that the Queen might ask him for advice as to his\r\nsuccessor. After some talk, he said that if asked he should advise her to\r\nsend for Lord Spencer. As it happened, his advice was not sought. That\r\nevening he went to Windsor to dine and (M185) sleep. The next day was to\r\nbe the council. Here is his memorandum of the last audience on Saturday,\r\nMarch 3(307):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    As I crossed the quadrangle at 10.20 on my way to St. George’s\r\n    Chapel, I met Sir H. Ponsonby, who said he was anxious to speak to\r\n    me about the future. He was much impressed with the movement among\r\n    a body of members of parliament against having any peer for prime\r\n    minister. I signified briefly that I did not think there should be\r\n    too ready a submission to such a movement. There was not time to\r\n    say a great deal, and I had something serious to say, so we\r\n    adjourned the conversation till half past eleven, when I should\r\n    return from St. George’s.\r\n\r\n    He came at that time and opened on the same lines, desiring to\r\n    obtain from me whatever I thought proper to say as to persons in\r\n    the arrangements for the future. I replied to him that this was in\r\n    my view a most serious matter. All my thoughts on it were\r\n    absolutely at the command of the Queen. And I should be equally at\r\n    his command, if he inquired of me from her and in her name; but\r\n    that otherwise my lips must be sealed. I knew from him that he was\r\n    in search of information to report to the Queen, but this was a\r\n    totally different matter.\r\n\r\n    I entered, however, freely on the general question of the movement\r\n    among a section of the House of Commons. I thought it impossible\r\n    to say at the moment, but I should not take for granted that it\r\n    would be formidable or regard it as _in limine_ disposing of the\r\n    question. Up to a certain point, I thought it a duty to strengthen\r\n    the hands of our small minority and little knot of ministers in\r\n    the Lords, by providing these ministers with such weight as\r\n    attaches to high office. All this, or rather all that touched the\r\n    main point, namely the point of a peer prime minister, he without\r\n    doubt reported.\r\n\r\n    The council train came down and I joined the ministers in the\r\n    drawing-room. I received various messages as to the time when I\r\n    was to see the Queen, and when it would be most convenient to me.\r\n    I interpret this variety as showing that she was nervous. It ended\r\n    in fixing the time after the council and before luncheon. I\r\n    carried with me a box containing my resignation, and, the council\r\n    being over, handed it to her immediately, and told her that it\r\n    contained my tender of resignation. She asked whether she ought\r\n    then to read it. I said there was nothing in the letter to require\r\n    it. It repeated my former letter of notice, with the requisite\r\n    additions.\r\n\r\n    I must notice what, though slight, supplied the only incident of\r\n    any interest in this perhaps rather memorable audience, which\r\n    closed a service that would reach to fifty-three years on\r\n    September 3, when I was sworn privy councillor before the Queen at\r\n    Claremont. When I came into the room and came near to take the\r\n    seat she has now for some time courteously commanded, I did think\r\n    she was going to “break down.” If I was not mistaken, at any rate\r\n    she rallied herself, as I thought, by a prompt effort, and\r\n    remained collected and at her ease. Then came the conversation,\r\n    which may be called neither here nor there. Its only material\r\n    feature was negative. There was not one syllable on the past,\r\n    except a repetition, an emphatic repetition, of the thanks she had\r\n    long ago amply rendered for what I had done, a service of no great\r\n    merit, in the matter of the Duke of Coburg, and which I assured\r\n    her would not now escape my notice if occasion should arise. There\r\n    was the question of eyes and ears, of German _versus_ English\r\n    oculists, she believing in the German as decidedly superior. Some\r\n    reference to my wife, with whom, she had had an interview and had\r\n    ended it affectionately,—and various nothings. No touch on the\r\n    subject of the last Ponsonby conversation. Was I wrong in not\r\n    tendering orally my best wishes? I was afraid that anything said\r\n    by me should have the appearance of _touting_. A departing servant\r\n    has some title to offer his hopes and prayers for the future; but\r\n    a servant is one who has done, or tried to do, service in the\r\n    past. There is in all this a great sincerity. There also seems to\r\n    be some little mystery as to my own case with her. I saw no sign\r\n    of embarrassment or preoccupation. The Empress Frederick was\r\n    outside in the corridor. She bade me a most kind and warm\r\n    farewell, which I had done nothing to deserve.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter tendered to the Queen in the box was this:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gladstone presents his most humble duty to your Majesty. The\r\n    close of the session and the approach of a new one have offered\r\n    Mr. Gladstone a suitable opportunity for considering the condition\r\n    of his sight and hearing, both of them impaired, in relation to\r\n    his official obligations. As they now place serious and also\r\n    growing obstacles in the way of the efficient discharge of those\r\n    obligations, the result has been that he has found it his duty\r\n    humbly to tender to your Majesty his resignation of the high\r\n    offices which your Majesty has been pleased to intrust to him. His\r\n    desire to make this surrender is accompanied with a grateful sense\r\n    of the condescending kindnesses, which your Majesty has graciously\r\n    shown him on so many occasions during the various periods for\r\n    which he has had the honour to serve your Majesty. Mr. Gladstone\r\n    will not needlessly burden your Majesty with a recital of\r\n    particulars. He may, however, say that although at eighty-four\r\n    years of age he is sensible of a diminished capacity for prolonged\r\n    labour, this is not of itself such as would justify his praying to\r\n    be relieved from the restraints and exigencies of official life.\r\n    But his deafness has become in parliament, and even in the\r\n    cabinet, a serious inconvenience, of which he must reckon on more\r\n    progressive increase. More grave than this, and more rapid in its\r\n    growth, is the obstruction of vision which arises from cataract in\r\n    both his eyes. It has cut him off in substance from the\r\n    newspapers, and from all except the best types in the best lights,\r\n    while even as to these he cannot master them with that ordinary\r\n    facility and despatch which he deems absolutely required for the\r\n    due despatch of his public duties. In other respects than reading\r\n    the operation of the complaint is not as yet so serious, but this\r\n    one he deems to be vital. Accordingly he brings together these two\r\n    facts, the condition of his sight and hearing, and the break in\r\n    the course of public affairs brought about in the ordinary way by\r\n    the close of the session. He has therefore felt that this is the\r\n    fitting opportunity for the resignation which by this letter he\r\n    humbly prays your Majesty to accept.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of the day the Queen wrote what I take to be her last letter\r\nto him:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Windsor Castle, March 3, 1894._—Though the Queen has already\r\n    accepted Mr. Gladstone’s resignation, and has taken leave of him,\r\n    she does not like to leave his letter tendering his resignation\r\n    unanswered. She therefore writes these few lines to say that she\r\n    thinks that after so many years of arduous labour and\r\n    responsibility he is right in wishing to be relieved at his age of\r\n    these arduous duties. And she trusts he will be able to enjoy\r\n    peace and quiet with his excellent and devoted wife in health and\r\n    happiness, and that his eyesight may improve.\r\n\r\n    The Queen would gladly have conferred a peerage on Mr. Gladstone,\r\n    but she knows he would not accept it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis last act in relation to this closing scene of the great official drama\r\nwas a letter to General Ponsonby (March 5):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The first entrance of a man to Windsor Castle in a responsible\r\n    character, is a great event in his life; and his last departure\r\n    from it is not less moving. But in and during the process which\r\n    led up to this transaction on Saturday, my action has been in the\r\n    strictest sense sole, and it has required me in circumstances\r\n    partly known to harden my heart into a flint. However, it is not\r\n    even now so hard, but that I can feel what you have most kindly\r\n    written; nor do I fail to observe with pleasure that you do not\r\n    speak absolutely in the singular. If there were feelings that made\r\n    the occasion sad, such feelings do not die with the occasion. But\r\n    this letter must not be wholly one of egotism. I have known and\r\n    have liked and admired all the men who have served the Queen in\r\n    your delicate and responsible office; and have liked most,\r\n    probably because I knew him most, the last of them, that most\r\n    true-hearted man, General Grey. But forgive me for saying you are\r\n    “to the manner born”; and such a combination of tact and temper\r\n    with loyalty, intelligence, and truth I cannot expect to see\r\n    again. Pray remember these are words which can only pass from an\r\n    old man to one much younger, though trained in a long experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is hardly in human nature, in spite of Charles V., Sulla, and some\r\nother historic persons, to lay down power beyond recall, without a secret\r\npang. In Prior’s lines that came to the mind of brave Sir Walter Scott, as\r\nhe saw the curtain falling on his days,—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The man in graver tragic known,\r\n    (Though his best part long since was done,)\r\n    Still on the stage desires to tarry....\r\n    Unwilling to retire, though weary.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether the departing minister had a lingering thought that in the\r\ndispensations of the world, purposes and services would still arise to\r\nwhich even yet he might one day be summoned, we do not know. Those who\r\nwere nearest to him believe not, and assuredly he made no outer sign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX. The Close. (1894-1898)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Natural death is as it were a haven and a rest to us after long\r\n    navigation. And the noble Soul is like a good mariner; for he,\r\n    when he draws near the port, lowers his sails and enters it softly\r\n    with gentle steerage.... And herein we have from our own nature a\r\n    great lesson of suavity; for in such a death as this there is no\r\n    grief nor any bitterness: but as a ripe apple is lightly and\r\n    without violence loosened from its branch, so our soul without\r\n    grieving departs from the body in which it hath been.—DANTE,\r\n    _Convito_.(308)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the first wrench was over, and an end had come to the demands,\r\npursuits, duties, glories, of powerful and active station held for a long\r\nlifetime, Mr. Gladstone soon settled to the new conditions of his\r\nexistence, knowing that for him all that could be left was, in the figure\r\nof his great Italian poet,“to lower sails and gather in his ropes.”(309)\r\nHe was not much in London, and when he came he stayed in the pleasant\r\nretreat to which his affectionate and ever-attached friends, Lord and Lady\r\nAberdeen, so often invited him at Dollis Hill. Much against his will, he\r\ndid not resign his seat in the House, and he held it until the dissolution\r\nof 1895.(310) In June (1895) he took a final cruise in one of Sir Donald\r\nCurrie’s ships, visiting Hamburg, the new North Sea canal, and Copenhagen\r\nonce more. His injured sight was a far deadlier breach in the habit of his\r\ndays than withdrawal from office or from parliament. His own tranquil\r\nwords written in the year in which he laid down his part in the shows of\r\nthe world’s huge stage, tell the story:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _July 25, 1894._—For the first time in my life there has been\r\n    given to me by the providence of God a period of comparative\r\n    leisure, reckoning at the present date to four and a half months.\r\n    Such a period drives the mind in upon itself, and invites, almost\r\n    constrains, to recollection, and the rendering at least internally\r\n    an account of life; further it lays the basis of a habit of\r\n    meditation, to the formation of which the course of my existence,\r\n    packed and crammed with occupation outwards, never stagnant,\r\n    oft-times overdriven, has been extremely hostile. As there is no\r\n    life which in its detail does not seem to afford intervals of\r\n    brief leisure, or what is termed “waiting” for others engaged with\r\n    us in some common action, these are commonly spent in murmurs and\r\n    in petulant desire for their termination. But in reality they\r\n    supply excellent opportunities for brief or ejaculatory prayer.\r\n\r\n    As this new period of my life has brought with it my retirement\r\n    from active business in the world, it affords a good opportunity\r\n    for breaking off the commonly dry daily journal, or ledger as it\r\n    might almost be called, in which for seventy years I have recorded\r\n    the chief details of my outward life. If life be continued I\r\n    propose to note in it henceforward only principal events or\r\n    occupations. This first breach since the latter part of May in\r\n    this year has been involuntary. When the operation on my eye for\r\n    cataract came, it was necessary for a time to suspend all use of\r\n    vision. Before that, from the beginning of March, it was only my\r\n    out-of-door activity or intercourse that had been paralysed....\r\n    For my own part, _suave mari magno_ steals upon me; or at any\r\n    rate, an inexpressible sense of relief from an exhausting life of\r\n    incessant contention. A great revolution has been operated in my\r\n    correspondence, which had for many years been a serious burden,\r\n    and at times one almost intolerable. During the last months of\r\n    partial incapacity I have not written with my own hand probably so\r\n    much as one letter per day. Few people have had a smaller number\r\n    of _otiose_ conversations probably than I in the last fifty years;\r\n    but I have of late seen more friends and more freely, though\r\n    without practical objects in view. Many kind friends have read\r\n    books to me; I must place Lady Sarah Spencer at the head of the\r\n    proficients in that difficult art; in distinctness of\r\n    articulation, with low clear voice, she is supreme. Dearest\r\n    Catherine has been my chaplain from morning to morning. My\r\n    church-going has been almost confined to mid-day communions, which\r\n    have not required my abandonment of the reclining posture for long\r\n    periods of time. Authorship has not been quite in abeyance; I have\r\n    been able to write what I was not allowed to read, and have\r\n    composed two theological articles for the _Nineteenth Century_ of\r\n    August and September respectively.(311)\r\n\r\n    Independently of the days of blindness after the operation, the\r\n    visits of doctors have become a noticeable item of demand upon\r\n    time. Of physic I incline to believe I have had as much, in 1894\r\n    as in my whole previous life. I have learned for the first time\r\n    the extraordinary comfort of the aid which the attendance of a\r\n    nurse can give. My health will now be matter of little interest\r\n    except to myself. But I have not yet abandoned the hope that I may\r\n    be permitted to grapple with that considerable armful of work,\r\n    which had been long marked out for my old age; the question of my\r\n    recovering sight being for the present in abeyance.\r\n\r\n    _Sept. 13._—I am not yet thoroughly accustomed to my new stage of\r\n    existence, in part because the remains of my influenza have not\r\n    yet allowed me wholly to resume the habits of health. But I am\r\n    thoroughly content with my retirement; and I cast no longing,\r\n    lingering look behind. I pass onward from it _oculo irretorto_.\r\n    There is plenty of work before me, peaceful work and work directed\r\n    to the supreme, _i.e._ the spiritual cultivation of mankind, if it\r\n    pleases God to give me time and vision to perform it.\r\n\r\n    _Oct. 1._—As far as I can at present judge, all the signs of the\r\n    eye being favourable, the new form of vision will enable me to get\r\n    through in a given time about half the amount of work which would\r\n    have been practicable under the old. I speak of reading and\r\n    writing work, which have been principal with me when I had the\r\n    option. In conversation there is no difference, although there are\r\n    various drawbacks in what we call society. On the 20th of last\r\n    month when I had gone through my crises of trials, Mr. Nettleship,\r\n    [the oculist], at once declared that any further operation would\r\n    be superfluous.\r\n\r\n    I am unable to continue attendance at the daily morning service,\r\n    not on account of the eyesight but because I may not rise before\r\n    ten at the earliest. And so a Hawarden practice of over fifty\r\n    years is interrupted; not without some degree of hope that it may\r\n    be resumed. Two evening services, one at 5 P.M. and the other at\r\n    7, afford me a limited consolation. I drive almost every day, and\r\n    thus grow to my dissatisfaction more burdensome. My walking powers\r\n    are limited; once I have exceeded two miles by a little. A large\r\n    part of the day remains available at my table; daylight is\r\n    especially precious; my correspondence is still a weary weight,\r\n    though I have admirable help from children. Upon the whole the\r\n    change is considerable. In early and mature life a man walks to\r\n    his daily work with a sense of the duty and capacity of\r\n    self-provision, a certain αὐτάρκεια [independence] (which the\r\n    Greeks carried into the moral world). Now that sense is reversed;\r\n    it seems as if I must, God knows how reluctantly, lay burdens upon\r\n    others; and as if capacity were, so to speak, dealt out to me\r\n    mercifully—but by armfuls.\r\n\r\n\r\nOld age until the very end brought no grave changes in physical\r\nconditions. He missed sorely his devoted friend, Sir Andrew Clark, to\r\nwhose worth as man and skill as healer he had borne public testimony in\r\nMay 1894. But for physician’s service there was no special need. His\r\nordinary life, though of diminished power, suffered little interruption.\r\n“The attitude,” he wrote, “in which I endeavoured to fix myself was that\r\nof a soldier on parade, in a line of men drawn up ready to march and\r\nwaiting for the word of command. I sought to be in preparation for prompt\r\nobedience, feeling no desire to go, but on the other hand without\r\nreluctance because firmly convinced that whatever He ordains for us is\r\nbest, best both for us and for all.”\r\n\r\nHe worked with all his old zest at his edition of Bishop Butler, and his\r\nvolume of studies subsidiary to Butler. He wrote to the Duke of Argyll\r\n(Dec. 5, 1895):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I find my Butler a weighty undertaking, but I hope it will be\r\n    useful at least for the important improvements of form which I am\r\n    making.\r\n\r\n    It is very difficult to keep one’s temper in dealing with M.\r\n    Arnold when he touches on religious matters. His patronage of a\r\n    Christianity fashioned by himself is to me more offensive and\r\n    trying than rank unbelief. But I try, or seem to myself to try, to\r\n    shrink from controversy of which I have had so much. Organic\r\n    evolution sounds to me a Butlerish idea, but I doubt if he ever\r\n    employed either term, certainly he has not the phrase, and I\r\n    cannot as yet identify the passage to which you may refer.\r\n\r\n    _Dec. 9._—Many thanks for your letter. The idea of evolution is\r\n    without doubt deeply ingrained in Butler. The case of the animal\r\n    creation had a charm for him, and in his first chapter he opens,\r\n    without committing himself, the idea of their possible elevation\r\n    to a much higher state. I have always been struck by the glee with\r\n    which negative writers strive to get rid of “special creation,” as\r\n    if by that method they got the idea of God out of their way,\r\n    whereas I know not what right they have to say that the small\r\n    increments effected by the divine workman are not as truly special\r\n    as the large. It is remarkable that Butler has taken such hold\r\n    both on nonconformists in England and outside of England,\r\n    especially on those bodies in America which are descended from\r\n    English non-conformists.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe made progress with his writings on the Olympian Religion, without\r\nregard to Acton’s warnings and exhortations to read a score of volumes by\r\nlearned explorers with uncouth names. He collected a new series of his\r\n_Gleanings_. By 1896 he had got his cherished project of hostel and\r\nlibrary at St. Deiniol’s in Hawarden village, near to its launch. He was\r\ndrawn into a discussion on the validity of anglican orders, and even wrote\r\na letter to Cardinal Rampolla, in his effort to realise the dream of\r\nChristian unity. The Vatican replied in such language as might have been\r\nexpected by anybody with less than Mr. Gladstone’s inextinguishable faith\r\nin the virtues of argumentative persuasion. Soon he saw the effects of\r\nChristian disunion upon a bloodier stage. In the autumn of this year he\r\nwas roused to one more vehement protest like that twenty years before\r\nagainst the abominations of Turkish rule, this time in Armenia. He had\r\nbeen induced to address a meeting in Chester in August 1895, and now a\r\nyear later he travelled to Liverpool (Sept. 24) to a non-party gathering\r\nat Hengler’s Circus. He always described this as the place most agreeable\r\nto the speaker of all those with which he was acquainted. “Had I the years\r\nof 1876 upon me,” he said to one of his sons, “gladly would I start\r\nanother campaign, even if as long as that.”\r\n\r\nTo discuss, almost even to describe, the course of his policy and\r\nproceedings in the matter of Armenia, would bring us into a mixed\r\ncontroversy affecting statesmen now living, who played an unexpected part,\r\nand that controversy may well stand over for another, and let us hope a\r\nvery distant, day. Whether we had a right to interfere single-handed;\r\nwhether we were bound as a duty to interfere under the Cyprus Convention;\r\nwhether our intervention would provoke hostilities on the part of other\r\nPowers and even kindle a general conflagration in Europe; whether our\r\nseverance of diplomatic relations with the Sultan or our withdrawal from\r\nthe concert of Europe would do any good; what possible form armed\r\nintervention could take—all these are questions on which both liberals and\r\ntories vehemently differed from one another then, and will vehemently\r\ndiffer again. Mr. Gladstone was bold and firm in his replies. As to the\r\nidea, he said, that all independent action on the part of this great\r\ncountry was to be made chargeable for producing war in Europe, “that is in\r\nmy opinion a mistake almost more deplorable than almost any committed in\r\nthe history of diplomacy.” We had a right under the convention. We had a\r\nduty under the responsibilities incurred at Paris in 1856, at Berlin in\r\n1878. The upshot of his arguments at Liverpool was that we should break\r\noff relations with the Sultan; that we should undertake not to turn\r\nhostilities to our private advantage; that we should limit our proceedings\r\nto the suppression of mischief in its aggravated form; and if Europe\r\nthreatened us with war it might be necessary to recede, as France had\r\nreceded under parallel circumstances from her individual policy on the\r\neastern question in 1840,—receded without loss either of honour or power,\r\nbelieving that she had been right and wise and others wrong and unwise.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Gladstone had still had, as he puts it, “the years of 1876,” he\r\nmight have made as deep a mark. As it was, his speech at Liverpool was his\r\nlast great deliverance to a public audience. As the year ended this was\r\nhis birthday entry:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Dec. 29, 1896._—My long and tangled life this day concludes its\r\n    87th year. My father died four days short of that term. I know of\r\n    no other life so long in the Gladstone family, and my profession\r\n    has been that of politician, or, more strictly, minister of state,\r\n    an extremely short-lived race when their scene of action has been\r\n    in the House of Commons, Lord Palmerston being the only complete\r\n    exception. In the last twelve months eyes and ears may have\r\n    declined, but not materially. The occasional contraction of the\r\n    chest is the only inconvenience that can be called new. I am not\r\n    without hope that Cannes may have a [illegible] to act upon it.\r\n    The blessings of family life continue to be poured in the largest\r\n    measure upon my unworthy head. Even my temporal affairs have\r\n    thriven. Still old age is appointed for the gradual loosening and\r\n    succeeding snapping of the threads. I visited Lord Stratford when\r\n    he was, say, 90 or 91 or thereabouts. He said to me, “It is not a\r\n    blessing.” As to politics, I think the basis of my mind is laid\r\n    principally in finance and philanthropy. The prospects of the\r\n    first are darker than I have ever known them. Those of the second\r\n    are black also, but with more hope of some early dawn. I do not\r\n    enter on interior matters. It is so easy to write, but to write\r\n    honestly nearly impossible. Lady Grosvenor gave me to-day a\r\n    delightful present of a small crucifix. I am rather too\r\n    independent of symbol.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the last entry in the diaries of seventy years.\r\n\r\nAt the end of January 1897, the Gladstones betook themselves once more to\r\nLord Rendel’s _palazzetto_, as they called it, at Cannes.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I had hoped during this excursion, he journalises, to make much\r\n    way with my autobiographica. But this was in a large degree\r\n    frustrated, first by invalidism, next by the eastern question, on\r\n    which I was finally obliged to write something.(312) Lastly, and\r\n    not least, by a growing sense of decline in my daily amount of\r\n    brain force available for serious work. My power to read (but to\r\n    read very slowly indeed since the cataract came) for a\r\n    considerable number of hours daily, thank God, continues. This is\r\n    a great mercy. While on my outing, I may have read, of one kind\r\n    and another, twenty volumes. Novels enter into this list rather\r\n    considerably. I have begun seriously to ask myself whether I shall\r\n    ever be able to face “The Olympian Religion.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Queen happened to be resident at Cimiez at this time, and Mr.\r\nGladstone wrote about their last meeting:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    A message came down to us inviting us to go into the hotel and\r\n    take tea with the Princess Louise. We repaired to the hotel, and\r\n    had our tea with Miss Paget, who was in attendance. The Princess\r\n    soon came in, and after a short delay we were summoned into the\r\n    Queen’s presence. No other English people were on the ground. We\r\n    were shown into a room tolerably, but not brilliantly lighted,\r\n    much of which was populated by a copious supply of Hanoverian\r\n    royalties. The Queen was in the inner part of the room, and behind\r\n    her stood the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge.\r\n    Notwithstanding my enfeebled sight, my vision is not much impaired\r\n    for practical purposes in cases such as this, where I am\r\n    thoroughly familiar with the countenance and whole contour of any\r\n    person to be seen. My wife preceded, and Mary followed me. The\r\n    Queen’s manner did not show the old and usual vitality. It was\r\n    still, but at the same time very decidedly kind, such as I had not\r\n    seen it for a good while before my final resignation. She gave me\r\n    her hand, a thing which is, I apprehended, rather rare with men,\r\n    and which had never happened with me during all my life, though\r\n    that life, be it remembered, had included some periods of rather\r\n    decided favour. Catherine sat down near her, and I at a little\r\n    distance. For a good many years she had habitually asked me to\r\n    sit. My wife spoke freely and a good deal to the Queen, but the\r\n    answers appeared to me to be very slight. As to myself, I\r\n    expressed satisfaction at the favourable accounts I had heard of\r\n    the accommodation at Cimiez, and perhaps a few more words of\r\n    routine. To speak frankly, it seemed to me that the Queen’s\r\n    peculiar faculty and habit of conversation had disappeared. It was\r\n    a faculty, not so much the free offspring of a rich and powerful\r\n    mind, as the fruit of assiduous care with long practice and much\r\n    opportunity. After about ten minutes, it was signified to us that\r\n    we had to be presented to all the other royalties, and so passed\r\n    the remainder of this meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early autumn of 1897 he found himself affected by (M186) what was\r\nsupposed to be a peculiar form of catarrh. He went to stay with Mr.\r\nArmitstead at Butterstone in Perthshire. I saw him on several occasions\r\nafterwards, but this was the last time when I found him with all the\r\nfreedom, full self-possession, and kind geniality of old days. He was\r\nkeenly interested at my telling him that I had seen James Martineau a few\r\ndays before, in his cottage further north in Inverness-shire; that\r\nMartineau, though he had now passed his ninety-second milestone on life’s\r\nroad, was able to walk five or six hundred feet up his hillside every day,\r\nwas at his desk at eight each morning, and read theology a good many hours\r\nbefore he went to bed at night. Mr. Gladstone’s conversation was varied,\r\nglowing, full of reminiscence. He had written me in the previous May,\r\nhoping among other kind things that “we may live more and more in sympathy\r\nand communion.” I never saw him more attractive than in the short pleasant\r\ntalks of these three or four days. He discussed some of the sixty or\r\nseventy men with whom he had been associated in cabinet life,(313) freely\r\nbut charitably, though he named two whom he thought to have behaved worse\r\nto him than others. He repeated his expression of enormous admiration for\r\nGraham. Talked about his own voice. After he had made his long budget\r\nspeech in 1860, a certain member, supposed to be an operatic expert, came\r\nto him and said, “You must take great care, or else you will destroy the\r\n_colour_ in your voice.” He had kept a watch on general affairs. The\r\nspeech of a foreign ruler upon divine right much incensed him. He thought\r\nthat Lord Salisbury had managed to set the Turk up higher than he had\r\nreached since the Crimean war; and his policy had weakened Greece, the\r\nmost liberal of the eastern communities. We fought over again some old\r\nbattles of 1886 and 1892-4. Mr. Armitstead had said to him—“Oh, sir,\r\nyou’ll live ten years to come.” “I do trust,” he answered as he told me\r\nthis, “that God in his mercy will spare me that.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThen came months of distress. The facial annoyance grew into acute and\r\ncontinued pain, and to pain he proved to be exceedingly sensitive. It did\r\nnot master him, but there were moments that seemed almost of collapse and\r\ndefeat. At last the night was gathering\r\n\r\n\r\n            About the burning crest\r\n    Of the old, feeble, and day-wearied sun.(314)\r\n\r\n\r\nThey took him at the end of November (1897) to Cannes, to the house of\r\nLord Rendel.\r\n\r\nSometimes at dinner he talked with his host, with Lord Welby, or Lord\r\nActon, with his usual force, but most of the time he lay in extreme\r\nsuffering and weariness, only glad when they soothed him with music. It\r\nwas decided that he had better return, and in hope that change of air\r\nmight even yet be some palliative, he went to Bournemouth, which he\r\nreached on February 22. For weeks past he had not written nor read, save\r\none letter that he wrote in his journey home to Lady Salisbury upon a\r\nrather narrow escape of her husband’s in a carriage accident. On March 18\r\nhis malady was pronounced incurable, and he learned that it was likely to\r\nend in a few weeks. He received the verdict with perfect serenity and with\r\na sense of unutterable relief, for his sufferings had been cruel. Four\r\ndays later he started home to die. On leaving Bournemouth before stepping\r\ninto the train, he turned round, and to those who were waiting on the\r\nplatform to see him off, he said with quiet gravity, “God bless you and\r\nthis place, and the land you love.” At Hawarden he bore the dreadful\r\nburden of his pain with fortitude, supported by the ritual ordinances of\r\nhis church and faith. Music soothed him, the old composers being those he\r\nliked best to hear. Messages of sympathy were read to him, and he listened\r\nsilently or with a word of thanks.\r\n\r\n“The retinue of the whole world’s good wishes” flowed to the “large upper\r\nchamber looking to the sunrising, where the aged pilgrim lay.” Men and\r\nwomen of every communion offered up earnest prayers for him. Those who\r\nwere of no communion thought with pity, sympathy, and sorrow of\r\n\r\n\r\n    A Power passing from the earth\r\n    To breathless Nature’s dark abyss.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M187) From every rank in social life came outpourings in every key of\r\nreverence and admiration. People appeared—as is the way when death\r\ncomes—to see his life and character as a whole, and to gather up in his\r\npersonality, thus transfigured by the descending shades, all the best\r\nhopes and aspirations of their own best hours. A certain grandeur\r\noverspread the moving scene. Nothing was there for tears. It was “no\r\nimportunate and heavy load.” The force was spent, but it had been nobly\r\nspent in devoted and effective service for his country and his fellow-men.\r\n\r\nFrom the Prince of the Black Mountain came a telegram: “Many years ago,\r\nwhen Montenegro, my beloved country, was in difficulties and in danger,\r\nyour eloquent voice and powerful pen successfully pleaded and worked on\r\nher behalf. At this time vigorous and prosperous, with a bright future\r\nbefore her, she turns with sympathetic eye to the great English statesman\r\nto whom she owes so much, and for whose present sufferings she feels so\r\ndeeply.” And he answered by a message that “his interest in Montenegro had\r\nalways been profound, and he prayed that it might prosper and be blessed\r\nin all its undertakings.”\r\n\r\nOf the thousand salutations of pity and hope none went so much to his\r\nheart as one from Oxford—an expression of true feeling, in language worthy\r\nof her fame:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    At yesterday’s meeting of the hebdomadal council, wrote the\r\n    vice-chancellor, an unanimous wish was expressed that I should\r\n    convey to you the message of our profound sorrow and affection at\r\n    the sore trouble and distress which you are called upon to endure.\r\n    While we join in the universal regret with which the nation\r\n    watches the dark cloud which has fallen upon the evening of a\r\n    great and impressive life, we believe that Oxford may lay claim to\r\n    a deeper and more intimate share in this sorrow. Your brilliant\r\n    career in our university, your long political connection with it,\r\n    and your fine scholarship, kindled in this place of ancient\r\n    learning, have linked you to Oxford by no ordinary bond, and we\r\n    cannot but hope that you will receive with satisfaction this\r\n    expression of deep-seated kindliness and sympathy from us.\r\n\r\n    We pray that the Almighty may support you and those near and dear\r\n    to you in this trial, and may lighten the load of suffering which\r\n    you bear with such heroic resignation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this he listened more attentively and over it he brooded long, then he\r\ndictated to his youngest daughter sentence by sentence at intervals his\r\nreply:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    There is no expression of Christian sympathy that I value more\r\n    than that of the ancient university of Oxford, the God-fearing and\r\n    God-sustaining university of Oxford. I served her, perhaps\r\n    mistakenly, but to the best of my ability. My most earnest prayers\r\n    are hers to the uttermost and to the last.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen May opened, it was evident that the end was drawing near. On the 13th\r\nhe was allowed to receive visits of farewell from Lord Rosebery and from\r\nmyself, the last persons beyond his household to see him. He was hardly\r\nconscious. On the early morning of the 19th, his family all kneeling\r\naround the bed on which he lay in the stupor of coming death, without a\r\nstruggle he ceased to breathe. Nature outside—wood and wide lawn and\r\ncloudless far-off sky—shone at her fairest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day after his death, in each of the two Houses the leader made the\r\nmotion, identical in language in both cases save the few final words about\r\nfinancial provision in the resolution of the Commons:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    That an humble Address be presented to her Majesty praying that\r\n    her Majesty will be graciously pleased to give directions that the\r\n    remains of the Right Hon. William Ewart Gladstone be interred at\r\n    the public charge, and that a monument be erected in the\r\n    Collegiate Church of St. Peter, Westminster, with an inscription\r\n    expressive of the public admiration and attachment and of the high\r\n    sense entertained of his rare and splendid gifts, and of his\r\n    devoted labours to parliament and in great offices of state, and\r\n    to assure her Majesty that this House will make good the expenses\r\n    attending the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe language of the movers was worthy of the British parliament at its\r\nbest, worthy of the station of those who (M188) used it, and worthy of the\r\nfigure commemorated. Lord Salisbury was thought by most to go nearest to\r\nthe core of the solemnity:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    What is the cause of this unanimous feeling? Of course, he had\r\n    qualities that distinguished him from all other men; and you may\r\n    say that it was his transcendent intellect, his astonishing power\r\n    of attaching men to him, and the great influence he was able to\r\n    exert upon the thought and convictions of his contemporaries. But\r\n    these things, which explain the attachment, the adoration of those\r\n    whose ideas he represented, would not explain why it is that\r\n    sentiments almost as fervent are felt and expressed by those whose\r\n    ideas were not carried out by his policy. My Lords, I do not think\r\n    the reason is to be found in anything so far removed from the\r\n    common feelings of mankind as the abstruse and controversial\r\n    questions of the policy of the day. They had nothing to do with\r\n    it. Whether he was right, or whether he was wrong, in all the\r\n    measures, or in most of the measures which he proposed—those are\r\n    matters of which the discussion has passed by, and would certainly\r\n    be singularly inappropriate here; they are really remitted to the\r\n    judgment of future generations, who will securely judge from\r\n    experience what we can only decide by forecast. It was on account\r\n    of considerations more common to the masses of human beings, to\r\n    the general working of the human mind, than any controversial\r\n    questions of policy that men recognised in him a man\r\n    guided—whether under mistaken impressions or not, it matters\r\n    not—but guided in all the steps he took, in all the efforts that\r\n    he made, by a high moral ideal. What he sought were the\r\n    attainments of great ideals, and, whether they were based on sound\r\n    convictions or not, they could have issued from nothing but the\r\n    greatest and the purest moral aspirations; and he is honoured by\r\n    his countrymen, because through so many years, across so many\r\n    vicissitudes and conflicts, they had recognised this one\r\n    characteristic of his action, which has never ceased to be felt.\r\n    He will leave behind him, especially to those who have followed\r\n    with deep interest the history of the later years—I might almost\r\n    say the later months of his life—he will leave behind him the\r\n    memory of a great Christian statesman. Set up necessarily on\r\n    high—the sight of his character, his motives, and his intentions\r\n    would strike all the world. They will have left a deep and most\r\n    salutary influence on the political thought and the social thought\r\n    of the generation in which he lived, and he will be long\r\n    remembered not so much for the causes in which he was engaged or\r\n    the political projects which he favoured, but as a great example,\r\n    to which history hardly furnishes a parallel, of a great Christian\r\n    man.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Balfour, the leader in the Commons, specially spoke of him as “the\r\ngreatest member of the greatest deliberative assembly that the world has\r\nseen,” and most aptly pointed to Mr. Gladstone’s special service in\r\nrespect of that assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n    One service he did, in my opinion incalculable, which is\r\n    altogether apart from the judgment that we may be disposed to pass\r\n    upon particular opinions, or particular lines of policy which Mr.\r\n    Gladstone may from time to time have advocated. Sir, he added a\r\n    dignity, as he added a weight, to the deliberations of this House\r\n    by his genius, which I think it is impossible adequately to\r\n    replace. It is not enough for us to keep up simply a level, though\r\n    it be a high level, of probity and of patriotism. The mere average\r\n    of civic virtue is not sufficient to preserve this Assembly from\r\n    the fate that has overcome so many other Assemblies, products of\r\n    democratic forces. More than this is required; more than this was\r\n    given to us by Mr. Gladstone. He brought to our debates a genius\r\n    which compelled attention, he raised in the public estimation the\r\n    whole level of our proceedings, and they will be most ready to\r\n    admit the infinite value of his service who realise how much of\r\n    public prosperity is involved in the maintenance of the worth of\r\n    public life, and how perilously difficult most democracies\r\n    apparently feel it to be to avoid the opposite dangers into which\r\n    so many of them have fallen.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir William Harcourt spoke of him as friend and official colleague:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have heard men who knew him not at all, who have asserted that\r\n    the supremacy of his genius and the weight of his authority\r\n    oppressed and overbore those who lived with him and those who\r\n    worked under him. Nothing could be more untrue. Of all chiefs he\r\n    was the least exacting. He was the most kind, the most tolerant,\r\n    he was the most placable. How seldom in this House was the voice\r\n    of personal anger heard from his lips. These are the true marks of\r\n    greatness.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Rosebery described his gifts and powers, his concentration, the\r\nmultiplicity of his interests, his labour of every day, and almost of\r\nevery hour of every day, in fashioning an intellect that was mighty by\r\nnature. And besides this panegyric on the departed warrior, he touched\r\nwith felicity and sincerity a note of true feeling in recalling to his\r\nhearers\r\n\r\n\r\n    the solitary and pathetic figure, who for sixty years, shared all\r\n    the sorrows and all the joys of Mr. Gladstone’s life, who received\r\n    his confidence and every aspiration, who shared his triumphs with\r\n    him and cheered him under his defeats; who by her tender\r\n    vigilance, I firmly believe, sustained and prolonged his years.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the memorial speeches were over the House of Commons adjourned. The\r\nQueen, when the day of the funeral came, telegraphed to Mrs. Gladstone\r\nfrom Balmoral:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    My thoughts are much with you to-day, when your dear husband is\r\n    laid to rest. To-day’s ceremony will be most trying and painful\r\n    for you, but it will be at the same time gratifying to you to see\r\n    the respect and regret evinced by the nation for the memory of one\r\n    whose character and intellectual abilities marked him as one of\r\n    the most distinguished statesmen of my reign. I shall ever\r\n    gratefully remember his devotion and zeal in all that concerned my\r\n    personal welfare and that of my family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not at Westminster only that his praise went forth. Famous men, in\r\nthe immortal words of Pericles to his Athenians, have the whole world for\r\ntheir tomb; they are commemorated not only by columns and inscriptions in\r\ntheir own land; in foreign lands too a memorial of them is graven in the\r\nhearts of men. So it was here. No other statesman on our famous roll has\r\ntouched the imagination of so wide a world.\r\n\r\nThe colonies through their officers or more directly, sent to Mrs.\r\nGladstone their expression of trust that the worldwide admiration and\r\nesteem of her honoured and illustrious husband would help her to sustain\r\nher burden of sorrow. The ambassador of the United States reverently\r\ncongratulated her and the English race everywhere, upon the glorious\r\ncompletion of a life filled with splendid achievements and consecrated to\r\nthe noblest purposes. The President followed in the same vein, and in\r\nCongress words were found to celebrate a splendid life and character. The\r\nPresident of the French republic wished to be among the first to associate\r\nhimself with Mrs. Gladstone’s grief: “By the high liberality of his\r\ncharacter,” he said, “and by the nobility of his political ideal, Mr.\r\nGladstone had worthily served his country and humanity.” The entire French\r\ngovernment requested the British ambassador in Paris to convey the\r\nexpression of their sympathy and assurance of their appreciation,\r\nadmiration, and respect for the character of the illustrious departed. The\r\nCzar of Russia telegraphed to Mrs. Gladstone: “I have just received the\r\npainful news of Mr. Gladstone’s decease, and consider it my duty to\r\nexpress to you my feelings of sincere sympathy on the occasion of the\r\ncruel and irreparable bereavement which has befallen you, as well as the\r\ndeep regret which this sad event has given me. The whole of the civilised\r\nworld will beweep the loss of a great statesman, whose political views\r\nwere so widely humane and peaceable.”\r\n\r\nIn Italy the sensation was said to be as great as when Victor Emmanuel or\r\nGaribaldi died. The Italian parliament and the prime minister telegraphed\r\nto the effect that “the cruel loss which had just struck England, was a\r\ngrief sincerely shared by all who are devoted to liberty. Italy has not\r\nforgotten, and will never forget, the interest and sympathy of Mr.\r\nGladstone in events that led to its independence.” In the same key,\r\nGreece: the King, the first minister, the university, the chamber,\r\ndeclared that he was entitled to the gratitude of the Greek people, and\r\nhis name would be by them for ever venerated. From Roumania, Macedonia,\r\nNorway, Denmark, tributes came “to the great memory of Gladstone, one of\r\nthe glories of mankind.” Never has so wide and honourable a pomp all over\r\nthe globe followed an English statesman to the grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 25, the remains were brought from Hawarden, and in the middle of\r\nthe night the sealed coffin was placed in Westminster Hall, watched until\r\nthe funeral by the piety of relays of friends. For long hours each day\r\ngreat multitudes filed past the bier. It was a striking demonstration of\r\nnational feeling, for the procession contained every rank, and contingents\r\ncame from every part of the kingdom. On Saturday, May 28, the body was\r\ncommitted to the grave in Westminster Abbey. No sign of high honour was\r\nabsent. The heir to the throne and his son were among those who bore the\r\npall. So were the prime minister and the two leaders of the parties in\r\nboth Houses. The other pall-bearers were Lord Rosebery who had succeeded\r\nhim as prime minister, the Duke of Rutland who had half a century before\r\nbeen Mr. Gladstone’s colleague at Newark, and Mr. Armitstead and Lord\r\nRendel, who were his private friends. Foreign sovereigns sent their\r\nrepresentatives, the Speaker of the House of Commons was there in state,\r\nand those were there who had done stout battle against him for long years;\r\nthose also who had sat with him in council and stood by his side in\r\nfrowning hours. At the head of the grave was “the solitary and pathetic\r\nfigure” of his wife. Even men most averse to all pomps and shows on the\r\noccasions and scenes that declare so audibly their nothingness, here were\r\nonly conscious of a deep and moving simplicity, befitting a great citizen\r\nnow laid among the kings and heroes. Two years later, the tomb was opened\r\nto receive the faithful and devoted companion of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X. Final.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnybody can see the host of general and speculative questions raised by a\r\ncareer so extraordinary. How would his fame have stood if his political\r\nlife had ended in 1854, or 1874, or 1881, or 1885? What light does it shed\r\nupon the working of the parliamentary system; on the weakness and strength\r\nof popular government; on the good and bad of political party; on the\r\nsuperiority of rule by cabinet or by an elected president; on the\r\nrelations of opinion to law? Here is material for a volume of\r\ndisquisition, and nobody can ever discuss such speculations without\r\nreference to power as it was exercised by Mr. Gladstone. Those thronged\r\nhalls, those vast progresses, those strenuous orations—what did they\r\namount to? Did they mean a real moulding of opinion, an actual impression,\r\nwhether by argument or temper or personality or all three, on the minds of\r\nhearers? Or was it no more than the same kind of interest that takes men\r\nto stage-plays with a favourite performer? This could hardly be, for his\r\nhearers gave him long spells of power and a practical authority that was\r\nunique and supreme. What thoughts does his career suggest on the relations\r\nof Christianity to patriotism, or to empire, or to what has been called\r\nneo-paganism? How many points arise as to the dependence of ethics on\r\ndogma? These are deep and living and perhaps burning issues, not to be\r\ndiscussed at the end of what the reader may well have found a long\r\njourney. They offer themselves for his independent consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone’s own summary of the period in which he (M189) had been so\r\nconspicuous a figure was this, when for him the drama was at an end:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Of his own career, he says, it is a career certainly chargeable\r\n    with many errors of judgment, but I hope on the whole, governed at\r\n    least by uprightness of intention and by a desire to learn. The\r\n    personal aspect may now readily be dismissed as it concerns the\r\n    past. But the public aspect of the period which closes for me with\r\n    the fourteen years (so I love to reckon them) of my formal\r\n    connection with Midlothian is too important to pass without a\r\n    word. I consider it as beginning with the Reform Act of Lord\r\n    Grey’s government. That great Act was for England improvement and\r\n    extension, for Scotland it was political birth, the beginning of a\r\n    duty and a power, neither of which had attached to the Scottish\r\n    nation in the preceding period. I rejoice to think how the\r\n    solemnity of that duty has been recognised, and how that power has\r\n    been used. The three-score years offer us the pictures of what the\r\n    historian will recognise as a great legislative and administrative\r\n    period—perhaps, on the whole, the greatest in our annals. It has\r\n    been predominantly a history of emancipation—that is of enabling\r\n    man to do his work of emancipation, political, economical, social,\r\n    moral, intellectual. Not numerous merely, but almost numberless,\r\n    have been the causes brought to issue, and in every one of them I\r\n    rejoice to think that, so far as my knowledge goes, Scotland has\r\n    done battle for the right.\r\n\r\n    Another period has opened and is opening still—a period possibly\r\n    of yet greater moral dangers, certainly a great ordeal for those\r\n    classes which are now becoming largely conscious of power, and\r\n    never heretofore subject to its deteriorating influences. These\r\n    have been confined in their actions to the classes above them,\r\n    because they were its sole possessors. Now is the time for the\r\n    true friend of his country to remind the masses that their present\r\n    political elevation is owing to no principles less broad and noble\r\n    than these—the love of liberty, of liberty for all without\r\n    distinction of class, creed or country, and the resolute\r\n    preference of the interests of the whole to any interest, be it\r\n    what it may, of a narrower scope.(315)\r\n\r\n\r\nA year later, in bidding farewell to his constituents “with sentiments of\r\ngratitude and attachment that can never be effaced,” he proceeds:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Though in regard to public affairs many things are disputable,\r\n    there are some which belong to history and which have passed out\r\n    of the region of contention. It is, for example as I conceive,\r\n    beyond question that the century now expiring has exhibited since\r\n    the close of its first quarter a period of unexampled activity\r\n    both in legislative and administrative changes; that these\r\n    changes, taken in the mass, have been in the direction of true and\r\n    most beneficial progress; that both the conditions and the\r\n    franchises of the people have made in relation to the former state\r\n    of things, an extraordinary advance; that of these reforms an\r\n    overwhelming proportion have been effected by direct action of the\r\n    liberal party, or of statesmen such as Peel and Canning, ready to\r\n    meet odium or to forfeit power for the public good; and that in\r\n    every one of the fifteen parliaments the people of Scotland have\r\n    decisively expressed their convictions in favour of this wise,\r\n    temperate, and in every way remarkable policy.(316)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo charge him with habitually rousing popular forces into dangerous\r\nexcitement, is to ignore or misread his action in some of the most\r\ncritical of his movements. “Here is a man,” said Huxley, “with the\r\ngreatest intellect in Europe, and yet he debases it by simply following\r\nmajorities and the crowd.” He was called a mere mirror of the passing\r\nhumours and intellectual confusions of the popular mind. He had nothing,\r\nsaid his detractors, but a sort of clever pilot’s eye for winds and\r\ncurrents, and the rising of the tide to the exact height that would float\r\nhim and his cargo over the bar. All this is the exact opposite of the\r\ntruth. What he thought was that the statesman’s gift consisted in insight\r\ninto the facts of a particular era, disclosing the existence of material\r\nfor forming public opinion and directing public opinion to a given\r\npurpose. In every one of his achievements of high mark—even in his last\r\nmarked failure of achievement—he expressly formed, or endeavoured to form\r\nand create, the public opinion upon which he knew that in the last resort\r\nhe must depend.\r\n\r\n(M190) We have seen the triumph of 1853.(317) Did he, in renewing the most\r\nhated of taxes, run about anxiously feeling the pulse of public opinion?\r\nOn the contrary, he grappled with the facts with infinite labour—and half\r\nhis genius was labour—he built up a great plan; he carried it to the\r\ncabinet; they warned him that the House of Commons would be against him;\r\nthe officials of the treasury told him the Bank would be against him; that\r\na strong press of commercial interests would be against him. Like the bold\r\nand sinewy athlete that he always was, he stood to his plan; he carried\r\nthe cabinet; he persuaded the House of Commons; he vanquished the Bank and\r\nthe hostile interests; and in the words of Sir Stafford Northcote, he\r\nchanged and turned for many years to come, a current of public opinion\r\nthat seemed far too powerful for any minister to resist. In the\r\ntempestuous discussions during the seventies on the policy of this country\r\nin respect of the Christian races of the Balkan Peninsula, he with his own\r\nvoice created, moulded, inspired, and kindled with resistless flame the\r\nwhole of the public opinion that eventually guided the policy of the\r\nnation with such admirable effect both for its own fame, and for the good\r\nof the world. Take again the Land Act of 1881, in some ways the most\r\ndeep-reaching of all his legislative achievements. Here he had no flowing\r\ntide, every current was against him. He carried his scheme against the\r\nignorance of the country, against the prejudice of the country, and\r\nagainst the standing prejudices of both branches of the legislature, who\r\nwere steeped from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot in the\r\nstrictest doctrines of contract.\r\n\r\nThen his passion for economy, his ceaseless war against public profusion,\r\nhis insistence upon rigorous keeping of the national accounts—in this\r\ngreat department of affairs he led and did not follow. In no sphere of his\r\nactivities was he more strenuous, and in no sphere, as he must well have\r\nknown, was he less likely to win popularity. For democracy is spendthrift;\r\nif, to be sure, we may not say that most forms of government are apt to be\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nIn a survey of Mr. Gladstone’s performances, some would place this of\r\nwhich I have last spoken, as foremost among his services to the country.\r\nOthers would call him greatest in the associated service of a skilful\r\nhandling and adjustment of the burden of taxation; or the strengthening of\r\nthe foundations of national prosperity and well-being by his reformation\r\nof the tariff. Yet others again choose to remember him for his share in\r\nguiding the successive extensions of popular power, and simplifying and\r\npurifying electoral machinery. Irishmen at least, and others so far as\r\nthey are able to comprehend the history and vile wrongs and sharp needs of\r\nIreland, will have no doubt what rank in legislation they will assign to\r\nthe establishment of religious equality and agrarian justice in that\r\nportion of the realm. Not a few will count first the vigour with which he\r\nrepaired what had been an erroneous judgment of his own and of vast hosts\r\nof his countrymen, by his courage in carrying through the submission of\r\nthe Alabama claims to arbitration. Still more, looking from west to east,\r\nin this comparison among his achievements, will judge alike in its result\r\nand in the effort that produced it, nothing equal to the valour and\r\ninsight with which he burst the chains of a mischievous and degrading\r\npolicy as to the Ottoman empire. When we look at this exploit, how in face\r\nof an opponent of genius and authority and a tenacity not inferior to his\r\nown, in face of strongly rooted tradition on behalf of the Turk, and an\r\neasily roused antipathy against the Russian, by his own energy and\r\nstrength of arm he wrested the rudder from the hand of the helmsman and\r\nput about the course of the ship, and held England back from the enormity\r\nof trying to keep several millions of men and women under the yoke of\r\nbarbaric oppression and misrule,—we may say that this great feat alone was\r\nfame enough for one statesman. Let us make what choice we will of this or\r\nthat particular achievement, how splendid a list it is of benefits\r\nconferred and public work effectually performed. Was he a good\r\nparliamentary tactician, they ask? Was his eye sure, his hand firm, his\r\nmeasurement of forces, distances, and possibilities of change in wind and\r\ntide accurate? Did he usually hit the proper moment for a magisterial\r\nintervention? Experts did not (M191) always agree on his quality as\r\ntactician. At least he was pilot enough to bring many valuable cargoes\r\nsafely home.\r\n\r\nHe was one of the three statesmen in the House of Commons of his own\r\ngeneration who had the gift of large and spacious conception of the place\r\nand power of England in the world, and of the policies by which she could\r\nmaintain it. Cobden and Disraeli were the other two. Wide as the poles\r\nasunder in genius, in character, and in the mark they made upon the\r\nnation, yet each of these three was capable of wide surveys from high\r\neminence. But Mr. Gladstone’s performances in the sphere of active\r\ngovernment were beyond comparison.\r\n\r\nAgain he was often harshly judged by that tenacious class who insist that\r\nif a general principle be sound, there can never be a reason why it should\r\nnot be applied forthwith, and that a rule subject to exceptions is not\r\nworth calling a rule; and the worst of it is that these people are mostly\r\nthe salt of the earth. In their impatient moments they dismissed him as an\r\nopportunist, but whenever there was a chance of getting anything done,\r\nthey mostly found that he was the only man with courage and resolution\r\nenough to attempt to do it. In thinking about him we have constantly to\r\nremember, as Sir George Lewis said, that government is a very rough affair\r\nat best, a huge rough machine, not the delicate springs, wheels, and\r\nbalances of a chronometer, and those concerned in working it have to be\r\nsatisfied with what is far below the best. “Men have no business to talk\r\nof disenchantment,” Mr. Gladstone said; “ideals are never realised.” That\r\nis no reason, he meant, why men should not persist and toil and hope, and\r\nthis is plainly the true temper for the politician. Yet he did not feed\r\nupon illusions. “The history of nations,” he wrote in 1876, “is a\r\nmelancholy chapter; that is, the history of governments is one of the most\r\nimmoral parts of human history.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt might well be said that Mr. Gladstone took too little, rather than too\r\nmuch trouble to be popular. His religious conservatism puzzled and\r\nirritated those who admired and shared his political liberalism, just as\r\nchurchmen watched with uneasiness and suspicion his radical alliances.\r\nNeither those who were churchmen first, nor those whose interests were\r\nkeenest in politics, could comprehend the union of what seemed\r\nincompatibles, and because they could not comprehend they sometimes in\r\ntheir shallower humours doubted his sincerity. Mr. Gladstone was never,\r\nafter say 1850, really afraid of disestablishment; on the contrary he was\r\nmuch more afraid of the perils of establishment for the integrity of the\r\nfaith. Yet political disestablishers often doubted him, because they had\r\nnot logic enough to see that a man may be a fervent believer in anglican\r\ninstitutions and what he thinks catholic tradition, and yet be as ready as\r\nCavour for the principle of free church in free state.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that some of the things that made men suspicious, were in\r\nfact the liveliest tokens of his sincerity and simplicity. With all his\r\npower of political imagination, yet his mind was an intensely literal\r\nmind. He did not look at an act or a decision from the point of view at\r\nwhich it might be regarded by other people. Ewelme, the mission to the\r\nIonian Islands, the royal warrant, the affair of the judicial committee,\r\nvaticanism, and all the other things that gave offence, and stirred\r\nmisgivings even in friends, showed that the very last question he ever\r\nasked himself was how his action would look; what construction might be\r\nput upon it, or even would pretty certainly be put upon it; whom it would\r\nencourage, whom it would estrange, whom it would perplex. Is the given end\r\nright, he seemed to ask; what are the surest means; are the means as right\r\nas the end, as right as they are sure? But right—on strict and literal\r\nconstruction. What he sometimes forgot was that in political action,\r\nconstruction is part of the act, nay, may even be its most important\r\npart.(318)\r\n\r\nThe more you make of his errors, the more is the need to explain his vast\r\nrenown, the long reign of his authority, the substance and reality of his\r\npowers. We call men great for many reasons apart from service wrought or\r\neminence of intellect or even from force and depth of character. To (M192)\r\nhave taken a leading part in transactions of decisive moment; to have\r\nproved himself able to meet demands on which high issues hung; to combine\r\nintellectual qualities, though moderate yet adequate and sufficient, with\r\nthe moral qualities needed for the given circumstance—with daring,\r\ncircumspection, energy, intrepid initiative; to have fallen in with one of\r\nthose occasions in the world that impart their own greatness even to a\r\nmediocre actor, and surround his name with a halo not radiating from\r\nwithin but shed upon him from without—in all these and many other ways men\r\ncome to be counted great. Mr. Gladstone belongs to the rarer class who\r\nacquired authority and fame by transcendent qualities of genius within, in\r\nhalf independence of any occasions beyond those they create for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nOf his attitude in respect of church parties, it is not for me to speak.\r\nHe has himself described at least one aspect of it in a letter to an\r\ninquirer, which would be a very noble piece by whomsoever written, and in\r\nthe name of whatsoever creed or no-creed, whether Christian or Rationalist\r\nor Nathan the Wise Jew’s creed. It was addressed to a clergyman who seems\r\nto have asked of what section Mr. Gladstone considered himself an\r\nadherent:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Feb. 4, 1865._—It is impossible to misinterpret either the\r\n    intention or the terms of your letter; and I thank you for it\r\n    sincerely. But I cannot answer the question which you put to me,\r\n    and I think I can even satisfy you that with my convictions I\r\n    should do wrong in replying to it in any manner. Whatever reason I\r\n    may have for being painfully and daily conscious of every kind of\r\n    unworthiness, yet I am sufficiently aware of the dignity of\r\n    religious belief to have been throughout a political life, now in\r\n    its thirty-third year, steadily resolved never by my own voluntary\r\n    act to make it the subject of any compact or assurance with a view\r\n    to a political object. You think (and pray do not suppose I make\r\n    this matter of complaint) that I have been associated with one\r\n    party in the church of England, and that I may now lean rather\r\n    towards another.... There is no one about whom information can be\r\n    more easily had than myself. I have had and have friends of many\r\n    colours, churchmen high and low, presbyterians, Greeks, Roman\r\n    catholics, dissenters, who can speak abundantly, though perhaps\r\n    not very well of me. And further, as member for the university, I\r\n    have honestly endeavoured at all times to put my constituents in\r\n    possession of all I could convey to them that could be considered\r\n    as in the nature of a fact, by answering as explicitly as I was\r\n    able all questions relating to the matters, and they are numerous\r\n    enough, on which I have had to act or speak. Perhaps I shall\r\n    surprise you by what I have yet further to say. I have never by\r\n    any conscious act yielded my allegiance to any person or party in\r\n    matters of religion. You and others may have called me (without\r\n    the least offence) a churchman of some particular kind, and I have\r\n    more than once seen announced in print my own secession from the\r\n    church of England. These things I have not commonly contradicted,\r\n    for the atmosphere of religious controversy and contradiction is\r\n    as odious as the atmosphere of mental freedom is precious, to me;\r\n    and I have feared to lose the one and be drawn into the other, by\r\n    heat and bitterness creeping into the mind. If another chooses to\r\n    call himself, or to call me, a member of this or that party, I am\r\n    not to complain. But I respectfully claim the right not to call\r\n    myself so, and on this claim, I have I believe acted throughout my\r\n    life, without a single exception; and I feel that were I to waive\r\n    it, I should at once put in hazard that allegiance to Truth, which\r\n    is at once the supreme duty and the supreme joy of life. I have\r\n    only to add the expression of my hope that in what I have said\r\n    there is nothing to hurt or to offend you; and, if there be, very\r\n    heartily to wish it unsaid.\r\n\r\n\r\nYet there was never the shadow of mistake about his own fervent faith. As\r\nhe said to another correspondent:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Feb. 5, 1876._—I am in principle a strong denominationalist. “One\r\n    fold and one shepherd” was the note of early Christendom. The\r\n    shepherd is still one and knows his sheep; but the folds are many;\r\n    and, without condemning any others, I am of opinion that it is\r\n    best for us all that we should all of us be jealous for the honour\r\n    of whatever we have and hold as positive truth, appertaining to\r\n    the Divine Word and the foundation and history of the Christian\r\n    community. I admit that this question becomes one of circumstance\r\n    and degree, but I take it as I find it defined for myself by and\r\n    in my own position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Mr. Gladstone as orator and improvisatore, enough has been said and\r\nseen. Besides being orator and statesman he was scholar and critic.\r\nPerhaps scholar in his interests, not in abiding contribution. The most\r\ncopious of his productions in this delightful but arduous field was the\r\nthree large volumes on _Homer and the Homeric Age_, given to the world in\r\n1858. Into what has been well called the whirlpool of Homeric\r\ncontroversies, the reader shall not here be dragged. Mr. Gladstone himself\r\ngave them the go-by, with an indifference and disdain such as might have\r\nbeen well enough in the economic field if exhibited towards a\r\nprotectionist farmer, or a partisan of retaliatory duties on manufactured\r\ngoods, but that were hardly to the point in dealing with profound and\r\noriginal critics. What he too contemptuously dismissed as Homeric\r\n“bubble-schemes,” were in truth centres of scientific illumination. At the\r\nend of the eighteenth century Wolf’s famous _Prolegomena_ appeared, in\r\nwhich he advanced the theory that Homer was no single poet, nor a name for\r\ntwo poets, nor an individual at all; the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ were\r\ncollections of independent lays, folk-lore and folk-songs connected by a\r\ncommon set of themes, and edited, redacted, or compacted about the middle\r\nof the sixth century before Christ. A learned man of our own day has said\r\nthat F. A. Wolf ought to be counted one of the half dozen writers that\r\nwithin the last three centuries have most influenced thought. This would\r\nbring Wolf into line with Descartes, Newton, Locke, Kant, Rousseau, or\r\nwhatever other five master-spirits of thought from then to now the\r\njudicious reader may select. The present writer has assuredly no\r\ncompetence to assign Wolf’s place in the history of modern criticism, but\r\nstraying aside for a season from the green pastures of Hansard, and\r\nturning over again the slim volume of a hundred and fifty pages in which\r\nWolf discusses his theme, one may easily discern a fountain of broad\r\nstreams of modern thought (apart from the particular thesis) that to Mr.\r\nGladstone, by the force of all his education and his deepest\r\nprepossessions, were in the highest degree chimerical and dangerous.\r\n\r\nHe once wrote to Lord Acton (1889) about the Old Testament and Mosaic\r\nlegislation:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Now I think that the most important parts of the argument have in\r\n    a great degree a solid standing ground apart from the destructive\r\n    criticism on dates and on the text: and I am sufficiently aware of\r\n    my own rawness and ignorance in the matter not to allow myself to\r\n    judge definitely, or condemn. I feel also that I have a\r\n    prepossession derived from the criticisms in the case of Homer. Of\r\n    them I have a very bad opinion, not only in themselves, but as to\r\n    the levity, precipitancy, and shallowness of mind which they\r\n    display; and here I do venture to speak, because I believe myself\r\n    to have done a great deal more than any of the destructives in the\r\n    examination of the text, which is the true source of the materials\r\n    of judgment. They are a soulless lot; but there was a time when\r\n    they had possession of the public ear as much I suppose as the Old\r\n    Testament destructives now have, within their own precinct. It is\r\n    only the constructive part of their work on which I feel tempted\r\n    to judge; and I must own that it seems to me sadly wanting in the\r\n    elements of rational probability.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis unpromising method is sufficiently set out when he says: “I find in\r\nthe plot of the _Iliad_ enough of beauty, order, and structure, not merely\r\nto sustain the supposition of its own unity, but to bear an independent\r\ntestimony, should it be still needed, to the existence of a personal and\r\nindividual Homer as its author.”(319) From such a method no permanent\r\ncontribution could come.\r\n\r\nYet scholars allow that Mr. Gladstone in these three volumes, as well as\r\nin _Juventus Mundi_ and his _Homeric Primer_, has added not a little to\r\nour scientific knowledge of the Homeric poems,(320) by his extraordinary\r\nmastery of the text, the result of unwearied and prolonged industry, aided\r\n(M193) by a memory both tenacious and ready. Taking his own point of view,\r\nmoreover, anybody who wishes to have his feeling about the _Iliad_ and\r\n_Odyssey_ as delightful poetry refreshed and quickened, will find\r\ninspiring elements in the profusion, the eager array of Homer’s own lines,\r\nthe diligent exploration of aspects and bearings hitherto unthought of.\r\nThe “theo-mythology” is commonly judged fantastic, and has been compared\r\nby sage critics to Warburton’s _Divine Legation_—the same comprehensive\r\ngeneral reading, the same heroic industry in marshalling the particulars\r\nof proof, the same dialectical strength of arm, and all brought to prove\r\nan unsound proposition.(321) Yet the comprehensive reading and the\r\nparticulars of proof are by no means without an interest of their own,\r\nwhatever we may think of the proposition; and here, as in all his literary\r\nwriting distinguished from polemics, he abounds in the ethical elements.\r\nHere perhaps more than anywhere else he impresses us by his love of beauty\r\nin all its aspects and relations, in the human form, in landscape, in the\r\naffections, in animals, including above all else that sense of beauty\r\nwhich made his Greeks take it as one of the names for nobility in conduct.\r\nConington, one of the finest of scholars, then lecturing at Oxford on\r\nLatin poets and deep in his own Virgilian studies, which afterwards bore\r\nsuch admirable fruit, writes at length (Feb. 14, 1857) to say how grateful\r\nhe is to Mr. Gladstone for the care with which he has pursued into details\r\na view of Virgil that they hold substantially in common, and proceeds with\r\ncare and point to analyse the quality of the Roman poet’s art, as some\r\nyears later he defended against Munro the questionable proposition of the\r\nsuperiority in poetic style of the graceful, melodious, and pathetic\r\nVirgil to Lucretius’s mighty muse.\r\n\r\nNo field has been more industriously worked for the last forty years than\r\nthis of the relations of paganism to the historic religion that followed\r\nit in Europe. The knowledge and the speculations into which Mr. Gladstone\r\nwas thus initiated in the sixties may now seem crude enough; but he\r\ndeserves some credit in English, though not in view of German, speculation\r\nfor an early perception of an unfamiliar region of comparative science,\r\nwhence many a product most unwelcome to him and alien to his own beliefs\r\nhas been since extracted. When all is said, however, Mr. Gladstone’s place\r\nis not in literary or critical history, but elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHis style is sometimes called Johnsonian, but surely without good ground.\r\nJohnson was not involved and he was clear, and neither of these things can\r\nalways be said of Mr. Gladstone. Some critic charged him in 1840 with\r\n“prolix clearness.” The old charge, says Mr. Gladstone upon this, was\r\n“obscure compression. I do not doubt that both may be true, and the former\r\nmay have been the result of a well-meant effort to escape from the\r\nlatter.” He was fond of abstract words, or the nearer to abstract the\r\nbetter, and the more general the better. One effect of this was\r\nundoubtedly to give an indirect, almost a shifty, air that exasperated\r\nplain people. Why does he beat about the bush, they asked; why cannot he\r\nsay what he means? A reader might have to think twice or thrice or twenty\r\ntimes before he could be sure that he interpreted correctly. But then\r\npeople are so apt to think once, or half of once; to take the meaning that\r\nsuits their own wish or purpose best, and then to treat that as the only\r\nmeaning. Hence their perplexity and wrath when they found that other doors\r\nwere open, and they thought a mistake due to their own hurry was the\r\nresult of a juggler’s trick. On the other hand a good writer takes all the\r\npains he can to keep his reader out of such scrapes.\r\n\r\nHis critical essays on Tennyson and Macaulay are excellent. They are\r\nacute, discriminating, generous. His estimate of Macaulay, apart from a\r\npiece of polemical church history at the end, is perhaps the best we have.\r\n“You make a very just remark,” said Acton to him, “that Macaulay was\r\nafraid of contradicting his former self, and remembered all he had written\r\nsince 1825. At that time his mind was formed, and so it remained. What\r\nliterary influences acted on the formation of his political opinions, what\r\nwere his religious sympathies, and what is his exact place among\r\nhistorians, you have rather avoided discussing. There is still something\r\nto say on these points.” To Tennyson Mr. Gladstone believed himself to\r\nhave been unjust, especially in the passages of _Maud_ devoted to the\r\nwar-frenzy, and when he came to reprint the article he admitted that he\r\nhad not sufficiently remembered that he was dealing with a dramatic and\r\nimaginative composition.(322) As he frankly said of himself, he was not\r\nstrong in the faculties of the artist, but perhaps Tennyson himself in\r\nthese passages was prompted much more by politics than by art. Of this\r\npiece of retractation the poet truly said, “Nobody but a noble-minded man\r\nwould have done that.”(323) Mr. Gladstone would most likely have chosen to\r\ncall his words a qualification rather than a recantation. In either case,\r\nit does not affect passages that give the finest expression to one of the\r\nvery deepest convictions of his life,—that war, whatever else we may\r\nchoose to say of it, is no antidote for Mammon-worship and can never be a\r\ncure for moral evils:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is, indeed, true that peace has its moral perils and\r\n    temptations for degenerate man, as has every other blessing,\r\n    without exception, that he can receive from the hand of God. It is\r\n    moreover not less true that, amidst the clash of arms, the noblest\r\n    forms of character may be reared, and the highest acts of duty\r\n    done; that these great and precious results may be due to war as\r\n    their cause; and that one high form of sentiment in particular,\r\n    the love of country, receives a powerful and general stimulus from\r\n    the bloody strife. But this is as the furious cruelty of Pharaoh\r\n    made place for the benign virtue of his daughter; as the\r\n    butchering sentence of Herod raised without doubt many a mother’s\r\n    love into heroic sublimity; as plague, as famine, as fire, as\r\n    flood, as every curse and every scourge that is wielded by an\r\n    angry Providence for the chastisement of man, is an appointed\r\n    instrument for tempering human souls in the seven-times heated\r\n    furnace of affliction, up to the standard of angelic and\r\n    archangelic virtue.\r\n\r\n    War, indeed, has the property of exciting much generous and noble\r\n    feeling on a large scale; but with this special recommendation it\r\n    has, in its modern forms especially, peculiar and unequalled\r\n    evils. As it has a wider sweep of desolating power than the rest,\r\n    so it has the peculiar quality that it is more susceptible of\r\n    being decked in gaudy trappings, and of fascinating the\r\n    imagination of those whose proud and angry passions it inflames.\r\n    But it is, on this very account, a perilous delusion to teach that\r\n    war is a cure for moral evil, in any other sense than as the\r\n    sister tribulations are. The eulogies of the frantic hero in\r\n    _Maud_, however, deviate into grosser folly. It is natural that\r\n    such vagaries should overlook the fixed laws of Providence. Under\r\n    these laws the mass of mankind is composed of men, women, and\r\n    children who can but just ward off hunger, cold, and nakedness;\r\n    whose whole ideas of Mammon-worship are comprised in the search\r\n    for their daily food, clothing, shelter, fuel; whom any casualty\r\n    reduces to positive want; and whose already low estate is yet\r\n    further lowered and ground down, when “the blood-red blossom of\r\n    war flames with its heart of fire.”...\r\n\r\n    Still war had, in times now gone by, ennobling elements and\r\n    tendencies of the less sordid kind. But one inevitable\r\n    characteristic of modern war is, that it is associated throughout,\r\n    in all particulars, with a vast and most irregular formation of\r\n    commercial enterprise. There is no incentive to Mammon-worship so\r\n    remarkable as that which it affords. The political economy of war\r\n    is now one of its most commanding aspects. Every farthing, with\r\n    the smallest exceptions conceivable, of the scores or hundreds of\r\n    millions which a war may cost, goes directly, and very violently,\r\n    to stimulate production, though it is intended ultimately for\r\n    waste or for destruction. Even apart from the fact that war\r\n    suspends, _ipso facto_, every rule of public thrift, and tends to\r\n    sap honesty itself in the use of the public treasure for which it\r\n    makes such unbounded calls, it therefore is the greatest feeder of\r\n    that lust of gold which we are told is the essence of commerce,\r\n    though we had hoped it was only its occasional besetting sin. It\r\n    is, however, more than this; for the regular commerce of peace is\r\n    tameness itself compared with the gambling spirit which war,\r\n    through the rapid shiftings and high prices which it brings,\r\n    always introduces into trade. In its moral operation it more\r\n    resembles, perhaps the finding of a new gold-field, than anything\r\n    else.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore remarkable than either of these two is his piece on Leopardi (1850),\r\nthe Italian poet, whose philosophy and (M194) frame of mind, said Mr.\r\nGladstone, “present more than any other that we know, more even than that\r\nof Shelley, the character of unrelieved, unredeemed desolation—the very\r\nqualities in it which attract pitying sympathy, depriving it of all\r\nseductive power.” It is curious that he should have selected one whose\r\nlife lay along a course like Leopardi’s for commemoration, as a man who in\r\nalmost every branch of mental exertion seems to have had the capacity for\r\nattaining, and generally at a single bound, the very highest excellence.\r\n“There are many things,” he adds, “in which Christians would do well to\r\nfollow him: in the warmth of his attachments; in the moderation of his\r\nwants; in his noble freedom from the love of money; in his all-conquering\r\nassiduity.”(324) Perhaps the most remarkable sentence of all is this: “...\r\nwhat is not needful, and is commonly wrong, namely, is to pass a judgment\r\non our fellow-creatures. Never let it be forgotten that there is scarcely\r\na single moral action of a single man of which other men can have such a\r\nknowledge, in its ultimate grounds, its surrounding incidents, and the\r\nreal determining causes of its merits, as to warrant their pronouncing a\r\nconclusive judgment upon it.”\r\n\r\nThe translation of poetry into poetry, as Coleridge said, is difficult\r\nbecause the translator must give brilliancy without the warmth of original\r\nconception, from which such brilliancy would follow of its own accord. But\r\nwe must not judge Mr. Gladstone’s translation either of Horace’s odes or\r\nof detached pieces from Greek or Italian, as we should judge the professed\r\nman of letters or poet like Coleridge himself. His pieces are the\r\ndiversions of the man of affairs, with educated tastes and interest in\r\ngood literature. Perhaps the best single piece is his really noble\r\nrendering of Manzoni’s noble ode on the death of Napoleon; for instance:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        From Alp to farthest Pyramid,\r\n          From Rhine to Mansanar,\r\n        How sure his lightning’s flash foretold\r\n          His thunderbolts of war!\r\n    To Don from Scilla’s height they roar,\r\n    From North to Southern shore.\r\n        And this was glory? After-men,\r\n          Judge the dark problem. Low\r\n        We to the Mighty Maker bend\r\n          The while, Who planned to show\r\n    What vaster mould Creative Will\r\n      With him could fill.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\n        As on the shipwrecked mariner\r\n          The weltering wave’s descent—\r\n        The wave, o’er which, a moment since,\r\n          For distant shores he bent\r\n    And bent in vain, his eager eye;\r\n      So on that stricken head\r\n        Came whelming down the mighty Past.\r\n          How often did his pen\r\n        Essay to tell the wondrous tale\r\n          For after times and men,\r\n    And o’er the lines that could not die\r\n      His hand lay dead.\r\n\r\n        How often, as the listless day\r\n        In silence died away,\r\n        He stood with lightning eye deprest,\r\n        And arms across his breast,\r\n    And bygone years, in rushing train,\r\n    Smote on his soul amain:\r\n        The breezy tents he seemed to see,\r\n        And the battering cannon’s course,\r\n        And the flashing of the infantry,\r\n        And the torrent of the horse,\r\n    And, obeyed as soon as heard,\r\n      Th’ ecstatic word.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlways let us remember that his literary life was part of the rest of his\r\nlife, as literature ought to be. He was no mere reader of many books, used\r\nto relieve the strain of mental anxiety or to slake the thirst of literary\r\nor intellectual curiosity. Reading with him in the days of his full vigour\r\nwas a habitual communing with the master spirits of mankind, as a\r\nvivifying and nourishing part of life. As we have seen, he would not read\r\nDante in the session, nor unless he could have a large draught. Here as\r\nelsewhere in the ordering of his days he was methodical, systematic, full.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\n(M195) Though man of action, yet Mr. Gladstone too has a place by\r\ncharacter and influences among what we may call the abstract, moral,\r\nspiritual forces that stamped the realm of Britain in his age. In a new\r\ntime, marked in an incomparable degree by the progress of science and\r\ninvention, by vast mechanical, industrial, and commercial development, he\r\naccepted it all, he adjusted his statesmanship to it all, nay, he revelled\r\nin it all, as tending to ameliorate the lot of the “mass of men, women,\r\nand children who can just ward off hunger, cold, and nakedness.” He did\r\nnot rail at his age, he strove to help it. Following Walpole and Cobden\r\nand Peel in the policies of peace, he knew how to augment the material\r\nresources on which our people depend. When was Britain stronger, richer,\r\nmore honoured among the nations—I do not say always among the diplomatic\r\nchanceries and governments—than in the years when Mr. Gladstone was at the\r\nzenith of his authority among us? When were her armed forces by sea and\r\nland more adequate for defence of every interest? When was her material\r\nresource sounder? When was her moral credit higher? Besides all this, he\r\nupheld a golden lamp.\r\n\r\nThe unending revolutions of the world are for ever bringing old phases\r\nuppermost again. Events from season to season are taken to teach sinister\r\nlessons, that the Real is the only Rational, force is the test of right\r\nand wrong, the state has nothing to do with restraints of morals, the\r\nruler is emancipated. Speculations in physical science were distorted for\r\nalien purposes, and survival of the fittest was taken to give brutality a\r\nmore decent name. Even new conceptions and systems of history may be\r\ntwisted into release of statesmen from the conscience of Bishop Butler’s\r\nplain man. This gospel it was Mr. Gladstone’s felicity to hold at bay.\r\nWithout bringing back the cosmopolitanism of the eighteenth century,\r\nwithout sharing all the idealisms of the middle of the nineteenth, he\r\nresisted with his whole might the odious contention that moral progress in\r\nthe relations of nations and states to one another is an illusion and a\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nThis vein perhaps brings us too near to the regions of dissertation. Let\r\nus rather leave off with thoughts and memories of one who was a vivid\r\nexample of public duty and of private faithfulness; of a long career that\r\nwith every circumstance of splendour, amid all the mire and all the\r\npoisons of the world, lighted up in practice even for those who have none\r\nof his genius and none of his power his own precept, “Be inspired with the\r\nbelief that life is a great and noble calling; not a mean and grovelling\r\nthing, that we are to shuffle through as we can, but an elevated and lofty\r\ndestiny.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIrish Local Government, 1883. (Page 103)\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Gladstone to Lord Granville_\r\n\r\n    _Cannes, Jan. 22, 1883._—Today I have been a good deal distressed\r\n    by a passage as reported in Hartington’s very strong and able\r\n    speech, for which I am at a loss to account, so far does it travel\r\n    out into the open, and so awkward are the intimations it seems to\r\n    convey. I felt that I could not do otherwise than telegraph to you\r\n    in cipher on the subject. But I used words intended to show that,\r\n    while I thought an immediate notification needful, I was far from\r\n    wishing to hasten the reply, and desired to leave altogether in\r\n    your hands the mode of touching a delicate matter. Pray use the\r\n    widest discretion.\r\n\r\n    I console myself with thinking it is hardly possible that\r\n    Hartington can have meant to say what nevertheless both _Times_\r\n    and _Daily News_ make him seem to say, namely, that we recede\r\n    from, or throw into abeyance, the declarations we have constantly\r\n    made about our desire to extend local government, properly so\r\n    called, to Ireland on the first opportunity which the state of\r\n    business in parliament would permit. We announced our intention to\r\n    do this at the very moment when we were preparing to suspend the\r\n    Habeas Corpus Act. Since that time we have seen our position in\r\n    Ireland immensely strengthened, and the leader of the agitation\r\n    has even thought it wise, and has dared, to pursue a somewhat\r\n    conciliatory course. Many of his coadjutors are still as vicious,\r\n    it may be, as ever, but how can we say (for instance) to the\r\n    Ulster men, you shall remain with shortened liberties and without\r\n    local government, because Biggar & Co. are hostile to British\r\n    connection?\r\n\r\n    There has also come prominently into view a new and powerful set\r\n    of motives which, in my deliberate judgment, require us, for the\r\n    sake of the United Kingdom even more than for the sake of Ireland,\r\n    to push forward this question. Under the present highly\r\n    centralised system of government, every demand which can be\r\n    started on behalf of a poor and ill-organised country, comes\r\n    directly on the British government and treasury; if refused it\r\n    becomes at once a head of grievance, if granted not only a new\r\n    drain but a certain source of political complication and\r\n    embarrassment. The peasant proprietary, the winter’s distress, the\r\n    state of the labourers, the loans to farmers, the promotion of\r\n    public works, the encouragement of fisheries, the promotion of\r\n    emigration, each and every one of these questions has a sting, and\r\n    the sting can only be taken out of it by our treating it in\r\n    correspondence with a popular and responsible Irish body,\r\n    competent to act for its own portion of the country.\r\n\r\n    Every consideration which prompted our pledges, prompts the\r\n    recognition of them, and their extension, rather than curtailment.\r\n    The Irish government have in preparation a Local Government bill.\r\n    Such a bill may even be an economy of time. By no other means that\r\n    I can see shall we be able to ward off most critical and\r\n    questionable discussions on questions of the class I have\r\n    mentioned. The argument that we cannot yet trust Irishmen with\r\n    popular local institutions is the mischievous argument by which\r\n    the conservative opposition to the Melbourne government resisted,\r\n    and finally crippled, the reform of municipal corporations in\r\n    Ireland. By acting on principles diametrically opposite, we have\r\n    broken down to thirty-five or forty what would have been a party,\r\n    in this parliament, of sixty-five home rulers, and have thus\r\n    arrested (or at the very least postponed) the perilous crisis,\r\n    which no man has as yet looked in the face; the crisis which will\r\n    arise when a large and united majority of Irish members demand\r\n    some fundamental change in the legislative relations of the two\r\n    countries. I can ill convey to you how dear are my thoughts, or\r\n    how earnest my convictions, on this important subject....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Gordon’s Instructions. (Page 153)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The following is the text of General Gordon’s Instructions (Jan. 18,\r\n1884)_:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Her Majesty’s government are desirous that you should proceed at\r\n    once to Egypt, to report to them on the military situation in the\r\n    Soudan, and on the measures it may be advisable to take for the\r\n    security of the Egyptian garrisons still holding positions in that\r\n    country, and for the safety of the European population in\r\n    Khartoum. You are also desired to consider and report upon the\r\n    best mode of effecting the evacuation of the interior of the\r\n    Soudan, and upon the manner in which the safety and good\r\n    administration by the Egyptian government of the ports on the sea\r\n    coast can best be secured. In connection with this subject you\r\n    should pay especial consideration to the question of the steps\r\n    that may usefully be taken to counteract the stimulus which it is\r\n    feared may possibly be given to the slave trade by the present\r\n    insurrectionary movement, and by the withdrawal of the Egyptian\r\n    authority from the interior. You will be under the instructions of\r\n    Her Majesty’s agent and consul-general at Cairo, through whom your\r\n    reports to Her Majesty’s government should be sent under flying\r\n    seal. You will consider yourself authorised and instructed to\r\n    perform such other duties as the Egyptian government may desire to\r\n    entrust to you, and as may be communicated to you by Sir E.\r\n    Baring. You will be accompanied by Colonel Stewart, who will\r\n    assist you in the duties thus confided to you. On your arrival in\r\n    Egypt you will at once communicate with Sir E. Baring, who will\r\n    arrange to meet you and will settle with you whether you should\r\n    proceed direct to Suakin or should go yourself or despatch Colonel\r\n    Stewart _viâ_ the Nile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Military Position In The Soudan, April 1885. (Page 179)\r\n\r\n\r\n_This Memorandum, dated April 9, 1885, was prepared by Mr. Gladstone for\r\nthe cabinet_:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The commencement of the hot season appears, with other\r\n    circumstances, to mark the time for considering at large our\r\n    position in the Soudan. Also a declaration of policy is now\r\n    demanded from us in nearly all quarters.... When the betrayal of\r\n    Khartoum had been announced, the desire and intention of the\r\n    cabinet were to reserve for a later decision the question of an\r\n    eventual advance upon that place, should no immediate movement on\r\n    it be found possible. The objects they had immediately in view\r\n    were to ascertain the fate of Gordon, to make every effort on his\r\n    behalf, and to prevent the extension of the area of disturbance.\r\n\r\n    But Lord Wolseley at once impressed upon the cabinet that he\r\n    required, in order to determine his immediate military movements,\r\n    to know whether they were to be based upon the plan of an eventual\r\n    advance on Khartoum, or whether the intention of such an advance\r\n    was to be abandoned altogether. If the first plan were adopted,\r\n    Lord Wolseley declared his power and intention to take Berber, and\r\n    even gave a possible date for it, in the middle of March. The\r\n    cabinet, adopting the phrase which Lord Wolseley had used, decided\r\n    upon the facts as they then stood before it: (_a_) Lord Wolseley\r\n    was to calculate upon proceeding to Khartoum after the hot season,\r\n    to overthrow the power of the Mahdi there; (_b_) and,\r\n    consequently, on this decision, they were to commence the\r\n    construction of a railway from Suakin to Berber, in aid of the\r\n    contemplated expedition; (_c_) an expedition was also to be sent\r\n    against Osman Digna, which would open the road to Berber; but Lord\r\n    Wolseley’s demand for this expedition applied alike to each of the\r\n    two military alternatives which he had laid before the cabinet.\r\n\r\n    There was no absolute decision to proceed to Khartoum at any time;\r\n    and the declarations of ministers in parliament have treated it as\r\n    a matter to be further weighed; but all steps have thus far been\r\n    taken to prepare for it, and it has been regarded as at least\r\n    probable. In approaching the question whether we are still to\r\n    proceed on the same lines, it is necessary to refer to the motives\r\n    which under the directions of the cabinet were stated by Lord\r\n    Granville and by me, on the 19th of February, as having\r\n    contributed to the decision, I copy out a part of the note from\r\n    which he and I spoke:—\r\n\r\n    Objects in the Soudan which we have always deemed fit for\r\n    consideration as far as circumstances might allow:—\r\n\r\n    1. The case of those to whom Gordon held himself bound in honour.\r\n\r\n    2. The possibility of establishing an orderly government at\r\n    Khartoum.\r\n\r\n    3. Check to the slave trade.\r\n\r\n    4. The case of the garrisons.\r\n\r\n    A negative decision would probably have involved the abandonment\r\n    at a stroke of all these objects. And also (we had to consider)\r\n    whatever dangers, proximate or remote, in Egypt or in the East\r\n    might follow from the triumphant position of the Mahdi; hard to\r\n    estimate, but they may be very serious.\r\n\r\n    Two months, which have passed since the decision of the government\r\n    (Feb. 5), have thrown light, more or less, upon the several points\r\n    brought into view on the 19th February. 1. We have now no\r\n    sufficient reason to assume that any of the population of Khartoum\r\n    felt themselves bound to Gordon, or to have suffered on his\r\n    account; or even that any large numbers of men in arms perished in\r\n    the betrayal of the town, or took his part after the enemy were\r\n    admitted into it. 2. We have had no tidings of anarchy at\r\n    Khartoum, and we do not know that it is governed worse, or that\r\n    the population is suffering more, than it would be under a Turkish\r\n    or Egyptian ruler. 3. It is not believed that the possession of\r\n    Khartoum is of any great value as regards the slave trade. 4. Or,\r\n    after the failure of Gordon with respect to the garrisons, that\r\n    the possession of Khartoum would, without further and formidable\r\n    extensions of plan, avail for the purpose of relieving them. But\r\n    further, what knowledge have we that these garrisons are unable to\r\n    relieve themselves? There seems some reason to believe that the\r\n    army of Hicks, when the action ceased, fraternised with the\r\n    Mahdi’s army, and that the same thing happened at Khartoum. Is\r\n    there ground to suppose that they are hateful unless as\r\n    representatives of Egyptian power? and ought they not to be\r\n    released from any obligation to present themselves in that\r\n    capacity?\r\n\r\n    With regard to the larger question of eventual consequences in\r\n    Egypt or the East from the Mahdi’s success at Khartoum, it is open\r\n    to many views, and cannot be completely disposed of. But it may be\r\n    observed—1. That the Mahdi made a trial of marching down the Nile\r\n    and speedily abandoned it, even in the first flush of his success.\r\n    2. That cessation of operations in the Soudan does not at this\r\n    moment mean our military inaction in the East. 3. That the\r\n    question is one of conflict, not with the arms of an enemy, but\r\n    with Nature in respect of climate and supply. 4. There remains\r\n    also a grave question of justice, to which I shall revert.\r\n\r\n    Should the idea of proceeding to Khartoum be abandoned, the\r\n    railway from Suakin, as now projected, would fall with it, since\r\n    it was adopted as a military measure, subsidiary to the advance on\r\n    Khartoum. The prosecution of it as a civil or commercial\r\n    enterprise would be a new proposal, to be examined on its merits.\r\n\r\n    The military situation appears in some respects favourable to the\r\n    re-examination of the whole subject. The general has found himself\r\n    unable to execute his intention of taking Berber, and this failure\r\n    alters the basis on which the cabinet proceeded in February, and\r\n    greatly increases the difficulty of the autumn enterprise. On the\r\n    one hand Wolseley’s and Graham’s forces have had five or six\r\n    considerable actions, and have been uniformly victorious. On the\r\n    other hand, the Mahdi has voluntarily retired from Khartoum, and\r\n    Osman Digna has been driven from the field, but cannot, as Graham\r\n    says, be followed into the mountains.(325) While the present\r\n    situation may thus seem opportune, the future of more extended\r\n    operations is dark. In at least one of his telegrams, Wolseley has\r\n    expressed a very keen desire to get the British army out of the\r\n    Soudan.(326) He has now made very large demands for the autumn\r\n    expedition, which, judging from previous experience and from\r\n    general likelihood, are almost certain to grow larger, as he comes\r\n    more closely to confront the very formidable task before him;\r\n    while in his letter to Lord Hartington he describes this affair to\r\n    be _the greatest __“__since 1815,__”_ and expresses his hope that\r\n    all the members of the cabinet clearly understand this to be the\r\n    case. He also names a period of between two or three years for the\r\n    completion of the railway, while he expresses an absolute\r\n    confidence in the power and resources of this country with vast\r\n    effort to insure success. He means without doubt military success.\r\n    Political success appears much more problematical.\r\n\r\n    There remains, however, to be considered a question which I take\r\n    to be of extreme importance. I mean the moral basis of the\r\n    projected military operations. I have from the first regarded the\r\n    rising of the Soudanese against Egypt as a justifiable and\r\n    honourable revolt. The cabinet have, I think, never taken an\r\n    opposite view. Mr. Power, in his letter from Khartoum before\r\n    Gordon’s arrival, is decided and even fervent in the same sense.\r\n\r\n    We sent Gordon on a mission of peace and liberation. From such\r\n    information as alone we have possessed, we found this missionary\r\n    of peace menaced and besieged, finally betrayed by some of his\r\n    troops, and slaughtered by those whom he came to set free. This\r\n    information, however, was fragmentary, and was also one-sided. We\r\n    have now the advantage of reviewing it as a whole, of reading it\r\n    in the light of events, and of some auxiliary evidence such as\r\n    that of Mr. Power.\r\n\r\n    I never understood how it was that Gordon’s mission of peace\r\n    became one of war. But we knew the nobleness of his philanthropy,\r\n    and we trusted him to the uttermost, as it was our duty to do. He\r\n    never informed us that he had himself changed the character of the\r\n    mission. It seemed strange that one who bore in his hands a\r\n    charter of liberation should be besieged and threatened; but we\r\n    took everything for granted in his favour, and against his\r\n    enemies; and we could hardly do otherwise. Our obligations in this\r\n    respect were greatly enhanced by the long interruption of\r\n    telegraphic communication. It was our duty to believe that, if we\r\n    could only know what he was prevented from saying to us,\r\n    contradictions would be reconciled, and language of excess\r\n    accounted for. We now know from the letters of Mr. Power that when\r\n    he was at Khartoum with Colonel de Coetlogon before Gordon’s\r\n    arrival, a retreat on Berber had been actually ordered; it was\r\n    regarded no doubt as a serious work of time, because it involved\r\n    the removal of an Egyptian population;(327) but it was deemed\r\n    feasible, and Power expresses no doubt of its accomplishment.(328)\r\n    As far as, amidst its inconsistencies, a construction can be put\r\n    on Gordon’s language, it is to the effect that there was a\r\n    population and a force attached to him, which he could not remove\r\n    and would not leave.(329) But De Coetlogon did not regard this\r\n    removal as impracticable, and was actually setting about it. Why\r\n    Gordon did not prosecute it, why we hear no more of it from Power\r\n    after Gordon’s arrival, is a mystery. Instructed by results we now\r\n    perceive that Gordon’s title as governor-general might naturally\r\n    be interpreted by the tribes in the light of much of the language\r\n    used by him, which did not savour of liberation and evacuation,\r\n    but of powers of government over the Soudan; powers to be used\r\n    benevolently, but still powers of government. Why the Mahdi did\r\n    not accept him is not hard to understand, but why was he not\r\n    accepted by those local sultans, whom it was the basis of his\r\n    declared policy to re-invest with their ancient powers, in spite\r\n    of Egypt and of the Mahdi alike? Was he not in short interpreted\r\n    as associated with the work of Hicks, and did he not himself give\r\n    probable colour to this interpretation? It must be borne in mind\r\n    that on other matters of the gravest importance—on the use of\r\n    Turkish force—on the use of British force—on the employment of\r\n    Zobeir—Gordon announced within a very short time contradictory\r\n    views, and never seemed to feel that there was any need of\r\n    explanation, in order to account for the contradictions. There is\r\n    every presumption, as well as every sign, that like fluctuation\r\n    and inconsistency crept into his words and acts as to the\r\n    liberation of the country; and this, if it was so, could not but\r\n    produce ruinous effects. Upon the whole, it seems probable that\r\n    Gordon, perhaps insensibly to himself, and certainly without our\r\n    concurrence, altered the character of his mission, and worked in a\r\n    considerable degree against our intentions and instructions.\r\n\r\n    There does not appear to be any question now of the security of\r\n    the army, but a most grave question whether we can demonstrate a\r\n    necessity (nothing less will suffice) for making war on a people\r\n    who are struggling against a foreign and armed yoke, not for the\r\n    rescue of our own countrymen, not for the rescue _so far as we\r\n    know_ of an Egyptian population, but with very heavy cost of\r\n    British life as well as treasure, with a serious strain on our\r\n    military resources at a most critical time, and with the most\r\n    serious fear that if we persist, we shall find ourselves engaged\r\n    in an odious work of subjugation. The discontinuance of these\r\n    military operations would, I presume, take the form of a\r\n    suspension _sine die,_ leaving the future open; would require\r\n    attention to be paid to defence on the recognised southern\r\n    frontier of Egypt, and need not involve any precipitate\r\n    abandonment of Suakin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHome Rule Bill, 1886. (Page 308)\r\n\r\n\r\n(M196) _The following summary of the provisions of the Home Rule bill of\r\n1886 supplements the description of the bill given in Chapter V. Book\r\nX._:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    One of the cardinal difficulties of all free government is to make\r\n    it hard for majorities to act unjustly to minorities. You cannot\r\n    make this injustice impossible but you may set up obstacles. In\r\n    this case, there was no novelty in the device adopted. The\r\n    legislative body was to be composed of two orders. The first order\r\n    was to consist of the twenty-eight representative peers, together\r\n    with seventy-five members elected by certain scheduled\r\n    constituencies on an occupation franchise of twenty-five pounds\r\n    and upwards. To be eligible for the first order, a person must\r\n    have a property qualification, either in realty of two hundred\r\n    pounds a year, or in personalty of the same amount, or a capital\r\n    value of four thousand pounds. The representative peers now\r\n    existing would sit for life, and, as they dropped off, the crown\r\n    would nominate persons to take their place up to a certain date,\r\n    and on the exhaustion of the twenty-eight existing peers, then the\r\n    whole of the first order would become elective under the same\r\n    conditions as the seventy-five other members.\r\n\r\n    The second order would consist of 206 members, chosen by existing\r\n    counties and towns under the machinery now operative. The two\r\n    orders were to sit and deliberate together, but either order could\r\n    demand a separate vote. This right would enable a majority of one\r\n    order to veto the proposal of the other. But the veto was only to\r\n    operate until a dissolution, or for three years, whichever might\r\n    be the longer interval of the two.\r\n\r\n    The executive transition was to be gradual. The office of viceroy\r\n    would remain, but he would not be the minister of a party, nor\r\n    quit office with an outgoing government. He would have a privy\r\n    council; within that council would be formed an executive body of\r\n    ministers like the British cabinet. This executive would be\r\n    responsible to the Irish legislature, just as the executive\r\n    government here is responsible to the legislature of this country.\r\n    If any clause of a bill seemed to the viceroy to be _ultra vires_,\r\n    he could refer it to the judicial committee of the privy council\r\n    in London. The same reference, in respect of a section of an Irish\r\n    Act, lay open either to the English secretary of state, or to a\r\n    suitor, defendant, or other person concerned.\r\n\r\n    Future judges were to hold the same place in the Irish system as\r\n    English judges in the English system; their office was to be\r\n    during good behaviour; they were to be appointed on the advice of\r\n    the Irish government, removable only on the joint address of the\r\n    two orders, and their salaries charged on the Irish consolidated\r\n    fund. The burning question of the royal Irish constabulary was\r\n    dealt with provisionally. Until a local force was created by the\r\n    new government, they were to remain at the orders of the lord\r\n    lieutenant. Ultimately the Irish police were to come under the\r\n    control of the legislative body. For two years from the passing of\r\n    the Act, the legislative body was to fix the charge for the whole\r\n    constabulary of Ireland.\r\n\r\n    In national as in domestic housekeeping, the figure of available\r\n    income is the vital question. The total receipts of the Irish\r\n    exchequer would be £8,350,000, from customs, excise, stamps,\r\n    income-tax, and non-tax revenue. On a general comparison of the\r\n    taxable revenues of Ireland and Great Britain, as tested more\r\n    especially by the property passing under the death duties, the\r\n    fair proportion due as Ireland’s share for imperial purposes, such\r\n    as interest on the debt, defence, and civil charge, was fixed at\r\n    one-fifteenth. This would bring the total charge properly imperial\r\n    up to £3,242,000. Civil charges in Ireland were put at £2,510,000,\r\n    and the constabulary charge on Ireland was not to exceed\r\n    £1,000,000, any excess over that sum being debited to England. The\r\n    Irish government would be left with a surplus of £404,000. This\r\n    may seem a ludicrously meagre amount, but, compared with the total\r\n    revenue, it is equivalent to a surplus on our own budget of that\r\n    date of something like five millions.\r\n\r\n    The true payment to imperial charges was to be £1,842,000 because\r\n    of the gross revenue above stated of £1,400,000 though paid in\r\n    Ireland in the first instance was really paid by British consumers\r\n    of whisky, porter, and tobacco. This sum, deducted from\r\n    £3,342,000, leaves the real Irish contribution, namely £1,842,000.\r\n\r\n    A further sum of uncertain, but substantial amount, would go to\r\n    the Irish exchequer from another source, to which we have now to\r\n    turn. With the proposals for self-government were coupled\r\n    proposals for a settlement of the land question. The ground-work\r\n    was an option offered to the landlords of being bought out under\r\n    the terms of the Act. The purchaser was to be an Irish state\r\n    authority, as the organ representing the legislative body. The\r\n    occupier was to become the proprietor, except in the congested\r\n    districts, where the state authority was to be the proprietor. The\r\n    normal price was to be twenty years’ purchase of the net rental.\r\n    The most important provision, in one sense, was that which\r\n    recognised the salutary principle that the public credit should\r\n    not be resorted to on such a scale as this merely for the benefit\r\n    of a limited number of existing cultivators of the soil, without\r\n    any direct advantage to the government as representing the\r\n    community at large. That was effected by making the tenant pay an\r\n    annual instalment, calculated on the gross rental, while the state\r\n    authority would repay to the imperial treasury a percentage\r\n    calculated on the net rental, and the state authority would pocket\r\n    the difference, estimated to be about 18 per cent. on the sum\r\n    payable to the selling landlord. How was all this to be secured?\r\n    Principally, on the annuities paid by the tenants who had\r\n    purchased their holdings, and if the holdings did not satisfy the\r\n    charge, then on the revenues of Ireland. All public revenues\r\n    whatever were to be collected by persons appointed by the Irish\r\n    government, but these collectors were to pay over all sums that\r\n    came into their hands to an imperial officer, to be styled a\r\n    receiver-general. Through him all rents and Irish revenues\r\n    whatever were to pass, and not a shilling was to be let out for\r\n    Irish purposes until their obligations to the imperial exchequer\r\n    had been discharged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn The Place Of Italy. (Page 415)\r\n\r\n\r\n    By the provisions of nature, Italy was marked out for a\r\n    conservative force in Europe. As England is cut off by the\r\n    channel, so is Italy by the mountains, from the continental\r\n    mass.... If England commits follies they are the follies of a\r\n    strong man who can afford to waste a portion of his resources\r\n    without greatly affecting the sum total.... She has a huge free\r\n    margin, on which she might scrawl a long list of follies and even\r\n    crimes without damaging the letterpress. But where and what is the\r\n    free margin in the case of Italy, a country which has contrived in\r\n    less than a quarter of a century of peace, from the date of her\r\n    restored independence, to treble (or something near it) the\r\n    taxation of her people, to raise the charge of her debt to a point\r\n    higher than that of England, and to arrive within one or two short\r\n    paces of national bankruptcy?...\r\n\r\n    Italy by nature stands in alliance neither with anarchy nor with\r\n    Caesarism, but with the cause and advocates of national liberty\r\n    and progress throughout Europe. Never had a nation greater\r\n    advantages from soil and climate, from the talents and\r\n    dispositions of the people, never was there a more smiling\r\n    prospect (if we may fall back upon the graceful fiction) from the\r\n    Alpine tops, even down to the Sicilian promontories, than that\r\n    which for the moment has been darkly blurred. It is the heart’s\r\n    desire of those, who are not indeed her teachers, but her friends,\r\n    that she may rouse herself to dispel once and for ever the evil\r\n    dream of what is not so much ambition as affectation, may\r\n    acknowledge the true conditions under which she lives, and it\r\n    perhaps may not yet be too late for her to disappoint the\r\n    malevolent hopes of the foes of freedom, and to fulfil every\r\n    bright and glowing prediction which its votaries have ever uttered\r\n    on her behalf.—_“__The Triple Alliance and Italy’s Place in\r\n    it__”__ (Contemporary Review, Oct. 1889)._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Glasgow Peroration. (Page 492)\r\n\r\n\r\n_After describing the past history of Ireland as being for more than five\r\nhundred years ’one almost unbroken succession of political storm and\r\nswollen tempest, except when those tempests were for a time interrupted by\r\na period of servitude and by the stillness of death,’ Mr. Gladstone went\r\non_:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Those storms are in strong contrast with the future, with the\r\n    present. The condition of the Irish mind justifies us in\r\n    anticipating. It recalls to my mind a beautiful legend of ancient\r\n    paganism—for that ancient paganism, amongst many legends false and\r\n    many foul, had also some that were beautiful. There were two\r\n    Lacedæmonian heroes known as Castor and Pollux, honoured in their\r\n    life and more honoured in their death, when a star was called\r\n    after them, and upon that star the fond imagination of the people\r\n    fastened lively conceptions; for they thought that when a ship at\r\n    sea was caught in a storm, when dread began to possess the minds\r\n    of the crew, and peril thickened round them, and even alarm was\r\n    giving place to despair, that if then in the high heavens this\r\n    star appeared, gradually and gently but effectually the clouds\r\n    disappeared, the winds abated, the towering billows fell down to\r\n    the surface of the deep, calm came where there had been uproar,\r\n    safety came where there had been danger, and under the beneficent\r\n    influence of this heavenly body the terrified and despairing crew\r\n    came safely to port. The proposal which the liberal party of this\r\n    country made in 1886, which they still cherish in their mind and\r\n    heart, and which we trust and believe, they are about now to carry\r\n    forward, that proposal has been to Ireland and the political\r\n    relations of the two countries what the happy star was believed to\r\n    be to the seamen of antiquity. It has produced already\r\n    anticipations of love and good will, which are the first fruits of\r\n    what is to come. It has already changed the whole tone and temper\r\n    of the relations, I cannot say yet between the laws, but between\r\n    the peoples and inhabitants of these two great islands. It has\r\n    filled our hearts with hope and with joy, and it promises to give\r\n    us in lieu of the terrible disturbances of other times, with their\r\n    increasing, intolerable burdens and insoluble problems, the\r\n    promise of a brotherhood exhibiting harmony and strength at home,\r\n    and a brotherhood which before the world shall, instead of being\r\n    as it hitherto has been for the most part, a scandal, be a model\r\n    and an example, and shall show that we whose political wisdom is\r\n    for so many purposes recognised by the nations of civilised Europe\r\n    and America have at length found the means of meeting this oldest\r\n    and worst of all our difficulties, and of substituting for\r\n    disorder, for misery, for contention, the actual arrival and the\r\n    yet riper promise of a reign of peace.—_Theatre Royal, Glasgow,\r\n    July 2, 1892._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Naval Estimates Of 1894.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M197) _The first paragraph of this memorandum will be found on p. 508_:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    This might be taken for granted as to 1854, 1870, and 1884. That\r\n    it was equally true in my mind of 1859 may be seen by any one who\r\n    reads my budget speech of July 18, 1859. I defended the provision\r\n    as required by and for the time, and for the time only. The\r\n    occasion in that year was the state of the continent. It was\r\n    immediately followed by the China war (No. 3) and by the French\r\n    affair (1861-2), but when these had been disposed of economy\r\n    began; and, by 1863-4, the bulk of the new charge had been got rid\r\n    of.\r\n\r\n    There is also the case of the fortifications in 1860, which would\r\n    take me too long to state fully. But I will state briefly (1) my\r\n    conduct in that matter was mainly or wholly governed by regard to\r\n    peace, for I believed, and believe now, that in 1860 there were\r\n    only two alternatives; one of them, the French treaty, and the\r\n    other, war with France. And I also believed in July 1860 that the\r\n    French treaty must break down, unless I held my office. (2) The\r\n    demand was reduced from nine millions to about five (has this been\r\n    done now?) (3) I acted in concert with my old friend and\r\n    colleague, Sir James Graham. We were entirely agreed.\r\n\r\n    _Terse figures of new estimates_\r\n\r\n    The “approximate figure” of charge involved in the new plan of the\r\n    admiralty is £4,240,000, say 4-½ millions. Being an increase\r\n    (subject probably to some further increase in becoming an act)\r\n\r\n    1. On the normal navy estimate 1888-9 (_i.e._ before the Naval\r\n    Defence Act) of, in round numbers, 4-¼ millions\r\n\r\n    2. On the first year’s total charge under the Naval Defence Act of\r\n    (1,979,000), 2 millions\r\n\r\n    3. On the estimates of last year 1893-94 of 3 millions\r\n\r\n    4. On the total charge of 1893-4 of (1,571,000), 1-½ million\r\n\r\n    5. On the highest amount ever defrayed from the year’s revenue\r\n    (1892-3), 1-½ million\r\n\r\n    6. On the highest expenditure of any year under the Naval Defence\r\n    Act which included 1,150,000 of borrowed money, 359,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone’s Cabinet Colleagues.

Frere, on his return to England, once\r\n      more impressed on the colonial office the necessity of speedily\r\n      granting the Boers a constitution, otherwise there would be serious\r\n      trouble. (_Life_, ii. p. 408.)\r\n\r\n  M14 Boer Rising\r\n\r\n   19 Sir George Colley pressed Lord Kimberley in his correspondence with\r\n      the reality of this grievance, and the urgency of trying to remove\r\n      it. This was after the Boers had taken to arms at the end of 1880.\r\n\r\n   20 Before the Gladstone government came into office, between August\r\n      1879 and April 1880, whilst General Wolseley was in command, the\r\n      force in Natal and the Transvaal had been reduced by six batteries\r\n      of artillery, three companies of engineers, one cavalry regiment,\r\n      eleven battalions of infantry, and five companies of army service\r\n      corps. The force at the time of the outbreak was: in Natal 1772, and\r\n      in the Transvaal 1759—a total of 3531. As soon as the news of the\r\n      insurrection reached London, large reinforcements were at once\r\n      despatched to Colley, the first of them leaving Gibraltar on Dec.\r\n      27, 1880.\r\n\r\n   21 Sir B. Frere was recalled on August 1, 1880, and sailed for England\r\n      September 15. Sir Hercules Robinson, his successor, did not reach\r\n      the Cape until the end of January 1881. In the interval Sir George\r\n      Strahan was acting governor.\r\n\r\n  M15 Paragraph In The Royal Speech\r\n\r\n   22 Lord Kimberley justified this decision on the ground that it was\r\n      impossible to send a commissioner to inquire and report, at a moment\r\n      when our garrisons were besieged, and we had collected no troops to\r\n      relieve them, and when we had just received the news that the\r\n      detachment of the 94th had been cut off on the march from Lydenberg\r\n      to Pretoria. “Is it not practically certain,” he wrote, “that the\r\n      Boers would have refused at that time to listen to any reasonable\r\n      terms, and would have simply insisted that we should withdraw our\r\n      troops and quit the country?” Of course, the Boer overture, some six\r\n      weeks after the rejection by Lord Kimberley of the Cape proposal,\r\n      and after continued military success on the side of the Boers,\r\n      showed that this supposed practical certainty was the exact reverse\r\n      of certain.\r\n\r\n  M16 Boer Overtures\r\n\r\n   23 “I do not know whether I am indebted to you or to Mr. Childers or to\r\n      both, for the continuance of H.M.’s confidence, but I shall always\r\n      feel more deeply grateful than I can express; and can never forget\r\n      H.M.’s gracious message of encouragement at a time of great\r\n      trouble.”—Colley to Kimberley, Jan. 31, 1881.\r\n\r\n   24 “The directions to Colley,” says Mr. Bright in a cabinet minute,\r\n      “intended to convey the offer of a suspension of hostilities on both\r\n      sides, with a proposal that a commissioner should be appointed to\r\n      enter into negotiations and arrangements with a view to peace.”\r\n\r\n_   25 Life of Childers_, ii. p. 24.\r\n\r\n  M17 Repulse On Majuba Hill\r\n\r\n   26 Colley’s letter to Childers, Feb. 23, _Life of Childers_, ii. p. 24.\r\n\r\n  M18 Sir Evelyn Wood’s View\r\n\r\n   27 See Selborne’s _Memorials_, ii. p. 3, and also a speech by Lord\r\n      Kimberley at Newcastle, Nov. 14, 1899.\r\n\r\n   28 In a speech at Edinburgh (Sept. 1, 1884), Mr. Gladstone put the same\r\n      argument—“The people of the Transvaal, few in number, were in close\r\n      and strong sympathy with their brethren in race, language, and\r\n      religion. Throughout South Africa these men, partly British subjects\r\n      and partly not, were as one man associated in feeling with the\r\n      people of the Transvaal; and had we persisted in that dishonourable\r\n      attempt, against all our own interests, to coerce the Transvaal as\r\n      we attempted to coerce Afghanistan, we should have had the whole\r\n      mass of the Dutch population at the Cape and throughout South Africa\r\n      rising in arms against us.”\r\n\r\n   29 July 25, 1881.\r\n\r\n   30 One of the most determined enemies of the government in 1881, ten\r\n      years later, in a visit to South Africa, changed his mind. “The\r\n      Dutch sentiment in the Cape Colony, wrote Lord Randolph Churchill,\r\n      ’had been so exasperated by what it considered the unjust,\r\n      faithless, and arbitrary policy pursued towards the free Dutchmen of\r\n      the Transvaal by Frere, Shepstone, and Lanyon, that the final\r\n      triumph of the British arms, mainly by brute force, would have\r\n      permanently and hopelessly alienated it from Great Britain.... On\r\n      the whole, I find myself free to confess, and without reluctance to\r\n      admit, that the English escaped from a wretched and discreditable\r\n      muddle, not without harm and damage, but perhaps in the best\r\n      possible manner.”\r\n\r\n  M19 Case Considered\r\n  M20 The Sequel\r\n\r\n   31 “I apprehend, whether you call it a Protectorate, or a Suzerainty,\r\n      or the recognition of England as a Paramount Power, the fact is that\r\n      a certain controlling power is retained when the state which\r\n      exercises this suzerainty has a right to veto any negotiations into\r\n      which the dependent state may enter with foreign powers. Whatever\r\n      suzerainty meant in the Convention of Pretoria, the condition of\r\n      things which it implied still remains; although the word is not\r\n      actually employed, we have kept the substance. We have abstained\r\n      from using the word because it was not capable of legal definition,\r\n      and because it seemed to be a word which was likely to lead to\r\n      misconception and misunderstanding.”—_Lord Derby in the House of\r\n      Lords_, March 17, 1884. I do not desire to multiply points of\r\n      controversy, but the ill-starred raising of the ghost of suzerainty\r\n      in 1897-9 calls for the twofold remark that the preamble was struck\r\n      out by Lord Derby’s own hand, and that alike when Lord Knutsford and\r\n      Lord Ripon were at the colonial office, answers were given in the\r\n      House of Commons practically admitting that no claim of suzerainty\r\n      could be put forward.\r\n\r\n_   32 Works of T.

It is\r\n      a title which cabinet ministers do not possess. During thirty-eight\r\n      years since I first entered the cabinet, I have never known more\r\n      than a friendly announcement before publicity, and very partial\r\n      consultation perhaps with one or two, especially the leaders in the\r\n      second House.”\r\n\r\n  M41 Holiday At Cannes\r\n\r\n   68 See Appendix.\r\n\r\n   69 The lines from Lucretius (in his speech on the Affirmation bill).\r\n      See above, p. 19.\r\n\r\n   70 In a party sense, as he told the cabinet, it might be wise enough to\r\n      grant it, as it would please the public, displease the tories, and\r\n      widen the breach between the fourth party and their front bench. Mr.\r\n      Gladstone had suffered an unpleasant experience in another case, of\r\n      the relations brought about by the refusal of a political pension\r\n      after inquiry as to the accuracy of the necessary statement as to\r\n      the applicant’s need for it.\r\n\r\n  M42 Mr. Bright And The Irishmen\r\n\r\n   71 By an odd coincidence, on the day after my selection of this letter,\r\n      I read that the French prime minister, M. Combes, laid down the\r\n      doctrine that the government is never committed by a minister’s\r\n      individual declarations, but only by those of the head of the\r\n      government. He alone has the power of making known the direction\r\n      given to policy, and each minister individually has authority only\r\n      for the administration of his department (September 25, 1902). Of\r\n      course this is wholly incompatible with Mr. Gladstone’s ideas of\r\n      parliamentary responsibility and the cabinet system.\r\n\r\n  M43 Official Discipline\r\n  M44 Occupation Of Egypt\r\n\r\n   72 Many indications of this could be cited, if there were room. A\r\n      parade of the victors of Tel-el-Kebir through the streets of London\r\n      stirred little excitement. Two ministers went to make speeches at\r\n      Liverpool, and had to report on returning to town that references to\r\n      Egypt fell altogether flat.\r\n\r\n  M45 Egyptian Finance\r\n\r\n   73 Milner’s _England in Egypt_, p. 185.\r\n\r\n  M46 County Franchise\r\n\r\n_   74 Saturday Review_, April 12, 1884.\r\n\r\n  M47 Bill Rejected By The Lords\r\n\r\n   75 Edinburgh, August 30, 1884.\r\n\r\n   76 Corn Exchange, Edinburgh, August 30, 1884.\r\n\r\n  M48 Negotiation\r\n  M49 Negotiation And Persuasion\r\n\r\n   77 Dinner of the Eighty Club, July 11, 1884.\r\n\r\n  M50 The Queen’s Suggestion\r\n  M51 Conferences With Lord Salisbury\r\n  M52 The Question Settled\r\n  M53 Mr. Plunket’s Speech\r\n  M54 The Case Of Ireland\r\n\r\n   78 Lord Waterford, July 7, 1884.\r\n\r\n   79 December 11, 1883.\r\n\r\n   80 “I am not at all sure,” Mr. Forster rashly said (March 31, 1884),\r\n      “that Mr. Parnell will increase his followers by means of this\r\n      bill.”\r\n\r\n   81 This was only the second occasion on which his party in cardinal\r\n      divisions voted with the government.\r\n\r\n  M55 The Mahdi\r\n\r\n   82 Wingate, pp. 50, 51.\r\n\r\n   83 The Soudan was conquered in 1819 by Ismail Pasha, the son of Mehemet\r\n      Ali, and from that date Egypt had a more or less insecure hold over\r\n      the country. In 1870 Sir Samuel Baker added the equatorial provinces\r\n      to the Egyptian Soudan.\r\n\r\n   84 Mr. Gladstone said on Nov. 2, 1882: “It is no part of the duty\r\n      incumbent upon us to restore order in the Soudan. It is politically\r\n      connected with Egypt in consequence of its very recent conquest; but\r\n      it has not been included within the sphere of our operations, and we\r\n      are by no means disposed to admit without qualification that it is\r\n      within the sphere of our responsibility.” Lord Granville, May 7,\r\n      1883: “H.M. government are in no way responsible for the operations\r\n      in the Soudan, which have been undertaken under the authority of the\r\n      Egyptian government, or for the appointment or actions of General\r\n      Hicks.”\r\n\r\n  M56 Policy Of Evacuation\r\n  M57 Despatch Of Gordon\r\n\r\n   85 It was a general mistake at that time to suppose that wherever a\r\n      garrison fell into the hands of the Mahdi, they were massacred.

In 1874\r\n      he was appointed by the Egyptian government governor-general of the\r\n      equatorial provinces of central Africa. In 1876 he resigned owing to\r\n      trouble with the governor-general of the Soudan upon the suppression\r\n      of the slave trade, but was appointed (1877) governor-general of the\r\n      Soudan, Darfur, the equatorial provinces, and the Red Sea littoral.\r\n      He held this position till the end of 1879, suppressing the slave\r\n      trade with a strong hand and improving the means of communication\r\n      throughout the Soudan. He succeeded in establishing comparative\r\n      order. Then the new Egyptian government reversed Gordon’s policy,\r\n      and the result of his six years’ work soon fell to pieces.\r\n\r\n   88 Gordon’s Letters to Barnes, 1885.

He possesses great influence in the Soudan, and\r\n      General Gordon is of opinion that _circumstances might arise which\r\n      would render it desirable that he should be sent back to the\r\n      Soudan_.”\r\n\r\n  M62 Zobeir\r\n\r\n  100 (_From his diary._) _March 9._—...

As to the civilisation which the noble and gallant earl\r\n      [Lord Dundonald] would impose upon us the duty of restoring, it\r\n      could only be carried out by a large and costly expedition,\r\n      entailing enormous sacrifice of blood and treasure, and for the\r\n      present a continuous expenditure, which I do not think the people of\r\n      this country would sanction.... The defence of our retention of\r\n      Suakin is that it is a very serious obstacle to the renewal and the\r\n      conduct of that slave trade which is always trying to pass over from\r\n      Africa into Asia. I do not think that the retention of Suakin is of\r\n      any advantage to the Egyptian government. If I were to speak purely\r\n      from the point of view of that government’s own interest, I should\r\n      say, ‘Abandon Suakin at once.’ ”—Lord Salisbury, in the House of\r\n      Lords, March 16, 1888.\r\n\r\n  M71 A Historical Parallel\r\n\r\n  117 Above, vol. ii. p. 49.\r\n\r\n  118 Edinburgh, March 17, 1880.\r\n\r\n  119 In the letter to Mr. Bright (July 14, 1882) already given, Mr.\r\n      Gladstone went somewhat nearer to the Manchester school, and\r\n      expressed his agreement with Bright in believing most wars to have\r\n      been sad errors.\r\n\r\n  M72 The Vote Of Credit\r\n\r\n  120 West Calder, November 17, 1885.\r\n\r\n  M73 State Of Ireland\r\n  M74 Lord Randolph Churchill And The Irishmen\r\n\r\n  121 May 20, 1885.\r\n\r\n  122 The story was told by Lord R.

Mr. Gladstone also referred to the\r\n      case of the expulsion of the whigs by Peel. On May 13, 1841, after\r\n      eight nights’ debate, the government were defeated by a majority of\r\n      36 on their budget proposals in regard to sugar. Ministers not\r\n      resigning, Sir Robert Peel moved a vote of want of confidence on May\r\n      27, which was carried by a majority of 1 (312-311), June 4, 1841.\r\n      Parliament thereupon was dissolved.\r\n\r\n  M81 Ministerial Crisis\r\n\r\n  126 Memo. by Mr. Gladstone, on a sheet of notepaper, June 20, 1885.\r\n\r\n  M82 Crisis Prolonged\r\n\r\n  127 Mr. Gladstone was reminded by a colleague that when Sir Robert Peel\r\n      resumed office in 1845, at the request of the Queen, he did so\r\n      before and without consultation with his colleagues. In the end they\r\n      all, excepting Lord Stanley, supported him.\r\n\r\n  128 June 25, 1885.\r\n\r\n  129 The correspondence with the Queen up to June 21 was read by Mr.\r\n      Gladstone in the House of Commons on June 24, and Lord Salisbury\r\n      made his statement in the House of Lords on the next day. Mr.\r\n      Gladstone told the House of Commons that he omitted one or two\r\n      sentences from one of his letters, as having hardly any bearing on\r\n      the real points of the correspondence. The omitted sentences related\r\n      to the Afghan frontier, and the state of the negotiations with\r\n      Russia.\r\n\r\n  130 This proceeding was so unusual as to be almost without a precedent.\r\n      Lord Mulgrave had addressed the House of Lords in 1837, and Lord\r\n      Clarendon in 1850. But on each of these occasions the viceroy’s\r\n      administration had been the object of vigorous attack, and no one\r\n      but the viceroy himself was capable of making an effective\r\n      parliamentary defence.\r\n\r\n  131 July 6, 1885. _Hans._ 298, p. 1659.\r\n\r\n  M83 The Maamtrasna Debate\r\n\r\n  132 Sir M.

In inserting these two\r\n      letters, it may tend to prevent controversy if we print such\r\n      corrective hints as are desired.\r\n\r\n  138 In connection with a local government bill for small holdings and\r\n      allotments, subsequently passed.\r\n\r\n  139 He suggested, for instance, the appointment of a committee.\r\n\r\n  140 Mr. Chamberlain puts it that he proposed to exclude home rule as\r\n      impossible, and to offer a local government bill which he thought\r\n      that Parnell might accept. Mr. Gladstone’s statement that he and his\r\n      visitor were “pretty well agreed” on Ireland, cannot mean therefore\r\n      that the visitor was in favour of home rule.\r\n\r\n  141 This is not remembered.\r\n\r\n  142 “Some misunderstanding here.”\r\n\r\n  143 That is, in his seventy-sixth year.\r\n\r\n  M87 A Remarkable Interview\r\n\r\n  144 This episode was first mentioned in the House of Commons, June 7,\r\n      1886. Lord Carnarvon explained in the Lords, June 10. Mr. Parnell\r\n      replied in a letter to the _Times_, June 12. He revived the subject\r\n      in the House of Commons, Feb. 13, 1888, and Lord Carnarvon explained\r\n      a second time in the Lords on May 3. On Lord Carnarvon’s first\r\n      explanation, the Duke of Argyll, while placing the utmost reliance\r\n      on his personal honour and accuracy, “felt bound to observe that the\r\n      statement did not appear to be complete, for he had omitted to\r\n      explain what the nature of the communication [with Mr. Parnell]\r\n      absolutely was.” Neither then nor two years later was the omission\r\n      made good. Curiously enough on the first occasion Lord Carnarvon did\r\n      not even mention that Lord Salisbury in any way shared his\r\n      responsibility for the interview, and in fact his language pointed\r\n      the other way. What remains is his asseveration, supported by Lord\r\n      Salisbury, that he had made no formal bargain with Mr. Parnell, and\r\n      gave him no sort of promise, assurance, or pledge. This is not only\r\n      entirely credible, it is certain; for the only body that could carry\r\n      out such a promise had not been consulted. “I may at least say this\r\n      of what went on outside the cabinet—that I had no communication on\r\n      the subject, _no authorisation_, and that I never communicated to\r\n      them even that which I had done.”—_Hansard_, 306, p. 1258.\r\n\r\n_  145 E.g._ _Hans._ 306, pp. 1181, 1199.\r\n\r\n  146 Letter to the _Times_, June 12, 1886.\r\n\r\n  M88 A Remarkable Interview\r\n\r\n_  147 Hans._ 332, p. 336.\r\n\r\n  148 August 24, 1885.\r\n\r\n  M89 Lord Hartington And Mr. Chamberlain\r\n\r\n  149 Lord Hartington at Waterfoot, August 29.\r\n\r\n  150 June 17, 1885.\r\n\r\n  151 Warrington, September 8.\r\n\r\n  M90 Letter To Mr. Childers\r\n\r\n_  152 Life of Childers_, ii. p. 230.\r\n\r\n  153 Sept. 18, 1885.\r\n\r\n  154 Nov. 9, 1885.\r\n\r\n  155 Midlothian Speeches, p. 49.\r\n\r\n_  156 Ibid._ p. 39.\r\n\r\n  M91 Declarations From Lord Salisbury\r\n\r\n  157 Some of them are set out in Special Commission _Report_, pp. 99,\r\n      100.\r\n\r\n  158 See Mr. Gladstone upon these tactics in his fifth Midlothian speech,\r\n      Nov. 24, 1885.

I only glance at it\r\n      because in politics people are ready to believe anything. At the\r\n      general election of 1880, I had declined to support home rule. In\r\n      the press, however, I had strenuously opposed the Forster Coercion\r\n      bill of the following winter, as involving a radical misapprehension\r\n      of the nature and magnitude of the case. In the course of that\r\n      controversy, arguments pressed themselves forward which led much\r\n      further than mere resistance to the policy of coercion. Without\r\n      having had the advantage of any communication whatever with Mr.\r\n      Gladstone upon Irish subjects for some years before, I had still\r\n      pointed out to my constituents at Newcastle in the previous\r\n      November, that there was nothing in Mr. Gladstone’s electoral\r\n      manifesto to prevent him from proposing a colonial plan for Ireland,\r\n      and I had expressed my own conviction that this was the right\r\n      direction in which to look. A few days before the fall of the tory\r\n      government, I had advocated the exclusion of Irish members from\r\n      Westminster, and the production of measures dealing with the\r\n      land.—Speech at Chelmsford, January 7, 1886.\r\n\r\n  186 The cabinet was finally composed as follows:—\r\n\r\n      Mr. Gladstone, _First lord of the treasury_.\r\n      Lord Herschell, _Lord chancellor_.\r\n      Lord Spencer, _President of council_.\r\n      Sir W. Harcourt, _Chancellor of exchequer_.\r\n      Mr. Childers, _Home secretary_.\r\n      Lord Rosebery, _Foreign secretary_.\r\n      Lord Granville, _Colonial secretary_.\r\n      Lord Kimberley, _Indian secretary_.\r\n      Mr. Campbell-Bannerman, _War secretary_.\r\n      Lord Ripon, _Admiralty_.\r\n      Mr. Chamberlain, _Local government_.\r\n      Mr. Morley, _Irish secretary_.\r\n      Mr. Trevelyan, _Scotch secretary_.\r\n      Mr. Mundella, _Board of trade_.\r\n\r\n      The Lord chancellor, Mr. C.-Bannerman, Mr. Mundella, and myself now\r\n      sat in cabinet for the first time. After the two resignations at the\r\n      end of March, Mr. Stansfeld came in as head of the Local government\r\n      board, and we sat with the ominous number of thirteen at table.\r\n\r\n M108 On Procedure By Resolution\r\n\r\n  187 See Mr. Chamberlain’s speech, June 1, 1886. _Hans._ 306, p. 677.\r\n      Also Lord Hartington at Bradford, May 18, 1886.\r\n\r\n  188 June 1, 1833. _Hans._ 18, p. 186.\r\n\r\n  189 June 13, 1833. _Ibid._ p. 700.\r\n\r\n  190 May 14, 1833. _Hans._ 17, p. 1230.\r\n\r\n  191 There is also the case of the Reform bill of 1867. Disraeli laid\r\n      thirteen resolutions on the table. Lowe and Bright both agreed in\r\n      urging that the resolutions should be dropped and the bill at once\r\n      printed. A meeting of liberal members at Mr. Gladstone’s house\r\n      unanimously resolved to support an amendment setting aside the\r\n      resolutions. Disraeli at once abandoned them.\r\n\r\n M109 Two Branches Of The Policy\r\n\r\n  192 Lord Hartington’s argument on the second reading shows how a\r\n      resolution would have fared. _Hans._ 305, p. 610.\r\n\r\n_  193 Hans._ 304, p. 1116.\r\n\r\n_  194 Hans._ 304, p. 1190.\r\n\r\n M110 Important Resignations\r\n\r\n  195 Faint hopes were nourished that Mr. Bright might be induced to join,\r\n      but there was unfortunately no ground for them. Mr. Whitbread was\r\n      invited, but preferred to lend staunch and important support\r\n      outside. Lord Dalhousie, one of the truest hearts that ever was\r\n      attracted to public life, too early lost to his country, took the\r\n      Scottish secretaryship, not in the cabinet.\r\n\r\n M111 Mr. Parnell\r\n M112 The Bill On The Anvil\r\n\r\n  196 See Appendix.\r\n\r\n M113 Forces For And Against\r\n M114 Scene In Parliament\r\n M115 Character Of The Debate\r\n\r\n  197 First reading, April 13.

After some demur, the Irish secretary\r\n      consented, warning him of the damaging consequences of any premature\r\n      divulgation. The draft was duly returned, and not a word leaked out.\r\n      Some time afterwards Mr. Parnell recalled the incident to me. “Three\r\n      of the men to whom I showed the draft were newspaper men, and they\r\n      were poor men, and any newspaper would have given them a thousand\r\n      pounds for it. No very wonderful virtue, you may say.
