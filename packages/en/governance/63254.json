EARLY\r\n\r\n\r\n  PRESS OF\r\n  BROWN-MORRISON CO\r\n  LYNCHBURG, VA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEditor's Note\r\n\r\n\r\nA review is given, in the pages following, of the causes which led to\r\nthe political issue of the '60s; an issue which will be open to argument\r\nuntil, in all of its bearings, it becomes understood through familiarity\r\nwith the conditions of the past. Sentiment divorced from reason occasioned\r\nmisconception. Many causes contributed to that effect. The lack of\r\nauthentic records doubtless was one; certainly ill-advised publications\r\ninflamed, if they did not inspire, public opinion at this critical period.\r\n\r\nThe author was actuated by the desire to correct erroneous opinion in\r\nrelation to the South. His manuscript has lain unpublished during the\r\npassing of half a century, till passion having cooled and prejudice\r\nabated, there is no longer reason for clash from difference of feeling\r\nupon the subject.\r\n\r\nThe African slave trade began in the year 1442, when Anthony Gonsalez,\r\na Portuguese, took from the Gold Coast, ten negroes, which he carried\r\nto Lisbon. In 1481, the Portuguese built a fort on the Gold Coast, and\r\nas early as 1502, the Spaniards began to employ negroes in the mines of\r\nHispaniola. In 1517, Charles V, Emperor of Spain, granted a patent to\r\ncertain persons, for the supply of 4,000 negroes, annually, to the islands\r\nof Hispaniola, Cuba, Jamaica and Porto Rico. John Hawkins, afterwards\r\nknighted by Queen Elizabeth, got into his possession, partly by the sword\r\nand partly by other means, 300 negroes, and sold them in the West Indies.\r\nHawkins' second voyage was patronized by Queen Elizabeth, who participated\r\nin the profits; and in 1618, in the reign of James I, the British\r\ngovernment established a regular trade on the coast of Africa.\r\n\r\nWhen negotiations for the slave traffic were first agitated, the cost to\r\nthe victim seems not to have been considered. The white man's need--or\r\ngreed--demanded sacrifice. The negro, a product of the \"three-cornered\r\nrum, slave and molasses trade\" was brought to New England to a condition\r\noffering few advantages beyond certain comforts which were to be provided\r\nby the master who was to assume all the obligations of the position.\r\n\r\nWrenched from his home, separated from his people, exiled to a foreign\r\nland, which was governed by laws maintained through penalties, the\r\nenforced emigrant was set to labor in unaccustomed ways under uncongenial\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nThe experiment of settling him in a manufacturing section proved\r\ndisadvantageous to the investor. The demand for field labor furnished a\r\nSouthern market; this occasioned his removal to that part of the country,\r\nhis aptitude for the work kept him there.\r\n\r\nHis insurrectionary spirit made his training difficult. It was a trial of\r\nendurance for master as well as apprentice, but custom and good treatment\r\ntamed the wild nature of the latter and converted him into an important\r\nfactor in Southern industries; to this day none other has been found to\r\ntake his place in cotton or tobacco field.\r\n\r\nHe was also a form of property, and laws were made in that connection.\r\nThat instances of abuse on the part of the owner arose was axiomatic--such\r\nis the history of life in every sphere, and that was neither a Utopian age\r\nnor country.\r\n\r\nHaving served its aim, the slave trade diminished, then ceased. The\r\nattitude of those engaging in and encouraging it altered, the base\r\nof operations changed, and there remained only the people of the\r\nslave-holding states (upon whom now fell the responsibility of the\r\nsupport of these nation wards) with any reason for interest in the\r\nsubject. Perhaps it was inevitable that diverging interest should arise to\r\ncause the politics of the country to become affected through distrust of\r\nthose who owned that particular form of property.\r\n\r\nOriginally acquired as a necessity, the slave's value lessened and the\r\nburden on his master increased, as other interests divided his attention.\r\nLegislation was resorted to without success in the enactment of measures\r\nfor the abolishment of a system so firmly rooted.\r\n\r\nIn 1805, Mr. Jefferson wrote \"I have given up all expectation of any\r\nearly, provision for the extinguishment of slavery among us. There are\r\nmany virtuous men who would make any sacrifices to effect it, many equally\r\nvirtuous who believe it cannot be remedied.\" In 1814, however, Mr.\r\nJefferson again urged the policy of emancipation.\r\n\r\nThat many owners were in sympathy with this proposed disposition of a\r\nvexed problem, is manifest from the records of the courts, which show that\r\nslaves were sent to Liberia, settled in the free states, permitted to\r\npurchase their freedom, bequeathed land and liberty by the masters who had\r\nheld them.\r\n\r\nA strange condition existed in the holding of slaves by free negroes.\r\nThese were to be found in nearly all of the colonies and states where\r\nthere were slaves. In some counties they were numerous, while in others\r\nthey were unknown. In certain states this condition was at times forbidden\r\nby law, but often continued in spite of the law, tolerated or ignored; the\r\nlaws upon the subject also varied from time to time. In other states free\r\nnegroes were given the privilege of being masters by special statute or\r\nthis liberty was covered by general laws.\r\n\r\nCertain good was accomplished by the transportation of the African savage\r\nto a congenial clime among those who trained him to become a useful\r\ncitizen. Under the tutelage of his master, he was guided, stage by stage,\r\nalong the pathway to civilization by the law he recognized in his native\r\nland--that of coercion--till he attained his present status. Standing\r\nupon this vantage ground, it remains for him to work out his further\r\nadvancement and to discover the position he can maintain. In the fact that\r\nsome have made strides forward, and thus fitted themselves as leaders\r\nof the race, lies the hope and inspiration for the rest, an encouraging\r\nfactor being the imitative faculty with which many are gifted.\r\n\r\nCriticism today discovers that in the portrayal of the character of \"Uncle\r\nTom\" Mrs. Stowe paid a glowing tribute to the achievement of the Southern\r\nmaster. Africa has not done as much for the brother left upon her soil,\r\nnor has the foreign missionary. We may still read of such practices as\r\ncannibalism on the western coast of the dark continent--even along the\r\ntrail of the religious enthusiast. Taking then into account what has been\r\naccomplished, the claim that the Southern master was the most successful\r\nmissionary can easily be proved.\r\n\r\nWe have no doubt but that some cause other than the avarice of the white\r\nman led to the rescue of the man of color from a life of ignorance and\r\nbarbarism--to his expatriation to this country of opportunity--to his\r\nsettlement under apprenticeship calculated to encourage self-helpfulness\r\nby developing his capabilities. To this end he passed through the\r\nprobationary period of servitude.\r\n\r\nGeneral Early's review of the situation previous to the war, as here\r\npresented, illustrates the point of view of the people of the South. His\r\nattitude towards slavery took its color from his familiarity with the\r\ninstitution as it existed in the homes of those to whom it had become a\r\nnatural condition of life. It was so incorporated with their daily living,\r\nand with the traditions of generations, that they became accustomed to it\r\nwithout considering the reasons for its establishment.\r\n\r\nThe author was never an investor in slaves, although he always possessed\r\na negro servant. One who served till age enfeebled him, was retired\r\non a pension. Another, cut short in his service by fatal disease, was\r\nrespectfully followed to his last resting place by the master upon whom\r\nin health he had attended. His thoughtful care of his attendants and his\r\nliberality when trouble overtook them, won their affection and respect.\r\n\r\nIt may be understood then that interest in slaves as property did not\r\nenter into his defense of slavery as an institution of his country. No\r\nselfish thought prompted the use of his pen in the exposition of the\r\nunfairness of opinion abroad--but, imbued with a keen sense of right,\r\nhe was actuated by the desire to dissipate that injustice which took\r\npossession of many minds--coloring their views and proving barriers to\r\ntheir sympathies.\r\n\r\nTo make clear his point of view by stating the true conditions which\r\nbrought about slavery in the South and to define the relation which\r\nexisted between master and slave, was the purpose of General Early in\r\nwriting this real story of slavery as it was established in America, and\r\nas it continued to exist in that section of which it became the heritage.\r\n\r\n                                                              R.

The example of Spain in regard\r\nto the use of negro slaves in her American Colonies was followed by all\r\nthe other nations of Europe, who undertook the colonization of the newly\r\nfound continent and islands, to-wit: the Portuguese, English, French,\r\nDutch, Danes and Swedes.\r\n\r\nSir John Hawkins, an English admiral and adventurer, was the first\r\nEnglishman known to have engaged in the African slave trade, and he\r\ncarried his first cargo to the Spanish West India islands about the\r\nyear 1562. Report says that Queen Elizabeth became a partner in and\r\nshared the profits of his subsequent voyages in the prosecution of the\r\ntrade. From that time the African slave trade became a regular branch of\r\nEnglish commerce, and was conducted in its first stages principally under\r\nmonopolies granted to companies, in the profits of which members of the\r\nRoyal family, noblemen, courtiers and churchmen, as well as merchants,\r\nshared, as was the practice in those days in all important branches of\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nFrom the restriction under Charles II, the African trade, including that\r\nin slaves, was monopolized by the \"_Royal African Company_\" for a number\r\nof years; and that company built and established, on the coast of Africa,\r\nforts and factories for the purpose of facilitating and protecting the\r\ntrade; but in the year 1698, the slave trade was thrown open to private\r\ntraders, upon the payment to the company of a certain percentage towards\r\nthe support of its forts and factories.\r\n\r\nThe growing demand in Europe for colonial products now gave a new impulse\r\nto the slave trade, and its profits were very great. It was not only\r\nrecognized by the government, but was sustained by the universal public\r\nsentiment in England, and was fostered and cherished by Parliament as a\r\nlucrative traffic.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1713, by the treaty of Utrecht, the _Assiento_, a contract\r\noriginally entered into by the Spanish government with a company of French\r\nmerchants for a monopoly by the latter of the trade in slaves to Spanish\r\nAmerica, was assigned to the South Sea Company. By the terms of this\r\ncontract 4,800 negro slaves were to be furnished to the Spanish colonies\r\nannually for thirty years, the company being privileged to introduce as\r\nmany more as could be sold.\r\n\r\nIn this company Queen Anne and the King of Spain became stockholders, as\r\ndid a large portion of the nobility, gentry, churchmen, and merchants\r\nof England. England thus sought a monopoly of the entire slave trade,\r\nat least so far as her own and the Spanish colonies were concerned. The\r\nexclusive privileges granted to the Royal African Company having expired,\r\nin the year 1750 the British Government undertook to maintain the forts\r\nand factories on the African coast at its own expense, and the slave trade\r\nwas thrown open to free competition on the part of its citizens. A great\r\nincrease of the trade now took place, and England had become the leading\r\nnation in that trade, which was carried on chiefly from the ports of\r\nBristol and Liverpool, but other ports including that of London shared in\r\nit--the West Indies furnishing the principal market, but a considerable\r\nnumber were also introduced into the colonies of North America.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Puritan settlers in New England, under the allurements\r\nof the high profits of the trade, had been tempted to engage in it from\r\nthe time of the earliest settlements there, which they did by evading\r\nthe monopolies and restrictions in favor of English merchants, and as\r\nNew England rum was mainly used in the traffic, by the Puritans, the\r\nParliament of Great Britain had, at the instance of English merchants,\r\npassed an act, called the \"Molasses Act\" imposing duties on molasses,\r\nsugar and rum imported into the colonies from the French and Dutch West\r\nIndies, for the purpose of preventing interference with the English trade\r\nin slaves.\r\n\r\nNumerous acts of the colonial legislatures imposing duties on the\r\nimportation of slaves, had also been vetoed or repealed by royal\r\nproclamation, because they were regarded and styled \"impediments to\r\nBritish commerce not to be favoured,\" and all such acts continued to be\r\nvetoed and repealed down to the time of the American Revolution, except\r\nin the solitary case of Virginia, when, after repeated acts imposing such\r\nduties had been vetoed or repealed, privilege was finally given to the\r\ncolonial legislature in 1734, to impose a duty to be paid by the colonial\r\n_purchaser_ and not the English _seller_.\r\n\r\nBut it was not by fostering the slave trade and prosecuting any\r\nrestrictions on it, only, that the British government made itself\r\nresponsible for African slavery in its American colonies. In the year 1730\r\nseven of the principal Cherokee Chiefs from the unsettled country west\r\nof South Carolina, were carried to England by Sir Alexander Cumming, and\r\nwhile there they were induced to enter into a treaty with the Board of\r\nTrade then having charge of colonial affairs, by which provision was made\r\nfor the return to their owners, by the Indians, of all runaway slaves; and\r\nin the year 1732, an act of parliament was passed \"for the more speedy\r\nrecovery of debts in America\" by English creditors, among the provisions\r\nof which was one subjecting slaves to execution in judgments for all\r\ndemands. While England thus became so identified with the introduction of\r\nAfrican slavery into America, all the commercial nations of Europe were\r\nlikewise implicated in the trade; and if England took the lead in it, that\r\nfact was owing to the superior intelligence and energy of her merchants\r\nand traders, and not to any qualms of conscience on the part of other\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nIn fact during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, until towards the close\r\nof the latter, when a very few \"philanthropists\" appeared, there was no\r\nsentiment in any Christian or unchristian country which regarded the\r\nreduction of the negroes of Africa to slavery as opposed to moral right or\r\nreligious duty, or in any other light than as a blessing to the negroes\r\nthemselves and a great benefit to their owners.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact, not undeserving of notice, in reviewing the conduct of\r\nEngland in forcing African slaves upon her American colonies, that during\r\nthe whole period from the settlement to the revolt of those colonies, all\r\ntrade with them to and from Ireland was absolutely forbidden, and hence it\r\nis that the Irish formed so inconsiderable an element in their population\r\nprevious to the Revolution. The native Irish were then regarded by their\r\nrulers as having but few more rights than the negroes of Africa.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving thus briefly shown the origin and progress of the slave trade, I\r\nwill now trace the settlement of the colonies, which afterwards became the\r\nUnited States, and the introduction of slavery into them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n=Origin of Slavery in the United States=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first permanent settlement within the limits of the United States--as\r\nthey became afterwards--to be established, was that of Florida, which\r\nwas begun by the Spaniards in the year 1564. Slavery was introduced into\r\nFlorida, as it was into all the Spanish colonies, and that colony remained\r\nunder the control of Spain until the year 1763, when it was ceded to Great\r\nBritain, at the close of the war which resulted in the cession of Canada,\r\nand the territory east of the Mississippi by France to the same power, but\r\nin 1783, after the recognition of the independence of the United States,\r\nFlorida along with that part of Louisiana east of the Mississippi and\r\nsouth of the 31st degree of latitude, which had been ceded by France, was\r\nre-ceded to Spain, and remained a Spanish colony until the year 1821, when\r\nit was ceded to the United States; slavery continuing to exist there under\r\nall these changes.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next permanent settlement in point of time, was that of Virginia by\r\nthe English in the year 1607. In the year 1620, twenty negro slaves were\r\nbrought to Jamestown in Virginia by a Dutch man-of-war and sold to the\r\ncolonists, but the number of slaves in that colony remained so small\r\nfor a long time, that there was no legislative enactment recognizing\r\nthe existence of slavery for more than forty years after the first\r\nintroduction of it.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of Indians to slavery was prohibited in Virginia from the\r\nbeginning, and in the year 1658 by the revised laws adopted in that\r\ncolony, the Indians were protected in the possession of their lands, and\r\nin order to secure the Indian children, placed with the colonists for\r\neducation, from being sold as slaves, the transfer of their service was\r\nforbidden. In the revised code adopted in 1662, very humane provisions\r\nwere contained for the protection of the Indians, in the enjoyment of\r\ntheir lands, and it was enacted that no Indians entertained as servants\r\nshould be sold into slavery for a longer period than English indented\r\nservants of like age. In the same year, the first act was passed by the\r\ncolonial legislature recognizing the existence of slavery, and it was to\r\nthe effect that children should be held as bond or free \"according to the\r\ncondition of the mothers.\"\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis law recognized the generally received principle that slavery was\r\nvalid according to the laws of nations, but did not itself enact slavery.\r\nThat principle prevailed universally, all over the world at that time, and\r\nhad prevailed since the foundation, being recognized in the bible.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the year 1667, a law was passed providing that negro slaves converted\r\nand baptized should not thereby become free. The motive for the adoption\r\nof this law, was to secure to slaves religious instruction, as an idea\r\nprevailed among some that it was not lawful to hold a Christian in\r\nslavery, and it was apprehended that masters might be indisposed, under\r\nsuch impressions, to encourage their slaves to become converted. In the\r\nsame year it was provided by law that \"all servants, not being Christians,\r\nimported by shipping shall be slaves for life.\"\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1671, there were in Virginia, according to a statement furnished by\r\nGovernor Berkeley, 40,000 inhabitants, including in that number 2,000\r\n\"black slaves\" and 6,000 Christian servants. The latter consisted of\r\nEnglish servants brought into the colony as indented servants for a term\r\nof years, and sold--as was the practice in all of the colonies at that\r\nday--to pay the expenses of their passage.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring what was known as Bacon's rebellion in 1676, the Virginia Assembly,\r\nacting under the coercion of Bacon's followers, passed an act for the\r\nprosecution of a war against the Indians, and one of its provisions was\r\nthat all Indians taken prisoners in war should be held and accounted\r\nslaves for life. This was the first and only provision of the laws of that\r\ncolony authorizing the reduction of Indians to slavery, though Indian\r\nslaves, not being Christians, brought in by shipping might be held, under\r\nthe law of 1667; but there were no slaves made under this forced enactment\r\nof Bacon's, as the war was not prosecuted, the rebellion having come to an\r\nend, by the death of its leader, the same year.\r\n\r\nA law was enacted in the year 1682, by which negroes, Moors, mulattoes\r\nor Indians, brought into the colony as servants, by sea or land, were\r\nrecognized as slaves \"whether converted to Christianity or not, provided\r\nthey were not of Christian parentage or country, or Turks or Moors in\r\namity with his majesty.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1692, an act was passed providing for \"a free and open\r\ntrade for all persons, at all times and at all places with all Indians\r\nwhatsoever,\" under which the Virginia courts decided that no Indian could\r\nbe reduced to slavery, or brought into Virginia as a slave, after the\r\npassage of the act.\r\n\r\nIn the revised Code of Virginia, adopted in the year 1705, is contained\r\nthe final enactment upon the subject of slavery during the colonial state,\r\nexcept some acts imposing duties on imported slaves, and by that enactment\r\nit was provided that \"all servants imported or brought into this country\r\nby sea or land, who were not Christians in their native country (except\r\nTurks and Moors in amity with his majesty, and others who can make due\r\nproof of their being free in England or any other Christian country\r\nbefore they were shipped in order to transportation thither) shall be\r\naccounted and be slaves, notwithstanding a conversion to Christianity\r\nafterwards\"; and it was further provided--as in the first act on the\r\nsubject--for \"all children to be bond or free according to the condition\r\nof their mothers.\"\r\n\r\nThe Virginia Assembly had passed, from time to time, acts imposing a duty\r\nof twenty shillings a head on all imported slaves, and this being renewed\r\nin 1723, was repealed by royal proclamation, but the Board of Trade\r\nin England intimated that they had no objection to a duty on imported\r\nnegroes, provided it was exacted from the colonial purchaser, and not from\r\nthe English seller; and in 1734 an act was passed imposing a duty of five\r\nper cent. to be paid by the purchaser, which was subsequently increased\r\nand reached as high as twenty per cent.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1772, the House of Burgesses of Virginia adopted an address\r\nto George III, declaring the importation of negroes from Africa to be an\r\ninhuman trade and asking that all restraints be removed from the passage\r\nof acts to check \"that pernicious commerce,\" which request was not granted.\r\n\r\nAfter the commencement of the difficulties which led to the Revolution,\r\nthe Virginia convention, which assembled the 1st of August, 1774, and\r\ntook upon itself the actual management of the affairs of the colony,\r\nadopted among its first acts, a resolution to import \"no more slaves, nor\r\nBritish goods, nor tea.\" Practically this resolution put an end forever\r\nto the African slave trade so far as Virginia was concerned, and its\r\nabolition was subsequently confirmed during the war of the Revolution by\r\na more formal act passed by the legislature in the year 1778, prohibiting\r\nthe importation of slaves from any quarter, whether by sea or land,\r\nand providing that all brought into the State in violation of the law\r\nshould be free. Slaves brought in by citizens of other of the United\r\nStates coming into Virginia as actual residents, and those inherited by\r\ncitizens of Virginia in other States of the Union and brought in by them\r\nbeing exempted from the operation of the act. In addition to the grant\r\nof freedom to the slaves themselves heavy penalties were imposed on both\r\nthe buyer and seller who violated the act. In adopting this prohibition,\r\nVirginia was ahead of all the States in the Union except the little State\r\nof Delaware, and its action preceded the abolition of the slave trade, by\r\nEngland, thirty years.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Virginia had never engaged in the slave trade as\r\nimporters, and were merely the purchasers from others--its legislature\r\nbeing prohibited from interfering with the trade.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1610, trading posts were established by the Dutch within\r\nthe present limits of New York, and the name of New Netherland was given\r\nto the territory claimed, including that of New York, New Jersey, or the\r\nJersey, and some other. Actual colonization began within the present\r\nlimits of New York, under the authority of the Dutch government in the\r\nyear 1629, the traders located in those limits having been previously\r\nengaged only in trade with the Indians. Slavery was introduced with the\r\nfirst settlers and was recognized and protected by law. In the year\r\n1664, New Netherland was conquered from its Dutch rulers, by an English\r\nexpedition under the authority of the Duke of York, subsequently James\r\nII, to whom a royal grant of the territory had been made. The province of\r\nNew York was then created out of New Netherland, though it came again,\r\ntemporarily, under the Dutch for portions of the years 1673 and 1674.\r\n\r\nSlavery was continued as it before existed until after the Revolution.\r\nVessels were fitted out in the port of New York (first called New\r\nAmsterdam), for the slave trade at an early period, and the merchants of\r\nthat city engaged in it without scruple; some of them continued to be so\r\nengaged until the traffic was prohibited by Congressional enactment.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe settlement next in point of time was that of Plymouth, in the year\r\n1620, within the present limits of the State of Massachusetts. Slavery\r\nof the Indians and also of negroes existed in this province from the\r\nbeginning. The settlement at Plymouth by the passengers of the May Flower,\r\nthough first in point of time, was not by any means, the leading one\r\nin Massachusetts, and the Province of Plymouth played comparatively an\r\nunimportant part in the history of Massachusetts. The main settlement in\r\nthat colony was made in the year 1629, by John Winthrop and his followers,\r\nPuritans emigrating directly from England, professedly for the purpose of\r\nsecuring to themselves, and their posterity, religious freedom. It was\r\nthis settlement which gave tone and character to Massachusetts, as well as\r\nto all the other New England provinces, which were chiefly offshoots from\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nThough professing to be seeking a home in this wilderness for the\r\npurpose of enjoying and establishing religious liberty, the settlers of\r\nMassachusetts established as proscriptive and despotic a theocracy as\r\nthe world has ever seen. A celebrated humorist has aptly said that their\r\nidea of religious liberty consisted in enjoying their own opinions to the\r\nfullest extent and preventing any body else from enjoying theirs.\r\n\r\nUnder their charter a government was established by the colonists at\r\nMassachusetts Bay, which was entirely theocratic in form and substance.\r\nTo be a freeman, that is a citizen and voter, it was necessary to be a\r\nmember of the established church, which was the Congregational, and was\r\nsupported at the public expense. The members of that church claimed to be\r\nGod's elect, and they showed no mercy to any other sect and allowed of no\r\ndissent whatever; all others were heretics or heathens.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, the colonists at Massachusetts Bay, as well as those\r\nat Plymouth, regarded the \"heathen around them\" and all their possessions\r\nas fit spoil for the \"Saints.\" Accordingly they began at a very early\r\nperiod to help themselves. In the year 1637, in a war begun against the\r\nPiquods, that tribe of Indians was exterminated by slaughter and capture.\r\nOf several hundred prisoners taken, the adult males, constituting but a\r\nsmall portion of the captives, were sent to the West Indies and sold into\r\nslavery, while the women and children were distributed among the colonists\r\nas slaves also; this was done by the constituted authorities.\r\n\r\nThese colonists commenced the building of ships in the year 1634, and\r\nengaged in commerce, the African slave trade, being, from the beginning,\r\na part of that commerce. By the year 1640, six large vessels had been\r\nbuilt, and fitted out by the Boston merchants, which were sent on voyages\r\nto Spain, Madeira and the Canaries with cargoes of fish and staves, and\r\nbrought back, among other things, cargoes of negroes from the coast of\r\nAfrica for sale at Barbadoes and the other British West India Islands.\r\n\r\nIt was not a great while before the religious persecution in Massachusetts\r\ndrove off a number of dissenters from the established faith, among them\r\nbeing the celebrated Roger Williams, the founder of the Baptists in\r\nAmerica. These \"heretics,\" as they were called, took refuge within the\r\npresent limits of Rhode Island, where they established, at different\r\npoints, separate governments for themselves, all of which were\r\nsubsequently merged in that of Rhode Island. Emigrants from Massachusetts\r\nalso established themselves at different points in the present limits of\r\nConnecticut and formed two separate governments, one called New Haven\r\nand the other Connecticut, which were afterwards united under that of\r\nConnecticut. Massachusetts set up a claim of jurisdiction over all of\r\nthese settlements, but finally had to abandon it.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1641, the general court of Massachusetts, in which the\r\nlegislative power was vested, adopted a code of fundamental laws called\r\n\"Fundamentals\" or \"Body of Liberties,\" which were compiled from two\r\nseparate drafts reported by those \"Godly ministers,\" \"the great Cotton\" as\r\nhe was called, and Nathaniel Ward, who had been appointed commissioners\r\nfor that purpose. One of the \"Liberties\" provided that \"There shall never\r\nbe any bond-slavery, villanage nor captivity among us, unless it be\r\nlawful captives taken in just wars, and such strangers as willingly sell\r\nthemselves or are sold unto us, and these shall have all the liberties\r\nand Christian usages which the law of God, established in Israel,\r\nrequires. This exempts none from servitude who shall be judged thereto by\r\nauthority.\" This surely was a one-sided idea of religious liberty; the\r\n\"elect\" gave themselves abundant liberty to do as they pleased in the\r\nmatter. This \"Fundamental\" was twenty years in advance of any legislative\r\nenactment in Virginia recognizing the existence of slavery.\r\n\r\nA confederacy was formed, in the year 1643, between the colonies of\r\nMassachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut and New Haven, called the \"United\r\nColonies of New England\" into which the \"heretics\" of Rhode Island were\r\nnot permitted to enter. Slavery existed by law everywhere now in New\r\nEngland, including Rhode Island, and one of the stipulations of the\r\ncompact, by which the United Colonies were bound, was that fugitive\r\nservants or slaves should be delivered up when fleeing from one province\r\nto another. The stipulation was almost in the identical terms of that long\r\nafterwards incorporated into the United States Constitution upon the same\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe harsh treatment pursued towards dissenters, including the most\r\ndelicate females, who were sometimes stripped naked and whipped through\r\nthe streets, and the trials and execution of persons as witches, furnish\r\nrevolting details of the conduct of the \"elect,\" but it is not intended\r\nto refer more particularly to that here. One fact, however, in regard to\r\nthe history of Virginia and Massachusetts may be properly mentioned--as\r\ndescendants of the latter's colonists have arraigned at the bar of public\r\nopinion, the people of Virginia, as well as the whole South upon the\r\nsubject of slavery--and that fact is very suggestive.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1644, the Indians in Virginia, under the instigation of\r\nOpechancanough, successor of Powhatan, undertook to exterminate the\r\ncolonists in that province, when five hundred persons, who were engaged\r\nin celebrating a victory of the king over the Parliamentary army in the\r\nwar then raging, were massacred at the first surprise. A ship was sent to\r\nBoston to procure powder for the defence of the colony, but the general\r\ncourt declined to furnish it. This refusal was owing to the fact that the\r\npeople of Virginia sympathized with the king in the pending struggle, and\r\nto the further fact that three ministers sent out from New England at the\r\ninstance of some of the \"elect,\" who had found their way into Virginia,\r\nwere sent out of the province by Governor Berkeley for violating the\r\nlaw--Governor Winthrop declaring that the massacre of the Virginians was a\r\npunishment \"for their reviling the Gospel and those faithful ministers.\"\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA law was adopted in Connecticut, 1650, for selling debtors for debt,\r\nwhich remained in force more than a century and a half; and at the same\r\ntime a law was adopted, upon the recommendation of the commissioners for\r\nthe United Colonies of New England, providing that Indians refusing or\r\nneglecting satisfaction for injuries might be seized and delivered to the\r\nparty injured \"either to serve, or to be shipped out and exchanged for\r\nnegroes, as the case will justly bear.\" About this time, the \"heretics\"\r\nat Warwick, one of the settlements in Rhode Island, complained that\r\nthe authorities of Massachusetts had instigated the Indians to commit\r\ndepredations upon them, and Easton, subsequently governor of Rhode Island,\r\nwas reported to have said of the people of Massachusetts, that \"the\r\nelect had the Holy Ghost and the devil indwelling.\" Upon hearing of the\r\nexecution of two persons for witchcraft, the people of Warwick exclaimed\r\n\"There are no witches on earth, nor devils, but the ministers of New\r\nEngland and such as they.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1676, a large number of captives, taken in the war against King Philip,\r\nin which all of New England was united, were made slaves of, many of them\r\nwere sent from Boston to Bermuda and sold, including the infant son of\r\nKing Philip, who, some of the most prominent ministers insisted, should\r\nbe slain for his father's sins, though the more remunerative expedient of\r\nselling him was adopted. The captives who fell into the hands of the Rhode\r\nIslanders were distributed as slaves, and Roger Williams, the expelled\r\n\"heretic\" from Massachusetts, received a boy for his share. A large body\r\nof Indians assembled at Dover, at the conclusion of the war, to make\r\npeace, were treacherously captured and some two hundred of them were sent\r\nto Boston, where some were hung and the rest shipped off to be sold as\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of James II, the charter of Massachusetts was vacated\r\nby legal proceedings, and in the year 1691, a new charter was issued\r\nproviding for the appointment of the governor by the crown and for\r\ntoleration to all religious sects. This gave great dissatisfaction to\r\nthe ruling church; and the theocratic power was in a great measure\r\ndestroyed, but the controlling influence of the old religious party still\r\nprevailed in the general court, though restrained by the royal governor.\r\nBy this charter the province of Plymouth was incorporated with that of\r\nMassachusetts, as was the district of Maine, but New Hampshire, previously\r\nunder the government of Massachusetts, was soon created into a separate\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nIn 1701, the town of Boston instructed its representatives to propose\r\n\"putting a period to negroes being slaves,\" but no action was taken, and\r\nthese scruples were very short lived, the enslaving of Indians and the\r\nprosecution of the slave trade being still continued. The manufacture of\r\nNew England rum, which was in progress, furnished a very easy means of\r\nprosecuting the trade, as that article was freely exchanged on the coast\r\nof Africa with the natives for slaves. One part of the inhabitants being\r\nimbruited by the detestable liquor, while the other was carried off into\r\nbondage. The traders of New England, composed of all classes, including\r\nchurch dignitaries, participated largely in the profits resulting from the\r\nimpulse given to the slave trade in 1698, and it was sustained by public\r\nsentiment in those colonies as well as in the mother country.\r\n\r\nIn 1704, in the intercolonial war with Canada, Massachusetts offered a\r\nreward of $66 per head for Indian prisoners under ten years of age and\r\ndouble as much for older prisoners or for scalps.\r\n\r\nIn 1712, Massachusetts passed an act prohibiting the further importation\r\nof Indian slaves on pain of the forfeiture of the slaves, but this\r\nprohibition did not arise from feelings of humanity for the Indians;\r\nthe reasons given for it were, that the Indians were \"of a surly and\r\nrevengeful spirit, rude and insolent in their behavior, and very\r\nungovernable\" and because \"this province being differently circumstanced\r\nfrom the plantations in the islands, and having great numbers of the\r\nIndian natives of the country within and about them and at this time under\r\nthe sorrowful effects of their rebellion and hostilities.\"\r\n\r\nThe merchants of England having complained that the New Englanders were\r\ninfringing upon their rights by engaging in the slave trade, which the\r\nNew England traders now mainly carried on with rum, for the manufacture\r\nof which molasses was imported from elsewhere than the British West India\r\nIslands, an act of Parliament was passed in 1733, imposing a duty on\r\nmolasses, sugar and rum imported from the French and Dutch West Indies.\r\nThis act was called the \"Molasses Act,\" and was the first of the series\r\nof Acts bringing about the discontent which led to the Revolution. The\r\ntraders of New England managed to elude this act as they had done the\r\nrestrictions put upon the slave trade for the benefit of the English\r\nmerchants. The manufacture of rum and the trade from all the ports of New\r\nEngland still continued with great activity up to the commencement of the\r\nRevolution, and served to build up the commerce of that section, as the\r\nsame trade had built up the commerce of the mother country.\r\n\r\nSome slaves were imported into all the New England colonies, but as there\r\nwas not very profitable employment for them there, and it was vastly\r\nmore remunerative to sell than to work them, the former was preferred to\r\nthe latter mode of dealing with the subject and in it they found a rich\r\nreward. The markets for the slaves were found in the West Indies and in\r\nthe Southern colonies, where the soil, climate and productions were\r\nmuch more suitable for African slave labor, than in the cold regions of\r\nthe north. There were, however, in the year 1754, 2,448 negro slaves in\r\nMassachusetts over 16 years of age, 1,000 of them being in Boston, and\r\nthe whole number exceeded 4,000, while in Connecticut and Rhode Island\r\nthe proportion of slaves to the white population was greater than in\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMaryland was settled under the proprietorship of Lord Baltimore in the\r\nyear 1634, and slavery was introduced into that colony also, the laws\r\nrecognizing and regulating it being very similar to those of Virginia. In\r\n1649, an act was passed by which the kidnapping of Indians to make them\r\nslaves, was made felony, and in 1663, the first act recognizing slavery\r\nwas passed, being similar in its features to that of Virginia. The people\r\nof Maryland did not engage in the slave trade and were merely purchasers.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first settlement in the Carolinas was within the limits of what became\r\nSouth Carolina, and was made in the latter half of the 16th century by\r\nFrench Huguenots, but that settlement proved a failure. An attempt to make\r\na settlement in North Carolina under the auspices of Sir Walter Raleigh\r\nalso proved abortive. The first permanent settlement in North Carolina\r\nwas by Virginia emigrants to the northern part of it, some years previous\r\nto the charter, which was granted to some English noblemen and others\r\nfor both of the Carolinas. In 1665, North Carolina was taken possession\r\nof under this charter, and a government was established therefor. In\r\n1670, South Carolina was permanently settled. Though embraced in the same\r\ncharter, North and South Carolina now became separate provinces with\r\ndistinct governments. Slavery was introduced into both provinces and was\r\nrecognized by law; the number of slaves continuing to increase as the\r\npopulation increased and the capacities of the soil became known, which\r\nproved to be very suitable for slave labor. There was nothing special in\r\nthe history of slavery in these provinces during the colonial state. The\r\npeople did not engage in the slave trade, but were merely purchasers from\r\nEnglish and New England traders; nor did they make slaves of the Indians\r\nby whom they were surrounded.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first settlers within the limits of New Jersey were Swedes, who came\r\nover prior to 1630. New Jersey, or East and West Jersey as it was called\r\nthen, was settled in 1665 by English emigrants, and two governments\r\nwere organized therefor under grants from the Duke of York, which were\r\nsubsequently consolidated into one. Slavery was introduced into that\r\nprovince as it had been in all of the others, but the number of slaves did\r\nnot become as numerous as in the more Southern colonies, because the soil\r\nand climate were not as suitable for slave labor.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPennsylvania was settled in 1682 under the proprietorship of William Penn,\r\nand the government was organized by him, including within its jurisdiction\r\nDelaware also. Slavery was introduced into this colony, and slaves were\r\nheld without scruple by the Quaker followers of Penn. In 1692, George\r\nKeith, a Scotch Quaker who had been the champion of the Quakers against\r\ntheir persecutors--the Reverend Cotton Mather of witch notoriety, and the\r\nother Massachusetts divines--attacked negro slavery as inconsistent with\r\nQuaker principles. For this he was \"_disavowed_\" by the yearly meeting\r\nof the Quakers of Pennsylvania, as a schismatic, and he instituted a\r\nmeeting of his own called \"Christian Quakers.\" For publishing a reply\r\nto a publication against him, he was fined by the Quaker magistrates of\r\nPhiladelphia and he subsequently became disgusted with the whole sect,\r\nturned Episcopalian, went to England and took orders there, and was one of\r\nthe first missionaries sent to the American colonies by the \"Society for\r\npropagating the gospel in foreign parts.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1699, Penn proposed to provide by law for the marriage, religious\r\ninstruction and kind treatment of slaves, but he met with no response from\r\nthe Quaker legislature of Pennsylvania. The \"spirit\" had not then moved\r\nthe Quakers to \"bear their testimony\" against slavery and consequently\r\nthey did not \"testify.\" In 1712, the legislature imposed a duty of £20\r\non all negroes and Indians brought into the province by land or water, a\r\ndrawback to be allowed in case of re-exportation within twenty days, and\r\nslaves brought in and concealed were to be sold. This act did not owe its\r\norigin to abhorrence of slavery itself, but was passed in a fright at some\r\nalleged plots for insurrections, which were apprehended in consequence\r\nof one which had been discovered in New York. The act was disallowed by\r\nQueen Anne, and the same legislature replied to a petition in favor of\r\nemancipating the negroes, \"That it was neither just nor expedient to set\r\nthem at liberty.\" This was the only \"testimony\" borne by the Quakers of\r\nPennsylvania against slavery prior to the war of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDelaware was originally settled by Swedes at the same time the settlement\r\nwas made in New Jersey, and it had been embraced under the same government\r\nwith Pennsylvania at the time of Penn's settlement, but it was made a\r\nseparate province, by his consent, in the year 1691. Delaware is entitled\r\nto the credit of being not only the first of the provinces but the first\r\ncountry in the world to adopt an express enactment prohibiting the\r\nintroduction of slaves within its limits. This it did in the year 1771,\r\nbut the act was vetoed by Governor Penn, the grandson of Wm. Penn, and\r\nthe representative of the crown. The prohibition was incorporated into the\r\nfirst State Constitution adopted in the year 1776. Delaware was, however,\r\na slave colony and remained a slave State.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first permanent settlement within the limits of the territory of\r\nLouisiana, which embraced a very large tract of country, was made under\r\nthe auspices of D'Ibberville, a French Canadian, at Mobile, within the\r\nlimits of the present State of Alabama in the year 1702. Bienville,\r\ngovernor of Louisiana, located New Orleans, the first permanent settlement\r\nwithin the limits of the State of Louisiana, in the year 1718. Slavery\r\nwas introduced into the province of Louisiana under the direction of the\r\nFrench government, a contract being made for that purpose with Anthony\r\nCrozat, a French merchant, to whom the province and a monopoly of its\r\ntrade were granted. Crozat resigned his patent in 1717, and a monopoly\r\nof the trade for twenty-five years was granted to \"the company of the\r\nWest,\" commonly called \"The Mississippi Company,\" with which the famous\r\nLaw was connected. By its contract, the company undertook to introduce\r\n6,000 whites and half as many negro slaves into the province. Slavery\r\nthus became established in Louisiana under the express stipulation of\r\nthe French government, and continued to exist under its authority. In\r\n1763, by the treaty made between England, France and Spain, at the close\r\nof the war in which all three nations had been engaged, France ceded to\r\nEngland, Canada and all of the territory east of the Mississippi river,\r\nexcept the island of Orleans, and to Spain all of Louisiana which had not\r\nbeen ceded to England, while Spain ceded Florida to England. In 1783,\r\nEngland re-ceded Florida to Spain, and at the same time ceded to the same\r\npower that part of Louisiana north of the 31st degree of latitude which\r\nhad been acquired from France. The parts of the original province of\r\nLouisiana thus re-united, remained a Spanish province until the year 1801,\r\nwhen it was re-ceded to France, and in 1803 it was ceded to the United\r\nStates. Slavery had continued to exist in the province, and the different\r\nparts of it, and to be recognized as legal, during all of these changes.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1733, Georgia was settled under the patronage of General Oglethorpe,\r\nof the British Army, and it was intended as a humanitarian scheme for\r\nfurnishing refuge to impoverished meritorious persons, and persecuted\r\nContinental Protestants. The territory, together with the power to\r\nlegislate for twenty-one years, was granted to trustees resident in\r\nEngland. The trustees at first prohibited the introduction of slaves,\r\nbut under the humanitarian ideas with which the colony was begun, it\r\nlanguished and proved a miserable failure until the year 1749. The\r\ntrustees were then induced to permit the introduction of slaves, at\r\nthe instance, among others, of the celebrated preacher, Whitfield,\r\nand his follower, Habersham, who earnestly interceded for the\r\npermission--Habersham stating as a reason for the introduction of slavery\r\nthat \"Many of the poor slaves in America have already been made freemen of\r\nthe Heavenly Jerusalem.\"\r\n\r\nSlavery was thus introduced into Georgia, and the Colony began at once to\r\nprosper and advanced with rapid strides.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe institution of slavery, it will thus be perceived, existed at the time\r\nof the Revolution, not only in all of the revolting colonies, acknowledged\r\nby law and sustained by public sentiment at home and in the mother\r\ncountry, but it existed in all of the territories, which afterwards became\r\na part of the United States, and was sanctioned by the sentiment of all of\r\nthe Christian world.\r\n\r\nBut before this review of the slave trade and of slavery in the British\r\ncolonies in North America, is closed, it is proper that England should\r\nreceive credit for one incident in her judicial history in regard to the\r\nsubject. In the year 1763, the celebrated case of Somerset, a slave who\r\nhad been carried to England by his master from one of the British West\r\nIndia Islands, came up before Lord Mansfield in Westminster Hall on a writ\r\nof _habeas corpus_, and that distinguished Chief Justice of the King's\r\nBench, in delivering his opinion discharging the petition, said: \"The air\r\nof England has long been too pure for a slave, and every man who breathes\r\nit is free.\"\r\n\r\nThis declaration is the source of much pride to Englishmen and Lord\r\nCampbell in his \"Lives of the Chief Justices\" goes into ecstasies over\r\nit. It is regarded as the enunciation of the great principle that the\r\ncommon law of England establishes universal freedom, and that wherever\r\nit prevails it knocks the shackles from the slave and turns him loose,\r\na free man. Yet it was most probable that Somerset himself, and it was\r\ncertain that his ancestor, if not himself, had been carried from Africa,\r\nin a ship that had been fitted out under the protection of that very\r\ncommon law by men breathing that same pure air, and sold into slavery in a\r\ncolony to which the same law under which he was released, had followed the\r\ncolonists. Was ever so absurd a farce enacted as that which was enacted\r\nby the Chief Justice of England, when he announced in Westminster Hall\r\nbefore the assembled bar of London, that the air breathed by a nation of\r\nslave-traders was too pure for the slave himself. None but an Englishman\r\nwould have failed to discover its absurdity. Where then, was that \"genius\r\nof universal emancipation\" referred to at a later period at the Irish Bar\r\nby Curran, in such eloquent language, that it did not waft these words on\r\nthe wings of that pure air across the channel to the Emerald Isle, to the\r\ncoasts of Africa, to the plantations of America and the West Indies, or to\r\nthe banks of the Ganges? Could not a breath of that pure air be afforded\r\nat least for the ships of the British Navy, then so sedulously guarding\r\nEnglish slave ships through the horrors of the \"Middle Passage\" from\r\nFrench cruisers? No! that pure air was \"fixed air\" which could not extend\r\nbeyond the shores of England, and the wings of the \"genius of universal\r\nemancipation\" were so clipped that it was a more clumsy domestic bird than\r\nthe barnyard fowl.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that these celebrated words were uttered in Westminster\r\nHall, the ministers of State, and king, lords and commons in Parliament,\r\nwere cherishing with a fostering hand that very trade which had consigned\r\nSomerset to slavery, and was then consigning thousands upon thousands\r\nof his native countrymen to the same fate while the boasted navy of the\r\n\"Mistress of the Seas\" was escorting the human cargoes in safety and\r\ntriumph to their destination, and in the colonies writs and executions\r\nwere being issued, according to forms framed in Westminster Hall, to\r\nenforce from the sale of the bodies of human beings, the collection of\r\ndebts, due to men who breathed the \"pure air of England,\" and prided\r\nthemselves on the liberties of the common law.\r\n\r\nThis decision of Lord Mansfield was one of those acts of judicial\r\nlegislation for which he was so famous, and it was not the law. Quite as\r\nable judges as himself had previously decided the validity and legality\r\nof slavery even in England, and Lord Stowell, as able a judge and purer\r\nman than he was, subsequently ruled very differently from the decision in\r\nthe Somerset case. England had no use for slaves at home, as her toiling\r\nmillions supplied every demand for labor or service. Had it been to her\r\ninterest to have had African slaves within her own limits, her pure air\r\nwould have accommodated itself to their constitution. She never sacrificed\r\nher material interests to her philanthropy. Notwithstanding the decision\r\nof Lord Mansfield, it was twenty-five years before the prime minister of\r\nEngland (the younger Pitt) ventured to go even so far, as to bring in a\r\nbill to mitigate the horrors \"of the Middle Passage,\" by limiting the\r\nnumber of slaves to be taken on board a ship--it was forty-five years\r\nbefore another prime minister ventured to advocate the abolition of the\r\nslave trade, and seventy-one years before slavery was abolished in the\r\nlimited slave colonies left to England after the American Revolution, and\r\nthat was not done until this small interest was so far overshadowed by\r\nother interests as to make it of no importance to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n=Legislation on the Question of State Establishment=\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the status of the slave trade and slavery in the\r\nUnited States after their independence was achieved, it is necessary to\r\nglance at the progress of the Revolution and the adoption of the new form\r\nof government after its close.\r\n\r\nIn 1774, the contest between the mother country and the English Colonies\r\nof North America approached a crisis, and the first Continental Congress\r\nof delegates from the thirteen colonies assembled at Philadelphia on\r\nthe 5th of September of that year. Fifteen articles, as the basis of an\r\n\"American Association,\" were adopted and signed on the 20th of October,\r\nin which, among other things the slave trade was denounced, and entire\r\nabstinence from it and from any trade with those engaged in it, was\r\nenjoined. This had been preceded by the Virginia resolution on the same\r\nsubject more than two months, but the war which ensued put an end to the\r\ntrade during its continuance, much more effectually than any resolutions\r\nor laws could have done.\r\n\r\nThe \"Declaration of Colonial Rights\" adopted by this Congress enumerated\r\neleven acts of Parliament as having been passed in derogation of the\r\nrights of the colonies since the accession of George III to the throne,\r\nto-wit:\r\n\r\n1. \"The Sugar Act.\"--This act was a modification of the \"Molasses Act,\" by\r\nwhich the duties on molasses and sugar were lowered and a few unimportant\r\narticles were added to the list of those taxed.\r\n\r\n2. \"The Stamp Act.\"--This act never had been executed and had been\r\nrepealed.\r\n\r\n3 and 4. \"The Two Quartering Acts.\"--The first of these acts had been\r\npassed in 1765, after the close of the war against the French in Canada,\r\nwhich resulted in the conquest of that country from France, greatly\r\nto the advantage of the northern colonies. It was intended to quarter\r\ntroops on the colonies for their protection against the Indians and was\r\nin accordance with the views of the elder Pitt, who intimated that the\r\ncolonies ought to bear a portion of the burthen of a war made for their\r\nbenefit. By the terms of this act, the colonial authorities were required\r\nto furnish quarters, firewood, bedding, drink, soap, and candles to the\r\ntroops sent into the colonies. It had been resisted or evaded and had been\r\nallowed to expire.\r\n\r\nThe second of these acts was a re-enactment of the first, in consequence\r\nof the disturbance at Boston.\r\n\r\n5. \"The Tea Act.\"--This act imposed a duty of three pence a pound on\r\ntea imported into the colonies, and allowed a drawback of the duty of a\r\nshilling a pound on the tea imported into England, when re-shipped to the\r\ncolonies; the practical effect of which was to lower the duties paid by\r\nthe colonists.\r\n\r\n6. \"The Act Suspending the New York Legislature.\"--This act was passed in\r\nconsequence of the continued refusal of that legislature to comply with\r\nthe terms of the quartering acts.\r\n\r\n7 and 8. \"The Acts For the Trials in Great Britain of Offences Committed\r\nin America.\"--These acts were passed in consequence of the resistance of\r\nall British authority at Boston.\r\n\r\n9. \"The Boston Port Bill.\"--This act was passed in consequence of the\r\nforcible destruction of tea in Boston Harbor.\r\n\r\n10. \"The Act For Regulating the Government of Massachusetts.\"--This Act\r\nwas passed in consequence of the continuous disturbances by the people of\r\nthat colony.\r\n\r\n11. \"The Quebec Act.\"--This act was for the government of Canada, and the\r\nother colonies had no right to complain, except so far as it extended to\r\nthe country south of the lakes and west of those colonies.\r\n\r\nIt is well to keep these causes of complaint in mind, when considering the\r\ncauses for the secession of the Southern States previous to the late war,\r\nand the course pursued towards those States.\r\n\r\nIn the war which resulted from the resistance to the acts specified,\r\nwas involved a great principle of self-government, which the British\r\ngovernment has since fully acknowledged in the treatment of all her\r\nother colonies, but it must be confessed that there was a good deal of\r\nturbulence and violence exhibited by American colonists in the first\r\nstages of the contest. Without depreciating the public spirit displayed by\r\nthe people of Massachusetts during the war which ensued, there can be no\r\nquestion but that by violence and rashness the conflict was precipitated,\r\nand that much forbearance was show by some of the British military\r\nofficials. A candid review of the history of the difficulties preceding\r\nactual hostilities must lead any honest mind to the conclusion that while\r\nthe British ministers acted unconstitutionally and unwisely, as the\r\nquarrel approached its crisis, the people of Massachusetts, with whom the\r\nconflict began, exhibited a very turbulent spirit and often acted with\r\nunwarranted violence.\r\n\r\nThe settlers of Massachusetts, on account of their peculiar religious\r\ntheories, had from the very beginning, been impatient of all control from\r\nthe mother country and anxious to thrown it off. They had hailed the\r\nCommonwealth with joy, had been greatly chagrined at the restoration of\r\nthe royal authority and had been very much embittered by the vacation\r\nof their charter and the loss of the theocratic form of government, and\r\ntheir ministry kept alive the fires of discontent and fanned them into a\r\nflame on all occasions. The same feeling existed throughout New England.\r\nVirginia on the contrary had been always a loyal colony and had not\r\nacknowledged the Parliament or the Commonwealth in Cromwell's time, until\r\ncompelled to do so by a force sent for its conquest. Its people had hailed\r\nthe restoration with delight and there was no sentiment in the colony\r\ndemanding a separation from the mother country which was not engendered\r\nby actual or supposed infringement of their rights as British subjects.\r\nThough the people of that colony had little direct interest in the\r\ngrievances complained of against the British government, as the articles\r\ntaxed entered very little into their consumption, and no troops had been\r\nquartered among them in an offensive manner since the Parliamentary\r\nexpedition, they made common cause with the people of Massachusetts, as\r\nit was a question of power which involved the rights of all the colonies.\r\nThe difference was that the people of Massachusetts and New England were\r\nanxious to bring on a separation, while those of Virginia were not, unless\r\nit was necessary for the protection of the rights of all of the colonies.\r\nThe statesmen of Virginia entered warmly into the dispute both by speaking\r\nand writing, and when the actual collision took place the people sprang to\r\narms and sent to Massachusetts aid in both men and provisions.\r\n\r\nIt was the attempt to coerce the people of Massachusetts, in an\r\nunconstitutional manner, to compliance with unconstitutional laws, on the\r\npart of the British government, more than any actual grievances of their\r\nown, that aroused the people of Virginia to action, as that coercion if\r\nsuccessfully applied to one colony, might be used for the destruction of\r\nall self-government in the others. This became the traditional policy of\r\nVirginia as a sovereign State. After the struggle began, she gave a leader\r\nto the continental army, her wisest and best statesmen to the colonial\r\ncouncils, her arms-bearing citizens to the ranks, and her resources to the\r\nprosecution of the war. That war which was begun in Massachusetts, long\r\nafter it ceased to exist within the limits of that State, was finally,\r\npractically, ended on the soil of Virginia, after that soil had been\r\nterribly ravaged by the invading armies of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nMotives similar to those which actuated Virginia, prompted the action of\r\nall of the other Southern colonies, and none suffered greater losses in\r\nwar for the common defence than South Carolina. This statement is not made\r\nin order to claim for Virginia and the other Southern States more than\r\ntheir due share of credit for services in the war of the Revolution, nor\r\nto depreciate the valuable services rendered by the more northern states\r\nof the confederation.\r\n\r\nThe war was prosecuted by the colonies as a confederacy of sovereign\r\nStates. The Continental Congress was in fact but a congress of\r\ncommissioners or embassadors, whose acts derived their validity from the\r\ntacit adoption and sanction of the several States, and the delegates\r\nwere at all times subject to recall and substitution, by the appointment\r\nof others--a power which was repeatedly exercised. The Declaration\r\nof Independence itself, was made in accordance with powers expressly\r\ndelegated for that purpose to the representatives of the several\r\nappointing powers, and derived its force not from the action of Congress,\r\nbut from the adoption of that action by those represented in that body.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Virginia, her independence had been declared by a\r\nconvention of her own, and a State Government had been actually organized\r\nin advance of the action of Congress, and she was the first thus to\r\nassert her sovereignty. On the 15th of May, 1776, the Virginia convention\r\nresolved to adopt a bill of rights and frame a State government, and on\r\nthe 29th of June following, the government was put into operation by the\r\nelection of a governor and other officers--a Bill of Rights and State\r\nConstitution having been framed and adopted in the meantime.\r\n\r\nArticles of confederation were proposed in 1777, more than a year after\r\nthe adoption of the Declaration of Independence, for ratification by\r\nthe thirteen sovereign States. These articles required the unanimous\r\nratification of all of the States, and as Maryland withheld her consent\r\nto this, until the 1st of March, 1781, they did not go into effect until\r\nthat time. In the meanwhile the Congress had continued to exercise its\r\npermissive powers in the prosecution of the war, but it had no means of\r\nenforcing its edicts except in the voluntary compliance of the several\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe first three articles were as follows:\r\n\r\nArticle I. The style of this confederacy shall be \"The United States of\r\nAmerica.\"\r\n\r\nArt. II. \"Each State retains its sovereignty, freedom and independence,\r\nand every power, jurisdiction and right, which is not by this\r\nconfederation expressly delegated to the United States in Congress\r\nassembled.\"\r\n\r\nArt. III. \"The several States hereby severally enter into a firm league of\r\nfriendship with each other for their common defence, the security of their\r\nliabilities and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to\r\nassist each other against all force opposed to, or attacks made upon them,\r\nor any of them, on account of religion, sovereignty, trade or any other\r\npretence whatever.\"\r\n\r\nThe other articles of confederation conferred upon Congress very little\r\nmore power than it had been exercising. All important measures required\r\nthe concurrence of nine States, the votes being given by the delegates\r\nfrom each State as a unit, and not in their individual capacity.\r\n\r\nThe right of the States to recall their delegates and to appoint others\r\nwas expressly reserved, so that five States acting together, could at any\r\ntime block the government, and the latter had no means of enforcing its\r\ndecrees when made, but had to rely upon the voluntary compliance of the\r\nStates as before. It will thus be seen that the government organized under\r\nthe articles of confederation remained still a mere confederacy of several\r\nindependent States. When peace was finally made with Great Britain, that\r\npower recognized the sovereignty and independence of the several States\r\nof New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New\r\nJersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South\r\nCarolina and Georgia by name, and not the sovereignty and independence of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nAfter the treaty of peace, under the navigation laws of Great Britain,\r\nAmerican vessels trading with that country, were restricted to the\r\nimportation of products of the several States to which they belonged,\r\nwhich put those States upon the footing of so many separate nations.\r\n\r\nThe action of the several States upon the subject of slavery and the slave\r\ntrade during the war and afterwards to the time of the adoption of the\r\nConstitution of the United States was as follows:\r\n\r\nDelaware, as before stated, by her constitution adopted in 1776,\r\nprohibited the further introduction of slaves.\r\n\r\nVirginia did the same thing by her law adopted in 1778.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania, whose legislature had ceased to be under the control of the\r\nQuakers, as they refused to take part in the Revolution, adopted a law in\r\n1780, prohibiting the further introduction of slaves and giving freedom to\r\nall children of slave mothers born after its passage.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts incorporated a declaration in her bill of rights adopted in\r\n1780, that \"all men are born free and equal,\" and under that declaration\r\nit was decided by the Supreme Court of that State in 1783, that slavery\r\nwas prohibited. It cannot be claimed that this declaration was intended\r\nto have that effect, for if such had been the case it would not have been\r\nleft to judicial interpretation to give it, but an express provision\r\nwould have been incorporated on the subject. It was a species of judicial\r\nlegislation which was submitted to because no important interest was at\r\nstake. There were a little over 6,000 slaves in Massachusetts at the\r\ndate of the Revolution, distributed in small numbers among the owners\r\nand employed mostly as household servants. The population was largely\r\nengaged in commerce, fisheries, manufactures, etc., and the character\r\nof the agriculture was not at all adapted to slave labor. Nothing of\r\nconsequence therefore, was to be gained by contesting the validity of the\r\ndecision, and it was the easiest way of getting rid of the matter by quiet\r\nsubmission.\r\n\r\nNew Hampshire adopted a similar clause in her second constitution in 1783,\r\nand under that it was held that freedom was guaranteed to all children\r\nborn after its adoption.\r\n\r\nMaryland adopted in 1783, laws in regard to the introduction of slaves\r\nsimilar to those of Virginia.\r\n\r\nConnecticut and Rhode Island, in 1784, adopted laws on the subject of\r\nslavery similar to those of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these laws and decisions was to put an end to the slave\r\ntrade in all of the states but North and South Carolina and Georgia; to\r\nabolish it in Massachusetts and provide for its gradual extinction in New\r\nHampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Pennsylvania, while it still\r\nremained as before in the other states. It has been alleged, and probably\r\nwas true, that a large number of the slaves in the northern states were\r\ncarried to the South and sold there, to avoid the operation of the\r\nemancipation measures which were initiated. This allegation receives very\r\nstrong confirmation from a comparison of the free colonies' population\r\nat the north at different periods, with the number of slaves known to be\r\nthere at the date of the institution of emancipation measures, when taken\r\nin connection with the increase to that colored population, from freed\r\nslaves and runaways from the South.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the provisions for abolishing slavery in the New England\r\nstates, the merchants and traders of those states resumed the importation\r\nof slaves from Africa to the Carolinas and Georgia immediately after the\r\nclose of the war. North Carolina, however, had denounced the trade as\r\nimpolitic, and imposed a duty on future importations which furnished an\r\nimpediment to it, so far as that state was concerned.\r\n\r\nThe confederation which, during the war, under the pressure of the public\r\ndanger, had answered the purpose, was found to work very badly when\r\npeace ensued and the states were no longer stimulated to comply with\r\nthe requisitions of Congress by immediate necessity. Though the states\r\nwere all vested with full powers to regulate their domestic affairs,\r\nyet there was a large debt contracted in common which it was necessary\r\nto provide for, and as the states were forbidden by the Articles of\r\nConfederation to make treaties, and Congress had no power to impose taxes\r\nor duties on imports or exports, which power rested entirely in the state\r\nlegislatures, there was a very great derangement of the finances, commerce\r\nand business of the country, entailing very ruinous consequences upon\r\nall classes and interests. It became, therefore, necessary to provide a\r\nremedy for existing evils, and a convention of delegates from the states\r\nassembled at Philadelphia in the year 1787, for the purpose of revising\r\nthe Federal system. This convention was assembled in accordance with the\r\nrecommendation of a previous one, that had assembled at Annapolis on the\r\ninvitation of Virginia, but found its powers inadequate.\r\n\r\nThe deliberations of the Philadelphia convention, which were presided over\r\nby General Washington, resulted in the adoption of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, for recommendation to the states for their ratification,\r\nand by the terms of the Constitution, it was provided that it should go\r\ninto effect when ratified by nine states, as to the states ratifying it.\r\n\r\nThere were many difficulties in the way of the formation of the\r\nConstitution by reason of conflicting views and interests, and the\r\ninstrument as framed by the convention was the result of a compromise\r\nof those views and interests. The only questions arising in regard to\r\nslavery was in relation to the basis of representation in Congress and\r\ntaxation, the foreign slave trade and the restoration of fugitive slaves.\r\nThe questions in regard to representation and taxation were settled\r\nby compromise, as was that in regard to the slave trade. Virginia and\r\nMaryland were in favor of an absolute and immediate prohibition of\r\nthe foreign slave trade, while South Carolina and Georgia opposed any\r\ninterference with it. With the two latter states some of the New England\r\ndelegates sided, and after much discussion a compromise was finally\r\neffected, by adopting a provision prohibiting Congress from preventing,\r\nprior to the year 1808, the importation of any persons the states might\r\nthink proper to admit, but giving the power to impose a duty on such\r\npersons in the meantime, not to exceed $10 per head. This compromise was\r\neffected by an arrangement between the delegates of South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia on the one side and the New England delegates on the other, by\r\nwhich it was agreed to insert a provision vesting Congress with the power\r\nto pass navigation laws by a majority vote--which was earnestly desired by\r\nNew England but was opposed by some of the other states--and to adopt the\r\nrestriction prohibiting any interference with the slave trade until the\r\ntime designated.\r\n\r\nFor the provision in regard to the slave trade as adopted, Massachusetts,\r\nNew Hampshire and Connecticut, the only New England States represented,\r\nvoted, while Virginia voted with some of the other states against it\r\nin all its stages--the final vote being, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,\r\nConnecticut, Maryland, North and South Carolina in the affirmative, and\r\nNew Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Virginia in the negative; absent or\r\nnot voting, New York, Rhode Island and Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe clause in regard to the restoration of fugitive slaves was adopted\r\nwithout any objection from any quarter, and it was worded in almost the\r\nidentical language of the provision on the same subject contained in\r\nthe old compact of \"The United Colonies of New England.\" Without the\r\nprovision for the return of slaves escaping into any of the states or the\r\npublic territory, not a solitary Southern State would have accepted the\r\nConstitution, and its necessity, propriety and justice were conceded on\r\nall sides without question. When the Constitution was submitted to the\r\nstates for ratification, it met with a good deal of opposition because\r\nit was thought to impose too great restrictions on the rights of the\r\nstates, but it was finally ratified by the end of July, 1788, by eleven\r\nstates, and steps were taken to organize the government under it, which\r\nwas done in April, 1789, by the meeting of the first Congress under the\r\nConstitution and the inauguration of General Washington as President.\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina did not ratify the Constitution until November, 1789,\r\nnor Rhode Island until May, 1790, and until they did ratify it they\r\nremained as foreign nations to the other states. When the ratification\r\nwas under consideration, there was much discussion as to the construction\r\nof various clauses, and most of the states were induced to give their\r\nassent by the hope of adoption of amendments explaining all ambiguities\r\nand objectionable clauses, and the ratification was accompanied with the\r\nrecommendation of such amendments as were desired.\r\n\r\nIn passing the ordinance ratifying the Constitution, the Virginia\r\nconvention adopted an explanatory preamble, declaring that when the\r\npowers delegated should be abused they would be resumed, and the New\r\nYork convention accompanied the ratification with a declaration of the\r\nright to withdraw it. It is curious in view of subsequent events, that\r\nMassachusetts proposed as an amendment \"That all powers not expressly\r\ndelegated to Congress should be reserved to the states,\" and another \"That\r\nno person be tried for any crime (cases in the military and naval service\r\nexcepted) without previous indictment by a grand jury; and that in civil\r\ncases the right of trial by jury be preserved.\" The first of these was\r\nrecommended by Virginia and South Carolina also, and the last by Virginia,\r\nand both were subsequently adopted as amendments to the Constitution\r\non the recommendation of the first Congress, with only a change of\r\nphraseology not at all effecting their import. Massachusetts has changed\r\nher views since she asserted these doctrines of states' rights and civil\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States left slavery in the states precisely\r\nwhere it was before, the only provision having any reference to it\r\nwhatever being that which fixed the ratio of representation in the House\r\nof Representatives and direct taxation; that in reference to the foreign\r\nslave trade, and that guaranteeing the return of fugitive slaves. Had it\r\nbeen proposed to insert any provision giving Congress any power over the\r\nsubject in the states, it would have been resisted, and the insertion of\r\nsuch provision would have insured the rejection of the Constitution. The\r\ngovernment framed under this Constitution being one of delegated powers\r\nentirely, those powers were necessarily limited to the objects for which\r\nthey were granted, but to prevent all misconception, the 9th and 10th\r\namendments were adopted, the first providing that \"The enumeration in the\r\nConstitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage\r\nothers retained by the people,\" and the other that: \"The powers not\r\ndelegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it\r\nto the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.\"\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt has now been shown how slavery originated in the United States and that\r\nthe Federal Constitution left its regulation in every particular, where\r\nit belonged, that is to the several states where it existed, save only\r\nin regard to the foreign slave trade and the guarantee for the return of\r\nfugitive slaves as mentioned.\r\n\r\nState action had already provided for the removal of slavery from several\r\nof the northern states, and this was followed, later, by a law adopted in\r\nNew York in 1799, providing that all children of slaves born after the\r\n4th of July of that year should be free, males at 28 and females at 25\r\nyears of age, and a law adopted in New Jersey in 1804, providing that all\r\nchildren of slaves born after the 4th of July of that year should be free,\r\nthe males at 25 and the females at 21 years of age. This was the last of\r\nthe acts for the emancipation of slavery where it previously existed and\r\ntherefore, so far as regarded the original thirteen states, slavery was\r\nconfined to Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia, except as to the remnants left in the other states by the acts\r\nfor gradual emancipation, which lingered in some of them for a long time.\r\n\r\nIf African slavery was a crime, who was responsible for it? Did the sole\r\nguilt or the greater part of it rest upon the shoulders of the colonists\r\nwho purchased the slaves already ravished from their homes in the plains\r\nand wilds of Africa, or on the shoulders of the descendants of the\r\noriginal purchasers who found the institution already established as a\r\nsettled policy, or did it rest with those who procured the enslavement of\r\nthese ignorant and degraded barbarians and reaped the enormous profits\r\nresulting from their sale in their persons?\r\n\r\nTreating it as national or individual sin, where does the guilt lie? The\r\nmercantile marines of Great Britain and New England are monuments to the\r\nAfrican slave trade, upon the profits of which they were mainly built up.\r\n\r\nIt has been often said that the assertion contained in the Declaration\r\nof Independence \"That all men are created equal, etc.,\" was entirely\r\ninconsistent with the continuation of slavery in any of the United\r\nStates; and that the states which continued it were guilty of a great\r\ninconsistency. Who had then a right to make this criticism? Was it the\r\nEnglishman, with Lord Mansfield's decision staring him in the face, and\r\nhis boast of liberty under the common law on his tongue, while his heel\r\nwas upon the neck of Ireland, his ships ploughing the main, freighted\r\nwith human merchandise packed to suffocation, and his writs of execution\r\nlevied upon the bodies of human beings to satisfy his demands? Was it the\r\nFrenchman, who, equally guilty in the traffic in human flesh, in the name\r\nof \"Liberty, Equality and Fraternity\" glutted the guillotine with the\r\nblood of his brethren, until he himself was forced to take refuge from\r\nhis own \"Liberty\" under the protection of a despotism that kept watch\r\nupon his very thoughts? Was it the Dutchman, whose ships had carried the\r\ntraffic in slaves to every clime and who landed the first cargo within the\r\nlimits of the United States? Was it the Russian, who had bleeding Poland\r\nunder his feet and caused order to reign in Warsaw, while he peopled\r\nSiberia with every age and sex, and his ears were gladdened by the sound\r\nof the well-plied knout? Was it the Prussian, the Austrian, the Dane, the\r\nSwede, or the Italian? The Portuguese, the Spaniard and the Turk have not\r\ntroubled themselves about the matter.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the assertion of independence was made by the Continental\r\nCongress, by a resolution adopted on the 2d of July, 1776, in the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That these United Colonies are, and, of right, ought to be,\r\nFree and Independent States, that they are absolved from all allegiance to\r\nthe British crown, and that all political connection between them and the\r\nstate of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the authoritative assertion of the independence of the colonies,\r\nand the Declaration of Independence adopted afterwards was merely a\r\nmanifesto put forth to the world to show the reasons which impelled them\r\nto the step and to justify it. The assertion that \"all men are created\r\nequal,\" was no more enacted by that declaration as a settled principle\r\nthan that other which defined George III to be \"a tyrant and unfit to be\r\nthe ruler of a free people.\" The Declaration of Independence contained a\r\nnumber of undoubtedly correct principles and some abstract generalities\r\nuttered under the enthusiasm and excitement of a struggle for the right of\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\nThe portion of it in question was not designed for the wide application\r\nwhich is sought to be made of it, nor is it capable of that application.\r\nThe intention of it was to assert the right of the people, on whose\r\npart the declaration was made, to equality under the law with all other\r\nBritish subjects, and to maintain their right to set up a new government\r\nfor themselves, when the one under which they had been living had been\r\nperverted to their oppression. If it was intended to assert the absolute\r\nequality of all men, it was false in principle and in fact.\r\n\r\nTaken in its literal sense, it might be construed to mean that all men\r\nare created equal in every respect, but does any one believe, or will any\r\none ever believe, that the native Congo, the Hottentot or the Australian\r\nnegro, is the equal, mentally, physically and morally, of the Caucasian?\r\n\r\nWhatever construction the words quoted and those following them may admit\r\nof, let it be borne in mind, that they belong to the argument and not to\r\nthe fact. The separation and independence were asserted by the resolution\r\nadopted on the 2d of July, and not by the declaration adopted on the 4th,\r\nand the latter was no more a part of what was authoritatively established,\r\nthan the _obitur dictum_ of a judge is a part of his decision.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that several of the statesmen of the South and especially of\r\nVirginia, deplored slavery as an evil and expressed the hope that at some\r\nfuture time, in some way that might be desired, the institution might be\r\nabolished in such manner as to secure the welfare of both races, but none\r\nof them could suggest any mode for doing so, and though perfectly sincere,\r\nthey contented themselves with expressing the hope that the way might be\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nSlavery was a fixed fact, fastened upon the colonies by the mother\r\ncountry, and in the South, the slaves bore such a proportion to the white\r\npopulation and the whole business of the country was so identified with\r\ntheir labor, that it was impossible to emancipate them, without entailing\r\non both races evils far greater than those supposed to result from the\r\nexistence of slavery itself. It was a practical question with which the\r\nstatesmen of the country had to deal as practical men, and all they could\r\ndo, was to allow the system to remain, as the best for all parties under\r\nthe circumstances, without reverting to the dangerous experiment of the\r\nideal schemes of a false philanthropy.\r\n\r\nAs to the slave trade, Delaware, Virginia and Maryland had already put\r\nan end to it as soon as they were vested with the power to do so, and\r\nNorth Carolina followed suit very shortly after the adoption of the\r\nConstitution, and the prohibition would probably have been made general,\r\nbut for the combination of the New England states with the two southern\r\nstates that were in favor of having the trade continued.\r\n\r\nIt would not be amiss to notice what was transpiring in England on this\r\nsubject at the time the Federal Constitution was being adopted. Clarkson,\r\nWilberforce and others were agitating the question of the slave trade at\r\nthis time, and the utmost that the younger Pitt, then at the head of the\r\ngovernment, would venture to do, was to procure the passage of an act of\r\nParliament, for the mitigation of the atrocities of the \"Middle Passage\"\r\nby which it was provided that slave ships should not carry beyond a\r\ncertain number of slaves in proportion to the tonnage.\r\n\r\nEven this bill met with strong opposition and among others, from Lord\r\nChancellor Thurlow \"the Ruler of the King's conscience.\" In opposing\r\nthe bill he said: \"It appears that the French have offered premiums to\r\nencourage the African trade, and that they have succeeded. The natural\r\npresumption therefore is, that we ought to do the same.\" He further said:\r\n\"One witness has come to your Lordship's bar with a face of woe, his eyes\r\nfull of tears and his countenance fraught with horror, and said 'My Lords,\r\nI am ruined if you pass this bill! I have risked £30,000 on the trade\r\nof this year! It is all I have been able to gain by my industry, and if\r\nI lose it, I must go to the hospital! I desire of you to think of such\r\nthings, my Lords, in your humane frenzy and to show some humanity to the\r\nwhites as well as the negroes.'\"\r\n\r\nThe bill, however, passed with amendments to grant compensation for\r\nlosses, and this was as far as English statesmanship would venture to go\r\nat that time. Was it to be expected that American statesmen should be\r\nbetter, wiser and more philanthropic than English statesmen?\r\n\r\nShortly after the close of the war, Virginia had ceded to the\r\nConfederation for the common benefit of all the states, the territory\r\nnorthwest of the Ohio river; and Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut\r\nhad ceded their rights. (?) The claim of Connecticut skipped over\r\nPennsylvania and that state made a very good bargain for herself by\r\nsecuring the title to the lands in what has since been known as the\r\n\"Western Reserve,\" though no officer or soldier or, so far as is known,\r\ncitizen of hers, had even been in the northwestern territory.\r\n\r\nVirginia's original charter, the oldest of all covered the country, but\r\nindependent of that, it had been conquered from the Indians and British by\r\nthe forces of Virginia under George Rogers Clarke. It was a magnificent\r\nempire which Virginia thus surrendered for the common good and for the\r\ncause of the Union of the states, and the only compensation she asked was,\r\nthat the land grants pledged her own soldiers should be ratified.\r\n\r\nDuring the sitting of the convention which framed the Constitution, the\r\nCongress, which was in session, adopted the celebrated ordinance of 1787,\r\nfor the government of the territory northwest of the Ohio river, in\r\nwhich ordinance was contained a prohibition of slavery in that territory\r\nforever, and also a provision for the recovery of slaves escaping into the\r\nterritory similar to that incorporated into the Constitution.\r\n\r\nAt the first session of the first Congress, under the new Constitution, an\r\nact was passed for the government of the territory northwest of the Ohio\r\nriver, by which the ordinance of 1787 was recognized and confirmed.\r\n\r\nIn 1787, South Carolina had surrendered her claim to all territory west\r\nof the present limits, and in 1790, North Carolina ceded to the United\r\nStates that part of her territory which subsequently became the state of\r\nTennessee, with a stipulation, \"that no regulation made or to be made by\r\nCongress shall tend to the emancipation of slaves.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1791, Vermont, formed out of part of the territory of New York, with\r\nthe consent of the legislature of that state, was admitted into the Union\r\nas one of the states and came in without slavery, which was forbidden by\r\nher constitution.\r\n\r\nKentucky (formed out of the territory of Virginia, south of the Ohio\r\nriver, with the assent of her legislature) in 1792 was admitted into the\r\nUnion, and came in with slavery as it existed in Virginia and with similar\r\nlaws on the subject.\r\n\r\nIn 1793, Congress passed an act to carry into effect the provision of\r\nthe Constitution for the restitution of fugitive slaves, providing for\r\ntheir delivery to the owners by order of any United States judge, or any\r\nmagistrate of the city, town or county where they might be arrested, on\r\ndue proofs of ownership, etc.\r\n\r\nIn 1796, Tennessee, formed out of the territory which had been ceded by\r\nNorth Carolina, was admitted into the Union, and came in with slavery as\r\nit existed in North Carolina and with similar laws in regard to it.\r\n\r\nIn 1798, Georgia adopted a new Constitution, in which was a clause\r\nforbidding the importation of slaves from \"Africa or any foreign country.\"\r\nIn this same year Congress passed an act for the establishment of the\r\nMississippi territory out of the territory acquired from Great Britain,\r\nwhich constituted that part of British West Florida lying between a line\r\ndrawn due east from the mouth of the Yazoo to the Chattahoochie river\r\nand the 31st degree of latitude. The act provided for the government and\r\norganization of the Mississippi territory in every respect like the North\r\nWestern territory, except that slavery was not to be prohibited, but an\r\namendment was incorporated into the act without opposition, on motion of a\r\nrepresentative from South Carolina, prohibiting the introduction of slaves\r\ninto the territory from without the United States.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the adoption of the Constitution, South Carolina had\r\npassed a law prohibiting the introduction of slaves from foreign countries\r\nfor a limited period, which was continued by renewal from time to time,\r\nand as North Carolina had adopted a permanent law on the subject, the\r\nforeign slave trade was now prohibited in all of the states as well as\r\nin the public territories, but it continued to be carried on by English,\r\nNew England and New York traders within the limits of South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia despite the laws.\r\n\r\nIn 1802, Georgia ceded to the United States all of her territory west of\r\nher present limits, including her claim to the Mississippi territory.\r\nThis cession including in it the Mississippi territory, embraced all of\r\nthe states of Mississippi and Alabama which was north of the 31st degree\r\nof latitude and the compact made with Georgia stipulated that when the\r\npopulation reached the number of 60,000, the ceded territory should be\r\nerected into a state on the conditions contained in the ordinance of 1787,\r\n\"That article only excepted which prohibits slavery.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1803, on the complaint of South Carolina of the importation, in\r\nviolation of her laws, of slaves from Africa, as well as of free persons\r\nfrom the French West Indies, Congress passed an act imposing a fine of\r\n$1,000 on the captain of a vessel for the importation of such persons in\r\nviolation of the laws of a state, with forfeiture of the vessel. Next\r\nyear, however, South Carolina repealed her laws against the African slave\r\ntrade, and it continued to be lawful there until 1808.\r\n\r\nIn the same year Ohio, erected out of part of the northwestern territory,\r\nwas admitted into the Union and came in without slavery.\r\n\r\nIn this year Louisiana, which had been re-ceded to France by Spain, was\r\nceded to the United States by the French government, with a stipulation\r\nin the treaty of cession that the inhabitants should be secure in their\r\nliberty, property and religion and should be admitted, as soon as\r\npossible, according to the principles of the Federal Constitution to the\r\nenjoyment of the rights of citizens of the United States. The territory\r\nthus ceded, embraced as claimed by the United States, all of the territory\r\nwest of the Mississippi and south of the 31st degree of latitude to the\r\nwestern boundary of the old Spanish province of Florida. Slavery existed\r\nin Louisiana at the time of its acquisition, having been established there\r\nby the French government, and there could be no question as to the meaning\r\nof the guarantee to the inhabitants of security in their property, as the\r\nright of property in slaves was universally acknowledged in all of the\r\ncivilized world, and both of the contracting parties recognized it.\r\n\r\nIn 1804, Congress passed an act organizing the ceded province of Louisiana\r\ninto the Territory of Orleans and the District of Louisiana, the former\r\nto embrace all of the territory south of the 33rd degree of latitude; the\r\nlatter to embrace that part north of the same degree. A provision was\r\nembraced in the act that no slaves should be carried into the Territory\r\nof Orleans or the District of Louisiana, except from some part of the\r\nUnited States by citizens removing thither as actual settlers, and this\r\npermission was not to extend to negroes brought into the United States\r\nsince 1798. This was a direct admission of the right of the people to\r\nremove into the territory with all of their property, including slaves,\r\nand the restriction as to negroes brought into the United States since\r\n1798 was in consequence of the fact that, from that time to the passage of\r\nthe act, the introduction of such persons was prohibited by the laws of\r\nall of the States, showing that the right to introduce slaves was regarded\r\nas resulting under the constitution from the rights under the laws of the\r\nseveral States and from no other.\r\n\r\nBy an act passed at the same session, all of the territory ceded by\r\nGeorgia was included in the territory of Mississippi.\r\n\r\nIn 1805, by Act of Congress, the Territory of Orleans was given a similar\r\ngovernment to that of Mississippi, and the District of Louisiana was made\r\na territory of the second class, that is with the power of legislation\r\nvested in the governor and judges of the territory. Settlements had been\r\npreviously made within the limits of the District of Louisiana on the\r\nArkansas River and within the present limits of Missouri, and slavery had\r\nbeen carried there by settlers from the slave States. The act organizing\r\nthe territory of Louisiana provided for continuing in force all of the\r\nexisting laws and regulations until repealed by the legislature, and\r\nthereby gave direct recognition of the system of slavery, as it had not\r\nonly been protected by the law organizing the District of Louisiana, but\r\nexisted by operation of the old French and Spanish laws still in force.\r\n\r\nIn 1807, at the second session of the 9th Congress, on the recommendation\r\nof Mr. Jefferson, then President, an act was passed for the prohibition\r\nof the slave trade from foreign countries to the United States, to take\r\neffect on the 1st day of January, 1808. Up to that time the trade had\r\nbeen continued by English, New England, and New York traders to South\r\nCarolina and Georgia by evading the laws against it, when such were in\r\nforce, but it ceased after the United States law went into effect; many\r\nslaves were introduced into the port of Charleston within the last four\r\nyears prior to the time when the law went into effect, brought in by\r\nEnglish and Northern vessels.\r\n\r\nIn the same year and about the same time that the United States law was\r\npassed, under the brief ministry of Lord Grenville, the Parliament of\r\nGreat Britain passed the act to abolish the trade on the part of British\r\nsubjects, though not without serious opposition. Among the opponents of\r\nthe measure was another Lord Chancellor of England, Lord Eldon, at that\r\ntime for a short period out of the office which he had held for many\r\nyears, and to which he returned in about two months after the passage of\r\nthe bill to continue in it until the year 1827. In opposing the bill, Lord\r\nEldon said: \"I do not believe the measure now proposed would diminish the\r\ntransport of negroes, or that a single individual would be preserved by\r\nit, at the same time, that it would be utterly destructive of the British\r\ninterests involved in that commerce.\" He asked \"was it right because\r\nthere was a change of men and of public measures in consequence, that the\r\ninterests of those who petitioned against the bill should be disregarded\r\nand what was before considered fit matter of enquiry should now be\r\nrejected as immaterial and inapplicable?\"\r\n\r\nIn the argument of Wilberforce and others, in favor of the measure, it\r\nwas shown that there had never been any natural increase of the slaves in\r\nthe British and West India Islands--the excess of deaths over births in\r\nJamaica being as follows:\r\n\r\n  From 1698 to 1730, 3 1/2 per cent.\r\n    \"  1730  \" 1755, 2 1/2  \"    \"\r\n    \"  1755  \" 1769, 1 3/4  \"    \"\r\n    \"  1769  \" 1780,   3/5  \"    \"\r\n    \"  1780  \" 1800,   1/24 \"    \"\r\n\r\nThe supply had therefore been kept up by constant importations to meet\r\nthe growing demands and the advocates of the measure urged the following\r\nreasons for its adoption:\r\n\r\n\"The grand, the decisive advantage which recommends the abolition of\r\nthe slave trade is, that by closing the supply of foreign negroes to\r\nwhich the planters have hitherto been accustomed to trust for all of\r\ntheir undertakings, we will compel them to promote the multiplication\r\nof the slaves on their estates; and it is obvious that this cannot be\r\ndone without improving their physical and moral condition. Thus not only\r\nwill the inhuman traffic itself be prevented in so far at least as the\r\ninhabitants of this country are concerned, but a provision will be made\r\nfor the progressive amelioration of the black population in the West\r\nIndies, and that too on the securest of all foundations, the interests and\r\nselfish desires of the masters in whose hands they are placed.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems from this that \"slave breeding\" was not considered a crime by the\r\nphilanthropists of that day but this discovery was reserved for those of a\r\nlater time.\r\n\r\nSlavery in the United States has now been brought down to the time of the\r\nabolition of the slave trade by both the United States and Great Britain,\r\nand it will be seen that the former government had no jurisdiction over\r\nthe matter in any way, except to give protection to that species of\r\nproperty in the states where it existed, in the same way that it was\r\nbound to protect every other species of property within the scope of its\r\ndelegated powers. Slavery existed in the states prior to the creation\r\nof the government and independent of it, and the states in forming that\r\ngovernment as sovereign states, reserved to themselves the exclusive power\r\nof continuing or discontinuing it at their option. Not only was this so\r\nwith regard to the original states, but by express stipulation with the\r\nstates of North Carolina and Georgia at the time of their cession of\r\nterritory. Congress had bound itself not to interfere with slavery in that\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nKentucky had been formed out of part of Virginia and was admitted into\r\nthe Union upon the same footing as that state, and by the treaty with\r\nFrance upon the acquisition of Louisiana, the faith of the United States\r\nwas pledged to respect and protect the right of property in slaves within\r\nthe limits of the acquired territory in the same way that it was pledged\r\nto respect and protect the right of property in every thing else. This\r\nembraced all of the territory within the limits of the United States\r\nexcept the northwestern territory, and to that the prohibition against\r\nslavery had been extended by the ordinance of 1787, prior to the adoption\r\nof the Federal Constitution. The validity of that ordinance has been\r\ndisputed, and certainly if it had any validity, that was given by the\r\nassent of Virginia from whom the territory was acquired. The act for the\r\norganization of the government of the Northwestern territory recognized\r\nthe validity of the restriction contained in the ordinance, and did not\r\ncreate it.\r\n\r\nThe states which had thought proper to abolish or exclude slavery because\r\nit was not to their interests to have it, had no right to complain of\r\nits existence in other states. If they did not desire to be allied to\r\nstates which tolerated slavery, then they should have refused to ratify\r\nthe Constitution. Having ratified it, the faith of those states became\r\npledged by every consideration that can bind states as communities, or\r\nmen as individuals, to respect the institutions, rights and property of\r\nthe other states and to faithfully abide by all of the compromises and\r\nguaranties of the Constitution. They were bound to respect and abide\r\nby them not only in the capacity of states, but they were bound by the\r\nexercise of their just powers of legislation and restraint, to compel\r\ntheir citizens to respect and abide by them. This obligation extended not\r\nmerely to abstaining from all violent interference and active measures\r\nof wrong, but from all agitation or incitement to others to do wrong, by\r\ndisturbing the peace, property or rights of other states and the citizens\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution did not make the general government censors over the\r\nmorals or domestic institutions of the several states, nor did it make\r\nthe states or the citizens thereof censors of the moral or domestic\r\ninstitutions of each other. It was merely a compact formed between\r\nsovereign states for the common defence and protection of each other in\r\ntheir rights and liberties, as they existed before its formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n=Causes Leading to Secession--Secession of the Cotton States=\r\n\r\n\r\nVery shortly after the organization of the government under the new\r\nConstitution, petitions upon the subject of the slave trade began to be\r\npresented to Congress, mostly from the Quakers of Pennsylvania, that\r\n\"non-resisting\" sect \"conscientiously opposed to all war.\" Some of the\r\npetitions were very inflammatory in their character, and caused much\r\nexcited debate in the early Congresses, and one presented by Warren\r\nMifflin, a Quaker of Delaware, urging the injustice of slavery and the\r\nnecessity for its abolition, was returned to him by order of the House at\r\nthe second session of the second Congress on account of its incendiary and\r\nmischievous character.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1805, the first proposition for the abolition of slavery in\r\nthe District of Columbia was made. It was made by Sloan, a democratic\r\nrepresentative from New Jersey, and was \"that all children born after the\r\nensuing 4th of July should be free at certain ages,\" but it was refused a\r\nreference to a committee and was then rejected by a vote of 77 to 31. It\r\nis a little remarkable in view of subsequent events that 26 of the 31 were\r\nNorthern Democrats, and that only 5 constituting the remainder of the vote\r\nfor the proposition were Northern Federalists.\r\n\r\nAfter the passage of the acts in the United States and Great Britain\r\nabolishing the slave trade, the agitation on the subject of slavery abated\r\nvery considerably for a number of years, only, however, to be revived at a\r\nlater period in a more virulent form.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1812, the state of Louisiana, erected out of the territory\r\nof Orleans, was admitted into the Union as a slave state, and that part\r\nof the territory east of the Pearl river and bordering on the Gulf of\r\nMexico, was added to the territory of Mississippi. The name of Mississippi\r\nwas then given to the territory of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nIn 1816, Indiana was admitted into the Union as a free state, and in 1817,\r\nMississippi was admitted as a slave state, the residue of the territory of\r\nthat name taking the name of Alabama.\r\n\r\nIn 1818, Illinois was admitted as a free state and in 1819, Alabama came\r\nin as a slave state. This increase of the number of slave states did not\r\nincrease the number of slaves, as the slaves introduced into them came\r\nfrom the older slave states. If any slaves were introduced from Africa or\r\nany foreign country, it was by such evasion of the laws as will take place\r\nunder any government, and they were not so introduced to any appreciable\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nIn 1819, towards the close of the 15th Congress, a bill was introduced\r\ninto the House of Representatives to authorize the erection of the state\r\nof Missouri out of part of the territory of that name, and on motion of\r\nTallmadge, of New York, a clause was inserted in the bill prohibiting\r\nthe further introduction of slaves and granting freedom to the afterborn\r\nchildren of those already there, on arriving at the age of twenty-five,\r\nthe proposition being carried by a vote of 87 to 76. This proposed\r\nrestriction caused a very excited debate, in the course of which Cobb, of\r\nGeorgia, said that \"a fire had been kindled which all the water of the\r\nocean could not put out, and which only seas of blood could extinguish;\"\r\nhe did not \"hesitate to declare that if the northern members persisted,\r\nthe Union would be dissolved.\" The bill, however, passed the House with\r\nthe restriction, but in the Senate, the latter was stricken out, the\r\nclause prohibiting the further introduction of slaves by a vote of 24 to\r\n16, and the one freeing the children by a larger vote, there being only 7\r\nvotes for retaining it. The House refused to concur with the Senate and\r\nthe bill was lost.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Missouri bill was introduced, another bill was\r\npresented for establishing Arkansas territory out of that part of the\r\nMissouri territory south of 36° 30´, and a clause was inserted into it\r\ngranting freedom to all afterborn children of slaves, at the age of\r\ntwenty-five, but a clause prohibiting the further introduction of slaves\r\nwas defeated by a vote of 70 to 71 and the clause for freeing the children\r\nof those already in the territory was stricken out. Taylor of New York\r\nthen proposed to add a proviso to the bill that neither slavery nor\r\ninvoluntary servitude should exist in any of the territories of the United\r\nStates north of 36° 30´, but his motion was defeated and the bill for\r\norganizing Arkansas Territory passed both houses without any restriction.\r\n\r\nBefore the meeting of the next Congress, Massachusetts authorized the\r\nformation of the District of Maine into a state and a Constitution was\r\nadopted by the people in that district for that purpose. In the meantime\r\nthere was much agitation in the North upon the subject of excluding\r\nslavery from the territory west of the Mississippi. Upon the meeting\r\nof the 16th Congress, a bill was introduced to authorize the people of\r\nMissouri to frame a State Constitution, but on motion of Taylor, the\r\nauthor of the proposed proviso excluding slavery from the territories\r\nnorth of 36° 30´, a committee was appointed to consider the subject of\r\nprohibiting slavery west of the Mississippi, and the Missouri bill was\r\npostponed to await the action of the committee.\r\n\r\nA bill had been introduced for the admission of Maine--and after the\r\ndefeat of a motion to postpone it until the Missouri bill came up--was\r\npassed. When this bill came up in the Senate, a clause for the admission\r\nof Missouri, was attached to it, after the defeat of a motion to insert\r\nin the latter a proviso for the prohibition of slavery, and Thomas,\r\na senator from Illinois, then proposed an amendment prohibiting the\r\nintroduction of slavery into any of the remaining territory north of 36°\r\n30´, which was adopted by a vote of 34 to 10; the senators from Virginia,\r\nSouth Carolina, Georgia, Indiana, and one senator from North Carolina and\r\nMississippi each voting in the negative. The bill was then passed by a\r\nvote of 24 to 20, all the senators from the slave states and the two from\r\nIllinois voting in the affirmative, and those voting in the negative being\r\nfrom the free states.\r\n\r\nThe House refused to concur in the Senate's amendment, and the Senate\r\nadhered, therefore a committee of conference was appointed. In the\r\nmeantime, the House had been debating the Missouri bill, and pending the\r\nconference it was passed by a vote of 93 to 84 with a clause prohibiting\r\nthe further introduction of slaves. When this bill went to the Senate,\r\nthe prohibition was stricken out and the Thomas proviso attached, and it\r\nwas then passed and returned to the House. The Committee of Conference\r\nat the same time reported recommending that the Senate recede from its\r\namendment to the Maine bill and that the House pass the Missouri bill as\r\namended by the Senate. The House agreed to the amendment to the Missouri\r\nbill, striking out the clause for prohibiting slavery, by a vote of 90\r\nto 87, and to that inserting the Thomas proviso, by a vote of 134 to 42,\r\n35 of the latter being Southern members who objected to the proviso as\r\nunconstitutional, and 5 being Northern men who objected because it did not\r\ngo far enough. The Senate receded from its amendment to the Maine bill and\r\nboth bills were thus passed.\r\n\r\nPresident Monroe signed the Missouri bill after much hesitation, upon\r\nhaving his scruples as to the constitutionality of the proviso removed,\r\nand upon being assured that the restriction as to the territories extended\r\nto them only while in the territorial condition.\r\n\r\nThe bill in relation to Maine admitted that state into the Union at once,\r\nbut that in regard to Missouri was a mere act enabling the people to frame\r\na Constitution, and a joint resolution for the admission of the state\r\nafter the formation of the Constitution was still necessary.\r\n\r\nWhen the Constitution was presented at the next session of Congress, it\r\nwas found to contain a clause requiring the legislature to pass laws to\r\nprevent free persons of color from settling in the state, and as the\r\nadmission of Maine was complete, the Northern members took occasion to\r\nobject to the admission of Missouri because of this clause, though Ohio\r\nand Indiana had passed laws forbidding the settling of free persons of\r\ncolor in those states, and there was an old law of Massachusetts to the\r\nsame effect, still unrepealed. A resolution offered in the House for the\r\nadmission of Missouri, with its Constitution as it stood, was defeated by\r\na vote of 78 to 93, those voting in the negative being Northern members.\r\nAfter much discussion and excitement and the defeat in the House of\r\nan effort to compromise the question, on motion of Mr. Clay, a joint\r\ncommittee was appointed to take the subject into consideration, and this\r\ncommittee reported a joint resolution for the admission of Missouri,\r\nafter the state legislature should have given a solemn pledge, that\r\nthe Constitution should not be construed to authorize any act and that\r\nno act should be passed \"by which any of the citizens of either of the\r\nstates should be excluded from the enjoyment of any of the privileges and\r\nimmunities to which they are entitled under the Constitution of the United\r\nStates.\" The President being authorized to announce by proclamation, the\r\nadoption of the pledge, and Missouri then to become a state in the Union,\r\nthis resolution was adopted, the vote being 86 to 52 in the House, all the\r\nvotes in the negative, excepting four, being given by Northern members and\r\nthe four Southern members not being willing to submit to the concession.\r\nSince the rejection of the proposition for compromise in the House on the\r\nsame basis, news had been received of the final ratification by Spain of\r\nthe treaty for the cession of Florida, and as by that treaty the United\r\nStates relinquished all claim to Texas, thus reducing the whole of the\r\nterritory south of 36° 30´ and west of the Mississippi to the Territory of\r\nArkansas, comprising the present state of Arkansas and the small tract of\r\nIndian country west of it, while there remained an immense domain north\r\nof that parallel, stretching across the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific,\r\na few Northern members were induced to cast their votes for the last\r\nproposition, thus securing its passage.\r\n\r\nThe required pledge was given by the legislature of Missouri, and that\r\nstate was thus admitted into the Union in 1821. For a long time, the\r\narrangement by which the passage of the enabling act for Missouri was\r\nsecured, was called _compromise_, and the line of 36° 30´ was called \"The\r\nMissouri Compromise Line.\" The subject was fully explained by Mr. Clay\r\nin the Senate in 1850, and it will be seen that the arrangement was no\r\ncompromise at all, but was merely one of those legislative expedients\r\noften adopted to secure the passage of a measure. As it passed, the\r\nrestriction was merely a legislative enactment, liable to repeal at any\r\ntime like any other law. But few of the Northern members agreed to the\r\narrangement, and at the very next session of Congress, the great mass of\r\nthem repudiated the idea of its being a compromise by voting against the\r\nadmission of Missouri, upon a mere pretext.\r\n\r\nThe only compromise made at all was that made with the state of Missouri\r\nabout the construction of her Constitution. Nevertheless, the Southern\r\nStates were always to regard this legislative adoption of the line 36° 30´\r\nas a settlement of the question of slavery in the territories, provided it\r\nwas adhered to as such in principle and spirit, but it was not accepted by\r\nthe Northern people in that light and was made by them the ground-work for\r\nnew demands and encroachments.\r\n\r\nThe proposition for the prohibition of slavery in the territories, was\r\nnot one in favor of the freedom of the slaves themselves, as their\r\nintroduction into those territories would not increase the number of\r\nslaves, but would expand them on a wider sphere, thus rendering it easier\r\nto adopt measures for emancipation, at least in some of the states if that\r\nwas desirable, and making the condition of the slaves more comfortable if\r\nemancipation did not take place; while the restriction of the institution\r\nto the states where it existed, would forever close the door on any steps\r\nfor its voluntary abolition and render the condition of the slaves much\r\nless desirable. Diffusion was much the best policy for both masters and\r\nslaves, and the opposition to the introduction of the latter into the\r\nterritories was only a political manoeuvre for the purpose of obtaining\r\na sectional preponderance of power, and in all of the debates, the views\r\nexpressed by the advocates of the restriction tended to the furtherance of\r\nthat object.\r\n\r\nBy the final ratification of the treaty between the United States and\r\nSpain in the year 1821, Florida became a territory of the United States\r\nand a territorial government was soon formed therefor.\r\n\r\nAfter the admission of Missouri into the Union, there was a subsidence in\r\nthe agitation upon the subject of slavery for a number of years, though\r\nevery now and then a petition from some Quaker meeting was received and\r\nquietly disposed of.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1834, the British parliament passed an act for the abolition\r\nof slavery in the British West Indies, her colonies in those islands\r\nbeing all of the slave colonies left to Great Britain. These colonies\r\nhad dwindled into insignificance and formed but a very inconsiderable\r\npart of her gigantic colonial system. Canada, Australia, New Zealand\r\nand her possessions in the East Indies furnished an ample field for\r\nBritish settlement and colonial trade, which dwarfed into very diminutive\r\nproportions the British interests in the West Indies. Great Britain could\r\ntherefore afford to be philanthropic and at the cost of £20,000,000 (about\r\n$96,000,000) she gave liberty to a very few more than 600,000 slaves,\r\nwho were placed in a condition of apprenticeship for several years to\r\nenable the planters to accommodate themselves to the new order of things\r\nby degrees. She had abandoned the slave trade after, by the loss of the\r\nAmerican colonies, she had ceased to have a large interest in the subject\r\nof slavery, and this grant of £20,000,000 for the freedom of all of the\r\nnegro slaves left in her dominions, was the final atonement she made for\r\nthe millions she had consigned to slavery, and the millions who had been\r\ncast overboard, to meet a watery grave, on their route to slavery.\r\n\r\nTo make her own gracious act more conspicuous, she turned propagandist\r\nand commenced denouncing the system of slavery which she had been so\r\ninstrumental in fixing upon the world, as un-Christian, inhuman and\r\nbarbarous. Having, as she considered, cast the beam out of her own eye,\r\nshe could see more distinctly the mote in that of others, but she made\r\nno restitution of the hundreds of millions she derived from the profits\r\nof the inhuman traffic as she now styled it, and which had assisted in\r\nbuilding up her marine, manufactures and commerce. Having thus washed\r\nher hands of the sin, as she imagined, she became most intolerant in\r\nher opinions and denunciations of those upon whom she had entailed the\r\ninstitution of slavery by her avarice and power, furnishing another\r\nexample of those,\r\n\r\n    \"Who compound for sins they're inclined to,\r\n     By damning those they have no mind to.\"\r\n\r\nEmissaries soon came out from Great Britain to the United States and began\r\nthe agitation of the abolition of slavery there. The preponderance of\r\nwomen in the New England States caused them to be selected as proselytes\r\nfor the new crusade. There was also a class of men in that section,\r\noffshoots of the old persecuting theocracy who furnished recruits to the\r\nagitators. There were doubtless many who really believed slavery to be a\r\ngreat sin and wrong, who joined in the crusade from conscientious motives.\r\nKnaves there were in plentiful supply, gowned and ungowned, who were ready\r\nfor anything which would tend to their personal advancement in position or\r\ntheir pecuniary profit. Out of these materials abolition societies were\r\nformed and petitions began to pour into Congress for the abolition of\r\nslavery in the District of Columbia and other places within the Federal\r\njurisdiction, while the mails were filled with incendiary publications\r\ncalculated to stir up insurrections. John Quincy Adams, who had held\r\npolitical office from his earliest manhood, until he became President,\r\nobtained a return to political life by his election to the lower House of\r\nCongress. Shortly after his return there, in presenting one of the chronic\r\npetitions of the Quakers for the abolition of slavery in the District of\r\nColumbia, he had taken occasion to notify the House and the country that\r\nhe had no sympathy with the views of the politicians, yet he joined the\r\nnew agitators.\r\n\r\nThis new agitation in Congress began about 1834-5 and was continued with\r\ngreat violence for several years, a petition being presented by Mr.\r\nAdams, during the time, for the dissolution of the Union. After much\r\nexasperation of feeling growing out of the presentation of the petitions\r\nin both Houses of Congress and the circulation of incendiary publications,\r\nsome respite from the excitement in Congress was obtained by the adoption\r\nof a rule in the lower House for laying petitions on the table on their\r\npresentation, without debate, and by the conservative action of the\r\nSenate. The agitation, however was continued at the North and began\r\nto have an important influence upon the canvass for the presidential\r\nelections. The law for the recovery of fugitive slaves, always inefficient\r\nbecause of the refusal or failure of the states' officers to enforce it,\r\nhad now become a dead letter by the resistance to its execution by mobs\r\nand the still more mischievous action of several of the legislatures of\r\nthe free states. The circulation of incendiary publications through the\r\nmails had been forbidden by Congress, but the Northern press was prolific\r\nin the production of gross libels upon the character of the people of the\r\nSouthern states and misrepresentations of the institution of slavery as it\r\nexisted there; even the Constitution of the United States was denounced by\r\nthe new lights as \"a league with hell and a covenant with death.\"\r\n\r\nArkansas had been admitted as a slave state in the year 1836 and Michigan\r\nas a free state in 1837; and in 1845 Florida was admitted as a slave\r\nstate, the same act providing for the admission of Iowa, which was a free\r\nstate, but did not come in until 1846.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of December, the independent Republic of Texas was admitted\r\ninto the Union as a state, and came in with slavery already established\r\nthere. This admission, or annexation as it was called, of Texas, resulted\r\nin the war with Mexico and the establishment, at the close of the war\r\nin 1848, of the Rio Grande as the southern boundary of Texas and the\r\nacquisition of the provinces or territories of New Mexico and upper\r\nCalifornia as United States territory.\r\n\r\nThe admission of Texas gave a new impulse to the antislavery agitation,\r\nand the acquisition, by the war, of the new territory brought it again\r\nprominently before Congress. Even before the close of the war with\r\nMexico, the old proposition for the exclusion of slavery from the public\r\nterritories was revived, with a view to its application to any territory\r\nthat might be acquired as a result of the war, and it was then designated\r\nas the \"Wilmot Proviso\" from the name of the member re-introducing it. On\r\nall propositions to establish governments of the newly acquired territory,\r\nafter the close of the war, the \"Wilmot Proviso\" was pressed with great\r\nvehemence by Northern politicians, and was strenuously resisted by those\r\nof the South.\r\n\r\nThe most extreme of the Southern politicians were willing to extend the\r\nso-called Missouri Compromise line of 36° 30´ to the Pacific ocean,\r\nand regard it as a final settlement of the question, but the Northern\r\nadvocates of the proviso would listen to no terms for an adjustment, and\r\nthus again repudiated the principle and spirit of the settlement made by\r\nthe Missouri bill. Southern statesmen, while willing to accept the line of\r\n36° 30´ for the sake of peace, did not claim the right to foster slavery\r\neven upon the territory south of that line, by the action of Congress,\r\nbut they claimed that the question should be left where the Constitution\r\nof the United States left it, that is, that the people settling in the\r\nterritories should be allowed freedom to adopt their own institutions when\r\nthey came to form state governments, and that Congress in the meantime\r\nshould adopt no measures to forestall their action. They urged that\r\nthe territory was acquired by the common blood and treasure, and that\r\nCongress, therefore, in its action, should not give preference to one\r\nsection over another and thus virtually exclude the people of the South\r\nfrom the newly acquired domain. This was a reasonable and just view of\r\nthe subject, and did not look to the increase of the number of slaves,\r\nbut merely to their expansion over a wider area, and the older states\r\nfrom the rapidly increasing slave population. Nor was the proposition to\r\nexclude slavery ever in the interest of freedom, for it sought merely to\r\nconfine slavery to the country where it already existed, and thus surround\r\nthe slave states with a cordon of free states, so as to increase year\r\nby year, the difficulties of prospective emancipation, and render any\r\nbut a subversion of the institution by violence an impossibility. It was\r\nas injurious to the slaves themselves as to the white population of the\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nHad the would-be philanthropists been governed by an enlightened regard\r\nfor the welfare or freedom of the slaves, they would not have objected to\r\ntheir introduction, either into the territory north of 36° 30´ or that\r\nacquired from Mexico, for with the greater eagerness existing at the North\r\nfor emigration, as well as that from foreign countries and the want of\r\nadaptation of the soil and climate of the greater part of the territory,\r\nold and new, to the staples in the production of which slave labor could\r\nbe profitably employed, it was certain that much the larger population\r\nsettling in that territory would be from the free states and foreign\r\ncountries, and it was equally certain that, when the people came to form\r\nnew states, slavery would be prohibited and freedom given to the slaves\r\nwithin the limits of most, if not all of those states.\r\n\r\nBut fanaticism of no kind, whether political or religious, listens to\r\nreason, and among the pseudo-philanthropists there was much of the leaven\r\nof that old spirit, which had prompted the hanging, burning and scourging\r\nof \"heretics and witches.\"\r\n\r\nThere were many politicians by trade, whose aspirations had been\r\nunsuccessful and who cared nothing for the negro or the cause of freedom,\r\nbut who fell in with the \"free-soil\" movement, as it was called with the\r\nselfish hope of building up a great sectional party under the auspices of\r\nwhich they could obtain and retain that power which they had failed to\r\nacquire otherwise. A very large mass of men rarely think for themselves\r\nand among this class the leaders of the \"free-soil\" operated extensively\r\nby impassioned appeals to their prejudices and passions, inducing them\r\nto believe that their vital interests required that slavery should be\r\nexcluded by law from the territories. One of the shrewdest and most\r\nfar-seeing of the \"free-soil\" leaders boldly declared that there was a\r\n\"higher law\" than the Constitution and that there was \"an _impassable_\r\nconflict between slavery and freedom.\"\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that there were extreme men at the South on the other\r\nside, but they were made so mostly by the hostile attitude assumed by\r\ntheir opponents.\r\n\r\nThe result of the agitation was that for some time no government could\r\nbe formed for any part of the new territory. The exasperation of feeling\r\nbetween the two sections of the Union, and the danger to that Union\r\nitself, became so great that in 1850 the more moderate of the leading\r\nstatesmen of the country, with Clay and Webster at their head, devoted\r\nthemselves to the adjustment of the threatening questions and their\r\nefforts resulted in the adoption of certain measures commonly called\r\nthe \"Compromise Measures of 1850.\" These measures consisted of a bill\r\nfor the admission of California into the Union, under a constitution\r\nexcluding slavery, which had been irregularly adopted a bill to establish\r\na territorial government for Utah and a bill to establish the northern\r\nand western boundaries of Texas with her assent, and to establish\r\na territorial government for New Mexico, it being provided in the\r\nterritorial bills that states created out of the two territories organized\r\nwhen the population should be sufficient, should be admitted into the\r\nUnion with or without slavery, as the people themselves might decide.\r\n\r\nAlong with these bills another was passed for enforcing the provision of\r\nthe Constitution in regard to the return of fugitive slaves, as the former\r\none could not be executed because most of the free states had prohibited\r\ntheir officers from acting under it. These measures as a whole were not\r\nacceptable to the extreme men of either section, but the more moderate\r\nportion of the two leading political parties hoped that they would put\r\nan end to the agitation and restore peace and concord to the country.\r\nSuch appeared to be their first effect, and both of the great political\r\nparties, into which the country had been divided, without reference\r\nto sections for many years--Democrat and Whig--in their platforms of\r\nprinciples adopted in the canvass for President in 1852, gave their\r\nadhesion to the \"Compromise Measures of 1850\" as a final settlement of the\r\nquestions embraced by them.\r\n\r\nIn 1848, a portion of the \"free-soilers\" had run Martin Van Buren, a\r\nformer President and a defeated candidate for the Democratic nomination,\r\nas their candidate for the Presidency, but the party did not have\r\ncohesiveness enough to give him its whole vote, and in 1852 the\r\n\"free-soil\" party had no candidate, the members of it voting with the\r\nparties to which they had previously been attached according to their\r\npredilections, though there was still much muttering by the leaders.\r\n\r\nThe abolition party proper, however, had a candidate for form's sake.\r\n\r\nIn 1848, Wisconsin had been added to the Union as a free state, and there\r\nwere now in the Union sixteen free states and fifteen slave states, giving\r\nto the free states the preponderance in the Senate, as they had long had\r\nin the lower House. Neither Utah nor New Mexico was fitted at all for\r\nslave labor, and there was no territory out of which it was likely that\r\nanother slave state could be formed, except by the sub-division of Texas,\r\nwhile there was a prospect for the formation of several more free states,\r\nat no distant day, out of the territory west of the Mississippi and north\r\nof 36° 30´ and on the Pacific coast, the territories of Minnesota and\r\nOregon having already been organized.\r\n\r\nBy what was called the Compromise of 1850, the South had gained nothing\r\nwhatever, except the abstract principle inserted in the Utah and New\r\nMexico bills, of non-interference by Congress with the question of\r\nslavery and the submission of the decision of the question to the people\r\nof the territories when they came to frame their state governments,\r\nwhile the North had gained the rich and growing state of California. The\r\nbill for the restoration of fugitive slaves was in accordance with an\r\nexpress stipulation in the Constitution, without which it would never\r\nhave been adopted. Yet the execution of this law was resisted from the\r\nvery beginning and very soon most of the free states passed laws, called\r\n\"personal liberty bills\" which virtually nullified the act of Congress.\r\nSeveral collisions ensued between the United States officers in their\r\nefforts to execute the law and mobs in the free states who resisted its\r\nexecution, and even members on the floor of Congress denounced the law\r\nand counselled resistance to it. This served to prevent that harmonious\r\nfeeling which had been expected from the adoption of the measures of\r\nadjustment, and the new fugitive slave act became soon a dead letter\r\nfrom the danger, difficulty and expense attending its execution. Not\r\nonly was the guaranty contained in the Constitution, and the act of\r\nCongress to enforce it, thus rendered nugatory, but for many years slaves\r\nhad been enticed by agents from the North to make their escape and aid\r\nhad been furnished them while doing so, under a system which obtained\r\nthe designation of \"The underground railroad.\" This was not confined\r\nto citizens merely but was participated in by state officers who were\r\nsworn to support the Constitution of the United States, and instead of\r\ncompelling their citizens and officers to comply with the Constitution and\r\nlaw, many of the free states passed laws to make it a felony for the owner\r\nto arrest his slave or for any one to assist him.\r\n\r\nAt the session of Congress for 1853-54 in the introduction of a bill\r\nfor the establishment of governments for the territories of Kansas and\r\nNebraska, both north of 36° 30´, a proposition was made by Mr. Douglas,\r\na senator from Illinois, to incorporate a provision in regard to slavery\r\nsimilar to that contained in the Utah and New Mexico bills. When the\r\nmeasure was offered by a Northern man, it was supported by nearly all\r\nof the Southern representatives as correct in principle, though it met\r\nwith the opposition of a few Southern representatives and statesmen,\r\nwho deprecated it as tending to arouse again the excitement which had\r\npartially subsided.\r\n\r\nThe question was not one of any great practical importance, as the climate\r\nand soil of Kansas and Nebraska furnished a more formidable barrier to\r\nthe introduction of slaves than any legal enactment. The proposition to\r\nrepeal the enactment as to the line of 36° 30´ violated no compromise, as\r\nhas been shown, and it violated no right of any of the Northern states or\r\npeople, but merely asserted a principle deducible from the Constitution\r\nand right in itself; though in this case it was an abstract one.\r\n\r\nThe measure was passed with the assistance of some of the Northern\r\nDemocrats, and it had the effect so much dreaded by the conservative\r\nmen who opposed it, of reviving with new intensity the fires of the\r\nformer agitation and of giving new life to the languishing free-soil\r\nor Republican party. Though they had never acceded to or complied with\r\nthe compromise in regard to Missouri or that of 1850, or even those of\r\nthe Constitution itself, the leaders of the free-soil party raised a\r\ntremendous clamor about the violation of plighted faith, and soon the\r\nagitation spread over the whole North with ten fold force.\r\n\r\nThe Puritan ministers of New England, successors of the Cotton-Mathers\r\nof religious persecution and witches-killing notoriety, abandoned the\r\ngospel of peace for dissertations upon the merits of Sharp's rifles, and\r\nunder their auspices a considerable number of armed emigrants were sent\r\nto Kansas. In consequence of this movement some hot heads from the South\r\nimprudently went to Kansas for the purpose of disputing the settlement\r\nof that territory with the emissaries of the New England parsons. The\r\nresult was that a very disorderly condition of things ensued in the new\r\nterritories, as is always the case where reason gives way to passion.\r\nMany wrongs and acts of violence were committed on both sides and there\r\nwas a tremendous howl about \"bleeding Kansas\" by the Northern parsons and\r\nagitators, but not one slave was carried into Kansas and no one thought of\r\ncarrying any there.\r\n\r\nThe result of the agitation consequent on the theoretic extension of\r\nslavery to Kansas and Nebraska, and of the troubles in Kansas, was the\r\nappearance of John C. Fremont as the Republican free-soil candidate for\r\nthe presidency in 1856. He was beaten, but his vote showed the existence\r\nof a formidable sectional party, in all of the free states, based on a\r\nsolitary idea. The strength of this party was still further increased\r\nby an attempt to secure the admission of Kansas into the Union, under a\r\nConstitution liberating slavery and adopted by a convention held during\r\nthe prevalence of the bitter feud there, but the most important result of\r\nthe Kansas troubles was the development of the character of John Brown, a\r\nbold, desperate and fanatical Northern man, who made his appearance on the\r\nscene of action, and participated largely in the outrages committed by the\r\nfree-soilers and abolitionists.\r\n\r\nWhat gave the crowning stroke to the already over-heated animosity\r\nbetween the two sections, was the appearance of John Brown on a new\r\ntheatre of action. The political parsons and the agitators of the North\r\ndid not confine themselves to the denunciation of the Southern people\r\nand of slavery, but they lavished their anathemas upon the Constitution\r\nwhich tolerated slavery and the Union which gave it, as they alleged,\r\nprotection. Nor were the denunciations confined to Northern pulpits and\r\nabolition or free-soil papers, but were heard in the Senate Chamber and\r\non the floor of the House of Representatives, and were accompanied with\r\nthe most atrocious libels on the Southern people, in which they were\r\nrepresented as barbarians who delighted in inflicting upon their slaves\r\nthe most revolting cruelties, and who engaged in the most debasing\r\nimmoralities. Encouraged by these open denunciations of the Constitution\r\nand the Union, and stimulated by the picture of Southern wrongs and\r\ncruelty to the slaves, which were constantly placed before his eyes, John\r\nBrown gave way to the wild conceptions of a fanatical mind and undertook\r\nto subvert the government of the United States and to redress the wrongs\r\nof the slaves by deluging the Southern states in blood.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1858, he held a secret meeting or convention of reckless\r\nfanatics like himself at Chatham, in Canada West, and devised a scheme\r\nfor a provisional government of the United States, of which he was to be\r\nthe head, with a cabinet appointed by himself, and he concocted a plan\r\nfor putting his government in operation by raising a rebellion among the\r\nslaves and freeing them. All of these proceedings were kept from the\r\npublic until the month of October, 1859, when John Brown, with a band of\r\nfollowers, made his appearance suddenly at Harper's Ferry, within the\r\nlimits of Virginia, surprised and captured the United States arsenal at\r\nthat place, which was without a guard; killed several citizens; captured\r\nand imprisoned others, and committed a number of depredations and\r\nrobberies in the neighborhood. His pretended provisional government was\r\nproclaimed and the object of the movement declared, but failing to receive\r\nsome expected re-inforcements, and not meeting with co-operation on the\r\npart of the slaves for whom he brought a supply of arms and expected to\r\nget others from the arsenal, he and his band of desperadoes were soon\r\nsurrounded and the greater part captured or killed. John Brown himself was\r\nmade a prisoner in a wounded condition and he and several of his followers\r\nwere tried under the laws of Virginia, convicted and executed for treason\r\nand murder.\r\n\r\nHis plan of operations contemplated a servile insurrection in all of the\r\nSouthern states with all of the horrors of blood and rapine, and his\r\nacts amounted to treason, not only against the state of Virginia, but\r\nagainst the United States; yet there was reason to suspect that some of\r\nthe leaders of the Republican or free-soil party, were cognizant of his\r\ndesigns if they did not secretly favor them. Certain it is that very\r\ngreat sympathy was openly expressed for him by many individuals and by\r\npublic meetings at the North, and that the legislature of Massachusetts,\r\nby an almost unanimous vote, adjourned over so as not to be in session on\r\nthe day of his execution, avowedly as a mark of respect for him, and of\r\ncondemnation at his execution.\r\n\r\nWhen this desperate undertaking of John Brown to deluge the South with\r\nfire and sword, and the marked sympathy for him expressed at the North,\r\nwere added to the failure of the Northern states to comply with their\r\nplighted faith in regard to the restoration of fugitive slaves--to their\r\ninterference with the institutions of those states, the persistent libels\r\nupon the Southern people, the encouragement given to the slaves to revolt\r\nby incendiary publications, the attitude of hostility assumed by a great\r\nnumber of the Northern representatives to the South on every occasion in\r\nwhich anything had been proposed or done in regard to slavery, and to the\r\nrapid growth of the party now coming into the ascendency on the ground of\r\nenmity to the South and her institutions--it may be well conceived that a\r\nprofound sensation was created in the latter section.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina then proposed some agreement between the Southern states,\r\nfor the purpose of withdrawing from a compact, the obligations of which\r\nhad been so disregarded, but Virginia discouraged this proposition, as she\r\nwas exceedingly loth to take any step looking to the severance of a Union\r\nwhich she had done so much to establish, and for which she had made so\r\nmany sacrifices.\r\n\r\nBy the commencement of the canvass for the Presidency in 1860, the\r\nDemocratic party had become divided on the question of the construction\r\nof the slavery clause in the Kansas-Nebraska bill: that is whether the\r\npower to exclude or adopt slavery could be exercised by the people of\r\nthe territories while in the territorial condition. Mr. Douglas and the\r\ngreater portion of the Northern Democrats contended for the former view,\r\nwhile nearly all of the Southern Democrats advocated the latter. It was\r\ncontended by the Southern Democrats with great force and justice that if\r\nCongress did not have the power to exclude slavery, the legislatures of\r\nthe territories, which derived their powers from the acts organizing the\r\nterritories could not have that power. This view was conclusive, for the\r\nterritorial legislatures, being now temporary bodies deriving their sole\r\npowers from the acts of Congress, could not exercise greater powers than\r\nthe body which created them, while the people, when they came to form\r\nconstitutions, under that clause of the Constitution of the United States\r\nproviding for the admission of new states on the same footing with the\r\nold, were necessarily vested with that sovereign power over this subject\r\nand all others which belonged to the original states.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Democrats contended for what was called \"Squatter\r\nSovereignty,\" that is, that this sovereign power of legislation vested\r\nin the settlers of the territories from the beginning, and to propitiate\r\nthe free-soil sentiment, many of them contended that the clause in the\r\nKansas-Nebraska bill secured the territories to the north and free-soil\r\nmore effectually than could be done by Congressional legislation, as\r\nsettlers from the North could more readily take possession of the\r\nterritories and exclude slavery from them, than settlers from the\r\nSouth could introduce slavery there, while in Congress the Southern\r\nRepresentatives especially in the Senate where the sections were more\r\nnearly equal, could, with the aid of a few Northern men, prevent any\r\ninterference with slavery. This view of the subject made the doctrine of\r\nsquatter sovereignty even more offensive than what was called the Wilmot\r\nproviso, and Southern men contended that it was a trap to entrap them.\r\n\r\nIt was in fact not a question of construction of the clause in the\r\nKansas-Nebraska bill but of the Constitution itself. If Congress had no\r\npower to legislate on the subject, then it could delegate none, and if\r\nthere was such a thing as \"squatter sovereignty\" it extended to all other\r\nsubjects as well as to slavery, and the settlers in the territories\r\nmight set up for themselves without any authority from Congress, which\r\nwould involve some very extraordinary consequences, including that even\r\nof disposing of the public lands. The squatter sovereignty view of the\r\nquestion was one not to be tolerated; and it applied to the Utah and New\r\nMexico bills as well as to that in regard to Kansas and Nebraska.\r\n\r\nThe great mass of Southern Whigs agreed with the Southern Democrats in\r\ntheir way of interpreting the principle, but they did not regard the\r\nquestion as one of sufficient practical importance to make a fight over,\r\nand old party divisions and feuds prevented a coalescence of all of the\r\nSouthern men.\r\n\r\nThough considered by many an abstract question, as it certainly was so far\r\nas it applied to Kansas and Nebraska, it seemed to divide the Democratic\r\nparty into two wings, a Northern and a Southern one, with some adherents\r\nto either wing from the opposite section. This division resulted in the\r\nnomination of two sets of candidates by the Democratic party--Douglas of\r\nIllinois and Johnson of Georgia by the Northern wing, and Breckenridge of\r\nKentucky and Lane of Oregon by the Southern wing. The Republican free-soil\r\nor abolition party nominated Lincoln of Illinois and Hamlin of Maine,\r\nwhile the Southern Whigs and a remnant of Northern Whigs, who had not\r\nfused with the free-soilers and abolitionists, nominated Bell of Tennessee\r\nand Everett of Massachusetts. The advocates of this latter ticket proposed\r\nto sink every other issue and stand for \"The Union, the Constitution, and\r\nthe enforcement of the Laws.\"\r\n\r\nAt the election in 1860, Lincoln and Hamlin received the majority of the\r\npopular vote in nearly all of the Northern states and by that vote alone\r\nsecured a majority of the votes of the electoral colleges, but they lacked\r\nvery nearly 1,000,000 votes of receiving a majority of the combined\r\npopular vote of the United States. In this election the Southern people\r\nwere unanimous in their opposition to Lincoln and Hamlin though divided as\r\nto the other candidates, the few thousands of votes given on the border\r\nfor the Republican ticket, being given by Northern men who had emigrated\r\nacross the line, and amounting to a very inconsiderable fraction.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time in the history of the Government that a mere\r\nsectional candidate had been elected and this was done upon sectional\r\nissues alone. This result presented an alarming state of things and\r\ndeveloped the fact that under a Republican form of Federal Government,\r\nwith suffrage nearly universal, it was perfectly practicable for a\r\nminority to get possession of the government on sectional issues and\r\nperhaps control it permanently. There had been, before, presidents elected\r\nby a minority popular vote, but this was on National issues and the\r\nsupport of the successful candidate was confined to no particular section.\r\nOf the thirteen presidents elected, seven had been elected from Southern\r\nstates, and all of them received majorities of the popular vote except Mr.\r\nPolk of Tennessee, and his principal opponent was Mr. Clay of Kentucky, a\r\nSouthern man.\r\n\r\nSix had been selected from Northern states, and but one of them, Harrison\r\nof Ohio, but a native of Virginia, received a majority of the popular\r\nvotes.\r\n\r\nOf the Southern presidents, Washington's electoral vote was unanimous.\r\nJefferson received twenty Northern electoral votes at his first election,\r\nand all but nine of them at his second. Madison received a majority of\r\nNorthern electoral votes at his first election and forty of them at his\r\nsecond. Monroe received a very large majority of Northern electoral votes\r\nat his first election and all but one at his last, that being the only\r\nvote cast against him. Jackson received 73 Northern and Northwestern\r\nelectoral votes out of 147 cast, at his first election and a very large\r\nmajority at his second election. Polk received 103 of the same vote to 58\r\ncast for Mr. Clay and Taylor received a large majority of the same vote.\r\n\r\nOf the Northern presidents, John Adams received 12 electoral votes from\r\nthe South. John Quincy Adams received six electoral votes from the slave\r\nstates and was elected by the House of Representatives, receiving the\r\nvotes of several slave states. Van Buren received 61 out of 126 votes cast\r\nby the slave states, 28 of the rest being cast for Harrison. Harrison\r\nreceived a large majority of Southern electoral votes, as did Pierce and\r\nBuchanan and in every election the majority of Northern electoral votes\r\nhad been cast for the successful candidates, except at Jefferson's first\r\nelection, Madison's second, Jackson's first and Buchanan's election and in\r\nthis the majority of that vote had been cast for Fremont, the sectional\r\nRepublican candidate. Two vice-presidents, Tyler from Virginia and\r\nFillmore of New York, had succeeded to the presidency by the deaths of the\r\nincumbents and both of them had received majorities of the popular vote as\r\nwell as of the Northern electoral vote.\r\n\r\nLincoln's election therefore was the first instance of the election of a\r\nmere sectional president. It was very evident that if the party electing\r\nhim continued in possession of the government for any length of time,\r\nthere would inevitably follow a subversion of the rights of the states\r\nand a consolidation of all power in the Federal government under the\r\ncontrol of a sectional majority, not a majority of the whole. This form of\r\nconsolidation promised to be infinitely worse than an entire obliteration\r\nof all state lines and a concentration of power in the hands of the entire\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances attending the election of Lincoln, those of the\r\nSouthern states which are usually designated the \"Cotton States\" deemed\r\nthat their own safety required their withdrawal from the Union, and they\r\nconsequently withdrew. The legislature of South Carolina was in session\r\nfor the purpose of appointing electors for president, and when the\r\nresult was ascertained, a convention for that state was called, which\r\nadopted an ordinance of secession on the 20th of December, 1860. Georgia,\r\nFlorida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana soon followed the example of\r\nSouth Carolina, and a Congress of the seceding states met at Montgomery,\r\nAlabama, early in February, 1861, and organized a provisional government\r\nunder the style of the \"Confederate States of America,\" of which the\r\nHonorable Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi, was appointed President, and\r\nthe Honorable A. H. Stephens, of Georgia, Vice-President.\r\n\r\nTexas had previously adopted an ordinance of secession which went into\r\neffect when it was certified by the popular vote and that state soon\r\nafterwards became also one of the Confederate States.\r\n\r\nA permanent constitution was adopted for the Confederate States to go\r\ninto effect on the 22d of February, 1862, modelled after that of the\r\nUnited States, but containing some changes in the details and the powers\r\ndelegated, with more ample recognition of states rights and a prohibition\r\nof the introduction of slaves from any other than the slave-holding states\r\nand territories of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe secession of these states had been without violence, except to\r\ntake possession of some forts and arsenals of the United States within\r\nthe limits of the seceding states, which had been accomplished without\r\nbloodshed. Commissioners were appointed to the United States government,\r\nto effect a peaceful settlement of all questions between the two\r\ngovernments in regard to the public debt, territory, etc.\r\n\r\nThis change in the relations of the seceding states to the United\r\nStates resulted in no change whatever in the domestic affairs of those\r\nstates, but they continued to be regulated as before under the laws and\r\nconstitutions of the several states.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n=Action of the Border Slave States--Convention of Virginia=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Border Slave States,\" as they were called, including North Carolina,\r\nTennessee and Arkansas, which immediately joined the \"Cotton States\" on\r\nthe south, though equally appreciating the outrages upon their rights and\r\nthe dangers to be apprehended in the future, were not at first disposed\r\nto secede, as they had cherished such an habitual attachment to the Union\r\nthat they were exceedingly loth to give it up, being governed by that\r\nsentiment described in the Declaration of Independence in the assertion\r\n\"that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than\r\nto right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.\"\r\n\r\nThe majority of the people of those states were actuated by hope that the\r\nparty which was about to obtain possession of the government would not\r\nlong hold together, and they trusted that the sober second thought of the\r\npeople of the North would keep the dominant party within bounds until it\r\ncould be ejected from power, and that in the meantime guaranties might be\r\nobtained for the rights of the states, so as to bring the government back\r\nto a conformity with its original designs, and effect a restoration of the\r\nUnion. This was especially the case with the State of Virginia, which had\r\nmade so many sacrifices to establish and perpetuate the Union, which in\r\ngreat part had been the work of her own hands. The legislature of Virginia\r\nwas in session when the secession of the \"Cotton States\" began, and the\r\ncrisis was of such a threatening nature that an act was passed, providing\r\nfor the assemblage of a convention, vested with the sovereign power of\r\nthe state, but directing at the same time, that a vote should be taken\r\nupon the question of any ordinance of secession which might be adopted,\r\nand that it should be submitted to the popular vote for ratification\r\nbefore it should be effectual. The legislature also by resolution, invited\r\na convention of commissioners from all of the non-seceding states, North\r\nand South, to assemble at Washington for the purpose of consulting upon\r\nand devising some plan for adjusting the pending difficulties with a view\r\nto a restoration of the Union. This latter convention assembled and was\r\nknown as the \"Peace Convention.\"\r\n\r\nThe election for members of the Virginia convention took place on the\r\nfirst Monday in February, 1861, and a large majority of the delegates\r\nelected were opposed to secession. The convention assembled at the Capitol\r\nin Richmond, on the 13th of February, and a decided union man, Mr. John\r\nJanney, of Loudoun, was chosen President. A deliberative body containing\r\nmore general talent and worth had rarely, if ever, assembled in the state,\r\nand all of the members seemed to be impressed with the momentous character\r\nof the crisis. This convention contained one distinguished gentleman who\r\nhad been President of the United States, another who had been governor of\r\nthe state, a number who had filled seats in the Federal Congress, two who\r\nhad been heads of departments in the Cabinet at Washington, besides many\r\nothers among the most talented and distinguished statesmen and lawyers of\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\nThere was a variety of sentiment among the Union members as to the terms\r\nupon which it would be safe for the state to remain in the Union, but a\r\nvery large majority were earnestly in favor of some adjustment in the\r\nway of amendments to the Constitution of the United States, by which the\r\nseceded states could be induced to return, while the members favoring\r\nimmediate secession constituted a very small minority. A committee was at\r\nonce appointed, which after considerable deliberation reported a plan of\r\nadjustment for submission to the other states through Congress, after its\r\nadoption by the convention. In the meantime the Peace Convention which\r\nassembled at Washington, had adopted a proposition for adjustment which\r\nmet with no favor at the hands of the Republican members of Congress, and\r\nwas not entirely satisfactory to a majority of the Virginia Convention.\r\nPropositions of compromise in Congress had also failed.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia Convention engaged earnestly in the discussion of the\r\nreport of its committee and counter propositions, and continued it until\r\nthe month of April, having in the meantime voted down, by a very large\r\nmajority, a direct proposition for secession.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to describe the intense anxiety felt by most of the\r\nmembers of the convention to preserve the peace of the country and effect\r\nan amicable settlement of the troubles. Lincoln had been inaugurated\r\npresident on the 4th of March, and had delivered an inaugural address that\r\nwas enigmatical in its terms. During the whole of the discussion which was\r\nprogressing in the Virginia convention, the members engaged in the effort\r\nto preserve peace and restore the Union, received no offer whatever of\r\nco-operation from the occupant of the White House, and no direct answer\r\never reached them as coming from him to persons who approached him on the\r\nquestions engrossing all hearts and minds in the state.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of April, the convention had become very anxious in\r\nregard to the uncertain condition of things, and appointed a committee of\r\nthree of its members, of great ability and experience to wait upon Mr.\r\nLincoln and ascertain from him, in a respectful manner, what course he\r\nproposed to take in regard to the seceded states. This committee reached\r\nWashington a little before the attack on Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor,\r\nand had an interview with Mr. Lincoln, receiving very little encouragement\r\nfrom him. While the committee was awaiting a formal answer, which was\r\npromised, the news of the commencement of the bombardment of Fort Sumter\r\nwas received, and the reply from Mr. Lincoln appeared in extra issues from\r\nthe press without having been communicated to the committee.\r\n\r\nThis reply was enigmatical in its terms like the inaugural, but was rather\r\nstronger on the question of coercion. The committee at once returned and\r\nreported to the convention the result of its mission, and Fort Sumter\r\nhaving fallen, a proclamation from Lincoln soon followed, on the 15th of\r\nApril, calling on the states, Virginia included, for 75,000 troops \"to\r\nrepossess the forts, places and property which have been seized from the\r\nUnion.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking that this meant war on the seceded states, and\r\nthe Virginia convention went into secret session, when an ordinance\r\nof secession was introduced by Mr. Ballard Preston, Chairman of the\r\nCommittee, which had waited on Lincoln, and up to that time an opponent of\r\nsecession. After a very earnest discussion, that ordinance was adopted on\r\nthe 17th day of April.\r\n\r\nA number of members of the convention, including myself, who afterwards\r\nfully sustained the action of the state, voted against the passage of\r\nthis ordinance with the hope, even in that stage of the controversy, that\r\nthe people of the North would not respond to the call of Lincoln for\r\ntroops, and that a disruption of the Union and the horrors of war might\r\nstill be avoided. The scenes which occurred during the discussion which\r\nensued after the convention went into secret session, were characterized\r\nby a solemnity rarely witnessed in a deliberative body and several\r\nmembers while speaking were unable to restrain their tears. As for\r\nmyself, it was exceedingly difficult to surrender the attachment of a\r\nlifetime to that Union which had been cemented by the blood of so many\r\npatriots, and which I had been accustomed to look upon (in the language\r\nof Washington) as the palladium of the political safety and prosperity\r\nof the country, and therefore I had hoped even against hope, but I soon\r\nbecame convinced fully that the action of the convention was right, and\r\nthat it could have pursued no other course, consistently with the honor\r\nand dignity of Virginia, and in this opinion I have remained firmly fixed,\r\nnotwithstanding the result of the war which ensued.\r\n\r\nAfter the passage of the ordinance of secession, provision was made for\r\nsubmitting it to the popular vote for ratification, at the elections to\r\nbe held on the fourth Thursday in May. In the meantime steps were taken\r\nfor placing the state in a condition of defence, and an ordinance was\r\npassed directing the governor to call into service of the state as many\r\nvolunteers as might be necessary to defend it against invasion. Colonel\r\nRobert E. Lee, a native and citizen of Virginia, who had resigned his\r\ncommission in the United States Army on hearing the action of his state,\r\nwas appointed by the governor, with the consent of the convention,\r\ncommander-in-chief of all of the forces of the state with the rank of\r\nMajor General.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime an arrangement was made with the Confederate Government\r\nfor assistance in defending the state, in the event of an attempt by the\r\ngovernment at Washington to march troops into or through it with a view to\r\nan invasion of any of the seceded states, and the Confederate Government\r\nwas invited to remove to the City of Richmond.\r\n\r\nThe convention remained in session until the first day of May, when it\r\nadjourned over to the second week in June to await the result of the\r\npopular vote on the ordinance of secession. The ratification was given by\r\nan overwhelming majority of the popular vote, and upon the re-assembling\r\nof the convention the ordinance was duly signed by the greater part of\r\nthe members. I had voted for the ratification at the polls and now put my\r\nsignature to the ordinance.\r\n\r\nVirginia now had fully and completely dissolved her connection with\r\nthe United States, and resumed the powers she had delegated when she\r\nratified the Constitution. To this step she had been impelled against her\r\nprevious inclinations, by the course of the government at Washington,\r\nto avoid being dragged into an unholy war against the Cotton States,\r\nand to maintain the cherished principles for which she had fought, and\r\nwhich she had uniformly asserted since the adoption of the United States\r\nConstitution. When the act of secession was complete, she adopted the\r\nConstitution of the Confederate States, both provisional and permanent,\r\nand was fully admitted into the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina, Tennessee and Arkansas likewise withdrew from the\r\nUnion and became members of the Confederacy for the same reasons which\r\ninfluenced Virginia. Missouri subsequently passed an ordinance of\r\nsecession and joined the Confederacy, but that state was soon overrun\r\nby United States troops, and the regular government was subverted and\r\nanother substituted in its place by the force of Federal bayonets.\r\nKentucky undertook to occupy a neutral position until the greater part\r\nof that state was in the power of the Federal troops, when an irregular\r\ngovernment was formed which passed an ordinance of secession and joined\r\nthe Confederacy. The situation of Maryland was such that she was soon\r\noverrun by troops and prevented any legislative expression of opinion, the\r\nmembers of her legislature being seized and imprisoned. Little Delaware\r\nwas so situated that its voice was never heard at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n=The Right to Withdraw=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe causes which led to the secession of the Southern States have never\r\nbeen given, and when they are compared with those which led to the\r\nAmerican Revolution as given by the First Continental Congress, the latter\r\nsink into comparative insignificance. A large portion of the wrongs\r\ncomplained of in the Declaration of Independence were acts committed after\r\nthe commencement of the collisions between the British troops and the\r\nColonists, and if these were compared with those committed by the Federal\r\ntroops in the beginning of the war, in Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri, to\r\nsay nothing of the long list of outrages perpetrated during its progress,\r\nthe indictment against King George contained in the eloquent language of\r\nthe Declaration of Independence, would be a very tame affair in comparison\r\nwith that which could be preferred against the Government at Washington.\r\n\r\nThe third article of the Confederation had specified the object for which\r\nit had been formed, and that it was \"A firm league of friendship\" for\r\nthe common defence, the security of the liberties and the mutual and\r\ngeneral welfare, and that the states bound themselves to assist each\r\nother against all force offered to or attacks made upon them or any of\r\nthem \"on account of religion, sovereignty, trade or any other pretense\r\nwhatever.\" The preamble to the Constitution recites that it was made \"to\r\nform a more perfect union.\" More perfect how? To the subversion of the\r\nliberties and sovereignty of the states? Had the conduct of the Northern\r\nStates been that of the members of \"a firm league and friendship?\" And\r\nwhen they had so flagrantly violated and neglected the plain stipulations\r\nof the Constitution, did not the Southern States have the same right to\r\nwithdraw from the connection with them, that the colonies had to withdraw\r\nfrom the connection with Great Britain, because the government which had\r\nbeen instituted for \"the common defence and general welfare\" had become\r\n\"destructive of those ends?\"\r\n\r\nWho was to judge of whether there was a necessity for severing the\r\nconnection, the oppressor or the oppressed? If the former, then the\r\ndecision would have been against the colonies. If colonies, the mere\r\noffshoots from the mother country, could undertake to judge the\r\nsufficiency of the grievances and the mode and measure of redress, could\r\nnot sovereign states which had framed the government of which they\r\ncomplained, do the same thing? In seceding from the Union, the Cotton\r\nStates had acted as states, and not as factious individuals resisting\r\nthe laws or authority of the government. The right of no one had been\r\nviolated, and it was not proposed to violate the rights of any individuals\r\nor states, but merely to dissolve a compact, the terms of which had been\r\nviolated. To undertake to coerce those states by military force was\r\nsubversive of the whole spirit and purpose of the Constitution, and made\r\nthe government the master, instead of the agent, of the powers which had\r\ncreated it. This doctrine of coercion had never been asserted by any\r\nrespectable statesman since the foundation of the government, and was at\r\nwar with all of its principles and aims. When therefore the other states\r\nwere called upon to engage in this war of coercion against the Cotton\r\nStates, it was not only their right but their duty to resist. By the very\r\nterms of the Constitution, it was made the duty of the Federal Government\r\nto protect the states against invasion. Did that government have the right\r\nto invade the state it was bound to protect? It was not authorized even\r\nto protect the states against domestic violence except upon invitation\r\nof the legislature or of the executive, when the legislature was not in\r\nsession. Was it authorized to create that domestic violence? The power\r\nof coercion involved the anomalous consequence of reducing the states to\r\nconquered provinces when exercised, and this involved the self-destruction\r\nof the government itself.\r\n\r\nIn regard to this question of the right of the states to withdraw, and\r\nthe power of coercion, it is not inappropriate to call attention to the\r\nfollowing views expressed by Mr. Horace Greeley, one of the ablest writers\r\nand firmest supporters of the Republican or abolition party. In an article\r\npublished in the _New York Tribune_ a few days after the election of\r\nLincoln in 1860, and reproduced in his work styled \"The American Conflict\"\r\nhe says:\r\n\r\n\"That was a base and hypocritic row that was once raised at Southern\r\ndictation about the ears of John Quincy Adams, because he presented a\r\npetition for the dissolution of the Union. The petitioner had a right to\r\nmake the request; it was the member's duty to present it. And now if the\r\nCotton States consider the value of the Union debatable, we maintain their\r\nperfect right to discuss it. Nay! we hold, with Mr. Jefferson, to the\r\ninalienable right of communities to alter or abolish forms of government\r\nthat have become injurious or oppressive, and if the Cotton States shall\r\ndecide that they can do better out of the Union than in it, we insist upon\r\nletting them go in peace. The right to secede may be a revolutionary one\r\nbut it exists nevertheless, and we do not see how one party can have a\r\nright to do what another party has a right to prevent. We must ever resist\r\nthe asserted right of any state to coercion in the Union, and nullify and\r\ndefy the laws thereof; to withdraw from the Union is quite another matter.\r\nAnd whenever a considerable section of our Union shall deliberately\r\nresolve to go out, we shall resist all coercive measures to keep it in.\r\nWe hope never to live in a republic whereof one section is pinned to\r\nanother by bayonets.\r\n\r\n\"But while we uphold the practical liberty, if not the abstract right of\r\nsecession, we must insist that the step be taken, if ever it shall be,\r\nwith the deliberation and gravity becoming so momentous an issue.\r\n\r\n\"Let ample time be given for reflection, let the subject be fully\r\ncanvassed before the people, and let a popular vote be taken in every case\r\nbefore secession is decreed. Let the people be told just why they are\r\nasked to break up the Confederation; let them reflect, deliberate, then\r\nvote; and let the act of secession be the echo of an unmistakable popular\r\nfiat. A judgment thus rendered, a demand for separation so backed, would\r\neither be acquiesced in without effusion of blood, or those who rushed\r\nupon carnage to defy or defeat it, would place themselves clearly in the\r\nwrong.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to conceive language more forcible for defining the\r\nright of the states to withdraw and the wrong and criminality of the\r\nattempt to coerce them when they had exercised that right, than this of\r\nMr. Greeley's. It derives additional force as coming from him, when it\r\nis recollected that he had ever been inimical to the institutions of the\r\nSouth, and it announced principles which had been previously asserted\r\nin all questions of the Union, and underlay the whole superstructure of\r\na government which itself was founded on the right of revolution. It is\r\ndifficult to realize the fact that the man who uttered language like\r\nthat quoted, subsequently became one of the most strenuous advocates of\r\nthe war of coercion, which was waged on the Southern states. Mr. Greeley\r\ncannot avoid the effect of his statement of the principles asserted in\r\nhis article, by contending that the act of separation was not \"the echo\r\nof an unmistakeable popular fiat,\" and that the Southern people were\r\nprecipitated into secession without due deliberation.\r\n\r\nWhen the right to discuss, deliberate and decide, exists, those possessing\r\nit, must necessarily be the sole judges of how it is to be exercised.\r\nThe Southern states did deliberate and did decide that they could no\r\nlonger remain in the Union with safety, and therefore they determined to\r\nwithdraw from it. If the Southern people had been hurried into secession\r\nby their leaders, they are the parties to complain and to hold the guilty\r\nones responsible. They have not done so, and what right had Mr. Greeley\r\nand his party to become their champions against their wishes? He and his\r\nparty are estopped from denying that the Southern people, did with almost\r\nentire unanimity, adopt secession and willingly gave their support to the\r\ncause of separation; for since their country was overrun by a superior\r\nmilitary force, their state governments overthrown; military despotisms\r\nestablished over them; and in the effort to reconstruct the Union, the\r\ngreat mass of the people disfranchised, and the right of suffrage given\r\nto the freed slaves, because it was alleged that the Southern people were\r\nstill rebellious, and so wedded to the idea of secession, notwithstanding\r\nthe bitter experience of the war, that they could not be trusted with the\r\nright to vote and hold office. All of this was done with Mr. Greeley's\r\nfull knowledge and sanction.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown how long, how earnestly, and how anxiously the question\r\nwas discussed in Virginia, and that secession was resorted to by that\r\nstate only when a war of coercion had been proclaimed, and she had been\r\nrequired to furnish troops to carry it on. The state of Virginia believed,\r\nwith Mr. Greeley, that it would be a grievous wrong to \"rush upon carnage\r\nto defy and defeat\" the right of the Cotton States to withdraw from the\r\nUnion; and she determined to do what he had declared his purpose of doing:\r\nthat is \"resist all coercive measures.\" The ordinance of secession\r\nwas submitted to the popular vote at an election held more than one\r\nmonth after its adoption by the convention, and it was ratified by an\r\noverwhelming majority, thus showing beyond dispute that it was \"the echo\r\nof an unmistakable popular fiat.\" Did not \"those who rushed upon carnage\r\nto defy and defeat\" \"a judgment thus rendered, a separation so backed,\"\r\n\"place themselves clearly in the wrong?\"\r\n\r\nYet Virginia was the first of the seceding states invaded by the Federal\r\narmy; her towns and plains were devastated by a long and cruel war; her\r\npeople plundered, imprisoned and murdered; her territory severed, and a\r\nnew state erected within her limits, in violation of the Constitution\r\nof the United States. Subsequently a military despotism was thrust upon\r\nthem, and the freed slaves were vested with the right of suffrage and the\r\ncapacity to hold office, while such wide measures of disfranchisement were\r\nadopted that enough men competent to fill the petty offices of state,\r\neven with those whose fears and cupidity led them to apostatize and the\r\ninflux of adventurers could not be found in all the limits of that old\r\ncommonwealth which has been designated \"the mother of states and of\r\nstatesmen.\"\r\n\r\nIn the case of Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri, the people were overrun by\r\nFederal troops owing to the peculiar nature of their situation, and they\r\nwere deprived of the opportunity of freely discussing and deliberating\r\nupon the questions involved, though the legislature of Missouri did pass\r\nan ordinance of secession. Did not those people, under such circumstances,\r\nhave the right individually to resist so flagrant an outrage upon their\r\nrights and liberties? They were not only deprived of the liberty of\r\npeaceably assembling to discuss their grievances, but it was sought to\r\ndeprive them of the right \"to keep and bear arms,\" as expressly guaranteed\r\nby the second amendment to the Constitution, in order that they might\r\nhave the means always of defending their liberties and rights, and the\r\nonly resource they had was to unite as individuals in the defence of the\r\ncommon cause, and of their own violated homes and liberties.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the Confederate states began the war by firing upon\r\nFort Sumter. If those states had the right to withdraw from the Union and\r\nthe United States had no right to resist or coerce them then the attempt\r\nto maintain a garrisoned fort in one of the most important harbors of the\r\nConfederacy, was an act of war. This had, nevertheless, been patiently\r\nborne with, for nearly three months after the secession of South Carolina,\r\nin whose principal harbor the Fort was situated, and it was only when\r\nthe Government of the United States had given notice of its intention\r\nto supply Fort Sumter \"peaceably, if possible, otherwise by force,\"\r\nand the vessels for that purpose had appeared off the harbor, that the\r\nattack began. The commissioners sent to Washington to effect a peaceable\r\nsettlement of all questions had then been denied an audience, and informed\r\nthat the authorities at Washington would hold no intercourse with them.\r\n\r\nThe war was thus inevitable, and the Federal authorities were quietly\r\npreparing for it, in order to entrap the border states. The threat to\r\nsupply Fort Sumter indicated a purpose of war; was then the Confederate\r\nGovernment to wait until the measures of the Government at Washington\r\nhad been so completely taken that the former would find itself helpless\r\nin the hands of its enemy? The port of Charleston was necessary to it\r\nas an inlet for obtaining supplies and arms for its defence, was it\r\nthen to allow the port, which could block the entrance to that harbor,\r\nto be placed in a condition to render the blockade complete, the harbor\r\nworthless and Charleston untenable?\r\n\r\nThere can be no question of the right of the Confederate Government to\r\nforce a surrender of the fort, which had been refused, and that it was\r\nfully warranted in pursuing the course it did. I must confess that, at\r\nthe time, I deeply deplored and condemned the attack on Fort Sumter, on\r\nthe score of policy, because I regarded the threat of the Washington\r\nGovernment as designed to provoke a commencement of the conflict by the\r\nfiring of the first shot, and not intended really to be carried into\r\neffect. It is now manifest that war had already been resolved upon, and\r\nthe firing of the first gun on Fort Sumter was not its commencement. The\r\nwar was begun by the attempt to hold the forts in the Confederate harbors.\r\n\r\nIt has been alleged that the Southern States had previously controlled\r\nthe policy of the government, and that they seceded because they had now\r\nlost that power. There had never been a president elected from any of\r\nthe Cotton States, which established the Confederate Government except\r\nfrom Louisiana, of which state General Taylor was a nominal resident, but\r\nreally a native of Virginia, and an officer in the army, and he lived\r\nbut a little over a year after his inauguration. These Cotton States had\r\nfurnished comparatively few cabinet ministers, and they had in the main\r\nbeen opposed to the policy pursued by the government in regard to the\r\nmost important branches of legislation, such as internal improvements,\r\nthe public lands, tariff, etc. Their leading interest, the culture of\r\ncotton, had received no fostering care whatever from the government, and\r\nSouth Carolina had been complaining for more than thirty years that her\r\ninterest had been sacrificed to Northern cupidity by high tariff and at\r\none time she had taken steps to nullify the laws on that subject. In no\r\nsense could the state which initiated secession, be said to be actuated by\r\ndisappointment at the loss of Federal power.\r\n\r\nIt is true that they had lost the power to protect themselves in the\r\nUnion, as the Constitution had been so flagrantly violated and were now\r\nthreatened with submission--and for this they seceded.\r\n\r\nThe state of Virginia had given four of the Southern presidents to the\r\nUnion, and Tennessee the other two. Washington had been the unanimous\r\nchoice of all of the states; Jefferson, Madison and Munroe had been\r\nnational men in their policy and had received the support of a large\r\nmajority of the Northern vote; Munroe being accepted without opposition\r\nat his last election and receiving all of the votes, North and South, but\r\none northern electoral vote. Munroe was the last Virginian elected or\r\nnominated as President. It is true Tyler had succeeded to the office by\r\nthe death of Harrison, but he had not received the vote of Virginia even\r\nas vice-president.\r\n\r\nVirginia had voted against Clay, Harrison, Taylor and Scott, all natives\r\nof the state, when they were candidates for the presidency, and she had\r\ncast her vote three times against Mr. Clay, and in the cases of Harrison,\r\nTaylor and Scott, her vote had been cast for Northern men against them.\r\nAll of the presidents she had given had been re-elected, because there was\r\nnothing sectional or local in their policy, while no Northern president\r\nhad been re-elected, though three out of the six had been candidates\r\nagain. In the election of 1860, the state of Virginia cast its vote for\r\nBell and Everett, by a plurality vote over Breckenridge and Lane, and\r\nDouglas and Johnson, showing that in this election she was not liable to\r\nthe charge of sectionalism, even if that charge could be brought against\r\nthe supporters of Breckenridge and Lane, which is by no means admitted.\r\nNo interest of Virginia had at any time been fostered by the action of\r\nthe government, in any stage of its history, and the government had not\r\neven taken steps to obtain from foreign countries a diminution of the\r\nenormous duties placed on her leading staple, tobacco, but her statesmen,\r\nwhen in office, had pursued a policy looking to the general welfare and\r\nprosperity. If she had furnished many statesmen to the common councils,\r\nit was because of the general confidence in their patriotism, and freedom\r\nfrom all selfish ambition and narrow-minded notions of policy.\r\n\r\nHer history from the beginning of the controversy with Great Britain had\r\nbeen one of sacrifices for the benefit of all of the states. She had\r\npromptly sent troops to Massachusetts on the commencement of the war of\r\nthe Revolution in that state, all of its battlefields were red with the\r\nblood of her sons; and that war had been terminated on her own soil. With\r\na territory larger than that of all of the other states at the conclusion\r\nof peace, she had surrendered an empire beyond the Ohio river, for the\r\nsake of Union and for the common benefit; and subsequently, she had\r\nconsented to the erection of the state of Kentucky within her remaining\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nAs the acknowledgement of the independence of the states had left her, she\r\nwould have been amply able to take care of herself, and erect a powerful\r\ngovernment of her own, yet she had contracted her power and narrowed her\r\nlimits for what she considered the common good.[A]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote A: Note--The following extract is from the \"History of\r\n  the American Civil War\" by Professor Draper, a Northern Union man,\r\n  which shows the nature of Virginia's sacrifices: \"At the time of the\r\n  Declaration of Independence, Virginia was the most powerful of the\r\n  colonies; she occupied a central position and had in Norfolk one of\r\n  the best harbors on the Atlantic. She had a vast western territory,\r\n  an imposing commerce, and in the production and export of tobacco\r\n  not only a source of wealth, but from the mercantile connections\r\n  it gave her in Europe, a means of refinement. It was through this\r\n  circumstance that so many of her young men were educated abroad. When\r\n  the epoch of separation from the mother country had come, and the\r\n  question of Confederation arose, she might have asserted her colonial\r\n  supremacy; she might have been the central power. Many of her ablest\r\n  men subsequently thought that in her voluntary equalization with the\r\n  feeblest colonies, the spontaneous surrender of her vast domain, the\r\n  self-abnegation with which she sacrificed all her privileges on the\r\n  altar of the Union, she had made a fatal mistake. In her action there\r\n  was something very noble.\"]\r\n\r\nThe Union had not advanced her pecuniary or material interests, yet, in\r\nall of its trials, she had been its firmest supporter and her blood had\r\nbeen freely shed in all of its wars and upon all of its battlefields. It\r\nwas only where that Union was to be perverted from its original designs\r\nand made the means of humiliating and degrading the Southern states,\r\nherself included, that Virginia resolved upon severing the connection.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, New England had made no sacrifices for the Union, and\r\nhad received only benefits from it. To that section the Union had been a\r\n\"paying operation\" in every way: its fisheries, commerce and factories\r\nhad been fostered and protected by high bounties and duties until its\r\ncomparatively sterile soil bloomed as a garden, while its surplus\r\npopulation found homes in the fertile region surrendered by Virginia.\r\nDescendants of the Puritans did not undertake to become \"philanthropists\"\r\nuntil the slave trade with the South ceased to be profitable.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the benefits received by the New England states from the\r\nUnion, the first proposition for its dissolution came from those states\r\nwhen the country was engaged in a foreign war--the war of 1812 with Great\r\nBritain--because that war was caused by a temporary suspension of their\r\ncommerce. Most of these states refused to permit their militia to be\r\nmarched beyond their limits for the common defence and the question of a\r\nseparate peace with the public enemy was mooted, notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat the war had been undertaken in defence of commercial rights in which\r\nNew England was principally interested. Such was the spirit manifested in\r\nthat section that the British government in declaring a blockade for the\r\ncoast of the United States, for some time exempted the New England coast\r\nfrom that blockade and did not invade those states.\r\n\r\nUpon the passage of an act for a general embargo in 1814, so as to put\r\na stop to the contraband trade from New England, the Massachusetts\r\nlegislature was flooded with petitions for redress and protection against\r\nthe act of the Federal government in enforcing the embargo, and a\r\ncommittee to which the petitions were referred, made a report in which the\r\nfollowing views, among others, were expressed:\r\n\r\n\"The sovereignty reserved to the states, was reserved to protect the\r\ncitizens from acts of violence by the United States, as well as for\r\nthe purposes of domestic regulation. We spurn the idea that the free,\r\nsovereign and independent State of Massachusetts is reduced to a mere\r\nmunicipal corporation, without the power to protect its people or to\r\ndefend them from oppression from whatever quarter it comes. Whenever the\r\nnational compact is violated and the citizens of this state are oppressed\r\nby cruel and unauthorized enactments, this legislature is bound to\r\ninterpose its power and to wrest from the oppressor its victim.\"\r\n\r\nTo show the spirit animating the people of Massachusetts in the assertion\r\nof these doctrines--however true they might be in principle--when the news\r\nwas received of the abdication of Buonaparte and the restoration of the\r\nBourbons in 1814--thus leaving the British government at liberty to employ\r\nall of its forces against the United States, the people of Massachusetts\r\nas well as of all New England hailed the news with joy and exultation,\r\n\"as the harbinger of peace and the renewal of commerce;\" and the event\r\nwas celebrated at Boston by a religious ceremony and a sermon from the\r\ncelebrated Dr. Channing.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1814, the legislature of Massachusetts invited a convention\r\nof the New England states, which assembled in Hartford in December of\r\nthat year and adopted a series of resolutions in which it was declared,\r\namong other things, that, \"In cases of deliberate, dangerous and palpable\r\nviolations of the Constitution, affecting the sovereignty of a state and\r\nthe liberties of a people, it was not only the right but the duty also\r\nof that state, to interpose its authority for their protection, when\r\nemergencies occur, either beyond the reach of the judicial tribunal or too\r\npressing to admit of delay incident to their forms; states which have no\r\ncommon umpire must be their own judges and execute their own decisions.\"\r\nThe danger to the Union from these steps on the part of Massachusetts and\r\nthe other New England states, in a time of public war, was put to an end\r\nby the unexpected arrival of the news of a treaty of peace; this perhaps\r\nprevented the former state from proceeding to assert her sovereignty and\r\nmaking a separate peace with Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIn fact in 1809, during the existence of the troubles growing out of\r\nthe embargo passed before the close of Mr. Jefferson's administration,\r\nJohn Quincy Adams had communicated to the government at Washington that\r\nthe object of the dominant party in Massachusetts was, and had been for\r\nseveral years, the establishment of a separate confederacy, as he knew\r\nfrom unequivocal evidence; and that in case of a civil war, the aid of\r\nGreat Britain to affect that purpose would be assuredly resorted to, as it\r\nwould be indispensably necessary to the design.\r\n\r\nThere was strong reason to suspect that during the war some secret\r\narrangement existed with the enemy, by which New England withheld from\r\nthe country the support of her troops and her soil was kept free from\r\ninvasion. In all the measures then resorted to in order to embarrass the\r\ngovernment, Massachusetts took the lead, yet when a war of invasion and\r\nsubjugation against the Southern states was waged, Massachusetts found no\r\nconstitutional difficulties, had no scruples about sending her troops into\r\nthe South.\r\n\r\nThe idea that any of the Southern states resorted to secession because of\r\nthe loss of the power and patronage of the government is not founded on\r\nfact, as neither had ever been used for their special benefit even when\r\nin the hands of Southern men, but it was the Northern states whose trade\r\nand factories had grown up under the fostering care of the government\r\nthroughout its whole history, while the schools of the Northwest had been\r\nrichly endowed from the public lands and the gigantic system of railroads\r\nin the same quarter had been built up mainly from grants of this common\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nIt has been further alleged that it was the slave power which attempted to\r\nbreak up the government, because of its defeat, and that that power had\r\nhitherto controlled the government in its interest. In the first place, it\r\nis as well to state that as far as the executive branch of the government\r\nwas concerned, there had been nothing of which to complain on the part of\r\nthe Southern people. The great difficulty had been with the legislative\r\ndepartment, which always manifested a disposition, more or less, to be\r\naggressive on the subject of slavery, and the Southern people looked to\r\nthe executive to interpose its conservative influence. The preponderance\r\nof Northern men in Congress, already increased by the admission of Oregon\r\nand Minnesota, and soon further to be increased by the admission of\r\nKansas, had become so great, that the only hope of the South was in the\r\nexecutive, and when that branch of the government was also sectionalized,\r\nthere was no safety for the weaker section. The people of the South had\r\nnever asked the government to protect slavery; they had merely asked that\r\nit should be let alone, and left where the Constitution left it.\r\n\r\nIn entering the Union, they had stipulated for a government for certain\r\ngeneral purposes, and not one to regulate their domestic affairs; and they\r\nclaimed that the government should be confined to the purposes for which\r\nit was instituted. That government had in no way acted so as to strengthen\r\nslavery, and it had not been able to comply with the express stipulation\r\nfor the return of fugitive slaves. Slavery had been excluded from an\r\nimmense territory by the action of the government, but it had not been\r\ncarried to one foot of territory by that action. All of the new states\r\neast of the Mississippi, except Florida, had been formed out of territory\r\noriginally belonging to the slave states, and they had been admitted into\r\nthe Union under that provision of the Constitution which declared that\r\nsuch states should be admitted upon the same footing in every respect with\r\nthe original states and to add to this obligation not to interfere with\r\ntheir domestic institutions, the states ceding the territory had expressly\r\nstipulated that there should be no interference with slavery.\r\n\r\nLouisiana came in by treaty as slave territory, and with a stipulation for\r\nthe protection of the people in their property. Out of that territory,\r\nthree slave states had been formed, and they were the last there was any\r\nprospect of forming; while the free states of Iowa, Oregon and Minnesota\r\nhad already been admitted from the same territory with the prospect of the\r\nspeedy admission of Kansas and Nebraska and the not remote prospect of\r\nan indefinite number of other free states from the same territory. Texas\r\nhad come in as a state from the condition of an independent republic and\r\nthe measures leading to her admission had resulted in the acquisition\r\nand admission of California as a free state with a prospect of more\r\nfree states from the territory acquired. So that in every case of the\r\nintroduction of new slave territory into the Union, there had been largely\r\nmore than equivalent in territory for the formation of free states except\r\nin the case of the slave territory of Florida; and when that was acquired\r\nthe vastly larger and more important slave territory of Texas had been\r\nsurrendered. It is not a fact, then, in any sense of the term, that the\r\ngovernment had been used for the protection and growth of the slave power.\r\nThat power, if it might be called such, was relatively stronger the day\r\nthe Constitution was formed than it was ever afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n=Injurious Effect of Misinformation=\r\n\r\n\r\nIn connection with this claim of the slave power were the most shocking\r\nmisrepresentations of the condition of the slaves themselves and of the\r\nsocial relations of the Southern people, in order to array the prejudices\r\nof the world against their cause. This course of misrepresentation had\r\nlong been pursued before the war, and was not confined to American\r\nwriters, but many works appeared from the British press containing libels\r\nupon the society of the Southern states and false views of slavery as\r\nestablished there. Such works in both countries were evidently written by\r\npersons with prejudiced minds or who knew little practically of slavery as\r\nit existed in the South. Such was the intolerance of the public sentiment\r\nwhich had been fostered in both countries upon the subject, that no candid\r\nand impartial account of the workings of domestic slavery as it existed\r\nin the Southern states would be received with the slightest favor, whilst\r\nthe exaggerated accounts of cruelty practiced by the slave-owners, and\r\nconsequent sufferings of the slaves were eagerly accepted as the truth.\r\n\r\nA very striking evidence of this prejudice was furnished by the reception\r\ngiven to the works of two female writers not many years since. The one,\r\nMiss Harriett Beecher, later Mrs. Stowe, wrote a work of fiction called\r\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" containing misrepresentations of slavery and slanders\r\nupon Southern society. Drawing upon a fertile imagination and pandering\r\nto the prejudices of the uninformed, she published the book, which had a\r\ngreat run in Europe as well as America, and was translated into almost\r\nall of the continental languages. The incidents contained in the book\r\nwere either erroneous in point of fact or greatly exaggerated, but the\r\nbook itself was still more untrue as a picture of Southern society and\r\nslavery, and would have been a misrepresentation if every fact contained\r\nin it had been true in isolated cases. But the book was received as a\r\ntrue and faithful picture of society and slavery in the South, not merely\r\nby the agitators of abolition, but by that very considerable class of\r\npersons in the world who allow others to do their thinking, and when the\r\nauthoress visited Great Britain, she was treated with great attention and\r\nextensively feted by the nobility, gentry and others. The view of Southern\r\nslavery which she drew is perhaps accepted by nine-tenths of the otherwise\r\nwell informed persons in Europe.\r\n\r\nIn remarkable contrast to Miss Beecher's case, was that of Miss Murray, a\r\nlady of talents and refinement, who held the position of maid of honor to\r\nQueen Victoria. Miss Murray visited the United States as a tourist with\r\nall of her predilections against slavery, but she happened to be one of\r\nthose persons who, not satisfied with hearsay report, took the necessary\r\ntrouble to inform herself intelligently upon the subject. In the course\r\nof her travels, she went into the Southern states, where she remained for\r\nsome time as a guest on some of the plantations. She had the opportunity\r\nof observing the workings of domestic slavery as it actually existed and\r\nin all of its details, and she availed herself of that opportunity to make\r\nher own reflections. In letters to friends at home she gave the result\r\nof her actual observations and upon her return to England was induced to\r\npublish her letters. These letters represented slavery in the Southern\r\nstates in a very different light from that in which it was accustomed to\r\nbe presented to the British public, and the consequence was that Miss\r\nMurray was notified by the ministry that it was not desirable that she\r\nshould longer occupy the relation she held to the Queen, as the views she\r\nexpressed in regard to slavery were not consonant with the policy of the\r\nBritish government; so she was retired.\r\n\r\nThis illustrates the difference in the reception of two works on the\r\nsubject of slavery given by the British public: one a work of fiction from\r\na prejudiced writer, the other a matter-of-fact account of an eye witness\r\nof what she undertook to describe.\r\n\r\nIf British ministers could thus view the subject and be guilty of the\r\ninjustice they perpetrated in Miss Murray's case, what could be expected\r\nof the great mass of British readers? It is hard to conceive how the\r\nglory or prosperity of a nation could be advanced by giving currency to\r\nfallacies, or suppressing the truth in regard to the actual condition of\r\nAfrican slavery in the Southern states.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that as Great Britain had had so much to do with fostering\r\nthe institution in those states, it would be rather gratifying, than\r\notherwise, to its ministers and its people, to know that the descendants\r\nof those who had been ravished from their native country by the cupidity\r\nof their predecessors, were in a contented and comfortable condition.\r\nBut such was not then \"the policy of the government\" and perhaps the\r\nphilanthropic disciple of Exeter Hall who callously passed by the misery,\r\nwant and immorality at her own door in the great city of London, while she\r\nshed tears over the imaginary woes pictured by Miss Beecher, would have\r\nbeen equally as indignant as the British ministers with Miss Murray for\r\nattempting to disabuse her of the delusion which caused those tears to\r\nflow.\r\n\r\nSuch is, and perhaps ever will be, the character of human philanthropy,\r\nthat it troubles itself more about the sufferings which exist a long way\r\noff or only in imagination, than those which are before its eyes. One\r\nweeps over the trials of the hero or heroine in a novel or a play, while\r\nwe pass the miserable child of want and sin in the street with perfect\r\nindifference. If slavery did not have its evils and its wrongs, it would\r\nnot be a human institution, and as long as \"man's inhumanity to man makes\r\ncountless thousands mourn,\" so long will evils and wrongs exist in every\r\nrelation of human society. These exist in the relation of governor and\r\ngoverned, parent and child, husband and wife, master and servant, employer\r\nand employed, neighbor and neighbor, and are not excluded even from the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nIt is not pretended therefore that some masters did not abuse their\r\nservants, but these were rare instances, more perhaps than in any other\r\nrelation of like, and if for no other reason, the great mass of masters\r\nwere induced to treat their slaves well, because it was their interest\r\nto do so. Let any one compare the condition of the African in his native\r\nland, with that of the slaves of the South before the violent abolition of\r\nslavery, and then say whether that institution, which had produced such a\r\nvast improvement in his condition was so great a wrong after all.[B]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote B: Note--Professor Draper, in his \"History of the American\r\n  Civil War\" thus represents the condition of the negro in his native\r\n  land. \"The Negro in Africa.\"\r\n\r\n  \"On the west coast of Africa, the true negro-land, the thermometer\r\n  not infrequently stands at 120° in the shade. For months together\r\n  it remains, night and day, above 80°. The year is divided into the\r\n  dry and the rainy season; the latter setting in with an incessant\r\n  drizzle, continues until May. It culminates in the most awful\r\n  thunderstorms and overwhelming rains. This is particularly the case\r\n  in the mountains. When the dry season has fairly begun a pestiferous\r\n  miasm is engendered from the vast quantities of vegetable matter\r\n  brought down into the low lands by torrents. From the fevers thus\r\n  arising the negroes themselves suffer severely.\r\n\r\n  \"Moisture and heat, thus so fatal in their consequences to man,\r\n  give to that country its amazing vegetable luxuriance. For hundreds\r\n  of square miles there is an impenetrable jungle, infested with\r\n  intolerable swarms of musquitoes. The interior is magnificently\r\n  wooded. The mangrove thickets that line the river banks upon the\r\n  coast are here replaced by a dark evergreen verdure, interspersed\r\n  with palms and aloes. A rank herbage obstructs the course of the\r\n  streams. The crocodile, hippopotamus, pelican find here a suitable\r\n  abode. Monkeys swarm in the woods; in the more gloomy recesses live\r\n  the chimpanzee, gorilla and other anthropoid apes approaching man\r\n  most closely in stature and habits of life. In the open land--the\r\n  prairie of equatorial Africa--game is infrequent; there are a few\r\n  antelopes and horned cattle, but no horses. Man--or perhaps more\r\n  truly woman--is the only beast of burden.\r\n\r\n  \"Plantains, sweet potatoes, cassava, pumpkins, ground-nuts, Indian\r\n  corn, the flesh of the deer, antelope, bear, snake, furnish to the\r\n  negro, his food. He lives in a hut constructed of bamboo or flakes\r\n  of bark, thatched with matting or palm leaves. His villages are\r\n  often palisaded. Too lazy, except when severely pressed, to attend\r\n  to the labors of the field, he compels his wives to plant the roots\r\n  or seeds, and gather the scanty harvest. In hunting and in war, his\r\n  main occupation, he relies upon cunning and will follow his prey with\r\n  surprising agility, crawling like a snake prone upon the ground. He\r\n  has little or no idea of property in land; slaves are his currency;\r\n  he makes his purchase and pays his debts with them. 'A slave is\r\n  a note of hand that may be discounted or pawned. He is a bill of\r\n  exchange that carries himself to his destination, and pays a debt\r\n  bodily. He is a tax that walks corporeally into the chieftain's\r\n  treasury.'\r\n\r\n  \"Ferocious in his amours, the African negro has no sentiment of\r\n  love. The more wives he possesses the richer he is. If he inclines\r\n  to traffic, each additional father-in-law is an additional trading\r\n  connection; if devoted to war, an ally. His animal passions too often\r\n  disdain all such mercenary suggestions; he brings home new wives for\r\n  the sake of new gratifications. Fond of ornaments, his prosperity is\r\n  displayed in thick bracelets and anklets of iron or brass. An old\r\n  European hat or a tattered dress-coat, without any other article of\r\n  clothing is a sufficient badge of kingship. He inclines to nocturnal\r\n  habits. He will spend all the night lolling with his companions on\r\n  the ground at a blazing fire, though the thermometer may be at more\r\n  than 80°, occupying himself in smoking native tobacco, drinking\r\n  palm wine and telling stories about witches and spirits. He is an\r\n  inveterate gambler, a jester and a buffoon. He knows nothing of\r\n  hero-worship; his religion is a worship of fetiches.\r\n\r\n  \"They are such objects as the fingers and tails of monkeys, human\r\n  hair, skin, teeth, bones, old nails, copper chains, claws and skulls\r\n  of birds, seeds of plants. He believes that evil spirits walk at\r\n  the sunset hour by the edge of forests; he adores the devil, who\r\n  is thought to haunt burial-grounds and, in mortal terror of his\r\n  enmity, leaves food for him in the woods. He welcomes the new moon\r\n  by dancing in her shine. Whatever misfortune or sickness befalls\r\n  him, he imputes to sorcery and punishes the detected wizard or\r\n  witch with death. He determines guilt by the ordeal of fire: the\r\n  accused who can seize a red-hot copper ring without being burned is\r\n  innocent. His medicine-man--a wind raiser and rain-maker--pursues\r\n  his main business of exorcism in a head-dress of black feathers,\r\n  with a string of spirit-charms around his neck and a basket of\r\n  snake-bone incantations. The more advanced tribes have already risen\r\n  to idol worship; they adore grotesque figures of the human form, and\r\n  following the course through which intelligence in other races has\r\n  passed, they have wooden gods who can speak and nod and wink.\r\n\r\n  \"In this deplorable, this benighted condition, the negro nevertheless\r\n  shows tokens of a capacity for better things. He is an eager trader,\r\n  and knows the value of his ebony, bar-wood, beeswax, palm oil,\r\n  ivory. He has learned how to cheat; nay, more, infrequently he can\r\n  out-cheat the white man. He can adulterate the caoutchouc and other\r\n  products he brings down to the coast and pass them off as pure. His\r\n  color secures him from the detection of a blush when he lies. Though\r\n  utterly ignorant of any conception of art, he is not unskillful in\r\n  the manufacture of cooking pots and tobacco pipes of clay; he has a\r\n  bellows-forge of his own invention; he can reduce iron from its ores\r\n  and manufacture it. He makes shields of elephants' hide, cross-bows,\r\n  and other weapons of war. But in the construction of musical\r\n  instruments his skill is chiefly displayed. From drums of goat-skins,\r\n  from harps and gourds, he extracts their melancholy sounds and\r\n  disturbs the nocturnal African forests with his plaintive melodies.\r\n\r\n  \"It has been affirmed by those who have known them well, that\r\n  the equatorial negro tribes do not increase but tend to die out\r\n  spontaneously. This is attributed to infanticide and to the ravages\r\n  of miasmic fever, which in its most malignant form will often destroy\r\n  its victim in a single day. Even though quinine be taken as a\r\n  prophylactic no white man can enter their country with impunity. The\r\n  night dews are absolutely mortal.\"]\r\n\r\nThe most conclusive answer to all the slanders against Southern slave\r\nowners is to be found in the rapid multiplication of the slaves by natural\r\nincrease, which could not have taken place if such barbarities had been\r\npracticed or such immorality had existed, as has been represented. Our\r\ndetractors have convicted themselves of the slanders they have uttered\r\nby taking the Southern slave from the Cotton fields to the ballot box\r\nand vested him with all the privileges of an American citizen. If the\r\ninstitution of slavery has so tutored the negro that immediately his bonds\r\nare loosened, he is qualified for the privileges of the ballot box, what\r\na civilizing tendency that institution must have had. If on the contrary\r\nthat institution has kept him in utter ignorance of moral and Christian\r\nduty and made him the cringing, degraded creature he has been represented,\r\nwhat a monster must be he who proposes to vest in the untutored savage the\r\npower of governing others while the white man is disfranchised. In his\r\nnative land he has never reached the dignity of a civilized being, and he\r\nhas never been civilized until transplanted into slavery. Even till this\r\nday there are native Africans who continue in a state of barbarism despite\r\nthe civilizing influence of the British government and the efforts of\r\nmissionaries. In the western country away from the coast and civilization,\r\ntribes of the \"hinterland\" practice cannibalistic rites, the victim being\r\npreferably a blood relation of the sacrificer. The unfortunates are\r\nkidnapped, then with ghoulish ceremony and weird incantations they are\r\nfrightfully mutilated; while life still remains a demoniacal feast is held\r\nand human flesh consumed to offset the \"Ju-Ju\" or spell of evil omen. Then\r\nthe victim is put out of his misery and buried so that the white man shall\r\nknow nothing of the mysteries ages old, which the tribes of Africa revere;\r\nmany of the victims are young women and girls, captured by members of\r\nsecret societies and taken to some remote spot in the bush.\r\n\r\nWhatever of eminence any individual of the race has attained, is due\r\ndirectly or indirectly to the civilizing influence of the institution\r\nof slavery. It was the master of slaves who accomplished the greatest\r\nmissionary success and the progress of his ward since is due to the\r\ntraining and influence of the past.\r\n\r\nForeign people have said that if the Confederate Government had freed the\r\nslaves, it might have been recognized by European nations. Such persons\r\nshould recall that when Don Quixote freed the galley slaves he had then to\r\ndefend himself against them--they would see the absurdity of such an idea.\r\nWhat could the people of the South have done in the prosecution of the war\r\nif 3,000,000 slaves had been turned loose among them and the whole labor\r\nsystem of the country deranged?\r\n\r\nOur victors say that having submitted \"to the arbitrament of arms,\" and\r\nhaving been overcome, the question of right has been decided against\r\nus, and that we are a conquered people who must submit to the fate of\r\nthe conquered; but though the gordian knot was cut with the sword,\r\nconstitutional questions cannot be solved in the same way, such a\r\nview would but prove the wrong of the whole doctrine of coercion. The\r\nConstitution created by sovereign states, whatever the powers delegated,\r\ncould never have contemplated the possibility of one of those states\r\nbeing reduced to the condition of a conquered province. That Constitution\r\nwas as binding in those states, which remained after the secession of\r\nthe Southern states as before, and it was as much an outrage to make war\r\nupon those latter for the act of secession, as it would have been to have\r\ndestroyed their existence as states while they remained in the Union.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the South claimed to be a sovereign independent people\r\nafter their withdrawal, and were so by every principle of right and\r\njustice, but that position did not authorize the making of war against\r\nthem. A counter-claim was that the seceding states had no right to\r\nwithdraw, and therefore those arrayed in opposition undertook to compel\r\nthem to submission to the rule and laws of the Union: upon that ground\r\nalone could they justify the war. They were the aggressors and disregarded\r\nthe Constitution and the Union and they also were the ones who violated\r\nthe principle and precept of that Constitution, which they were sworn to\r\nsupport and defend.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine has been broached that the highest law that can exist is\r\nthat established by force of arms. That the red-handed conquerors or the\r\narmed robber on the highway should assert this, is not to be wondered at,\r\nbut when it comes from the men who have been compelled to yield to force\r\nof arms while struggling for the right, the mantle of charity should be\r\nallowed to fall over the weakness which cannot resist the temptations of\r\nadversity.\r\n\r\nIn regard to this question of submitting our rights to \"the arbitrament of\r\narms,\" much irrational language has been used and very erroneous opinions\r\nhave been expressed as to the result. There was never a greater mistake\r\nof terms or perversion of language than that made in saying that the\r\nSouthern states submitted their right to be withdrawn from the Union to\r\nthe arbitrament of arms or having lost, that the question of right has\r\nbeen decided against them. Those states proposed to withdraw peaceably,\r\ntendered a peaceful solution of all of the questions which might arise out\r\nof their former relations to the United States government. That government\r\ndeclared a war of coercion, and the Southern states of necessity resorted\r\nto arms to defend their rights and homes when most wrongfully and unjustly\r\ninvaded. In no sense can they be said to have submitted any of their\r\nrights to the arbitrament of arms any more than the traveller on the\r\nhighway submits his money to the arbitrament of arms between himself and\r\nthe robber, and the result of the war decided no question of principle,\r\nbut simply furnished another instance of the fact that in this world, the\r\ntruth does not always prevail and that might is often more powerful than\r\nright.\r\n\r\nNot only has the question of right not been decided by the arbitrament of\r\narms, but the proposition that \"The voice of the people is the voice of\r\nGod\" is no better established now than on that memorable occasion when the\r\npeople cried \"crucify him! crucify him!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n=ERRATA=\r\n\r\n  Page 51, line 17--\r\n    \"obitu\" should be \"obitur.\"\r\n\r\n  Page 58, lines 15 and 19--\r\n    \"Elden\" should be \"Eldon.\"\r\n\r\n  Page 77, line 11--\r\n    the letter \"a\" should be inserted before the word \"felony.\"\r\n\r\n  Page 82, line 26--\r\n    \"interferfence\" should be \"interference.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber Note\r\n\r\nMinor typos were corrected.
