Lives of Mussolini written by\r\nothers have interests of sorts.\r\n\r\n“But nothing can take the place of a book which you will write\r\nyourself,” I said to him.\r\n\r\n“Write myself?” He leaned across his desk and repeated my phrase in\r\namazement.\r\n\r\nHe is the busiest single individual in the world. He appeared hurt as\r\nif a friend had failed to understand.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said and showed him a series of headings I had written on a\r\nfew sheets of paper.\r\n\r\n“All right,” he said in English. “I will.”\r\n\r\nIt was quite like him. He decides quickly and completely.\r\n\r\nSo he began. He dictated. I advised that method because when he\r\nattempts to write in longhand he corrects and corrects and corrects.\r\nIt would have been too much for him. So he dictated. The copy came back\r\nand he interlined the manuscript in his own hand—a dash of red pencil,\r\nand a flowing rivulet of ink—here and there.\r\n\r\nWhen the manuscripts began to come to me I was troubled because mere\r\nliteral translators lose the vigor of the man himself.\r\n\r\n“What editing may I do?” I asked him.\r\n\r\n“Any that you like,” he said. “You know Italy, you understand Fascism,\r\nyou see me, as clearly as any one.”\r\n\r\nBut there was nothing much to do. The story came through as it appears\r\nhere. It is all his and—what luck for all of us—so like him! Approve\r\nof him or not, when one reads this book one may know Mussolini or at\r\nleast, if one’s vision is clouded, know him better. Like the book or\r\nnot, there is not an insincere line in it. I find none.\r\n\r\nOf course there are many things which a man writing an autobiography\r\ncannot see about himself or will not say about himself.\r\n\r\nHe is unlikely to speak of his own size on the screen of history.\r\n\r\nPerhaps when approval or disapproval, theories and isms, pros and\r\ncons, are all put aside the only true measure of a man’s greatness\r\nfrom a wholly unpartisan view-point may be found in the answer to this\r\nquestion:\r\n\r\n“How deep and lasting has been the effect of a man upon the largest\r\nnumber of human beings—their hearts, their thoughts, their material\r\nwelfare, their relation to the universe?”\r\n\r\nIn our time it may be shrewdly forecast that no man will exhibit\r\ndimensions of permanent greatness equal to those of Mussolini.\r\n\r\nAdmire him or not, approve his philosophies or not, concede the\r\npermanence of his success or not, consider him superman or not, as\r\nyou may, he has put to a working test, on great and growing numbers\r\nof mankind, programmes, unknown before, in applied spirituality,\r\nin applied plans, in applied leadership, in applied doctrines, in\r\nthe applied principle that contents are more important than labels\r\non bottles. He has not only been able to secure and hold an almost\r\nuniversal following; he has built a new state upon a new concept of a\r\nstate. He has not only been able to change the lives of human beings\r\nbut he has changed their minds, their hearts, their spirits. He has not\r\nmerely ruled a house; he has built a new house.\r\n\r\nHe has not merely put it on paper or into orations; he has laid the\r\nbricks.\r\n\r\nIt is one thing to administer a state. The one who does this well is\r\ncalled statesman. It is quite another thing to make a state. Mussolini\r\nhas made a state. That is super-statesmanship.\r\n\r\nI knew him before the world at large, outside of Italy, had ever heard\r\nof him; I knew him before and after the moment he leaped into the\r\nsaddle and in the days when he, almost single-handed, was clearing away\r\nchaos’ own junk pile from Italy.\r\n\r\nBut no man knows Mussolini. An Italian newspaper offered a prize for\r\nthe best essay showing insight into the mystery of the man. Mussolini,\r\nso the story goes, stopped the contest by writing to the paper that\r\nsuch a competition was absurd, because he himself could not enter an\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nIn spite of quick, firm decisions, in spite of grim determination, in\r\nspite of a well-ordered diagrammed pattern and plan of action fitted to\r\nany moment of time, Mussolini, first of all, above all and after all,\r\nis a personality always in a state of flux, adjusting its leadership to\r\na world eternally in a state of flux.\r\n\r\nChange the facts upon which Mussolini has acted and he will change his\r\naction. Change the hypotheses and he will change his conclusion.\r\n\r\nAnd this perhaps is an attribute of greatness seldom recognized. Most\r\nof us are forever hoping to put our world in order and finish the job.\r\nStatesmen with some idea to make over into reality hope for a day when\r\nthey can say: “Well, that’s done!” And when it is done,—often enough it\r\nis nothing. The bridges they have built are now useless, because the\r\nrivers have all changed their courses and humanity is already shrieking\r\nfor new bridges. This is not an unhappy thought, says Mussolini. A\r\nfinished world would be a stupid place—intolerably stupid.\r\n\r\nThe imagination of mere statesmen covers a static world.\r\n\r\nThe imagination of true greatness covers a dynamic world. Mussolini\r\nconceives a dynamic world. He is ready to go on the march with\r\nit, though it overturns all his structures, upsets all his theories,\r\ndestroys all of yesterday and creates a screaming dawn of a to-morrow.\r\n\r\nOpportunist is a term of reproach used to brand men who fit themselves\r\nto conditions for reasons of self-interest. Mussolini, as I have\r\nlearned to know him, is an opportunist in the sense that he believes\r\nthat mankind itself must be fitted to changing conditions rather than\r\nto fixed theories, no matter how many hopes and prayers have been\r\nexpended on theories and programmes.\r\n\r\nHe has marched up several hills with the thousands and then marched\r\ndown again. This strange creature of strange life and strange thoughts,\r\nwith that almost psychopathic fire which was in saints and villains,\r\nin Napoleons, in Jeanne d’Arcs and in Tolstoys, in religious prophets\r\nand in Ingersolls, has been up the Socialist, the international, the\r\nliberal and the conservative hills and down again. He says: “The\r\nsanctity of an ism is not in the ism; it has no sanctity beyond its\r\npower to do, to work, to succeed in practice. It may have succeeded\r\nyesterday and fail to-morrow. Failed yesterday and succeed to-morrow.\r\nThe machine first of all must run!”\r\n\r\nI have watched, with a curiosity that has never failed to creep in on\r\nme, the marked peculiarities, physical and mental, of this man. At\r\nmoments he is quite relaxed, at ease; and yet the unknown gusts of his\r\nown personality play on him eternally. One sees in his eyes, or in a\r\nquick movement of his body, or in a sentence suddenly ejaculated, the\r\neffect of these gusts, just as one sees wind on the surface of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThere is in his walk something of a prowl, a faint suggestion of\r\nthe tread of the cat. He likes cats—their independence, their decision,\r\ntheir sense of justice and their appreciation of the sanctity of the\r\nindividual. He even likes lions and lionesses, and plays with them\r\nuntil those who guard his life protest against their social set.\r\nHis principal pet is a Persian feline which, being of aristocratic\r\nlineage, nevertheless exhibits a pride not only of ancestry but,\r\ncondescendingly, of belonging to Mussolini. And yet, in spite of his\r\nown prowl, as he walks along in his riding-boots, springy, active,\r\nready to leap, it seems, there is little else feline about him. One\r\nquality is feline, however—it is the sense of his complete isolation.\r\nOne feels that he must always have had this isolation—isolation as a\r\nboy, isolation as a young radical, adventurer, lover, worker, thinker.\r\n\r\nThere is no understudy of Mussolini. There is no man, woman, or child\r\nwho stands anywhere in the inner orbit of his personality. No one. The\r\nonly possible exception is his daughter Edda. All the tales of his\r\nalliances, his obligations, his ties, his predilections are arrant\r\nnonsense. There are none—no ties, no predilections, no alliances, no\r\nobligations unpaid.\r\n\r\nFinancially? Lying voices said that he had been personally financed and\r\nbacked by the industrialists of Italy. This is ridiculous to those who\r\nknow. His salary is almost nothing. His own family—wife, children, are\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nPolitically? Whom could he owe? He has made and can unmake them all.\r\nHe is free to test every officeholder in the whole of Italy by the\r\nyardstick of service and fitness. Beyond that I know not one political\r\ndebt that he owes. He has tried to pay those of the past; I believe\r\nthat the cynicism in him is based upon the failure of some who have\r\nbeen rewarded to live up to the trust put in them.\r\n\r\n“But I take the responsibility for all,” says he. He says it publicly\r\nwith jaws firm; he says it privately with eyes somewhat saddened.\r\n\r\nHe takes responsibility for everything—for discipline, for censorship,\r\nfor measures which, were less rigor required, would appear repressive\r\nand cruel. “Mine!” says he, and stands or falls on that. It is an\r\nadmirable courage. I could, if I wished, quote instance after instance\r\nof this acceptance—sometimes when he is not to blame—of the whole\r\nresponsibility of the machine.\r\n\r\n“Mine!” says he.\r\n\r\nAnd in spite of any disillusionment he has suffered since I knew him\r\nfirst, he has retained his laugh—often, one is bound to say, a scornful\r\nlaugh—and he has kept his faith in an ability to build up a machine—the\r\nmachine of Fascism—the machine built not on any fixed theory but one\r\nintended by Mussolini to run—above all, to run, to function, to do, to\r\naccomplish, to fill the bottles with wine first, unlike the other isms,\r\nand put the labels on after.\r\n\r\nMussolini has superstitious faith in himself. He has said it. Not a\r\nfaith in himself to make a personal gain. An assassin’s bullet might\r\nwipe him out and leave his family in poverty. That would be that.\r\nHis faith is in a kind of destiny which will allow him, before\r\nthe last chapter, to finish the building of this new state, this new\r\nmachine—“the machine which will run and has a soul.”\r\n\r\nThe first time I ever saw him he came to my residence sometime before\r\nthe march on Rome and I asked him what would be his programme for\r\nItaly. His answer was immediate: “Work and discipline.”\r\n\r\nI remember I thought at that time that the phrase sounded a little\r\nevangelical, a phrase of exhortation. But a mere demagogue would\r\nnever choose it. Wilson’s slogans of Rights and Peace and Freedom are\r\nmuch more popular and gain easier currency than sterner phrases. It\r\nis easier even for a sincere preacher, to offer soft nests to one’s\r\nfollowers; it is more difficult to excite enthusiasm for stand-up\r\ndoctrines. Any analysis and weighing of Mussolini’s greatness must\r\ninclude recognition that he has made popular throughout a race of\r\npeople, and perhaps for others, a standard of obligation of the\r\nindividual not only exacting but one which in the end will be accepted\r\nvoluntarily. Not only is it accepted voluntarily but with an almost\r\nspiritual ecstasy which has held up miraculously in Italy during years,\r\nwhen all the so-called liberals in the world were hovering over it like\r\nvultures, croaking that if it were not dead it was about to die.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to lead men at all. It is still more difficult to lead\r\nthem away from self-indulgence. It is still more difficult to lead them\r\nso that a new generation, so that youth itself, appears as if born with\r\na new spirit, a new virility bred in the bones. It is difficult\r\nto govern a state and difficult to deal cleanly and strongly with a\r\nstatic programme applied to a static world; but it is more difficult\r\nto build a new state and deal cleanly and strongly with a dynamic\r\nprogramme applied to a dynamic world.\r\n\r\nThis man, who looks up at me with that peculiar nodding of his head\r\nand raising of the eyebrows, has done it. There are few in the world’s\r\nhistory who have. I had considered the phrase “Work and discipline”\r\nas a worthy slogan, as a good label for an empty bottle. Within six\r\nyears this man, with a professional opposition which first barked like\r\nPomeranians at his heels and then ran away to bark abroad, has made the\r\nlabel good, has filled the bottle, has turned concept into reality.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible for those who oppose the concept to say that the\r\nreality of the new spirit of Italy and its extent of full acceptance by\r\nthe people may exist in the mind of Mussolini, but does not spring out\r\nof the people themselves but it is quite untrue as all know who really\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nHe throws up his somewhat stubby, meaty, short-fingered hands, strong\r\nand yet rather ghostlike when one touches them, and laughs. Like\r\nRoosevelt. No one can spend much time with him without thinking that\r\nafter all there are two kinds of leaders—outdoor and indoor leaders—and\r\nthat the first are somewhat more magnetic, more lasting and more boyish\r\nand likable for their power than the indoor kind.\r\n\r\nMussolini, like Roosevelt, gives the impression of an energy\r\nwhich cannot be bottled, which bubbles up and over like an eternally\r\neffervescent, irrepressible fluid. At these moments one remembers his\r\nplaying of the violin, his fencing, his playful, mischievous humour,\r\nthe dash of his courage, his contact with animals, his success in\r\nmaking gay marching songs for the old drab struggles of mankind with\r\nthe soil, with the elements, with ores in the earth, and the pathways\r\nof the seas. In the somber conclusions of the student statesman and\r\nin the sweetness of the sentimentalist statesman there is little joy;\r\nunexpected joy is found in the leadership of a Mussolini. Battle\r\nbecomes a game. The game becomes a romp. It is absurd to say that Italy\r\ngroans under discipline. Italy chortles with it! It is victory!\r\n\r\nHe is a Spartan too. Perhaps we need them in the world to-day;\r\nespecially that type whose first interest is the development of the\r\npower and the happiness of a race.\r\n\r\nThe last time I took leave of Mussolini he came prowling across the\r\nroom as I went toward the door. His scowl had gone. The evening had\r\ncome. There had been a half hour of quiet conversation. The strained\r\nexpression had fallen from his face. He came toward me and rubbed his\r\nshoulder against the wall. He was relaxed and quiet.\r\n\r\nI remembered Lord Curzon’s impatience with him long ago, when Mussolini\r\nhad first come into power, and Curzon used to refer to him as “that\r\nabsurd man.”\r\n\r\nTime has shown that he was neither violent nor absurd. Time has\r\nshown that he is both wise and humane.\r\n\r\nIt takes the world a long time to see what has been dropped into the\r\npan of its old scales!\r\n\r\nIn terms of fundamental and permanent effect upon the largest number of\r\nhuman beings—whether one approves or detests him—the Duce is now the\r\ngreatest figure of this sphere and time. One closes the door when one\r\nleaves him, feeling, as when Roosevelt was left, that one could squeeze\r\nsomething of him out of one’s clothes.\r\n\r\nHe is a mystic to himself.\r\n\r\nI imagine, as he reaches forth to touch reality in himself, he finds\r\nthat he himself has gone a little forward, isolated, determined,\r\nillusive, untouchable, just out of reach—onward!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                           A SULPHUROUS LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost all the books published about me put squarely and logically on\r\nthe first page that which may be called my birth certificate. It is\r\nusually taken from my own notes.\r\n\r\nWell, then here it is again. I was born on July 29, 1883, at Varano di\r\nCosta. This is an old hamlet. It is on a hill. The houses are of stone,\r\nand sunlight and shade give these walls and roofs a variegated color\r\nwhich I well remember. The hamlet, where the air is pure and the view\r\nagreeable, overlooks the village of Dovia, and Dovia is in the commune,\r\nor county, of Predappio in the northeast of Italy.\r\n\r\nIt was at two o’clock Sunday afternoon when I came into the world. It\r\nwas by chance the festival day of the patron saint of the old church\r\nand parish of Caminate. On the structure a ruined tower overlooks\r\nproudly and solemnly the whole plain of Forli—a plain which slopes\r\ngently down from the Apennines, with their snow-clad tops in winter, to\r\nthe undulating bottoms of Ravaldino, where the mists gather in summer\r\nnights.\r\n\r\nLet me add to the atmosphere of a country dear to me by bringing again\r\nto my memory the old district of Predappio. It was a country well known\r\nin the thirteenth century, giving birth to illustrious families\r\nduring the Renaissance. It is a sulphurous land. From it the ripening\r\ngrapes make a strong wine of fine perfume. There are many springs of\r\niodine waters. And on that plain and those undulating foothills and\r\nmountain spurs, the ruins of mediæval castles and towers thrust up\r\ntheir gray-yellow walls toward the pale blue sky in testimony of the\r\nvirility of centuries now gone.\r\n\r\nSuch was the land, dear to me because it was my soil. Race and soil are\r\nstrong influences upon us all.\r\n\r\nAs for my race—my origin—many persons have studied and analyzed its\r\nhereditary aspects. There is nothing very difficult in tracing my\r\ngenealogy, because from parish records it is very easy for friendly\r\nresearch to discover that I came from a lineage of honest people. They\r\ntilled the soil, and because of its fertility they earned the right to\r\ntheir share of comfort and ease.\r\n\r\nGoing further back, one finds that the Mussolini family was prominent\r\nin the city of Bologna in the thirteenth century. In 1270 Giovanni\r\nMussolini was the leader of this warlike, aggressive commune. His\r\npartner in the rule of Bologna in the days of armored knights was\r\nFulcieri Paolucci de Calboli, who belonged to a family from Predappio\r\nalso, and even to-day that is one of the distinguished families.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  The house at Varano di Costa, in Predappio, where\r\n  Mussolini was born.]\r\n\r\nThe destinies of Bologna and the internal struggles of its parties and\r\nfactions, following the eternal conflicts and changes in all struggles\r\nfor power, caused, at last, the exile of the Mussolinis to Argelato.\r\nFrom there they scattered into neighboring provinces. One may be\r\nsure that in that era their adventures were varied and sometimes in\r\nthe flux of fortune brought them to hard times. I have never discovered\r\nnews of my forbears in the seventeenth century. In the eighteenth\r\ncentury there was a Mussolini in London. Italians never hesitate to\r\nventure abroad with their genius or their labors. The London Mussolini\r\nwas a composer of music of some note and perhaps it is from him that\r\nI inherit the love of the violin, which even to-day in my hands gives\r\ncomfort to moments of relaxation and creates for me moments of release\r\nfrom the realities of my days.\r\n\r\nLater, in the nineteenth century, the family tie became more clearly\r\ndefined; my own grandfather was a lieutenant of the National Guard.\r\n\r\nMy father was a blacksmith—a heavy man with strong, large, fleshy\r\nhands. Alessandro the neighbors called him. Heart and mind were always\r\nfilled and pulsing with socialistic theories. His intense sympathies\r\nmingled with doctrines and causes. He discussed them in the evening\r\nwith his friends and his eyes filled with light. The international\r\nmovement attracted him and he was closely associated with names known\r\namong the followers of social causes in Italy—Andrea Costa, Balducci,\r\nAmilcare, Cipriani and even the more tender and pastoral spirit of\r\nGiovanni Pascoli. So come and go men whose minds and souls are striving\r\nfor good ends. Each conference seems to them to touch the fate of the\r\nworld; each talisman seems to promise salvation; each theory pretends\r\nto immortality.\r\n\r\nThe Mussolinis had left some permanent marks. In Bologna there\r\nis still a street named for that family and not long ago a tower\r\nand a square bore the name. Somewhere in the heraldic records\r\nthere is the Mussolini coat of arms. It has a rather pleasing and\r\nperhaps magnificent design. There are six black figures in a yellow\r\nfield—symbols of valor, courage, force.\r\n\r\nMy childhood, now in the mists of distance, still yields those flashes\r\nof memory that come back with a familiar scene, an aroma which the\r\nnose associates with damp earth after a rain in the springtime, or the\r\nsound of footsteps in the corridor. A roll of thunder may bring back\r\nthe recollection of the stone steps where a little child who seems no\r\nlonger any part of oneself used to play in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nOut of those distant memories I receive no assurance that I had the\r\ncharacteristics which are supposed traditionally to make parents\r\noverjoyed at the perfection of their offspring. I was not a good\r\nboy, nor did I stir the family pride or the dislike of my own young\r\nassociates in school by standing at the head of my class.\r\n\r\nI was then a restless being; I am still.\r\n\r\nThen I could not understand why it is necessary to take time in order\r\nto act. Rest for restfulness meant nothing to me then any more than now.\r\n\r\nI believe that in those youthful years, just as now, my day began and\r\nended with an act of will—by will put into action.\r\n\r\nLooking back, I cannot see my early childhood as being either\r\npraiseworthy or as being more than normal in every direction. I\r\nremember my father as a dark-haired, good-natured man, not slow\r\nto laugh, with strong features and steady eyes. I remember that near\r\nthe house where I was born, with its stone wall with moss green in\r\nthe crevices, there was a small brook and farther on a little river.\r\nNeither had much water in it, but in autumn and other seasons when\r\nthere were unexpected heavy rains they swelled in fury and their\r\ntorrents were joyous challenges to me. I remember them as my first\r\nplay spots. With my brother, Arnaldo, who is now the publisher of the\r\ndaily _Popolo d’Italia_, I used to try my skill as a builder of dams\r\nto regulate the current. When birds were in their nesting season I was\r\na frantic hunter for their concealed and varied homes with their eggs\r\nor young birds. Vaguely I sensed in all this the rhythm of natural\r\nprogress—a peep into a world of eternal wonder, of flux and change. I\r\nwas passionately fond of young life; I wished to protect it then as I\r\ndo now.\r\n\r\nMy greatest love was for my mother. She was so quiet, so tender,\r\nand yet so strong. Her name was Rosa. My mother not only reared us\r\nbut she taught primary school. I often thought, even in my earliest\r\nappreciation of human beings, of how faithful and patient her work was.\r\nTo displease her was my one fear. So, to hide from her my pranks, my\r\nnaughtiness or some result of mischievous frolic, I used to enlist my\r\ngrandmother and even the neighbors, for they understood my panic lest\r\nmy mother should be disturbed.\r\n\r\nThe alphabet was my first practice in worldly affairs and I learned it\r\nin a rush of enthusiasm. Without knowing why, I found myself wishing\r\nto attend school—the school at Predappio, some two miles away. It was\r\ntaught by Marani, a friend of my father. I walked to and fro and was\r\nnot displeased that the boys of Predappio resented at first the coming\r\nof a stranger boy from another village. They flung stones at me and\r\nI returned their fire. I was all alone and against many. I was often\r\nbeaten, but I enjoyed it with that universality of enjoyment with which\r\nboys the world around make friendship by battle and arrive at affection\r\nthrough missiles. Whatever was my courage, my body bore its imprints. I\r\nconcealed the bruises from my mother to shelter her from the knowledge\r\nof the world in which I had begun to find expression and to which I\r\nsupposed she was such a stranger. At the evening repast I probably\r\noften feared to stretch out my hand for the bread lest I expose a wound\r\nupon my young wrist.\r\n\r\nAfter a while this all ended. War was over and the pretense of enmity—a\r\nform of play—faded into nothing and I had found fine schoolmates of my\r\nown age.\r\n\r\nThe call of old life foundations is strong. I felt it when only a few\r\nyears ago a terrific avalanche endangered the lives of the inhabitants\r\nof Predappio. I took steps to found a new Predappio—Predappio Nuovo.\r\nMy nature felt a stirring for my old home. And I remembered that as\r\na child I had sometimes looked at the plain where the River Rabbi is\r\ncrossed by the old highway to Mendola and imagined there a flourishing\r\ntown. To-day that town—Predappio Nuovo—is in full process of\r\ndevelopment; on its masonry gate there is carved the symbol of Fascism\r\nand words expressing my clear will.\r\n\r\nWhen I was graduated from the lower school I was sent to a boarding\r\nschool. This was at Faenza, the town noted for its pottery of the\r\nfifteenth century. The school was directed by the Salesiani priests. I\r\nwas about to enter into a period of routine, of learning the ways of\r\nthe disciplined human herd. I studied, slept well and grew. I was awake\r\nat daylight and went to bed when the evening had settled down and the\r\nbats flew.\r\n\r\nThis was a period of bursting beyond the bounds of my own little town.\r\nI had begun to travel. I had begun to add length after length to that\r\ntether which binds one to the hearth and the village.\r\n\r\nI saw the town of Forli—a considerable place which should have\r\nimpressed me but failed to do so. But Ravenna! Some of my mother’s\r\nrelatives lived in the plain of Ravenna and on one summer vacation we\r\nset out together to visit them. After all, it was not far away, but to\r\nmy imagination it was a great journey—almost like a journey of Marco\r\nPolo—to go over hill and dale to the edge of the sea—the Adriatic!\r\n\r\nI went with my mother to Ravenna and carefully visited every corner\r\nof that city steeped in the essences of antiquity. From the wealth\r\nof Ravenna’s artistic treasures there rose before me the beauty and\r\nfascination of her history and her name through the long centuries.\r\nDeep feelings remain now, impressed then upon me. I experienced a\r\nprofound and significant enlarging of my concepts of life, beauty\r\nand the rise of civilizations. The tomb of Dante, inspiring in its\r\nquiet hour of noon; the basilica of San Apollinare; the Candiano canal,\r\nwith the pointed sails of fishing-boats at its mouth; and then the\r\nbeauty of the Adriatic moved me—touched something within me.\r\n\r\nI went back with something new and undying. My mind and spirit were\r\nfilled with expanding consciousness. And I took back also a present\r\nfrom my relatives. It was a wild duck, powerful in flight. My brother\r\nArnaldo and I, on the little river at home, put forth patient efforts\r\nto tame the wild duck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                               MY FATHER\r\n\r\n\r\nMy father took a profound interest in my development. Perhaps I was\r\nmuch more observed by his paternal attention than I thought. We became\r\nmuch more knit together by common interests as my mind and body\r\napproached maturity. In the first place I became fascinated by the\r\nsteam threshing machines which were just then for the first time being\r\nintroduced into our agricultural life. With my father I went to work\r\nto learn the mechanism, and tasted, as I had never tasted before, the\r\nquiet joy of becoming a part of the working creative world. Machinery\r\nhas its fascinations and I can understand how an engineer of a railway\r\nlocomotive or an oiler in the hold of a ship may feel that a machine\r\nhas a personality, sometimes irritating, sometimes friendly, with an\r\ninexhaustible generosity and helpfulness, power and wisdom.\r\n\r\nBut manual labor in my father’s blacksmith shop was not the only\r\ncommon interest we shared. It was inevitable that I should find a\r\nclearer understanding of those political and social questions which\r\nin the midst of discussions with the neighbors had appeared to me as\r\nunfathomable, and hence a stupid world of words. I could not follow\r\nas a child the arguments of lengthy debates around the table, nor\r\ndid I grasp the reasons for the watchfulness and measures taken by the\r\npolice. But now in an obscure way it all appeared as connected with\r\nthe lives of strong men who not only dominate their own lives but also\r\nthe lives of their fellow creatures. Slowly but fatally I was turning\r\nmy spirit and my mind to new political ideals destined to flower for a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI began with young eyes to see that the tiny world about me was\r\nfeeling uneasiness under the pinch of necessity. A deep and secret\r\ngrudge was darkening the hearts of the common people. A country gentry\r\nof mediocrity in economic usefulness and of limited intellectual\r\ncontribution were hanging upon the multitudes a weight of unjustified\r\nprivileges. These were sad, dark years not only in my own province\r\nbut for other parts of Italy. I must have the marks upon my memory of\r\nthe resentful and furtive protests of those who came to talk with my\r\nfather, some with bitterness of facts, some with a newly devised hope\r\nfor some reform.\r\n\r\nIt was then, while I was still in my early teens, that my parents,\r\nafter many serious talks, ending with a rapid family counsel, turned\r\nthe rudder of my destiny in a new direction. They said that my manual\r\nwork did not correspond to their ambitions for me, to their ability to\r\naid me, nor did it fit my own capacities. My mother had a phrase which\r\nremains in my ears: “He promises something.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  _From a photograph by A. Badodi, Milan._\r\n  Mussolini’s mother and father, Rosa and Alessandro Mussolini.\r\n  ]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time I was not very enthusiastic about that conclusion; I had\r\nno real hunger for scholastic endeavor. I did not feel that I would\r\nlanguish if I did not go to a normal school and did not prepare\r\nto become a teacher. But my family were right. I had developed some\r\ncapacities as a student and could increase them.\r\n\r\nI went to the normal school at a place called Forlimpopoli. I remember\r\nmy arrival in that small city. The citizens were cheerful and\r\nindustrious, good at bargaining—tradesmen and middlemen. The school,\r\nhowever, had a greater distinction; it was conducted by Valfredo\r\nCarducci, brother of the great writer Giosue Carducci, who at that time\r\nwas harvesting his laurels because of his poetry and his inspiration\r\ndrawn from Roman classicism.\r\n\r\nThere was a long stretch of study ahead of me; to become a master—to\r\nhave a teacher’s diploma—meant six years of books and pencils, ink\r\nand paper. I confess that I was not very assiduous. The bright side\r\nof those years of preparation to be a teacher came from my interest\r\nin reforming educational methods, and even more in an interest begun\r\nat that time and maintained ever since, an intense interest in the\r\npsychology of human masses—the crowd.\r\n\r\nI was, I believe, unruly; and I was sometimes indiscreet. Youth has\r\nits passing restlessness and follies. Somehow I succeeded in gaining\r\nforgiveness. My masters were understanding and on the whole generous.\r\nBut I have never been able to make up my mind how much of the\r\nindulgence accorded to me came from any hope they had in me or how much\r\ncame from the fact that my father had acquired an increasing reputation\r\nfor his moral and political integrity.\r\n\r\nSo the diploma came to me at last. I was a teacher! Many are the\r\nmen who have found activity in political life who began as teachers.\r\nBut then I saw only the prospect of the hard road of job hunting,\r\nletters of recommendation, scraping up a backing of influential persons\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nIn a competition for a teacher’s place at Gualtieri, in the province\r\nof Reggio Emilia, I was successful. I had my taste of it. I taught\r\nfor a year. On the last day of the school year I dictated an essay. I\r\nremember its thesis. It was: “By Persevering You Arrive.” For that I\r\nobtained the praise of my superiors.\r\n\r\nSo school was closed. I did not want to go back to my family. There was\r\na narrow world for me, with affection to be sure, but restricted. There\r\nin Predappio one could neither move nor think without feeling at the\r\nend of a short rope. I had become conscious of myself, sensitive to my\r\nfuture. I felt the urge to escape.\r\n\r\nMoney I had not—merely a little. Courage was my asset. I would be an\r\nexile. I crossed the frontier; I entered Switzerland.\r\n\r\nIt was in this wander-life, now full of difficulties, toil, hardship\r\nand restlessness, that developed something in me. It was the milestone\r\nwhich marked my maturity. I entered into this new era as a man and\r\npolitician. My confident soul began to be my support. I conceded\r\nnothing to pious demagoguery. I allowed myself, humble as was my\r\nfigure, to be guided by my innate proudness and I saw myself in my own\r\nmental dress.\r\n\r\nTo this day I thank difficulties. They were more numerous than the\r\nnice, happy incidents. But the latter gave me nothing. The difficulties\r\nof life have hardened my spirit. They have taught me how to live.\r\n\r\nFor me it would have been dreadful and fatal if on my journey forward\r\nI had by chance fallen permanently into the chains of comfortable\r\nbureaucratic employment. How could I have adapted myself to that smug\r\nexistence in a world bristling with interest and significant horizons?\r\nHow could I have tolerated the halting progress of promotions,\r\ncomforted and yet irritated by the thoughts of an old-age pension at\r\nthe end of the dull road? Any comfortable cranny would have sapped my\r\nenergies. These energies which I enjoy were trained by obstacles and\r\neven by bitterness of soul. They were made by struggle, not by the joys\r\nof the pathway.\r\n\r\nMy stay in Switzerland was a welter of difficulties. It did not last\r\nlong, but it was angular, with harsh points. I worked with skill as a\r\nlaborer. I worked usually as a mason and felt the fierce, grim pleasure\r\nof construction. I made translations from Italian into French and vice\r\nversa. I did whatever came to hand. I looked upon my friends with\r\ninterest or affection or amusement.\r\n\r\nAbove all, I threw myself headforemost into the politics of the\r\nemigrant—of refugees, of those who sought solutions.\r\n\r\nIn politics I never gained a penny. I detest those who live like\r\nparasites, sucking away at the edges of social struggles. I hate men\r\nwho grow rich in politics.\r\n\r\nI knew hunger—stark hunger—in those days. But I never bent myself\r\nto ask for loans and I never tried to inspire the pity of those around\r\nme, nor of my own political companions. I reduced my needs to a minimum\r\nand that minimum—and sometimes less—I received from home.\r\n\r\nWith a kind of passion, I studied social sciences. Pareto was giving a\r\ncourse of lectures in Lausanne on political economy. I looked forward\r\nto every one. The mental exercise was a change from manual labor.\r\nMy mind leaped toward this change and I found pleasure in learning.\r\nFor here was a teacher who was outlining the fundamental economic\r\nphilosophy of the future.\r\n\r\nBetween one lesson and another I took part in political gatherings. I\r\nmade speeches. Some intemperance in my words made me undesirable to the\r\nSwiss authorities. They expelled me from two cantons. The university\r\ncourses were over. I was forced into new places, and not until 1922 at\r\nthe Conference of Lausanne, after I was Premier of Italy, did I see\r\nagain some of my old haunts, filled with memories colorful or drab.\r\n\r\nTo remain in Switzerland became impossible. There was the yearning\r\nfor home which blossoms in the hearts of all Italians. Furthermore,\r\nthe compulsory service in the army was calling me. I came back. There\r\nwere greetings, questions, all the incidents of the return of an\r\nadventurer—and then I joined the regiment—a Bersaglieri regiment at the\r\nhistoric city of Verona. The Bersaglieri wear green cock feathers in\r\ntheir hats; they are famous for their fast pace, a kind of monotonous\r\nand ground-covering dogtrot, and for their discipline and spirit.\r\n\r\nI liked the life of a soldier. The sense of willing subordination\r\nsuited my temperament. I was preceded by a reputation of being\r\nrestless, a fire eater, a radical, a revolutionist. Consider then the\r\nastonishment of the captain, the major, and my colonels, who were\r\ncompelled to speak of me with praise! It was my opportunity to show\r\nserenity of spirit and strength of character.\r\n\r\nVerona, where my regiment was garrisoned, was and always will remain a\r\ndear Venetian city, reverberating with the past, filled with suggestive\r\nbeauties. It found in my own temperament an echo of infinite resonance.\r\nI enjoyed its aromas as a man, but also as a private soldier I entered\r\nwith vim into all the drills and the most difficult exercises. I\r\nfound an affectionate regard for the mass, for the whole, made up of\r\nindividuals, for its maneuvers and the tactics, the practice of defense\r\nand attack.\r\n\r\nMy capacity was that of a simple soldier; but I used to weigh the\r\ncharacter, abilities and individualities of those who commanded me. All\r\nItalian soldiers to a certain extent do this. I learned in that way how\r\nimportant it is for an officer to have a deep knowledge of military\r\nmatters and to develop a fine sensitiveness to the ranks, and to\r\nappreciate in the masses of our men our stern Latin sense of discipline\r\nand to be susceptible to its enchantments.\r\n\r\nI can say that in every regard I was an excellent soldier. I might have\r\ntaken up the courses for noncommissioned officers. But destiny,\r\nwhich dragged me from my father’s blacksmith shop to teaching and from\r\nteaching to exile and from exile to discipline, now decreed that I\r\nshould not become a professional soldier. I had to ask for leave. At\r\nthe time I swallowed the greatest sorrow in my life; it was the death\r\nof my mother.\r\n\r\nOne day my captain took me aside. He was so considerate that I felt in\r\nadvance something impending. He asked me to read a telegram. It was\r\nfrom my father. My mother was dying! He urged my return. I rushed to\r\ncatch the first train.\r\n\r\nI arrived too late. My mother was in death’s agony. But from an almost\r\nimperceptible nod of her head I realized that she knew I had come. I\r\nsaw her endeavor to smile. Then her head slowly drooped and she had\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nAll the independent strength of my soul, all my intellectual or\r\nphilosophical resources—even my deep religious beliefs—were helpless to\r\ncomfort that great grief. For many days I was lost. From me had been\r\ntaken the one dear and truly near living being, the one soul closest\r\nand eternally adherent to my own responses.\r\n\r\nWords of condolence, letters from my friends, the attempt to comfort\r\nme by other members of the family, filled not one tiny corner of that\r\ngreat void, nor opened even one fraction of an inch of the closed door.\r\n\r\nMy mother had suffered for me—in so many ways. She had lived so many\r\nhours of anxiety for me because of my wandering and pugnacious life.\r\nShe had predicted my ascent. She had toiled and hoped too much and\r\ndied before she was yet forty-eight years old. She had, in her quiet\r\nmanner, done superhuman labors.\r\n\r\nShe might be alive now. She might have lived and enjoyed, with the\r\npower of her maternal instinct, my political success. It was not to be.\r\nBut to me it is a comfort to feel that she, even now, can see me and\r\nhelp me in my labors with her unequaled love.\r\n\r\nI, alone, returned to the regiment. I finished my last months of\r\nmilitary service. And then my life and my future were again distended\r\nwith uncertainty.\r\n\r\nI went to Opeglia as a teacher again, knowing all the time that\r\nteaching did not suit me. This time I was a master in a middle school.\r\nAfter a period, off I went with Cesare Battisti, then chief editor\r\nof the _Popolo_. Later he was destined to become one of the greatest\r\nof our national heroes—he who gave his life, he who was executed by\r\nthe enemy Austrians in the war, he who then was giving his thought\r\nand will to obtaining freedom of the province of Trento from the rule\r\nof Austria. His nobility and proud soul are always in my memory. His\r\naspirations as a socialist-patriot called to me.\r\n\r\nOne day I wrote an article maintaining that the Italian border was not\r\nat Ala, the little town which in those days stood on the old frontier\r\nbetween our kingdom and the old Austria. Whereupon I was expelled from\r\nAustria by the Imperial and Royal Government of Vienna.\r\n\r\nI was becoming used to expulsions. Once more a wanderer, I went back to\r\nForli.\r\n\r\nThe itch of journalism was in me. My opportunity was before me in the\r\neditorship of a local socialist newspaper. I understood now that\r\nthe Gordian knot of Italian political life could only be undone by an\r\nact of violence.\r\n\r\nTherefore I became the public crier of this basic, partisan, warlike\r\nconception. The time had come to shake the souls of men and fire their\r\nminds to thinking and acting. It was not long before I was proclaimed\r\nthe mouthpiece of the intransigent revolutionary socialist faction. I\r\nwas only twenty-nine years old when at Reggio Emilia at the Congress in\r\n1912, two years before the World War began, I was nominated as director\r\nof the _Avanti_. It was the only daily of the socialist cause and was\r\npublished in Milan.\r\n\r\nI lost my father just before I left for my new office. He was only\r\nfifty-seven. Nearly forty of those years had been spent in politics.\r\nHis was a rectangular mind, a wise spirit, a generous heart. He had\r\nlooked into the eyes of the first internationalist agitators and\r\nphilosophers. He had been in prison for his ideas.\r\n\r\nThe Romagna—that part of Italy from which we all came—a spirited\r\ndistrict with traditions of a struggle for freedom against foreign\r\noppressions—knew my father’s merit. He wrestled year in and year out\r\nwith endless difficulties and he had lost the small family patrimony\r\nby helping friends who had gone beyond their depth in the political\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nPrestige he had among all those who came into contact with him. The\r\nbest political men of his day liked him and respected him. He died\r\npoor. I believe his foremost desire was to live to see his sons\r\ncorrectly estimated by public opinion.\r\n\r\nAt the end he understood at last that the old eternal traditional\r\nforces such as capital could not be permanently overthrown by a\r\npolitical revolution. He turned his attention at the end toward\r\nbettering the souls of individuals. He wanted to make mankind true of\r\nheart and sensitive to fraternity. Many were the speeches and articles\r\nabout him after his death; three thousand of the men and women he had\r\nknown followed his body to the grave. My father’s death marked the end\r\nof family unity for us, the family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                           THE BOOK OF LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nI plunged forward into big politics when I settled in Milan at the head\r\nof the Avanti. My brother Arnaldo went on with his technical studies\r\nand my sister Edvige, having the offer of an excellent marriage,\r\nwent to live with her husband in a little place in Romagna called\r\nPremilcuore. Each one of us took up for himself the torn threads of\r\nthe family. We were separated, but in touch. We did not reunite again,\r\nhowever, until August 1914, when we met to discuss politics and war.\r\nWar had come—war—that female of dreads and fascinations.\r\n\r\nUp till then I had worked hard to build up the circulation, the\r\ninfluence and the prestige of the Avanti. After some months the\r\ncirculation had increased to more than one hundred thousand.\r\n\r\nI then had a dominant situation in the party. But I can say that I did\r\nnot yield an inch to demagoguery. I have never flattered the crowd, nor\r\nwheedled any one; I spoke always of the costs of victories—sacrifice\r\nand sweat and blood.\r\n\r\nI was living most modestly with my family, with my wife Rachele, wise\r\nand excellent woman who has followed me with patience and devotion\r\nacross all the wide vicissitudes of my life. My daughter Edda was\r\nthen the joy of our home. We had nothing to want. I saw myself in the\r\nmidst of fierce struggle, but my family did represent and always has\r\nrepresented to me an oasis of security and refreshing calm.\r\n\r\nThose years before the World War were filled by political twists and\r\nturns. Italian life was not easy. Difficulties were many for the\r\npeople. The conquest of Tripolitania had exacted its toll of lives and\r\nmoney in a measure far beyond our expectation. Our lack of political\r\nunderstanding brought at least one riot a week. During one ministry of\r\nGiolitti I remember thirty-three. They had their harvest of killed and\r\nwounded and of corroding bitterness of heart. Riots and upheavals among\r\nday laborers, among the peasants in the valley of the Po, riots in the\r\nsouth—even separatist movements in our islands. And in the meantime,\r\nabove all this atrophy of normal life, there went on the tournament and\r\njoust of political parties struggling for power.\r\n\r\nI thought then, as I think now, that only the common denominator of a\r\ngreat sacrifice of blood could have restored to all the Italian nation\r\nan equalization of rights and duties. The attempt at revolution—the Red\r\nWeek—was not revolution as much as it was chaos. No leaders! No means\r\nto go on! The middle class and the bourgeoisie gave us another picture\r\nof their insipid spirit.\r\n\r\nWe were in June then, picking over our own affairs with a microscope.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the murder of Serajevo came from the blue.\r\n\r\nIn July—the war.\r\n\r\nUp till that event my progress had been somewhat diverse, my growth of\r\ncapacity somewhat varied. In looking back one has to weigh the effect\r\nupon one of various influences commonly supposed powerful.\r\n\r\nIt is a general conviction that good or bad friends can decisively\r\nalter the course of a personality. Perhaps it may be true for those\r\nfundamentally weak in spirit whose rudders are always in the hands of\r\nother steersmen. During my life, I believe, neither my school friends,\r\nmy war friends, nor my political friends ever had the slightest\r\ninfluence upon me. I have listened always with intense interest to\r\ntheir words, their suggestions and sometimes to their advice, but I am\r\nsure that whenever I took an extreme decision I have obeyed only the\r\nfirm commandment of will and conscience which came from within.\r\n\r\nI do not believe in the supposed influence of books. I do not believe\r\nin the influence which comes from perusing the books about the lives\r\nand characters of men.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I have used only one big book.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I have had only one great teacher.\r\n\r\nThe book is life—lived.\r\n\r\nThe teacher is day-by-day experience.\r\n\r\nThe reality of experience is far more eloquent than all the theories\r\nand philosophies on all the tongues and on all the shelves.\r\n\r\nI have never, with closed eyes, accepted the thoughts of others when\r\nthey were estimating events and realities either in the normal course\r\nof things or when the situation appeared exceptional. I have\r\nsearched, to be sure, with a spirit of analysis the whole ancient and\r\nmodern history of my country. I have drawn parallels because I wanted\r\nto explore to the depths on the basis of historical fact the profound\r\nsources of our national life and of our character, and to compare our\r\ncapacities with those of other people.\r\n\r\nFor my supreme aim I have had the public interest. If I spoke of life\r\nI did not speak of a concept of my own life, my family life or that of\r\nmy friends. I spoke and thought and conceived of the whole Italian life\r\ntaken as a synthesis—as an expression of a whole people.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to be misunderstood, for I give a definite value to\r\nfriendship, but it is more for sentimental reasons than for any logical\r\nnecessity either in the realm of politics or that of reasoning and\r\nlogic. I, perhaps more than most men, remember my school friends. I\r\nhave followed their various careers. I keep in my memory all my war\r\nfriends, and teachers and superiors and assistants. It makes little\r\ndifference whether these friendships were with commanding officers or\r\nwith typical workers of our soil.\r\n\r\nOn my soldier friends the life of trench warfare—hard and\r\nfascinating—has left, as it has upon me, a profound effect. Great\r\nfriendships are not perfected on school benches, nor in political\r\nassemblies. Only in front of the magnitude and the suggestiveness of\r\ndanger, only after having lived together in the anxieties and torments\r\nof war, can one weigh the soundness of a friendship or measure in\r\nadvance how long it is destined to go on.\r\n\r\nIn politics, Italian life has had a rather short panorama of men.\r\nAll know one another. I have not forgotten those who in other days were\r\nmy companions in the socialistic struggle. Their friendship remains,\r\nprovided they on their part acknowledge the need to make amends for\r\nmany errors, and provided they have been able to understand that my\r\npolitical evolution has been the product of a constant expansion, of\r\na flow from springs always nearer to the realities of living life and\r\nalways further away from the rigid structures of sociological theorists.\r\n\r\nMy Fascist friends live always in my thoughts. I believe the younger\r\nones have a special place there. The organization of Fascism was marked\r\nand stamped with youth. It has youth’s spirit and it gathered youth,\r\nwhich, like a young orchard, has many years of productiveness for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThough it appears that the obligations of governing increase around\r\nme every day, I never forget those who were with me—the generous and\r\nwise builders, the unselfish and faithful collaborators, the devoted\r\nsoldiers of a new Fascist Italy. I follow step by step their personal\r\nand public fortunes.\r\n\r\nSome minds appear curious as to what territories my reading has\r\nexplored. I have never attached my name or my mind to a certain school,\r\nand as I have already said, I never believed that books were absolute\r\nand sure viaticums of life.\r\n\r\nI have read the Italian authors, old and new—thinkers, politicians,\r\nartists. I have always been attracted by the study of our\r\nRenaissance in all its aspects. The nineteenth century, with its\r\nartistic and spiritual contrasts, classicism and romanticism and their\r\ncontrasts, has held my attention. I have studied thoroughly the period\r\nof our history called _risorgimento_ in its moral and political essence.\r\n\r\nI have analyzed with great care all the development of our intellectual\r\nlife from 1870 up to this moment.\r\n\r\nThese studies have occupied the most serene hours of my day.\r\n\r\nAmong foreign writers, I have meditated much upon the work of the\r\nGerman thinkers. I have admired the French. One of the books that\r\ninterested me most was the “Psychology of the Crowd” by Gustave Lebon.\r\nThe intellectual life of the Anglo-Saxons interests me especially\r\nbecause of the organized character of its culture and its scholastic\r\ntaste and flavor.\r\n\r\nBut all that I have read and am reading is only a picture that is\r\nunfolded before my eyes without giving me an impression strong enough\r\nto make an incision in me. I draw out only the cardinal points that\r\ngive me above all and first of all the necessary elements for the\r\ncomparison of the essence of the different nations.\r\n\r\nI am desperately Italian. I believe in the function of Latinity.\r\n\r\nI came to these conclusions after and through a critical study of\r\nthe German, Anglo-Saxon and Slavonic history and that of the world;\r\nnor have I for obvious reasons neglected the history of the other\r\ncontinents.\r\n\r\nThe American people, by their sure and active creative lines of\r\nlife, have touched, and touch, my sensibility. For I am a man of\r\ngovernment and of party. I endlessly admire those who make out of\r\ncreative work a law of life, those who win with the ability of their\r\ngenius and not with the intrigue of their eloquence. I am for those who\r\nseek to make technic perfect in order to dominate the elements and give\r\nto men more sure footings for the future.\r\n\r\nI do not respect—I even hate—those men that leech a tenth of the riches\r\nproduced by others.\r\n\r\nThe American nation is a creative nation, sane, with straight-lined\r\nideas. When I talk with men of the United States it does not occur to\r\nme to use diplomacy for winning or persuading them. The American spirit\r\nis crystalline. One has to know how to take it and possibly win it over\r\nwith a watchful responsiveness rather than with cunning words. As the\r\nreserves of wealth are gone now from the continents to North America,\r\nit is right that a large part of the attention of the world should be\r\nconcentrated upon the activity of this nation that has men of great\r\nvalue, economists of real wisdom and scholars that are outlining the\r\nbasis of a new science and a new culture. I admire the discipline of\r\nthe American people and their sense of organization. Certainly every\r\nnation has its periods. The United States is now in the golden age. It\r\nis necessary to study these tendencies and their results, and this is\r\nnot only in the interest of America but in the interest of the world.\r\n\r\nAmerica, a land harboring so many of our emigrants, still calls to the\r\nspirit of new youth.\r\n\r\nI look to her youth for her destinies and the preservation of her\r\ngrowing ideals, just as I look to the youth of Italy for the progress\r\nof the Fascist state. It is not easy to remember always the importance\r\nof youth. It is not easy to retain the spirit of youth.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for me that in the trenches of the Carso—one of the\r\nbloodiest and most terrible spots of all the Allied battle fronts and\r\nin the vicissitudes of difficult experiences in the struggle with life,\r\nI did not leave my own youth behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                     WAR AND ITS EFFECT UPON A MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nI write of war and my experience in and with war. I write of popular\r\nmisconceptions as to war. I write of my convictions as to war. And I\r\nwrite of war from two points of view—the politics of the world and the\r\nreality of the trenches, where I have been and have learned the torture\r\nof pain.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me to show my development and feelings from war\r\nwithout showing how my nation entered war, felt war and accepted war.\r\nMy psychology was the Italian psychology. I lived it and I cannot\r\nsuppress it.\r\n\r\nIt was nonsense to believe that war came unheralded and as a new\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThe European war, which suddenly burst out in 1914 during a period of\r\napparent economic and moral peacefulness, was not a sudden return to\r\nbarbarism, as many optimistic socialists and believers in democracy\r\nwished—and still to this day wish—people to believe. One must not\r\nforget that in 1904 and 1905 Russia fought with Japan a long,\r\ndisastrous and exhausting war. In 1911 there was the Libyan war. In\r\n1912 and 1913 two Balkan Wars had kept the awakened attention of\r\nEurope on the destinies of these nations. These wars had in them\r\nthe characteristics of an extraordinary drama, as in the incident of\r\nLule-Burgas and in the siege of Adrianople.\r\n\r\nThe real truth of the matter was that an intense spirit of war was\r\nall over Europe—in the air—and everybody breathed it. It was the\r\nimponderable; we were at the dawn of a new tragic period of the history\r\nof mankind. The beginning of that hard historic event, the World War,\r\nwas at hand. The gigantic development drew in peoples and continents.\r\nIt compelled tens of millions of men to live in the trenches, to\r\nfight inch by inch for years over the bloody theatre of tragic\r\nconflict. Millions of dead and wounded, victories and defeats, complex\r\ninterests—moral or immoral—spirit of resentment and hate, bonds of\r\nfriendship and disillusionments—all that chaotic and passionate world\r\nwhich lived and made the Great War was part of a cyclopic ensemble\r\nwhich is difficult to grasp, to define, to circumscribe in mere\r\nautobiographic memoirs like these.\r\n\r\nWhen one thinks that Germany alone has already published on the war\r\nsixty official books, and considers many that the other nations have\r\npublished or will publish, one may lose himself in the labyrinth of\r\nspeculative thoughts. This tremendous chaos gave birth among the\r\ndefeated nations to the dissolving intellectual scepticism from which\r\nsprang the philosophy of realities.\r\n\r\nTherefore I proceed by impression, by remembrances. I force my memory\r\nto build up, in a logical line running parallel to my thoughts and\r\nactions, the rich picture and the innumerable interlocking events which\r\ntook place in the most tortured period that humanity ever knew. I\r\nwas intimately entwined with it.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy of Serajevo, the murder of the Archduke Francis Ferdinand,\r\nheir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, and his wife, created a panic\r\nin the public opinion of the whole of Europe. Remember that I was then\r\neditor of an internationalist-socialist daily. That which wounded the\r\nsensitiveness of the various nations was the lightning rapidity of the\r\ntragedy. I could see the mathematical efficiency of the organizations\r\nwhich made possible the plans and success of the murder in spite of all\r\nthe exceptional precautions taken by the police of Austria-Hungary.\r\nI realized that Europe was in sympathy with the restlessness of\r\nSerbia against the old Hapsburg monarchy. After the annexation of\r\nBosnia-Herzegovina by Austria, that region never had a minute’s peace.\r\nThe Serbian mentality, which worked—and still does—itself along the\r\nsubterranean tunnels of secret societies, gave from time to time\r\nunpleasant surprises to Austria-Hungary, and the large empire was\r\nsuffering from it. But no more than a thoroughbred is disturbed by\r\nflies.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy of Serajevo, however, appeared to me to be the last straw.\r\nEvery one understood that Austria would act. Strong measures! All the\r\nembassies, all the different political parties of Europe, realized the\r\ngravity of the case and its terrible consequences. They went feverishly\r\nto work to find a possible solution. And we looked on!\r\n\r\nIn Italy the echo of the murder of Serajevo aroused only curiosity\r\nand a thirst for more news. Even when the corpses of the archduke and\r\nhis wife were taken into the Gulf of Triest, which was lighted up the\r\nwhole night with tremendous torches, the impression on Italians, even\r\nthose still under Austrian rule, was no deeper than it would have been\r\nin the presence of a spectacular epilogue of a theatrical tragedy.\r\n\r\nFrancis Ferdinand was an enemy of Italy. I thought that he always\r\nunderestimated our race. He was not able to sense the heart throbs of\r\nthe people of Italian blood still under his flag. He could not weigh\r\nthe power of race consciousness. He was cherishing the dream of a\r\nmonarchy melting three races together. Races, I knew, are difficult to\r\nmelt. Francis Ferdinand enjoyed the display of his antipathy toward\r\nItaly. He took interest in the affairs of Italy only to seek a possible\r\nsolution for the question of the temporal power of the Pope. It was\r\nsaid that in the secrecy of his court and among his religious advisers\r\nhe contemplated the creation of a papal city in Rome with an outlet on\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nThough deeply a Catholic, like myself, he accepted of Christianity\r\nonly the hard, familiar, autocratic ideals which were the base of the\r\nold despotism forming the platform of autocratic government, but were\r\nincapable of speaking to souls. In psychological makeup, this small,\r\nsnarling archduke believed himself to be specially anointed by God\r\nto rule over subjects. He put fear in the hearts of smaller nations\r\nbordering his domain. His death gave surprise; it gave no sadness to\r\nus. For obvious reasons the pathetic end of the archduchess created\r\nfeelings of a more sympathetic nature. We Italians are responsive,\r\nsympathetic.\r\n\r\nThe telegram of the Kaiser to the bereaved children fed the already\r\ndramatic tune and tempo of our impressions. I saw that Germany intended\r\nsteadfastly to stand back of Austria for whatever action this nation\r\nwas going to take toward Serbia. It was thought that Vienna would make\r\na formal protest to Belgrade, but no one anticipated an ultimatum of\r\nsuch deadliness as fatally to wound the sensibility and the honor, as\r\nwell as the very freedom, of that nation. All these currents I had to\r\nwatch as the young editor of the _Avanti_.\r\n\r\nThe dictatorial form of the ultimatum, the style in which it was\r\nwritten, brought home to the world the shocking realization that war\r\nhung in the sky. We, in Italy, had to ask whether internationalism was\r\nhaving a success or whether it was an unreality. I wondered and reached\r\na conclusion.\r\n\r\nEmbassies went feverishly to work; the political parties added the\r\npressure of their weight to the diplomatic activities. The call to arms\r\nand the clamor of gathering armies put into second line the theoretical\r\nprotests of socialist and international forces.\r\n\r\nAll of us in Italy who faced hard facts rather than mouthy theories\r\nheard the call of our country—a call of loneliness. Illusions burst\r\nlike bubbles. Even the convention of French and German Socialists and\r\nthe murder of Jaurès in Paris were but secondary episodes. To me they\r\nappeared as fringes of the mighty and dramatic conflict toward which\r\nday by day the various nations were being drawn by destiny.\r\n\r\nI must not forget that a few months previous to the Great War I\r\nhad heard and noted a voice raised in the French parliament painting\r\nwith pessimistic colors the inefficiency of the French Army, both\r\nfrom the view-point of economic war and the lack of modern means of\r\ndefense and offense. Clemenceau, foaming at the mouth, was present\r\nat this discussion. He said afterward that never in his career as a\r\npolitician since 1871 had he witnessed a more dramatic séance than\r\nthis one in which the French nation was compelled fully to realize the\r\ninsufficiency of its army, lacking the very means needed for a great\r\nconflict. That was a lesson. We do not forget it.\r\n\r\nWar was ripe. The tardy and weak intervention, both known and secret,\r\nof the Pope and of the benevolent nations outside the circle of the\r\nAllies had no weight. They could not stop the procession of events. War\r\nbegan the first of August, 1914. It was the full bloom of summer. Under\r\nthe deep shadow of the cloud the people of old Europe stood in awe, but\r\nfascinated as one is fascinated by a snake.\r\n\r\nItaly a few years previously had renewed the Triple Alliance Treaty.\r\nIt had been a marriage without respect and without trust, brought\r\nabout more in order to counterbalance military power than by political\r\nnecessity. There is small difference between security and military\r\nalliance.\r\n\r\nThe alliance with Austria and Germany gave, however, to Italy a certain\r\nlatitude and a certain freedom of movement. The Marchese of San\r\nGiuliano, who was at the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\r\nfaced by the Austrian ultimatum to Serbia and by the scheming to bring\r\nabout war at all costs, had to play fast to keep Italy neutral. As a\r\nmatter of fact, the treaty called only for action if one or more of the\r\nnations of the Triple Alliance was assaulted by a nation outside that\r\nalliance. We were kept in the dark, as I well knew. That was enough to\r\nbreak the pact—to free us from further obligations to that alliance.\r\n\r\nOne of the first courageous actions in which Italy showed the measure\r\nof her independence and strength was recognition of this. Meanwhile the\r\nintervention of Russia in behalf of Serbia called also France against\r\nGermany, the ally of Austria-Hungary.\r\n\r\nI watched England. She was pondering deeply upon the step to take; and\r\nthen, in order to keep her supremacy, and also for the sake of her\r\npride and the sake of humanity, she moved her formidable war machinery\r\nand quickened the organization of new armies to snatch from Germany’s\r\ngrip the control of the old Continent.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion in Italy was deeply moved, facing war, with its German\r\ninvasion of East France. There was the description, with horrid\r\ndetails, of German methods, and above all the invasion of Belgium\r\nin spite of every sense of right and humanity. The French Army was\r\nhelplessly forced back. The future, not of one nation but of many\r\nnations, was in the scale. Of this, in my editorial office, I was\r\nalways conscious. There was also the feeling of a common culture which\r\nwas compelling us to forget past and present quarrels. I could not\r\nbear the idea that my country might abandon those who were crushed\r\nunder the weight of war and unwarranted misfortune.\r\n\r\nGermany began to influence Italian public opinion with methods of\r\npropaganda that irritated the sensitiveness of our race. That enraged\r\nme. To direct this propaganda, a great diplomat, Prince von Bülow, who\r\nknew the Italian and Roman world intimately, was sent. His aim in Italy\r\nwas to ensure its neutrality for good and all.\r\n\r\nBut our nation was turning toward war. I was helping. The Socialist\r\nparty, which at that time had a certain weight in Italian life, due\r\nmore to weakness of other political parties than to its own strength,\r\nwas uncertain what attitude to take. There it wabbled. The majority in\r\nthat party stood for an absolute neutrality—a neutrality without limit\r\nof time, pledge or dignity. In that party there were many who stood\r\nopenly in sympathy with Germany. I did not. A handful of intelligent\r\nand strong-willed men began to ask themselves if it was really right\r\nfor Italians to lend themselves to the political aims of the King of\r\nPrussia, and if that was good for the future of Italy and of the world.\r\nI, myself, asked that question in the newspaper _Avanti_. For obvious\r\nreasons it was read avidly by every class of citizens. The putting of\r\nthat question was my most distinguished effort at journalism.\r\n\r\nIt was sufficient to cause a part of public opinion to turn toward the\r\npossibility of our standing side by side with France and England in\r\nthe war. We could not, and should not, forget that there were certain\r\nsentimental reasons, besides the practical reasons, advising us to\r\nreview in this general conflict the old decision concerning our eastern\r\nborder, which had remained open since our war with Austria in 1886.\r\n\r\nAt night I walked to my family, to my home, with pregnant questions\r\nin my mind, with deepening determination, with hardening resolution.\r\nAbove all, there was my own country. I saw that internationalism was\r\ncrumbling. The unit of loyalty was too large. I wrote an editorial\r\nin which I said also how utterly foolish was the idea that even if a\r\nsocialist state were created, the old barriers of race and historical\r\ncontentions would not go on causing wars.\r\n\r\nItaly’s borders on the eastern side reached the Judrio, but the region\r\nof Trentino illegally held by Austria entered as a wedge between\r\nLombardy and the Venetian provinces. Our deal with the empire of\r\nAustria-Hungary was still to be closed, because the borders prophesied\r\nby Dante were dear to every Italian heart. They were still and always\r\nwould be along the line of the Brenner and of the Giulian and Illyrian\r\nAlps, including Fiume and Dalmatia.\r\n\r\nFacing this new situation, every political man, including myself,\r\nbegan to examine his conscience. The mere mention of this problem was\r\nsufficient to make clear and evident the hidden travail of national\r\nconsciousness. I was transformed in my thought.\r\n\r\n“Now or never!” was the war cry of Cesare Battisti, whose noble spirit\r\nand final martyrdom by Austrian execution has made him immortal in\r\nItalian hearts. Then there was the prophetic vision of that fiery\r\nrevolutionary spirit, Filippo Corridoni. With their inspiration I\r\nbegan to drag with me a fraction of the Socialists in favor of war.\r\nI had with me rebels of many schools, who through the dregs of their\r\nstruggles would in the end now stand once more upon the indestructible\r\nvitality of our race.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Senedrium, seeing where I was going, took the _Avanti_\r\nout of my control. I could no longer preach, by that means,\r\nintervention of Italy in the war. I faced the Socialists in our\r\nconventions. I was expelled. I held public gatherings.\r\n\r\nI created the Fasciti—a group of daring youths who believed that\r\nintervention could be forced. Do not doubt that their actions shook\r\ndeeply our political framework, existing from the time of the\r\nindependence of Italy up till 1914. I was their leader.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to-day when democracy is challenged to recall that\r\nthe Liberal Democratic pacifist group, headed by Giovanni Giolitti, a\r\nman of great influence in parliament and also a shrewd organizer of\r\npolitical schemes, was busy in the attempt to find a formula which\r\nwould solve the problem of righting the borders of Italy, but which\r\nwould save our country from the burden, the sacrifice and the loss of\r\nlife that every war imposes. Giolitti promised that, even without war,\r\nItaly could obtain a great deal. This “great deal” awakened a feeling\r\nof sarcasm in the generous hearts of Italians. Naturally they are\r\nrealists and the enemies of all forms of political bargaining.\r\n\r\nItalians were looking beyond those peaceful concessions and those\r\npetty betterings of the borders. They did not believe in the sincerity\r\nof this scheming. I considered it weak statesmanship—the statesmanship\r\nof compromise. There were seers who saw in the European conflict not\r\nonly national advantages but the possibility of a supremacy of race. In\r\nthe cycle of time, again a dramatic period had come which was making it\r\npossible for Italy by the weight of its army to deal as an equal with\r\nthe leading nations of the world.\r\n\r\nThat was our chance. I wanted to seize it. It became my one thought of\r\nintensity.\r\n\r\nThe World War began on July 28, 1914. Within sixty days I severed my\r\nofficial connection with the Socialist party. I had already ceased to\r\nbe editor of the _Avanti_.\r\n\r\nI felt lighter, fresher. I was free! I was better prepared to fight\r\nmy battles than when I was bound by the dogmas of any political\r\norganization. But I understood that I could not use with efficient\r\nstrength my convictions if I was without that modern weapon, capable\r\nof all possibilities, ready to arm and to help, good for offense and\r\ndefense—the newspaper.\r\n\r\nI needed a daily paper. I hungered for one. I gathered together a few\r\nof my political friends who had followed me in the last hard struggle\r\nand we held a war council. When money alone is concerned, I am anything\r\nbut a wizard. When it is a question of means or of capital to start a\r\nproject, or how to finance a newspaper, I grasp only the abstract side,\r\nthe political value, the spiritual essence of the thing. To me, money\r\nis detestable; what it may do is sometimes beautiful and sometimes\r\nnoble.\r\n\r\nA few friends, bristling with ideas and ardent with faith, almost\r\nimmediately found small rooms, garret-like, in the narrow street of\r\nPaolo da Cannobio, near the Piazza del Duomo in Milan. Near by there\r\nwas a printing establishment. Its owner agreed to publish our newspaper\r\nat a small cost. I was mad to tell Italy and Italians the truth—their\r\nopportunity!\r\n\r\nWe had no need for great means. We wanted a newspaper that would hold\r\nthe city of Milan like a fortress, with editorial articles of such\r\nvalue that they would be reprinted or quoted by every Italian newspaper.\r\n\r\nThus—and how dramatically!—the number of our readers would be\r\nmultiplied. That was my passion. Our offices were quickly furnished\r\nwith a desk and a few chairs. I can never cease to have affection for\r\nthat intellectual dugout, the journalistic trenches from which I began\r\nto fight. A contract was signed with the printing establishment—a\r\ncontract that every week was in danger of smashing for the lack of the\r\nfew thousand lire needed to pay our weekly expense. But we were living\r\non an idea.\r\n\r\nOn November 15, 1914, the first number of the _Popolo d’Italia_\r\nappeared. Even now I call this new paper my most cherished child. It\r\nwas only through it, small as was its beginning, that I was able to win\r\nall the battles of my political life. I am still its director.\r\n\r\nI could write and I may write a thousand memories of this newspaper\r\nwhich was born in 1914 and remained my platform up to 1922. It was\r\nan instrument for the making of me. The name of the _Popolo d’Italia_\r\nwill occur over and over again. Its story in any case may be told\r\nthrough my personality as a political man, as a newspaper man, as a\r\nbeliever in this war, as a soldier, as an Italian and as a Fascist.\r\n\r\nMy first article in the _Popolo d’Italia_ turned a large part of public\r\nopinion toward the intervention of Italy in the war, side by side with\r\nFrance and England.\r\n\r\nStanding by me and helping my work as newspaper man were the\r\nFascisti. They were composed of revolutionary spirits who believed in\r\nintervention. They were youths—the students of the universities, the\r\nsocialist syndicalists—destroying faith in Karl Marx by their ideals.\r\nThere were professional men too—and the workingmen who could still hear\r\nthe real voice of the country.\r\n\r\nAnd now, while Italy remained out of the war, our first legions of\r\nvolunteers were organized and went to France to fight. In the Argonne\r\nfell the two sons of Ricciotti Garibaldi, Bruno and Costante, nephews\r\nof the great Garibaldi, who conquered North Sicily and Naples for\r\nUnited Italy. The funeral of the two heroes took place in Rome and had\r\nsolemn echoes all over Italy. Again the red shirts, once distinguished\r\nas the saviors of Italy, now in the land of France, testified to the\r\nindestructibility of Latinity.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  The first offices, in Milan, of the _Popolo d’Italia_, Mussolini’s\r\n  paper.\r\n  ]\r\n\r\nThe past quarrels—not long past—of Mediterranean interests were wiped\r\nout. The hostilities of the French during the time of our war in Libya\r\nwere put aside. No one remembered the episode of the French ships\r\n_Manouba_ and _Carthage_, which brought help to the Turks, who\r\nwere fighting against us, in January, 1912. Everything was off. France\r\nwas in danger, assaulted and invaded after the tragic rape of Belgium.\r\nThis I preached and set forth. France was in danger!\r\n\r\nGabriele d’Annunzio, on the fifth of May, made his speech at Quarto dei\r\nMille, near Genoa. Quarto dei Mille was the starting point of Garibaldi\r\nand his thousand northerners and other patriots who went down to Sicily\r\nto deliver Southern Italy from the yoke of the Bourbons. He, with\r\nsuperb eloquence, exhorted Italy to enter the war.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the country was tuned up. The opposition of Giolitti\r\nbrought about a quick decision. The crown, bound by parliamentary\r\nformulas and by the advice of its counsellors, wanting to follow\r\nstrictly the literal and orthodox interpretation of the constitution,\r\ntold the personal representative of the Kaiser that Italy as an old\r\nally had been kept in the dark and thus betrayed.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection in Milan in favor of war, the strong feelings of the\r\nsame flavor in Rome, Padua, Genoa and Naples, decided His Majesty\r\nVictor Emmanuel III to exclude Giovanni Giolitti and to reconfide to\r\nSalandra, who had tendered his resignation, the task of reconstituting\r\na new ministry. I felt that I had had a part in winning this battle.\r\nStill a young unproved man, I had already a record of untrammeled\r\nfreedom and power.\r\n\r\nThe new ministry spelled war. Thrown aside was the “great deal” of His\r\nExcellency Giolitti; the question now was to choose the right moment\r\nand the right way to jump into the war. We were breathing hard, our\r\nhearts were ready, we were awaiting the great hour. It came May 24,\r\n1915. Can any one say what were my emotions at this moment of triumph?\r\n\r\nI cannot try to narrate in one chapter all the events of the war on\r\nthe Italian front. It is impossible. The war moulded me. I was forced\r\ninto its dramatic unfolding in the circumscribed view-point of a mere\r\nsoldier of the war. I will tell what touched me most as a soldier and\r\nindirectly as a political man.\r\n\r\nI made up my mind to be the best soldier possible from the very day\r\nthat I wore again the glorious uniform of gray-green of the regiment\r\nof Bersaglieri—the best shock troops of Italy—in which regiment I had\r\nalready served during the time of my compulsory military service. I\r\nwanted to be a soldier, obedient, faithful to discipline, stretching\r\nmyself with all my might to the fulfilment of my duty.\r\n\r\nIn this I felt that I succeeded. My political position brought me\r\nplenty of offers of privileges and sheltered places. I turned them down.\r\n\r\nI wanted to create the impression of a complete and rigid consistence\r\nwith an ideal. This was not a scheming on my part for personal gain;\r\nit was a deep need in my nature of what I believed and still hold\r\non to as my life’s dedication—namely, that once a man sets up to\r\nbe the expounder of an idea or of a new school of thought, he must\r\nconsistently and intensively live the daily life and fight battles for\r\nthe doctrines that he teaches at any cost until victory—to the end!\r\n\r\nTime has effaced many things; the easy spirit of forgetfulness has\r\nerased so much. Victory, which came after forty-one months of hard\r\nfighting, has awakened many deep resentments.\r\n\r\nAs soon as war was declared, as I have said, I asked the military\r\nauthorities to accept my services as a volunteer. They answered\r\nthat I could not be a volunteer. That was a tragedy. They said that\r\nthey refused on the ground that an article of the military by-laws\r\nconsidered as possible volunteers only those who had been rejected\r\nfor physical unfitness, or were exonerated for other reasons from\r\ncompulsory military service. I could not be accepted as a volunteer.\r\nI was to wait my turn to be called to arms until the order from my\r\nsuperiors should be sent me. I was disconsolate.\r\n\r\nHappily, my turn came quickly. On September first, only three months\r\nafter Italy declared war, I donned the simple uniform of a private\r\nBersagliere. I was sent to Brescia, in Lombardy, not far from the raids\r\nof airplanes, to drill.\r\n\r\nAlmost at once I was, to my great relief, despatched to the thick of\r\nthe fighting on the high Alps. For a few months I underwent the hardest\r\ntrials of my life in mountain trenches. We still had nothing to soften\r\nour hardships in the trenches or in the barracks. We were simply\r\nstumbling along. Short of everything—carrying on—muddling through!\r\nWhat we suffered the first months—cold, rain, mud, hunger! They did\r\nnot succeed in dampening in the slightest degree my enthusiasm and my\r\nconviction as to the necessity and the inevitableness of war. They\r\ndid not change the direction of one hair of my head, one thought in it.\r\n\r\nI was chosen to be the amanuensis of headquarters. That I refused. I\r\nrefused flatly. I amused myself instead by joining the most dangerous\r\nreconnoitering expeditions. It was my will and my wish. I gained\r\nthrough that. Within a few months I was promoted corporal by merit of\r\nwar action, with a citation from my superior in these words: “Benito\r\nMussolini, ever the first in operations of courage and audacity;”\r\n\r\nMy political past, with the suspicions of cautious and sometimes\r\nunseeing authorities, still followed me; it was enough to keep my\r\nsuperiors from sending me to the training school for officers at\r\nVernezzo. After one week of leave I went back to the trenches,\r\nwhere I remained for months. The same life, feverish, adventurous,\r\ndesperate—and then typhoid fever sent me to the military hospital at\r\nCividale. When I was better I was packed off to Ferrara for a brief,\r\nstupid period of convalescence. From there I again took my place on the\r\nhigh pinnacles of the Alps where at night one looking into the dark sky\r\nwith its shimmering stars felt nearer to the great dome above.\r\n\r\nMy battalion was ordered to an advance post on the Carso—Section 144—to\r\ntake up the offensive. I was then made one of the company of soldiers\r\nwho had specialized in hand grenades. We lived only a few dozen yards\r\nfrom the enemy, in a perpetual and, it sometimes seemed, an eternal\r\natmosphere of shell fire and mortal danger that would be our life\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nAfter the first period of hardship I became perfectly and almost\r\ncomfortably accustomed to all the terrible elements that life in\r\nthe trenches involves. I read with hungry eagerness the _Popolo\r\nd’Italia_—my newspaper. I had left it in the hands of a few friends.\r\nPrecipitously separated from it, as one leaves suddenly a beloved\r\nrelative, I had given orders to keep alight the lamp of Italy’s duty\r\nand destiny.\r\n\r\nI commanded: “Continue always to call for war to the end.”\r\n\r\nI wrote often to my friends. Never did I let myself indulge in\r\nwriting all my true feelings and opinions, because I was first of all\r\na soldier, obeying. I found my recreation in the trenches studying\r\nthe psychology of officers and troops. Later on that practice in\r\nobservation became invaluable to me.\r\n\r\nIn my rough heart I held a persistent admiration for the soldiers\r\nfrom all corners of Italy. Many ordered to the eastern front were not\r\nconvinced of the historical basis for the war; yet they knew how to\r\nobey their commanding officers with admirable discipline. Many of those\r\nofficers were students of the colleges and universities. It was fine\r\nto see them striving to emulate the regulars and to prove that the\r\nold-time valor was still alive in the new Italian generation.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that war, with its heavy toll of man and materials, and\r\nwith its terrific hardships, surprised us. It was far away from our\r\nGaribaldian conception of what war was. We were compelled, in breakneck\r\nhaste, to modify our ideas, to change our systems of fighting and\r\nour methods of offense and defense. My heart was gladdened to see that\r\nthe capacity for adaptability of our race brought marvellous and quick\r\nreturns. The headquarters and all the auxiliary military organizations,\r\nparticularly the medical, worked with a precision which I never have\r\nforgotten. But often, as I went over the political situation back of\r\nour armies, dark doubts were in my mind. The work and actions of the\r\nmen in power and of the political organizations centred in Rome caused\r\nme deep fears. The parliamentary world seemed unable to free itself\r\nfrom its old faults.\r\n\r\nThe poisonous currents of non-intervention and neutrality were still\r\nspending their last strength upon us. They would not fairly face their\r\ndefeat. I knew they were doing their utmost to minimize the energy and\r\nelasticity of our fighting efforts.\r\n\r\nThe foolish babblings and fears of the coffeehouse strategists, the\r\nslackers whose presence offended the families whose sons were in the\r\nwar, contributed to depress the spirit of resistance. As a plain\r\nsoldier, I could not understand how, for instance, Rumania could be\r\ndragged into the war with a few hundred machine guns. How could Greece\r\nbe persuaded to march against the Turks, influenced by a classic dance\r\nthat Isadora Duncan performed at the Piræus?\r\n\r\nI was following, day by day, the movement of our army—the Battle of\r\nthe Isonzo in 1916, the fights on the Alps. With less interest, I\r\nfollowed the fortunes of war in France, the unfortunate failure at the\r\nDardanelles and the developments in the eastern section. As for\r\nItaly, never for a minute did I doubt that victory would finally come\r\nto us. Though war were to last longer than the longest estimate, though\r\nour economic power might totter under the effort and weight of the\r\nconflict, nevertheless I was sure of a final victory.\r\n\r\nThe Italian army in its various actions was led by a method of\r\nsuccessive assaults, to shake the efficiency of the enemy. In spite of\r\nall the hardship, discipline remained intact throughout our lines. The\r\ninvasion attempted on the plateaus of the Alps in 1916 was soon thrown\r\nback. The soldiers of the Carso, where I was, had all the appearance of\r\nseasoned veterans.\r\n\r\nIn such a gigantic drama, when thousands of our brothers fell, it is\r\nabsurd to speak of oneself.\r\n\r\nHowever, to prove once more what miseries were woven into the Italian\r\nlife of politics, I was compelled from time to time to give out in\r\nthe newspapers news concerning myself. This was in order to smash the\r\nsuspicions of those persons who thought me hidden in some office,\r\ndistributing mail and entertaining in my mind doubts of the possibility\r\nof our winning the war. I was compelled to offset this slander and\r\nto state over and over what I had done and what I was doing. I was\r\nthen major corporal of the Bersaglieri and had been in the front line\r\ntrenches from the beginning of the war up to February, 1917, always\r\nunder arms, always facing the enemy without my faith being shaken or\r\nmy convictions wavering an inch. From time to time I sent articles\r\nto the _Popolo d’Italia_ exhorting to endless resistance. I pleaded\r\nfor unshaken faith in final victory. For reasons of military\r\ndiscipline I used a _nom de plume_. Thus I found myself fighting in two\r\nways—against the enemy without and in front of me and against the enemy\r\nof weak spirit within and behind me.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of February 22, 1917, during a bombardment of the enemy\r\ntrenches in Sector 144—the sector of the hard-pressed Carso under the\r\nheaviest shellfire—there happened one of those incidents which was a\r\ndaily occurrence in trench life. One of our own grenades burst in our\r\ntrench among about twenty of us soldiers. We were covered with dirt\r\nand smoke, and torn by metal. Four died. Various others were fatally\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nI was rushed to the hospital of Ronchi, a few miles from the enemy\r\ntrenches. Doctor Piccagnoni and other surgeons took care of me with\r\nthe greatest zeal. My wounds were serious. The patience and ability of\r\nthe physicians succeeded in taking out of my body forty-four pieces of\r\nthe grenade. Flesh was torn, bones broken. I faced atrocious pain; my\r\nsuffering was indescribable. I underwent practically all my operations\r\nwithout the aid of an anæsthetic. I had twenty-seven operations in one\r\nmonth; all except two were without anæsthetics.\r\n\r\nThis infernal life of pain lasted until a furious bombardment burst\r\ninto pieces one wing and part of the central building of my hospital\r\nat Ronchi. All the wounded were rushed to a far-away refuge, but my\r\ncondition would not permit my removal. Unable to move, I remained for\r\ndays under the intermittent fire of the enemy guns among the dirty,\r\njagged ruins of the building. I was absolutely defenseless.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  _From a photograph by A. Badodi, Milan._\r\n  A photograph of Mussolini in the war, published in the _Popola\r\n  d’Italia_\r\n  Translation: The most recent snapshot of our editor and his captain\r\n  taken at a point of the extreme lines on the Carso.\r\n  ]\r\n\r\nIn spite of all, my wounds began to heal. Better days and relief\r\ncame. I received numberless telegrams of solicitude and once His\r\nMajesty the King called; his warm sense of humanity toward all soldiers\r\nand toward the victims of the war will never be forgotten by me or by\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nAfter some months I found myself in a war hospital in Milan. In August\r\nI began to walk with crutches, on which I swung about for many months.\r\nMy limbs were too weak to support my weight.\r\n\r\nI took my place as a fighter in my newspaper office. The acute\r\nsituation created by the incredible and inconceivable failure of the\r\nRussian front was putting upon us new duties. It was necessary to face\r\nthem. To all this there was added a subtle propaganda in the land. That\r\ndespicable poison had as a slogan the vile sentence of a Socialist\r\nmember of parliament: “We will desert the trenches before the winter\r\ncomes.”\r\n\r\nThere was need to fight to a finish these mysterious forces which were\r\nplaying upon the sentiments and sufferings of the people. Soldiers,\r\nafter a fortnight’s furlough, were returning to the trenches in a\r\nsullen frame of mind. Life in the cities had all the characteristics of\r\nrevelry. It was the psychological moment in which it was necessary to\r\nhave the people feel highly the strength of authority. It was necessary\r\nthat the government should stand up in its shoes.\r\n\r\nI do not choose to make posthumous recriminations. The weakness of\r\ninternal politics in 1917, the feeble parliamentary situation, the\r\nhateful socialistic propaganda, were certainly preparing the ground\r\nfor events that could prove to be ruinous. And the blow came in\r\nOctober, 1917; it took the name of Caporetto.\r\n\r\nNever in my life as an Italian and as a politician have I experienced\r\na sorrow equal to that which I suffered after news of the defeat of\r\nCaporetto.\r\n\r\nThis episode, compared with other defeats in the various theatres of\r\nthe Great War, certainly did not have an exceptional importance, but\r\nit was a terrific blow for Italians. This sudden breaking down of our\r\nfront let a wedge of the enemy army penetrate into the high valley of\r\nthe Isonzo. In the first rush of the war we had gone over the borders\r\ninto old Austria, carrying on our warfare on enemy ground. We had\r\nwithstood in 1916 the attack on the Alps of Asiago. We had conquered\r\nthe plateau of Bainsizza. We had been ten times victorious on the\r\nIsonzo. Our sensitiveness and tormented souls were now shaken to the\r\ndepths.\r\n\r\nThe moment was fearful. The Third Army, surrounded on the other side\r\nof the Isonzo, must be saved. It was imperative to stand at all costs\r\non the Piave and to resist like stone on Mount Grappa to save the\r\nnorth of the Venetian provinces from being cut off from the rest of\r\nItaly. The rally of the army, followed by quick action, took place in\r\nalmost no time. On Mount Grappa the Army of Iron withstood. On the\r\nPiave the enemy could not pass by. A new strength entered into play.\r\nOne could feel it coming. A new spirit of war took its unfaltering\r\nstand. Once more we saw the enemy face to face, after losing Gorizia\r\nand two provinces, Belluno and Udine. We were deeply wounded, and we\r\nlived dramatic moments which seared my heart. But we may now be\r\nsure that Italy did not go through the tragic hours that many armies\r\nand other countries underwent. Compare with our disaster the general\r\npicture of the Great War—the loss of three provinces with the Battle of\r\nthe Masurian Lakes, the invasion of Königsberg, the fourteen invaded\r\ndepartments of France and the flooding of Belgium.\r\n\r\nI am proud that during that year of desperate moments my paper gave\r\na higher note to the political life of the country. We raised the\r\nfighting spirit of the soldiers.\r\n\r\nHelped by the mutilated, the wounded and the pro-war veterans, I\r\nbegan an active campaign of “Stand to a Finish.” With fiery style I\r\ndemanded on the part of the central government severe action against\r\nslackers and whosoever undermined the spirit of war. I called for the\r\norganization of a volunteer army. I asked for military rule in the\r\nnorth of Italy. I insisted on the suppression of socialist newspapers.\r\nI asked for a more humane treatment of the soldiers. I campaigned for\r\nwar discipline—first behind us and all over the land, then at the\r\nfront. This campaign developed by degrees in the newspaper, then in\r\npublic meetings, in gatherings at the front. It brought results far\r\nbeyond my highest hopes. The government seemed to be tugged after us by\r\nour efforts, toward resistance and victory.\r\n\r\nThus the winter went by. With the coming of the spring the whole\r\nItalian people stretched out their energies toward the front on the\r\nPiave and that on the Grappa.\r\n\r\nAt last! A spirit of national solidarity, deep and alive, had\r\nbecome the common property both of the soldiers and of their families.\r\nA high spirit of duty and sacrifice was the rule of life in our Italy!\r\n\r\nWe were ready in 1918 on the Piave with a heroic army. The Arditi, the\r\nfirst shock troops, composed of volunteers who went over the top with\r\nhand grenades and daggers, was giving a unique dramatic appeal to our\r\naggressive spirit. In every one there was the deep desire to efface the\r\nmemory of the days of Caporetto. We were to go back—back to where our\r\nbrothers, dead and alive, were waiting for us! The remembrance of our\r\ndead, above all, was calling to us. Surely the wish of our adversaries\r\nto cross the Piave could never be; it was an idle hope, to be met and\r\ncrushed by our own offensive.\r\n\r\nAviation continued to give service of reconnoitering and bombardment. I\r\ncould feel the soul of Italy stretching toward victory. Necessity had\r\nsharpened the more brilliant minds. June came and with it the dawn of\r\nthe enemy’s attack.\r\n\r\nOur secret service succeeded in learning exactly the time that the\r\nenemy would start his drive. Following sound war strategy, our supreme\r\ncommand decided to surprise the enemy, and just a few hours before the\r\nenemy was ready to move a deluge of every description fell on his front\r\nlines as well as the supporting lines behind. His plans were smashed.\r\nHe threw bridges across the Piave, but every one was destroyed. The\r\nMontello, which was once the key of that front and which the enemy\r\nintended to take and use as a pincher against our army, we held\r\nwith dogged tenacity. There were oscillations for a few miles, but the\r\nbattle raged on without a stop. Our counter attacks came back always,\r\nagain and again and again. Thus after the first three days the enemy\r\nfelt that this time the Italians were like an unbreakable wall which\r\nthey could not scale or batter down!\r\n\r\nNear Zenzon the adversary succeeded in crossing the river as far\r\nas Monastie of Treviso, but a rapid counter attack of a few of our\r\nbrigades threw him back on the Piave again. It turned into a disaster\r\nfor the enemy, as the river, flooded, washed away bridges and soldiers\r\ntoward the sea. On the twenty-third of June, five days after the\r\nbeginning of the big battle, our supreme command assured Italy that\r\nour resistance was bound to hold. I felt that it was a sure sign that\r\nvictory was at hand. I believe to this day that the Battle of the Piave\r\nwas one of the most decisive of the whole World War.\r\n\r\nThe enemy suffered loss beyond reckoning. About 100,000 Hungarians\r\nwere sacrificed on the Piave. That brought about deep resentment in\r\nBudapest. Among the people of the various races in the Austrian Empire\r\nthere began discussions about the burdens that each nationality in that\r\nempire had to suffer. From them—the enemies—each nationality felt that\r\nits treatment was becoming intolerable.\r\n\r\nNews leaked out to us from Austria-Hungary. It was clear that internal\r\ndifficulties there were growing every moment. The enemy’s army,\r\nhowever, was still holding together and under the goad of necessity was\r\nsharpening the work of oppression on our two provinces which still\r\nremained under the weight of occupation and misfortune.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time, right after the spirit of exhilaration of victory,\r\nthat I observed strange tendencies in the Italian political world.\r\nEvil activity was at hand. It needed to be exposed and suppressed. It\r\nwas cloaked under the appearance of humanitarianism. It was planning\r\nto give a series of national rights to peoples who never had the\r\nconsciousness and the dignity of nations—to peoples who had been for\r\nmore than a century instruments of oppressing the Italian elements\r\nunder Austria, under the instigation of the despotic empire. The sun of\r\nour victory was rising, but to be a complete victory, a victory that\r\nwould carry our soldiers on the road to Vienna, it must not falter\r\nthrough false sentimentality.\r\n\r\nThis crisis was sufficient to inspire many great men still under\r\nthe influence of antiquated and rusted democratic ideas to start\r\ndiscussions about the problems of racial differences. They always\r\ntended to favor our worst enemies. The spirit of our nationalism was\r\nattacked and dwarfed by sophisticated and pernicious applications\r\nof sentiment, irritating to our deepest feelings and to our most\r\nlegitimate susceptibilities. Voices of the Italians began to say that\r\nevery time Italy was on the verge of living its hour of joy, glory and\r\nvictory there were always those who soiled the moment, and this often\r\nnot in good faith.\r\n\r\nSummer went by, and in October, 1918, our supreme command, with\r\nfifty-one Italian divisions—to which were added three British, two\r\nFrench divisions, one American regiment and a few Czecho-Slovakian\r\nvolunteers—determined to make a decisive and final drive on the\r\nAustrian front.\r\n\r\nThe strategic plan was a very wise one. The enemy’s front was\r\npierced at Sernaglia; our army rushed through the break. We started a\r\nsurrounding movement, one to the left toward Trento, and one to the\r\nright toward Udine and the lower Piave. The ardent dash of our soldiers\r\nand the ability of our officers brought these movements to full success\r\nand crumbled to pieces the whole front of the enemy. The _War Bulletin_\r\nstates the enormous number of prisoners, guns and war material that\r\nfell into our hands.\r\n\r\nThe army of Austria-Hungary was defeated. Its navy had suffered\r\ntremendous losses. We landed at Triest. We occupied Trento.\r\n\r\nThe final victory was not only a victory of a war. I saw more than\r\nthat. It was a victory for the whole Italian race. After a thousand\r\nyears we, awakened, were again giving a tangible proof of our moral and\r\nspiritual valor. We were living again on warlike tradition. Our love of\r\ncountry had bloomed again. We felt our formidable weight in the future\r\nof a new Europe. New generations of Italians rejoiced, for the Italian\r\ncities were once again rejoined to the country. Trento and Triest, as\r\nour race had wished so long, now were within the borders—the natural\r\nborders which Dante had prophesied and defined in the fourteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIn every corner of the land the church-bells rang, saluting the new\r\nday. War, so long and so taxing, had ended!\r\n\r\nIt ended with a full undeniable victory of Italy in spite of the\r\nbankruptcy of Russia and of the abominable work of slackers and\r\nprofessional destroyers of ideals. For me, every family wore the badge\r\nof a dear one dead or wounded. Widows and orphans of war were proud to\r\nshow the symbols of sadness and glory. We were in Trento and Triest.\r\nFiume was half conquered, while Dalmatia was still in the scale.\r\n\r\nOver Italy reigned almost supreme a spirit of pride and of serenity\r\ntypical of those who have won. War had lasted longer than we thought,\r\nhad diminished our wealth, had supposedly reduced to the minimum our\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nVictory, however, warmed our hearts and our souls. It exalted Italians\r\nand spurred them to higher work, honoring the dead as well as the\r\nliving. From October to December, 1918, Italy seemed like a factory\r\nworking in full blast in complete accord with progress. War had left,\r\nbeyond its inevitable griefs, a deep poetical vein in our national\r\nlife. No one sensed it better, no one seemed more a part of it, than I.\r\n\r\nIt was in this great historical moment immediately after a victory\r\nachieved with untold hardship that our young nation—younger as a nation\r\nthan America—with traditions not yet seasoned by age, in spite of\r\nhaving thrown into the glowing brazier of the conflict men and wealth,\r\nwas treacherously deceived. Its fundamental trustfulness was played\r\nupon in the making of the Treaty of Versailles.\r\n\r\nThis is the awful toll that Italy paid in the Great War—652,000 dead,\r\n450,000 mutilated, 1,000,000 wounded. There is not in our country one\r\nsingle family which during the forty-one months of the war had not\r\nplaced in the holocaust, on the altar of the country, a part of itself.\r\nI know every day, ten years later, that the mutilated, the wounded, the\r\nwidows and orphans of war form a vast proportion of our population,\r\ninspiring the respect and homage of the multitude.\r\n\r\nI never forget. We have gone through a thousand phases of internal\r\ntroubles, from aberrations to a purifying revolution, yet—from Mount\r\nStelvio to the sea, in our mountain cemeteries which the hand of time\r\nslowly effaces—there remains the most powerful citadel of the fortune\r\nof our nation and of our people. I never forget.\r\n\r\nI had been the most tenacious believer in the war. I had fought with\r\nall my warm soul of Italian and soldier. I lived the joy of victory.\r\nI lived in the midst of the unrest of after-war. But in every event,\r\nhappy or sad, I have always had as a touchstone, as a lighthouse, as\r\na source of every advice and of deep wisdom, the memory of the dead.\r\nThey are from every region and from every walk of life, even those who\r\nwere under foreign yoke or emigrated to other countries. They gave\r\ntheir blood and were willing to offer the supreme sacrifice for the\r\nmother country. Until the time when a nation has the right of sitting\r\nwith proud head among other nations, the surest sign of its strength,\r\nthe highest title of its nobility, the vital food needed to reach\r\ngreatness, will always be given by those who laid down their blood and\r\nlife for their immortal country.\r\n\r\nThese are the marks that war made upon one’s body, one’s mind and one’s\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nAbove all, it gave to one, who was still young, an understanding of the\r\nessences of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                           ASHES AND EMBERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flame of war flickered and went out. But the years 1919 and 1920\r\nthat immediately followed the end of the war seemed to me the darkest\r\nand most painful periods of Italian life. Dark thunderclouds hung\r\nabove our unity. The progress of Italy’s unification was threatened. I\r\nwatched the gathering storm.\r\n\r\nAlready disquieting events had menaced our national life. They were\r\ndue to political happenings, even more than to an economic crisis. I\r\npoint to the movement of the Sicilian Gasei in 1894 and the bloody\r\ndemonstration in Milan in 1898. But these manifestations of rebellion\r\nwere localized. Not one of them bore in it the virile germs of\r\ndissolution or of separatism. But I assert that the episodes of 1919\r\nand 1920 had in them bacilli which if not treated heroically are deadly\r\nfor the life of a civilized nation.\r\n\r\nEverything was discussed again. We Italians opened the box of political\r\nproblems and took apart the social clockwork. We pawed over everything\r\nfrom the crown to parliament, from the army to our colonies, from\r\ncapitalistic property to the communistic soviet proposal for the\r\nfederation of the regions of Italy, from schools to the papacy.\r\nThe lovely structure of concord and harmony that we combatants and the\r\nwounded had dreamed that we would build after the luminous victory of\r\nOctober, 1918, was falling to pieces. The leaves were falling from our\r\ntree of idealism.\r\n\r\nI felt that we were left without any cohesive force, any suggestive\r\nheroism, any remembrance, any political philosophy, sufficient to\r\novercome and stop the factors of dissolution. I sensed the chills and\r\nheats of decay and destruction.\r\n\r\nAlready in January, 1919, the Socialists, slightly checked during the\r\nwar, began, the moment the ink was drying on the armistice, their work\r\nof rebellion and blackmail. From Milan the socialistic municipality\r\nsent a special mission of help to the so-called brothers in Vienna.\r\nSickly internationalism put forth its buds in this morbid springtime.\r\nAt Triest the socialist Pittoni played an important part in the\r\nreorganization of the delivered city. In many Italian cities poor\r\nchildren of the old enemy Austrian and Hapsburg capital were asked\r\nto take precedence. It was a provoking sentimentality. A desire was\r\nalready clear in the minds of subversives and of Liberal-Giolittians;\r\nit was to strike out of our memories the sense and feeling of our\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nI knew those who whipped up our degeneration. They were German and\r\nAustrian spies, Russian agitators, mysterious subventions. In a few\r\nmonths they had led the Italian people into a state of marasmus. The\r\neconomic crisis existing in every corner of the world could not be\r\nexpected to spare Italy. The soldiers, like myself, returning from\r\nthe war, rushed to their families. Who can describe our feelings?\r\nSuch an imposing phenomenon as the demobilization of millions of men\r\ntook place in the dark, without noise, in an atmosphere of throwing\r\ndiscipline to the winds. There were, for us, the troubles of winter and\r\nthe difficulties of finding new garments and adjustments for peace.\r\n\r\nWe suffered the humiliation of seeing the banners of our glorious\r\nregiments returned to their homes without being saluted, without\r\nthat warm cheer of sympathy owed to those who return from victorious\r\nwar. Now it again appeared to me and to my friends as if there was\r\nin everybody an instinct to finish the game of the war, not with the\r\nidea of real victory but with content that we had lost as little as\r\npossible. Ears and spirits were ready to listen to words of peace, of\r\nhumanity, of brotherhood between the nations. At night before sleep\r\ncame I used to meditate and realize that we had no dam to stop this\r\ngeneral decay of faith, this renunciation of the interests and destiny\r\nof a victorious nation. The sense of destruction penetrated very\r\nquickly and deeply the spirit of all classes. Certainly the central\r\ngovernment was no dike to prevent the flood of weakness.\r\n\r\nPoliticians and philosophers, profiteers and losers—for at least many\r\nhad lost their illusions—sharks trying to save themselves; promoters of\r\nthe war trying to be pardoned; demagogues seeking popularity; spies and\r\ninstigators of trouble waiting for the price of their treason; agents\r\npaid by foreign money in a few months threw the nation into an awful\r\nspiritual crisis. I saw before me with awe the gathering dusk of\r\nour end as a nation and a people.\r\n\r\nWith my heart in tumult and with a deep sense of bitterness corroding\r\nmy soul, I could smell the danger. Some audacious men were with me—not\r\nmany. My action was at first tied to the urgent duty to fight against\r\none important and dark treason. Certain Italians, blinded and having\r\nlost their memories, were led on by some complicity and selfish desires\r\namong the Allies. These Italians were actually setting themselves\r\nagainst the mother country. Dalmatia, Italian in its origin, ardent\r\nas a saint in its faith, had been recognized to be ours by the pact\r\nof London; Dalmatia had waited for the victorious war with years of\r\npassion, and holding in its bosom still the remains of Venice and of\r\nRome, was now lopped off from our unity. The politics of renunciation,\r\nhelped by foreigners, galloped forward. Wilson was the distiller or\r\nsupporter of theoretical formulas. He could not comprehend Italian life\r\nor history. By his unconscious aid this treason to us was nourished.\r\nFiume, the sacrificed town, whose people called desperately for Italy\r\nin its manifestations in the public squares, who sent pleading missions\r\nto our military chiefs, was occupied by corps of international troops.\r\nWe were about to lose another war trophy—the Austrian navy. Sesana,\r\ntwenty kilometers from Triest, was discussed as a possible frontier!\r\n\r\nI said then that never in the life of any nation on the day after\r\nvictory had there been a more odious tragedy than that of this silly\r\nrenunciation. In the first months of 1919, Italy, led on by\r\npoliticians like Nitti and Albertini Salvemini, had only one frantic\r\nwish that I could see—it was to destroy every gain of victorious\r\nstruggle. Its only dedication was to a denial of the borders and soil\r\nextent of the nation. It forgot our 600,000 dead and our 1,000,000\r\nwounded. It made waste of their generous blood. These leaders wanted\r\nto satisfy foreign impulses of doubtful origin and doctrines brewed of\r\npoisons. This attempt at matricide of the motherland was abetted by\r\nItalians of perverted intellect and by professional socialists. Toward\r\nboth, later on, the Fascist revolution showed so much forbearance that\r\nit was more than generosity.\r\n\r\nI was snatched up in this fight against the returning beast of\r\ndecadence. I was for our sacred rights to our own territories.\r\nTherefore I had to neglect in a degree the petty internal political\r\nlife that was floundering in bewilderment and wallowing in disorder. On\r\nthe international playground the stake was higher. One had to remain\r\non the field to save what could be saved. As to internal politics, I\r\nknew very well that a strong government would quickly put in order\r\nthe Socialists and the anarchists, the decadents and wreckers and the\r\ninstigators of disorder. I knew at first hand their soul. It has always\r\nbeen the same at all times, in all ages—it is the spirit of coward\r\nwolves and ferocious sheep.\r\n\r\nAnd thus one day, a few months after the Armistice, I saw at Milan a\r\nfact more disquieting and more important than I thought possible. I\r\nsaw a Socialist procession, with an endless number of red flags, with\r\nthirty bands, with ensigns cursing the war. I saw a river in the\r\nstreet made of women, children, Russians, Germans, and Austrians,\r\nflowing through the town upward and downward from the popular quarters\r\nto those of the centre, and finally dispersing at one of the most\r\ncentral points of the town, at the amphitheater of the Arena. They had\r\nhad numerous meetings. They clamored for amnesty for the deserters!\r\nThey demanded the division of the land!\r\n\r\nMilan was then considered, more than now, the city where the pulse\r\nof the working nation could be felt. Milan, where I had labored with\r\nideals, had experienced in 1914 and in the first months of 1915 epic\r\ndays for the war. The city always had a strong and gallant spirit. In\r\nit citizenship was more active than in many other parts of the country.\r\nIt had known how to prepare itself with dignity to sustain war effort.\r\nAnd now, after the triumph, even this town, the town of the 10,000\r\nvolunteers, seemed to yield itself to a disease.\r\n\r\nThis procession I said was an evidence of the deep mire in which all\r\nthe classes of the population were sinking, especially those belonging\r\nto the _populari_. As the procession passed through the streets the\r\nbourgeois—the shopkeepers, the hotel keepers—hastily closed their\r\nwindows and doors. They pulled down the roller blinds.\r\n\r\n“There,” said I, “are eyes closing with the weariness of anxiety and\r\nfear.”\r\n\r\nNaturally enough, the revolutionists, observing their effect, puffed\r\nup with new braggart triumph. Not a single force, _interventista_ or\r\nany other, set foot in the street to stop the irresponsibles. The\r\nbeloved tricolor flag of Italy was taken as a mark. It was hastily\r\ntaken off balconies!\r\n\r\nI remember an episode in the shame of those days; a woman, a\r\nschool-teacher in the popular quarters, ran to the defense of the\r\nItalian flag. Risking her life, she stood with blazing eyes against a\r\nherd of communists. You may be sure that in the period of redemption\r\nand resurrection, when we stood upright again, the golden medal for\r\nvalor was bestowed on this woman of saintly courage.\r\n\r\nThe _Popolo d’Italia_, of which I was the founder and editor, lived\r\nthen its life of intense polemics. Every day was a battle. The little\r\nstreet of Via Paolo da Conuobio was constantly blocked by police or\r\nby detachments of _carabinieri_ and soldiers. All the staff were\r\nguarded whenever we appeared in public. One could understand that the\r\ngovernment was anxious about us. The authorities wanted to control\r\nall that the _Popolo d’Italia_ was doing and to curb all agitation\r\nfor virile methods in the political struggle. The censorship was\r\nre-established exclusively and solely for the _Popolo d’Italia_.\r\nThrough a back-door channel a disgusting Socialist deputy tried also to\r\nbring about an inquiry. His proposal was ridiculed out of the door.\r\n\r\nI wrote, on the next day after the Procession of the Defeat of Milan,\r\nan article the title of which was taken from a famous polemical book of\r\nGiordano Bruno—“Against the Return of the Beast.”\r\n\r\nThat article was published in the _Popolo d’Italia_ on the\r\neighteenth of February and ended in these precise words:\r\n\r\n If the opposition to a war that is not only finished but was\r\n victorious is now a pretext for an ignoble doubt, then we who are\r\n not ashamed to have been _interventiste_, but feel the glory of our\r\n position, will shout to the heavens, “Stand back, you jackals!” No\r\n one shall separate the dead. They constitute a sacred heap, as big\r\n as a gigantic pyramid that touches the skies, a heap that belongs\r\n to nobody; nobody can give or take away from the dead. They do not\r\n belong to any party; they belong to the eternal motherland. They\r\n belong to a humanity too complex and too august to be put into any\r\n wine club or into the back room of some co-operative. This political\r\n stew is supremely ignominious. Must we be forced to defend our dead\r\n from filthy profanation? Oh, Toti! Roman! One man! Thy life and thy\r\n death is worth infinitely more than the whole Italian socialism! And\r\n you files on parade—innumerable heroes that wanted the war, knowing\r\n how to want war; who went to war knowing what was war; who went to\r\n death knowing what it meant to go to death—you, Decio Raggi, Filippo\r\n Corridoni, Cesare Battisti, Luigi Lori, Venezian, Sauro, Rismondi,\r\n Cantucci—you thousands and thousands of others that form the superb\r\n constellation of Italian heroism—don’t you feel that the pack of\r\n jackals is trying to rummage your bones? Do they want to scrape the\r\n earth that was soaked with your blood and to spit on your sacrifice?\r\n Fear nothing, glorious spirits! Our task has just begun. No harm shall\r\n befall you. We shall defend you. We shall defend the dead, and all the\r\n dead, even though we put dugouts in the public squares and trenches in\r\n the streets of our city.\r\n\r\nThat was a warning blast—a trumpet call. Many, hit in the face,\r\nfled. Some around us, trembling, thought of the danger that they\r\nmight get into on account of such a polemic. But some others—not\r\nmany—gathered around the old banner of my newspaper.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to organize our resistance, to take care in\r\ndiscussions of international character, to strengthen our position on\r\nthe front of internal politics, to be guarded from false friends, to\r\nfight false pacifists and to confound the false humanitarians. We had\r\nto make a general assault upon all that bundle of various degenerate\r\ntendencies;, diverse in their appearance but absolutely identical in\r\ntheir utter failure to understand the logical and absolute meaning of\r\nthe victory in war.\r\n\r\nOur delegation in Paris was in a sorry strait. The ability and the\r\ninjustice of some of the Allied statesmen had almost strangled it.\r\nOwing to our internal situation, it was impossible for our delegation\r\nto take a firm stand with feet well-planted. The regions to be restored\r\nto Italy were in a state of restlessness that made many of us anxious.\r\n\r\nWhat a grave moment! An action of a handful of us on the public square\r\nwas not sufficient; there were so many different fronts where one had\r\nto fight. We who were to defend Italy from within had to create one\r\nmore unbreakable unity of strength, a common denominator of all the old\r\npro-war partisans and loyalists, of all those who felt, like myself,\r\ndesperately Italian. Then it was that I decided, after days and nights\r\nof reflection, to make a call through the medium of my newspaper for a\r\nfull stop in the stumbling career toward chaos.\r\n\r\nAnd on the twenty-third of March, 1919, I laid down the fundamental\r\nbasis, at Milan, of the Italian _fasci di combattimento_—the fighting\r\nFascist programme.\r\n\r\nThe first meeting of the Italian battle Fascists took place on the\r\nPiazza S. Sepolero in Milan. It was in a hall offered to us by the\r\nMilan Association of Merchants and Shopkeepers. The permission was\r\ngranted after a long discussion among the managers of the association.\r\nCommon sense prevailed in the end; a guaranty was given that no noise\r\nor disorder would occur. On that condition we got what we wanted.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was of a purely political character. I had advertised in\r\nthe _Popolo d’Italia_ that it would have for its object the foundation\r\nof a new movement and the establishment of a programme and of methods\r\nof action for the success of the battle I was intending to fight\r\nagainst the forces dissolving victory and the nation.\r\n\r\nI prepared the atmosphere of that memorable meeting by editorials and\r\nsummonses published in the _Popolo d’Italia_. Anyhow, the ones that\r\ncame were not numerous. One of my fighting friends of good will was in\r\nthe hall and he took the names of those who were willing to sign up.\r\nAfter two days of discussion, fifty-four persons signed our programme\r\nand took the pledge to be faithful to the fundamental basis of our\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nI speak of movement and not of party, because my conception always was\r\nthat Fascism must assume the characteristics of being anti-party. It\r\nwas not to be tied to old or new schools of any kind. The name Italian\r\nFighting Fascisti was lucky. It was most appropriate to a political\r\naction that had to face all the old parasites and programmes that had\r\ntried to deprave Italy. I felt that it was not only the anti-socialist\r\nbattle we had to fight; this was only a battle on the way. There\r\nwas a lot more to do. All the conceptions of the so-called historical\r\nparties seemed to be dresses out of measure, shape, style, usefulness.\r\nThey had grown tawdry and insufficient—unable to keep pace with the\r\nrising tide of unexpected political exigencies, unable to adjust to the\r\nformation of new history and new conditions of modern life.\r\n\r\nThe old parties clung in vain to the rattling programmes. These\r\nparties had to make pitiful repairs and tinkerings in an attempt\r\nto adapt their theories as best they could to the new days. It was\r\ntherefore not sufficient to create—as some have said superficially—an\r\nanti-altar to the altar of socialism. It was necessary to imagine a\r\nwholly new political conception, adequate to the living reality of the\r\ntwentieth century, overcoming at the same time the ideological worship\r\nof liberalism, the limited horizons of various spent and exhausted\r\ndemocracies, and finally the violently Utopian spirit of Bolshevism.\r\n\r\nIn a word, I felt the deep necessity of an original conception capable\r\nof placing in a new period of history a more fruitful rhythm of human\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to lay the foundation of a new civilization.\r\n\r\nTo this end—through every day’s observation of events and change,\r\nmorning and evening, in vigor and in weariness—I aimed all my strength.\r\nI had a perfect and sure consciousness of the end I was driving at.\r\nThis was my problem—to find the way, to find the moment, to find the\r\nform.\r\n\r\nThose discussions over which I presided and dominated strengthened\r\nsome of my conceptions that still conserve to-day the freshness of the\r\noriginal idea. Later, in this review of my life until now, I shall take\r\nup some of the details of the evolution of our plans. At our meetings\r\nthere were present various elements—syndicalists, old interventionists,\r\ndemobilized officers still in uniform, and many _arditi_, those brave\r\ngrenade-and-knife shock troops of the war.\r\n\r\nThe Italian _arditi_ were a creation of the war. The idea was born in\r\nGaribaldi’s impetuous, fighting vigor and dash, and finds its remote\r\norigin in the heroic city militias that flourished in many parts of\r\nItaly at the happy time of the townships—the communes. The _arditi_\r\nrendered first-class service during the war. They were our troops of\r\nassault, of the first rush. They threw themselves into the battle with\r\nbombs in hands, with daggers in the teeth, with a supreme contempt for\r\ndeath, singing their magnificent war hymns. There was in them not only\r\nthe sense of heroism but an indomitable will.\r\n\r\nThis typically Italian formation lived on after the war. The first\r\nfighting Fascisti were formed mostly of decided men. They were full\r\nof will and courage. In the first years of the anti-socialist,\r\nanti-communist struggle, the _arditi_ war veterans played an important\r\nrole. I was several times nominated their chief and still hold the\r\ntitle of honorary president of the _Arditi_ association, which has\r\nassumed now a purely relief character, with the idea of maintaining\r\nintact its spirit of civic and military virtues.\r\n\r\nThose who came to the meeting for the constitution of the Italian\r\nFascisti of Combat used few words. They did not exhaust themselves\r\nby laying out dreams. Their aim seemed clear and straight-lined. It\r\nwas to defend the victory at any price, to maintain intact the sacred\r\nmemory of the dead, and the admiration not only for those who fell and\r\nfor the families of those who were dead but for the mutilated, for the\r\ninvalids, for all those who had fought. The prevalent note, however,\r\nwas of anti-socialist character, and as a political aspiration, it was\r\nhoped a new Italy would be created that would know how to give value\r\nto the victory and to fight with all its strength against treason and\r\ncorruption, against decay within and intrigue and avarice from without.\r\n\r\nThere are some who profess not to understand what Fascismo had as\r\nits intent, and some who believe that it grew without a gardener. I\r\nwas certain at the time that it was necessary to fix, without any\r\npossibility of equivocation, the essential brand of the new movement.\r\nFor this reason I made three planks for our platform. The first was the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n The meeting of the twenty-third of March sends its first greeting and\r\n reverent thought to the sons of Italy who died for the greatness of\r\n their country and for the freedom of the world; to the mutilated and\r\n to the invalids, to all those who fought, to the ex-prisoners who\r\n fulfilled their duty. It declares itself ready to uphold with all its\r\n energy the material and moral claims that will be put forward by the\r\n associations of those who fought.\r\n\r\nThe second declaration pledged the Fascisti of Combat to oppose\r\nthemselves to the imperialism of any other countries damaging to\r\nItaly. It accepted the supreme postulates of the League of Nations\r\nregarding Italy. It affirmed the necessity to complete the stability\r\nof our frontiers between the Alps and the Adriatic with the claim of\r\nannexation of Fiume and of Dalmatia.\r\n\r\nThe third declaration spoke of the elections that were announced for\r\nthe near future. In this motion the Fasci di Combattimento pledged\r\nthemselves to fight with all their means the candidates that were\r\nmilk-and-water Italians, to whatever party they belonged.\r\n\r\nFinally we talked of organization—the organization that would be\r\nadapted to the new movement. I did not favor any bureaucratic\r\ncut-and-dried organization. It was thought wise that in every big town\r\nthe correspondent of the _Popolo d’Italia_ should be the organizer of\r\na section of the Fasci di Combattimento, with the idea that each group\r\nshould become a centre of Fascist ideas, work and action. The first\r\nexpenses—amounting to a few thousand lire—were covered by the feeble\r\nresources of the _Popolo d’Italia_. A central committee was formed to\r\nguide the whole movement.\r\n\r\nIt is amusing for me to recall that this meeting remained almost\r\nunnoticed. The stupid irony of the Socialists and the narrow-minded\r\nincomprehensiveness of the Italian Liberal party could not grasp its\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nThe _Corriere della Sera_, that great liberal newspaper, dedicated to\r\nthis news about twenty lines in its columns!\r\n\r\nThe internal situation in Italian politics and Italian policy continued\r\nto be nebulous and full of uncertainty.\r\n\r\nDisillusion and the shattering of ideals could be noticed, even\r\namong those who had fought. A sense of weariness dominated all\r\nclasses—every one. The Church, which had put herself apart during the\r\ngreat European conflict, now started activity in order to have her\r\nvoice listened to at the peace negotiations and to have a say about all\r\nthe questions that interested the nations that had taken part in the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nSo far as our national life was concerned, the Church limited her\r\naction to the creation of the Partito Popolare—the so-called Popular,\r\nor Catholic, party. It was faithful to some important programme points\r\nregarding the family and religion and the nation. It represented\r\nat that time an attempt to stop the prevalent diffusion of those\r\nBolshevik ideas of socialistic parliamentary systems that were then\r\ndisintegrating Rome and the provinces. But the Partito Popolare itself\r\nran off the rails and jumped the fences; it tried to compete with the\r\nSocialists themselves. Of little and doubtful patriotic faith, it ran\r\nsquare against the Fascisti and the _interventisti_. The Popular party,\r\nalong with the others, was too much in a hurry to close the parenthesis\r\nof the war.\r\n\r\nPolitical riots, disturbances and strikes took place alternately in a\r\nkind of sickly rotation in every Italian city.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary for me to review the conditions which we faced.\r\nOrlando, president of the council, was incapacitated by temperament\r\nto dominate the internal situation, just as he was unable to be a\r\nmaster in foreign affairs. His work was contradictory, full of\r\nfalse sentimentality and failure to comprehend the real interests of\r\nItaly. Not knowing French, and ignorant of the treaties concluded with\r\nthe Allied nations, Orlando, in spite of the presence of Sonnino, was\r\na disastrous influence during the peace negotiations at Versailles.\r\nWilson, so far as Italy was concerned, was ambiguous—so much so that on\r\nthe twenty-third of April the Italian delegation had to leave Paris.\r\nIt returned on the fifth of May—a dubious situation. In June, after a\r\nvote of the chamber, the Orlando cabinet retired. In the meantime—also\r\nin June—serious clashes took place at Fiume between French sailors and\r\nItalian soldiers.\r\n\r\nNever did Italy have a man so damaging to the Italian interests and\r\nprogrammes as he who came next—Nitti.\r\n\r\nHe was and remains a personality that is the negation of any ideal of\r\nlife and of manly conflict. He has a fairly good knowledge of finances.\r\nHe is impudent in his assertions. He is intensely egocentric. He always\r\nwants to play the most important part in cabinets, whether he is\r\npresident of the council or simply a minister.\r\n\r\nHis first act when he came into power was the granting of an amnesty.\r\nThis amnesty was followed by two others. The first had a character of\r\ngeneral principle and I approved it, but by granting the two others\r\nNitti committed a great moral crime, for he abolished the difference\r\nbetween those who wore the ensigns of valor in sacrifice and those who\r\nhad basely betrayed the nation during the war and even had gone\r\nover to the enemy!\r\n\r\nAll the work of Nitti was fish-bait for the approbation of the\r\nSocialists. He conceived the ambition of holding the presidency of a\r\nfuture Italian republic. His measures, which wore demagogic dress, did\r\nnot prevent disorders or devastations sometimes brought about with\r\nthe cost of lives. He never would face Bolshevism and the dissolutive\r\nforces in the open field. He had a decree issued and signed by the King\r\nestablishing the price of bread; he had it withdrawn on the next day\r\nand replaced by another decree, also signed by His Majesty.\r\n\r\nThere was no point in the national life that he failed to bring up\r\nfor discussion. All this puffed up the Socialists. They laughed in\r\ntheir sleeves as they foresaw a strong political success for them at\r\nthe elections. The elections had to take place under the proportional\r\nsystem! The Socialists would become, through the election battle,\r\nmasters of Italian political life!\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that the season was our summer of torment and resolve.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1919, the Treaty of Peace with Germany was consummated at\r\nVersailles. The event for Europe was the end of a nightmare. The\r\ncontinual disillusionments, the reservations and the protests of\r\nGermany and the diatribes between the Allies constituted a permanent\r\ndanger and a reason for anxiety for many nations. The conclusion of the\r\ntreaty was therefore for them a liberation.\r\n\r\nFor Italy, on the contrary, it was a complete shattering of ideals. We\r\nhad won the war; we were utterly defeated in the diplomatic battle.\r\nWe were losing—except Zara—the whole of Dalmatia, our land by tradition\r\nand history, by manners and costumes, by the language spoken and by the\r\nardent and constant aspirations of the Dalmatians toward the mother\r\ncountry. Fiume, most Italian of cities, was contested. The colonial\r\nproblem was resolved for us in an absolutely negative way. To a nation\r\nlike ours, powerful and prolific, that has a need of raw materials, of\r\noutlets, of markets and of land, on account of the exuberance of its\r\npopulation, only some insignificant rectifications of frontiers were\r\ngranted when the glut of colonial spoil was passed around.\r\n\r\nI could feel the discontent oozing down through our masses and\r\ninfecting the _combattenti_ themselves. Once more Italy, who had thrown\r\ninto the conflict men, means, patrimony and youth, went out of a peace\r\nsettlement with empty hands and manifold disillusions.\r\n\r\nThe Nitti government, with its continuous note of pessimism, was\r\ndoing no better than to describe our situation as near to bankruptcy,\r\neconomic as well as political! Nitti himself, his newspapers and his\r\nacolytes, tried to make the Italian people believe that the Versailles\r\nTreaty was for us the best result obtainable. A sense of humiliation\r\nhad crawled over our whole peninsula, but many there were who did not\r\nwant to resign themselves to accept the tragic facts. No one knows\r\nbetter than I that many meditated, in sullen silence, most desperate\r\nactions.\r\n\r\nThe government was watching the turn of the psychological tide, while\r\nin the practical field it did not know what to do except to prepare\r\nand revise the mechanism of an election law by a vicious proportional\r\nsystem. In the field of destruction it reached an unbelievable decision\r\nto demobilize the aviation camps, and to cap the climax, in August,\r\n1919, the report of the Commission of Inquiry on the painful episode of\r\nCaporetto was published.\r\n\r\nI thought to myself, “This is fat on the fire!” The _Avanti_, a\r\nsocialist newspaper that for the time being was published in three\r\neditions—one at Turin, one at Rome and one at Milan—had started\r\na ferocious campaign against the army. On account of a strike of\r\ntypographers, the _Avanti_ was the only newspaper published in Rome\r\nfor two months! During street demonstrations, officers, merely because\r\nthey were in uniform, were insulted and assaulted. Charity toward\r\nthe dignity of the nation prevents my presentation of episodes that\r\nnow make the worst blackguards blush. The few Fascist! that had\r\naccomplished an act of faith in March, 1919, now met in all their\r\nwork enormous difficulties. They were isolated, attacked, spied upon,\r\nsometimes by the subversives, sometimes by the government.\r\n\r\nEvery day in the _Popolo d’Italia_ I wrote about the painful bath of\r\nfire of the _combattenti_, about the inflamed pride of the volunteers,\r\nabout the necessity of concord, about the sordid hostility of the\r\ngovernment that did not feel the beauty and the greatness of the sense\r\nof patriotic heroism. Gabriele D’Annunzio, the poet, who lived in\r\nRome, wrote that his approbation “of my good shots was trembling with\r\nadmiration.”\r\n\r\nVictory was losing her laurel leaves every day in spite of all.\r\nThe national parliament was discussing and approving the new election\r\nlaws. Disorders and blackmailing of the government were on the daily\r\ncalendar. The debates had a character of pettiness and gossip and the\r\nflavor of a base world that knew nothing of war, virtue or heroism.\r\n\r\n“Elections! Elections! Elections!” thought I. “These constitute\r\nthe only subject that is able to rise to its feet in the Italian\r\nparliament!”\r\n\r\nIncidents had taken place at Fiume between Italians and French sailors,\r\nand the population of that city did not hide its growing hostility\r\ntoward the Allies. The latter therefore planned to have the city\r\ngarrisoned by a mixed corps of their troops. So Fiume, a city purely\r\nof virile Italian stamp, had a mosaic of troops. It was the summit of\r\ninefficiency and, what is more, of stupidity.\r\n\r\nD’Annunzio, who was trembling in his solitude, told me that he\r\ncontemplated with grim brooding the taking of Fiume by force. There was\r\nno other way of salvation. Everything seemed to be lost. There were\r\nonly a handful of men with the poet. But they were the most trustworthy\r\nelements of our army. They were old volunteers. They were Fascists\r\nwho felt once again in the incandescent atmosphere of the streets of\r\nRome and other cities the poetry of the war and of the victory. They\r\nstarted, armed, from Ronchi.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of Fiume, at the moment when the English sailors\r\nwere getting ready to evacuate it, was rapid and startling. The\r\ngovernment, as soon as it knew the truth, wanted to rush to offset the\r\nraid. It meditated a blockade, it sent thunder against the rebels.\r\nBut D’Annunzio and his legionaries, having prepared their action in\r\nsilence, now threw down a gauntlet of audacious challenge to the\r\nNittian triflings.\r\n\r\nGabriele d’Annunzio, before starting from Ronchi, wrote me the\r\nfollowing letter:\r\n\r\n _Dear Companion:_ The dice are on the table. To-morrow I shall take\r\n Fiume with force of arms. The God of Italy assist us!\r\n\r\n I arise from bed with fever. But it is impossible to delay. Once more\r\n the spirit dominates the miserable flesh.\r\n\r\n Sum up the article that the _Gazetta del Popolo_ will publish; give\r\n the end in full.\r\n\r\n Sustain the cause without stint during the conflict.\r\n\r\n I embrace you,\r\n\r\n 11 September, 1919. Gabrielle d’Annunzio.\r\n\r\nThe Italian atmosphere, so long checked and humiliated, exploded like\r\nVesuvius after the announcement of the new D’Annunzio gesture. Again\r\nwe heard the tune of high sentiments of fraternity and of enthusiasm.\r\nAgain we felt the spirit of May, 1915. The best of our manhood felt the\r\nbreath of poetry that came from this sacred liberation carried on in\r\nthe face of the policy of the Nittian government.\r\n\r\nThe Fascisti were amongst the ardent legionaries of Fiume, while at\r\nhome they were leading resistance against the defeatists, old and\r\nnew. The Italian colonists all over the world—these colonists who had\r\nfollowed with anxiety and with unspeakable fright the negotiations\r\nof Versailles—sent money in great quantity for D’Annunzio’s\r\nexpedition. Fiume felt an intuition of its salvation. There were\r\nmanifestations of frantic enthusiasm. Audacity had repaired injustice;\r\nthe city was strongly held, so that it could resist by force of arms\r\nand with courage all the Nittian or international interference.\r\n\r\nThe president of the council, Nitti, in parliament on this occasion,\r\ntook an ignoble attitude. He summoned up the dangerous idea of protest\r\nby a general strike. By his ambiguous language he invited the classes\r\nwhich leaned toward socialism, and especially the Socialists and\r\nradicals themselves, to agitate for street demonstrations against\r\nD’Annunzio’s enterprise.\r\n\r\nNitti, after conversations with Trumbic, the Jugo-Slav minister, saw\r\nall his tangled and slimy net of humiliating understandings going to\r\npieces through the will of a few brave boys.\r\n\r\nNitti thought and acted only as a consequence of physical fear.\r\nAttacked full front and exasperated in his mad and miserable dream,\r\nhe plotted with every means to overcome the resistance of the Fiumean\r\nlegionaries. The soldiers were declared deserters. The city was\r\nblockaded so that economic pressure would squeeze the spirit of the\r\ncitizens. Parliament was closed and the elections were fixed for\r\nNovember 16, 1919, under the troublesome proportional system.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  _From a photograph by Brown Brothers._\r\n  Commander Gabriele d’Annunzio.\r\n  ]\r\n\r\nThe elections re-established, for a moment, an apparent truce. Every\r\nparty wanted to measure the masses and the groupings. The Socialists,\r\nwho were speculating on the misfortunes of the war and were pointing\r\nto the danger of another war due to the D’Annunzian enterprise, were\r\nthe favorites. The Church, which in politics always has an ambiguous\r\nattitude, urged on the activity of the priests in the villages so that\r\nthe Partito Popolare, which had been created originally by the lay\r\nCatholics, in service of the church policy, might play the preponderant\r\npart in parliament. The Liberals, Democrats and some radicals built up\r\na block that passed under the name of the Forces of Order. They were\r\nchangeable forces, without any ideal base and without precise aims.\r\nThey were another grouping among groupings whose futilities I had\r\nobserved for years.\r\n\r\nI wanted the Fascisti to try alone the chance of the elections. We\r\ndid not ally ourselves with any other party, even with the nearest\r\nto them—the Nationalists. The atmosphere was against us, but it was\r\nnecessary to count our own heads. It was necessary to know, even\r\nthrough the means of elections, what point had been reached by the\r\nItalian nation in moral disintegration and in moral reawakening as a\r\nvictorious nation. I created an electoral committee with little means,\r\nbut with ample courage. I ordered meetings for the principal towns of\r\nItaly and especially in Milan.\r\n\r\nI remember so vividly the meeting on the Piazza Beligioioso. How\r\ntypical it was! The place was a lonesome corner of old Milan, where\r\nfrom a camion that was used for a tribune on a dark night, by the light\r\nof torches, I addressed a big, closely pressed crowd. They were people\r\nnot only from Milan but from other towns. The Fascisti of Bologna,\r\nof Turin, of Rome and of Naples had in fact sent their representatives\r\nin order to have precise rules and sure orders for the impending\r\nelectoral battle.\r\n\r\nI made on this occasion some declarations of principles that still\r\nstand in the Fascist line. They have served me as a guide in all my\r\npolitical actions.\r\n\r\nI said that revolutions were not to be denied _a priori_; that they\r\nmight be discussed. I said that the Italian people could not copy\r\nRussian Bolshevism. We have in the history of our political struggles\r\nour own elements of greatness of concept. These have given to the\r\nspirit of the time all the strength of their Italian genius and the\r\nqualities of their Italian courage.\r\n\r\n“If a revolution,” said I, “has to take place, it is necessary to make\r\none typically Italian, on the magnificent dimensions of the ideas of\r\nMazzini and with the spirit of Carlo Pisacane.”\r\n\r\nI had already in my mind, clear and strong, the concept of complete\r\nrebellion against the decrepit old state that did not of itself know\r\nhow to die.\r\n\r\nThe elections of the sixteenth of November took place and the\r\nFascisti were beaten. I faced, and all of us faced, complete\r\ndefeat. Not one of us had the necessary votes to become a member of\r\nparliament. Some Nationalists saved themselves in Rome and were later\r\nexcellent interpreters of the national idea in the wallow of general\r\nbewilderment. At Milan, I was a long way off from the number of votes\r\nnecessary to be elected. It was tragic, our record, but in the passage\r\nof time it is amusing and may be remembered by all losers.\r\n\r\nOur uneasiness was now profound. The crowd was anti-Fascist. Under the\r\nskin of the population a sad illusion was being fed; in their minds a\r\ndark hope was stirring. The coming of Bolshevism! The plan for seizing\r\nthe means of production, the installation of the soviets in Italy!\r\n\r\nThe _Avanti_ had already published the general scheme and its details.\r\nMy defeat did not bother me out of any personal consideration. It gave\r\nme a clear and precise idea of the desperateness of our situation. The\r\nSocialist newspaper wrote on that occasion a short notice about me: “A\r\ndead body has been fished up from the Naviglio.” It was said in this\r\nnote that in the night, in the modest Naviglio canal that cuts Milan in\r\ntwo, a dead body had been picked up. According to the documents they\r\nsaid it could be identified as the dead body of Benito Mussolini—his\r\npolitical corpse. They did not say that its eyes were gazing ahead.\r\n\r\nAmidst the general feast of their victory the Socialists did not forget\r\nto imitate a regular funeral. This parade passed through the streets\r\nwith a coffin, surrounded with burning candles. There were ribald\r\npsalms on the air. The strange procession, however, showed the distress\r\nand shoddiness of its ranks; it passed up and down the city of Milan—a\r\ncity that had become now the absolute property of the Socialists.\r\nThe procession passed under the windows of my house, where my family\r\nwas living in anxiety amidst the general anxieties and with violence\r\ntrembling in the air. I have not forgotten the episode, but I always\r\nsee it in its frame—the frame of the misery and of the threadbareness\r\nof the paraders.\r\n\r\nThe elections had given 150 seats to the Socialists in parliament.\r\nThey were themselves frightened by their staggering success. The\r\nsituation was saved by the South of Italy—always more faithful to men\r\nthan to organized mass parties.\r\n\r\nThe victory, of course, swelled up in most Socialists a desire to\r\ndominate. It distended their impudent abuse of power. Enormous\r\nprocessions with red flags, howling in the streets, strikes called not\r\nfor protest but for celebration, occupied a whole week.\r\n\r\nAt Milan a crowd of 30,000 demanded that the red flag should be exposed\r\non the Municipal building. During the cock-crowing over victory, all\r\ninstitutions, rules and regulations and orderly life were upset.\r\n\r\nNobody thought about work. That last of all! Only an audacious handful\r\nformed by Fascisti, _arditis_ and Fiumean elements resisted the\r\nintoxication. An incident was provoked because of this. Bombs were\r\nthrown, a few were killed and many wounded. A commission of Socialist\r\nmembers of parliament, headed by Filippo Turati, marched up the stairs\r\nof the Prefetura, the governor’s office of Milan, to claim my arrest\r\nand the arrest of the Fascisti chiefs.\r\n\r\nThat was an episode of political partisanship useless and evil. The\r\nauthorities showed weakness and fear. They wanted to give satisfaction\r\nto the Socialists. But my clear and straight-lined political action did\r\nnot suffer from this abuse of power. Having been let out after only one\r\nday of imprisonment, I consulted with my associates as to the whole\r\nwork before us. What should we do now? How could we act before the\r\ndamage to Italy became irreparable?\r\n\r\nThe electoral tragedy had broken up our central committees. Many of\r\nus had been arrested; many, threatened, had disappeared. Little by\r\nlittle, calm having been restored, I rewove at the _Popolo d’Italia_\r\nthe fabric of our cause and tried to build again the structure of\r\nour organization. In various meetings I explained the gravity of the\r\nItalian situation. I spoke independently of the particular attitude of\r\nthe Fascisti.\r\n\r\nThe victory of the Socialists was a danger, not so much because of the\r\nfact itself as because of the phenomenal retreat to their holes of all\r\nthe weak and the incapables which followed the day after the Socialist\r\nvictory. That victory crushed the Liberals and the Democrats. For some\r\ntime a low furtive literature of propaganda had spread stories about\r\ndisquieting episodes in the defeated German and Austrian countries.\r\nThis literature spun narratives about professors obliged to become\r\nservants and scullions, Russian princesses engaged as ballet dancers,\r\ngenerals who were selling matches on the streets. All this put together\r\nwith the Socialist victory produced a wave of fright in all classes,\r\nand I could see a serious fact of corruption and political paralysis.\r\nThe old parties had been beaten by pussyfoot socialism. That socialism\r\nhad no aim. It was victorious only through cowardice in the others and\r\nbecause of the general uneasiness in the population. Certainly it did\r\nnot win on any declaration of a great faith.\r\n\r\nI did not fold under the smallest edge of my flag. From my\r\neditor’s office that was getting barer and barer, to my readers that\r\nwere getting fewer and fewer, I addressed the most bitter and severe\r\nexhortations to resist, resist, resist.\r\n\r\nI made a little fortress out of the editor’s office. The newspaper was\r\nsequestrated and censored every day; but notwithstanding difficulties\r\nand lack of means, I succeeded in keeping the little paper alive. I was\r\nthrottled by the skinny hand of poverty. I could have sold out, but I\r\nheld on.\r\n\r\nSo that I might be completely withdrawn from circulation, various\r\nmessengers of the Nittian government came to me advising me to go and\r\nstudy the autonomous republics of Southern Russia. I understood the\r\ndouble game. They acted with me as they acted with D’Annunzio when they\r\nadvised him to try the flight from Rome to Tokio. But D’Annunzio was\r\nnow still resisting at Fiume, and I, with my newspaper, was renewing\r\nand reassembling the dispersed ranks of the Fascisti. I held meetings\r\nconstantly. Not for a moment did I cease my activity. It cannot be said\r\nthat I failed to look the triumphant beast in the face.\r\n\r\nOne day, just after the elections, I had to go personally because of\r\npostal regulations to the money-order window of the main post office in\r\nMilan. I was to receive some considerable contributions that Italians\r\nfrom oversea colonies were sending for the Fiume enterprise. In the\r\nhuge buildings of the Central Post Office one could still see visible\r\nsigns of the elections—the murmur of the discussions, the stenciled\r\ninscriptions on the walls were all there. I presented myself with\r\nmy brother, Arnaldo, at the window of the money-order office.\r\n\r\nThe Bolshevik clerk, with evident irony, said I had to make myself\r\nknown. He did not know any “certain Benito Mussolini.” A short\r\ndiscussion arose that attracted other Bolshevik elements, who amused\r\nthemselves by affirming that nobody knew Benito Mussolini. The\r\ndevelopment of this discussion, impudently provoking, was stopped by\r\nan old clerk of the post office, a faithful servant of the state who\r\ncertainly was not intoxicated by the Socialist success.\r\n\r\nHe said, “Pay this money transfer. Do not be silly. Mussolini has a\r\nname that is not only known now here but will be known and judged all\r\nover the world.”\r\n\r\nI have never learned the name of this gentleman. He was straight and\r\nfair.\r\n\r\nSome symptoms of reaction against the Socialist victory were to be\r\nnoticed now. One day at the editor’s office of the newspaper, facing\r\nthe anxieties of my associates and the doubts of some half-hearted ones\r\nin my service, I felt it necessary to disclose my own hopes and faiths:\r\n\r\n“Don’t fear. Italy will heal herself from this illness. But without our\r\nwatchfulness it might be deadly. We will resist! Resist! I should say\r\nso! Indeed, within two years I will have my turn!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n              THE DEATH STRUGGLE OF A WORN-OUT DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\n\r\nI have little doubt that all inefficient party and parliamentary\r\ngovernments die from the same causes and with the same, typical\r\nmannerisms of decay.\r\n\r\nI have watched one die and have been present to hear the raucous\r\ndrawings of its last breaths. But these were times which tried the\r\nsouls of us. We saw passing before our eyes the dreadful panorama of\r\nchaos and of evil forces which had broken into a gallop, ridiculous to\r\nbehold, tragic beyond words to one who loved his country. Above all,\r\nthese forces were trivial and insincere.\r\n\r\nThe political elections of November 16, 1919, had painted and glossed\r\nover Italian political life with a mere veneer of quiet. Not one of\r\nthe weighty problems of domestic or foreign policy for which a quick,\r\nbrave solution was needed had yet even been put under the microscope\r\nfor study. Everything was boiled up in the joust of political parties.\r\nThere was the usual seething of inconsequential prophecy about the new\r\nministerial combinations.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists dominated the scene. They continually harassed the\r\ngovernment, while it was concerned on account of the attitude of the\r\nextreme left—communists.\r\n\r\nThe occasion of the crown speech, at the beginning of the twenty-first\r\nlegislature, was upon us. For this ceremony there had been some worry\r\non the part of Nitti. He tried to hold the Socialists in check. But\r\nthey could not help showing their cold hostility to the king. I was\r\ntold in advance that they would refuse to be present in the hall during\r\nthe king’s speech.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the opening of the chamber, when the king was solemnly\r\nentering the Hall of Parliament, what was the demonstration? The\r\nSocialists made a parade of their pinks in their buttonholes and went\r\nout in groups, singing the Hymn of Workers and the Internationale.\r\nWith them, making a clumsy show of doubtful political taste, filed the\r\nRepublicans, the Independents, and members of the Left.\r\n\r\nThe speech of the crown did not take a clear position against the\r\nsubversive forces which were menacing nothing less than our whole\r\nnational unity. It forgot the question of Fiume—a torch which held\r\nout a flame for our national spirit. The speech even renounced\r\nsome sovereign prerogatives. It conceded a good share of the crown\r\npatrimony, in behalf of the war veterans, combatants and wounded, for\r\nthey also were full of evident signs of restlessness. Furthermore, in\r\na period when foreign policies were in a snarl and the economic crisis\r\nserious indeed, I could see little else besides the petty shifts and\r\nmaneuvers of parliamentary cloakrooms and corridors in the same old\r\ndisgusting struggle to grab places in the Ministry.\r\n\r\nDuring the first three months the Ministry of Nitti fell three times at\r\nthe chamber. It outlived itself and then succeeded itself.\r\n\r\nThe _Stampa_ an old Piedmont newspaper, liberal in character, began to\r\nbe willing to indict the war. It began an attempt to carry in triumph\r\nthe very man who was the breeder and teacher of neutrality—Giovanni\r\nGiolitti. The Church, together with the Popular party, wanted to draw\r\nthe utmost profit from the abnormal situation. The Socialists revealed\r\nthemselves very badly prepared for their victory. Victory had only set\r\nthem down in a marsh of trouble; I knew that they could not create an\r\nequilibrium between the communists and the extreme right. On one side\r\nit was the nation; on the other politics—inefficient, empty politics.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Gabriele d’Annunzio, in Fiume, was resisting with his\r\nlegionaries the flatteries of political secret agents who, we all knew,\r\nwere pouring into Fiume, and was resisting also the blockade. Fascism\r\nwas again setting in order its disunited ranks, after the electoral\r\ndefeat of November 16, 1919, and the light was everywhere dim and the\r\natmosphere murky with selfish, small, cowardly breathings.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we began to see our way through.\r\n\r\nTo reorganize the ranks of Fascism was not a matter of impossible\r\ndifficulty, because the Fasci di Combattimento—Bundles of Fight—had\r\nlearned discipline and enthusiasm; we could stand our shocks from mere\r\nelectoral vicissitudes. And on the other hand, some strategic\r\nleadership began to show itself at Florence, where, in October,\r\n1919, there was held the first international meeting of the Italian\r\nFasci di Combattimento. What a characteristic meeting! The adherents\r\nwere obliged to defend the liberty of assembling by the voice of\r\nthe revolver. Florence, a city with a tradition of kindness and\r\nhospitality, received the Fascists with violent hostility. Ambushes!\r\nProvocations! Nevertheless, the meeting was held. Our friends were able\r\nto control the place. By great energy they broke down resistance and\r\nsuppressed the unprovoked violence of our opponents.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of Florence wrote the real problem of government across the\r\nsky. On October ninth, by way of starting that sky writing, I made an\r\nunadorned speech. I made clear appeal to the subversive forces of the\r\nnation. On the next day, after a sharp, needle-pointed speech by the\r\npoet F. T. Marinetti, the secretary, Pasella, presented a resolution\r\nin which the Fasci di Combattimento claimed the right to formulate\r\nfor Italy a fundamental transformation of the state. It was a clearly\r\ndefined programme of political convenience and expediency, aiming to\r\ncreate an absolutely new social and economic state.\r\n\r\nI have interpreted and carried out that purpose. If the end I now seek\r\nis to disclose the paths which have led to the development of the self\r\nI am, then surely it was during this period of training and test, of\r\ntrial and error, that the most significant guideposts may be found.\r\n\r\nThe programme of the Fasci was approved to a man. There,\r\nindeed, was the disclosed warning of the Fascist régime to come.\r\nTo the régime’s problem, however, there was being added—and sharp\r\nit was—the problem of the syndicates. For that reason, during the\r\nafternoon sitting of October tenth, I myself proposed a resolution\r\nwhich declared “adhesion to the movement of economic deliverance and\r\nautonomy of the worker.” We sent a greeting “to all those numerous\r\ngroups of proletarians and employes who are not willing to submit to\r\nthe leadership of political parties composed and controlled chiefly by\r\nlittle and big mediocrity which is now trying, by impoverishing and\r\nmystifying the masses, to gain applause and salaries.” I often wonder\r\nif other nations do not feel the same.\r\n\r\nThe whole spirit of that meeting, which closed with a greeting for\r\nFiume, was such as to rivet the old conception of the irreconcilable\r\ncharacter of the fight.\r\n\r\nI arrived at Florence, coming from Fiume, where I had gone by airplane.\r\nThere had been a long, affectionate and definite heart-to-heart talk\r\nwith Gabriele d’Annunzio about all that needed to be done in Italy. On\r\nmy journey back, the plane, on account of the _bora_—a violent wind of\r\nthe Upper Adriatic—was obliged to come down on the aviation field of\r\nAiello, in the province of Udine. Chafing under the delay, I continued\r\nmy journey to Florence by train, where I came just in time to preside\r\nat the meeting and to take what may be called a lively part in our\r\nresistance against the violence of our opponents. At bottom, I was the\r\nmost harassed in spirit of all who were there. But to the eyes of\r\nthe glowing crowd I was a patriot, a preacher of resistance, he who\r\nsucceeded, through the violent articles written from day to day in the\r\n_Popolo d’Italia_, in beginning the smashing of Bolshevism. The meeting\r\nwas ended in Fascist style; we swore to see one another again; we\r\npromised ourselves victory at any price.\r\n\r\nI set out from Florence by auto, to go to Romagna. The machine was\r\ndriven by Guido Pancáni, well known in Florence in his capacity of war\r\nvolunteer and airplane pilot—a great athlete. In the same machine there\r\nwere also the brother-in-law of Pancáni, Gastone Galvani, and Leandro\r\nArpinati, of the railway workshops of Bologna, since then well known in\r\nthe political clubs. When we came to Faenza the auto stopped before the\r\nOrpheum Coffee Shop, where I met and greeted some old friends of mine.\r\nOn continuing the trip, the auto, driven at full speed, crashed into a\r\nrailway crossing with closed gates. Under our terrible impact the first\r\niron railing was broken to bits and the auto was hurled over the rails\r\nonto the second barrier. We were all, with the exception of the driver,\r\nPancáni, flung yards away, like toy men. I, who came out unhurt, and\r\nArpinati, who had been lightly bruised, went shouting for help for our\r\ntwo friends, who were groaning in agony. People arrived, the injured\r\nmen were laid down in our auto, which, dragged by oxen, conveyed the\r\ntwo wounded to the hospital of Faenza. During the surgical treatments\r\nI also helped the two patients. I did what I could to comfort them.\r\nFinally I departed again by train to Bologna. The incident might have\r\nhad greater consequences, but fortune assisted me; I felt that the\r\nhatred of our adversaries had been my talisman.\r\n\r\nAlready I have told how, after the electoral defeat of November 16,\r\n1919, some of my friends were terrified and others asserted how useless\r\nit was to go against the stream. They said—for there are always minds\r\nof this type—that it was much better to come to an agreement with the\r\nopposition, which in those days held all strategic political positions\r\nand dominated the parliament. Compromise, negotiation and agreements\r\nwere offered me.\r\n\r\nI rejected flatly any agreement whatever. I did not admit even one\r\nmoment’s thought of coming to a covenant with those who had repudiated\r\nour Italy in war and now were betraying her in peace. Not many\r\nunderstood me—not even those close to me. Two of my editors on the\r\n_Popolo d’Italia_, my newspaper, asked permission to leave. They made\r\ntheir excuses on the grounds that they had moved from their political\r\nstreets and house numbers. They even accused me of having helped\r\nmyself—during the electoral fight—with funds gathered by the _Popolo\r\nd’Italia_ in the cause of smarting Fiume. So I have seen myself—a\r\nbitter experience—obliged to defend myself from those who had been my\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nI appeared before the convention of the Lombardian journalists,\r\ndemanding opportunity to hear and be heard as to the charges made. My\r\njustification was ample and precise. The board was forced by the facts\r\nto do me justice. And afterward, without waiting for the hour of my\r\ntriumphs, the self-same slanderers, it is fair to say, made honorable\r\namends for their errors.\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile, taking a pretext from this episode, there was\r\nlaunched against me the furious wrath of the Socialists and of the\r\nmembers of the Popular party, led by the priests. Ferrets were sent to\r\nsmell into my life. Soldiers and police were bribed. Secret inquiries\r\nwere made into my every-day routine, into all my acts, all my beliefs.\r\nThe deluded, the rejected, the unmindful—all whom my upright and\r\nfierce soul had fired at in some way or another—gathered against me.\r\nThey could do nothing. In spite of the length and breadth of the\r\ninvestigation, up high and down low, no dragon was dredged out of my\r\npool. As for the disposition of the funds for the Fiume campaign, and\r\nother unworthy calumnies, I published in my newspaper documents and\r\ntestimony which could never be refuted.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion arrived at then has been and always will be the same\r\nuntil I cease to exist: on the score of integrity there is no assault\r\nto be made upon me. My political work may be valued more or less, this\r\nway or that, and people may shout me up or howl me down, but in the\r\nmoral field it is another matter. Men must live in harmony with the\r\nfaith by which they are pushed on; they must be inspired by the most\r\nabsolute disinterestedness. True men, in politics, must be animated by\r\nthe humane and devout sense; they must have a regard, a love toward\r\nand a deep vision regarding their own fellow creatures. And all\r\nthese qualities must not be defiled by dissimulations or rhetoric or\r\nflatteries or compromises or servile concessions. On this ground, at\r\nleast, I am proud to know myself as one not to be suspected—even by\r\nmyself—and feeling that my inmost moral fiber is invincible.\r\n\r\nI believe that this, above all else, has been the stuff and fabric of\r\nmy strength and of my success.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of 1920 found Italy engaged with a most difficult\r\ninternational situation. While in Paris the diplomats were sordidly\r\ndebating, the bleeding wound of Dalmatia was yet open, and in it\r\nwas D’Annunzio at Fiume. The Socialists, to be sure, had obtained a\r\nboisterous electoral victory, but they proved from day to day more\r\nand more impotent and incapable of maintaining their positions in\r\ngovernment with dignity. The most temperate were overturned by the\r\nextremists. There was the gorgeous myth of Lenin! The Italian Liberal\r\nparty had resigned all its prerogatives. The ministry was living from\r\nday to day, at the mercy of political extortions, of blackmail, of\r\nthose who wanted special favors. There was turbulence in parliament and\r\nuproars of political nature on the streets.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions it was necessary to struggle, even though\r\nsometimes victory seemed very difficult and almost unattainable. I\r\nstarted the year by an article entitled “Let’s Navigate.” I said: “Two\r\nreligions are to-day contending with each other for the sway over the\r\nworld—the black and the red. From two vaticans depart to-day encyclical\r\nletters—from that of Rome and from that of Moscow. We declare ourselves\r\nthe heretics of these two expressions. We are exempt from contagion.\r\nThe issue of the battle is of secondary importance to us. To us\r\nthe fight has the prize in itself, though it be not crowned by\r\nvictory. The world now has some strange analogy with that of Julian the\r\nApostate. The Galileo with the red hair! Will he be a winner again? Or\r\nwill the winner be the Mongol Galileo of the Kremlin? Will there be\r\nrealized the upsetting of all valiant and virile thought?\r\n\r\n“These questions weigh upon the uneasy spirits of our contemporaries.\r\n\r\n“But in the meantime it is necessary to steer the ship! Even against\r\nthe stream. Even against the flow. Even if shipwreck is waiting for the\r\nsolitary and haughty bearers of heresy.”\r\n\r\nThere was little time to spare for dwelling upon these highbrow\r\ncontroversies. Events were tumbling over themselves in a most troubled\r\nway. In the month of January, after harsh discussion, it appeared\r\nimpossible to avoid a threatened railway strike. Soon after, the\r\ngeneral strike of the post and telephone employees burst out and lasted\r\nsix days. It disorganized not only the private interests of citizens\r\nbut also state communications. It cut off the shuttle of thoughts in\r\na moment made even more delicate by the international situation. The\r\n_Avanti_, the official newspaper of the Socialist party, of which I\r\nhad once been editor, wrote on that occasion that the post, telegraph\r\nand telephone offices were a luxury of modern times; that the ancient\r\npeoples had been great even without telegraphic apparatus. Who knows\r\nwhether this gibberish came from a mocking spirit or from the kind of\r\nconfirmed idiocy with which extremists are afflicted?\r\n\r\nThe stated cause of the agitations was always economic, but in\r\ntruth the end was wholly political; the real intention was to strike\r\na blow full in the face of the state’s authority, against the middle\r\nclasses and against disciplined order, with a view to establishing\r\nthe soviets in Italy. That was the plain purpose behind all the\r\nornaments and masks. It is little realized how easily a combination of\r\ndisorders can put a whole nation—by control of its exchanges and its\r\ncommunications and cities—in the hands of a tyrannous minority.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of general hardships and of cowardice, of grumbling of\r\nimpotents, of the vaporings of dull critics, I, almost alone, had the\r\ncourage to write that the state’s employees, if they were right in\r\nview of the feebleness of the government, were wrong, in any case,\r\ntoward the nation. To inflict upon a people the mortification of an\r\nill-advised strike, to trample upon the rights of the whole, meant to\r\nlead men from modern civil life back again to tribal conflict.\r\n\r\n“These dissensions,” I wrote in my paper on January 15, 1920, “are\r\nbetween function and government. The sufferer who suffers after having\r\npaid, the sufferer, with the inevitable prospect of paying more,\r\nis the Italian nation—the word ‘nation’ understood in the sense of\r\nhuman collectivity.” And further on I added: “The material damages\r\nof a strike of this kind are enormous, incalculable. But the moral\r\ndamages at home and abroad are still greater. The moment chosen for\r\nthe strike gives to the strike itself the true and proper character\r\nof a support to Allied imperialism. This is the culminating moment of\r\nthe negotiations in Paris. This is the moment in which there is\r\nthe one question—to get, finally, a peace. Why didn’t the postal, the\r\ntelegraph and telephone operators wait two weeks more, until the return\r\nof Nitti from Paris? Was it just ‘written,’ was it just ‘fatal,’ that\r\nthe ultimatum to the government should fall due on the thirteenth? All\r\nthis confirms the sinister political character of the act.”\r\n\r\nAs God pleased, on January twenty-first, the post and telegraph strike\r\nwas ended, but already there had begun, on the nineteenth of January, a\r\nrailway strike. It was a useless strike. The leaders of red syndicalism\r\nhad been willing to proclaim it at any price, even when it was against\r\nboth the sentiment and the interest of the workmen themselves. I\r\ndefined this strike as “an enormous crime against the nation.” The\r\ncountry was in desolation. Italy was in the claws of disorder and\r\nviolence; the foreigners left our charming resorts and byways; the\r\nwithholding of credit grew general among bankers, while catastrophic\r\nrumors held sway over the international world, entangling more and more\r\nour diplomatic negotiations.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the most unbridled egoism, the Fascists firmly held\r\ntheir places during the strikes of the public services. I will not\r\nforget that some groups of our men, inspired by faith, thoroughly did\r\ntheir duty during these agitations. They faced with firm boldness the\r\ninsults and threats of their striking fellow countrymen.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the face of the righteous indignation of public opinion,\r\nsome Socialists began to feel timid. They tried to separate their\r\nresponsibility from that of the leaders who had proclaimed\r\nthe strike. On that occasion, in the _Popolo d’Italia_ of January\r\ntwenty-first, I published an article entitled “Too Late!” I thrust into\r\nthe light—with words that later on revealed themselves prophetic—the\r\nreal situation of socialism.\r\n\r\n“The Turatians,” I wrote—“and by this word we intend all those who in\r\nFilippo Turati, the leader of the Right, recognize their chief—should\r\nhave been awakened before. Now the car is thrown upon the steep slope\r\nand the reformist’s brake is creaking, but it does not hold; nay, it\r\nexhausts the strength of those who are dragging on the lever. At the\r\nbottom there is the impregnable massive wall against which the car will\r\nbreak to pieces. Out of the ruin will come wisdom. This was said also\r\nby the French fabulist, La Fontaine:\r\n\r\n_À quelque chose malheur est bon: à mettre un sot à la raison._\r\n\r\n“It would be preferable, nevertheless, that the blockheads might\r\nrestore their reason without plunging the nation into destruction and\r\nmisery.”\r\n\r\nThe railway strike was protracted up to January twenty-ninth, and\r\nall the time diplomatic discussions were bringing us to disastrous\r\ncompromises in our foreign policy. About this time, into the aridity\r\nof the disputes of classes there was thrust an event colored with\r\nhighest idealism. It was arranged that the suffering children of Fiume\r\nshould be brought to Milan. They had been enduring the hardships of\r\na blockaded town, without economic resources; they were at the mercy\r\nof their own distress. Already the children of Vienna, the sons of\r\nour enemies, had obtained in Milan kind treatment. Was it not\r\nadmissible that there should be found love and pity for the Italian\r\ninfants of Quarnero? The episode of kindness, brought about by the\r\nFascists with the consent of the Fiume command, resounded throughout\r\nItaly. Great manifestations of joy greeted these children at every\r\njunction or way station of their journey. The censors of the press,\r\nhowever, prevented us from writing of the triumphal journey of these\r\nchildren. It was all part and parcel of a programme systematically to\r\nslander our spirit, which always stamped the political handicraft of\r\nNitti, like an ugly hall-mark on a leaden spoon.\r\n\r\nThis man, in order to justify his vile and inept diplomacy, dared to\r\ndeliver in the chamber a speech on the Fiume question with a friendly\r\nintonation toward the Slavians, at the very time that Wilson was\r\npressing his even stranger project to create of Fiume and Zara two\r\nisolated, detached, aborted free cities under the control and the\r\nauthority of the League of Nations!\r\n\r\nOn the next day, February eighth, my newspaper bore on the first page\r\nthe following head-line: “The Abominable Speech of H. E. Cagoia—The\r\nSnail.” By this surname Gabriele d’Annunzio had stamped F. S. Nitti\r\nand the term had become popular. Following the head-line was a short\r\neditorial of mine, entitled “Miserable.” In it, after having set forth\r\nagain in a few words the painful history of the negotiations in Paris,\r\nI concluded:\r\n\r\n The truth is that Nitti is preparing to go back again. He goes\r\n to Paris in order to give away his shirt. Before the stubborn\r\n Juglo-Slavian irreconcilableness our Cagoia knows nothing better\r\n than to wail, weep and—yield. The whole tone of his speech is vile,\r\n dreadfully vile. Not in vanquished Germany, nor in Austria, has there\r\n been so vile a Minister as Nitti. If there had been one, he could not\r\n have lasted. This one is the Minister of runaways, of autolesionists;\r\n he is the Minister of Modigliani, the man of peace at any price. By\r\n trying to remember continually that the objectives of Italy were\r\n Trento and Triest, Cagoia offers arms to the Jugoslavian resistance.\r\n\r\n The peace of 1866, in comparison, is a masterpiece with that offered\r\n by His Indecency. On his next journey to Paris, Cagoia will make\r\n another renunciation. Zara? Valona? Who knows? Quite likely. It is not\r\n impossible that he will yield Gorizia too. Perhaps also Monfalcone.\r\n And why not the line of Tagliamento? Maybe only by this price can we\r\n hope for the friendship of Jugo-Slavia!\r\n\r\n Before such infamy we feel that it would be preferable to be citizens\r\n of the Germany of Noske than subjects of the Italy of Cagoia.\r\n\r\n We have before us days of dolor and shame; worse than those of\r\n Caporetto, worse than those of Abba Carima!\r\n\r\n We will recover our strength, but first there is some one who will be\r\n forced to pay.\r\n\r\nThe domestic policies and the foreign policies pursued by the\r\ngovernment of that time did not fail to provoke some stiff discussions\r\namong those newspapers that were reflecting the varied tendencies of\r\nnational life. The _Stampa_, at the head of which was Senator Frassati,\r\nwho some time later was to be selected as ambassador to Berlin, was\r\none of my targets. I violently attacked it because of the programme\r\nit adopted. It gave itself airs as if it would be the redeemer of our\r\nfatherland. It is necessary to remember that Senator Frassati had been\r\nagainst the entrance of Italy into the World War. He always stood\r\napart during the most bleeding and tragic periods of Italian life.\r\nConsequently, he was the least capable of taking a pose as redeemer\r\nof our fatherland at the time when peace was to be concluded with the\r\nenemies after the victorious end of our war.\r\n\r\nThe _Corriere della Sera_, representing and interpreting the thought\r\nof a great flow of so-called liberal public opinion, was defending\r\narbitration for Fiume and Dalmatia, proposed by Wilson and supported by\r\nthe prose of Albertini, who followed a pernicious policy inspired by\r\nSalvemini and Nitti. The _Avanti_, the red publication, availed itself\r\nof all these polemics and of the slanders against me to libel me in\r\ngeneral before the whole of public opinion. And all this campaign, vain\r\nand ineffectual, was even supported by the press of the Popular party.\r\nBut more important, it was employed against the raising of Fascism and\r\nagainst the war victory.\r\n\r\nStrikes were characterized by violent, disgraceful clashes between\r\npolice and soldiers and the citizens; the interminable parliamentary\r\ndiscussions were marked by fist fights on the floor of the chamber.\r\nThese were pitiful spectacles, humiliating not only to citizenship and\r\nto government itself but to the whole fabric of our political life.\r\n\r\nIn the short cycle of a few months there had been three ministerial\r\ncrises, but Nitti always came back to power. The question, as always\r\nin a democracy gone drunk with compromise of principles, was one of\r\nmutual concessions, and very heavy ones. Miserable. Useless. Nobody was\r\nthinking of the rebuilding of social order in a nation which had\r\nwon a bloody war and which had to face the fact that it was living in\r\nthe presence of a world of moving realities.\r\n\r\nFascism, unique lighthouse in a sea of cowardice, of compromise and\r\nof foggy, plum-colored idealism, had engaged itself in battles; it\r\nwas overpowered by mere blind multitudes. I was the bull’s-eye of the\r\ntarget of the government of Nitti. He unloosed against me all his\r\nhounds, while his journalists tired themselves in vain to note down\r\nmy contradictions in political matters. The Socialists, mindful of my\r\nmoral and physical strength, covered me with their vengeance and their\r\nostracism. At least, they roamed at a distance. They were cautious and\r\nfar off the trail of real things.\r\n\r\nDuring one of the many evenings when Milan was at the mercy of these\r\nscoundrels, I found myself surrounded and isolated in a café of the\r\nPiazza del Duomo, the central hub of the Lombardian metropolis.\r\nWhile I was sipping a drink, waiting for Michele Bianchi, a hundred\r\nSocialists and loafers hemmed in the café and began hurling abuses and\r\ninsults at me. I had been recognized. Perhaps they intended, in their\r\ncollective wrath, to give me a beating in order to place on my person\r\nthe vengeance they had long since had in mind. The crowd, growing in\r\nnumbers, became more and more menacing, and so the owner of the café\r\nand the female cashier hastened to pull down the shutters. She invited\r\nme, according to the fashion of those disorderly times, to go out\r\nbecause I was endangering their interests. I did not wait for a second\r\ninvitation. I am used to facing the rabble without fear. The more\r\nthere are of them, the more a man can move toward them with a sure\r\ncourage which, to some, may appear as an affectation. I cannot say that\r\nthere was any reluctance on my part to face these cowards.\r\n\r\nI looked at the leaders and said, “What do you want of me? To strike\r\nme? Well, begin. Then be thereafter on guard. For any insult of yours,\r\nany blow, you will pay for dearly.”\r\n\r\nI remember the picture of that wolf pack. They were silent. They looked\r\nfurtively at one another. The nearest withdrew, and then suddenly fear,\r\nwhich is as contagious as courage in any crowd of people, spread among\r\nthe group. They backed away; they dispersed and only from a distance\r\nflung their last insults.\r\n\r\nI recite this incident because it was typical of the usual occurrence\r\nin the life of a Fascist. But it must be remembered that in other\r\ncases the end was quite different—beatings, knife thrusts, bullets,\r\nassassinations, atrocities, torture and death.\r\n\r\nIn these days there began to develop a contest between General Diaz,\r\nvictor of our last campaign, and Nitti.\r\n\r\nThe London pact, which had given Italy certain promises, broke down.\r\nThe Adriatic coast-line was in a state of complete insecurity.\r\nAbsurd rumors spread in the diplomatic clubs. The danger of seeing\r\nthe Jugo-Slavians settled along the whole Adriatic shore had caused\r\na bringing together in Rome of the cream of our unhappy regions.\r\nStudents, professors, workmen, citizens—representative men—were\r\nentreating the ministers and the professional politicians. There was an\r\nappeal from all the groups representative of the best Italian life in\r\nbehalf of Dalmatia. All these forces of righteousness, on the occasion\r\nof the anniversary of Italy’s entry into war, organized a Dalmatian\r\nparade, with the object of dedicating, in the name of the fatherland,\r\ntheir indestructible loyalty to their country.\r\n\r\nThen, in the capital, came about an episode which is still vivid in our\r\nmemories. It raised general indignation. The Royal Guards, a new police\r\ncorps, created exclusively to serve the designs of the Nittian régime,\r\ntook the parade by storm. They fired gunshot volleys. Many victims\r\ndropped and some fifty were wounded. This was the most unworthy episode\r\nthat ever happened under the sky of Rome within any memory. And as if\r\nthis assault and outrage were not sufficient, the Dalmatians living in\r\nRome were arrested, including the women. Very few dared to raise their\r\nprotests. Supine victims and bullying authorities were the fashion. In\r\nthe chamber certain deputies, among whom were the nationalist writer,\r\nLuigi Siciliani, and Egilberto Martire, moved interpellations which\r\nfound no echo. From the columns of the _Popolo d’Italia_ I spread far\r\nand wide my contempt. I hurled anathema against the system by which a\r\nwhole people were disgraced. My cry had some echoes in the senate—in\r\nthat senate where in historic hours some great name always rose up to\r\ndefend the dignity, the right and the nobility of the Italian people.\r\n\r\nA group of senators, at the head of whom was the Generalissimo\r\nDiaz, presented the following motion:\r\n\r\n The senate regrets the methods of government which, by tolerating a\r\n want of discipline destructive of the state’s power, diminishes the\r\n glorious victory of our arms and the admirable resistance of our\r\n people. It threatens any co-operative work for the prosperity of\r\n the unified fatherland and the peaceful attainment of every civil\r\n progress. These are methods opposite to Italian tradition, and they\r\n have culminated in the violent repression of a patriotic manifestation\r\n on May twenty-fourth with the arbitrary arrest of Dalmatians and\r\n Fiumeans, guests of Rome.\r\n\r\nAmong the signatures, with the name of Diaz, were to be seen the names\r\nof the Senator Attilio Hortis, a celebrated historian, of Admiral\r\nThaon de Revel, and of many personalities of high Italian culture. The\r\nsigners were sixty-four, among whom were the four vice-presidents of\r\nthe senate.\r\n\r\nThe motion, in addition to its hint to awake Italian tradition, had\r\nstrength and vigor, and disdain for the outrage done to the Italian war\r\nvictory. The leader of that disdain, before all others, was Armando\r\nDiaz. The generalissimo bore about him the glory of Vittorio Veneto.\r\nHe saw from day to day that his fine and lofty idealism as soldier and\r\nchieftain was fading away.\r\n\r\nThe Nitti government—part and parcel of a decadent party and futile\r\nparliamentary system—the Nitti government, bearing the stamp of mere\r\npandering for favor and burned with the brand of politicians scrambling\r\nfor power without regard for the nation and without brave\r\nidealism—fell ingloriously for the third time.\r\n\r\nGiolitti came back.\r\n\r\nAfter so many humiliations and oscillations, parliament and the\r\npolitical system had revealed itself as an assembly wholly unworthy\r\nto control or guide the destinies of a people. At the third fall of\r\nNitti, Giolitti, of whom it may be said that he made the premiership a\r\nprofession, came back upon the scene. His return gave some of us the\r\nimpression that he was a kind of a receiver in bankruptcy for so-called\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\nJustice requires our recognition of a great rectitude in the private\r\nlife of Giolitti; we cannot say so much for his rectitude in his\r\npolitical character. He was a dissolver. He never gave evidence of\r\nbelieving in the deep idealistic springs and streams of Italian life.\r\nAs a creature of the bureaucracy, he trusted the whole Italian problem\r\nto the vicissitudes of democratic and parliamentary pretense and\r\nartificiality. Thus, owing to his temperament, he held off during the\r\nwar. Soon after the victory he returned to the political scene like a\r\nman who had to wind up a business. That business he was liquidating had\r\nbeen certainly the most bloody and yet no doubt the most magnificent\r\nand, in idealism, the most successful in our history as a united people.\r\n\r\nThe disclosed purposes of the Giolitti ministry as to domestic policy\r\nwere good. After the most unhappy Nittian mire, public opinion was\r\ninduced to accept new pilots without hostility. Foreign agents,\r\nprovoking elements, supported also by some domestic political\r\ncompromises, were inciting the Albanian population against us.\r\nThis noble land, which is but twelve hours distant from Bari, and\r\nwhich had always absorbed an influx of our civilization, this land in\r\nwhich some sparks of modern civil life had gleamed only because of the\r\ninfluence we exercised there—all at once revolted against our garrison.\r\nWe had been at Valona with sanitary missions since 1908, and since 1914\r\nwe had had military there. We had built there the city, the hospital,\r\nthe magnificent roads which were a refuge for the Serbian army, routed\r\nin 1916. In Albania we had sacrificed millions of lire and had devoted\r\nthousands of soldiers to maintain her in efficiency and to give the\r\nlittle state a future and a well-ordered existence.\r\n\r\nI knew and urged that it was useless to expect any decided Albanian\r\npolicy from Giolitti. The domestic situation, which continued troubled,\r\ndeprived him of energy or mind to devote to foreign policy. At that\r\ntime the Honorable Sforza was Minister of Foreign Affairs; that was\r\nquite enough to accomplish the last vandalism in the Adriatic question.\r\nMeanwhile our military garrison was obliged to quit Valona, owing to\r\nthe ineptitude of our government.\r\n\r\nWe entered another phase of defeatism.\r\n\r\nIn 1920 there was adopted among the railway employees the systematic\r\npractice of preventing the movement of trains carrying soldiers,\r\ncarabinieri or policemen. Sometimes a similar policy extended also\r\nto the clergy. Against this inconceivable abuse of power, I alone\r\nprotested. The Italian people were suffering passively from a\r\nstupid conception of their opportunities and from blindness which\r\nclosed their eyes to their own power and pride. Those who dared to\r\nresist and were critical of the bureaucracy or of government policy\r\nwere persecuted by the government itself.\r\n\r\nThere was the incident of the station master of Cremona, Signor\r\nBergonzoni, which fell within my observation. He, by an energetic act,\r\nordered the railway men subject to his authority to hook onto a train\r\na car conveying some troops to Piacenza. For this episode, exhibiting\r\nthe most ordinary case of regularity in routine, the Railway Syndicate,\r\ndominated by Socialists, demanded of the Ministry of Public Works the\r\ndismissal of the station master, Bergonzoni. And because the ministry\r\nby its firmness rejected this demand of the syndicate, Milan, which\r\nhad nothing to do with all this matter, had imposed upon it a railway\r\nstrike lasting thirteen days. Milan, a city of 900,000 inhabitants,\r\nchoked by an enormous traffic, found itself incommunicado from its\r\nsuburbs and the whole world. It was thrown back on the use of stage\r\ncoaches, autos, camions, and was obliged to use even the small boats\r\nalong the Naviglio River.\r\n\r\nMilan, our greatest modern city, was in the power of political anarchy.\r\nThose same military forces who would have been able easily to take\r\nthe situation in hand and dominate it were put at the mercy of the\r\nlocal authorities. They were even obliged to ask the authorities for\r\nthe flour to make bread for the troops! The stations, situated at\r\nthe boundaries of the district of Milan, had in store heaps on\r\nheaps of goods; of course these stores decayed or deteriorated and\r\nwere at the mercy of ware-house and freight-car robbers. At length,\r\nafter thirteen days, on the morning of June twenty-fourth and after a\r\nmeeting on behalf of the striking railway employees during which there\r\nwas a fusillade of firearms, with dead and wounded, the railway men,\r\noverpowered by the indignation which had spread through the whole body\r\nof citizens, were convinced that it was better to return to work. But\r\nthe state’s authority was dead; it was now ready for the grave.\r\n\r\nThe Giolitti ministry muddled amid a quantity of financial\r\ndifficulties. Giolitti himself hoped to be able to appease the\r\nSocialists with the project of general confiscation of all war profits,\r\nand still more with a plan to institute a strong tax on hereditary\r\nsuccession. This latter measure, wholly socialistic, would have\r\nannihilated the family conception of a patrimonial line. It would\r\nhave threatened the rights of an owner to bequeath to his heirs his\r\nriches with his name. It had consequences which were not only economic\r\nbut also moral and social. Capital as an institution is only in its\r\ninfancy; the right of disposal is necessary to foster the functioning\r\nand development of this instrument of ambition, of human welfare and of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nIn international policy, Count Sforza, Minister of Foreign Affairs,\r\nconcluded the agreement of Spa, signed the protocol of Tirana with the\r\nrenunciation of Valona and Albania, signed the weak treaty of Sèvres\r\nwith Turkey, and prepared by fits and starts to attempt an end\r\nalso of the question of Fiume. This last happened at the conclusion of\r\nthe treaty of Rapallo.\r\n\r\nThe application of the pact of London, by which Dalmatia was assigned\r\nto Italy, seemed to have been twisted without a single justifiable\r\nreason into something not to be argued. And Senator Scialoia, a\r\ngentleman of the old stamp, said amid the weak voices of the senate\r\nthat the London treaty “has continually been tricked out of force and\r\neffect by those who are themselves Italians.”\r\n\r\nBelieving with all my being that it was necessary to stop the flood\r\nof decadence in our foreign policy, I began to use our Fascisti\r\norganization and the _Popolo d’Italia_. I tried to raise some dikes.\r\nIt was difficult to hold back the dirty water. There was a tendency\r\nto go toward communism whatever the cost. The power of Lenin—I admit\r\nit—had assumed a quality of potency only paralleled in mythology.\r\nThe Russian dictator dominated the masses. He enchanted the masses.\r\nHe charmed them as if they were hypnotized birdlings. Only some time\r\nafterward did the news of the dreadful Russian famine, as well as the\r\ninformation furnished by our mission which had gone to Russia to study\r\nBolshevism, open the eyes of the crowd to the falsity of the Russian\r\nparadise-mirage. Enthusiasm ebbed away little by little. Finally Lenin\r\nremained only as a kind of banner and catchword for our political\r\ndabblers.\r\n\r\nThe aviation fields of Italy had been closed, the machines were\r\nbeing dismounted. There had been, however, some attempts to engage\r\nin civil aviation. One of the most unhappy and dramatic episodes of\r\nthat time came out of the sky above Verona. Returning from a trip\r\nto Venice, a big airplane fell upon the city. The mishap caused the\r\ndeath of sixteen persons, including the pilots. Among the dead there\r\nwere several journalists from Milan. The tragedy affected all Italy.\r\nMourning was general. But to my horror the authorities seized this\r\nopportunity to abandon discussion of aviation and to dismantle the few\r\nmachines, motors and wings which were left.\r\n\r\nIt was just at that period that I wanted to take lessons to become\r\na pilot. The machine which crashed in Verona had been guided by a\r\nneighbor of my birthplace, Lieutenant Ridolfi. His body was carried\r\nto the churchyard of Forli. I had gone to Forli for a rest, with some\r\npolitical friends. My reception in my own home district had been cold\r\nand even hostile. My efforts to be agreeable and my willingness to\r\nlearn to fly just after Ridolfi had lost his life seemed to be quite\r\nwasted. Anything in those days that did not have a material value\r\nseemed to be superfluous. Those were years when men’s hearts were\r\ngray. For the same reason the state for which Gabriele d’Annunzio was\r\npreparing a durable form in Fiume did not catch the imagination of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nBut I did not give up. I repeated my flights. I flew over Mantua\r\nwith the staff of the _Popolo d’Italia_. I was determined to show in\r\naction that aviation ought not to disappear from our vision of Italian\r\npossibilities and progress, to be won, if necessary, at the cost of\r\nhardships. I gave an example personally every time I had the chance,\r\nand my friends did likewise.\r\n\r\nThe growing exaltation of the bewitched masses and the incredible\r\nweakness of the government culminated at the beginning of September\r\nwith the occupation of the factories on the part of the metal workers.\r\nThe occupation of the factories was to be an example of Bolshevism in\r\naction. The doctrine to be illustrated was the taking possession of the\r\nmeans of production. The workmen, with their childish understanding,\r\nand much more the chiefs who were betraying them—and well aware of\r\ntheir treachery as they did so—pretended that they were able to\r\nadminister directly, without an order from any one planned beforehand,\r\nall the workshops, all the processes, and even the sales of the output.\r\nIn truth, though it is not commonly realized, they did nothing but make\r\nsome side arms, such as daggers and swords. They lost not less than\r\ntwenty-one days in forced leisure and childish manifestations of hatred\r\nand impotence.\r\n\r\nThe occupation once begun, the managers, the owners, and the employes\r\nof the establishments were sequestered by the workmen. The trade-marks\r\nand factory signs were taken away, while upon the roofs and the doors\r\nof the factories the red banners with the sickle and hammer, symbol\r\nof the soviets, were hoisted with cheers. In every establishment a\r\ncommittee was formed subject to a socialist-communist set of by-laws.\r\nTelephones were used to threaten all who were keeping out of the\r\nmovement and who, like us of the _Popolo d’Italia_, were setting out to\r\nwar against this grotesque sovietist parody.\r\n\r\nThe seizure of the factories was accompanied by the most ferocious\r\nacts. At Turin, the old capital of Piedmont, which had such glorious\r\nmonarchical and military traditions, the red court of justice worked\r\nwith all its might. Mario Sonzini, a nationalist and patriot, who had\r\ngone over to Fascism among the first, was arrested by the workmen and\r\ngiven a cruel and grotesque revolutionary trial. He was riddled by\r\nbullets and his body was then thrown into a ditch. Somebody had a kind\r\nChristian thought and threw him into the smelter ovens, but, as these\r\nwere extinguished and as cold as industry itself, somebody else thought\r\nto put an end to the poor martyr by beating and kicking out what\r\nremained of life. Sonzini’s guilt was only that he was a Fascist. The\r\nsame fate befell others. To this kind of inhuman brutality not even the\r\nwomen were strangers. Apparently a bestial type of cruelty had taken\r\nhold of men and women drunk with licentiousness.\r\n\r\nThe newspaper _Avanti_ on that occasion reported this barbarous murder\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n It may happen in life for one to be nationalist, to pass to Fascism,\r\n to reflect the tendencies of order and to be, nevertheless, arrested\r\n and shot to death; this is an average stroke of destiny.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of the factories in several Italian towns was merely an\r\nopportunity for violent demonstrations. There were dead at Monfalcone,\r\nthere were dead in Milan and there were dead in other towns on the\r\npeninsula.\r\n\r\nOur credit abroad had been extinguished like a puffed-out candle.\r\nEven after the conclusion of peace, there was little thought any longer\r\ndevoted to a rehabilitation of our nation. One could feel a clear\r\nsensation of collapse. The printing press began to spew out paper\r\nmoney. It was necessary to increase circulation; it was necessary to\r\nhave recourse to inflation to prevent our economic life from going into\r\ncomplete ruin. After ten years, we are still feeling the burden of the\r\nconsequences of that inauspicious period.\r\n\r\nThe exigencies of such artificial finance hastened the wreck. I\r\ndenounced the peril in a series of articles in a debate with Meda, a\r\nmember of the chamber, a man believed to be erudite in public finance.\r\nI can say now that nobody in that murky time had the ability to\r\nindicate any clear course to the Italian people; in financial matters\r\nwe were going straight toward utter ruin—and playing an accompaniment\r\non the strings of his foreign policy, Sforza was continuing his series\r\nof renunciations. He arrived at Rapallo and from that moment Fiume was\r\ndoomed to become a detached, exiled city lying on a bed of thorns.\r\n\r\nOn November fourth the celebration of the anniversary of our victory\r\ngave opportunity for slight symptoms of reawakening. Rome and Milan\r\nboth had extensive patriotic demonstrations. All Italy celebrated. I\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nBut that was transitory. Almost at once affliction came in those\r\nmournful incidents—the tragedy of the Palace d’Accursio in Bologna,\r\nthat of the Palace Estense in Ferrara, and the Bloody Christmas in\r\nFiume.\r\n\r\nIn Bologna there was a bold handful of Fascists led by Arpinati. We\r\nwere aware that the Socialists were preparing, in the red city and\r\nthrough the whole valley, pompous demonstrations to celebrate the\r\ninstallation of the new city government of Bologna, composed for the\r\nmost part of reds. On November twenty-first, quantities of red banners\r\nwere hoisted on the high towers of the City Hall Palace as well as\r\non the private buildings. There had been planned also the release of\r\nflocks of pigeons to bring the greetings of the Bologna Socialists to\r\ntheir comrades of other places. The whole town was in the hands of the\r\nSocialists. They were on the point of adopting a constitution of the\r\nsoviets. The city government minority, composed of elements of good\r\norder, with Fascists and combatants, was present at the meeting. This\r\nwas considered by the reds as a provocation and a challenge.\r\n\r\nThe Fascist group of Bologna, which had its headquarters in a street\r\ncalled Marsala, organized several squads to defend the public order at\r\nany price. In the afternoon the Fascists were being singled out for\r\ncontinuous and increasing insults and provocations. The Fascio—the\r\norganization of the Fascisti—by placards made it plain that it was\r\nresolved not to be bull-dozed, and it warned the women and children\r\nto keep at home behind locked doors. It was foreseen that the streets\r\nof Bologna might witness a tragedy. This firm attitude of the Bologna\r\nFascists, guided by Arpinati, whipped up the Socialists, not only\r\nbecause they felt themselves no longer able to do as they pleased but\r\nalso because physical fear had taken possession of their leaders\r\nall up and down the line. I say categorically that fear and cowardice\r\nhave always been typical characteristics of the Socialist party in\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when about thirty Fascists formed in tiny squads and\r\ntried to go from Indipendenza Street, the open space crowded with the\r\nSocialists, there came a general scattering and a disordered shouting\r\nand clamor. A portion of the terrified crowd poured over to the City\r\nHall and entered the courtyard. The Socialists, barricaded there as\r\nin a fortress, blinded by their own base fears, supposed that all\r\nthe fugitives were Fascists; they feared that the City Hall might be\r\ninvaded; therefore they threw from above, upon the crowd, hand bombs\r\nwith which they had armed themselves.\r\n\r\nThis increased the general terror in the crowd. Many of the people ran\r\noff, tearing up their tickets of the Socialistic organizations.\r\n\r\nWhile these events were going on around the palace and in the\r\ncourtyard, in the Hall of the City Council there exploded a sudden\r\ntragedy. The red members of the council, frightened by the apprehension\r\nof a Fascist invasion, thronged for the most part toward the exit.\r\nSome of them, however, preferred joining the public, composed of red\r\nelements; some flung themselves against the little group of the council\r\nconservatives. The first shots were now heard in the hall. The guards,\r\nnot to be caught, threw themselves upon the ground. The few minority\r\ncouncilors—among whom were the advocate Giordani and advocates Oviglio,\r\nBiagi, Colliva, Manaresi—firmly kept their places, offering a\r\nconspicuous mark for wrath whipped up by fear. Somebody fired. The\r\nbullet missed Oviglio by a miracle. But a second shot killed Lieutenant\r\nGiordani, a _bersagliere_, mutilated in war, hated for his record by\r\nthe reds. Meanwhile, the organizers of the bloody riot were continuing\r\nto hurl bombs, as if they had gone out of their minds, into the square\r\ncrowded with people, and they hit fugitive Socialists under the\r\nimpression that their victims were Fascists. Horrible was the carnage\r\nand the butchery.\r\n\r\nSomething of the same kind happened a little later at Ferrara on the\r\noccasion of a great Socialistic manifestation which was to have taken\r\nplace in the historic castle of the Estensi. A column of Fascists,\r\nadvancing to the spot of the meeting, met a fusillade of lead. The\r\nFascists left on the ground three dead and numbers of wounded. Ferrara,\r\nthe red, Ferrara, in which all municipalities and the province were in\r\nthe hands of the Socialists; Ferrara, which had threatened to arrest\r\nits own prefect—passed hours in anxiety. The same exasperated passion\r\nof Bologna seized the noble province of the Estensi. I felt, however,\r\nthat one could catch a glimpse of tragedies which were mere preludes to\r\ncertain revolution. What revolution?\r\n\r\nI called to Milan the responsible chiefs of the Fascist movement, the\r\nrepresentatives of the Po Valley, of Upper Italy, of the towns and\r\ncountrysides. Those present were not many, but they were men resolved\r\nto take any risk. I made them understand, as I had suddenly understood,\r\nthat through newspaper propaganda, or by example, we would never\r\nattain any great successes. It was necessary to beat the violent\r\nadversary on the battle-field of violence.\r\n\r\nAs if a revelation had come to me, I realized that Italy would be saved\r\nby one historic agency—in an imperfect world, sometimes inevitable\r\nstill—righteous force.\r\n\r\nOur democracy of yesterdays had died; its testament had been read; it\r\nhad bequeathed us naught but chaos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                         THE GARDEN OF FASCISM\r\n\r\n\r\nIn certain contingencies violence has a deep moral significance.\r\n\r\nIn our land a leading class was neither present nor living. The Liberal\r\nparty had abdicated everything to the Socialists. There was no solid,\r\nmodern, national unity.\r\n\r\nIgnorance was still astride the workmen and peasant masses. It was\r\nuseless to attempt to blaze a trail by fine words, by sermons from\r\nchairs. It was necessary to give timely, genial recognition to\r\nchivalrous violence. The only straight road was to beat the violent\r\nforces of evil on the very ground they had chosen.\r\n\r\nWith us were elements who knew what war meant. From them was born the\r\norganization of Italian Bundles of Fight. Many also volunteered from\r\nour universities. They were students, touched by the inspiration of\r\nidealism, who left their studies to run to our call.\r\n\r\nWe knew that we must win this war too—throw into yesterday the period\r\nof cowardice and treachery. It was necessary to make our way by\r\nviolence, by sacrifice, by blood; it was necessary to establish the\r\norder and discipline wanted by the masses, but impossible to obtain\r\nthem through milk-and-water propaganda and through words, words\r\nand more words—parliamentary and journalistic sham battles.\r\n\r\nWe began our period of rescue and resurrection. Dead there were, but on\r\nthe horizon all eyes saw the dawn of Italian rebirth.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy year of 1921 was closed with the tragic dissolution of the\r\nFiume drama. After the Treaty of Rapallo, by which Fiume was doomed to\r\nbe a separate body, the Italian resistance in Fiume made itself more\r\ndecided than ever. D’Annunzio declared that, whatever the cost, he\r\nwould not abandon the city which had suffered so long and painfully to\r\nkeep alive and keep pure its Italian soul.\r\n\r\nI, too, had been living this drama, day by day. D’Annunzio and I had\r\nbeen close together since the first days of the campaign. Now for more\r\nthan a year I had been accustomed to receive his brotherly letters.\r\nThey brought to me the breath of the passion of Fiume. Since the first\r\nmoment of the occupation of the holocaust city the poet had disclosed\r\nto me his firm will to fight. Significant evidence is found in a letter\r\nwhich D’Annunzio had sent me on September 14, 1919, transmitting to me,\r\nfor my newspaper, one of his most virile messages. He wrote:\r\n\r\n _My dear Mussolini:_ Here are two lines in a hurry. I have been\r\n working for hours. My hand and my eyes are aching. I send my son,\r\n Gabriellino, brave companion, to bring you this manuscript. Look out\r\n for any needed correction, and thank you. This is only the first act\r\n of a struggle that I will see to the end after my own style. In the\r\n event that the censorship should be bold enough to interfere, please\r\n publish the letter with the white intervals showing where words\r\n are omitted. Then we will see what we shall see.\r\n\r\n I will write you again. I will come. I admire your constancy and the\r\n strength of your well-directed blows. Let me clasp your hand.\r\n\r\n Yours,\r\n\r\n Gabriele d’Annunzio.\r\n\r\nFrom July to December the situation in Fiume grew more and more\r\ndifficult. In the face of the determined attitude of D’Annunzio,\r\nGiolitti—to be faithful to the engagements assumed at Rapallo by Count\r\nSforza—resolved to blockade the city. The results of the blockade were\r\ndubious; therefore the government made up its mind to occupy the city\r\nby a military expedition. They chose Christmas, because there were two\r\nholidays during which newspapers did not appear. Italian soldiers were\r\nbeing hurled against an Italian city, against a handful of audacious\r\nlegionaries, ardent-souled Italians, the combatants of D’Annunzio’s\r\nbrothers. Blood was on the streets. There were even dead. All Italy was\r\nsaturated with deep indignation.\r\n\r\nThereafter a sense of remorse and conciliation took the upper hand. A\r\nformula was found. D’Annunzio gave up his authority to a committee of\r\ncitizens and left Fiume. It had been held by him during sixteen months\r\nwith invincible faithfulness. Now it was requisite to intrust its\r\ndestinies to its best citizens and to the events which were maturing,\r\ninexorably. I wrote at that time a message which found an echo in all\r\nItalian hearts:\r\n\r\n Beneath all the verbosity and the shuttle of mere words, the drama is\r\n perfect; horrible, if you choose, but perfect. On one side is the\r\n cold Reason of State determined to the very bottom, on the other the\r\n warm Reason of the Ideal ready to make desperate, supreme sacrifices.\r\n Invited to make our choice, we, the uneasy and precocious minority,\r\n choose calmly the Reason of the Ideal.\r\n\r\nA few days later, on January 4, 1921, I commemorated the dead of the\r\nLegion of Ronchi by one of the most fervid articles I ever wrote. It\r\nended with the following words:\r\n\r\n They are the latest to fall in the Great War, and it is not in vain!\r\n The Italian tricolored banner hails them, Italian earth covers them.\r\n Their graves are a shrine. There all factions and divisions are\r\n obliterated. The dead of Carnaro bear witness that Fiume and Italy are\r\n one, the same flesh, the same soul. The opaque ink of the diplomats\r\n will never undo what has been sealed by blood forever.\r\n\r\n Hail then to the Ronchi Legion, to the Duce—the leader, D’Annunzio—to\r\n his living who return and to his dead who never will.\r\n\r\n They have remained to garrison the snowy mountains—Nevosso!\r\n\r\nThe iron necessity of violence already had been confirmed. Every one of\r\nus felt it. Now came the moment to move to action with a clear sense of\r\nthe definite issue. The formation of squads and battling units which\r\nI had drawn up by intuition had been accomplished. I had given them,\r\nin precise directions, well-specified tasks within clean limits. They\r\nbegan their work of discipline and retaliation.\r\n\r\nOur violence had to possess impetuosity. It had been trained to be\r\nloyal, as were the legions of Garibaldi, and above all chivalrous.\r\nThe Central Committee of the Italian Bundles of Fight co-ordinated,\r\nunder my direction, the whole work of the local executives and of the\r\naction squads, not only in the provinces but even in the towns. Valiant\r\nand vigorous elements joined us from the universities. Italian schools\r\nare enriched by the glorious names of students who quitted their\r\nhalls for political life and Fascism. These eager boys left, without\r\nregret and without wavering, a merry existence to face mortal dangers\r\nduring punitive actions against betrayers of our country. Later on,\r\nto these heroes of bold youth I ordered the awarding of degrees _ad\r\nhonorem_; they had given their blood freely so that their nation might\r\nbe saved. Among them was the best type of Italian young manhood, who\r\nby disciplined methodical action, full of impetus, as were the actors,\r\nmet and destroyed the social-communist spiders which in the web of\r\nfoolishness and ignorance were exterminating every life germ of the\r\nItalian people. Wherever there popped up a vexation, a ransom, a case\r\nof blackmail, an extortion, a disorder, a reprisal—there would gather\r\nthe Fascist squads of action. The black shirt—symbol of hardihood—was\r\nour uniform of war.\r\n\r\nThe Liberal-Democratic government quite naturally put difficulties in\r\nthe way of the Fascist movement. It relied principally on the royal\r\nguards—Guardia Regia—blind instrument of anti-national hatred. But we,\r\nwho had sane courage, resource and ability, accepted the fact of facing\r\nambush, traps and death. When instead we were taken to prison, we\r\nremained there long periods waiting for trial. I had an effect on\r\nmy soldiers which seemed to me almost mystical. The boys saw in me the\r\navenger of our wronged Italy. The dying said, “Give us our black shirts\r\nfor winding sheets.” I could not remain unmoved when I knew that their\r\nlast thoughts were of “Our native land and the Duce.” Love and songs\r\nbloomed. A revival of youth, filled with Italian boldness, swamped by\r\nits virile male beauty the unrestrained rages of the irresponsibles,\r\npainted out the fear of the Socialists, obliterated the ambiguity of\r\nthe Liberals. The poesy of battle, the voices of an awakening race were\r\nmultiplying, in those years of revival, the energies of our nation.\r\n\r\nOur dead were innumerable. Italy’s imps, the red dabblers, our\r\norganization of so-called Freemasons who were steeped in political\r\nintrigue, already were seeing the danger, menacing to them, of the\r\ncoming of Fascism. Therefore they used every means to put us down;\r\nthey created their snares and ambushes more and more carefully and\r\nbuilt their pitfalls more and more cunningly. Every day both the public\r\nstreets and the open rural fields of Italy were smeared with the\r\nblood of frightful conflicts. Sundays, holidays and any occasions for\r\ngatherings seemed particularly marked out for attack.\r\n\r\nI restrained our own violence to the strict limit of necessity. I\r\nenforced that view-point with lieutenants and with the rank and file.\r\nAt times they obeyed me with regret and pain. They were thinking of\r\ncompanions treacherously murdered. But they always submitted to my\r\norders against reprisals. They accepted my authority voluntarily\r\nand completely. If I had had a mind to do so, I could have ordered a\r\npitched battle. The boys would have leaped at the chance; they were\r\nlooking to me as to a chief whose word was law.\r\n\r\nThere were evidences of such a deep attachment to me that I felt lifted\r\nup and refined by it. It created in me a deep sense of responsibility.\r\nAmong the episodes I remember the death of a young man, twenty years\r\nold, the Count Nicolo’ Foscari, treacherously stabbed to death by a\r\ncommunist dagger. This fine boy died after two days of agony. In the\r\nagony of the wound and at the point of death, he wanted to have always\r\nnear him my photograph. He declared himself glad and proud to die and\r\nthrough me he knew how to die.\r\n\r\nI was calloused to political battles. My inclination, however, has\r\nalways been against all but chivalrous battles. I understood the\r\nsadness of civil strife; but in desperate political crises, when the\r\nbow happens to be too much bent, the arrow either flies off or the cord\r\nbreaks. In a few months of action and violence we had to win no less\r\nthan fifty years lost in empty parliamentary skirmishes, lost in the\r\nmarshes of little political intrigues, lost in the wretchedness of an\r\natmosphere defiled by selfish interest and petty personal ambition,\r\nlost in the maze of attempts to treat government as if it were a jam\r\npot to attract the flies.\r\n\r\nIn 1921 I tried a political agreement and truce with our adversaries\r\nunder the protection of the government. The utter incomprehension of\r\nthe Socialists and Liberals was enormous. My gesture, prodigal and\r\ngenerous, created solely by me, served only to raise new fogs,\r\nmiasmas and equivocations. The truce had been signed by the Socialists\r\nbut not by the communists. The latter continued the open struggle,\r\nhelped in every way by the Socialists themselves. A generous experiment\r\nin pacificism had been quite useless. Socialism had corrupted Italian\r\nlife. There would be always some irreconcilable antagonists, and so\r\nthe struggle, after a short parenthesis, was taken up again. It lasted\r\nuntil the final outcome, but its renewal was the beginning of the great\r\npolitical battle of 1921.\r\n\r\nI will not set forth all the deadly frays of this year. They have gone\r\ninto the past. But in the houses of my men are burning perennially\r\nthe votive lamps of the survivors and on their hearths is the living\r\nmemory of the fallen. The Fascist legions are of every age and of every\r\ncondition. Many died when the victory was as yet uncertain, but the God\r\nof just men will guide all the fallen to eternal light and will reward\r\nthe soul who lived nobly and who wrote in blood the goodness and ardor\r\nof his faith.\r\n\r\nThe first months of 1921 were characterized by an extreme violence\r\nin the Po Valley. The Socialists came to the point where they were\r\neven willing to shoot at the funeral processions of the Fascists. It\r\nhappened even in Rome. It was at that time that in Leghorn there was\r\nheld the congress of the Socialist party. A schism broke out. On that\r\noccasion the autonomous Communist party was created, which afterward\r\nin all the manifestations of Italian political life played such a\r\nloathsome part. I knew—and it was evident to every one in spite\r\nof concealment—that the new Communist party was inspired and supported\r\nand even directed from Moscow. We were invaded just as other lands have\r\nsince been invaded.\r\n\r\nAt Triest, a city dear to every Italian, which had always kept alive\r\nthe flame of faith and enthusiasm, a great Fascist meeting was held.\r\nAt the head of the Triest Fascists was Giunta, a member of the Italian\r\nChamber and an ardent and valiant Fascist from the first call to\r\naction. He knew, in various circumstances, how to raise formidable\r\nbarriers against this Slavic inroad and against the stupidity of\r\nthe men who had taken authority in Triest. The gathering was held\r\nat the Rossetti Theatre. There I spoke. I set forth our fundamental\r\nprinciples, not only for the Fascists but for all those who were\r\ninterested in a new and complete Italian policy. After a panoramic\r\nexamination of the knotty problems which at that time were vexing\r\nItalian foreign policy, I demanded a complete, definite withdrawal of\r\nthe Rapallo Treaty by which Sforza and Giolitti had signed away Fiume.\r\nI acknowledged, none the less, the impossibility of setting oneself, at\r\nthat moment, against the tragic consequences of the treaty—the fruit of\r\na long disintegration fostered by those who had led us into a morass.\r\n\r\n“The fault of the renunciation,” I affirmed, “is not to be attributed\r\nentirely to the negotiators at the last hour; the renunciation had\r\nbeen perpetrated already in parliament, in our journalism, even in a\r\nuniversity where a professor has published books—translated, of\r\ncourse, at Zagabria—in order to demonstrate according to his style of\r\nthinking that Dalmatia is not Italian!\r\n\r\n“The Dalmatian tragedy lies in this ignorance, this bad faith and utter\r\nincomprehension. We hope to put a stop to these grotesque errors by our\r\nfuture work. We will know, love and defend Italian Dalmatia.\r\n\r\n“The treaty signed, it was possible to make it void by one of the\r\nfollowing means: Either a foreign war or by insurrection at home. Both\r\nare absurd! It is impossible to excite the man in the street against a\r\ntreaty of peace after five years of bloody calvary. Nobody is able to\r\nperform a miracle!\r\n\r\n“It was possible to awake in Italy a revolution in favor of the\r\nintervention, but in November, 1921, it was not possible to think of\r\na revolution in order to annul a peace treaty which, good or bad, has\r\nbeen accepted by ninety out of every hundred of Italians.”\r\n\r\nHaving delineated clearly the uncertain and transitory position in\r\nwhich Italy found herself at that time in respect to the Fiume tragedy\r\nand herself, having shown the impossibility of creating a revolution\r\nwhich would have been premature and condemned to failure, I laid down\r\nand fixed by firm, precise tacks and nails what was to be the political\r\nprogramme of the Fascists in 1921.\r\n\r\n“From these general premises,” I said, “it follows that the Italian\r\nBundles of Fight should ask:\r\n\r\n“First, that the treaties of peace be re-examined and modified in parts\r\nwhich are revealed as inapplicable or the application of which can\r\nbe a source of hatred and incentive to new wars;\r\n\r\n“Second, the economic annexation of Fiume to Italy and the guardianship\r\nof Italians living in Dalmatian countries;\r\n\r\n“Third, the gradual disengagement of Italy from the group of the\r\nOccidental plutocratic nations by the development of our productive\r\nforces at home;\r\n\r\n“Fourth, an approach once again toward the nations of Austria,\r\nGermany, Bulgaria, Turkey, Hungary, but with dignified attitude, and\r\nsafeguarding the supreme necessities of our north and south boundaries;\r\n\r\n“Fifth, the creation and intensification of friendly relations with all\r\npeoples of the Near and Far East, not excluding those which are ruled\r\nby the soviets.\r\n\r\n“Sixth, the recognition in colonial policy of the rights and\r\nnecessities of our nation;\r\n\r\n“Seventh, the reform and renewal of all our diplomatic representatives\r\nabroad by elements with special university training;\r\n\r\n“Eighth, the building up of Italian colonies in the Mediterranean\r\nsea as well as those beyond the Atlantic by economic and cultural\r\ninstitutions and rapid communications.”\r\n\r\nI concluded my speech by an ardent affirmation of faith.\r\n\r\n“It is destiny,” I said, “that Rome again takes her place as the city\r\nthat will be the director of the civilization of all Western Europe.\r\nLet us commit the flame of this passion to the coming generations; let\r\nus make of Italy one of the nations without which it is impossible\r\nto conceive the future history of humanity.”\r\n\r\nThe year 1921 was the centenary of Dante. I was dreaming, in the\r\nname of Alighieri: “The Italy of to-morrow, both free and rich,\r\nall-resounding, with seas and skies peopled with her fleets, with the\r\nearth everywhere made fruitful by her plows.”\r\n\r\nLater on, in a meeting of Lombardian Fascists, I indicated some\r\nlandmarks of the Fascist battle. In a speech that I made to my friends\r\nin Milan I affirmed that by its fatiguing work Fascism was preparing\r\nmen of a spirit suited to the task of an imminent to-morrow—that of\r\nruling the nation.\r\n\r\nAlready in germination through all these affirmations, there was\r\ngrowing the definite intention of preparing by legal action, as well as\r\nby violence, for the conquest of power.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists and Communists, though debating between themselves on\r\ndoctrinarian questions, vied with one another to show themselves more\r\nanti-Fascist than the others. The Communists had no scruples. Every day\r\nthey gave proof of their contempt for law, and they evidenced a foolish\r\ndisregard for the strength of their adversaries.\r\n\r\nAt Florence, during a parade of patriotic character, there had been\r\nan attempt at a communist insurrection. Bombs were thrown, isolated\r\nFascists were pursued. It happened on this occasion that a very young\r\nFascist named Berta was horribly murdered. The unhappy boy, surprised\r\nupon a bridge of the Arno River, was beaten to a bloody pulp and thrown\r\nfrom the parapet into the water. As the poor victim, by a dull\r\ninstinct of self-preservation, clung to the railing bars with his\r\nfingers, the Communists rushed upon him and beat his hands until our\r\nmartyr, whose jellied hands were slackening their grip, finally let\r\ngo and was plunged into the Arno. His body was whirled about in the\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\nThis single episode of incredible ferocity gave evidence of how deeply\r\nCommunist outrage had penetrated into Italy. As if that were not\r\nenough, soon afterward there occurred the butchery of Empoli, where\r\ntwo camions were loaded with marines and carabineers. The proof of the\r\ndegenerative ferocity of the Communists was provided by the corpses of\r\nthe poor victims, for their inert bodies were treated as jungle savages\r\ntreat the corpses of their victims.\r\n\r\nThis was not confined to any one province. At that time there happened\r\nalso the trap and massacre of Casale Monferrato, where among the dead\r\nwere two old Sardinian drummers and where Cesare Maria de Vecchi, a\r\nbrave companion, was wounded. At Milan isolated Fascists were singled\r\nout and attacked by stealth. One of our most beloved friends, the very\r\nyoung Aldo Sette, was murdered with all the accompaniment of savagery.\r\n\r\nBut on the twenty-third of March occurred the culminating episode of\r\npremeditated horror, with dreadful consequences. The Communists caused\r\na bomb to explode in the Diana Theatre in that city. It was crowded\r\nwith peaceful citizens attending an operatic performance. The bomb sent\r\ntwenty persons to sudden death. Fifty others were mutilated. All Milan\r\ngave itself up to anguish and anger and to chills of vengeance.\r\nThere was no possibility of checking public sentiment. Squads of\r\nFascists assaulted for the second time the newspaper _Avanti_ and it\r\nwas burned by them. Others tried also to assault the Workers’ Chamber,\r\nbut a strong military garrison barred the Fascists from an attack.\r\n\r\nThe action squads turned their activity into the suburbs, firmly held\r\nboth by Communists and Socialists. The swift, decisive action of\r\nthe Fascists served to drive from their nests and put to flight the\r\nsubverters of civil order. The political authority was powerless; it\r\ncould not control the disorders and disturbances. On the twenty-sixth\r\nof March I concentrated all the Fascists of Lombardy. They filed off,\r\nmarching compactly in columns, through the principal streets of Milan.\r\nIt was a demonstration of strength not to be forgotten. At last over\r\nthe horizon I had brought defenders of civil life, protectors of order\r\nand citizenship. There had come a spirit of revival for all good\r\nworks. The martyrs of the Diana and the Fascist victims were the best\r\ninspiration. A whole people might now be united in the name of the\r\nRoman Littorio, under the direction of Italian youth—a youth which had\r\nwon the war and now would again attain the serene peace of the spirit\r\nand the rewards of fruitful virtue, of discipline, work and fraternity.\r\n\r\nUnforgettable were the demonstrations for the victims of the dastardly\r\nbomb at the Diana. It was from that day on that there began the\r\nprogressive crashing down and crumbling of the whole structure of\r\nItalian subversive elements. Now they were driven like rats to their\r\nholes and were barricaded in the few forts of the Workers’\r\nChambers and of the district clubs.\r\n\r\nI led a life of intense activity. I managed the _Popolo d’Italia_\r\nand every morning I was able to give the political text for the day,\r\nnot only to Milan but to the principal cities of Italy in which the\r\npolitical life of the nation found its sources. I led the Fascist party\r\nwith a firm hand. I must say that I gave some very strict orders. I\r\nhad an ear open to all who came to Milan with communications about our\r\norganization in the various provinces. I watched the activity of our\r\nenemies. I guarded for the Fascists the clear, clean stream of purpose.\r\nI maintained the freedom necessary for our elasticity of movements.\r\nI wished not to mix or adulterate such a pure and strong faith as\r\nthe Fascist faith. I wished not to blend that ardent youth which was\r\nthe essential soul of Fascism with old elements of trade and barter,\r\ncombinations, coalitions, parliamentary compromises and the hypocrisies\r\nof Italian liberalism.\r\n\r\nAmong the many vicissitudes which have accompanied my existence I\r\nhave always kept an invincible passion for flying. At that period,\r\nso tumultuous, so colored by dramatic hues, every morning found me\r\non a bicycle going and coming some eighteen miles to take lessons in\r\naviation. My teacher was Giuseppe Radaelli, a modest and brave aviator,\r\nfull of passion for flight and happy to have a chance to teach me the\r\ndifficult craft of being a good pilot.\r\n\r\nOne morning I took a seat in a plane with Radaelli. The first flight\r\ncame off without incident. During the second flight, on the\r\ncontrary, the motor for some reason stalled, just at the moment when we\r\nwere executing the maneuver of coming down. The machine veered sidewise\r\nand after gliding on one wing, precipitated us onto the field from a\r\nheight of about forty metres. The pilot came off with some light wounds\r\non the forehead. I had several about the head which would require two\r\nweeks to heal. After an emergency treatment at the field I was treated\r\nmore thoroughly by Dr. Leonardo Pallieri at the Guardia Medica of Porta\r\nVenezia. That incident, which might have had marked consequences to\r\nmy life, was, thanks to the kind treatment by my personal friend, Dr.\r\nAmbrogio Binda, passed off as nothing.\r\n\r\nThis incident, however, gave me the opportunity to measure how many\r\nItalians were following my affairs. I got almost a plebiscite of warm\r\nsympathy from all over the land. I rested, suffering, for some days,\r\nand then I took up my usual activity at the _Popolo d’Italia_, knowing\r\nthat Italy no longer disregarded the part I was to play.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the carnage at the Diana and of the consequent reprisals,\r\nwhile spirits were kindled and irritated, a certain Masi, sent by the\r\nanarchists of Piombino, came to Milan to attempt my life. He presented\r\nhimself at my house, rang the bell and boldly climbed the stairs. He\r\nwas a strange creature of extraordinary mien. My daughter Edda went to\r\nopen the door.\r\n\r\nThe unknown man asked for me. He was sent to the _Popolo d’Italia_, but\r\nwent below and waited for me on the large public square of Foro\r\nBonaparte. When he saw me he came toward me at first rapidly, and then\r\nslowly he wavered. He asked me in a halting voice if I was Professor\r\nMussolini, and when I said I was he added that he wanted to speak to me\r\nat some length.\r\n\r\nThe strange behavior of the individual with the grim eye made me\r\nunderstand that I found myself in the presence of a madman. I said that\r\nI did not give audience in the street; I told him that I received at\r\nthe _Popolo d’Italia_, where in fact he came half an hour later, asking\r\nto be introduced to me. I consented at once and willingly. Masi—who,\r\nI repeat, was a young man with burning eyes—as soon as he came into\r\nmy presence appeared embarrassed. He said he wanted to speak to me.\r\nHis behavior was so curious that I asked him to tell me promptly and\r\nsympathetically what he wanted to say.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment of hesitation he told me that he had been chosen by lot,\r\nin a drawing by the anarchists of Piombino, to murder me treacherously\r\nwith a Berretta pistol. Later, having been caught in some doubts, he\r\nhad resolved to come and confess everything to me, to hand me the\r\nweapon with which he had intended to kill me and to put himself at my\r\nmercy. I listened to him, but I said not a word.\r\n\r\nTaking the revolver from his hands, I called the chief clerk and\r\ntelephone operator of the newspaper, Sant’ Elia, and intrusted to\r\nhim that unhappy man, so ensnared by anarchy and frightened by the\r\nconsequences of his dreams. I wanted Sant’ Elia to accompany him to\r\nTriest, with a letter of introduction to the Fascist Giunta. Soon\r\nafterward, however, the police—informed by what means I know not of the\r\nepisode—arrested the anarchist of Piombino as he went away. This was\r\nthe one clever piece of detective work performed at that time by the\r\nMilan police. They had utterly failed to trace out the dynamiters of\r\nthe Diana even two months after the crime.\r\n\r\nOh, many had meditated upon my funeral! And yet love is stronger than\r\nhatred. I always felt a power over events and over men.\r\n\r\nGiolitti in those days was in a most difficult parliamentary situation.\r\nOn the political horizon there had appeared a political constellation\r\nof first magnitude—it was Fascism. Facing this fact, the president of\r\nthe council of that epoch deemed it opportune to measure the parties on\r\nthe basis of parliamentary suffrage, and he announced the elections for\r\nthe month of May.\r\n\r\nAfter a preliminary discussion the various parties which were pledged\r\nto order, in opposition to Socialist communism, found it expedient to\r\ngo into the elections as a body, which could be defined as a national\r\nbloc.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the bloc—the only motivating and encouraging force—was\r\nFascism. All other parties kept their complexions as subverters in\r\npolitical and economic matters. The Socialist party presented itself\r\nseparated from the Communist party, while the Popular party, which\r\nalways claimed an inspiration of ecclesiastical, religious character,\r\nmoved on the field alone, leaning heavily upon the political influence\r\nof the country vicars.\r\n\r\nIn order to make myself acquainted with the real efficiency of our\r\nparty, I started reconnoitering in several provinces. I received an\r\nenthusiastic welcome at the beginning of April in Bologna, a fortress\r\nof socialism and a barometer indicating the level of the whole Po\r\nValley. Bologna greeted me in a jubilation of colors, with parades,\r\nfanfares of welcome and speeches favoring Italian resurrection. The\r\nbutchery of the Palace of Accursio was still too fresh and red in\r\nmemory. Fascism was in a hot fervor; therefore my presence could not\r\nfail to whip up in all the young men a singular strength of will, hope\r\nand faith.\r\n\r\nFrom Bologna I went to Ferrara, another stronghold of socialism. And\r\nthere again there was waiting for me an unforgettable demonstration\r\nof strength. Bologna and Ferrara are two magnificent towns, centres\r\nof regions exclusively agricultural. In those days I could measure\r\nby my youth and intimate knowledge the strength, the mentality, the\r\nways of thinking and the longing for order of the workers of the\r\nland. I understood that their thinking had lost its way, but it was\r\nnot dominated by red propaganda. At bottom their mentality is that of\r\npeople wise and praiseworthy, who have always been, at the crucial\r\nmoments, the bulwark of the fortunes of the Italian race.\r\n\r\nThe electoral struggle lasted exactly a month. During that period I\r\nmade but three speeches—one in Bologna, once in Ferrara and one in\r\nMilan, on the Place Borromeo. Contrary to what happened during the\r\npolitical elections of 1919, I succeeded this time in getting a\r\nplurality not only in Milan but also in the districts of Bologna and\r\nFerrara. Great demonstrations of joy followed the news. Furthermore,\r\nall Fascism in the electoral field was gaining in undoubted strides.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1919, I had not succeeded in getting more than 4,000\r\nvotes. In 1921 I was at the head of the list with 178,000 votes. My\r\nelection to the Italian Chamber caused a great rejoicing among my\r\nfriends, my colleagues, my assistants. To all my faithful sub-editors,\r\nGiuliani, Gaini, Rocca, Morgagni and others, I recalled the episode\r\nof 1919, when I said to my discouraged and perplexed assistants that\r\nwithin the space of two years I would have my revenge. The prophecy had\r\nproved true within two years. A new moral atmosphere was being breathed\r\nby every stratum of our population. Though not many Fascists entered\r\nthe parliament, the few represented in themselves a tremendous force\r\nfor the new destinies of Italy.\r\n\r\nAt Montecitorio, the House of Parliament, in order to follow the rules\r\nof the chamber, the Fascists formed their own group. There were only\r\nthirty-five representatives. It was numerically a small group, indeed,\r\nbut it was composed of men with good livers and excellent courage.\r\n\r\nDuring the session I made few speeches. I think I spoke five times\r\nand that was all. Certainly I tried in all cases to give my oratory a\r\nspirit and to make it stick to realities. Certainly I confined it to a\r\ndevotion to the interests of Italian life. I put aside parliamentary\r\ntriflings and the tin sword play of parliamentary politicians.\r\n\r\nIn a speech made on the twenty-first of June, 1921, I criticised\r\nwithout reserve the foreign policy of the Giolitti ministry. I put on a\r\nfirm, realistic basis the question of Northern Italy, the Upper Adige.\r\nI pointed out the feebleness of the government and of the men placed\r\nin authority over the new provinces. One of these, Credaro, was “bound\r\nalso by means of the symbol of the political compass and triangle to\r\nthe immortal precepts” of false liberalism—to wit, he was swayed by\r\nthat Masonry which in Italy was representing a “web of foreign and\r\ninternationalistic ideas.” Therefore, I affirmed solemnly: “As the\r\ngovernment of Giolitti is responsible for the miserable Salata and\r\nCredaro policy in the Upper Adige, I vote against him. Let us declare\r\nto the German deputies here in our present Italian parliament that we\r\nfind ourselves at the Brenner Pass now, and that at the Brenner we will\r\nremain at any price.” I took up again the hot, impassioned subject of\r\nFiume and Dalmatia. I assaulted violently the shameful foreign policy\r\nof Sforza, leading our land to humiliation and ruin.\r\n\r\nI spoke of our domestic policy. I stripped the covering from the\r\nSocialists and Communists and made them face Fascism. I pointed out\r\nwith irony the fact that, among others, with the Communists stood\r\nGraziadei, who, at other times, had been my opponent when he was a\r\nSocialist reformer. I exposed to the light the utter lack of principles\r\nto be found in representatives who dipped their paws into this or that\r\nparty group or programme solely for the purpose of gaining petty power\r\nor personal gain.\r\n\r\nThe speech, which had only the purpose of clarification, gave some\r\nneeded hints as to our political action as Fascists in destruction\r\nof the methods and principles of our adversaries. To my surprise it\r\ncreated a deep impression. It had a vast echo outside the chamber and\r\nwas undoubtedly among the factors which finally doomed the Giolitti\r\nministry, like all the rest, to topple over like a drunken buzzard.\r\n\r\nI was not alone in the parliamentary struggle. The group was helping me\r\nvaliantly and with ability. Already the Deputy Federzoni, since then\r\na distinguished official of the Fascist state, had started a review\r\nand revision of the whole work of Count Sforza, Giolitti’s Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs, and particularly of the Adriatic policy. There had\r\nbeen dramatic sessions in which the work of the aforesaid minister not\r\nonly was put under a strict and inexorable examination, according to\r\nboth the logic and conscience of Fascism, but was examined in the light\r\nof the negotiations and treaties, open or secret, which the parliament\r\nhad to know and approve.\r\n\r\nAfter various parliamentary ups and downs, the Giolitti ministry fell\r\nand was followed by that of Bonomi—a Socialist who arrived at being\r\na Democrat through varied captious reasonings. He tried to set up\r\na policy of internal pacification. He was interested in the truce\r\nbetween Fascists and Socialists, of which I have already told the\r\nmeagre results. Just at the moment when Bonomi was developing this\r\npolitical fabric came the tragic episode of the massacre of Sarzana.\r\nThere not less than eighteen Fascists fell. Then came the butchery\r\nof Modena, where the Royal Guards shot into a parade of Fascists,\r\nleaving some ten dead and many wounded. The home policy had not found\r\nas yet, one could mildly say, any perch of stability. I constantly was\r\nunfolding my active task as leader of the party, as journalist and\r\npolitician.\r\n\r\nI had a duel of some consequence with Ciccotti Scozzese, a mean\r\nfigure of a journalist. He was the long hand of our Italian political\r\nMasonry. Among other various imperfections, one might say he had that\r\nof physical cowardice. Our duel was proof of it. After several assaults\r\nthe physicians were obliged to stop the encounter because of the claim\r\nthat my opponent had a heart attack. In other words, fear had set\r\nhim all aflutter. Shortly before that duel I had another with Major\r\nBaseggio over some parliamentary squabble.\r\n\r\nI think I have some good qualities as a swordsman—at least I possess\r\nsome qualities of courage, and thanks to both, I always have come out\r\nof combat rather well. In those combats having a chivalrous character,\r\nI endeavor to acquit myself in a worthy manner.\r\n\r\nFinally in November, 1921, I convoked in Rome a large congress of the\r\nFascists of the whole of Italy. The moment had arrived to emerge from\r\nthe first phase, in which Fascism had had the character of a movement\r\noutside the usual political divisions, into a new phase, in which\r\nthe organic structure of a party, which had been made strong both by\r\nfirm political intrenchment and by the growth of central and local\r\norganization, should be crystallized.\r\n\r\nThe Italian Bundles of Fight had been inspired by an impetuous\r\nspirit. They possessed therefore an organization of battle rather than\r\na true and proper organization of party. It was now necessary to come\r\nto this second phase in order to be prepared to be a successor of\r\nthe old parties in the command and direction of public affairs. The\r\ncongress at the Augusteo—the tomb of Augustus and now a concert hall in\r\nRome—had to agree on the terms for the creation of the new party. It\r\nhad to fix both the organization and the programme.\r\n\r\nThat was a memorable meeting. Thanks to the number of the followers and\r\nthe quickness and solidity of the discussions, it showed the virility\r\nof Fascism. My point of view won an overwhelming victory in that\r\nmeeting. The Italian Bundles of Fight were now transforming themselves.\r\nThey were to receive the new denomination of Fascist National party,\r\nwith a central directory and supreme council over the provincial\r\norganizations and the lesser Fascist sections which were to be created\r\nin every locality. On that occasion I wanted with all my desire to\r\nstrip from our party the personal character which the Fascist movement\r\nhad assumed because of the stamp of my will. But the more I wished to\r\ngive the party an autonomous organization and the more I tried, the\r\nmore I received the conviction from the evidence of the facts that the\r\nparty could not have existed and lived and could not be triumphant\r\nexcept under my command, my guidance, my support and my spurs.\r\n\r\nThe meeting in Rome gave a deep insight into the fundamental strength\r\nof Fascism, but especially for me it was a revelation of my\r\npersonal strength. But there were several unpleasant incidents. There\r\nhad been some men killed in Rome. The workers’ quarter of Rome was\r\nhostile to us. The work of the congress had, however, its full and\r\nnormal development, and the parade of Fascists at last filed off in\r\nbattle array through the streets of Rome. It served notice to everybody\r\nthat Fascism was ripe as a party, and as an instrumentality with the\r\nheart and the means to battle and to defend itself.\r\n\r\nThe Bonomi ministry developed its pacification policy in the midst\r\nof difficulties of all kinds. The time and the moment were rather\r\nmurky. The year 1921 presented difficulties which would have made any\r\npolitician shiver. On the horizon a line of clarification was to be\r\ndiscerned, but the sky was nevertheless still heavy with old clouds.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of this formless, gray year, awaiting a great dawn,\r\noccurred an event in the financial world which threw a shadow of\r\nsorrow over the whole land. This was the crash of the Banca Italiana\r\ndi Sconto. The collapse was felt particularly in the southern part of\r\nItaly by the humble classes who had deposited their savings in that\r\nbank. This great banking institution had been born during the war and\r\nhad done notable service for the organization of our efficiency, but\r\nin the postwar period it could not bear the burden of its engagements.\r\nThe big banking organization, in which the laboring populations of the\r\nSouth and of Upper Italy were interested so deeply, crumbled on itself,\r\ngiving all the postwar Italian financial policy a sensation of dismay\r\nand failure. Ignorance, foolishness, fault, levity? Who knows?\r\n\r\nCertainly our credit as a power and as a rebuilding force in comparison\r\nwith foreign countries diminished enormously. To the faults of our\r\ndomestic policy was added now, in the eyes of the world, a plutocratic\r\nand financial insufficiency.\r\n\r\nFrom the broils of financial chaos and in the maze of debates which\r\nensued, Fascism kept itself aloof. It delayed not to consider the past,\r\nbut chose to determine carefully a sound, wise and foreseeing monetary\r\npolicy for the nation.\r\n\r\nFor the first time I found myself squarely challenged by the gigantic\r\nproblem of public finance.\r\n\r\nFor me it was a new airplane—and there was no competent instructor\r\nanywhere on our field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                       TOWARD CONQUEST OF POWER\r\n\r\n\r\nFinance, the proper use and easy flow of capital, and the development\r\nof the banking structure of a nation must not be underestimated when\r\none has to face the clear responsibility of building a state or of\r\nleading a people out of chaos.\r\n\r\nThe noisy crash of the great Banca Italiana di Sconto in Italy\r\nrevealed, as I have said, a deep weakness in our economic structure.\r\nAfter the war it was clear that many banking and industrial enterprises\r\nwere out of adjustment and must disappear or be succeeded by stronger\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThere were struggles between opposing groups of capitalists. These\r\ncreated a cynical attitude among the modern middle class; at the same\r\ntime it was shown that our capitalistic industrial group resented the\r\nvice of having no comprehensive plan. We needed a strong capitalistic\r\ntradition, rigorous experience; we found that in the whir of events it\r\nwas difficult to perceive who was right and who would probably be able\r\nto save himself, when the pressure came and a test of strength was made.\r\n\r\nThe other nations, who saw deeply into this strange cauldron through\r\nthe cold eyes of their financiers, made dark prophecies as to our\r\neconomic life. The Italian government itself did not know how\r\nto behave in its money affairs, and, not finding anything better,\r\ndid as is often done in such circumstances—began to print money.\r\nThat contributed to render a situation which was already bad and\r\ncomplicated, grotesquely worse.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1922, the Inter-Allied Conference was held at Cannes\r\nin southern France. It was a very good junket and it was made more\r\npleasant by the fine hospitality of the French. I went there to serve\r\nmy newspaper, the _Popolo d’Italia_. What an excellent occasion it\r\nwas to distract public opinion from our internal crisis, at least\r\ntemporarily! We could examine thoroughly, instead of domestic thorns,\r\nproblems of international character!\r\n\r\nAt Cannes I wanted to interview the great world politicians—responsible\r\nmen. I would have liked, from a full survey, to have informed Italian\r\npublic opinion as to the various ingredients which we could find in the\r\npudding of our international situation. The Cannes conference was the\r\noverture to the opera of the conference in Genoa. Italy should have\r\nselected her own policy. It should have been one which would not betray\r\nvital interests arising from our most urgent historic and political\r\nnecessities.\r\n\r\nAt any rate because of these considerations, I decided to go to\r\nCannes. I collected ten thousand lire for necessary expenses. My\r\nbrother, Arnaldo, went to convert them at a money changer and brought\r\nme the equivalent in French money, which amounted to no more than\r\nfive thousand, two hundred francs. Though I had followed the\r\ncourse of foreign exchange this little personal experience made a deep\r\nimpression. It made me realize an angular fact; the Italian currency\r\nhad lost nearly half of its value in comparison to French currency! It\r\nwas a grave symptom. It was a humiliation. It was a blow to the self\r\nrespect of a victorious nation, a vexing weathervane; it indicated\r\nour progress toward bankruptcy! Up leaped the thought that this\r\nsituation must be cured by the vital strength of Fascism. It was one\r\nof our opportunities; the desperate developments unfortunately had not\r\ncompelled the government, or political parties, or parliament itself to\r\nact. The monstrosity of inflation instead gave to everybody a fatuous,\r\ninconsistent, artificial sense of prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe Cannes conference had no importance; it was a preface for Genoa. It\r\nwas clothed in an atmosphere of indifference. International meetings\r\nhad followed each other with tiresome regularity here and there in\r\nresorts of Europe which appeared pleasant places to hold meetings.\r\nThe last reunions had lost interest and were, instead of being\r\nimportant, the object of newspaper satire and of mocking “couplets”\r\nin comic reviews. To me, however, the sojourn at Cannes gave a means\r\nof extracting personally, from a direct and realistic examination of\r\npeoples and events, deep and well-rooted conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe Cannes conference had provoked a sudden ministerial crisis in\r\nFrance. Briand, whom I interviewed in the course of these days,\r\nresigned without waiting for a vote of the Chamber of Deputies. And\r\nI, in an article of January 14th, 1922, entitled “After Cannes,”\r\nhaving given due weight to the numerous sharp interrogation marks of\r\nthe international situation, concluded:\r\n\r\n“The unsolved problems, questionings and challenges could be ranged\r\nin line to infinity. It is urgent, instead, to take note of the most\r\nimportant lesson of the French crisis. It is a bitter verification.\r\nIt will bring the masses of the populations who suffer morally and\r\neconomically to say in their hearts, ‘These gentlemen are either\r\nwithout conscience, or they are powerless and flabby. They either have\r\nno wish to make peace or they are not able to make it. A Europe in such\r\nterrible spiritual and economic conditions as those of the present must\r\nembark on reason or sink. The Europe of to-morrow, broken in divisions\r\nof impoverished peoples, may become a colony: two other continents are\r\nalready high up on the horizon of history!’”\r\n\r\nTo the plight disclosed by the wide picture of the European horizon\r\nunfolding to my eyes, was to be added that due to our domestic\r\ntroubles, always growing a little worse.\r\n\r\nI have always spoken as a journalist, as a politician, as a deputy, of\r\nthe existence of two Italies. One appeared to me freed from servitude.\r\nIt was noble, proud, loyal, devoutly dedicated by a bloody sacrifice of\r\nwar, resolved to be always in the first rank to defend the right, the\r\nprivilege and the great name of the Italian people. On the other side,\r\nhowever, I saw another Italy, dull to any consciousness of nobility and\r\npower, indifferent to origin and traditions, serving obscure “isms,”\r\na slave to apathetic tendencies, cold, egotistic, incapable of\r\ngallantry, dead to sacrifice.\r\n\r\nIn a thousand hardships, in numerous fights, those two Italies were\r\narrayed by immutable destiny one against the other; their opposition\r\nwas revealed in bloody manifestations, typical of the fierce and final\r\nstruggle between the Fascisti and their enemies. To see in its right\r\nlight the character of this antithesis, let us examine some of the\r\ntypical episodes.\r\n\r\nIn Pistoia, for instance, a brave officer, Lieutenant Federico Florio,\r\nwho fought valiantly during the War and who had followed D’Annunzio\r\nin Fiume, was treacherously murdered by a deserter anarchist, Cafiero\r\nLucchesi. It was a crime premeditated by a craven to strike down a\r\ngallant man. This criminal outrage filled the souls of the Fascisti\r\nwith utter indignation. The last words of our martyr were simple and\r\nsolemn, “I am sorry now I will not be able to do something else for my\r\nCountry.” No more. Then the agony came. I felt that such sacrifices\r\ncemented indissolubly the unity of Fascism.\r\n\r\n“A formidable cement!” I wrote in my paper. “It binds the Fascisti\r\nlegions; a sacred and intangible bond keeps close the faithful of the\r\nLittorio. It is the sacred bond of our dead. They are hundreds. Youths.\r\nMature men. Not a party in Italy, nor any movement in recent Italian\r\nhistory can be compared to Fascism. Not one ideal has been like the\r\nFascist—consecrated by the blood of so many young souls.\r\n\r\n“If Fascism were not a faith, how did it or could it give stoicism\r\nand courage to its legions? Only a faith which has reached the heights,\r\nonly a faith can suggest those words that came out from the lips\r\nof Federico Florio, already bloodless and gray. Those words are a\r\ndocument; they are a testament. They are as simple and as grave as a\r\npassage from the Gospel.\r\n\r\n“The Fascisti of all Italy must receive and meditate these words—in\r\nsilence—but unceasingly marching, always more determined—toward the\r\ngoal! No obstacle will ever stop them.”\r\n\r\nAll of us had full realization of the command and the impulse which\r\ncame from the dead. When faith leaps out of the hearts of martyrs it\r\ncarries irresistibly the sure impression of nobility, and brands men\r\nwith the symbol of its eternal greatness.\r\n\r\nThe groups of the Fascisti, their meetings, their compact parades,\r\nand their services in patriotism had as ideal leaders our martyrs,\r\ninvincible knights of the Fascist faith and passion. We called them by\r\nname, one by one, with firm and sure voice. At every name, the comrades\r\nanswered, “Present.” This was a simple rite; it had all the value and\r\nthe affirmation of a vow.\r\n\r\nQuite an opposite symptom of the two contrasting Italies was plainly\r\nmanifested in the politics displayed by the two senators, Credaro\r\nand Salata, who were in border zones, as high commissioners of the\r\ngovernment. These two men seemed to ask from the natives who were\r\nnot of Italian blood a kind of mercy and tolerance for the fact that\r\nthey themselves were Italians. No demand of the German-speaking\r\npeople on the frontier was considered unjustified. Little\r\nby little, following that policy of cowardice and servitude, we\r\nrenounced our well-defined rights, sanctified by the blood spilled by\r\nvolunteer heroes. Already in June, 1921—as I said in the preceding\r\nchapter—without mincing words I had denounced and ridiculed in the\r\npresence of all the chamber of parliament the work done by Credaro and\r\nSalata. Their destructive, eroding activity, however, continued. The\r\nFascisti, confronted by successive proofs of such innate and inane\r\nweakness, were roused; they accused the two governors with violent\r\nwords. On January 17th, 1922, at the meeting held in Triest, the\r\nFascisti demanded the recall of Salata and the suppression of the\r\ncentral office for the New Provinces. That campaign succeeded in making\r\nits own way some time afterward. In fact the two senators, Credaro and\r\nSalata were recalled even though they were replaced by the government.\r\nBut the consequence of their errors were to be suffered for a weary\r\ntime. Quite differently, with pride and dignity, would the black shirts\r\nhave garrisoned the sacred limits of the Brenner and the Nevosso.\r\n\r\nIn that period of bitter charges, counter charges, debates and\r\nsquabbles, while the European horizon was still filled with thunder\r\nstorms, came the death of the Pontiff Benedict XV, Giacomo della\r\nChiesa, of a noble family of Genoa. He passed away January 22nd, 1922.\r\nHe had ruled the Church in the stormiest period of the war, following\r\nPius X, the kind-hearted patriarch of Venice, who distinguished his\r\npontificate by a strong battle against the fads of political and\r\nreligious modernism.\r\n\r\nBenedict XV did not leave in our souls a sympathetic memory. We could\r\nnot, if we tried, forget that in 1917, while people were struggling,\r\nwhen we had already seen the fall of Czarism and the Russian revolution\r\nwith the defection of the armies on the eastern front, the Pontiff\r\ndefined the war with the unhappy expression, “a useless massacre.”\r\nThat phrase, inconceivable in such a terrible moment, was a blow to\r\nthose who had faith in sacrifice for an ideal and who hoped the war\r\nwould correct many deep-rooted historical injustices. Besides, war had\r\nbeen our invention; the Catholic Church had ever been a stranger to\r\nwars, when she did not provoke them herself. And yet, the ambiguous\r\nconduct of the Pope amid the fighting nations is considered nowadays by\r\nsome zealous persons who are deficient in critical sense and blind to\r\nhistorical consciousness, as the maximum of equity and the essence of\r\nan objective spirit.\r\n\r\nBut that attitude and its expression had, for us Italians, a very\r\ndifferent value. It served to make evident an anomalous phase of\r\nItaly’s situation—that is, the position of the Pontiff in Rome during\r\na period in which Italy was engaged in a terrible struggle. For that\r\nreason, on the death of Benedict XV, the succession to the pontificate\r\ntook on at that moment a particular importance for the future.\r\n\r\nThere is a saying in our country which is applied to the most\r\nextraordinary events to imply that the most complex things can be\r\nreduced to very simple terms. The expression is, “When a Pope is\r\ndead, another one is made.” There is no comment to be made on that\r\nsimple statement. But to succeed to the throne of St. Peter,\r\nto become the worthy substitute for the Prince of the Apostles, to\r\nrepresent on earth the Divinity of Christ, is one thing; the weight and\r\nvalue of a conclusion reached by an elective assembly is another. In\r\nview of the relationship that existed between the State and the Church\r\nin Italy one can easily understand that there could be reasons for\r\napprehension, as well as deep interest in the results of the Conclave.\r\nThe eyes of all the Catholic world were turned toward Rome. Great\r\nvexations stirred all the European chanceries; secret influences were\r\npenetrating deep places; they were trying to suppress and overpower\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nSpectators and diplomats of every country in the world were spell\r\nbound by the complexities at the very moment that preparations for\r\nthe Conclave were being made, when all Rome was getting ready to wait\r\npatiently in the Plaza of St. Peter’s during the balloting.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in Italy there arose a debate on the political effects of\r\nBenedict XV. Various prophecies were made as to his successor; the\r\njournalistic row that went on had never been surpassed. Many problems\r\nof vast consequences were superficially treated.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Bonomi ministry, attributed to inefficiency in domestic\r\npolitics and to the fall of the Banca Italiana di Sconto, was really\r\ndue to the failure of a commemoration for Pope Benedict XV from the\r\nnational parliament.\r\n\r\nI had already on various occasions disclosed to the Fascisti, whom I\r\nconsidered and consider always the aristocracy of Italy, that our\r\nreligious ideal had in itself moral attributes of first importance. I\r\nhad affirmed the necessity of condemning the unfruitful conception,\r\nabsurd and artificial, of affected or vicious anti-clericalism.\r\nThat tendency not only kept us in a situation of moral inferiority\r\nas compared with other peoples, but also divided the Italians in\r\nthe religious field into various schools of thought. Above all it\r\nexposed us to such corrupting, sinister and tortuous power as that of\r\ninternational Masonry of a political type, as distinguished from the\r\nMasonry known in the Anglo-Saxon countries.\r\n\r\nI had wanted to show that the problem of the relations between the\r\nState and the Church in Italy was not to be considered insoluble, and\r\nto explain how necessary it was to create, after a calm and impartial\r\nobjective examination, an atmosphere of understanding, in order to give\r\nto the Italian people a basis for a life of harmony between religious\r\nfaith and civil life.\r\n\r\nThe Fascisti, as intelligent people worthy of the epoch in which they\r\nwere living, followed me in the new conception of religious policy. To\r\nit was attached our war against Masonry as we knew Masonry in Italy. It\r\nwas a war of fundamental importance and Fascism was almost unanimous in\r\na determination to fight it to the end.\r\n\r\nLet us not forget that the Masons of Italy have always represented a\r\ndistortion, not only in political life, but in spiritual concepts.\r\nAll the strength of Masonry was directed against the papal policies,\r\nbut this struggle represented no real and profound ideal. The secret\r\nsociety from a practical point of view rested on an association\r\nof mutual adulation, of reciprocal aid, of pernicious nepotism and\r\nfavoritism. To become powerful and to consummate its underhanded\r\ndealings, Masonry made use of the weaknesses of the Liberal governments\r\nthat succeeded each other in Italy after 1870 to extend its\r\nmachinations in the bureaucracy, in the magistracy, in the field of\r\neducation, and also in the army, so that it could dominate the vital\r\nganglions of the whole nation. Its secret character throughout the\r\ntwentieth century, its mysterious meetings, abhorrent to our beautiful\r\ncommunities with their sunlight and their love of truth, gave to the\r\nsect the character of corruption, a crooked concept of life, without\r\nprogramme, without soul, without moral value.\r\n\r\nMy antipathy for that disgusting form of secret association goes back\r\nto my youth. Long before, at the Socialist congress of Ancona in 1914,\r\nI had presented to my comrades the dilemma: Socialists or Masons?\r\nThat point of view had won a complete triumph, in spite of the strong\r\nopposition of the Mason-socialists.\r\n\r\nLater, in Fascism, I made the same gesture of strength. It took\r\ncourage. I obeyed the positive command of my conscience, and not any\r\nopportunism. My attitude had nothing in common with the anti-Masonic\r\nspirit of the Jesuits. They acted for reasons of defense. After all,\r\ntheir inner organization as a religious society is almost completely\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nFor my direct, methodical and consistent course of policy the hate of\r\nthe Masonic sect persecutes me even now. Masonry of that type has\r\nbeen beaten in Italy, but it operates and conspires behind mask of the\r\ninternational anti-Fascism. It utterly fails to defeat me. It tries to\r\nthrow mud at me, but the insult does not reach its mark. It machinates\r\nplots and crimes, but the hired assassins do not control my destiny.\r\nIt goes gossiping about my weaknesses, and the supposed organic\r\nafflictions of my body, but I am more alive and stronger than ever.\r\n\r\nThis is a war without quarter, a war of which I am a veteran. Every\r\ntime that I have wanted to cauterize difficult situations in Italian\r\npolitical life, every time that I have wanted to give a sincere, frank\r\nand loyal moral rectitude to the personnel in politics, I have always\r\nhad against me our Masonry! But that organization, which in other times\r\nwas very powerful, has been beaten by me. Against me it did not and\r\ncannot win. Italians won this battle for me. They found the cure for\r\nthis leprosy.\r\n\r\nTo-day in Italy we breathe the open air; life is exposed to the light\r\nof day.\r\n\r\nWhen Bonomi fell, the King consulted with many minds. I too was called\r\ntwice to the Quirinal, his official palace, where conferences are held.\r\nObvious reasons of reserve forbid me to make known what I said to the\r\nSovereign. This political crisis took on abnormal aspects. We groped in\r\nthe dark. The number of men in the political field who were fit to fill\r\na minority was very limited. They looked toward Orlando, then toward De\r\nNicola, but nobody wanted to accept the responsibility of forming\r\na ministry under the prevailing conditions. They were obliged to go\r\nback to Bonomi, who fell for the second time on the “via crucis” when\r\nhe presented himself again at the chamber.\r\n\r\nNew consultations and new suggestions were made. Always the same\r\nnames were given: Orlando, De Nicola, Bonomi. The picture presented\r\nthat degree of helplessness which has afflicted so many democracies,\r\nand which has enabled many countries to vie with each other in the\r\nhumiliating and derisive boast that they have had more governments and\r\nministries than years of existence! The requirements for leadership\r\nwere unchanged—the ability to compromise principles and sometimes\r\neven integrity, to barter and negotiate with palavering artistry in\r\nan effort to build another shaky structure which would perpetuate\r\nthe whole depressing system. This system may be dear to the heart of\r\ndoctrinaires. It was quite another affair in practice.\r\n\r\nThe “Popular” or “Catholic” party, following its bad political\r\ninstinct, which caused it to be ultra conservative under cover and\r\nrevolutionary in the street and in parliament, vetoed any return of\r\nGiolitti. The posture of the “popolari” was quite unique. Unfortunately\r\nthey controlled a strong group in the chamber. While they refused to\r\naccept the responsibility of power, they blue-pencilled Giolitti and\r\ndenied support to Bonomi. They rendered the composition of any ministry\r\nwell-nigh impossible even as a makeshift.\r\n\r\nIn spite of repeated consultations the same names always came to\r\nthe surface. It was such a stagnation as comes finally to weak\r\ndemocracies. It was tearing to pieces political logic, common sense,\r\nand, unfortunately, also Italy herself.\r\n\r\nAt last the Facta ministry was formed. This mediocre selection of a\r\nmember of parliament, closely bound to Giolitti, was made as the only\r\nanchor of safety in an absurd extravaganza. Every day we went down one\r\nstep on the stairs of dignity. Nevertheless, because of the conditions,\r\nand because Facta undertook a burden that nobody else wanted, I did\r\nnot hesitate to declare in my paper that the new cabinet, colorless\r\nas it was, might function to some end. I was prepared to say that it\r\ncould represent, if nothing else, a will to go on, at least in the\r\naffairs of ordinary routine administration. It is bad enough to suffer\r\na government which creates nothing; it is even worse to suffer a system\r\nof politics which cannot of itself create even an administration!\r\n\r\nFacta was an old veteran of parliament and I feel sure that he was a\r\ngentleman stamped out by the old die. Respectful of the third rate\r\npolitical morals of the men of his age, he had only one devotion. That\r\nwas for his teacher, Giolitti. Facta had been a discreet Minister of\r\nthe Treasury in other times. He had not, as even his friends admitted,\r\nthe strength and authority needed to draw up a ministry at a serious\r\nmoment. He had to face the gas and smoke of the struggle between\r\nparties, of the pretensions of the “popolari,” of the growing strength\r\nof Fascism, and, finally, a delicate international situation abroad.\r\n\r\nIt was in just such ways that the old “liberal” Italy with its\r\npetty dealing with problems, its little parliamentary pea-shooting, its\r\nunworthy plots in corridor and cloak rooms, ante-rooms and sidewalk\r\ncafes, for puny personal power, its recurring crises, its journalistic\r\nbickerings, was breaking the real Italy. Italy, with its struggling\r\nco-operatives, its inadequate rural banks, its mean and superficial\r\nmeasures of economy, its incapable and improvident charity! Italy, in\r\nits position of humble servant, with napkin on arm to wipe other mouths\r\nat international conferences! Italy, prolific and powerful! Italy, like\r\na mother able to supply, even for foreign ingratitude, laborious sons\r\nto make fruitful other soils, other climates, other cities and other\r\npeoples! Such was her leadership; such was her plight!\r\n\r\nFacta was the man who fully represented that old world. Facta was the\r\nfirst to be surprised that he had suddenly found so many admirers. He\r\noften said that he failed to understand why he should be at the head\r\nof the Italian government. This timid member of parliament forgot\r\nthat all these people around him who gave him by their mouthings a\r\nsensation of strength and influence were only the survivors of an old\r\nLiberal-Democratic world, incapable of living, outdated, shipwrecked,\r\nclinging for safety to the last Liberal planks of compromise.\r\n\r\nBut the powerful machine of Fascism was already in motion. Nobody could\r\nstep into its path to stop it, for it had one aim: to give a government\r\nto Italy.\r\n\r\nIn these days there were some attempts at Fascist secession and schism.\r\nI removed them with a few strokes of the pen and a few measures\r\ntaken within. I was troubled less by mistaken disaffections than by\r\na single grave incident in Fiume. There a renegade Italian, Zanella,\r\nnursed and nourished an ignoble anti-Italian plot. The Fascisti imposed\r\nbanishment upon him. This evil representative of the autonomists and\r\nof the Jugo-Slavs was obliged to leave the unhappy city which without\r\nItaly would never have been able to put its lips to the cup of peace.\r\n\r\nAt this time Charles of Hapsburg died, after having twice tried vainly\r\nto seize again the crown of Saint Stephen. The nemesis of history\r\ncompleted its work and took away from the Hapsburg line the last\r\npossibility of return. In Italian history this reigning house had\r\nrepresented always a most unfortunate influence. It had been invariably\r\nadverse to our solidarity.\r\n\r\nWithout attracting deep attention or intelligent public interest,\r\nliving this way and that, up and down by alternate hopes and crises,\r\noptimisms and weary despairs—came the Conference of Genoa.\r\n\r\nOn the first of that May was celebrated the so-called Festival of\r\nLabor. Unfortunately the only distinctions given this festival were an\r\nincreased outburst of Socialist and Communist attacks and ambushes.\r\nEven the anniversary of the declaration of war, May 24th, was saddened\r\nby blood. Solemn celebrations were held throughout Italy, but in Rome\r\nthe Communists dared to fire at the parade which was doing honor to\r\nEnrico Toti, the Roman who, besides his life, had hurled against the\r\nfugitive enemy also his crutches. One person fell dead and there were\r\ntwenty-four wounded.\r\n\r\nAs if that was not enough the Alliance of Labor, a hybrid\r\ncoalition of all the anti-Fascist groups, proclaimed a general strike.\r\n\r\nIt was too much! There was no sign of any act of energy from the\r\ngovernment. Without hesitation I ordered a general mobilization of\r\nthe Fascisti. I affirmed on my word of honor that we would break the\r\nback of the attempt of the red rabble. “We are sure to smash, _we say\r\ncrush_, this bad beast once for all.”\r\n\r\nConsidering the timid behavior of the middle classes and of the\r\ngovernment, this virile decision, taken after full analysis, with full\r\ndetermination and full responsibility, served as a cold douche for the\r\nsocialists and the reds. The Fascist mobilization came like lightning.\r\n\r\nOn the same day the strike ended.\r\n\r\nWhile the public streets, squares and fields were being put in order\r\nby the energetic intervention of the Fascisti, in the parliament at\r\nMontecitorio the usual intrigues went on. There was oscillation of\r\nplans and programmes. These ranged from proposals of a dictatorship to\r\ncollaboration with the reds! In the general marasmus there came on July\r\n12th a statement from the Minister of the Treasury, Peano, which marked\r\nfor me the maximum of our anxiety.\r\n\r\n_The budget of the nation had a deficit of six billions and a half._ It\r\nwas a terrific figure for Italy. It was a situation impossible for our\r\neconomic structure to bear. To errors in foreign and domestic policy\r\nwas added financial chaos. Minister Facta in record-breaking speed\r\nhad demonstrated his incapacity in every way. I made a speech\r\nin parliament on July 19th, 1922, in which I specifically and flatly\r\nwithdrew from the ministry the votes of the Fascist group. After having\r\ndemonstrated the equivocal position of the Socialists, who wanted to\r\ncollaborate with the government so that they might blackmail it the\r\nbetter, and of the “popolari” who wrongly considered themselves supreme\r\nrulers of the situation, I said these clear and sharp words to the\r\nPremier himself:\r\n\r\n“Honorable Facta, I tell you that your ministry cannot live because\r\nit is unbecoming from every point of view. Your ministry cannot live,\r\nI might better say vegetate, or drag its life along, thanks to the\r\ncharity of all those who sustain you. The traditional rope in the same\r\nmanner sustains the not less traditional hanged. After all, your makers\r\nare there to testify to the character of your ministry; you have been\r\nthe first to be surprised into the presidency of the council.”\r\n\r\nI went on then to examine the disheartening mistakes of the Facta\r\npolicies and I concluded by asserting that Fascism by getting away\r\nfrom the parliamentary majority, had accomplished a “gesture of high\r\npolitical and moral modesty....” “It is impossible to be part of the\r\nmajority,” I added, “and at the same time act outside as Fascism is now\r\nforced to act.”\r\n\r\nThese words excited a brisk stir of mumbles, exclamations, and\r\ncomments, which went to a higher pitch when I added:\r\n\r\n“Fascism will make its own decisions. Probably it will soon say if it\r\nwants to become a legitimate party, for that means a government\r\nparty, or if it will instead be a party of insurrection. In the latter\r\ncase it will no longer be able to be part of any governmental majority.\r\nConsequently it will not be obliged to sit in this chamber.”\r\n\r\nI gave in that way, not only to the dying Facta ministry, but also to\r\nany other new government, an energetic and unmistakable warning. I had\r\nput up the signboard of my intentions and declared in the open where I\r\nstood.\r\n\r\nOn that day the Facta ministry fell. And immediately they began to\r\ngrope in the dark again, trying to find a successor. Orlando, Bonomi,\r\nFacta, Giolitti. Again these were the names mouthed about.\r\n\r\nBy process of deductions and eliminations the name finally hit upon\r\nwas Meda. He was the Popular party deputy from Milan, and the chief of\r\nthe “popolari” deputies who with their secret, sinister tactics kept\r\nany ministry under their power. Meda, who had already been a minister,\r\nmade his gesture of refusal and renunciation because of fear. That\r\nwas our paradox—nobody in Italy, amid this so-called strength of the\r\nconstituted order, which included priests and radicals, wanted or was\r\nable to assume responsibility of power. Whatever claims “liberalism”\r\nand “democracy” had for power, now at least nobody would touch the\r\ntreasure.\r\n\r\nIn this situation the socialists cheerfully blackmailed the nation,\r\nwhile the Fascisti were silently preparing the yeast and the bread, the\r\nwill and the weapons for an insurrection of national dignity.\r\n\r\nWhile the conferences to find ways out of the crisis went on\r\nslowly, at the moment of inability to constitute a government there\r\ncame about in Italy an almost inconceivable situation. All the strength\r\nof the left party, not only those openly subversive, but also the\r\norganization of the Labor Confederation, the Socialist parliamentary\r\ngroup, the Democratic groups, and the Republicans, staged a general\r\nstrike all over Italy. Its character was typically and solely\r\nanti-Fascist. Its pretense was to save the liberty of the people,\r\nthreatened by Fascism!\r\n\r\nThis galaxy of political elements, more despicable than riffraff,\r\nthese inert, wasteful, hopeless forces which in the past had massacred\r\nevery liberty and had trampled in every imaginable way on our morals,\r\nour peace, our efficiency, and our order, could not have done a more\r\nillogical, a more unjust, a more offensive and provocative act toward\r\nFascism and the Italian people.\r\n\r\nThe days marked by these sinister forces were days in which I made\r\nirrevocable decisions. Our development brought by degrees a political\r\nand a military reserve strength, which was to bring us in the end to\r\nthe March on Rome and the conquest of power.\r\n\r\nAs an answer to the anti-Fascist provocation, I ordered another general\r\nmobilization of the Fascisti. The council of the “Fasci Italiani di\r\ncombattimento” was ordered to sit permanently. The Fascist technicians\r\nwere to be brought together to continue the work in the public\r\nservices. The “squadristi” were to disperse subversive organizations.\r\nThe Fascisti of Milan assaulted the _Avanti_, which was considered\r\nthe lair of our opponents. They burned the offices. They occupied the\r\nstreet-car barns. They began to make the public services operative in\r\nspite of the declared strike.\r\n\r\nTo crush a strike the government was powerless, but a new strength had\r\nbeen substituted for the government! The Fascisti, well armed, occupied\r\nthe electric stations in order to prevent acts of sabotage. It was\r\nnecessary to destroy forever all the nerve centres of disorder. The\r\nFascisti did it.\r\n\r\nIn Milan alone three young black shirts lost their lives. Of these, two\r\nwere university students. We had many wounded boys.\r\n\r\nThe trial of strength, however, was successful. The enemies of Italy\r\nwere taken with convulsions. They tossed responsibilities back and\r\nforth in foolish oratorical and literary battles. The life of the\r\npeople had come back to a normal rhythm. Fascism had revealed a\r\nprofound strength, one able to dominate our Italy of to-morrow, not only\r\nin the sense of mere force, but in determination, fundamental wisdom,\r\ncharacter and unselfish patriotism.\r\n\r\nOur antagonists were defeated, confused and humiliated. One of those\r\nwho called themselves interpreters of the liberal idea recognized—how\r\ngenerous!—that Fascism was now a power which could not be neglected.\r\nThe _Corriere della Sera_, the serious and in some ways admirable Milan\r\nnewspaper—which had always used its circulation to become the speaking\r\ntrumpet for the spirit of moribund, middle class mediocrity—had given,\r\nin the past, a sort of halo to Filippo Turati, the Socialist\r\nleader. Now it felt that it was necessary to give a bit of space to\r\nrecognize the right of Fascism to participation in the government. The\r\nunsettled crisis went lumbering along. I was again called by the King.\r\nI had some interviews with Orlando. One after another all the projected\r\ncombinations fell apart and were put aside like old rejected castings.\r\nSo, wearily, they came back to Facta. He sent one of his emissaries to\r\nme and asked me under what conditions the Fascisti would accept places\r\nin the new government. I sent back word by the messenger that Fascism\r\nwould ask for the most important offices.\r\n\r\nI was urged to take a position in the Cabinet, but how absurd!\r\nNaturally I had to stay out of the coalition so that I could maintain\r\nmy freedom to criticise, and if need be to take action. My claims,\r\nhowever, for Fascist representation were judged immoderate. The\r\nill-starred Facta ministry was launched without us, but as the ship\r\ntook the water the nation’s sole greeting was a mutter of contempt and\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\nFriends and enemies both looked only toward Fascism. It was the one\r\nelement that sparked interest in the life of the Italian people.\r\n\r\nI had made up my mind to lead the black shirts myself. I already had\r\ncrystallized my determination to march on Rome.\r\n\r\nThe situation admitted of no other solution.\r\n\r\nI called to Milan on October 16th a general who had special fitness\r\nand who was saturated by real Fascist faith. I made a scheme\r\nof military and political organization on the model of the old\r\nRoman legions. The Fascisti were divided by me into “principi” and\r\n“triari.” We created, after conferring with the high leaders, a\r\nslogan, a uniform, and a watchword. I knew perfectly the Fascist\r\nand anti-Fascist situation in every region of Italy. I could march\r\non Rome along the Tyrrhenian sea, deviating toward Umbria. From the\r\nsouth the compact formations of Puglie and Naples could join me. The\r\nonly obstacle was a hostile zone, which centred in Ancona. I called\r\nArpinati and other lieutenants of Fascism and ordered them to free\r\nAncona from social-communist domination. The town, which was known to\r\nbe in the hands of the anarchists, was conquered by maneuvres carried\r\nout in perfect military fashion. There were some dead and wounded. Too\r\nbad! But now the remnants of the anti-Fascist forces were destroyed.\r\nAnti-Fascism was now concentrated in Rome; it was driven back to its\r\nbarrack on Montecitorio, where parliament sat.\r\n\r\nA new sunshine broke over the multitudes of our provinces. We could all\r\nbreathe with full lungs. The brave effort of Fascism was now rising\r\nwith the flood tide of its full efficiency. Critics of reputation,\r\nhistorians of wide-world fame, studious people from every part of the\r\nearth were beginning to regard with quickening interest the movement I\r\nhad created and dominated and was leading toward victory.\r\n\r\nWhile I was penning some editorials against representatives of the\r\nsceptics, I wrote: “Fascism is to-day in the first stage of its\r\nlife: the one of Christ. Don’t be in a hurry; the one of Saint Paul\r\nwill come.”\r\n\r\nI was preparing then every minute the details of the conquest of Rome\r\nand of power. I was certainly not moved by any mirage of personal\r\npower, nor by any other allurement, nor by a desire for egotistical\r\npolitical domination.\r\n\r\nI have always had a vision of life which was altruistic. I have groped\r\nin the dark of theories, but I groped not to relieve myself, but to\r\nbring something to others. I have fought, but not for my advantage,\r\nindirect or immediate. I have aimed for the supreme advantages of my\r\nnation. I desired finally that Fascism should rule Italy for her glory\r\nand her good fortune.\r\n\r\nI cannot, for obvious reasons, discuss all the measures, even some of\r\nthe most simple, that I took in this period. Some are of political\r\nand secret character about which reserve is absolutely necessary. The\r\n_Popolo d’Italia_, my paper, without attracting too much attention\r\nfrom outsiders and from my enemies, had become the headquarters of the\r\nspiritual and material preparation for the March on Rome. It was the\r\nhub of our thought and action. The military and the political forces\r\nboth obeyed my command. I weighed all the plans and proposals. Having\r\nmade my own plan at last I gave the necessary orders. Then there began\r\nextensive preparatory maneuvres, such as the occupation of Trento, of\r\nAncona and of Bolzano—places which might threaten our strategy.\r\n\r\nI wanted to inform myself about the state of mind of the Fascisti,\r\nabout their efficiency and their determination. Accordingly I went to\r\nmake four important speeches in different parts of Italy. In those\r\nspeeches I set forth the policies of to-morrow. I defined the ultimate\r\ngoal of Fascism. It was candidly stated. It was the conquest of power.\r\nI didn’t want to ingratiate myself with the masses. I have always\r\nspoken with naked candor and even with brutality to the multitudes.\r\nThat is a distinct contrast to the contemptible courtship made for\r\ntheir favor by the political parties of every time and every land.\r\n\r\nOn September 17th, 1922, for instance, one month before the March on\r\nRome, I wrote that it was necessary to “throw down, from the altars\r\nerected by the ‘Demos,’ His Holiness _the Mass_!”\r\n\r\nThe Fascisti meetings which I attended were held in Udine, which is\r\nin northern Italy, in Cremona, which lies in the valley of the Po,\r\nin industrial Milan and in Naples, the centre of southern Italy. I\r\nwanted to be personally acquainted with the spirit of those districts,\r\neach with a nobility of its own. I was acclaimed as a conqueror and a\r\nsaviour. This flattered me, but be sure that it did not make me proud.\r\nI felt stronger, and yet realized the more that I faced mountains of\r\nresponsibility. In those four cities, so different and so far one from\r\nthe other, I saw the same light! I had with me the honest, the good,\r\nthe pure, the sincere soul of the Italian people!\r\n\r\nI assembled the Central Committee of the Fasci Italian! di\r\nCombattimento—the Bundles of Fight—and we came to an accord on\r\nthe outlines of the movement, which was to lead the black shirts\r\ntriumphantly along the sacred roads to Rome.\r\n\r\nSpeaking in those days at the Circolo Sciesa of Milan I said to my\r\ntrusted men that we finally had come to the “sad sunset of Liberalism,\r\nand to the Fascist-dawn of a new Italy.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                           THUS WE TOOK ROME\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now we were on the eve of the historic march on the Eternal City.\r\n\r\nHaving completed my survey and estimate of conditions in the provinces,\r\nhaving listened to the reports of the various chiefs of the black\r\nshirts, having selected the plans of action and having determined\r\nin a general way upon the most favorable moment, I called together\r\nin Florence the chiefs of the Fascist movement and of the squads of\r\naction. There were Michele Bianchi, De Bono, Italo Balbo, Giuriati,\r\nand various others. Some one at that quiet conference suggested the\r\nmobilization of the black shirts for November 4th, the anniversary of\r\nthe Victory. I rejected that proposal, for it would have spoiled a day\r\nof commemoration by introducing the element of revolutionary activity.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to give our movement the full advantage of opportunity\r\nand to make it spark and detonate. It was necessary to weigh, besides\r\nthe military aspects, the political effects and values. We had to\r\nconsider, finally, the painful possibility of a violent suppression, or\r\na failure spreading from some slip to all of our plans. We were obliged\r\nto determine beforehand all the hows and whens, the details of the\r\nmeans, with what men and with what aims the Fascist assault could most\r\nwisely be launched.\r\n\r\nThe Fascist meeting in Naples, which was advertised as our second great\r\ncongress, with its display of discipline and of speech-making, served\r\nto hide the beginnings of the real mobilization. At a fixed moment\r\nthe squads of action of all Italy were to be in arms. They would have\r\nto occupy the vital nerve centres—the cities, and the post offices,\r\nthe prefectures, police headquarters, railroad stations, and military\r\nbarracks.\r\n\r\nDetachments of Fascisti were to march along the Tyrrhenian Sea, toward\r\nRome, led by chiefs, all of them brave former officers. The same\r\nmovement was to take place on the Adriatic side, from which direction\r\nwas to be launched on Rome the strength of the low Romagna, Marche and\r\nAbruzzi districts. That plan required that we should free Ancona from\r\nthe social-communist dominion. This had been done. From middle Italy\r\nthe squadrons already mobilized for the meeting at Naples were also to\r\nbe directed upon Rome. They were supported by groups of Fascist cavalry\r\nunder the command of Caradonna.\r\n\r\nThe moment the Fascist mobilization and campaign was decided and\r\nactually began operation, martial law, the stern rules and orders of\r\nFascism both for officers and privates, were to be enforced.\r\n\r\nThe political powers of our “National Directorate” were turned over\r\nto a military quadrumvirate of action in the persons of Generals De\r\nBono, De Vecchi, Italo Balbo and Michele Bianchi. I presided over\r\nthe quadrumvirate and I was the Duce (the leader) and had the ultimate\r\nresponsibility for the work of the four men—a responsibility for which\r\nI was fully pledged not only to the Fascisti but to Italy.\r\n\r\nWe selected as general concentration headquarters the town of Perugia,\r\ncapital of Umbria, where many roads flow to a centre and from which\r\nit is easy to reach Rome. In case of military and political failure\r\nwe could, by crossing the Appennine range, retire to the Valley of\r\nthe Po. In any revolutionary movement of history that zone has always\r\nbeen properly considered the keystone of any situation. There our\r\ndomination was absolute and undisputed. We selected the watchword; we\r\nfixed the details of the action. Everything had to be reported to me—in\r\nthe offices of the _Popolo d’Italia_. Trusted Fascist messengers wove\r\nwebs like scurrying spiders. All day long I was issuing the necessary\r\norders. I wrote the proclamation which was to be addressed to the\r\ncountry on the eve of action. We knew from very faithful unforgettable\r\nfriends that the army, unless exceptional circumstances arose, would\r\nmaintain itself on a ground of amiable neutrality.\r\n\r\nAt the historic congress at Naples, after my opening speech, which\r\ntraced the outlines of the Fascist action in the state and assigned to\r\nNaples the title “Queen of the Mediterranean,” the general discussion\r\ncontinued in academic tone, without a definite aim except that of\r\ngaining time. The leader in that dissembling and sham discussion was\r\nMichele Bianchi, one of the quadrumvirate for the march on Rome.\r\nAt that time he had already revealed a notable political mind. De Bono\r\nand Balbo, who had great authority over the squadrons of action, joined\r\nthe general headquarters in Perugia.\r\n\r\nI went from the adjourned congress back to Milan. During the trip I had\r\nan opportunity to see many friends and to make additional preparations.\r\nI had important conversations regarding that particular drive which had\r\nto be organized in Milan, as in other centres of the Lombardy district.\r\nIn order not to arouse the suspicion of the police, for I was always\r\nsurrounded by spies, I assumed the attitude of an indifferent person\r\nwithout a worry or trouble in the world. This was somewhat difficult,\r\nfor I had to spend precious time in trying the speed of a new car,\r\nand in other workaday comings and goings. In the evenings I went to\r\nthe theatres. I pretended to have a great spirit of activity in my\r\neditorial writing and newspaper management.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly, when I knew that everything was ready, I issued from\r\nMilan, through the _Popolo d’Italia_, by means of independent\r\npublications, and through the correspondents of all the Italian\r\nnewspapers, my proclamation of revolution. It had been signed by the\r\nquadrumvirate. Here is the text of the memorable document:\r\n\r\n “Fascisti! Italians!\r\n\r\n “The time for determined battle has come! Four years ago at this\r\n season the national army loosed the final offensive which brought it\r\n to Victory. To-day the army of the black shirts again takes possession\r\n of that Victory, which has been mutilated, and, going directly to\r\n Rome, brings Victory again to the glory of that Capitol. From now\r\n on ‘principi’ and ‘triari’ are mobilized. The martial law of Fascism\r\n now becomes a fact. By order of the Duce all the military, political\r\n and administrative functions of the party management are taken over by\r\n a secret Quadrumvirate of Action with dictatorial powers.\r\n\r\n “The army, the reserve and safeguard of the Nation, must not take\r\n part in this struggle. Fascism renews its highest homage given to the\r\n Army of Vittorio Veneto. Fascism, furthermore, does not march against\r\n the police, but against a political class both cowardly and imbecile,\r\n which in four long years has not been able to give a Government to the\r\n Nation. Those who form the productive class must know that Fascism\r\n wants to impose nothing more than order and discipline upon the Nation\r\n and to help to raise the strength which will renew progress and\r\n prosperity. The people who work in the fields and in the factories,\r\n those who work in the railroads or in offices, have nothing to fear\r\n from the Fascist Government. Their just rights will be protected. We\r\n will even be generous with unarmed adversaries.\r\n\r\n “Fascism draws its sword to cut the multiple Gordian knots which\r\n tie and burden Italian life. We call God and the spirit of our five\r\n hundred thousand dead to witness that only one impulse sends us on,\r\n that only one passion burns within us—the impulse and the passion to\r\n contribute to the safety and greatness of our Country.\r\n\r\n “Fascisti of all Italy!\r\n\r\n “Stretch forth like Romans your spirits and your sinews! We must win.\r\n We will.\r\n\r\n “Long live Italy! Long live Fascism!\r\n\r\n “The Quadrumvirate.”\r\n\r\nAt night there reached me the first news of bloody clashes in Cremona,\r\nAlessandri and Bologna, and of the assaults on munition factories and\r\nupon military barracks. I had composed my proclamation in a very short\r\nand resounding form; it had impressed the whole of the Italian\r\npeople. Our life was suddenly brought into an ardent atmosphere of\r\nrevolution. News of the struggles that were taking place in the various\r\ncities, sometimes exaggerated by the imaginations of reporters, gave a\r\ndramatic touch to the revolution. Responsible elements of the country\r\nasserted that as a result of this movement there would at last be a\r\ngovernment able to rule and to command respect. The great mass of the\r\npopulation, however, looked out astonished, as it were, from their\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nNone of the subversive or liberal chiefs showed himself. All went into\r\ntheir holes, inspired only by fear. They understood quite thoroughly\r\nthat this was the striking of our hour. Every one felt sure that the\r\nstruggle of Fascism would have a victorious outcome. I could sense this\r\neven from far away. The air was full of it. The wind spoke of it. The\r\nrain brought it down. The earth drank it in.\r\n\r\nI put on the black shirt. I barricaded the _Popolo d’Italia_. In the\r\nlivid and gray morning Milan had a new and fantastic appearance. Pauses\r\nand sudden silences gave one the sensation of certain great hours that\r\ncome and go in the course of history.\r\n\r\nFrowning battalions of Royal Guards scouted the city and the monotonous\r\nrhythm of their feet sounded ominous echoes in the almost deserted\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nThe public services functioned on a reduced and meagre scale. The\r\nassaults of the Fascisti against the barracks and on the post offices\r\nwere cause for fusillades of shots, which gave to the city a\r\nsinister echo of civil war.\r\n\r\nI had provided the offices of my newspaper with everything needful\r\nfor defense against attack. I knew that if the government authorities\r\ndesired to give a proof of their strength they would have directed\r\ntheir first violent assault at the _Popolo d’Italia_. In fact, in the\r\nearly hours of the morning, I saw trained upon the offices and upon me\r\nthe ugly muzzles of the mitrailleuses. There was a rapid exchange of\r\nshots. I had my rifle charged and went down to defend the doors. The\r\nneighbors had barricaded entrances and windows and were begging for\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nDuring the firing bullets whistled around my ears.\r\n\r\nA major of the Royal Guard finally asked for a truce in order to\r\ntalk with me. After a brief initial conversation, we agreed that the\r\nRoyal Guard should withdraw as far as two hundred metres and that the\r\nmitrailleuses were to be removed from the middle of the street and\r\nplaced at a crossing of the street, about a hundred metres away. With\r\nthat sort of armistice began for me the day of October 28th!\r\n\r\nAt night a group of deputies, senators, and political men of Milan, the\r\nbest-known and most responsible figures of the Lombard parliamentary\r\nworld—among whom were senators Conti, Crespi and the deputy De\r\nCapitani—came to the offices of the _Popolo d’Italia_ to ask me to\r\ndesist from a struggle which they asserted would be the beginning of a\r\nviolent, grave and reprehensible civil war. They proposed to me a sort\r\nof armistice and a truce with the central government. Perhaps a\r\nministerial crisis might save, they said, the situation and the country.\r\n\r\nI smiled back at the parliamentarians because of their innocence. I\r\nanswered them in words like these:\r\n\r\n“Dear sirs, there is not the slightest question of any partial or total\r\ncrisis or of substitution of one ministry for another. The game I have\r\nundertaken has a wider and more serious character. For three years we\r\nhave lived in a caldron boiling with small battles and devastations.\r\nThis time I will not lay down weapons until a full victory is\r\nconcluded. It is time to change the direction not only of the\r\ngovernment, but also of the whole of Italian life. There is no question\r\nof a struggle of parties in parliament, but here is a question—we want\r\nto know if we Italians are able to live an autonomous life or are to be\r\nslaves of our own weakness, not only toward foreign nations, but also\r\nin our own affairs? War is declared! We will carry it to the bitter\r\nend. Do you see these communications? Well, the struggle is blazing all\r\nover Italy. Youth is in arms. I am rated as a leader who precedes and\r\nnot one who follows. I will not humiliate with arbitration this page of\r\nthe marvellous resurrection of Italian youth. I tell you that it is the\r\nlast chapter. It will fulfil the traditions of our country. It cannot\r\ndie in a compromise.”\r\n\r\nI then showed my visitors a letter, which I had received at dawn from\r\nCommander Gabriele d’Annunzio. I had sent a brief message to the\r\nredeemer of Fiume, who had been with us since the first moments of the\r\ndarkest struggle. It was brought to him by the Generals Giampietro\r\nand Douhet, and Eugenio Coselschi. D’Annunzio, toward whom some vague\r\nhopes of the politicians had vainly turned, had immediately answered in\r\nthese terms:\r\n\r\n “Dear Mussolini:\r\n\r\n “I received to-night the three messengers, after a hard day of work.\r\n\r\n “In this book, so many times interrupted, are gathered the truths that\r\n the one-eyed man discovers in retirement and meditation. I think that\r\n Italian youth must now recognize them and follow them with purified\r\n heart.\r\n\r\n “It is necessary to gather together all the sincere forces and start\r\n them toward the great goals that are fixed for Italy by her eternal\r\n destinies.\r\n\r\n “From virile patience and not from restless impatience will salvation\r\n come to us.\r\n\r\n “The messengers will tell you my thoughts and my intentions, free from\r\n all vague colorings.\r\n\r\n “The King knows that I am still the most faithful and eager soldier of\r\n Italy.\r\n\r\n “Let him stand against the adverse destinies, which must be faced and\r\n defeated.\r\n\r\n “Victory has the light eyes of Pallas.\r\n\r\n “Do not blindfold her.\r\n\r\n “_Sine strage vincit,_\r\n\r\n “_Strepitu sine ullo._\r\n\r\n “Gabriele d Annunzio.”\r\n\r\nAfter having read the letter of D’Annunzio to these Lombard politicians\r\nI sent them away with the declaration that if I was left with only\r\none man, or indeed all alone, I would not abandon the fight until I\r\nhad obtained the final decisive ends as I had outlined them to my\r\nassociates.\r\n\r\nThe logical clearness, the stout, rigorous, coherent reasons I had\r\ngiven impressed those who had come to offer conciliation, compromise,\r\nconcessions.\r\n\r\nI think that one of them must have immediately sped off to inform the\r\npremier, Facta, that nothing could be done with me.\r\n\r\nPoor Facta, instead of being preoccupied with his shortcomings, was\r\nwondering how and to whom he could announce this real crisis among the\r\nsham crises. The chamber was closed at that time. Where could he turn?\r\n\r\nAny one can see that in all events, even in solemn events, the\r\ngrotesque and the ludicrous are always to be found, and sometimes\r\nprosper under the very shadow of great and tragic happenings.\r\n\r\nThe last of the Liberal governments of Italy wanted to make its final\r\ngesture. It addressed to the country a declaration phrased in the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\n\r\n “Seditious manifestations are appearing in some of the Italian\r\n provinces, brought about in such a way as to hamper the normal\r\n functioning of the powers of the State, and are of such nature as to\r\n throw the Country into serious trouble.\r\n\r\n “The Government has tried its utmost to reach an agreement, with the\r\n hope of bringing back peace to all minds and to assure a peaceful\r\n solution of the crisis. Facing, however, a revolutionary attempt,\r\n it has the duty of maintaining public order by any means and at any\r\n price. Even though its resignations have been presented, it will\r\n fulfil this duty for the safety of citizens and the safety of free\r\n constitutional institutions.\r\n\r\n “Meanwhile the citizens must maintain their calm and must have\r\n faith in the measures of public security that have been adopted.\r\n\r\n “Long live Italy! Long live the King!”\r\n\r\n   “Signed: Facta, Schanzer, Amendola, Taddei, Alessio, Bertone,\r\n       Paratore, Soleri, DeVito, Anile, Riccio, Bertini, Rossi, Dello\r\n       Sbarba, Fulci, Luciani.”\r\n\r\nAt the same time the ministers, considering the situation created in\r\nthe country, put their portfolios at the disposition of the president\r\nof the council, Facta. This man sought advice from several friends in\r\nRome. As a result he offered a decree to proclaim martial law, which\r\nthe King, in his profound wisdom, flatly refused to sign.\r\n\r\nThe Sovereign understood that the revolution of the black shirts\r\nwas the conclusion of three years of struggle and of fighting; he\r\nunderstood that only with the victory of one party could we reach\r\npacification and that order and progress in civil life which are\r\nessential to the harmony of the Italian people.\r\n\r\nOut of respect for the most orthodox constitutional forms, the King\r\nallowed Facta to follow the rules of the Constitution. We had then\r\nresignations, designations, consultations, communications, charges, and\r\nso on and so on. At this moment came a sinister maneuvre that impressed\r\nme as being ominous. The National party of the right, which had a\r\ngreat similarity of outlook with the Fascisti, although it had not the\r\nsame system of campaign, advanced some singular claims by means of\r\nemissaries.\r\n\r\nThe National right asserted in fact that it was the keystone of\r\nthe situation. Salandra, who was the most typical representative of the\r\ngroup, was disposed to sacrifice himself and to take upon his back the\r\ncross of power. This was to be understood as an aid for the Fascisti.\r\nI protested energetically against such a solution, which would have\r\nperpetuated compromise and error. Fascism was under arms, it was\r\ndominating the centres of national life, it had a very well-defined\r\naim, it had followed deliberately an extra-parliamentary path and it\r\ncould not allow its victory to be mutilated or adulterated in such a\r\nmanner. That was my exact answer to the mediators of the union between\r\nthe National right and Fascism. No compromise!\r\n\r\nThe struggle continued with the objectives I had mapped out. It is\r\nimpossible in the pages of an autobiography to present the entire\r\npicture of the revolutionary events in those days. I distinctly\r\nremember that with every hour that passed I had more poignantly the\r\nsensation of triumphantly dominating the Italian political situation.\r\nThe adversaries were confused, scattered, speechless. The Fascisti in\r\ncompact files were already near the gates of Rome and were expecting me\r\nto go to the head of their military formations to march with them into\r\nthe Capital.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 29th I received a very urgent telephone\r\ncall from Rome on behalf of the Quirinal. General Cittadini, first\r\naide-de-camp of His Majesty the King, asked me very kindly to go to\r\nRome because the King, having examined the situation, wanted to charge\r\nme with forming a ministry. I thanked General Cittadini for\r\nhis kindness, but I asked him to give me the same communication by\r\ntelegram. One knows that the telephone may play dirty tricks at times.\r\nGeneral Cittadini, after having first objected that my request was not\r\nusual under the Court regulations, took into consideration the abnormal\r\nand informal situation, and agreed to send me the same invitation by\r\ntelegram. In fact after a few hours an urgent message arrived. It was\r\nof a personal character.\r\n\r\nThis was it:\r\n\r\n “On. Mussolini, Milan,\r\n\r\n “His Majesty the King asks you to come immediately to Rome for he\r\n wishes to offer you the responsibility of forming a Ministry. With\r\n respect,\r\n\r\n “General Cittadini.”\r\n\r\nThis was not yet victory, but the progress made was considerable.\r\nI communicated directly with the headquarters of the revolution in\r\nPerugia and with the various commands of the black shirts in Milan. I\r\ngave out, by means of an extra edition of the _Popolo d’Italia_, the\r\nnews of the command I had received.\r\n\r\nI was in a terrible state of nervous tension. Night after night I had\r\nbeen kept awake, giving orders, following the compact columns of the\r\nFascisti, restricting the battle to the knightly practices of Fascism.\r\n\r\nA period of greater responsibilities was about to begin for me; I must\r\nnot fail in my duty or in my aims. I gathered all my strength to my\r\naid, I invoked the memory of the dead, I asked the assistance of God,\r\nI called upon the faithful living to assist me in the great task\r\nthat confronted me.\r\n\r\nThat night of October 31st, 1922, I left the direction of the _Popolo\r\nd’Italia_ and turned my fighting journal over to my brother, Arnaldo.\r\nIn the number of November 1st I published the following declaration:\r\n\r\n “From now on the direction of the _Popolo d’Italia_ is intrusted to\r\n Arnaldo Mussolini.\r\n\r\n “I thank and salute with brotherly love all the editors,\r\n collaborators, correspondents, employees, workers, all those who have\r\n assiduously and faithfully labored with me for the life of this paper\r\n and for love of our Country.\r\n\r\n “Rome, October 30th, 1922.\r\n\r\n “Mussolini.”\r\n\r\nI parted with regret from the paper that had been the most constant and\r\npotent factor in our victory. I must add that my brother, Arnaldo, has\r\nbeen able to maintain the editorship with dignity and capacity.\r\n\r\nWhen I had intrusted the paper to my brother I was off for Rome. To\r\nthe zealous people who wanted to get me a special train to go to Rome\r\nto confer with the King, I said that for me a compartment in the\r\nusual train was quite enough. Engines and coal should not be wasted.\r\nEconomize! That is the first and acid test of a true man of government.\r\nAnd after all I could only enter Rome at the head of my black shirts,\r\nthen camping at Santa Marinella in the atmosphere and the shining rays\r\nof the Capital.\r\n\r\nThe news of my departure sped all over Italy. In every station where\r\nthe train stopped I found a gathering of the Fascisti and of the masses\r\nwho wanted to bring me, even through the pouring rain, their\r\ncheers and their good-will.\r\n\r\nLeaving Milan was painful. That city had given me a home for ten years;\r\nto me it had been prodigal in the satisfaction it had afforded; it had\r\nsupported me in every stress; it had baptized the most wonderful squads\r\nof action of Fascism; it had been the scene of historical political\r\nstruggles. Now I was leaving it, called by destiny and by a greater\r\ntask. All Milan knew of my going, and I felt that even in the feeling\r\nof joy for a departure that was a symbol of victory, there was also a\r\nshade of sadness.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the hour for sentimentality. It was the time for\r\nquick, sure decisions. After the kisses and farewells of my family I\r\nsaid good-by to many prominent Milanese, and then I went away, speeding\r\ninto the night, to take counsel with myself, to refresh my soul, to\r\nlisten to the echoes of voices of friends and to envisage the wide\r\nhorizons of to-morrow’s possibilities.\r\n\r\nThe minor episodes of that trip and of those days are not important.\r\nThe train brought me into the midst of the Fascisti; I was in view of\r\nRome at Santa Marinella. I reviewed the columns. I established the\r\nformalities for the entrance into Rome. I established connections\r\nbetween the quadrumvirate and the authorities.\r\n\r\nMy presence redoubled the great enthusiasm. I read in the eyes of those\r\nyoung men the divine smile of triumph of an ideal. With such support I\r\nwould have felt inspired to challenge, if need be, not only the base\r\nItalian ruling class, but enemies of any sort and race.\r\n\r\nIn Rome an indescribable welcome awaited me. I did not want\r\nany delay. Even before making contacts with my political friends\r\nI motored to the Quirinal. I wore a black shirt. I was introduced\r\nwithout formalities into the presence of His Majesty the King. The\r\nStefani agency and the great newspapers of the world gave stilted\r\nor speculative details about this interview. I will limit myself,\r\nfor obvious reasons of reserve, to declare that the conference was\r\ncharacterized by great cordiality. I concealed no plans, nor did I fail\r\nto make plain my ideas of how to rule Italy. I obtained the Sovereign’s\r\napprobation. I took up lodgings at the Savoy Hotel and began to work.\r\nFirst I made arrangements with the general command of the army to bring\r\nmilitia into Rome and to have them defile in proper formation in a\r\nreview before the King. I gave detailed and precise orders. One hundred\r\nthousand black shirts paraded in perfect order before the Sovereign.\r\nThey brought to him the homage of Fascist Italy!\r\n\r\nI was then triumphant and in Rome! I killed at once all unnecessary\r\ndemonstrations in my honor. I gave orders that not a single parade\r\nshould take place without the permission of the General Fascist\r\nCommand. It was necessary to give to everybody from the first moment a\r\nstern and rigid sense of discipline in line with the régime that I had\r\nconceived.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  _From a photograph by Strazza._\r\n  King Victor Emmanuel III and Mussolini.\r\n  ]\r\n\r\nI discouraged every manifestation on the part of army officers who\r\nwanted to bring me their plaudits. I have always considered the army\r\noutside and above every kind of politics. The army must, in my opinion,\r\nbe inspired by absolute and conscientious discipline; it must\r\ndevote itself, with the deepest will, only to the defense of frontiers\r\nand of historical rights. The army is an institution which must be\r\npreserved inviolate. It must not suffer the slightest loss in its\r\nintegrity and in its high dedication.\r\n\r\nBut other and more complex problems surged about me at that moment. I\r\nwas in Rome not only with the duty of composing a new ministry; I had\r\nalso firmly decided to renew and rebuild from the very bottom the life\r\nof the Italian people. I vowed to myself that I would impel it toward\r\nhigher and more brilliant aims.\r\n\r\nRome sharpened my sense of dedication. The Eternal City, “caput\r\nmundi,” has two Courts and two Diplomacies. It has seen in the\r\ncourse of centuries imperial armies defeated under its walls. It has\r\nwitnessed the decay of the strong, and the rise of universal waves of\r\ncivilization and of thought. Rome, the coveted goal of princes and\r\nleaders, the universal city, heir to the old Empire and the power of\r\nChristianity! Rome welcomed me as leader of national legions, as a\r\nrepresentative, not of a party or a group, but of a great faith and of\r\nan entire people.\r\n\r\nI had long meditated my action as a man of party and as a man of\r\ngovernment. I had carried these thoughts as I walked by day and even as\r\nI slept by night. I had won and could win more. I could have nailed my\r\nenemies to the wall, not only metaphorically but in very fact if I had\r\nwished—those enemies who had slandered Fascism and those whom I hated\r\nfor having betrayed Italy in peace as they had betrayed her in war.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere was pregnant with the possibility of tragedy. I had\r\nmobilized three hundred thousand black shirts. They were waiting for my\r\nsignal to move. They could be used for one purpose or another. I had\r\nin the Capital sixty thousand armed men ready for action. The March on\r\nRome could have set tragic fires. It might have spilled much blood if\r\nit had followed the example of ancient and modern revolutions. This was\r\nfor me a moment in which it was more necessary than ever to examine the\r\nfield with calm serenity and with cold reason to compare the immediate\r\nand the distant results of our daring action when directed toward\r\ndefinite aims.\r\n\r\nI could have proclaimed a dictatorship, I could have formed a\r\ndictatorial ministry composed solely of Fascisti on the type of the\r\nDirectory that was formed in France at the time of the Convention. The\r\nFascist revolution, however, had its unique characteristics; it had\r\nno antecedent in history. It was different from any other revolution\r\nalso in its capacity to re-enter, with ♦deliberate intent, legal,\r\nestablished traditions and forms. For that reason also, I knew that the\r\nmobilization should last the shortest possible time.\r\n\r\n♦ “deliberaate” replaced with “deliberate”\r\n\r\nI did not forget that I had a parliament on my hands; a chamber\r\nof deputies of sullen mind, ready to lay traps for me, accustomed\r\nto an old tradition of ambiguity and intrigue, full of grudges,\r\nrepressed only by fear; a dismayed senate from which I could obtain a\r\ndisciplined respect but not an eager and productive collaboration.\r\nThe Crown was looking on to see what I would do, following\r\nconstitutional rules.\r\n\r\nThe Pontificate followed the events with anxiety. The other nations\r\nlooked at the revolution suspiciously if not with hostility.\r\nForeign banks were anxious for news. Exchange wavered, credit was\r\nstill vacillating, waiting for the situation to be cleared. It was\r\nindispensable first of all to give the impression of stability to the\r\nnew régime.\r\n\r\nI had to see, oversee and foresee everything. I slept not at all for\r\nsome nights, but they were nights fecund in action and ideas. The\r\nmeasures that immediately followed in the first twenty-four hours of my\r\ngovernment bear witness.\r\n\r\nAnother problem arose from the character of the revolution. Every\r\nrevolution has in it, besides the great mass of human impact and the\r\nconscientious and unselfish leaders, two other types—adventurers\r\nand melancholic intellectuals who might be called, by a synthetic\r\nexpression, ascetics of revolution. When the revolution is over,\r\nthe mass, which often is moved by the simple intuition of a great\r\nhistorical and social reality, goes peacefully back to its usual\r\nactivities. It forms the laborious and disciplined leaven of the new\r\nrégime. The conscientious and unselfish leaders form the necessary\r\naristocracy of rulers. But the ascetics and the adventurers are a dead\r\nburden. The first would like to see overnight a perfect humanity,\r\nwithout faults. They do not understand that there is no revolution that\r\ncan change the nature of men. Because of their Utopian illusions\r\nthe ascetics are never contented; they waste their time and other men’s\r\nenergies in sophistry and doubts just when it is necessary to work like\r\nfiends in order to go forward. The adventurers always identify the\r\nfortune of the revolution with their own fortune; they hope to gain\r\npersonal advantage from the victory and they harbor resentment when\r\ntheir wishes are not satisfied, and clamor for extreme and dangerous\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nNow I had to defend the Fascist victory from the ascetics and the\r\nadventurers. The adventurers, however, sank rapidly in the Fascist\r\nrevolution, because it was different and on a higher plane than any\r\nother revolution.\r\n\r\nBut I felt it my constant duty to examine and to ponder, in such a\r\ngrave moment, every step I made.\r\n\r\nFirst of all in the pressure of events, I desired to assure regularity\r\nto the country and to constitute a new government. Order came quickly.\r\nThere were only a few sporadic incidents of violence, inevitable under\r\nsuch conditions. I felt the necessity of safeguarding Facta, and I\r\ncalled ten black shirts who had each been much decorated for bravery\r\nfor the purpose of accompanying Facta to Pinerolo, his native town,\r\nunder their word of honor. They kept their promise. “Nobody”—that was\r\nthe order—“should touch a hair, mock or humiliate Facta.” He had given\r\nto the country his only son, who died in an airplane accident during\r\nthe war, and Facta deserved respect for that and more.\r\n\r\nI forbade reprisals against the leaders of the oppositions. It\r\nwas only by my great authority that I averted the destruction, not\r\nonly rhetorical but also actual, of my most rabid enemies. I saved\r\ntheir skins for them. At the same time, in the space of a few hours,\r\nI constituted a new ministry. I discarded, as I said, the idea of a\r\nFascist dictatorship, because I wanted to give to the country the\r\nimpression of a normal life free from the selfish exclusiveness\r\nof a party. That sense of instinct for equilibrium accompanies me\r\nfortunately in the gravest, the most strenuous, and the most critical\r\nmoments. I decided then, after having weighed everything, to compose a\r\nministry of a nationalist character.\r\n\r\nI have had the feeling, as I had then, that later there would become\r\ninevitable a process of clarification; but I preferred that it should\r\ncome forth spontaneously from the succeeding political events.\r\n\r\nBut that was the last generous gesture that I ever made toward the old\r\nItalian ring of parties and politicians.\r\n\r\nIn the new ministry, among ministers and undersecretaries of state,\r\nwere fifteen Fascisti, three Nationalists, three Liberals of the right,\r\nsix “Popolari” and three Social Democrats. I was generous toward the\r\nLiberals of the right, whose peculiar maneuvre in order, to pick up\r\nfor their profit the results of the Fascist revolution had been quite\r\nrecent. Among the “Popolari” and Social Democrats I selected those\r\nwho gave promise of national spirit and who did not intrigue with\r\nsubversive popularism or with socialism.\r\n\r\nI kept for myself, with the Presidency of the Council, the office\r\nof the Interior and assumed ad interim that of Foreign Affairs. I gave\r\nto Armando Diaz the Ministry of War and I promised to give him an army\r\nworthy of the country and the victor of Vittorio Veneto. I called\r\nAdmiral Thaon de Revel for the Navy and Federzoni for the Colonies.\r\n\r\nThe complete formation of the ministry was as follows:\r\n\r\n  Benito Mussolini, Deputy, _Presidency of the Council, Domestic and\r\n    “interim” of Foreign Affairs_ (Fascist).\r\n\r\n  Armando Diaz, General of the Army, _War_.\r\n\r\n  Paolo Thaon de Revel, Admiral, Senator, _Navy_.\r\n\r\n  Luigi Federzoni, Deputy, _Colonies_ (Nationalist).\r\n\r\n  Aldo Oviglio, Deputy, _Justice_ (Fascist).\r\n\r\n  Alberto De Stefani, Deputy, _Finances_ (Fascist).\r\n\r\n  Vincenzo Tangorra, Deputy, _Treasury_ (“Popolare”).\r\n\r\n  Giovanni Gentile, Professor, _Public Instruction_ (Liberal of the\r\n    Right).\r\n\r\n  Gabriello Carnazza, Deputy, _Public Works_ (Democrat).\r\n\r\n  Giuseppe DeCapitani, Deputy, _Agriculture_ (Liberal of the Right).\r\n\r\n  Teofilo Rossi, Senator, _Industry and Commerce_ (Democrat).\r\n\r\n  Stefano Cavazzoni, Deputy, _Work and Social Providence_ (“Popolare”).\r\n\r\n  Giovanni Colonna di Cesaro’, Deputy, _Posts and Telegraphs_ (Social\r\n    Democrat).\r\n\r\n  Giovanni Giuriati, Deputy, _Liberated Provinces_ (Fascist).\r\n\r\n                  _Under Secretaries of State_\r\n\r\n  _Presidency_: Giacomo Acerbo, Deputy (Fascist).\r\n\r\n  _Domestic_: Aldo Finzi, Deputy (Fascist).\r\n\r\n  _Foreign_: Ernesto Vassallo, Deputy (“Popolare”).\r\n\r\n  _War_: Carlo Bonardi, Deputy (Social Democrat).\r\n\r\n  _Navy_: Costanzo Ciano, Deputy (Fascist). _With the Commisariat of\r\n    Commercial Marine._\r\n\r\n  _Treasury_: Alfredo Rocco, Deputy (Nationalist).\r\n\r\n  _Military Assistance_: Cesare Maria De Vecchi, Deputy (Fascist).\r\n\r\n  _Finances_: Pietro Lissia, Deputy (Social Democrat).\r\n\r\n  _Colonies_: Giovanni Marchi, Deputy (Liberal of the Right).\r\n\r\n  _Liberated Provinces_: Umberto Merlin, Deputy (“Popolare”).\r\n\r\n  _Justice_: Fulvio Milani, Deputy (“Popolare”).\r\n\r\n  _Instruction_: Dario Lupi, Deputy (Fascist).\r\n\r\n  _Fine Arts_: Luigi Siciliani, Deputy (Nationalist).\r\n\r\n  _Agriculture_: Ottavio Corgini, Deputy (Fascist).\r\n\r\n  _Public Works_: Alessandro Sardi, Deputy (Fascist).\r\n\r\n  _Post and Telegraph_: Michele Terzaghi, Deputy (Fascist).\r\n\r\n  _Industry and Commerce_: Gronchi Giovanni, Deputy\r\n    (“Popolare”).\r\n\r\n  _Labor and Social Providence_: Silvio Gai, Deputy (Fascist).\r\n\r\nWhen the ministry was completed I wrote the following paper of\r\ndemobilization, signed by the quadrumvirate:\r\n\r\n “Fascisti of all Italy!\r\n\r\n “Our movement has been rewarded by Victory. The leader of our party\r\n has assumed the political powers of the State, both for domestic\r\n and for foreign affairs. Our Government, while it consecrates our\r\n triumph with the names of those who were its creators on land and sea,\r\n assembles, with the purpose of national pacification, men from the\r\n other parties, because they are attached to the cause of the Nation.\r\n\r\n “The Italian Fascism is too intelligent to desire a greater\r\n victory.\r\n\r\n “Fascisti!\r\n\r\n “The supreme quadrumvirate of action, turning back its powers to the\r\n direction of the party, salutes you for your marvellous proof of\r\n courage and discipline. You have shown your merit in the future of the\r\n country.\r\n\r\n “Disperse in the same perfect order in which you gathered for the\r\n great trial, destined—we firmly believe—to open a new epoch in Italian\r\n history. Go back to your usual work, because Italy now needs to work\r\n peacefully to reach its better day.\r\n\r\n “Nothing must trouble the powerful stride of the Victory that we won\r\n in these days of proud passion and sovereign magnitude.\r\n\r\n “Long live Italy. Long live Fascism!\r\n\r\n “The Quadrumvirate.”\r\n\r\nThen I sent a telegram to D’Annunzio and I distributed an energetic\r\ncircular to all the Prefects of the Kingdom and to the lesser\r\nauthorities. The telegram to D’Annunzio said:\r\n\r\n “Assuming the hard task of giving discipline and internal peace to the\r\n Nation, I send to you, Commander, my affectionate greetings for you\r\n and for the destinies of the country. The valiant Fascist youth which\r\n gives back a soul to the Nation will not blindfold Victory. Mussolini.”\r\n\r\nThe text of the circular sent to office-holders was the following:\r\n\r\n “From to-day, intrusted with the confidence of His Majesty the King,\r\n I undertake the direction of the Government of the Country. I demand\r\n that all authorities, from the highest to the least, discharge\r\n their duties with intelligence and with complete regard for the\r\n supreme interests of the Country.\r\n\r\n “I will set the example.\r\n\r\n “The President of the Council and Ministry of the Interior. Signed:\r\n Mussolini.”\r\n\r\nFinally I announced for November the 16th a meeting of the chamber of\r\ndeputies, to render an account of what I had done, and to announce my\r\nintentions and programme.\r\n\r\nIt was an exceptional meeting. The hall was filled to overflowing.\r\nEvery deputy was present. My declarations were brief, clear, energetic.\r\nI left no misunderstanding. I stated sharply the rights of revolution.\r\nI called the attention of the audience to the fact that only by the\r\nwill of Fascism had the revolution remained within the boundaries of\r\nlegality and tolerance.\r\n\r\n“I could have made,” I said, “of this dull and gray hall a bivouac\r\nfor corpses. I could have nailed up the doors of parliament and have\r\nestablished an exclusively Fascist government. I could have done those\r\nthings, but—at least for a time—I did not do them.”\r\n\r\nI then thanked all my collaborators and pointed with sympathy to the\r\nmultitude of Italian laborers who had aided the Fascist movement with\r\ntheir active or passive solidarity.\r\n\r\nI did not present one of the usual programmes that the past ministries\r\nused to present; for these solved the problems of the country only\r\non paper. I asserted my will to act and to act without delaying for\r\nuseless oratory. In the field of foreign politics I squarely\r\ndeclared the intention of following a “policy of dignity and national\r\nutility.”\r\n\r\nOn every subject I made weighty declarations that showed how Fascism\r\nhad already been able to assay and analyze and solve varying and urgent\r\nproblems, and to fix the future outlines of government. Finally I\r\nconcluded:\r\n\r\n “Gentlemen:\r\n\r\n “From further communications you will know the Fascist programme\r\n in its details. I do not want, so long as I can avoid it, to rule\r\n against the Chamber; but the Chamber must feel its own position.\r\n That position opens the possibility that it may be dissolved in two\r\n days or in two years. We ask full powers because we want to assume\r\n full responsibility. Without full powers you know very well that we\r\n couldn’t save one lira—I say one lira. We do not want to exclude the\r\n possibility of voluntary co-operation, for we will cordially accept\r\n it, if it comes from deputies, senators, or even from competent\r\n private citizens. Every one of us has a religious sense of our\r\n difficult task. The Country cheers us and waits. We will give it not\r\n words but facts. We formally and solemnly promise to restore the\r\n budget to health. And we will restore it. We want to make a foreign\r\n policy of peace, but at the same time one of dignity and steadiness.\r\n We will do it. We intend to give the Nation a discipline. We will\r\n give it. Let none of our enemies of yesterday, of to-day, of to-morrow\r\n cherish illusions in regard to our permanence in power. Foolish and\r\n childish illusions, like those of yesterday!\r\n\r\n “Our Government has a formidable foundation in the conscience of the\r\n Nation. It is supported by the best, the newest Italian generations.\r\n There is no doubt that in these last years a great step toward\r\n the unification of spirit has been made. The Fatherland has again\r\n found itself bound together from north to south, from the continent\r\n to the generous islands, which will never be forgotten, from\r\n the metropolis of the active colonies of the Mediterranean and the\r\n Atlantic Ocean. Do not, Gentlemen, address more vain words to the\r\n Nation. Fifty-two applications to speak upon my message to Parliament\r\n are too many. Let us, instead of talking, work with pure heart and\r\n ready mind to assure the prosperity and the greatness of the Country.\r\n\r\n “May God assist me in bringing to a triumphant end my hard labor.”\r\n\r\nI do not believe that, since 1870, the hall of Montecitoro had heard\r\nenergetic and clear words. They burned with a passion deep in my being.\r\nIn that speech there was the essence of my old and my recent wrestling\r\nwith my own mind and my own soul. More than one deputy had to repress\r\nthe rancour generated by my deserved reproaches; but my exposition\r\nin parliament was rewarded by the approval of the whole of Italy. I\r\nwas looking beyond that old hall of parties of petty power and of\r\npoliticians. I was speaking to the entire nation. It listened to me and\r\nit understood me!\r\n\r\nMy political instinct told me that from that moment there would\r\nrise, with increasing truth and with increasing expansion of Fascist\r\nactivity, the dawn of new history for Italy.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps dawn on a new path of civilization....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                       FIVE YEARS OF GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nMy revolutionary method and the power of the Black Shirts had brought\r\nme to tremendous responsibility of power. My task, as I have pointed\r\nout, was neither simple nor easy; it required large vision, it gathered\r\nto it continually more and more duties.\r\n\r\nAn existence wholly new began for me. To speak about it makes it\r\nnecessary for me to abandon the usual form of autobiographic style; I\r\nmust consider the organic whole of my governmental activity. From now\r\non my life identifies itself almost exclusively with thousands of acts\r\nof government. Individuality disappears. Instead, my person expresses,\r\nI sometimes feel, only measures and acts of concrete character; these\r\ndo not concern a single person; they concern the multitudes, they\r\nconcern and permeate an entire people. So one’s entire life is lost in\r\nthe whole.\r\n\r\nCertainly I know that I took the direction of the government when\r\nthe central power of the state was sinking to the bottom. We had a\r\nfinancial situation that Peano of the Liberal party had summarized\r\nwith an astounding figure: six billions of deficit! Individually the\r\npeople fed on expedients. Progressive inflation and the printing\r\npresses gave to everybody the old illusion of prosperity. It created\r\nan unstable delusion of well-being; it excited a fictitious game of\r\ninterests. All this had to be expiated when faced by the severe Fascist\r\nfinancial policy.\r\n\r\nAbroad our political reputation had diminished progressively. We were\r\njudged as a nation without order and discipline, unable either to\r\nprosper or produce. The chronic infection of disorder had withdrawn\r\nfrom us the sympathies of countries better equipped than we were. Worse\r\nyet, it had increased the haughtiness and the contempt of many of our\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nThe Italian school system, in its complex formation, university, middle\r\nand lower schools, had turned its energies into purely abstract,\r\ntheoretical functions; it had withdrawn more and more from a real\r\nworld, a modern world, and from the fundamental problems of national\r\nlife; it had been inert as a guide to civil duties. Schools and pulpits\r\nshould always show the way to ascending peoples.\r\n\r\nThere still lived, in the national mechanism, strange and hateful\r\nregional political formations; these used to bring our solidarity into\r\nquestion, if not into peril. The activities of the government in terms\r\nof services, improvements and appropriations were guided and affected,\r\nnot by real natural necessities, but by the desire to ingratiate this\r\nor that population, or region. The treasury was tapped by this base\r\npolicy of politics—electoral strategy.\r\n\r\nA bureaucracy already suffering from elephantiasis increased its\r\ndistention, generating that spirit of trouble, those characters of\r\ninstability, of intolerance, of slight love of duty, which are typical\r\nof all great accumulations of functionaries, especially when the latter\r\nare not well paid, and do not see their moral prestige supported\r\nand built up by the authority of the state and by precise and clear\r\ndefinition of individual responsibility.\r\n\r\nWe still had, as a consequence of our generous struggle, the Fascist\r\nsquadron formations. They might become, in the new conditions of life,\r\na danger threatening public order and legality.\r\n\r\nThe army and the navy lived apart from the great problems of national\r\nlife. As a matter of fact, though this is good in many respects, it is\r\nnot good when they are set aside in an almost humiliated formation.\r\nAviation was in disorder. It was difficult to give it new strength. One\r\nmust not forget, when considering aviation, that Nitti had forbidden\r\nflight, not only for military planes, but also for private planes. His\r\ncommand was to demobilize aviation, and to sell the motors as well as\r\nthe airplanes. It was a kind of premeditated murder of a nation which\r\nreally did not want to be strangled.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime there assembled in Rome all the arms and legs of\r\nanti-Fascism, in all its gradations. The political parties, at first\r\ndismayed by the revolution of the Black Shirts and my advent to power,\r\nbegan to revive. They began to find courage to pursue again the\r\ngeneral trend of political parties in the equivocal atmosphere of the\r\nparliamentary corridors at Montecitorio. The Italian press was,\r\nfor the greater part, tied to old groups and to old political customers.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to reorganize all civil life, without forgetting the\r\nbasic need of a supervisory force. It was necessary to give order\r\nto political economy, to the schools, to our military strength. It\r\nwas necessary to abolish double functions, to reduce bureaucracy, to\r\nimprove public services. It was necessary to check the corrosion and\r\nerosion of criticism by the remnants of the old political parties. I\r\nhad to fight external attacks. I had to refine and improve Fascism. I\r\nhad to divide and floor the enemies. I saw the vision that I must in\r\nevery respect work to improve and to give tone to all the manners and\r\ncustoms of Italian political life.\r\n\r\nIt was also imperative not to neglect the ten millions of Italians\r\nemigrated beyond the frontiers. We had to give faith again to the zones\r\non our borders. We had to assist in bringing modern improvements and\r\nstimuli to the life of the southern regions, and to get in touch with\r\nall the men of the healthy and strong provinces, wherever they were.\r\n\r\nInfinite then were the problems and the worries. I had to decide\r\neverything, and I had a will firm enough to summon up all the political\r\npostulates that I had enunciated and sustained with pen and paper, in\r\nmeetings and in my parliamentary speeches. This was not only a problem\r\nof strength to last, to endure, to stand erect in any wind, but also,\r\nabove all, a problem of will.\r\n\r\nI abandoned everything that kept me tied to the fortunes of my\r\nnewspapers; I parted from everything that could have the slightest\r\npersonal character. I devoted myself wholly, completely, exclusively,\r\nto the work of reconstruction.\r\n\r\nTo-day there is no change. I want to be a simple, devoted servant\r\nof the state; chief of a party, but, first, worthy head of a strong\r\ngovernment. I abandoned without regret all the superfluous comforts of\r\nlife. I made an exception only of sports which, while making my body\r\nalert and ready, succeed in creating healthy and happy intervals in my\r\ncomplex life of work. In these six years—with the exception of official\r\ndinners—I have never passed the threshold of an aristocrat’s salon, or\r\nof a cafe. I have also almost entirely abandoned the theatre, which\r\nonce took away from me useful hours of evening work.\r\n\r\nI love all sports; I drive a motor car with confidence; I have done\r\ntours at great speed, amazing not only to my friends, but also to old\r\nand experienced drivers. I love the airplane; I have flown countless\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nEven when I was kept busy by the cares of power, I needed only a few\r\nlessons to obtain a pilot’s license. I once fell from a height of fifty\r\nmetres, but that did not stop my flying. Motors give me a new and\r\ngreat sensation of strength. A horseback ride on a magnificent sorrel\r\nis also for me a joyous interruption, and fencing, to which I devote\r\nmyself, often with remarkable physical benefit, gives me the greatest\r\nsatisfaction. I ask of my violin nothing more than serene hours of\r\nmusic. Of the great poets, such as Dante, of the supreme philosophers,\r\nsuch as Plato, I often ask hours of poetry, hours of meditation.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  Mussolini walking along the seashore, May 1, 1928.\r\n  From a photograph presented to Mr. Richard Washburn Child.\r\n  ]\r\n\r\nNo other amusement interests me. I do not drink, I do not smoke,\r\nand I am not interested in cards or games. I pity those who lose time,\r\nmoney, and sometimes all of life itself in the frenzy of games.\r\n\r\nAs for the love of the table; I don’t appreciate it. I do not feel it.\r\nEspecially in these last years my meals are as frugal as those of a\r\npauper. In every hour of my life, it is the spiritual element which\r\nleads me on. Money has no lure for me. The only things at which I aim\r\nare those which identify themselves with the greatest objects of life\r\nand civilization, with the highest interests, and the real and deep\r\naspirations of my country. I am sure of my strength and my faith; for\r\nthat reason I do not indulge in any concession or any compromise. I\r\nleave, without a look over my shoulder, my foes and those who cannot\r\novertake me. I leave them with their political dreams. I leave them to\r\ntheir strength for oratorical and demagogic exertion.\r\n\r\nItaly needed what? An avenger! Her political and spiritual resurrection\r\nneeded a worthy interpreter. It was necessary to cauterize the virulent\r\nwounds, to have strength, and to be able to go against the current. It\r\nwas necessary to eliminate evils which threatened to become chronic.\r\nIt was necessary to curb political dissolution. I had to bring to the\r\nblood stream of national life a new, serene and powerful lymph of the\r\nItalian people.\r\n\r\nVoting was reduced to a childish game; it had already humiliated the\r\nnation for entire decades. It had created a perilous structure far\r\nbelow the heights of the duties of any new Italy. I faced numberless\r\nenemies. I created new ones—I had few illusions about that! The\r\nstruggle, in my opinion, had to have a final character: it had to be\r\nfought as a whole over the most diverse fields of action.\r\n\r\nTo express this character of completeness of the whole struggle, I must\r\nbe able to set it forth in a clear, evident way; it is necessary for\r\nme to set forth in subdivisions the different fields in which action\r\nwas demanded of me and out of which evolved the most significant facts\r\nof my governmental life. Deeds and actions, more than any useless\r\nsubjective expressions, write my true autobiography—from 1922 till 1927.\r\n\r\nI never had any interval of uncertainty; fortunately, I never knew\r\nthose discouragements or those exaltations which often are harmful\r\nto the effectiveness of a statesman. I understood that not only my\r\nprestige was at stake, but the prestige, the very name of the country\r\nwhich I love more than myself, more than anything else.\r\n\r\nI was anxious to improve, refine and co-ordinate the character of\r\nthe Italians. Let me state what my domestic policies have been,\r\nwhat was charted and what was achieved. From petty discords and\r\nquarrels of holiday and Sunday frequency, from many-colored political\r\npartisanships, from peasant strifes, from bloody struggles, from the\r\ninsincerity and duplicity of the press; from parliamentary battles\r\nand maneuvres, from the vicissitudes of representative lobbies, from\r\nhateful and useless debates and snarling talk, we finally climbed up\r\nto the plane of a unified nation, to a powerful harmony—dominated,\r\ninspired and spiritualised by Fascism. That is not my judgment, but\r\nthat of the world.\r\n\r\nAfter my speech of November 16th, 1922, in the chamber of\r\ndeputies, I obtained approval for my declaration by 306 votes against\r\n116. I asked and without difficulty obtained full powers.\r\n\r\nI issued a decree of amnesty which created an atmosphere of peace. I\r\nhad to solve the problem of our armed Fascist squadrons. I always have\r\nhad great influence with my soldiers and with the action squads, which\r\nin every part of Italy had given proof of their valor, their gallantry,\r\nand their passionate faith. But now that Fascism had reached power,\r\nthese formations were, in such a situation, no longer desirable.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I could not suddenly wipe out or simply direct\r\ntoward the fields of sport these groups of men who had for me a deep,\r\nblind, and absolute devotion. In their instinct, in their vibrant\r\nconviction, they were led not only by strength and courage, but by\r\na sense of political virtue. And as the perils had not entirely\r\ndisappeared, it was imperative to guard the citadel of the Black\r\nShirt’s triumph. I decided then to create a Voluntary Militia for\r\nNational Security and Defence. Of course its duties had to be well\r\ndefined. It must be commanded by seasoned veterans and chiefs who,\r\nafter having fought the war, had known and experienced the struggles of\r\nthe Fascist resurrection.\r\n\r\nI proclaimed that with Fascism at the wheel everything illegal and\r\ndisorderly must disappear. The decision to transform the squads of\r\naction to Voluntary Militia for National Security undoubtedly was one\r\nof political wisdom; it conferred on the régime not only authority, but\r\nalso a great reserve strength.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the Grand Council, a body exquisitely\r\npolitical, was one of my major aims after my coming to power. I faced\r\nthe necessity of creating a political organization typically Fascist,\r\none which would be outside and above the various old political\r\nmechanisms dominating and misruling our national life. Every day I\r\nneeded clear answers to questions arising—I needed a body of reference.\r\nIn all my complex work as chief of the government, I could not forget\r\nthat I was also chief of the party that for three years had fought in\r\nthe squares and streets of Italy—not merely to gain power, but above\r\nall to meet the supreme task and the supreme necessity of infusing a\r\nnew spirit into the nation.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Council had to be the propelling element of Fascism, with\r\nthe hard and delicate task of preparing and transforming into legal\r\nenactments the work of the Fascist revolution. There were no—and there\r\nare none now—heterogeneous elements in the Grand Council, but virile\r\nFascists, ministers, representatives of our deepest currents of public\r\nopinion, men of expert knowledge and of interests. The Grand Council\r\nhas always succeeded. I preside over it, and let me add, as a detail,\r\nthat all the motions and the official reports which have appeared in\r\nthe papers in concise form, have been written by my hand. They are the\r\nproduct of long meditations in which Italian life and the position of\r\nItaly in the world have been examined and dissected by the Fascist\r\nsoul, spirit and faith. The Grand Council, which to-day I want framed\r\nin the legislative institutions of the régime, has rendered in its\r\nfirst five years a magnificent, unparallelled service.\r\n\r\nOne of the problems which presented itself first of all was that of\r\nthe unification of the police forces. We had the ordinary police, with\r\nthe different branches of political and judiciary police; the Royal\r\nCarabinieri, and, finally, the body of the Royal Guards. This last\r\ninstitution, created by Nitti, was made up of demobilized elements\r\nand was a useless organization finding its place somewhere between\r\nthe carabinieri and the usual forces of public security. I decided\r\nimmediately to suppress the Royal Guards. That suppression in the\r\nmain was not attended by unfortunate incidents. In some cities, such\r\nas Torino and Milano, there were riots and attempts at resistance.\r\nI gave severe orders. I called into my office or telephoned to the\r\nchiefs responsible for certain local situations. I ordered them to\r\nfire, if necessary. In six hours everything was calm again. The instant\r\ndissolving of an armed body of forty thousand men cost only four dead\r\nand some tens of wounded. The officers were incorporated into other\r\norganizations, or took up activities according to their own wishes; the\r\nprivates reached their districts and homes without further trouble.\r\n\r\nOur Italian form of political Masonry, which at first had seemed to\r\nhave adjusted itself to the new conditions, submitting to the advent\r\nof Fascism to power, now began a stupid and deceitful warfare against\r\nme and against Fascism. In a meeting of the Grand Council I proclaimed\r\nthe impossibility for Fascisti of membership at the same time in\r\nMasonry. As a leader of the ranks of socialism I had already pursued\r\nthe same anti-Masonic policy. We must not forget that this shady\r\ninstitution with its secret nature has always had in Italy a character\r\ntypical of the briber and blackmailer. It has nothing of protection,\r\nhumanitarianism, benevolence. Every one, even those who were benefited,\r\nare convinced that Italian Masonry has been nothing more than a society\r\nfor mutual aid and for reciprocal adulation of its members. Every one\r\nknows that it has diffused in every way a worship of self-interest, and\r\nmethods of privilege and intrigue, neglecting and despising rights and\r\nprerogatives of intelligence and morality. My struggle against Masonry\r\nwas bitter; I carry the tangible signs of it still, but it constitutes\r\nfor me, for my sincerity, and my probity, one of the most precious\r\ntitles of merit.\r\n\r\nIn 1923, after negotiations carried on with unwavering constancy,\r\nI united Italian Nationalism with Fascism. For a certain time an\r\nidentical vision had been shared by these two organizations about\r\neverything concerning the ends and aims of our national life. Political\r\ndevelopments, however, had led them along separate paths. Now that\r\nvictory had been concluded and the better elements of Nationalism\r\nwere already collaborating with the new régime, the unification was\r\nmore than a wise move; it was also an act of political sincerity.\r\nBlack Shirt and Blue Shirt—the latter was the uniform of the\r\nNationalists—united in a perfect accord of chivalry and political\r\nloyalty. This new and deep unity permitted us to enjoy the\r\nprospect of more favorable auspices for a new future, one worthy of\r\nthat great Italy which had been prophesied, desired and finally created\r\nby Nationalism and Fascism.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1923, in Turin, there assembled the national congress of\r\nthe “Popular Party.” It was a verbose and academic meeting, not very\r\ndifferent from the other political congresses that for decades had\r\nhypnotized Italian public life. They naturally discussed the policies\r\nof the Fascist régime for a long while and, after various divergencies\r\nof opinion, the majority of those assembled voted in favor of a\r\nmiddle-ground position with an anti-Fascist leaning.\r\n\r\nAmong the members of my ministry there were some of the “Popular\r\nParty”; they found themselves, after the meeting, in a difficult and\r\ndelicate situation. I naturally put before them the problem of giving\r\nthought to their opportunity of staying in the Fascist government in\r\nthe new state of things created by the attitude of their party. There\r\nwere some explanations. Differing opinions alternated, but, in order to\r\ninitiate that process of political clarification that I had foreseen\r\nas inevitable, I advised the members of the government of the Popular\r\nparty to give up their places so that they could avoid dissensions\r\nbetween their parliamentary group and the Fascist party.\r\n\r\nThis process of clarification I had foreseen as soon as I went into\r\npower. The climate and altitude of Fascism was not adapted to all minds\r\nof that time. There were still many dissenters. Many people fed on the\r\nillusory hope that they would be able to influence and bend the\r\nmethodical and straight courses laid out by Fascism. For this purpose,\r\nI was approached by those who were skilled in twistings, turnings and\r\nslidings. Naturally, they always found me as resistant as flint.\r\n\r\nIn 1923, for the first time, our Labor Day passed without incident;\r\nthe people worked calmly, without regretting that old date which now\r\nin Italy had lost every meaning. Later on I wanted to get in touch\r\nwith the public opinion of Italy and to measure how deep Fascism had\r\npenetrated the masses. First I went to Milan and to Romagna. Afterward\r\nI went to Venice, Padua, Vicenza, Sicily and Sardinia; finally I\r\njourneyed to Piacenza and Florence. I found everywhere warm, vibrant\r\nenthusiasm, not only among my lieutenants and the Black Shirts, but\r\nalso among all of the Italian people. That people finally was sensing\r\nthat it had a government and a leader.\r\n\r\nThe Black Shirts, the makers of the revolution, hailed me as a leader\r\nwith the same changeless enthusiasm they had shown when I was only\r\nthe chief of the party and when I was developing that programme of\r\njournalistic attack which had added so much to my popularity. The\r\nItalian temperament at times is much more adapted to faction than to\r\naction. But now my old comrades were just as near to me in their daily\r\ntasks and their regimental discipline. Their attitude not only made me\r\nproud but moved me deeply. I could not ignore this warm youth so full\r\nof ardor, and I was quite decided not to sacrifice it to compromises\r\nwith an old world which was destined to disappear. The population\r\nfelt that it had recovered a real liberty; they had experienced\r\nliberation from the continuous blackmail of parties which deluded the\r\nmasses. They blessed my political work. And I was happy.\r\n\r\nIt was in this period that the campaign of the opposition opened again.\r\nNot being able to beat me on the field of conciliation and compromise,\r\nthe opposing elements, led by the _Corriere della Sera_, began a series\r\nof depressing prophecies and calamity howling. They launched deceitful\r\nattacks and spun their polemic webs. I put into effect, however, a new\r\nelectoral law, because I did not want to fall into the pitfalls of our\r\nold proportional representative system. I had alienated the “Populars,”\r\nthe Democrats, and some of the Liberals. The reforming of the school,\r\nabout which I will have more to say, had invited some hostilities.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we had anti-Fascist assaults and ambushes. This was a\r\nstormy year. It must be regarded as a period of settling and one\r\nof difficulty. I had to guard Fascism from internal crises, often\r\nprovoked by intrigue and trickery. I succeeded in this by being always\r\ninexorably opposed to those who thought they could create disturbances\r\nand frictions in the party itself. Fascism is a unit; it cannot have\r\nvarying tendencies and trends, as it cannot have two leaders on any\r\none level of organization. There is a hierarchy; the foundation is the\r\nBlack Shirts and on the summit is the Chief, who is only one.\r\n\r\nThat is one of the first sources of my strength; all the dissolutions\r\nof our political parties were always born not from ideal motives\r\nbut from personal ambitions, from false preconceptions or from\r\ncorruption, or from mysterious, oblique and hidden forces which I could\r\nalways identify as the work of our Italian Masonry. I took account\r\nof all this. I resolved not to yield a hairbreadth. When the more\r\nurgent legislative problems had been settled by parliament I decided\r\nto dissolve the chamber, and after having obtained extension of full\r\npowers, I announced elections for April 6th, 1924.\r\n\r\nThis signal for elections was sufficient to calm political agitations\r\nof dubious character. All the parties began their stock-taking and the\r\nrevision of their forces. All got ready to muster the greatest number\r\nof votes and to send to the chamber the greatest possible number of\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\nAn election may be considered a childish play, in which the most\r\nimportant part is played by the elected. The “Honorables,” to be able\r\nto become so, do not overlook any sort of contortion, of demagogy and\r\ncompromise. Fascism did not want to submit to the usual forms of that\r\nsilly farce. We decided to create a large National list on which places\r\nhad to be found not only for known, tried and faithful custodians and\r\ntrustees of Fascism, but also for those who in the active national\r\nlife had been able to uphold the dignity of their country. Fascism by\r\nthis policy gave full proof of great political wisdom and probity. It\r\neven tolerated men of opposing or doubtful position because they could\r\nserve. In the National list were included ex-presidents of the Council,\r\nsuch as Orlando, and of the Chamber, such as De Nicola; but the\r\nmain body of the list was made up of new elements. It was, in fact,\r\ncomposed of two hundred veterans, ten gold medals, one hundred and\r\nfourteen silver medals, ninety-eight bronze medals, eighty mutilated\r\nand war invalids, thirty-four volunteers. The majority of the list was\r\ndrawn from the aristocracy of the war and the victory.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists, divided from the Communists, sharpened their weapons,\r\nand so did the Populars. But from the ballot boxes of April 6th there\r\nflowed a full, irrevocable, decisive victory for the National list. It\r\nobtained five million votes against the two millions represented by all\r\nthe other lists put together. My policy and our régime was supported by\r\nthe people. I then could be indulgent toward our adversaries, instead\r\nof pressing them harder, as I might have done.\r\n\r\nI directed that political battle staying in Milan. I attached no great\r\nimportance to the results of the electoral struggle, but it interested\r\nme as an expression of the support and the enthusiasm which, in every\r\nItalian city, had already been given to the National Fascist list. This\r\nindorsement by the people encouraged my thesis and my governmental\r\nwork. Having gone back to Rome I was received as a returning victor,\r\nand, from the balcony of the Palazzo Chigi, while I saluted the people\r\nand the city of Rome, I congratulated the new and greater Italy, in\r\nwhich men of good faith were all in harmony.\r\n\r\nThis was my synthesis: Let Parties die and the Country be saved.\r\n\r\nOn May 24th, with unusual solemnity, came the opening of\r\nthe Twenty-seventh Legislature. His Majesty the King made a very\r\nimpressive speech. The hall had the appearance of a great occasion.\r\nFor petty political reasons, the elements which denied the country and\r\nbelittled Italian life determined to stay away. The inauguration of\r\nthe Twenty-seventh Legislature, however, did not lose anything in its\r\nfulness and moral value. Particularly well received were the veterans,\r\nsome of whom were very much decorated. Now there stirred, in that old\r\nchamber, so used to mean and petty political intrigues, a breath of\r\nnew life; there was present a heroic sense of the new soul of Italy, a\r\nsense of a living aspiration for greatness.\r\n\r\nAll these things irritated the Socialists. In their hearts they had\r\nhated the war, had debased our victory. The old parliamentary world\r\ncould not adjust itself to this magnificent gathering of youth. The\r\ncongenital cowardliness of Montecitorio, the seat of parliament, would\r\ncertainly refuse homage to the bravery symbolized by these golden\r\nmedals!\r\n\r\nThe deep dissension between the new and the old Italy was revived\r\nagain at Montecitorio. This dissension persisted in the atmosphere of\r\nparliament even after it had been beaten and overcome by Fascism in\r\nthe squares and streets of Italy and in the hearts of the nation. In\r\nthe historic meeting of May 24th, 1924, that sad antipathy was to have\r\nits epilogue. Not by mere chance had I chosen the precise date of our\r\nentrance into the war.\r\n\r\nAfter some days the usual parliamentary discussions began. The\r\nseating of new deputies roused violent diatribes. The Socialists,\r\nwho were absent from the ceremony of May 24th, had again taken up\r\ntheir posts of combat. The atmosphere was red-hot. I knew that it\r\nwould be necessary to give a different tone to all our political\r\nlife, especially to parliamentary life—there was no use my cherishing\r\nillusions about that. With very great patience I succeeded in appeasing\r\nthe first tumultuous meetings. Nothing proved more effective in\r\nelevating the plane of the discussion than a speech delivered on June\r\n6th by the blind veteran, Carlo Delcroix. On June 7th I answered all\r\nthe opponents exhaustively. I denounced their maneuvres. I remember\r\nthat I admonished every one in the name of Fascist martyrdom and in the\r\nname of the peace of souls, to attend solely to productive activities.\r\nI added: “We feel that we represent the Italian people and we declare\r\nthat we have the right to scatter to the winds the ashes of your spites\r\nand of our spites, so that we may feed with powerful lymph, in the\r\ncourse of years and centuries, the venerable and intangible body of the\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\nI felt the necessity of making in parliament a high appeal for calm,\r\nfor a sense of balance and justice. I was animated by a deep and\r\nsincere desire for peace. But the success of my words was apparent\r\nonly; in the ardors of the parliamentary political struggle scenes\r\nunworthy of any assembly took place.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists had been hit in their most sensitive spots; they had\r\nbeen slammed against reality. They were outnumbered, amazed by\r\nthe rush of Italian youth, dismayed by the new direction events were\r\ntaking. All the new political realism was in full antagonism to their\r\nleanings; they were beaten and they felt it. In such a situation, the\r\nSocialists wanted as a last resort to squeeze out some way of avoiding\r\nsurrender, at least, in parliament.\r\n\r\nSkillful and astute in every political art, they protracted without\r\nend all the annoyances they could devise. It was a game played with\r\nthe deliberate aim to destroy and tear down. In this subtle work of\r\nexasperation, Matteotti, the deputy, distinguished himself above all\r\nothers. He was a Socialist from the province of Rovigo, whose arrogant\r\nspirit held tenaciously to the principle of political dissolution.\r\nAs a Socialist he hated war. In this attitude he reached a degree of\r\nabsurdity even beyond that attained by any other Socialist. In the\r\ntragic period after the defeat at Caporetto, he had set himself against\r\nour Venetian refugees. Matteotti denied shelter to those unhappy people\r\nwho fled from the lands then invaded by the enemy and in which the\r\nAustrians were committing every sort of violence. He said that they\r\nought to remain under Austrian domination!\r\n\r\nTo this parliamentary battle of polemics he now brought his whole bag\r\nof tricks and devices. Being a millionaire, he considered socialism as\r\na mere parliamentary formula. It is to be remembered, however, that he\r\nwas an ardent fighter, well able to irritate his adversaries in the\r\nwhirlwind of the struggle, but he was far from being able seriously to\r\nimperil the assembly and to silence such a party as the Fascist.\r\nMatteotti was not a leader. In that same Socialist party there were\r\nindividuals who surpassed him in powers of debate, in talent, and in\r\ncoherence. In his electoral districts he had had violent fights with\r\nthe Fascists, and in the chamber he had at once revealed himself as a\r\nmost zealous and pugnacious opponent.\r\n\r\nOne day Matteotti disappeared from Rome. Immediately it was whispered\r\nabout that a political crime had been committed. The Socialists were\r\nlooking for a martyr who might be of use for purposes of oratory,\r\nand at once, before anything definite could possibly be known, they\r\naccused Fascism. By my orders, we began a most painstaking and complete\r\ninvestigation. The government was determined to act with the greatest\r\nenergy, not only for the sake of justice, but also to stop, from the\r\nvery first moment, the spread of any kind of calumny. I threw the\r\nPrefect and Police Chief of Rome, the Secretary of the Interior, Finzi,\r\nand the Chief of the Press Office, Cesare Rossi, into the task of\r\nclearing up the mystery. Activity on the part of the police for the\r\ndiscovery of the guilty persons was ordered without stint. Very soon\r\nit was possible to identify the guilty. They were of high station.\r\nThey came from the Fascist group, but they were completely outside our\r\nresponsible elements.\r\n\r\nThe sternest proceedings were instituted against them without limit or\r\nreservation. Severe measures were taken—so severe indeed that in some\r\ncases they proved to be excessive.\r\n\r\nThe suspects were arrested at once. Among the responsible\r\nelements, those who had had relations with the guilty ones, merely\r\nbecause they were under suspicion retired, though innocent, from public\r\nlife. No threat of restraint was laid on the authorities, the police\r\nand the courts.\r\n\r\nAll this should have stilled the storm.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary. This dramatic episode was destined to disturb the\r\naustere serenity that I had imposed on myself and on every one, in\r\nthe general policy of the country. Though we were still living in\r\nan atmosphere incandescent with passion, with polemics and violent\r\nbattles, it seemed hardly possible that only a few days after the\r\nopening of the Twenty-seventh Legislature, a group of men of position\r\ncould carry through an enterprise which, begun as a jest, was to\r\nconclude in a tragedy. I always have had harsh and severe words for\r\nwhat happened. But despite the faithful and energetic behavior of the\r\ncentral government, there now burst out an unparalleled offensive\r\nagainst Fascism and against its leader. The opposition in the chamber\r\ngave the first signal of an attack in grand style. I perceived and\r\nforesaw immediately the ignoble game, which grew, not from any love for\r\nthe poor victim, but solely from hate for Fascism. I was not surprised.\r\nIn the chamber, when weak men already were hesitating, I said:\r\n\r\n“If it is a question of lamenting, if it is a question of condemning,\r\nif it is a question of regretting the victim, if it is a question of\r\npressing our prosecution of all the guilty and those responsible, we\r\nhere repeat that this will be done calmly and inexorably. But\r\nif from this very sad happening some one seeks to draw an argument\r\nfor anything but a wider reconciliation of all men on the basis of an\r\naccepted and recognised need of national concord—if any one should\r\ntry to stage upon this tragedy a show of selfish political character\r\nfor the purpose of attacking the government, it must be known that\r\nthe government will defend itself at any cost. The government, with\r\nundisturbed conscience, sure of having already fulfilled its duty and\r\nwilling to do it in the future, will adopt the necessary means to crush\r\na trick which, instead of leading to the harmony of Italians, would\r\ntrouble them with the deepest dissensions and passions.”\r\n\r\nThese words did not penetrate minds already hardened. And there\r\nhappened exactly what I had foreseen; the opposition threw themselves\r\non the corpse of Matteotti in order to poison the political life of\r\nItaly and to cast calumnies on Fascism both in Italy and abroad.\r\n\r\nThe course of Italian public life from June till December, 1924,\r\noffered a spectacle absolutely unparalleled in the political struggle\r\nof any other country. It was a mark of shame and infamy which would\r\ndishonor any political group. The press, the meetings, the subversive\r\nand anti-Fascist parties of every sort, the false intellectuals,\r\nthe defeated candidates, the soft-brained cowards, the rabble, the\r\nparasites, threw themselves like ravens on the corpse. The arrest of\r\nthe guilty was not enough. The discovery of the corpse and the sworn\r\nstatement of surgeons that death had not been due to a crime but\r\nhad been produced by trauma was not enough.\r\n\r\nInstead, the discovery of the corpse in a hedge near Rome, called the\r\nQuartarella, unstopped an orgiastic research into the details which is\r\nremembered by us under the ignominious name of “Quartarellismo.”\r\n\r\nFortunes were built on the Matteotti tragedy; they speculated on\r\nportraits, on medals, on commemorative dates, on electric signs; a\r\nsubscription was opened by subversive newspapers and even now the\r\naccounts are still open.\r\n\r\nThe opposition parties and their representatives in the chamber\r\nretired from Montecitorio and threatened not to participate further in\r\nlegislative work; to this movement and to those who espoused it was\r\ngiven, by false analogy with the well-known event of Roman history,\r\nthe name of Aventino. But the Aventino group was here reduced to a\r\ngrotesque parody, in which hate and nakedness of power now reunited men\r\nof the most diverse political complexions. They ranged all the way from\r\nSocialists to Liberals, from Democrat-Masons to Populars, who pretended\r\nto be called Catholics. Clandestine meetings were held. They abused in\r\nevery way the liberty of the press and of assembly, in order to destroy\r\nItalian life. Fanatical elements waited hour after hour for Fascism\r\nto be overthrown. In the background of this ignoble dramatic farce,\r\nthere stood out the figure of senator Albertini, the happy owner of the\r\nnewspaper. This man was willing to scrape in the garbage, to listen to\r\nall the dirty rogues, to collect the most mendacious pamphlets,\r\ntrying somehow, sometime, somewhere, to hit at me and at Fascism.\r\n\r\nI did not have a moment of doubt or discouragement. I knew the\r\nattitudes, postures and poses of these adversaries. I knew that if they\r\ncould they would have ignobly used the corpse of the Socialist deputy\r\nas an anti-Fascist symbol and flag. But their ghoulish politics passed\r\nthe bounds of my imagination. Besides these speculators, there were\r\nthose on the timid and flabby fringes of Fascism. They let themselves\r\nbe led astray by the political atmosphere. They did not perceive that\r\nan episode is not the stuff of which history should be made. In the\r\nname of a sentimental morality, they were willing to kill a great moral\r\nand political probity and knife the welfare of an entire nation.\r\n\r\nIn this situation there were also many repentant Magdalenes, and many,\r\nimpelled by the sad habit of many Italians to consider as pure gold the\r\nacts and the work of any opposition, hid their Fascist insignia and,\r\ntrembling, abandoned the Fascist nation, already grown red-hot from a\r\nthousand attacks and counter-attacks of its adversaries.\r\n\r\nWe were going back into the depths of a revolutionary period, with\r\nall the excesses of such an abnormal time, all its spites, troubles,\r\nand explosions. An atmosphere was formed in which many magistrates,\r\noften under Masonic influence, could certainly not give equitable and\r\nfaultless judgments. Various parties beyond the borders were giving\r\nhelp to the Socialists at home. It was then clear to what extent\r\nanti-Fascism was still abroad in certain international zones where\r\nDemocracy, Socialism and Liberalism had consolidated their weight of\r\npatronage, blackmail and parasitism.\r\n\r\nAll this might have created for a moment, in certain political\r\natmospheres, the illusion that the government had weakened. In\r\nDecember, 1924, at the end of that painful three months, some were\r\ncalculating the days of life of our ministry. A great hope sprang up in\r\nthe hearts of the politically hungry. There was, in fact, a miserable\r\nmaneuvre on the part of the three former presidents of the council;\r\nthey were able to delude themselves and others. But these professional\r\npolitical men have so little practical sense that they could not\r\nunderstand that with one breath I could have given an order to the\r\nBlack Shirts which would have overturned once and for all their fancies\r\nand their dreams.\r\n\r\nThe swelled frogs waited for their triumph. The corrupt press gave the\r\nmaximum of publicity to the calumnies, to incitation to commit crimes\r\nand to spread defamation. The Crown, supreme element of equilibrium,\r\nwas violently menaced with blackmail and worse. As ever, there were\r\nadventurers who were eager to speculate on any turn in the tide of\r\nevents in order to create again for themselves a political rebirth.\r\nThis base and pernicious crew I, for my part, have always eliminated\r\nfrom the sphere of activity and position controlled by me.\r\n\r\nAs if all this were not enough, in that dark December of 1924, to\r\ncomplete the picture, Cesare Rossi, the former chief of the press\r\noffice, tried a rascally trick. This man, cast out from Fascism\r\nbecause he was implicated in the Matteotti affair, prepared a\r\nmemorial which was a tissue of lies and libels. He aimed to involve\r\nthe régime in guilt, and consequently to involve me. Everything that\r\nhad happened or was happening in Italy he endeavored to put on my\r\ndoorstep. This memorial, written by such a man, pretended to present\r\na “moral indictment” of me. But in that field I cannot be attacked;\r\nevery attempt of this sort is empty. I was informed beforehand of\r\nthe plot that Rossi was going to attempt; I knew the contents of his\r\nmemorial and the day on which it was to be printed in the papers of the\r\nopposition. I put an end to the miserable maneuvre. I published the\r\nmemorial in a friendly paper; in this way I indicated that I gave no\r\nvalue to it. It was a jest and a delusion. The theatrical stroke fell\r\non emptiness; the bubble swelled by slanders flattened like a pricked\r\nballoon.\r\n\r\nThe contemptible game lasted six months. The half-hearted had sunk\r\nbeneath the surface; the singers of the doleful tunes felt their\r\nthroats becoming parched. The speculators were now disgusted with\r\nthemselves. In that period a former minister, decorated with the\r\nCollare dell’Annunziata, the highest order of Italy’s sovereign,\r\nalligned himself with the cult of Republicanism and with the worst\r\nelements of the Socialists!\r\n\r\nI held the Fascist party firmly in my hand during this period. I curbed\r\nthe impulses of some Fascists who wanted violent reprisals with a\r\nclear order: “Hands in the pockets! I am the only one that must have\r\nhis hands free.” In Florence and Bologna, however, there occurred\r\nepisodes of extreme violence. I understood then that it was time to\r\nspeak and act.\r\n\r\nIn all that time I credit myself with the fact that I never lost\r\nmy calm nor my sense of balance and justice. Because of the serene\r\njudgment that I endeavor to summon to guide my every act, I ordered\r\nthe guilty to be arrested. I wanted justice to follow its unwavering\r\ncourse. Now I had fulfilled my task and my duty as a just man. Now\r\nagainst my adversaries I could play my own game—in the open.\r\n\r\nWhen the menace of a general strike in the Province of Rome arose, I\r\nordered the Florentine legions of the Militia to parade in the streets\r\nof the Capital. The armed Militia with its war songs is a great agent\r\nof persuasion. It is an argument. In September, 1924, I had visited\r\nthe most intense zones of the Tuscan Fascism; I went among the strong\r\npopulations of the Amiata, among the workers and peasants, among the\r\nminers of the province of Siena. On that occasion, while opponents\r\nhourly awaited my fall—and that was also the secret hope of many\r\nenemies beyond the borders—I delivered to the Fascists an audacious\r\nsentence in which I sounded an affirmation of strength and victory:\r\n\r\nOf our adversaries, I said, “we will make a litter for the Black\r\nShirts.”\r\n\r\nThe opposition press made a great fuss about these words; but their\r\nchattering had no importance. That became clear on January 3rd,\r\n1925. On that day, when Rome was already full of the exiled from the\r\nprovinces and of those who tremblingly awaited the conclusion\r\nof the political struggle, I made in parliament this speech, which\r\ncertainly was not lacking in reserve:\r\n\r\n Gentlemen,\r\n\r\n The speech I am going to make before you might not be classed as a\r\n parliamentary speech. It may be possible that, at the end, some of you\r\n will find that this speech is tied, even though a space of time has\r\n elapsed, to the one I pronounced in this same hall on November 16th.\r\n Such a speech can lead somewhere, but it cannot lead to a political\r\n vote. In any case let it be known that I am not looking for this vote.\r\n I do not want it; I have had plenty. Article 47 of the Statute says:\r\n “The Chamber of the Deputies has the right to accuse the Ministers\r\n of the King and to bring them to face the High Court of Justice.” I\r\n formally ask if in this Chamber, or outside it, there is any one who\r\n wants to make use of Article 47. My speech will then be very clear;\r\n it will bring about an absolute clarification. You can understand\r\n this. After having marched for a long time with comrades to whom our\r\n gratitude always will go out for what they have done, it is good sense\r\n to stop to consider whether the same route, with the same companions,\r\n could be followed in the future.\r\n\r\n Gentlemen, I am the one who brings forth in this hall the accusations\r\n against me.\r\n\r\n It has been said that I would have founded a “Cheka.”\r\n\r\n Where? When? In what way? Nobody is able to say. Russia has executed\r\n without trial from one hundred and fifty thousand to one hundred and\r\n sixty thousand people, as shown by statistics almost official. There\r\n has been a Cheka in Russia which has exercised terror systematically\r\n over all the middle classes and over the individual members of those\r\n classes, a Cheka which said it was the red sword of revolution. But an\r\n Italian Cheka never has had a shadow of existence.\r\n\r\n Nobody has ever denied that I am possessed of these three\r\n qualities; a discreet intelligence, a lot of courage and an utter\r\n contempt for the lure of money.\r\n\r\n If I had founded a Cheka I would have done it following the lines of\r\n reasoning that I have always used in defending one kind of violence\r\n that can never be eliminated from history.\r\n\r\n I have always said—and those who have always followed me in these\r\n five years of hard struggle can now remember it—that violence, to\r\n be useful in settling anything, must be surgical, intelligent and\r\n chivalrous. Now, all the exploits of any so-called Cheka have always\r\n been unintelligent, passionate and stupid.\r\n\r\n Can you really think that I could order—on the day following the\r\n anniversary of Christ’s birth when all saintly spirits are hovering\r\n near—can you think that I could order an assault at ten o’clock in\r\n the morning in the Via Francesco Crispi, in Rome, after the most\r\n conciliatory speech that I ever made during my Government?\r\n\r\n Please do not think me such an idiot. Would I have planned with the\r\n same lack of intelligence the minor assaults against Misuri and Forni?\r\n You certainly remember my speech of June 7th. It should be easy for\r\n you to go back to that week of ardent political passion when, in this\r\n hall, minority and majority clashed every day, so much so that some\r\n persons despaired of ever being able to re-establish those terms of\r\n political and civil cooperation most necessary between the opposite\r\n parties in the Chamber. The shuttles of violent speeches were flying\r\n from one side to the other. Finally on June 6th Delcroix with his\r\n lyric speech, full of life and passion, broke that storm-charged\r\n tension.\r\n\r\n The next day I spoke to clear the atmosphere. I said to the\r\n opposition, “I recognize your ideal rights, your contingent rights.\r\n You may surpass Fascism with your experience; you may put under\r\n immediate criticism all the measures of the Fascist Government.”\r\n\r\n I remember, and I have still before my eyes the vision of this part\r\n of the Chamber, where all were attentive, where all felt that I had\r\n spoken deep, living words, and that I had established the basis\r\n for that necessary living-together without which it is not possible to\r\n continue even the existence of any political assembly.\r\n\r\n How could I, after a success—let me say that without false or\r\n ridiculous modesty—after a success so clamorous that it was admitted\r\n by all the Chamber, opposition included, a success because of which\r\n the Chamber opened again the next Wednesday in a good atmosphere, how\r\n could I think, without being struck with mad extravagance, to order,\r\n I won’t say a murder, but even the slightest, the most petty offense\r\n against that very adversary whom I esteemed because he had a certain\r\n courage which looked like my courage, and an obstinacy which appeared\r\n like my obstinacy in sustaining a thesis?\r\n\r\n They have the minds of crickets who pretend that I was making only\r\n cynical gestures on that occasion. Such gestures are the last to\r\n be tolerated by me; they are repugnant to the very depths of my\r\n conscience. And I feel as strongly against the show of strength.\r\n\r\n What strength? Against whom? With what aim? When I think about that,\r\n Gentlemen, I remember those strategists who, during the War, while we\r\n were eating in the trenches, made strategy with little pins on the\r\n maps. But when the problem is to get something done at the place of\r\n command and responsibility, things are seen in another light and have\r\n a different appearance. And yet on enough occasions, I have proved my\r\n energy. I have usually not failed to meet events.\r\n\r\n I have settled in six hours a revolt of the Royal Guards. In a few\r\n days I have broken an insidious revolt. In forty-eight hours I brought\r\n a division of Infantry and half of the fleet to Corfu. These gestures\r\n of energy—and the last one amazed even one of the greatest generals of\r\n a friendly Nation—are cited here to demonstrate that it is not energy\r\n that fails me.\r\n\r\n The death punishment? But that is a joke, Gentlemen! First of all, the\r\n death punishment must be inflicted under the penal code and, in any\r\n case, capital punishment cannot be the reprisal of a Government!\r\n\r\n It must be inflicted with restrained, better let us say very\r\n restrained, judgment, when the question is the life of a citizen. It\r\n was at the end of that month which is carved deeply into my life,\r\n that I said, “I want peace for the Italian people and I want to\r\n re-establish normal political life.”\r\n\r\n What was the answer to this policy of mine? First of all the secession\r\n of the Aventino—anti-constitutional secession, clearly revolutionary!\r\n Then a campaign of the press which lasted throughout the months of\r\n June, July and August. A dirty, miserable campaign which dishonored us\r\n for three months. The most fantastic, the most terrifying, the most\r\n frightful lies were affirmed extensively in the press.\r\n\r\n Investigations of underground happenings were also made; they invented\r\n things, they knew they were lying, but it was done all the same! I\r\n have always been peaceful and calm amid the storm. That storm will be\r\n remembered by those who will come after us with a sense of intimate\r\n shame. On September eleventh, somebody wanted to revenge a killing\r\n and shot one of our best men. He died poor—he had sixty lires in his\r\n pocket. But I continue my effort to normalize. I repress illegalities.\r\n I state the bare truth when I say that even now in our jails there are\r\n hundreds and hundreds of Fascists.\r\n\r\n It is the bare truth when I recall to you that I reopened the\r\n Parliament on the fixed date and that the discussion covered, with no\r\n lack of regularity, almost all the budgets.\r\n\r\n It is the bare truth that that oath of which you know is taken by the\r\n Militia and that the nomination of all the generals for all the zone\r\n commands is conducted as it is.\r\n\r\n Finally a question which raised our passions was presented—the\r\n question of accepting the resignation of Giunta. The Chamber was\r\n excited. I understood the sense of that revolt; however, after\r\n forty-eight hours I used my prestige and my influence. To a riotous\r\n and reluctant assembly I said: “Accept the resignation,” and the\r\n resignation was accepted.\r\n\r\n But this was not enough; I made a last effort to create normal\r\n conditions—the plan for electoral reform. How was that answered?\r\n It was answered by an accentuation of the campaign and by the\r\n assertion, “Fascism is a horde of barbarians camped on the Nation, and\r\n a movement of bandits and marauders.” Now they stage, Gentlemen, the\r\n moral question! We know the sad history of moral questions in Italy.\r\n\r\n But after all, Sirs, what butterflies are we looking for under the\r\n arch of Titus? Well, I declare here before this assembly, before all\r\n the Italian people, that I assume, I alone, the political, moral,\r\n historical responsibility for everything that has happened. If\r\n sentences, more or less maimed, are enough to hang a man, out with the\r\n noose! If Fascism has only been castor oil or a club, and not a proud\r\n passion of the best Italian youth, the blame is on me!\r\n\r\n If Fascism has been a criminal association, if all the violence\r\n has been the result of a determined historical, political, moral\r\n delinquency, the responsibility for this is on me, because I have\r\n created it with my propaganda from the time of our intervention in the\r\n War to this moment.\r\n\r\n In these last days not only the Fascists but many citizens ask\r\n themselves: Is there a Government? Have these men dignity as men?\r\n Have they dignity also as a Government? I have wanted to reach this\r\n determined extreme point. My experience of the life of these six\r\n months is rich. I have tried the Fascist Party. Just as to try the\r\n temper of some metals it is necessary to hit them with a hammer, so\r\n have I tested the temper of certain men. I have seen their value;\r\n I have seen for what reasons, at some moment when the wind seems\r\n contrary, they turn around the corner. I have tested myself. And be\r\n sure that I would not have persisted in measures if they had not\r\n been for the interests of the Nation. A people does not respect a\r\n Government which allows itself to be scorned. The people want to see\r\n their own dignity reflected in a Government, and the people, even\r\n before I said it, said, “Enough! The measure is filled.”\r\n\r\n And why was it filled? Because the revolt of the Aventino has a\r\n republican background.\r\n\r\n This sedition of the Aventino has had consequences, for now\r\n whoever in Italy is a Fascist risks his life! In the two months of\r\n November and December eleven Fascists were killed. One had his head\r\n crushed, and another one, an old man seventy-three years old, was\r\n killed and thrown from a high wall. Three fires happened in one\r\n month, three mysterious fires on the railroads, one in Rome, another\r\n in Parma, and the third in Florence. Then came a subversive movement\r\n everywhere.\r\n\r\n A chief of a squad of the Militia severely wounded by subversives.\r\n\r\n A fight between Carabinieri and subversives in Genzano.\r\n\r\n An attempted attack against the seat of the Fascists in Tarquinia.\r\n\r\n A man wounded by subversives in Verona.\r\n\r\n A soldier of the Militia wounded in the Province of Cremona.\r\n\r\n Fascists wounded by subversives in Forli.\r\n\r\n Communist ambush in San Giorgio di Pesaro.\r\n\r\n Subversives who sing the “Red Flag” and attack Fascists in Monzambano.\r\n\r\n In the three days of this January, 1925, and in a single zone\r\n incidents occurred in Mestre, Pionca, Valombra; fifty subversives\r\n armed with rifles strolled through the country singing the “Red Flag”\r\n and exploding petards. In Venice the Militiaman Pascai Mario was\r\n attacked and wounded. In Cavaso di Treviso another Fascist was hurt.\r\n In Crespano, the headquarters of the Carabinieri were invaded by about\r\n twenty frantic women, a chief of a detachment of Militia was attacked\r\n and thrown into the water. In Favara di Venezia Fascists were attacked\r\n by subversives.\r\n\r\n I bring your attention to these matters because they are symptoms. The\r\n Express train No. 192 was stoned by subversives who broke the windows.\r\n\r\n In Moduno di Livenza, a chief of the squad was attacked and beaten.\r\n You can see by this situation that the sedition of the Aventino has\r\n had deep repercussions throughout the whole Country. And then comes\r\n the struggle in which one side says: Enough! When two elements are\r\n struggling the solution lies in the test of strength. There never\r\n was any other solution in history, and never will be.\r\n\r\n Now I dare to say that the problem will be solved. Fascism, the\r\n Government, the Party, is at its highest efficiency. Gentlemen, you\r\n have deceived yourselves! You thought that Fascism was ended because\r\n I was restraining it, that the Party was dead because I was holding\r\n it back. If I should use a hundredth part of the energy that I used\r\n to compress the Fascists, to loosen them.... Oh! You should see, for\r\n then....\r\n\r\n But there will be no need of that, because the Government is strong to\r\n break fully and finally this revolt of the Aventino.\r\n\r\n Italy, Gentlemen, wants peace, wants quiet, wants work, wants calm; we\r\n will give it with love, if that be possible, or with strength, if that\r\n be necessary.\r\n\r\n You can be sure that in the forty-eight hours following this speech\r\n the situation will be clarified in every corner. We all know that this\r\n is not a personal fancy, not lust for government, not base passion,\r\n but only infinite and powerful love for my Country.\r\n\r\nThese words, restrained till then, together with my disdain and my\r\nforce of expression, suddenly awoke Fascist Italy. The situation, as\r\nI had foreseen, was clarified in forty-eight hours. The papers of the\r\nopposition, which till then had been full of envy, hate and defamatory\r\nattacks, began to slink into their holes again. A new situation, full\r\nof power and responsibility, was developing. Fascism had now all the\r\nattributes—after the long “quartarellista” parenthesis—to enable it to\r\nmarch onward and to govern by itself.\r\n\r\nIt was on that occasion that the Liberal ministers Sarrocchi and\r\nCasati, and also the minister Oviglio, a tepid Fascist, asked to\r\nresign from the ministry. I replaced them with three Fascist ministers.\r\nWe were coming back by the force of events to the historical origins of\r\nour movement, back to pure irreconcilableness.\r\n\r\nFascism, after my words full of my faith and my willingness to show\r\naudacity, was coming back to its warrior soul. Immediately, all those\r\nwho were out of Fascism wanted to participate in our movement, but\r\nin order not to load too much on our party the membership lists were\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nVictory was complete. The maneuvre of the former premiers definitely\r\nfailed and became ridiculous, just as did other artificial structures\r\nattempted about that time. One was a movement inspired by Benelli,\r\nunder the name of the Italian League, to create secessions from\r\nFascism, and another an underhand maneuvre by some shortweight\r\ngrandchildren of Garibaldi.\r\n\r\nAt the end of January, 1925, the Aventino, with all our opponents,\r\nappeared to have been destroyed, torn to pieces by a thousand internal\r\ndiscords and differences. I was winner again on the whole front and I\r\nwas getting ready to channel the Fascist revolution into institutions\r\nand into constitutional forms.\r\n\r\nOn October 28th, 1924, the National Militia, which represents the best\r\nof Fascism and which has always been my beloved creation, had sworn\r\nloyalty to the King. Now it was necessary to bring the Constitution of\r\n1848 up to date and to create new representative institutions, worthy\r\nof the new Italy.\r\n\r\nWith this aim I brought about the nomination of a commission of\r\neighteen experts on statecraft. I charged them with the preparation of\r\nproposals of reforms to be presented to our legislative organs.\r\n\r\nThe commission was then called the Commission of the Solons. It\r\nconcluded its work, after a certain time, suggesting some improvements\r\nin the old Constitution and the creation of new institutions. I\r\nafterward used the recommendations as a base. The commission at the\r\ntime did not lay down definite lines, but it contributed to the reforms\r\nwhich later on I began to see taking clearer shape and which were\r\napproved by the two branches of the national parliament.\r\n\r\nA law against secret societies was voted; so legal sanction was given\r\nto the struggle maintained by Fascism against Masonry. In fact, in\r\n1925, it was ridiculous to think that there could exist societies\r\nconstituted for performing a clandestine public act, outside the\r\ncontrol of the person who has the supreme direction of public affairs\r\nand beyond the control of all who fulfill any function of the law.\r\n\r\nA secret political society in modern, contemporary life is a thing of\r\nnonsense, when it is not a menace. I settled it that all associations\r\nshould be known in their aims, in their formations, membership and\r\ndevelopments.\r\n\r\nIt was at that time that Federzoni, then Minister of the Interior,\r\nprepared with my full approval the new law on public safety. Then we\r\nintrusted the Communes to the “Podesta,” drawing them away from the\r\nold electoral patronages, which were no longer suited to our time\r\nand our temper. The Governship of Rome was instituted and there began,\r\nbecause I had made up my mind to it, an inexorable fight against the\r\nMafia in Sicily, the bandits in Sardinia, and against other less widely\r\nknown forms of crime, which had humiliated entire regions.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1925, I fell desperately ill. For obvious reasons, and\r\nperhaps because of exaggerated apprehension, any exact account of my\r\ncondition and of my illness was never given out. I admit that the\r\nsituation was in a certain way very grave. For forty days I could\r\nnot come out of the house. My enemies now put their great hope in\r\nthe illusion, revived by their desire, that my end was near. The\r\nFascisti, because of my silence and the contradictory reports that\r\nwere circulating, were very troubled. Never, so much as then, did I\r\nunderstand that I was indispensable to my men, to my devoted people,\r\nto all the great masses of Italian people. I had lively, vibrating and\r\nmoving manifestations of solidarity, of devotion, of good will. The\r\nBlack Shirts roared impatiently to see me.\r\n\r\nWhen finally at the end of March, on the sixth anniversary of the\r\nfoundation of Fascism, I appeared healed on the balcony of the Palazzo\r\nChigi, I had in front of me all of Rome. The sight of me still thin\r\nand pale stirred deep emotion. I saluted the multitude in the name of\r\nSpring, and among other things I said, “Now will come the best!” This\r\nsentence was interpreted in a thousand senses and aroused a wave of\r\nplaudits and approbation.\r\n\r\nThe wise treatment of very clever doctors, such as Professor\r\nBastianelli and Professor Marchiafava, healed me completely. Those\r\nmiserable persons who had based their hopes upon my illness were\r\nbaffled. Nothing is more hateful to me than a hope that an illness may\r\nend one’s adversary. I am more alive and stronger than ever before. I\r\ncould repeat what I said one day, after an attempt against my life:\r\n“The bullets pass, Mussolini remains.”\r\n\r\nAnother train of events which was to mark my complex and difficult\r\nexistence was the attempts against my life.\r\n\r\nZaniboni initiated the series. He was a vulgar Socialist, who received\r\ntwo checks of 150,000 francs each from the Czechoslovakian Socialists\r\nto lead an anti-Fascist struggle. Naturally Zaniboni, a drug addict,\r\nused the 300,000 francs to prepare with devilish ability for his\r\nattempt against me. He chose the sacred day of the commemoration of the\r\nvictory. He ambushed himself in a room of the Hotel Dragoni, just in\r\nfront of the Palazzo Chigi, from the balcony of which I usually review\r\nthe processions which pass on the way to the altar of the Unknown\r\nSoldier to offer their flowers, their vows and their homage.\r\n\r\nHaving an Austrian rifle with fine sights, the fellow could not miss\r\nhis aim. Zaniboni, to avoid being suspected, dressed himself in the\r\nuniform of a major of the army, and got ready in the morning to\r\naccomplish his crime. He was discovered. He had been followed for a\r\nlong time. A few days before, General Capello had generously\r\ngiven him money and advice. Masonry had made of him its ensign. But\r\nby simultaneous action, Zaniboni, General Capello and various less\r\nimportant personages in the plot were arrested one hour before they\r\nplanned the attempt.\r\n\r\nSo closed the first chapter.\r\n\r\nIn 1926, in the month of April, when I inaugurated the International\r\nCongress of Medicine, a crazy and megalomaniac woman of English\r\nnationality, exalted by fanaticism, came near my motor car and at\r\nclose range fired a shot that perforated my nostrils. A centimeter’s\r\ndifference and the shot might have been fatal. It was, as I said, a\r\nmad, hysterical woman, led on by elements and persons never clearly\r\nidentified.\r\n\r\nI abandoned her to her destiny by putting her beyond the frontier,\r\nwhere she could meditate on her failure and her folly.\r\n\r\nJust after the occurrence, before my nose was out of its dressings, I\r\nwas speaking to a meeting of officials from all parts of Italy. I felt\r\nimpelled to say, “If I go forward, follow me; if I recoil, kill me; if\r\nI die, avenge me!”\r\n\r\nAnother attempt which might have had grave results was that of an\r\nanarchist, called Lucetti, who had come back from France with his soul\r\nfull of hate and envy against Fascism and against me. He waited for me\r\nin the light and large Via Nomentana, in front of Porta Pia. He was\r\nable to meditate his crime in silence. He had been eight days in Rome\r\nand carried powerful bombs. Lucetti recognized my car, while I was\r\ngoing to the Palazzo Chigi, and as soon as he saw it he hurled at\r\nme the infernal machine, which hit an angle of the car and bounced back\r\non the ground, exploding there after I had passed. I was not wounded,\r\nbut innocent people were hurt and taken to the hospital.\r\n\r\nWhen arrested, the miserable man could justify his crazy act only by\r\nhis anti-Fascist hate. I did not attach a great importance to the\r\nepisode. Having to meet the English ambassador, I went directly to the\r\nPalazzo Chigi and the conversation with the foreign diplomat continued\r\ncalmly enough until a great popular demonstration in the streets\r\ninterrupted us. Only then the English ambassador, somewhat amazed,\r\nlearned of the attempt against my life.\r\n\r\nThe last attempt was made on October 31st, 1926. It was in Bologna,\r\nafter I had lived a day full of life, enthusiasm and pride.\r\n\r\nA young anarchist, egged on by secret plotters, at a moment when the\r\nwhole population was lined up for the salute, came out from the ranks\r\nand fired a gun at my car. I was sitting near the “Podesta” of Bologna,\r\nArpinati. The shot burned my coat, but again I was quite safe. The\r\ncrowd, in the meanwhile, seized by an impulse of exasperated fury,\r\ncould not be restrained. It administered summary justice to the man.\r\n\r\nOther attempts were baffled. The exasperation was now surpassing\r\nany limit. I understood that it was time to stop the doleful game\r\nof the adversaries. The secret societies, the opposition press, and\r\ndeceitful political cults had only one aim: it was to hit the chief of\r\nFascism, so that all Fascism should be hit. The entire movement\r\nthat dominated Italy they believed turned on one pivot, on a name, on\r\na lone man. All the adversaries, from the most hateful ones to the\r\nmost intelligent, from the slyest ones to the most fanatical, thought\r\nthat the only way of destroying Fascism was to destroy its chief. The\r\npeople themselves perceived this and demanded grave punishments for the\r\ncriminals. The exasperated Fascists wanted to admonish all those who\r\nwere conspiring in the darkness.\r\n\r\nA policy of force was absolutely necessary. I took over the Ministry of\r\nInternal Affairs, and launched the laws for the defense of the régime,\r\nlaws which were to constitute the one essential basis for the new\r\nunified national life.\r\n\r\nI abolished the subversive press, whose only function was to inflame\r\nmen’s minds. Provincial commissions sent to confinement professional\r\nsubversives. Not a day goes by that we do not feel in Italian life how\r\nmuch good has been wrought by these measures against the forces of\r\ndisintegration, disorder and disloyalty.\r\n\r\nI must then conclude that a strong policy has yielded really tangible\r\nresults. Every day the country feels intensely the identification of\r\nFascism with the vital strength of the nation. Nobody suffers ostracism\r\nin Italy; everybody is allowed to live under the definite régime of\r\nlaw. Many elements of the old popular subversives understand now to\r\nwhat extent a well regulated life is a benefit, not only for one class,\r\nbut for every class of the Italian people. Few are those who are still\r\nconfined, and few are those who intend to disobey. As Minister\r\nof the Interior, I distributed a circular on January 6th, 1927, to\r\nthe Prefects, in which I pointed out what their duty in regard to the\r\npopulation must be.\r\n\r\nA new sense of justice, of serious purpose, of harmony and concord\r\nguides now the destinies of all the peoples and classes of Italy. There\r\nare neither vexations nor violence, but there is exaltation of what is\r\ngood and exaltation of the virtue of heroism. In every class, among all\r\ncitizens, nothing is done against the state, nothing is done outside\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\nMany have finally opened their eyes to this serene and severe truth;\r\nthe Italians feel themselves of one fraternity in a great work of\r\njustice. The sense of duty, the necessity of action, the manner of\r\ncivil life mark now an intense reawakening. The old parties are forever\r\ndead. In Fascism politics is fused into a living moral reality; it is a\r\nfaith. It is one of those spiritual forces which renovates the history\r\nof great and enduring peoples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                               NEW PATHS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen one watches the building of new structures, when hammers and\r\nconcrete mixers flash and turn, the occasion is not one for asking\r\nthe superintendent his opinion about the plays of Bernard Shaw or\r\nfor expecting the architect to babble discursively on the subject\r\nof his preferences between the mountains and the seashore as summer\r\nplaygrounds.\r\n\r\nIt is absurd to suppose that I and my life can be separated from that\r\nwhich I have been doing and am doing. The creation of the Fascist\r\nstate and the passing of the hungry moments from sunrise to the deep\r\nprofundity of night with its promise of another dawn eager for new\r\nlabors, cannot be picked apart. I am lock-stitched into this fabric.\r\nIt and myself are woven into one. Other men may find romance in the\r\nfluttering of the leaves on a bough; as for me, whatever I might have\r\nbeen, destiny and my own self have made me one whose eyes, ears, whose\r\nevery sense, every thought, whose entire time, entire energy must be\r\ndirected at the trunk of the tree of public life.\r\n\r\nThe poetry of my life has become the poetry of construction. The\r\nromance in my existence has become the romance of measures,\r\npolicies, and the future of a state. These to me are redolent with\r\ndrama.\r\n\r\nSo it is that as I look back over nearly six years of leadership I see\r\nthe solution of problems, each of which is a chapter in my life and a\r\nchapter in the life of my country. A chapter, long or short, simple\r\nor complex, in the history of the advance and experimentation and\r\npioneering of mankind.\r\n\r\nI am not deeply concerned at being misunderstood. It is more or less\r\ntrivial that conspiracies go on to misinterpret and, indeed, entirely\r\nto misrepresent what I have sought and why I have sought it. After all,\r\nI have been too busy to hear the murmurs of liars.\r\n\r\nHe who looks back over his shoulder toward those who lag and those who\r\nlie is a waster; it is because I cannot write my life—my daily life,\r\nmy active life, my thinking life and even my own peculiar, emotional\r\nlife—without recording the steps I have taken to renew Italy and find a\r\nnew place for her in the general march of civilization, that I call up\r\none after another the recollection of my recent battles over measures\r\nwhich submerge men, over policies which bury, under their simplicity\r\nand weight, everything else I might have lived.\r\n\r\nTwo fields of my will and action, of my thoughts and my conclusions,\r\nstand out as I write and as I record my life itself.\r\n\r\nI think of all of them in terms of utter simplicity, stripped of\r\ncomplex phrases. I have seen the futility of those who endlessly speak\r\nstreams of words. These words are like armies enlisted to go away\r\nforever into the night, never to return from a campaign in which\r\nthe enemies are compromise of principle, and cowardice, inaction, and\r\nidealism without realism.\r\n\r\nThere are those, no doubt, who regard me or have once regarded me as an\r\nenemy to the peace of the world. To them there is nothing to say unless\r\nit be to recommend my autobiography to them for careful reading. The\r\nrecord of facts is worth more than the accusation of fools.\r\n\r\nFrom the first, I wanted to renovate from bottom to top the foreign\r\npolicy of Italy. Let it be remembered that I was fully conscious\r\nalways of the history and the economic and spiritual possibilities\r\nof my country in its relation to the world. Such a renovation, such\r\na remaking of policy, was absolutely new for us. It was destined to\r\nmeet serious preconceptions and misconceptions before it would be\r\nclearly understood and appreciated, not only by Italians, but by those\r\nresponsible for the foreign policies of various nations.\r\n\r\nI was fully aware that a new spirit, one of new austerity and dignity,\r\nimposed by me to govern every large and small action of my ministry,\r\nmight create the impression that I wanted to fight to a finish old\r\ninternational political tradition, organization, and existing alliances\r\nand the status quo.\r\n\r\nWhat an error! To inaugurate a firm stand does not mean to\r\nrevolutionize the course of international dealings. To demand a\r\nbetter appraisal of Italy, in accordance with a correct audit of\r\nour possibilities as a powerful and prolific nation, was only to\r\nre-establish our rightful position.\r\n\r\nMy problem was to open the eyes of the responsible elements in the\r\nvarious European governments and chanceries. They had gone on rather\r\nblindly considering Italy to be in its unstable position after the war.\r\n\r\nTo open these eyes, sometimes with vigorous calls for attention,\r\nwas not always easy. I spent months and years in bringing about a\r\nrealization abroad that Italy’s foreign policy had no tricks in it. It\r\nwas always straightforward, and swerved not. It was always vigilant.\r\nIt was based on an accurate appraisal of facts, squarely faced, and it\r\ndemanded equally that others should face facts. This understanding has\r\ncontributed, naturally, to bringing Italy higher on the horizon of the\r\nworld’s eternal dawn of new events.\r\n\r\nA speech on foreign policy delivered by me in the Italian senate in\r\nthe spring of 1928 reviewed our entire national and international\r\nsituation, and the part that Italy has played in the many little or\r\ngreat events of world life. It set forth a clear review of my work. It\r\nsummarized the concrete success won by my ministry. It brought out that\r\nwe had correctly insisted upon new appraisals of Italy’s part in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nBut, before this concrete and tangible result was reached, let no one\r\nbelieve that the steps were light and easy. I knew well enough how many\r\nwould look toward Rome with suspicion, as if it were an irresponsible\r\ncentre of disturbance. Enemies of our country and of Fascism tried\r\nin every way in their power to strengthen, by bad faith, by twisted\r\ninterpretations, and by false news, all the errors in foreign judgments\r\nof what I was trying to do.\r\n\r\nBut truth usually comes along behind any simple, clear policy and\r\novercomes the obliquity, the conventional mentality, the spirit of\r\nopportunism, and the lie-barking of the yesterdays.\r\n\r\nThere is no country in the world in which foreign policy, though\r\ncarefully carved out and approved by the nation, is not subject to\r\ninternal attack based on ignorance or bad faith. Therefore it was\r\nno surprise to me to find that even when I had calmed the internal\r\npolitical situation and had established for us the main points of the\r\ngeneral policy of Italy within and without, there were those who began\r\nan offensive of criticism.\r\n\r\nOne of them was Count Sforza, who in October, 1922, was in Paris as\r\nItalian ambassador.\r\n\r\nThis man, loquacious and irresponsible as a minister in the past\r\ngovernments, had been a nuisance to the country. He had linked his name\r\nwith the Adriatic situation, humiliating for our nation. This former\r\nminister, an amateur in everything that concerned any perplexity of\r\nforeign policy, showed himself so vain that he could not sense the\r\ndelicacy of his position in Paris. While in Italy events of historic\r\ncharacter were maturing, homesickness for lost power made him a bad\r\nservant of his own country. He even went to the point of trying to\r\ncreate difficulties for the Fascist government in the French capital.\r\nAlready political groups there were unfavorable to if not envious of,\r\nany new solidarity in Italy. Count Sforza at once began to criticise\r\nopenly my declaration on foreign and internal policy, my political\r\nmethod and my concept of Fascist Italy. I sent him a telegram, and this\r\nis what I said:\r\n\r\n “I must interpret as a not quite amiable and rather an awkward\r\n gesture, your decision to hand in your resignation before having\r\n officially known my orders as to foreign policy, which I will disclose\r\n in the Chamber of Parliament; orders that will not be merely a sum\r\n of sentiments and resentments, as you wrongly think. I bid you now\r\n formally to keep your place and not create difficulties for the\r\n Government. In this moment, the Government represents the highest\r\n expression of the national conscience. I am waiting for a telegraphic\r\n answer and I reserve my later decision as to you.\r\n\r\n Mussolini.”\r\n\r\nTo this telegram Count Sforza made an elusive answer. So I called him\r\nto Rome and after some explanations which revealed our two minds to be\r\nin complete antithesis, I relieved him of office and dismissed him from\r\nhis place. It was time that the central authority should no longer be\r\ndebated by those who occupied inferior positions. Italian political\r\nlife needs command and organization and discipline. Our representatives\r\nabroad were sometimes shown to have a cold, isolated, autonomous life,\r\nfar removed from their primary duties toward their country.\r\n\r\nThis first strong gesture of mine was a clear signal; it undoubtedly\r\nserved as an example and admonition for many others of our diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives, who tried to withdraw themselves, with subjective\r\nattitudes, beyond the supreme authority of the state.\r\n\r\nHaving closed this breach in our diplomacy I dedicated all my energies\r\nto the solution of those political problems which would determine\r\nour future. I found facing me a situation already distorted and\r\nprejudiced by the crass errors of preceding governments. I found\r\na series of peace treaties which, though in some respects full of\r\ndefects, nevertheless constituted as a whole an unavoidable state of\r\nfact squarely to be met.\r\n\r\nStill palpitating and open in Italy was the wound of the Rapallo\r\ntreaty with Jugoslavia. I wanted to medicate that and heal it. On the\r\ndelicate ground of treaties I explained my position and suggestions\r\nin a speech about foreign policy delivered in the chamber, November\r\n16th, 1922. I said then, as I always say, that “treaties, whether bad\r\nor good, must be carried out. A respectable nation can have no other\r\nprogramme. But treaties are neither eternal nor irreparable. They are\r\nchapters of history, not epilogues of history.” Speaking of foreign\r\npolicy in relation to the different groups of powers, I summarized my\r\nthoughts with this definition: “We cannot allow ourselves either a plan\r\nof insane altruism or one of complete subservience to the plans of the\r\nother peoples. Ours is then a policy of autonomy. It shall be firm and\r\nsevere.”\r\n\r\nIn November, 1922, I met, at Lausanne, Poincaré of France and Curzon\r\nof Great Britain. Let it be said that I re-established then and there,\r\non my first personal contact with the Allies, our equality. There were\r\nsome clear and precise interviews; some went on to a rather vivacious\r\ntune!\r\n\r\nFor the time had come for Italy, with its record of sacrifice and with\r\nthe weight of its history, to enter into an equality of standing\r\nin discussions of an international nature side by side with England and\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nDuring my brief stay at Lausanne I held conferences also with the\r\nForeign Minister of Rumania and with Mr. Richard Washburn Child,\r\nAmbassador of the United States in Rome, and chief of the United States\r\ndelegation at the Conference. I eliminated also the question of the\r\nDodecannes.\r\n\r\nTo sum up my trip to Switzerland; these were the results:\r\n\r\nFirst, we made clear to foreign diplomats the new prestige of Italy.\r\n\r\nSecond, we gave examples of our new style in foreign policy at the\r\nmoment of initiating a direct contact between myself and responsible\r\ndiplomats of the world.\r\n\r\nIn December of that year, I made other important declarations to the\r\ncouncil of the ministers about our foreign affairs. I examined again\r\nthe Treaty of Rapallo. I began a solution of the problems of Fiume and\r\nDalmatia, making that solution fit in with the situation created by\r\nthe preceding treaties to which I had fallen heir. For the second time\r\nI met Lord Curzon, and then I went on to London, where I stayed for\r\nseveral days. On that occasion I was received with the most generous\r\nhospitality and found that I was listened to with respect by the\r\nEnglish political world.\r\n\r\nAlready the question of the Allies’ debts was on the table. I had\r\ndiscussed this with Mr. Child and with the British ambassador in Rome.\r\nI had a plan that I do not hesitate to claim was one of the most\r\nefficacious for the solution of that problem. My plan aroused a\r\ncertain interest among the Allies, but some divergencies of a secondary\r\ncharacter, and particularly the design of France to occupy the Ruhr,\r\nkilled that which in my opinion was the most logical solution of the\r\ndebt question, combined with the problem of the German reparations.\r\nIt was a solution which might have permitted a quick and powerful\r\nrestoration of world economy.\r\n\r\nAlways before me in my foreign policy is the economic aspect of\r\ninternational problems. That was why in 1923 I concluded a series of\r\ncommercial treaties, with a political background, with a number of\r\nnations. It amuses me to be called an anti-pacifist, in the light\r\nof our record of treaty-making for peace and for fair international\r\ndealings.\r\n\r\nThese commercial treaties were very helpful in settling our economic\r\nposition. In February of 1923 I signed the Italian-Swiss treaty,\r\nconcluded in Zurich; I ratified the Washington treaty for the\r\nlimitation of naval armaments. Other commercial treaties were concluded\r\nwith Czechoslovakia, with Poland, with Spain, and, finally, with\r\nFrance. I took the first steps to renew commercial relations with\r\nSoviet Russia.\r\n\r\nOur record in international affairs discloses a sleepless vigilance\r\nto build peace and make friends. More peace, more friends. We yield\r\nnothing of our autonomy, nor do we allow our power to be used as a pawn\r\nby others. We are idealists in the sense that we endeavor to make and\r\nkeep peace by building and maintaining, brick by brick, stone by stone,\r\na structure of peace founded on realities rather than on dreams\r\nand visionary plans. I have insisted upon being strong, but I have\r\nlabored to be generous.\r\n\r\nFor an efficient foreign service, the world requires some housecleaning\r\nin its diplomatic machinery, which has grown stale, over-manned, and\r\nbureaucratic, and filled with feeble, petty conspiracies to gain place\r\nand promotion.\r\n\r\nI then began, in the reorganization of our consulates, an elimination\r\nof foreign functionaries. That work was long and wide-spread, because\r\nit was necessary to rebuild our old consular organization. The\r\nrenovation, complex as were its problems, was completed with unswerving\r\ninsistence.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this complex task of foreign policy and machinery,\r\nand while I was studying the solution of the Adriatic problem, there\r\ncame the news that the Italian military mission in Albania had been\r\ntreacherously ambushed on a road and massacred in its entirety by\r\nbandits from the border. In this tragic happening there were wiped out\r\nbrave General Enrico Tellini, Surgeon-Major Luigi Corte, Artillery\r\nLieutenant Mario Bonacini, and a soldier, Farneti. The Italian military\r\nmission was in Albania, together with other foreign missions, with a\r\nwell-defined task, laid out by definite international agreements. The\r\noffense to Italy and to the Italian name hit the sensibilities of Italy\r\nsquarely in the face. History furnishes other examples of such outrages\r\nand points to accepted standards. I made myself the interpreter of\r\nthe righteous wrath of Italians everywhere. I at once sent an\r\nultimatum to Greece.\r\n\r\nI demanded an apology. I demanded payment of fifty million lire as\r\nindemnity.\r\n\r\nGreece turned to us a deaf ear. Pretexts and excuses met my request.\r\nThere was an attempt by Greece to find allies to aid her to slide away\r\nfrom my demands. I would not play that base game. Without hesitation I\r\nsent units of our naval squadron to the Greek island of Corfu. There\r\nthe Italian marines landed. At the same time I sent a note to the\r\npowers. The League of Nations declared itself incompetent to judge and\r\nsolve the incident. I continued the occupation of Corfu, declaring\r\nclearly that Italy would withdraw from the League if we could not\r\nobtain there a satisfactory attitude. This was not a mere matter\r\nof insult by words; it concerned the lives of Italian officers and\r\nsoldiers. It was impossible to believe that I could allow this tragic\r\npage to be turned over with nothing more than some bureaucratic gesture.\r\n\r\nThere has been so much misrepresentation and nonsense as to this\r\noutrage and the settlement of our demands that I may do well to state\r\nthe simple facts, which any school child can understand and digest.\r\n\r\nThe case, when brought for judgment to the Conference of the\r\nAmbassadors, received, as was to be expected, a verdict favorable to\r\nthe Italian position.\r\n\r\nGreece gave me all the satisfaction that I had asked. The indemnity was\r\npaid. I offered ten millions of this indemnity to the Greek refugees.\r\nThereafter, having obtained full satisfaction, I recalled the\r\nsquadron from Corfu. The book was closed.\r\n\r\nBut that month was indeed one of tragic happenings. The new Fascist\r\nstyle of foreign policy had satisfied the sensibility of all the\r\nItalians, but I admit that it had hurt the feelings of many foreign\r\nelements which saw in my foreign policy something out of the ordinary,\r\ndisturbing to many and preventing plans opposed to the rights of Italy.\r\nI allowed nothing to deflect me. I made important declarations to the\r\nsenate, both as to the Greek incident and on the question of Fiume. I\r\nsaid then that the most painful inheritance of our foreign policy was\r\nFiume, but that nevertheless I was treating with Jugoslavia to solve,\r\nwith the slightest possible damage, the very grave Adriatic situation\r\ninherited as a consequence of the Treaty of Rapallo.\r\n\r\nThe senate approved my policies and my acts.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1924, I was able at last to conclude with Pasic, the great\r\nSerb statesman, and with Nincic, the Jugoslav minister, a new treaty\r\nbetween Italy and our neighbor. As a consequence of this treaty Fiume\r\nbecame Italian. Other moves, continued in 1925, brought to signature\r\nthe Nettuno Conventions, which regulated all the relations of good\r\nneighborliness between the two states. It remains for Jugoslavia to\r\nratify.\r\n\r\nAt the end of all this diplomatic work on a wide field we definitely\r\nlost Dalmatia, we lost cities sacred to Italy by the history and the\r\nvery soul of the populations which live in them. These had been assured\r\nus by the pact of London. No better settlement was possible than\r\nthe one that I, with the good-will and the eagerness that I and\r\nPasic and Nincic put into the negotiations, was able to draw up.\r\n\r\nThough there is yet no Jugoslavian ratification of the Nettuno\r\nConventions, our borders are well guarded and sure. Jugoslavia may show\r\nits good will; in any case we now can look calmly into the eyes of our\r\ntroubled neighbor.\r\n\r\nThe foreign programme in 1924 obtained in the senate three hundred\r\nand fifteen favorable votes against six, with twenty-six absent.\r\nIn December of that same year I had an interview with Chamberlain,\r\nnew Foreign Minister of the British Empire. In the many events of\r\ninternational character I have always found him a friend of Italy and\r\nof Italians.\r\n\r\nIn 1925 I had to undergo a lively struggle with the government of\r\nAfghanistan. In the capital of that distant country one of our\r\ncountrymen, an engineer, Piperno, who had gone there to work and study,\r\nhad been slain, as a consequence of some events of internal character.\r\nThe Afghan government refused to pay an indemnity to the family of\r\nPiperno. I had to send something of a demand. Though it was a definite\r\nclaim for satisfaction, I did not close the door on the resumption\r\nof good friendship with the distant state, and indeed, the King of\r\nAfghanistan later had in Rome the warmest and most sympathetic of\r\nreceptions.\r\n\r\nThe clouds come and pass away, and new clouds come into our skies. A\r\nnew cloud showed in the anti-Italian propaganda, laid down by Germans\r\nin the region of our eastern border. In February, 1926, when the\r\nFascist policy had made its justice, its weight and strength felt in\r\nthe mixed-population zone of the High Adige, I had to speak clearly\r\nas to the problem of our relations with those Germans behind the\r\nBrenner Pass. I made two straight-from-the-shoulder speeches that\r\nshook many a timid and selfconscious plotter or sentimentalist. These\r\nare not practised in the habits of a school of courage and strength.\r\nI dismissed on that occasion another ambassador, Bosdari, who, at the\r\ncentre of an event as significant as was this, one concerning deeply\r\nthe relations between the Italian and the German people, was not able\r\nto behave as we might expect an ambassador of a power like Italy to\r\nbehave.\r\n\r\nThe frank speech that I made on that occasion—it was cut from the same\r\ncloth as that I used in similar circumstances against the policy of\r\nSeipel, Premier of Austria—undoubtedly cleared our relations with the\r\nGerman population behind the borders.\r\n\r\nThis question of the High Adige, however, was framed in a wide vision\r\nof our relations with all other states. It was just at that time that I\r\nhad a series of important interviews with the Bulgarian, Polish, Greek,\r\nTurkish and Rumanian foreign ministers.\r\n\r\nThanks then to this intense political rhythm, Rome became every\r\nday more and more a centre of attraction for important political\r\nactivities and political exchange. The loyal character of my foreign\r\npolicy, followed and appreciated by all Italians, has given Italy more\r\nconsideration from other nations. A loyal policy is the one which\r\nscores the greatest success. Ambiguities and vagueness are not in my\r\ntemperament, and consequently they are strangers to any policy of mine.\r\nI feel that I can speak with firmness and dignity, because I have\r\nbehind me a people who, having fulfilled their duties, now have sacred\r\nrights to defend and for which to demand respect.\r\n\r\nI have sent forth messages of brotherhood and faith to the Italians who\r\nlive beyond our borders; I did not give them the name of emigrants,\r\nbecause in the past this word has had a humiliating meaning, and it\r\nseemed in some way to imply an inferior category of men and women. I\r\nhave been able, I am glad to say, to protect my countrymen without\r\nwounding the susceptibilities of other peoples. This protection is\r\nfounded on international law and on good sense in all exchanges between\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nItaly on its part has accorded the greatest hospitality to all those\r\nwho for business, for religious faith, for pleasure, or even for\r\ncuriosity have wanted to visit our soil. I have taught Italians to\r\nshow appropriate respect for foreign representatives in our country;\r\nit is never admissible, in fact, for diplomatic controversies to be\r\ntwisted or troubled by angry popular demonstrations against embassies\r\nor consulates. Such disorders belong to an old democratic habit which\r\nFascism has clearly outgrown. There have been delicate moments in\r\nItalian affairs during which resentment and protest might easily have\r\nbeen exhibited. I have always held these protests within the limits\r\nof Fascist dignity, though often they have been exaggerated in\r\nthe foreign press. This is no slight undertaking, even for one who has\r\nimposed upon himself the task of giving order and discipline to the\r\nItalian people.\r\n\r\nThe foreign policy of Italy as directed by me has been simple,\r\nunderstandable, and rests on these main points:\r\n\r\nFirst, mine is a policy of peace. It is founded not upon words,\r\ngestures, and mere paper transactions, but comes from an elevated\r\nnational prestige and from a whole network of agreements and treaties\r\nwhich cement harmony between peoples.\r\n\r\nSecond, I have not made any specific alliances with the great powers.\r\nInstead, I have negotiated a series of treaties which show a clear and\r\ndecisive will to assure to Italy a prosperity in its relations with all\r\nnations, especially with those of great historical importance, such as\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nNor have I failed to work out a whole series of treaties with minor\r\npowers, so that Italian influence could have its part in general\r\nprogress. Albania is one case. Hungary and Turkey are others. To assure\r\nharmony on the Mediterranean, I have established accord with Spain;\r\nto make possible a greater development of our industries and of our\r\nforeign trade, I resumed independent commercial relations with Russia.\r\n\r\nStupid indeed are those who fail to see that I have taken a serene,\r\nrespectful attitude, but not a humble one. The League of Nations and\r\nsome of the diplomacy inspired by the Locarno treaty are witnesses of\r\nthat. I made reservations, after meditated discussions, and because\r\nof my well-grounded beliefs regarding the disarmament pacts, I\r\nnoticed some absurdities in them.\r\n\r\nI have bettered and completed the consular organization and I have put\r\nin it a series of new men born with and grown out of Fascism. They have\r\nsuffered the passion of the war and the passion of our rebirth. In the\r\nmeantime I did not fail to bring Fascism also to our colonies, I wanted\r\nto extend the standards which demanded discipline and insured full\r\nharmony for all Italian initiatives. These must be concentrated from\r\nnow on in the representatives of our policies.\r\n\r\nA sense of new life and pride fills not only the Italians in Italy,\r\nbut all our countrymen scattered about the world. Italy now enjoys the\r\nrespect of those nations which evolve and put into effect world policy.\r\n\r\nMy colonial policy has simple affinity with my foreign policy. Even\r\ntaking into consideration the virtues of our colonizing peoples,\r\neven remembering all the fine human material we have given for the\r\ndevelopment of entire regions of the African and American worlds,\r\nbefore the war and after, we had failed to realize the potential\r\npossibilities of our colonial programme. We had failed to bring it to\r\nvigor and fruitfulness.\r\n\r\nWe missed then that legitimate satisfaction which should have come to\r\nus as of right and from duty fulfilled during and after the war.\r\n\r\nColonial development would not have been for us merely a logical\r\nconsequence of our population problem, but would have provided a\r\nformula for the solution of our economic situation. Even now, at this\r\ndistance of ten years from the war, this problem has still to\r\nfind its full solution. Our colonies are few, and not all open to\r\nextensive improvement. Eritrea, which is the first of our colonies,\r\nhas not undergone any change. Somaliland has been augmented by British\r\nGiubaland, following a diplomatic accord.\r\n\r\nLately, thanks to the wise policies of Governor De Vecchi, we have\r\npacified all Somaliland, and considerable Italian capital is moving\r\ntoward that colony of ours, to be used for definite objects and to\r\nprovide work for Italian labor. The Libian colony—which includes\r\nCirenaica and Tripolitania—was reduced during the war to the occupation\r\nof the coast and some of the principal cities. Fascism, on assuming\r\npower, found grave conditions. These also have been cleared up. Our\r\npolicy of military occupation, and of course of economic penetration,\r\nhas assured us the full and uncontested domination of Cirenaica as far\r\nas Giarabub, and of Tripolitania as far as the border recognized by\r\ntreaties of international character.\r\n\r\nThere is a great fervor of rebirth in both colonies. Tripoli has become\r\none of the most beautiful Mediterranean cities. A congress of medical\r\nmen has adjudged it a health resort. We have found water for the city\r\nand water in the hills for irrigation. I made a visit to the zone of\r\nTripoli, and that gave me a conviction as to all the possibilities for\r\nimprovements that can be extended to the entire colony. There are zones\r\nin Garian which can compete in production and fertility with the better\r\nzones of southern Italy. The same can be said about the high\r\nplain of Cirenaica. In this last region I have abolished a curious\r\nform of parliament created by the weakness of our former governments.\r\nNow the governors enjoy complete influence and complete responsibility\r\nfor the welfare of nations and Italians. These regions are pacified.\r\nImmigration continues to go there. Capital goes; laborers go.\r\n\r\nThese two colonies alone cannot solve our population problem. Mark this\r\nwell. But with good-will and with the help of the typical colonizing\r\nqualities of Italians, we can give value to two regions which once\r\nwere owned by Rome and which must grow to the greatness of their past\r\nand contribute to the new and greatly expanding possibilities of our\r\ngeneral economic progress.\r\n\r\nInto these labors to rebuild Italy’s peaceful position before the\r\nworld, and to develop as duty dictates every colonial possibility which\r\nmay help to solve our population problems, I have put my days and some\r\nof my sleepless nights. But it would be absurd to suppose that life\r\nwas quite so easy for me as to allow me to stop with international and\r\ncolonial questions.\r\n\r\nLet us turn to the amazing and dramatic financial situation.\r\n\r\nA leader of the Liberal party in parliament, Peano, six months before\r\nthe March on Rome, had defined the deficit of our budget by a figure of\r\nmore than six billions!\r\n\r\nThe financial situation was then, according even to the declaration of\r\nour opponents, desperately serious. I knew what a difficult inheritance\r\nI had received. It had come down to me as a legacy from the\r\nerrors and weaknesses of those who had preceded me. In fact, I fully\r\nunderstood that with such an important leak in the hull of the Ship of\r\nState, any great voyage of progress would be impossible. Finance, then,\r\nwas one of the most delicate and urgent problems to be solved, if I\r\nwanted to rebuild and elevate our credit abroad and at home.\r\n\r\nThere were many demands due and waiting; necessity had turned the\r\nprinting presses to the production of new paper-money, driving down\r\nand down the value of Italian currency. An irresponsible and demagogic\r\npolicy had been followed, which had brought about complex makeshifts.\r\nThese not only affected the soundness of the budget, but also were\r\nundermining all our economic life and the whole efficiency of the state.\r\n\r\nI had to deal a smashing blow to useless expenditures, and to those who\r\nsought tribute from the treasury. I had to rake up tax-slackers. I had\r\nto establish severest economy in every branch of state administration.\r\nI had to put a brake on the endless increase of employees. Furthermore,\r\nthe obligation of settling our debts to foreign powers was staring me\r\nin the face. Even if our resources were limited, this supreme act of\r\nwisdom and honesty had to be performed.\r\n\r\nIt goes without discussion that for states as for individual citizens,\r\nwhen a debt has been signed and acknowledged it must be paid, and faith\r\nmust be kept as to obligations undertaken.\r\n\r\nFor this work I picked a capable man; I appointed as Minister of\r\nFinance the Honorable De Stefani, a Fascist and a Doctor of\r\nPolitical Economy. He was able to curtail expenses, repress abuses, and\r\ncreate new sources of revenue and taxes; in this way the budget was\r\nalmost balanced within two years.\r\n\r\nI demobolized all the economic organization left over from war time; I\r\neliminated the useless bureaucracy of the new provinces, still burdened\r\nby the debts and indemnities of war. I settled all these with an issue\r\nof bonds, quickly subscribed.\r\n\r\nBefore launching a policy of severe economy, I wanted to do full\r\njustice to the invalids of the war. I fixed, with special privileges\r\nand without regard to economy, the obligations that the state was to\r\nassume in their favor and in favor of the orphans and widows of those\r\nwho had died in battle. After having repaired in this way a cruel\r\nwrong, and fulfilled a duty toward those who had given their life and\r\ntheir blood to the country, it was easy for me to strike at certain\r\nforms of exaggerated and sudden wealth derived from war profits. There\r\nis no doubt that I have been very harsh in this matter. But why not?\r\nThese unjust pocketbook privileges represented an offense against those\r\nwho had suffered for the war, suffered not only in misery or death, but\r\nalso in loss of money and property.\r\n\r\nWhile striving to eliminate all that burdened the economy and finance\r\nof the state, I tried to promote individual production to the greatest\r\ndegree. I had to respect honestly accumulated wealth, and make\r\neverybody understand the value, not only economic but also moral, of\r\ninheritance transmittable in families. Because of this, though I\r\nhad approved a tax reform of great importance, I restored many basic\r\nrights, such as the right of succession.\r\n\r\nIt was made clear that I would never approve subjecting inheritance\r\nto a taxation which had almost assumed a socialistic character of\r\nexpropriation. Interference with succession strikes a blow at the\r\ninstitution of the family. I aroused controversies, but at last my\r\ndecision was understood and accepted by the people.\r\n\r\nWho knows better than I that the discipline displayed by the Italian\r\npeople has been worthy of my admiration and of the respect of the\r\nworld. We have no great natural resources. Nevertheless our citizens\r\nsubjected themselves to the pressure of taxation so thoroughly that\r\ntoward the end of 1924 minister De Stefani was able not only to\r\nannounce to the chamber the balancing of our budget, but also to\r\nforesee a surplus of one hundred and seventy millions for the fiscal\r\nyear 1925–26.\r\n\r\nI consider that the corner-stone of all governmental policies is a wise\r\nand strong financial policy. And now, supported by the soundness of the\r\nbudget, this policy was an accomplished fact. The state, through able\r\nadministration and the disciplined patience of Italian taxpayers, was\r\nable to face all its obligations, to liquidate its liabilities and,\r\nin 1925 and 1926, to discuss with Washington and London the complex\r\nproblems of war debts.\r\n\r\nWe were out of the hole.\r\n\r\nWe did not stop with the central government. The state, now\r\nself-assured, with its finances reordered, was able, by the\r\nstrength of its example, to give precise rules for the restoration of\r\nthe finances of the self-governing units in communes and provinces.\r\nBut even that was not enough; we had to review the financial situation\r\nof many a corporation and industry. Generally, this included all those\r\nindustries which were quoted on the stock exchange.\r\n\r\nBy one of those phenomena of national and international speculations,\r\nwhich are not infrequent in modern life, many of our industrial stocks\r\nand even government bonds had risen to figures which were hyperbolical\r\nand inconceivable, if one considered the relation that should exist\r\nbetween the value of our lira and its purchasing power in regard to\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nEven in Italy, a wise and honest country, in which excessive\r\nspeculation was never rampant, and in which the stock exchange was\r\nnever the object of excessive and unchecked interest from any class\r\nof citizens, there arose a madness for stock exchange gambling. Many\r\npeople, naturally, lost their heads. They shattered patrimonies, caused\r\nscandals, provoked bankruptcies; but this was not sufficient to stop\r\nthe sudden craze for speculation. The Minister of Finance then decided\r\nto take steps to watch and to limit the activities of the exchanges.\r\nIt was necessary to take really serious measures, which of course\r\nwould run counter to old and rooted business traditions. Perhaps\r\nthey were too sudden and too unexpected. They provoked in the middle\r\nand financial class an opposition which created a disturbance in all\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\nI was following the course of these events. This sudden opposition\r\ncreated by economic and not by political causes might, as was shown\r\nafterward, become a real danger, but it gave me a very important field\r\nfor experience and observations. I brought a counter offensive and\r\ntamed those who made the attacks. A more rational policy was instituted\r\nbut we conceded nothing to the speculators. After a while De Stefani\r\nresigned. Volpi succeeded him. In the meantime, after this first\r\ndifficulty had been dealt with, I concentrated my attention on the war\r\ndebts.\r\n\r\nAfter settling the state budget and balancing it, I knew that I had\r\ncome to the task of making an agreement with the United States of\r\nAmerica and with England on the reduction of our war debt. I sent\r\na delegation to Washington. The leaders were Count Volpi and the\r\nUndersecretary of Foreign Affairs, Grandi. I feel that the negotiations\r\nwere carried on with great ability. We arrived, I believe, at an\r\nagreement that satisfied the American public and safeguarded the\r\ninterests of Italy.\r\n\r\nOn January 27th, 1926, by an analogous agreement, with slight\r\nmodifications due to the different relations that existed between us\r\nand England, we were able to settle also our English debts. America and\r\nEngland ratified the agreements; and so did we, with pride, because it\r\nis our constant, firm rule, in all our private or public affairs, to\r\nkeep faith with our given word and to pay to our full ability the last\r\ncent we owe, without wailing or complaint.\r\n\r\nThen came a gesture of spontaneous national patriotism: our people\r\nby public subscription and without the help of the state paid the first\r\ninstallment due the government of the United States!\r\n\r\nI believed then that the security of the budget and the agreements of\r\nWashington and London would be sufficient evidence to reassure our\r\nindustrial, commercial and banking classes as to the soundness of the\r\nfinancial policy of the government. I hoped that it would lead to a\r\ngradual revaluation of all our currency and credit in national and\r\ninternational markets.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, all which appeared to me to grow out of convincing\r\nlogic did not follow. In the first six months of 1926, we were losing\r\nan average of ten points in relation to the pound. The pound sterling\r\nnaturally was towing all the other privileged currencies in such a way\r\nthat, at a time when our credit should have been on the upgrade, we\r\nwere witnessing an opposite phenomenon. Our private economic life was\r\ngetting thinner and less stable; it was becoming fickle and inconstant,\r\nthrough a gradual inflation which might delude many industrial centres\r\nof northern Italy, but was certainly not satisfying to the middle class\r\nand to the Italians who saved money.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to give a point of support to this gay finance. It was\r\ninconceivable that an orderly, quiet, disciplined state, which had no\r\npublic agitation as a liability and which worked with tenacity, faith\r\nand pride, should abandon these wholesome forces and assets to the\r\nmercy of shark speculators and parasites, eager to enrich themselves on\r\nthe depreciation of the lira, ready to accept willingly or even to\r\nquicken a general bankruptcy so as not to be obliged to settle their\r\nprivate debts, or to face their obligations toward depositors in their\r\nbanks. A betrayal of the Italian people was being plotted by a class\r\nof unworthy citizens. It was a serious betrayal and an injury to moral\r\ncharacter, because a ruined people cannot readily be born again in the\r\ncredit of the world.\r\n\r\nI studied for a long time the complex phenomenon of state, private, and\r\nindividual finance. I was making a comparison between our own economic\r\nphase and the situation of analogous countries. I was watching closely\r\nthe statistical data of our commercial balance. I had in my hand all\r\nthe evidence for a sure and positive judgment, and was ready to say the\r\nword which would influence, in a clear and decisive way, the economic\r\nlife of Italy.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that in August, 1926, in a square of a beautiful town\r\nof central Italy at Pesaro, I made a speech which was to become famous\r\nand which was destined to mark the beginning of the revaluation of the\r\nlira and our starting-point toward a gold basis.\r\n\r\nI had decided for some time to speak out with candor to the Italian\r\npeople. Foreign exchange had revealed a weakness in our credit abroad.\r\nInstability every day, under a régime of giddy and disastrous finance,\r\nwas a sign of underground work. I had to put speculation back to the\r\nwall with a slam. I had to face and defeat that part of a certain class\r\nwho would have pushed the nation toward bankruptcy. The government\r\ncould not ignore them or their machinations. It was not only a\r\nmatter touching the financial future of the country; the very flag\r\nof the Italian people was being jeopardized. In fact, in certain\r\nsituations, even the soundness of a currency can assume the dignity of\r\na flag and must be defended by every open means. One cannot entrench\r\noneself behind ignorance when the patrimony and the dignity of an\r\nentire people is being threatened.\r\n\r\nFascism, which had put discipline into the nation, had to put its firm\r\nhand on that class of short-sighted speculators who wanted to bring\r\nto nothing the value of our currency. Fascism, which had won on the\r\npolitical line, now faced, as I could well see, a defeat if it did not\r\nintervene energetically in the financial field.\r\n\r\nIn this plot against us were joined all the strength of the\r\ninternational anti-Fascists spurred and aroused by our eternal foes,\r\ninside Italy and out. I understood that combined with this problem of\r\nhonesty and rectitude, there was also a problem of will. So I spoke.\r\nHere is the essence of my speech:\r\n\r\n You must not be surprised if I make a political declaration of\r\n definite importance. It is not the first time that I have addressed to\r\n the people directly, without any official apparatus, my convictions\r\n and my decisions. I must always be trusted, but especially when I\r\n am speaking to the people, looking into its eyes and listening to\r\n the beating of its heart. I am speaking to you, but in this moment\r\n I am speaking to all Italians and my voice for obvious reasons will\r\n certainly have an echo behind the Alps, and overseas. Let me tell\r\n you that I will defend the Italian lira to the last gasp! I will\r\n never subject the marvellous Italian people, which for four\r\n years has worked with ascetic discipline, and is ready for other and\r\n harder sacrifices, to the moral shame and economic catastrophe of the\r\n bankruptcy of the lira.\r\n\r\n The Fascist régime will resist with all its strength the attempts\r\n to suffocate Italy being made by inimical financial forces. We will\r\n squash them as soon as they are identified at home. The lira, which\r\n is the sign of our economic life, the symbol of our long sacrifices\r\n and of our tenacious work, will be defended and it will be firmly\r\n defended—and at any cost! When I go among a people that really works,\r\n I feel that in speaking this way I interpret sincerely its sentiment,\r\n its hopes, and its will.\r\n\r\n Citizens and Black Shirts! I have already pronounced the most\r\n important part of my speech, destined to dissipate the fogs of\r\n uncertainty and to weaken the eventual attempts of troublesome\r\n defeatism.\r\n\r\nMy sentences were like whip-lashes for all the speculators hidden in\r\nthe bourses. The great financial institutions understood that it was\r\nnot possible to adopt independent policies without having to reckon\r\nwith the government. Speculators perceived that they had fallen into a\r\ntrap.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I did not want to confine myself to words. In the\r\ncouncil of the ministers on September first, I adopted measures which\r\nwere to guarantee my financial policies. These measures can be summed\r\nup: transfer of the Morgan loan of ninety millions of dollars to the\r\nBank of Italy; regularization of the accounts between the state and the\r\nBank of Italy; reduction of two billion, five hundred millions of the\r\ncirculation on account of the state; liquidation of the autonomistic\r\nsection of the Consorzio Valori.\r\n\r\nTo all this was to be added a broad simplification of taxation\r\nwith abolition of certain taxes and a new form of protection for thrift\r\nand for banking activities.\r\n\r\nIn November I floated a loan that I called “The Littorio.” It was\r\nintended to facilitate cash operations and to give some elasticity to\r\nthe budget. Since there was a very heavy floating debt, represented\r\nby treasury bonds, I decided upon redemption of these bonds and their\r\ninscription in the great book of the public debt. These provisions\r\nhad without doubt a harsh character; they were full of sacrifice. But\r\nwhen the moment and its discomfort had passed, we were able to start\r\non a policy of wise severity; our lira began to climb gradually on the\r\nmarkets of London and Washington and our credit rose again in every\r\npart of the world.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, the passage from a giddy to an austere finance which I had\r\ninaugurated with the Pesaro speech was not without its difficulties.\r\nFailures and heavy losses were brought about. Business deals begun\r\nwhile the lira was at one hundred and thirty to the pound were closed\r\nwith the lira at ninety. All this brought with it unavoidable losses\r\nwhich hit hardest those who were the least strong and resistant\r\nfinancially.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties in returning to a position of financial dignity and\r\nausterity were notable; reconstruction was as difficult as inflation\r\nhad been easy. We had to reduce the budget and state bonds to their\r\nsimplest expression; we had to start a policy of demobilization of our\r\ndebts to be able to know our complex financial burden and to determine\r\nexactly the interest that had to be paid every year.\r\n\r\nBut the situation has been cleared and bettered. In order to have\r\na sounder, readier, more agile organization, I had decided on the\r\nunification of all the institutions issuing paper money. Only the Bank\r\nof Italy has the power to issue paper money; the Bank of Naples and the\r\nBank of Sicily returned to their original functions of guardians and\r\nstimulators of the agricultural economic life of southern Italy.\r\n\r\nWhen, after a year of notable difficulties, the financial situation\r\nof the budget and of Italian economy had been cleared, I was able\r\nto address myself, in 1927, to the new gold basis of the lira, on\r\nconcrete foundations. In December, 1927, at a meeting of the council of\r\nministers, I was able to announce to the Italian people that the lira\r\nwas back on a gold basis, on a ratio which technicians and profound\r\nexperts in financial questions have judged sound.\r\n\r\nI felt the pride of a victor. I had not only led the Black Shirts and\r\npolitical forces, but I had solved a complex and difficult problem of\r\nnational finance, such a problem as sometimes withdraws itself beyond\r\nthe will and the influence of any political man, and becomes subjected\r\nto the tyranny and mechanism of mere material relations under the\r\ninfluence of various and infinite factors. Only a profound knowledge\r\nof the economic life and structure of a people can reach, in such an\r\ninsidious field, conclusions which will be able to satisfy the great\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nTo-day we have a balanced budget. Self-ruling units, the provinces\r\nand the communes, have balanced their budgets too. Exports and\r\nimports and their relationship are carried in a precise and definite\r\nrhythm—that of our stabilized lira. Through solidity and certainty,\r\nFascist Italy is creating a new Italian régime, while the necessary\r\ncomplement of our general policy and the essence of our state\r\norganization is being supplied by a new corporative system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                   THE FASCIST STATE AND THE FUTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nAmid the innovations and experiments of the new Fascist civilization,\r\nthere is one which is of interest to the whole world; it is the\r\ncorporative organization of the state.\r\n\r\nLet me assert at once that before we reached this form of state\r\norganization, one which I now consider rounded out, the steps we\r\ntook were long, and our research, analysis and discussion have been\r\nexhaustive. Both the experience and the tests have been full of lessons.\r\n\r\nPractical reality itself has been the navigator. First of all, we\r\nmust remember that the corporative organization was not born from a\r\ndesire to create mere juridical institutions; in my opinion, it grew\r\nout of the special necessities of the Italian situation in particular,\r\nand out of those necessities which would be general in any situation\r\nwhere there is economic restriction, and where traditions of work and\r\nproduction have not yet been developed by experience and time. Italy,\r\nin its first half-century of united political renaissance, has seen\r\nclasses armed one against the other, not only because of the desire\r\nof one to master the other in political control but also because of\r\nthe struggle for the limited resources that our surface soil and what\r\nwas beneath it might be put at the disposition of those who were\r\ninterested in work and production.\r\n\r\nOpposed to the directing middle class, there was another class which I\r\nwill call, for more easy reference, proletarian. It was influenced by\r\nSocialists and anarchists, in an eternal and never-ending struggle with\r\nthe directing class.\r\n\r\nEvery year there was a general strike; every year the fertile Po\r\nValley, for instance, was subjected to recurring agitations which\r\nimperiled crops and all production. Opposed to that humane sense of\r\nharmony which should be a duty upon citizens of the same Fatherland,\r\nthere was a chronic struggle of interests, egged on by the professional\r\nSocialists, the syndicalist organizers, a struggle against a middle\r\nclass which, in turn, persisted in its position of negation and of\r\nexpectation of a messiah. Civil life did not move a decisive step\r\nforward on the way toward betterment.\r\n\r\nA country like ours, which has no rich resources in the earth, which\r\nhas mountains for half of its area, cannot have great economic\r\npossibilities. If, then, the citizens become naturally quarrelsome,\r\nif classes have a tendency to strive to annihilate each other, civil\r\nlife can have none of that rhythm necessary for developing a modern\r\npeople. The Liberal and Democratic state, in spite of upheavals,\r\nrecurrent every year, and even at every season, held to a noncommital\r\nstand, selecting a characteristic slogan: “Neither reaction, nor\r\nrevolution,”—as if that phrase had a precise or, indeed, any meaning\r\nwhatsoever!\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to emerge from the base, clannish habit of\r\nclass competition and to put aside hates and enmities. After the war,\r\nespecially following the subversive propaganda of Lenin, ill-will had\r\nreached perilous proportions. Agitations and strikes usually were\r\naccompanied by fights, with dead and wounded men as the result. The\r\npeople went back to work with souls full of hate against the class of\r\nthe masters, which, rightly or wrongly, was considered so idiotically\r\nlacking in vision as to surpass in this regard any other middle class\r\nin the world. Between the peasants and the rising industry of the urban\r\ncentres there were also the phenomena of unmistakable misunderstanding.\r\nAll of our life was dominated by demagogy. Every one was disposed to\r\ntolerate, to pretend to understand, to make concessions to the violence\r\nof the crowd. But after every incident of disorder, some new situation\r\npromised another and even more difficult problem of conflict.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary, in my opinion, to create a political atmosphere which\r\nwould allow men in government to have some degree of courage, to speak\r\nharsh truths, to affirm rights, only after having exacted duties, and,\r\nif necessary, imposing these duties. Liberalism and Democracy were\r\nonly attempted remedies of milk-and-water character; they exhausted\r\ntheir energies in the halls of parliament. Leading that agitation\r\nwere employees of the state, railroad men and postmen and troublesome\r\nelements. The authority of the state was a kitten handled to death. In\r\nsuch a situation, mere pity and tolerance would have been criminal.\r\nLiberalism and Democracy, which had abdicated their duty at every\r\nturn, failed utterly to appraise and adjust the rights and duties of\r\nthe various classes in Italian life. Fascism has done it!\r\n\r\nThe fact is that five years of harmonious work have transformed in its\r\nvery essentials the economic life and, in consequence, the political\r\nand moral life of Italy. Let me add that the discipline that I have\r\nimposed is not a forced discipline; it is not born from preconceived\r\nideas, does not obey the selfish interests of groups and of classes.\r\nOur discipline has one vision and one end—the welfare and the good name\r\nof the Italian nation.\r\n\r\nThe discipline that I have imposed is enlightened discipline. The\r\nhumble classes, because they are more numerous and perhaps more\r\ndeserving of solicitude, are nearest to my heart as a responsible\r\nleader. I have seen the men from the countryside in the trenches,\r\nand I have understood how much the nation owes to the healthy people\r\nof calloused hands. On the other hand, our industrial workers have\r\nqualities of sobriety, geniality, stamina, which feed the pride of\r\none who must rule and lead a people. The middle Italian class, too,\r\nincluding the rural class, is much better than its reputation. Our\r\nproblems arise from a variety and diversity among the various economic\r\ninterests, which makes difficult the formation of great national groups\r\nof producers. None of the Italian producing groups, however, can be\r\nrated as “vampires,” as they were rated in the superficial terminology\r\nof the old Socialist demagogy. The state is no longer ignorant when it\r\nconfronts facts and the interests of the various classes. Not only\r\ndoes it obviate strife—it tries to find out the origins of clashes and\r\nconflicts. By statistics and the help of studious men, we now are able\r\nto define what will be the great issues of to-morrow. In the meantime,\r\nwith the aid not only of the government, but of the bodies locally\r\norganized for consultation, we can know precisely what are to be the\r\noutlines of the productive programmes of to-morrow.\r\n\r\nI have wanted the Fascist government, above all, to give great care\r\nto the social legislation needed to carry out our part of agreed\r\ninternational programmes for industry and for those who bear the future\r\nof industry. I think that Italy is advanced beyond all the European\r\nnations; in fact, it has ratified the laws for the eight-hour day, for\r\nobligatory insurance, for regulation of the work of women and children,\r\nfor assistance and benefit, for after-work diversion and adult\r\neducation, and finally for obligatory insurance against tuberculosis.\r\nAll this shows how, in every detail in the field of labor, I stand by\r\nthe Italian working classes. All that it was possible to do without\r\nworking an injury to the principle of solidity in our economy I have\r\nset out to do, from the minimum wage to the continuity of employment,\r\nfrom insurance against accidents to indemnity against illness, from\r\nold age pensions to the proper regulation of military service. There\r\nis little which social welfare research has adjudged practical to\r\nnational economy or wise for social happiness which has not already\r\nbeen advanced by me. I want to give to every man and woman so generous\r\nan opportunity that work will be not a painful necessity but a joy\r\nof life. But even such a complex programme cannot be said to equal the\r\ncreation of the corporative system. Nor can the latter equal something\r\neven larger. Beyond the corporative system, beyond the state’s labors,\r\nis Fascism, harmonizer and dominator of Italian life, standing ever as\r\nits inspiration.\r\n\r\nIn 1923, some months after the march on Rome, I insisted on the\r\nratification of the law for an eight-hour day. All the masses which had\r\nseen a friend in the legislative policy of Fascism gave their approval\r\nto national syndicalism. Instead of the old professional syndicates we\r\nsubstituted Fascist corporations. In a meeting of December 19, 1923,\r\nI had occasion to affirm that: “Peace within is primarily a task of\r\ngovernment. The government has a clear outline of conduct. Public\r\norder must never be troubled for any reason whatsoever. That is the\r\npolitical side. But there is also the economic side; it is one of\r\ncollaboration. There are other problems, such as that of exportation. I\r\nremind Italian industry of these principles. Until now it has been too\r\nindividualistic. The old system and old ways must be abandoned.”\r\n\r\nA little further on I said: “Over all conflicts of human and legitimate\r\ninterests, there is the authority of the government; the government\r\nalone is in the right position to see things from the point of view\r\nof the general welfare. This government is not at the disposition of\r\nthis man or that man; it is over everybody, because it takes to itself\r\nnot only the juridical conscience of the nation in the present,\r\nbut also all that the nation represents for the future. The government\r\nhas shown that it values at the highest the productive strength of the\r\nnation. A government which follows these principles has the right to\r\nbe listened to by every one. It has a task to fulfill. It will do it.\r\nIt will do it inexorably for the defense of the moral and material\r\ninterests of the nation.”\r\n\r\nLittle by little, the old labor structure and associations were\r\nabandoned. We were directed more and more toward the corporative\r\nconception of the state. I did not want to take away from labor one of\r\nits holidays, and so, instead of the first of May, which had foreign\r\norigins and the imprint of Socialist internationalism, I fixed on a gay\r\nand glorious date in Italian life, April 21st, the birthday of Rome.\r\nRome is the city which has given legislation to the world. The Roman\r\nlaw is still the text which governs the relations of civil life. To\r\ncelebrate a Labor Day, I could not have selected a more suggestive and\r\nworthy date.\r\n\r\nTo bring into being, in a precise co-ordination, all the measures that\r\nI had undertaken and that Fascism and the Corporations had brought\r\nabout, in all their complexity, I had the Grand Council approve\r\na document. I do not hesitate to declare it to be of historical\r\ncharacter: it is the Labor Charter.\r\n\r\nIt is composed of thirty paragraphs, each of which contains a\r\nfundamental truth. From the paramount necessity for production arises\r\nthe need of an equitable sharing of products, the need of the judgment\r\nof tribunals in case of discord, and, finally, the need of\r\nprotective legislation.\r\n\r\nThat document has been welcomed by all the classes of Italy. The labor\r\nmagistracy represents, in its consecration to duty, something worthy\r\nof a strong state, in contrast to the cloudy aspirations in the misty\r\nrealms of high-sounding Liberalism, Democracy and communistic fantasy.\r\nThe framing and realization were the tasks of Fascism. Old men of the\r\nsocialist and syndicalist poses and postures were amazed and perplexed\r\nat the daring new reform. Another legend fell: Fascism was not the\r\nprotector of any one class, but a supreme regulator of the relations\r\nbetween all citizens of a state. The Labor Charter found interpreters\r\nand attracted the attention of the studious in every part of the world.\r\nIt became a formidable pillar of the new constitution of the Fascist\r\nState.\r\n\r\nAs a logical consequence of the Charter of Labor and of all the social\r\nlegislation and of the magistracy of labor, came the necessity of\r\ninstituting the Corporations. In this institution are concentrated\r\nall the branches of national production. Work in all its complex\r\nmanifestations and in all its breadth, whether of manual or of\r\nintellectual nature, requires equally protection and nourishment. The\r\ncitizen in the Fascist State is no longer a selfish individual who has\r\nthe anti-social right of rebelling against any law of the Collectivity.\r\nThe Fascist State with its corporative conception puts men and their\r\npossibilities into productive work and interprets for them the duties\r\nthey have to fulfil.\r\n\r\nIn this new conception, which has found its logical expression\r\nin our representative forms, the citizen is valuable because of his\r\nproductivity, his work and his thought, and not merely because he is\r\ntwenty-one years old and has the right to vote!\r\n\r\nIn the corporative state all national activities are reflected. It was\r\nlogical that syndicalistic organizations should become a part also of\r\nthe new representative institutions. From this need, imposed by a new\r\npolitical and social reality, arose the reform of national political\r\nrepresentation. Not only does the new political directorate select its\r\ncandidates with regard for their capabilities and for the number of\r\ncitizens represented, but it is complemented by the work of selection\r\nand valuation devoted by the Grand Fascist Council to the task of\r\ncreating the best, the most stable, the most truly representative and\r\nthe most expert national board of directors.\r\n\r\nWe have solved a series of problems of no little extent and importance;\r\nwe have abolished all those perennial troubles and disorders and\r\ndoubts that poisoned our national soul. We have given rhythm, law, and\r\nprotection to Work: we have found in the co-operation of classes the\r\nevidence of our possibilities, of our future power. We do not waste\r\ntime in brawls and strikes, which, while they vex the spirit, imperil\r\nour strength and the solidity of our economy. We regard strife as a\r\nluxury for the rich. We must conserve our strength. We have exalted\r\nwork as productive strength; therefore we have the majority of these\r\nelements represented in the legislative body, and this body is a\r\nmore worthy and a stronger helmsman for Italian life.\r\n\r\nAnd Capital is not exiled, as in the Russian communistic dream; we\r\nconsider it an increasingly important actor in the drama of production.\r\n\r\n                            * * * * *\r\n\r\nIn this, my Autobiography, I have emphasized more than once the fact\r\nthat I have always tried to weave an organic and coherent character\r\ninto all the fabric of my political work. I have not confined myself to\r\ngiving merely an outward veneer or contour to Italian life; I wished\r\nto influence the very depths of its spirit. I founded my work on facts\r\nand on the real conditions of the Italian people; from such realistic\r\nactivity I drew valuable lessons. I have been able to bring about\r\nuseful, immediate results looking toward a new future for our country.\r\n\r\nOne of the reforms which I have promoted and have closely followed in\r\nall its successive developments is the reorganization of the schools.\r\nThis has been called the Gentile Reform, after the name of the Minister\r\nof Public Instruction, whom I appointed immediately following the March\r\non Rome. The gravity and importance of school problems cannot escape\r\nthe attention of any modern statesman mindful of the destiny of his\r\npeople. The School must be considered in all its complete expression.\r\nPublic schools, Intermediate schools, University institutions, all\r\nexercise a profound influence on the trend—both moral and economic—of\r\nthe life of any nation. From the beginning this has been ever in my\r\nmind. Perhaps my early experience as a school teacher increased\r\nan unvarying interest in youth and its development. In Italy there\r\nwere traditions of higher culture, but the public schools had become\r\ndegraded because of lack of means and, above all, because of lack of\r\nspiritual vision.\r\n\r\nAlthough the percentage of illiteracy tended to diminish and even to\r\ndisappear in certain regions, particularly in Piedmont, the citizens\r\nnevertheless were not getting from the school world those broad\r\neducational foundations—physical, intellectual and moral—that are\r\npossible and humane. The intermediate schools were too crowded because\r\neverybody was admitted, even those without merit, through endless\r\nsessions of examinations which were reduced often to a spiritless\r\nformality. We lacked intelligent systems of selection and vocational\r\nand educational valuation of individuals. The mill ground on and on,\r\nturning out stock patterns of human beings who ended for the most part\r\nby taking tasks in bureaucracy. They lowered the function of the public\r\nservice by dead and not living personnel. Universities created other\r\npuppets in the so-called “free arts,” such as law and medicine.\r\n\r\nI t was time that the delicate machinery which was of such consequence\r\nin the spiritual life of the nation be renewed in a precise, definite,\r\norganic form. We had to crowd out from the intermediate schools the\r\nnegative and supercilious elements. We were determined to infuse into\r\nthe public schools those broad humanistic currents in which our history\r\nand our traditions are so rich. Finally, it was indispensable to\r\nimpose a new discipline in education—a discipline to which every one\r\nmust submit, the teachers themselves first of all!\r\n\r\nTo be sure, teachers draw a very modest wage in Italy, and this is a\r\nproblem that I am resolved to face and solve as soon as the condition\r\nof the budget will allow. Nevertheless, I cannot permit a limited,\r\npinch-penny treatment of education. The niggardly policy is of old\r\nand typically Liberal and Democratic origin. It furnished teachers\r\nwith a good pretext for performing their duties indifferently and for\r\nabandoning themselves to subversive thought, even against the state\r\nitself. This condition reached its climax in the humiliating fact that\r\nmany teachers deserted their posts. We had had clamorous examples of\r\nsuch a tendency, not only in the elementary schools, but also in some\r\nof the universities.\r\n\r\nFascism put a stop to all this by making discipline supreme, discipline\r\nboth for the high and for the low, particularly for those who had the\r\nhigh duty of teaching order and discipline and of maintaining the\r\nhighest concepts of human service in the various schools of the régime.\r\n\r\nWe had an old school law which took its name from Minister Casati, a\r\nlaw that had been enacted in 1859 and had remained the fundamental law\r\neven after the successive retouching of Ministers Coppino, Daneo, and\r\nCredaro. We had to renew and refashion it, through the ardent will of\r\nour Party; we had to give it a broad didactic and moral vision; we\r\nhad to infuse into it a spirit of vital rebirth which would appeal to\r\nthe new Italy. Great ideas and great revolutions always create\r\nthe right hour for the solution of many problems. The school problem,\r\nwhich had dragged on for many decades, has finally found its solution\r\nin the Gentile Reform. This is not the place to explain the reform in\r\ndetail. I want to indicate, however, those fundamental principles which\r\nI myself discussed and settled in a few compact discussions with the\r\nMinister of Public Instruction. They can be summarized by the following\r\npoints:\r\n\r\n1st—The state provides schooling only for those who deserve it because\r\nof their merits and leaves to other initiatives students who are not\r\nentitled to a place in the state’s schools.\r\n\r\nThis throws on the scrap heap the democratic concept which considered\r\na state school as an institution for every one—a basket into which\r\ntreasure and waste were piled together. The middle class had regarded\r\nthe school as at its service and therefore did not respect it. They\r\ndemanded only the greatest possible indulgence in order to achieve as\r\nquickly as they could their purely utilitarian aims, such as a degree\r\nor a perfunctory passing to promotions.\r\n\r\n2nd—The students of the state schools and of the independent schools\r\nfind themselves under equal conditions when taking the state\r\nexaminations, before committees appointed by the government.\r\n\r\nThus is encouraged the régime of independent schools analogous to those\r\nof England. This régime is advantageous for the Catholics, owners of\r\nmany schools, but displeases the anti-clericals of the old style.\r\nIt allows me a free development of scholastic initiative outside of the\r\nconventional lines.\r\n\r\n3rd—The state watches over the independent schools and promotes a\r\nrivalry between independent and state schools which raises the cultural\r\nlevel and the general atmosphere of all schools.\r\n\r\nThe state does not see its jurisdiction diminished because of the\r\nindependent schools; on the contrary, it extends its watchfulness over\r\nall schools.\r\n\r\n4th—Admission to the intermediate schools is now possible only through\r\nexaminations. The schools are directed toward a broad humanistic\r\nculture, but with a standard of scholarship which has eliminated\r\nforever the disorder and the easy-going ways of the old democratic\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nBy means of these and other reforms the elementary school comes to have\r\ntwo distinct but co-ordinated purposes. One is that of preparation for\r\nthe intermediate schools, and the other is a high type of broad popular\r\neducation complete in itself.\r\n\r\nThe intermediate schools were broadened by means of the following\r\ninstitutions:\r\n\r\n(a) _Complementary schools._ The abolished technical school, complete\r\nin itself, was revived along new lines.\r\n\r\n(b) _Technical institutes_ of higher specialization.\r\n\r\n(c) _Scientific Lyceum_, still higher, taking the place of the\r\nabolished “Modern Lyceum” and of the Physico-Mathematical departments\r\nof the Technical Institute, and preparing the students for the\r\nscientific branches of the University.\r\n\r\n(d) _Teachers’ Institute_, a purely humanistic and philosophical\r\nschool taking the place of the abolished complementary and normal\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n(e) _Women’s Lyceum_, a general culture school, complete in itself.\r\n\r\n(f) _Classical Lyceum_, unchanged in its essential lines, but\r\naugmented by the humanistic character of the studies; to it the task\r\nof preparing for most university branches has been assigned. To enter\r\nthe universities, entrance examinations have been instituted. The\r\nfinal examinations of the intermediate schools, of the Classical and\r\nthe Scientific Lyceum, have been termed Maturity Examinations; all the\r\ncurricula have been renewed, fitting them for a more modern culture.\r\nLatin has been restored in all schools except in the Complementary and\r\nReligious Departments of the elementary and intermediate schools.\r\n\r\nFor all these different types of institutions, one essential\r\nrule has been put into practice, that is, every school must be a\r\n_unit organism_, with a set number of classes and students; the\r\ncandidates may enter through a graduated classification, based on the\r\nexaminations; those who are not admitted must go to independent schools.\r\n\r\nThe application of this reform, which overthrew the old interests, the\r\nold ideas and especially the utilitarian spirit of the population,\r\naroused an unavoidable spirit of ill-feeling. It was used by the\r\nopposition press, especially by the _Corriere della Sera_, for\r\ncontroversial purposes; but the reform has been put through with energy\r\nunder my direction and has marked the beginning of a real rebirth\r\nof the Italian schools and of the Italian culture.\r\n\r\nThe reform of the universities has been co-ordinated with the reforms\r\nin the primary and intermediate schools. Its purpose is to divide\r\nthe university students into different organic institutions, without\r\nuseless overlapping. The rule of state examinations is imposed also\r\nfor the universities, to which both the students of the state and\r\nindependent schools can be admitted. The Institute of “Libera Docenza,”\r\nauthorities independently attached to certain faculties of the\r\nuniversities, has also been reformed, appointment no longer being made\r\nby the individual departments but by central committees in Rome.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of a visit by the delegations of the Fascist university\r\ngroups, I had the opportunity of declaring that the Gentile Reform\r\n“is the most revolutionary of all the reforms which we have voted on,\r\nbecause it has completely transformed a state of affairs which had\r\nlasted since 1859.”\r\n\r\nI was the son of a school-mistress; I myself was taught in the\r\nelementary and secondary schools. I knew, therefore, the school\r\nproblem. Because of that, I had wanted to bring it to a concrete\r\nconclusion. The Italian school again will take its deserved place in\r\nthe world. From our university chairs, true scientists and poets will\r\nagain illuminate Italian thought, while the secondary schools will\r\nprovide technical and executive elements for our population, and the\r\npublic schools will create a background of civic education and\r\ncollective virtue in the masses.\r\n\r\nI have willed that, in collaboration with the universities, departments\r\nof Fascist economics, of corporative law, and a whole series of\r\nfruitful institutes of Fascist culture, should be created. Thus a\r\npurely scholastic and academic world is being permeated by Fascism,\r\nwhich is creating a new culture through the fervid and complex activity\r\nof real, of theoretical and of spiritual experiences.\r\n\r\nBut, even closer to my heart than the Institutes of Fascist\r\nuniversities, is a new institution which has all the original marks of\r\nthe Fascist revolution. It is the National Organization of Balilla.\r\nUnder the name of a legendary little Genoese hero the new generation\r\nof children and of youth was organized. These no longer depend, as in\r\nthe past, upon various playground associations, scattered political\r\nschools and accessory institutions, but are trained through rigid but\r\ngay discipline in gymnastic exercises and in the general rules of a\r\nwell-ordered national life. They are accustomed to obedience and they\r\nare made to see a sure vision of the future.\r\n\r\nTo show the importance that educational revival has in my mind, I\r\nmyself gave a lecture at the University of Perugia. It has been\r\npronounced by scholars as a broadening of the world’s concept of its\r\nduty to youth.\r\n\r\nFinally, to pay a tribute to culture and to higher culture, and to\r\nevery one who, in the field of science, art, and letters, has held\r\nhigh the name of Italy, I have created an Italian Academy, with a\r\nmembership of “immortals.”\r\n\r\n                            * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe armed forces of the state had fallen into degradation in the\r\nyears 1919, 1920, 1921. The flower of our race had been spurned and\r\nhumiliated.\r\n\r\nConditions even reached a point where the Minister of War in those\r\n“liberal” days had a circular distributed advising officers not to\r\nappear in uniform in public, and to refrain from carrying arms, in\r\norder not to be subjected to the challenges of gangsters and hoodlums.\r\n\r\nThis aberration, which it is better to pass over quickly for the sake\r\nof one’s country, was destined to find its avenger in Fascism. It was\r\none of the factors which created an atmosphere passionately eager for\r\nchange. To-day, the spirit of the country is much different; to-day the\r\narmed forces of the state are justly considered the secure and worthy\r\nand honored defense of the nation.\r\n\r\nI had a very clear and decisive programme, when, in 1922, at the moment\r\nof the March on Rome, I selected as my collaborators the best leaders\r\nof the Victory of 1918. General Armando Diaz, who after Vittorio Veneto\r\nhad remained aloof in silence, overwhelmed by the difficulty of the\r\nmoment, and who had issued and had been able to voice an indignant\r\nprotest in the Senate against the policies of Nitti’s Cabinet, had been\r\nselected by me as Minister of War. I ♦appointed Admiral Thaon de Revel,\r\nthe greatest leader of our war on the sea, as Minister of the Navy. On\r\nJanuary 5, 1923, General Diaz presented a complete programme of\r\nreform for the army to the Council of Ministers. That was an historic\r\nmeeting; fundamental decisions for the renewal of the armed forces\r\nwere taken; and we were able to announce to the country in solemn and\r\nexplicit fashion that, with that meeting, the army had been given new\r\nlife, to “accomplish the high mission that had been intrusted to it, in\r\nthe supreme interests of the nation.”\r\n\r\n♦ “appoined” replaced with “appointed”\r\n\r\nI had fulfilled the first promise I had made to myself and to the\r\nItalian people. Immediately after that I dedicated myself to a\r\nreorganization of aviation, which had been abandoned to utter decay\r\nby the former administrations. The task was not easy; everything\r\nhad to be done again. The landing fields, the machines, the pilots,\r\nthe organizers and the technicians all were restored. A feeling of\r\nabandonment, of dejection and mistrust had been diffused in Italy by\r\nthe enemies of aviation; this new type of armed force, many people\r\nthought, should be developed only as a sport. Into this situation I\r\nput my energy—I gave it personal attention, personal devotion. I have\r\nsucceeded in my purpose: the successes of De Pinedo, of Maddalena,\r\nthe flights in squadrons, the great manœuvers, have demonstrated that\r\nItalian aviation has recently acquired great expertness and prestige,\r\nnot only in Italy, but wherever there is air to fly in.\r\n\r\nThe same can be said of the navy, which has reordered its formation,\r\nbettered its units, completed its fleet, and made its discipline\r\nefficient. Fourth, but not least, because of its spirit of emulation\r\nand daring, comes the Voluntary Militia for the Safety of the Nation,\r\ndivided into 160 Legions, commanded by distinguished officers and by\r\nenthusiastic Fascists. These are magnificent shock troops.\r\n\r\nFinally our barracks and our ships can be said to be, in the true sense\r\nof the word, refuges of peace and strength; the officers devote their\r\nactivities to the physical and educational betterment of the men; the\r\ntraining conforms to the modern technic of war. The army is no longer\r\ndistracted from its functions, as happened too often under the old\r\ngovernments, in order to assume ordinary duties of public order which\r\nwere exhausting and humiliating, and to which entire Divisions were\r\nassigned. I changed all this. For the last five years, the army has\r\nleft its barracks for its tactical manœuvers and for no other reason.\r\n\r\nAfter some time, General Diaz had been obliged to resign on account of\r\nthe condition of his health. General Di Giorgio commanded _ad interim_.\r\nBut later I saw clearly the necessity of gathering all the armed\r\nforces of the state under one direction. I assumed the portfolios of\r\nWar, Navy and Aeronautics. Thanks to this programme, I have created a\r\ncommander-in-chief of all general staffs, who has the task of shaping,\r\nwith a complete vision of ensemble, all the plans of the various\r\nbranches of our forces toward one end: Victory. Our military spirit is\r\nlively; it is not aggressive, but it will not be taken by surprise. It\r\nis a peaceful spirit, but it is watchful.\r\n\r\n                            * * * * *\r\n\r\nTo complete the Fascist revival, it was necessary to keep in mind\r\nalso several lesser problems which, for the sake of the dignity\r\nand strength of the life of the nation, were in need of an immediate\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nThe retired employees of the government, who received very small\r\npensions before the war, had seen with alarm the value of their already\r\nmeager resources diminish because of the successive depreciations of\r\nthe currency. I had to make a provision of some exceptional nature\r\nfor their protection, by making their pensions adequate to the\r\nnecessities of the day and to the current value of money. I made a\r\nprovision favoring the clergy also; it was a question of a just and\r\nnecessary disposition. This would have been inconceivable in the days\r\nof the Masonic demagogy and social democracy, which was dominated by\r\na superficial and wrathful anti-clericalism. Our clergy number about\r\n60,000 in Italy. They are extraneous to the controversy, which I may\r\ncall historical, between State and Church. They accomplish a wise\r\ntask and assist the Italian people in all their religious practices,\r\nwithout meddling with political questions, especially since the rise of\r\nFascism. They are reluctant to debase the spiritual character of their\r\nmission. The intriguing priest, of course, has to be fought. Instead,\r\nthe priest who accomplishes his task according to the wise rules of the\r\nGospel and shows the people the great humane and divine truths, will be\r\nhelped and assisted. Because many of them were living in poverty, we\r\ntook general measures to better the conditions of their existence.\r\n\r\n                            * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe policy in regard to public works in Italy had always had an\r\nelectoral tinge; public works to be done were decided upon\r\nhere and there, not according to an organic plan or to any plain\r\nnecessity, but to give sporadic satisfaction to this or that group\r\nof voters. I stopped this legalized favoritism. I instituted Bureaus\r\nof Public Works, intrusting them to persons in whom I have complete\r\nconfidence, who obey only the central power of the state, and are\r\nimmune from pressure by local interests. In this way I was able to\r\nbetter appreciably the conditions of the roads of the South; I mapped\r\nout a programme for aqueducts, railroads and ports. All that is just\r\nfinds in the Italian bureaucracy an immediate comprehension. All the\r\noffices of governmental character have received a new impulse and new\r\nprestige. The great public utilities of the state, railroads, mails,\r\ntelegraph, telephone, the monopolies, function again. Certain persons\r\nare even sarcastic about the new regularity. And this is easily\r\nexplained: we should not forget that the Italian people has been for\r\nmany years rebellious against any discipline; it was accustomed to\r\nuse its easy-to-hand and clamorous complaints against the work and\r\nactivity of the government. Some vestiges of the mental attitudes of\r\nbygone days still come to the surface. There is even whining because\r\nthere is efficiency and order in the world. Certain individualistic\r\nambitions would like to slap at our strong achievements of discipline\r\nand regularity. But to-day the state is not an abstract and unknowing\r\nentity; the government is present everywhere, every day. He who lives\r\nin the ambit of the state or outside the state feels in every way the\r\nmajesty of law. It is not a thing of small moment that all public\r\nutilities are conducted with an efficiency which I might call American,\r\nand that the Italian bureaucracy, proverbially slow, has become eager\r\nand agile.\r\n\r\nI have given particular attention to the Capital. Rome is a universal\r\ncity, dear to the heart of Italians and of the whole world. It was\r\ngreat in the time of the Roman Empire and has conserved a universal\r\nlight. It was the historical seat and the centre of diffusion of\r\nChristianity. Rome is first of all a city with the aura of destiny\r\nand history. It is the Capital of the New Italy. It is the seat of\r\nChristianity. It has taught and will continue to teach law and art to\r\nthe whole world.\r\n\r\nI could not refuse the resources necessary to make this magnificent\r\ncapital a city æsthetically beautiful, politically ordered, and\r\ndisciplined by a governor. With its natural port of Ostia, with its\r\nnew roads, it will become one of the most orderly and clean cities\r\nof Europe. By isolating the monuments of ancient Rome, the relation\r\nbetween the ancient Romans and the Italians is made more beautiful and\r\nsuggestive. This work of revaluation—almost recreation—of the capital\r\nwas not carried on to the detriment of other Italian cities. Each one\r\nof them has the typical character of an ancient capital. They are\r\ncities like Perugia, Milan, Naples, Florence, Palermo, Bologna, Turin,\r\nGenoa, which have had a sovereign history worthy of high respect; but\r\nnone of them thinks now to contest with Rome and its eternal glory.\r\n\r\n                            * * * * *\r\n\r\nSome writers who, as keen observers, have followed point by point\r\nthe vicissitudes of our political life at a certain moment raised an\r\ninteresting question. Why did not the National Fascist Party decree its\r\nown disbandment or slip into disorganization after the revolutionary\r\nvictory of October, 1922?\r\n\r\nIn order to answer this question it is necessary to bring into relief\r\ncertain essential points. History teaches us that, normally, a\r\nrevolutionary movement can be channelled into legality only by means of\r\nforceful provisions, directed, if necessary, against even the personnel\r\nof the movement. Every revolution assumes unforeseen and complex\r\naspects; in certain historical hours, the sacrifice of those who were\r\nthe well-deserving lieutenants of yesterday might become indispensable\r\nfor the supreme interest of to-morrow. Nevertheless, in my own life I\r\nhave never deliberately desired the sacrifice of any one; therefore\r\nI have made use of the high influence which I have always had over\r\nmy followers to stop stagnation or heresies, personal interests and\r\ncontentions; I have preferred to prevent rather than to repress.\r\n\r\nBut, when it has been necessary, I have shown myself to be inexorable.\r\nIn fact, I had to keep in mind that, when one party has shouldered\r\nthe responsibility of entire power, it has to know how to perform\r\nsurgery—and major operations, too—against secession. Because of my\r\npersonal situation, having created the Party, I have always dominated\r\nit. The sporadic cases of secession, due not to differences of method\r\nbut to personal temperament, usually withered under the general\r\nloss of esteem and interest, and after the disclosure of selfish\r\nends.\r\n\r\nThis consciousness of my incontestable domination has given me the\r\nability to make the Party live on. But other considerations also were\r\nopposed to the disbandment of the Party. First of all, a sentimental\r\nmotif had stamped itself upon my soul and upon the grateful spirit of\r\nthe nation. The Fascisti, particularly the young, had followed me with\r\nblind, absolute, and profound devotion. I had led them through the most\r\ndramatic vicissitudes, taking them away from universities, from jobs,\r\nfrom factories. The young men had not hesitated when confronted by\r\ndanger. They had known how to risk their future positions together with\r\ntheir lives and fortunes. I owed and still owe to the militiamen of\r\nprevious days my strongest gratitude; to disband the Party and retire\r\nwould have been first of all an act of utter ingratitude.\r\n\r\nThere was in the end a much more important reason. I considered\r\nthe formulation of a new Italian method of government as one of\r\nthe principal duties of Fascism. It was to be created by the vigor\r\nof labor, through a well-tested process of selection, without the\r\nrisky creation of too many improvised military leaders. It was the\r\nParty’s right to offer me men of our own régime to assume positions\r\nof responsibility. In that sense the Party was side by side with the\r\ngovernment in the ruling of the new régime. It had to abandon the\r\nprogramme of violent struggle and yet preserve intact its character\r\nof proud political intransigentism. Many obvious signs made me\r\nunderstand that it was not possible to patch the old with the new\r\nworld. I had therefore need of reserves of men for the future. The\r\nChief of the government could very well be the Chief of the Party, just\r\nas in every country of the world a representative chief is always the\r\nexponent of an aristocracy of wills.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, to mark a point fundamental for the public order, my\r\ngovernment, in December, 1922, issued an admonition to the Fascists\r\nthemselves. It was in the following terms:\r\n\r\n“Every Fascist must be a guardian of order. Every disturber is an enemy\r\neven if he carries in his pocket the identification card of the Party.”\r\n\r\nThus, in a few words, were the position and the duty of the Party in\r\nthe life of the Fascist régime indicated.\r\n\r\nWe encountered plenty of pitfalls and snares in 1922. The Party had\r\nreached a peculiar sensitiveness, through its intense experience. In\r\nthe moment of its hardest test, it had shown itself to be equipped to\r\nguide the interests of the country as a whole. The revolution had not\r\nhad long, bloody consequences, as in other revolutions, except for the\r\nmoment of battle. Violence, as I have said before, had been controlled\r\nby my will.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the position of some opposing newspapers was strange\r\nindeed. Those of the _Corriere della Sera_, of Liberal-Democratic\r\ncoloring, and that of the _Avanti_, Socialist, agreed—strange\r\nbed-fellows!—in harshly criticising the simultaneous and violent\r\naction of Fascism, while they were wishing in their hearts and\r\nwriting that the Fascist experiment would soon be finished.\r\nAccording to these political diagnosticians, it was a matter of an\r\nexperiment of short duration, in which Fascism would be destroyed\r\neither on the parliamentary rocks or by an obvious inadequacy to direct\r\nthe complexities of Italian life. We saw later the wretched end of\r\nthese prophets; but to attain results it had been necessary for me,\r\nparticularly in the first year, continually to watch the Party. It had\r\nalways to remain in perfect efficiency, superior to opposing critics\r\nand to snares, ready for orders and commands.\r\n\r\nOne grave danger was threatening the Party: it was the too free\r\nadmission of new elements. Our small handfuls in the warlike beginnings\r\nwere now growing to excess, so much so that it was necessary to put a\r\npadlock on the door to prevent the influx of further membership. Once\r\nthe solidity of Fascism had been proved, all the old world wanted to\r\nrush into its ranks. If this had happened, we would have come back\r\nto the old mentality, the old defects, by overhasty adulteration\r\ninstead of keeping our growth selective through education and\r\ndevotion. Otherwise the Party, augmented by all the opportunists of\r\nthe eleventh hour, would have lost its vibrating and original soul. A\r\ncheck had to be placed upon the old world. It could go and wait with\r\nits bed-slippers on, without spoiling a movement of young people for\r\nItalian rebirth.\r\n\r\nAfter I had closed, in 1926, the registration in the Party, I used\r\nall my force, care and means for the selection and the education\r\nof Youth. The Avanguardia was then created, together with the\r\nOpera Nazionale Balilla, the organization for boys and girls which,\r\nbecause of its numerous merits and the high value of its educational\r\nactivities, I have chosen even recently to term “The invaluable pupil\r\nof the Fascist Régime.”\r\n\r\nThis programme brought forth unparalleled results; as a result of it\r\nthe Party has never encountered a really serious crisis. I believe that\r\nI can count among my qualities the ability to act in good season and\r\nto strike at the right moment without false sentimentality where the\r\nshadow of a weakness or of a trap is hidden.\r\n\r\nIn this watchful work of prevention, I have always had at my side good\r\nsecretaries of the Party who have helped me immeasurably. Michele\r\nBianchi had already ably led the Party until the March on Rome. He had\r\nbeen able to balance the particularly violent character of the movement\r\nagainst the demands of political situations which had reality and which\r\nmust be handled with wisdom. Michele Bianchi has been an excellent\r\npolitical secretary because of this very reason, and to-day he is still\r\nwith the government, as my greatly appreciated collaborator in internal\r\npolitics. He has a political mind of the first order, a reflective\r\nmind; he is faithful at every hour. The régime can count on him every\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Sansanelli, a courageous participant in the late war,\r\nand to-day president of the International Federation of World War\r\nVeterans, took his place. The Hon. Sansanelli has been able to face\r\nvague secessionist movements, which revealed an origin undoubtedly in\r\nthe peculiar, pre-Fascist, Italian political Masonry.\r\n\r\nThere was in that period a reprisal by anti-Fascist forces. The\r\nold Liberal world, defeated, but tolerated by the generosity of the\r\nrégime, was not exactly aware of the new order of things. It regained\r\nits wonted haughtiness; Italian Masonry was still developing, with its\r\ninfinite and uncontrollable tentacles, its practices of corruption\r\nand of dissolution. These forces of negation even armed the Communist\r\nremnants in the obscurity of ambushes and cellars. A new “direttorio,”\r\npresided over by the Secretary Hon. Giunta until September, 1924,\r\nwas formed after the elections. I have already spoken of the Fascist\r\nactivity of the Hon. Giunta. In the second half of that year, the\r\nanti-Fascist movement, aroused by obscure national and international\r\nforces, showed itself in growing intensity on all fronts. I threw it\r\ndown on its nose with my speech of January 3, 1925. But also, following\r\nthat, I determined that a line of more combatively intransigent nature\r\nshould be imposed by our party: and with this duty in mind, on February\r\n12, 1925, I appointed the Hon. Roberto Farinacci General Secretary of\r\nthe Party.\r\n\r\nFarinacci knew how to show himself worthy of the task with which I had\r\nintrusted him. His accomplishments, considered in their entirety and\r\nin the light of the results attained, were those of a well-deserving\r\nSecretary. He broke up the residues of the “aventinismo” which had\r\nremained here and there in the country; he gave a tone of high and\r\ncutting intransigentism, not only political but also moral, to the\r\nwhole Party, invoked against offenders and plotters those exceptional\r\nlaws which I had promulgated after four attempted assassinations\r\nhad demonstrated the criminality of anti-Fascism. I was closely\r\nfollowing this movement of vigorous reprisal by the Party and had\r\nprepared in time the necessary provisions. The Hon. Farinacci is one of\r\nthe founders of Italian Fascism. He has followed me faithfully since\r\n1914.\r\n\r\nAfter his task had been accomplished, the Hon. Farinacci left the\r\nposition of General Secretary to the Hon. Augusto Turati, a courageous\r\nveteran of the World War, a man of clear mind and aristocratic\r\ntemperament, who has been able to give the Party the style of the new\r\ntimes and the consciousness of the new needs. The Hon. Turati has\r\naccomplished a great and indispensable work of educational improvement\r\nwith the Fascist masses. Besides these precious elements in the high\r\npositions of the Party of to-day, I must mention the Hon. Renato Ricci\r\nfor the organization of the “Balilla,” Melchiorri for the Militia,\r\nMarinelli, a courageous administrative secretary, Starrace, a valorous\r\nveteran, and Arpinati, a faithful Black Shirt since March, 1919, and a\r\nfounder of Fascism in Bologna.\r\n\r\nThe Party has yielded me new prefects for Fascist Italy, elements for\r\nsyndicalist organization, and consuls, while various deputies have been\r\nappointed Ministers and Under-Secretaries. Little by little, proceeding\r\nby degrees, I have given an ever more integral and intransigent line\r\nto the whole world of government. Almost all positions of command have\r\nto-day been intrusted to Fascist elements. Thus after four years of the\r\nrégime we have given actuality to the formula: “All the Power to\r\nall-Fascism” which I enunciated in June, 1925, at a Fascist meeting in\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nI have controlled my impatience. I have avoided leaps into darkness.\r\nI do not sleep my way to conclusions, I have blended the pre-existing\r\nneeds with the formation of a future. Naturally, giving to the state a\r\ncompletely Fascist character and filling all the ganglia of national\r\nlife with the vitality and newer force of faithful Black Shirts, I not\r\nonly did not detract from, but constantly added to the importance of\r\nthe National Fascist Party as the force of the régime. This transfer\r\nfrom political organization to the permanent organization of a state\r\nguarantees in the most solid manner the future of the régime. I have\r\nlaid, with my own hands, the corner-stone of representative reform,\r\nbased on the interests of Italian unity and the Italian cosmos, and\r\nI have arranged that the Grand Fascist Council became a definite\r\nconstitutional organ for the constancy of the state. Thus the Fascist\r\nParty, while remaining independent, is bound by ties of steel to the\r\nvery essence of the new Fascist state.\r\n\r\n                            * * * * *\r\n\r\nA subject that is always interesting and is often misunderstood both\r\nby Italians and foreigners is that of the relations between State\r\nand Church in Italy. The Law of the Guarantees in 1870, by which the\r\nquestion was believed to be solved, remains a form of relationship\r\nwhich since the rise of Fascism has not caused friction of any great\r\nsignificance. To be sure, the Holy See renews, once in a while,\r\nprotestations for the supposed rights usurped in Rome by the\r\nItalian state, but there are no substantial reasons for apprehension,\r\nnor profound differences.\r\n\r\nThis serenity of relations is a tribute to the Fascist régime. In the\r\npast a legend had blossomed around dissensions of historical character\r\ntending to foment partisan hatreds; an anti-clerical activity had been\r\ndeveloped for a long time in various forms, and it served, through\r\nmany sections of the so-called “Free thought” groups, to augment the\r\nnefarious political influence of our form of Masonry. The idea was\r\ndiffused that religion was a “private affair,” and religion was not\r\nadmitted in any sort of public act.\r\n\r\nIf, however, anti-clericalism was superficial and coarse, on the other\r\nhand, the Church, with its lack of comprehension of the new Italy, with\r\nits tenacity in its intransigent position, had only exasperated its\r\nopponents. Anti-Church forces even went so far as to ban every Catholic\r\nsymbol and even Christian doctrine from the schools. These were periods\r\nof Socialist-Masonic audacity. It was necessary that ideas should be\r\nclarified. We had to differentiate and separate the principles of\r\npolitical clericalism from the vital essence of the Catholic faith.\r\nThe situation as it had stood caused, in Italy, dangerous deviations,\r\nwhich ranged from the policy of “abstention” between 1870 and 1900, to\r\nthe Popular party of baleful memory which was destined to degenerate\r\nlittle by little until in 1925 it took a form of clerical bolshevism\r\nwhich I resolutely liquidated and put into political and intellectual\r\nbankruptcy.\r\n\r\nThis troubled atmosphere, so infested by misunderstandings and\r\nsuperficialities, has been relieved by Fascism. I did not deceive\r\nmyself as to the seriousness of the crisis which is always opening\r\nbetween State and Church; I had not fooled myself into thinking that\r\nI would be able to cure a dissension which involves the highest\r\ninterests and principles, but I had made a deep study of those lines\r\nof set directions and inflexible temperaments which, if softened,\r\nwere destined to make the principles of religious faith, religious\r\nobservance, and respect for the forms of worship bloom again,\r\nindependent of political controversies. They are, in fact, the\r\nessential factors of the moral and civic development of a country which\r\nis renewing itself.\r\n\r\nTo be sincere, I must add that high circles of the Vatican have not\r\nalways been known to appreciate my work, possibly for political\r\nreasons, and have not helped me in the steps which appeared wise for\r\nall. My labor had not been easy nor light; our Masonry had spun a most\r\nintricate net of anti-religious activity; it dominated the currents\r\nof thought; it exercised its influence over publishing houses, over\r\nteaching, over the administration of justice and even over certain\r\ndominant sections of the armed forces.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of how far things had gone, this significant example\r\nis sufficient. When, in parliament, I delivered my first speech\r\nof November 16, 1922, after the Fascist revolution, I concluded\r\nby invoking the assistance of God in my difficult task. Well,\r\nthis sentence of mine seemed to be out of place! In the Italian\r\nparliament, a field of action for Italian Masonry, the name of\r\nGod had been banned for a long time. Not even the Popular party—the\r\nso-called Catholic party—had ever thought of speaking of God. In\r\nItaly, a political man did not even turn his thoughts to the Divinity.\r\nAnd, even if he had ever thought of doing so, political opportunism\r\nand cowardice would have deterred him, particularly in a legislative\r\nassembly. It remained for me to make this bold innovation! And in an\r\nintense period of revolution! What is the truth? It is that a faith\r\nopenly professed is a sign of strength.\r\n\r\nI have seen the religious spirit bloom again; churches once more are\r\ncrowded, the ministers of God are themselves invested with new respect.\r\nFascism has done and is doing its duty.\r\n\r\nSome ecclesiastical circles have not shown, as I have said, ability to\r\nevaluate and understand in all its importance the political and moral\r\nrebirth of new Italy.\r\n\r\nOne of the first symptoms of such lack of comprehension was exhibited\r\nat the beginning of Fascist rule: at first the so-called Catholic party\r\nwanted to collaborate by having some members in the government, in the\r\nnew régime. This collaboration, however, began to lead us through a\r\nseries of reticences and misunderstandings, and after six months I was\r\nforced to show the door to the ministers belonging to that party.\r\n\r\nI have seen the Popular party allied with Masonry. But when parties\r\nhave not clashed on the Italian political scene, the troubles between\r\nState and Church have been reflected in international politics.\r\nThe Roman Question has been once more under discussion. Both\r\nhistorical forces have strengthened their concepts. Journalistic\r\ncontroversies and objective discussions have demonstrated that the\r\nproblem is not ripe and may be insoluble. Perhaps two mentalities and\r\ntwo worlds are confronting each other in a century-old historic and\r\nimpracticable opposition. One has its roots in the religion of the\r\nfathers and lives by the ethical forces of the Civis Romanus; the other\r\nhas the universal character of equality of brothers in God.\r\n\r\nTo-day, with the highest loyalty, Fascism understands and values\r\nthe Church and its strength: such is the duty of every Catholic\r\ncitizen. But politics, the defense of national interests, the battles\r\nover ourselves and others, must be the work of the modern Fascist\r\nItalians who want to see the immortal and irreplaceable Church of\r\nSaint Peter respected, and do not wish ever to confound themselves\r\nwith any political force which has no disclosed outline and knows no\r\npatriotism. Whatever the errors of its representatives may be, nobody\r\nthinks of taking away from the Church its universal character, but\r\neverybody is right in complaining about certain disavowals of some\r\nItalian Catholics, and may justly resent political approval of certain\r\nmiddle-European currents, upon which Italy places even now her most\r\nample reservations. Faith in Italy has been strengthened. Fascism gives\r\nimpulse and vigor to the religion of the country. But it will never be\r\nable for any reason to renounce the sovereign rights of the state and\r\nof the functions of the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                               EN ROUTE\r\n\r\n\r\nSome readers of my autobiographic record may attribute to these pages\r\nof mine the character of a completed life story. If they have believed\r\nthat story completed they are mistaken. It is absurd to believe that\r\none can conclude a life of battles at the age of forty-five.\r\n\r\nDetailed memoirs of intimate and personal character are the attributes\r\nof old age and the chimney-corner. I have no intention of writing\r\nany “memoirs.” They only represent the consciousness of a definitely\r\ncompleted cycle. They do not appear of much importance to a man who is\r\nin the most vigorous ardor of his activities!\r\n\r\nI was the leader of the revolution and chief of the government at\r\nthirty-nine. Not only have I not finished my job, but I often feel that\r\nI have not even begun it.\r\n\r\nThe better part comes toward me. I go toward it at this moment. But\r\nI take pride in affirming that I have laid solid foundations for the\r\nbuilding of Fascism. Many ask me what my policy in the future will be,\r\nand where my final objective lies.\r\n\r\nMy answers are here. I ask nothing for myself, nor for mine; no\r\nmaterial goods, no honors, no testimonials, no resolutions of approval\r\nwhich presume to consecrate me to History. My objective is simple:\r\nI want to make Italy great, respected, and feared; I want to\r\nrender my nation worthy of her noble and ancient traditions. I want\r\nto accelerate her evolution toward the highest forms of national\r\nco-operation; I want to make a greater prosperity forever possible for\r\nthe whole people. I want to create a political organization to express,\r\nto guarantee, and to safeguard our development. I am tireless in my\r\nwish to see newly born and newly reborn Italians. With all my strength,\r\nwith all my energies, without pause, without interruption, I want to\r\nbring to them their fullest opportunities. I do not lose sight of the\r\nexperience of other peoples, but I build with elements of our own and\r\nin harmony with our own possibilities, with our traditions, and with\r\nthe energy of the Italian people. I have made a profound study of the\r\ninterests, the aspirations and the tendencies of our masses. I push\r\non toward better forces of life and progress. I weigh them, I launch\r\nthem, I guide them. I desire our nation to conquer again, with Fascist\r\nvigor, some decades or perhaps a century of lost history. Our garrison\r\nis the party, which has demonstrated its irreplaceable strength. I have\r\ntrust in young people. Their spiritual and material life is guided by\r\nattentive, quick minds and by ardent hearts. I do not reject advice\r\neven from opponents whenever they are honest. I cover with my contempt\r\ndishonest and lying opponents, slanderers, deniers of the country\r\nand every one who drowns every sense of dignity, every sentiment of\r\nnational and human solidarity in the filthy cesspool of low grudges.\r\nDefeated ones who cluck to the wind, survivors of a building which\r\nhas toppled forever, accomplices in the ruin and shame into which\r\nthe country was to have been dragged, sometimes do not even have the\r\ndignity of silence.\r\n\r\nI am strict with my most faithful followers. I always intervene where\r\nexcesses and intemperance are revealed. I am near to the heart of the\r\nmasses and listen to its beats. I read its aspiration and interests. I\r\nknow the virtue of the race. I probe it in its purity and soundness. I\r\nwill fight vice and degeneracy and will put them down. The so-called\r\n“Liberal institutions” created at other times because of a fallacious\r\nappearance of protection are destroyed and divested of their phrases\r\nand false idealisms by the new force of Fascism with its idealism\r\nplanted on realities.\r\n\r\nAir and light, strength and energy, shine and vibrate in the infinite\r\nsky of Italy! The loftiest civic and national vision to-day leads\r\nthis people to its goal, this people which is living in its great new\r\nspringtime. It animates my long labors. I am forty-five and I feel\r\nthe vigor of my work and my thought. I have annihilated in myself\r\nall self-interest: I, like the most devoted of citizens, place upon\r\nmyself and on every beat of my heart, service to the Italian people.\r\nI proclaim myself their servant. I feel that all Italians understand\r\nand love me; I know that only he is loved who leads without weakness,\r\nwithout deviation, and with disinterestedness and full faith.\r\n\r\nTherefore, going over what I have already done I know that Fascism,\r\nbeing a creation of the Italian race, has met and will meet\r\nhistorical necessities, and so, unconquerable, is destined to make an\r\nindelible impression on the twentieth century of history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAbruzzi, 174.\r\n\r\nAcerbo, Giacomo, 194.\r\n\r\nAdrianople, siege of, 29.\r\n\r\nAdriatic, the, 7, 72;
