No security against future harassment by Congress\r\nwill probably be given. The rain-bow which some have seen, I fear was\r\nset before the termination of the storm. If this be so, those who have\r\nbeen first to hope, to relax their energies, to trust in compromise\r\npromises, will often be the first to sound the alarm when danger again\r\napproaches. Therefore I say, if a reckless and self-sustaining majority\r\nshall trample upon her rights, if the Constitutional equality of the\r\nStates is to be overthrown by force, private and political rights to be\r\nborne down by force of numbers, then, sir, when that victory over\r\nConstitutional rights is achieved, the shout of triumph which announces\r\nit, before it is half uttered, will be checked by the united, the\r\ndetermined action of the South, and every breeze will bring to the\r\nmarauding destroyers of those rights, the warning: woe, woe to the\r\nriders who trample them down! I submit the report and resolutions, and\r\nask that they may be read and printed for the use of the\r\nSenate.—(_Cong. Globe_, p. 943-4.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Senate of the United States, June 27, 1850, on the Compromise\r\nBill:\r\n\r\nIf I have a superstition, sir, which governs my mind and holds it\r\ncaptive, it is a superstitious reverence for the Union. If one can\r\ninherit a sentiment, I may be said to have inherited this from my\r\nrevolutionary father. And if education can develop a sentiment in the\r\nheart and mind of man, surely mine has been such as would most develop\r\nfeelings of attachment for the Union. But, sir, I have an allegiance to\r\nthe State which I represent here. I have an allegiance to those who\r\nhave entrusted their interests to me, which every consideration of\r\nfaith and of duty, which every feeling of honor, tells me is above all\r\nother political considerations. I trust I shall never find my\r\nallegiance there and here in conflict. God forbid that the day should\r\never come when to be true to my constituents is to be hostile to the\r\nUnion. If, sir, we have reached that hour in the progress of our\r\ninstitutions, it is past the age to which the Union should have lived.\r\nIf we have got to the point when it is treason to the United States to\r\nprotect the rights and interests of our constituents, I ask why should\r\nthey longer be represented here? why longer remain a part of the Union?\r\nIf there is a dominant party in this Union which can deny to us\r\nequality, and the rights we derive through the Constitution; if we are\r\nno longer the freemen our fathers left us; if we are to be crushed by\r\nthe power of an unrestrained majority, this is not the Union for which\r\nthe blood of the Revolution was shed; this is not the Union I was\r\ntaught from my cradle to revere; this is not the Union in the service\r\nof which a large portion of my life has been passed; this is not the\r\nUnion for which our fathers pledged their property, their lives, and\r\nsacred honor. No, sir, this would be a central Government, raised on\r\nthe destruction of all the principles of the Constitution, and the\r\nfirst, the highest obligation of every man who has sworn to support\r\nthat Constitution would be resistance to such usurpation. This is my\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nMy colleague has truly represented the people of Mississippi as\r\nardently attached to the Union. I think he has not gone beyond the\r\ntruth when he has placed Mississippi one of the first, if not the\r\nfirst, of the States of the Confederation in attachment to it. But,\r\nsir, even that deep attachment and habitual reverence for the Union,\r\ncommon to us all—even that, it may become necessary to try by the\r\ntouchstone of reason. It is not impossible that they should unfurl the\r\nflag of disunion. It is not impossible that violations of the\r\nConstitution and of their rights, should drive them to that dread\r\nextremity. I feel well assured that they will never reach it until it\r\nhas been twice and three times justified. If, when thus fully\r\nwarranted, they want a standard bearer, in default of a better, I am at\r\ntheir command.—(_Cong. Globe_, p. 995-6)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Fourth of July, 1858, At Sea.\r\n\r\n[From the Boston Post.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fine ship _Joseph Whitney_, from Baltimore, Captain S. Howes, was\r\nmaking for this port on the day of the celebration of the nation’s\r\nbirth, and among an unusually brilliant array of passengers from\r\ndifferent parts of the country, was the distinguished Senator,\r\nJefferson Davis, of Mississippi. The patriotic suggestion of the\r\ncaptain, to celebrate the day in a manner befitting the great\r\nanniversary, met with a hearty response from the company, among whom\r\nwere zealous republicans, democrats and Americans. A committee was\r\nappointed to invite the Senator to make an address, and he consented.\r\n\r\nFirst, the Declaration of Independence was read by Sebastian F.\r\nStreeter, Esq., of Baltimore, when Senator Davis made an address of\r\nsingular felicity of diction and impassioned eloquence, and of such a\r\ncharacter as to command the admiration of those who listened to it. He\r\ncommenced by happy allusions to the array of beauty and intelligence\r\nthat stood before him from all parts of our common country; he then\r\npassed in review the condition of the feeble and separate colonies of\r\n1776, and contrasted with it the country now—the only proper republic\r\non earth, as it stood before the world in its wonderful progress in\r\nart, and agriculture, and commerce, and all the elements that\r\nconstitute a great nation. When thus sailing on the Atlantic, looking\r\nto the coast of the United States, he was reminded of those bold\r\nrefugees from the British and French oppression who crosses these water\r\nto found a home in what was then a wilderness. The memory, too, arose\r\nof the many sorrowing hearts and oppressed spirits since born over\r\nthese waves to that refuge from political oppression which our fathers\r\nfounded as the home of liberty and the asylum of mankind. Her terrtiory\r\n{sic}, which now stretches from ocean to ocean, contains a vast\r\ninterior yet unpeopled; and, with a destiny of still further and\r\ncontinued expansion of area, why should the gate of the temple be now\r\nshut upon sorrowing mankind? Rather let it be that the gate should be\r\nforever open, and an emblematic flag, hereafter as heretofore, wave a\r\nwelcome to all to come to the modern Abdella—fugitives from political\r\noppression.\r\n\r\nSenator Davis dwelt at some length on the right of search question—on\r\nthe insulting claim which Great Britain made to a peace-right to visit\r\nour ships. Under the pretence of stopping the slave trade—a trade\r\nagainst which the United States was the first nation to raise its\r\nvoice—she had interrupted and destroyed a lucrative commerce we had\r\nenjoyed in ivory and other products on the coast of Africa. The late\r\noutrages in the Gulf found us, as a people, with domestic quarrels on\r\nour hands; but if this power counted on existing divisions and on\r\nmaking them wider, the result showed how great was her error. The\r\ninsult was resented by a united people; the Senate, as one man, leaped\r\nup against British pretensions; while England, as suddenly, astonished,\r\nwithdrew her pretensions. The claim she so long preferred is given\r\nup—entirely abandoned. The same spirit that resented insult in the past\r\nwill resent it in the future. I stand, said the Senator, substantially\r\non the deck of an American vessel; it is American soil; the American\r\nflag floats over it; its right to course the ocean pathway is perfect.\r\nWhen the blue firmament reflected its own color in the sea, it was the\r\nunappropriated property of mankind; and it was arrogant and idle for\r\nany nation to deny to the United States her full enjoyment of this\r\ncommon property. It was for the full and undisturbed enjoyment of this\r\nright that out fathers, when much less prepared for war than we are\r\nnow, engaged in the conflict of 1812; and for this right we were ready\r\nto strike in 1858. Let a feign power, under any pretence whatever,\r\ninsult the American flag, and it will find that we are not a divided\r\npeople, but that a mighty arm will be raised to smite down the\r\ninsulter, and this great country will continue united.\r\n\r\nTrifling politicians in the South, or in the North, or in the West, may\r\ncontinue to talk otherwise, but it will be of no avail. They are like\r\nthe mosquitoes around the ox: they annoy, but they cannot wound, and\r\nnever kill. There was a common interest which run through all the\r\ndiversified occupations and various products of these sovereign States;\r\nthere was a common sentiment of nationality which beat in every\r\nAmerican bosom; there were common memories sweet to us all, and, though\r\nclouds had occasionally darkened our political sky, the good sense and\r\nthe good feeling of the people had thus far averted any catastrophe\r\ndestructive of our constitution and the Union. It was in fraternity and\r\nan elevation of principle which rose superior to sectional or\r\nindividual aggrandizement that the foundations of our Union were laid;\r\nand if we, the present generation, be worthy of our ancestry, we shall\r\nnot only protect those foundations from destruction, but build higher\r\nand wider this temple of liberty, and inscribe perpetuity upon its\r\ntablet.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his beautiful speech, senator Davis passed a noble\r\neulogium on our mother country; and dwelt on the many reasons why the\r\nmost cordial friendship should be maintained with her; and he concluded\r\nby a tribute to the fair sex—the women—beautiful woman; to the wondrous\r\neducational influence as the mother which she exercised over the minds\r\nof men. It is ever, at all times, felt and operative—upon the dreary\r\nwaste of ocean, on the lonely prairie, in the troublous contests at the\r\nnational halls. And when the arm is moved in the deadly conflicts of\r\nthe battle-field, and the foe is vanquished, then the gentle influences\r\ninstilled by women do their work, and the heart melts into tears of\r\npity and prompts to deeds of mercy.\r\n\r\nAfter this intellectual repast, then succeeded congratulations; the air\r\nwas made vocal with song; while, through the foresight of the gallant\r\ncaptain, at the evening hour, the sky about the good ship Joseph\r\nWhitney was brilliant with those various pyrotechnic displays which\r\nmust be so grateful to the spirit of patriotic John Adams, of bonfire\r\nand illumination-memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeech at the Portland Serenade,\r\n\r\nJuly 9th, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the music had ceased, Mr. Davis appeared upon the steps, and as\r\nsoon as the prolonged applause with which he was greeted had subsided,\r\nhe spoke in substance as follows:\r\n\r\nFellow Countrymen:—Accept my sincere thanks for this manifestation of\r\nyour kindness. Vanity does not lead me so far to misconceive your\r\npurpose as to appropriate the demonstration to myself; but it is not\r\nless gratifying to me to be made the medium through which Maine tenders\r\nan expression of regard to her sister Mississippi. It is moreover, with\r\nfeelings of profound gratification that I witness this indication of\r\nthat national sentiment and fraternity which made us, and which alone\r\ncan keep us, one people. At a period, but as yesterday when compared\r\nwith the life of nations, these States were separate, and in sorts\r\nrespects opposing colonies; their only relation to each other was that\r\nof a common allegiance to the government of Great Britain. So separate,\r\nindeed almost hostile, was their attitude, that when Gen. Stark, of\r\nBennington memory, was captured by savages on the head waters of the\r\nKennebec, he was subsequently taken by them to Albnny {sic} where they\r\nwent to sell furs, and again led away a captive, without interference\r\non the part of the inhabitants of that neighboring colony to demand or\r\nobtain his release. United as we now are, were a citizen of the United\r\nStates, as an act of hostility to our country, imprisoned or slain in\r\nany quarter of the world, whether on land or sea, the people of each\r\nand every State of the Union, with one heart, and with one voice, would\r\ndemand redress, and woe be to him against whom a brother’s blood cried\r\nto us from the ground. Such is the fruit of the wisdom and the justice\r\nwith which our fathers bound contending colonies into confederation and\r\nblended different habits and rival interests into a harmonious whole,\r\nso that shoulder to shoulder they entered on the trial of the\r\nrevolution, step with step trod its thorny paths until they reached the\r\nheight of national independence and founded the constitutional\r\nrepresentative liberty, which is our birthright.\r\n\r\nWhen the mother country entered upon her career of oppression, in\r\ndisregard of chartered and constitutional rights, our forefathers did\r\nnot stop to measure the exact weight of the burden, or to ask whether\r\nthe pressure bore most upon this colony or upon that, but saw in it the\r\ninfraction of a great principle, the denial of a common right, in\r\ndefence of which they made common cause; Massachusetts, Virginia and\r\nSouth Carolina vieing with each other as to who should be foremost in\r\nthe struggle, where the penalty of failure would be a dishonorable\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nTempered by the trials and sacrifices of the revolution, dignified by\r\nits noble purposes, elevated by its brilliant triumphs, endeared to\r\neach other by its glorious memories, they abandoned the confederacy,\r\nnot to fly apart when the outward pressure of hostile fleets and armies\r\nwere removed, but to draw closer their embrace in the formation of a\r\nmore perfect union. By such men, thus trained and ennobled, our\r\nConstitution was formed. It stands a monument of principle, of\r\nforecast, and, above all, of that liberality which made each willing to\r\nsacrifice local interest, individual prejudice or temporary good to the\r\ngeneral welfare, and the perpetuity of the Republican institutions\r\nwhich they had passed through fire and blood to secure. The grants were\r\nas broad as were necessary for the functions of the general agent, and\r\nthe mutual concessions were twice blessed, blessing both him who gave\r\nand him who received. Whatever was necessary for domestic government,\r\nrequisite in the social organization of each community, was retained by\r\nthe States and the people thereof; and these it was made the duty of\r\nall to defend and maintain.\r\n\r\nSuch, in very general terms, is the rich political legacy our fathers\r\nbequeathed to us. Shall we preserve and transmit it to posterity? Yes,\r\nyes, the heart responds, and the judgment answers, the task is easily\r\nperformed. It but requires that each should attend to that which most\r\nconcerns him, and on which alone he has rightful power to decide and to\r\nact. That each should adhere to the terms of a written compact and that\r\nall should cooperate for that which interest, duty and honor demand.\r\nFor the general affairs of our country, both foreign and domestic, we\r\nhave a national executive and a national legislature. Representatives\r\nand Senators are chosen by districts and by States, but their acts\r\naffect the whole country, and their obligations are to the whole\r\npeople. He who holding either seat would confine his investigations to\r\nthe mere interests of his immediate constituents would be derelict to\r\nhis plain duty; and he who would legislate in hostility to any section\r\nwould be morally unfit for the station, and surely an unsafe depositary\r\nif not a treacherous guardian of the inheritance with which we are\r\nblessed.\r\n\r\nNo one, more than myself; recognizes the binding force of the\r\nallegiance which the citizen owes to the State of his citizenship, but\r\nthat State being a party to our compact, a member of our union, fealty\r\nto the federal Constitution is not in opposition to, but flows from the\r\nallegiance due to one of the United States. Washington was not less a\r\nVirginian when he commanded at Boston; nor did Gates or Greene weaken\r\nthe bonds which bound them to their several States, by their campaigns\r\nin the South. In proportion as a citizen loves his own State, will he\r\nstrive to honor by preserving her name and her fame free from the\r\ntarnish of having failed to observe her obligations, and to fulfil her\r\nduties to her sister States. Each page of our history is illustrated by\r\nthe names and the deeds of those who have well understood, and\r\ndischarged the obligation. Have we so degenerated, that we can no\r\nlonger emulate their virtues? Have the purposes for which our Union was\r\nformed, lost their value? Has patriotism ceased to be a virtue, and is\r\nnarrow sectionalism no longer to be counted a crime? Shall the North\r\nnot rejoice that the progress of agriculture in the South has given to\r\nher great staple the controlling influence of the commerce of the\r\nworld, and put manufacturing nations under bond to keep the peace with\r\nthe United States? Shall the South not exult in the fact, that the\r\nindustry and persevering intelligence of the North, has placed her\r\nmechanical skill in the front ranks of the civilized world—that our\r\nmother country, whose haughty minister some eighty odd years ago\r\ndeclared that not a hob-nail should be made in the colonies, which are\r\nnow the United States, was brought some four years ago to recognize our\r\npre-eminence by sending a commission to examine our work shops, and our\r\nmachinery, to perfect their own manufacture of the arms requisite for\r\ntheir defence? Do not our whole people, interior and seaboard, North,\r\nSouth, East, and West, alike feel proud of the hardihood, the\r\nenterprise, the skill, and the courage of the Yankee sailor, who has\r\nborne our flag far as the ocean bears its foam, and caused the name and\r\nthe character of the United States to be known and respected wherever\r\nthere is wealth enough to woo commerce, and intelligence enough to\r\nhonor merit? So long as we preserve, and appreciate the achievements of\r\nJefferson and Adams, of Franklin and Madison, of Hamilton, of Hancock,\r\nand of Rutledge, men who labored for the whole country, and lived for\r\nmankind, we cannot sink to the petty strife which would sap the\r\nfoundations, and destroy the political fabric our fathers erected, and\r\nbequeathed as an inheritance to our posterity forever.\r\n\r\nSince the formation of the Constitution, a vast extension of territory,\r\nand the varied relations arising there from, have presented problems\r\nwhich could not have been foreseen. It is just cause for\r\nadmiration—even wonder, that the provisions of the fundamental law\r\nshould have been found so fully adequate to all the wants of\r\ngovernment, new in its organization, and new in many of the principles\r\non which it was founded. Whatever fears may have once existed as to the\r\nconsequences of territorial expansion, must give way before the\r\nevidence which the past affords. The general government, strictly\r\nconfined to its delegated functions, and the States left in the\r\nundisturbed exercise of all else, we have a theory and practice which\r\nfits our government for immeasurable domain, and might, under a\r\nmillennium of nations, embrace mankind.\r\n\r\nFrom the slope of the Atlantic our population with ceaseless tide has\r\npoured into the wide and fertile valley of the Mississippi, with\r\neddying whirl has passed to the coast of the Pacific, from the West and\r\nthe East the tides are rushing towards each other—and the mind is\r\ncarried to the day when all the cultivable and will be inhabited, and\r\nthe American people will sign for more wildernesses to conquer. But\r\nthere is here a physico-political problem presented for our solution.\r\nWere it was purely physical—your past triumphs would leave but little\r\ndoubt of your capacity to solve it.\r\n\r\nA community, which, when less than twenty thousand, conceived the grand\r\nproject of crossing the White Mountains, and, unaided, save by the\r\nstimulus which jeers and prophecies of failure gave, successfully\r\nexecuted the herculean work, might well be impatient, if it were\r\nsuggested that a physical problem was before us, too difficult for\r\ntheir mastery. The history of man teaches that high mountains and wide\r\ndeserts have resisted the permanent extension of empire, and have\r\nformed the immutable boundaries of States. From time to time, under\r\nsome able leader, have the hordes of the upper plains of Asia swept\r\nover the adjacent country, and rolled their conquering columns over\r\nSouthern Europe. Yet, after the lapse of a few generations, the\r\nphysical law to which I have referred, has asserted its supremacy, and\r\nthe boundaries of those States differ little now from those which\r\nobtained three thousand years ago. Rome flew her conquering eagles over\r\nthe then known world, and has now subsided into the little territory on\r\nwhich her great city was originally built. The Alps and the Pyrenees\r\nhave been unable to restrain imperial France; but her expansion was a\r\nleverish action; her advance and her retreat were tracked with blood,\r\nand those mountain ridges are the re-established limits of her empire.\r\nShall the Rocky Mountains prove a dividing barrier to us? Were ours a\r\ncentral consolidated government, instead of a Union of sovereign\r\nStates, our fate might be learned from the history of other nations.\r\nThanks to the wisdom and independent spirit of our forefathers, this is\r\nnot our case. Each State having sole charge of its local interests and\r\ndomestic affairs, the problem which to others has been insoluble, to us\r\nis made easy. Rapid, safe, and easy communication and co-operation\r\namong all parts of our continent-wide republic. The network of\r\nrailroads which bind the North and the South, the slope of the Atlantic\r\nand the valley of the Mississippi, together testify that our people\r\nhave the power to perform, in that regard, whatever it is their will to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nWe require a railroad to the States of the Pacific for present uses;\r\nthe time no doubt will come when we shall have need of two or three; it\r\nmay be more. Because of the desert character of the interior country\r\nthe work will be difficult and expensive. It will require the efforts\r\nof an united people. The bickerings of little politicians, the\r\njealousies of sections, must give way to dignity of purpose and zeal\r\nfor the common good. If the object be obstructed by contention and\r\ndivision as to whether the route to be selected shall be northern,\r\nsouthern or central, the handwriting is on the wall, and it requires\r\nlittle skill to see that failure is the interpretation of the\r\ninscription. You are a practical people and may ask, how is that\r\ncontest to be avoided? By taking the question out of the hands of\r\npoliticians altogether. Let the Government give such aid as it is\r\nproper for it to render to the Company which shall propose the most\r\nfeasible and advantageous plan; then leave to capitalists with judgment\r\nsharpened by interest, the selection of the route, and the difficulties\r\nwill diminish as did those which you overcame when you connected your\r\nharbor with the Canadian Provinces.\r\n\r\nIt would be to trespass on your kindness and to violate the proprieties\r\nof the occasion, were I to detain the vast concourse which stands\r\nbefore me, by entering on the discussion of controverted topics, or by\r\nfurther indulging in the expression of such reflections as\r\ncircumstances suggest.\r\n\r\nI came to your city in quest of health and repose. From the moment I\r\nentered it you have showered upon me kindness and hospitality. Though\r\nmy experience has taught me to anticipate good rather than evil from my\r\nfellow man, it had not prepared me to expect such unremitting attention\r\nas has here been bestowed. I have been jocularly asked in relation to\r\nmy coming here, whether I had secured a guaranty {sic} for my safety,\r\nand lo, I have found it. I stand in the midst of thousands of my fellow\r\ncitizens. But my friend, I came neither distrusting, not apprehensive,\r\nof which you have proof in the fact that I brought with me the objects\r\nof tenderest affection and solicitude—my wife and my children; they\r\nhave shared with me your hospitality, and will alike remain your\r\ndebtors. If at some future time, when I am mingled with the dust, and\r\nthe arm of my infant son has been nerved for deeds of manhood, the\r\nstorm of war should burst upon your city, I feel that, relying upon his\r\ninheriting the instincts of his ancestors and mine, I may pledge him in\r\nthat perilous hour to stand by your side in the defence of your hearth\r\nstones, and in maintaining the honor of a flag whose constellation\r\nthough torn and smoked in many a battle, by sea and land, has never\r\nbeen stained with dishonor, and will I trust forever fly as free as the\r\nbreeze which unfolds it.\r\n\r\nA stranger to you, the salubrity of your location and the beauty of its\r\nscenery were not wholly unknown to me, nor were there wanting\r\nassociations which bust memory connected with your people. You will\r\npardon me for alluding to one whose genius shed a lustre upon all it\r\ntouched, and whose qualities gathered about him hosts of friends,\r\nwherever he was known. Prentiss, a native of Portland, lived from youth\r\nto middle age in the county of my residence, and the inquiries which\r\nhave been made, show me that the youth excited the interest which the\r\ngreatness of the man justified, and that his memory thus remains a link\r\nto connect your home with mine.\r\n\r\nA cursory view, when passing through your town on former occasions, had\r\nimpressed me with the great advantages of your harbor, its easy\r\nentrance, its depth, and its extensive accommodation for shipping. But\r\nits advantages, and if facilities as they have been developed by closer\r\ninspection, have grown upon me until I realize that it is no boast, but\r\nthe language of sober truth which in the present state of commerce\r\npronounces them unequaled in any harbor of our country.\r\n\r\nAnd surely no place could be more inviting to an invalid who sought a\r\nrefuge from the heat of a southern summer. Here waving elms offer him\r\nshared walks, and magnificent residences surrounded by flowers, fill\r\nthe mind with ideas of comfort and of rest. If weary of constant\r\ncontact with his fellow men, he seeks a deeper seclusion, there, in the\r\nback ground of this grand amphitheatre, lie the eternal mountains,\r\nfrowning with brow of rock and cap of snow upon the smiling fields\r\nbeneath, and there in its recesses may be found as much of wildness,\r\nand as much of solitude, as the pilgrim weary of the cares of life can\r\ndesire. If he turn to the front, your capacious harbor, studded with\r\ngreen islands of ever varying light and shade, and enlivened by all the\r\nstirring evidences of commercial activity, offer him the mingled charms\r\nof busy life and nature’s calm repose. A few miles further, and he may\r\nsite upon the quiet shore to listen to the murmuring wave until the\r\ntroubled spirit sinks to rest, and in the little sail that vanishes on\r\nthe illimitable sea, we may find the type of the voyage which he is so\r\nsoon to take, when, his ephemeral existence closed, he embarks for that\r\nbetter state which lies beyond the grave.\r\n\r\nRichly endowed as you are by nature in all which contributes to\r\npleasure and to usefulness, the stranger cannot pass without paying a\r\ntribute to the much which your energy has achieved for yourselves.\r\nWhere else will one find a more happy union of magnificence and\r\ncomfort, where better arrangements to facilitate commerce? Where so\r\nmuch of industry, with so little noise and bustle? Where, in a phrase,\r\nso much effected in proportion to the means employed? We hear the puff\r\nof the engine, the roll of the wheel, the ring of the axe, and the saw,\r\nbut the stormy, passionate exclamations so often mingled with the\r\nsounds, are no where heard. Yet, neither these nor other things which I\r\nhave mentioned; attractive though they be, have been to me the chief\r\ncharm which I have found among you. For above all these I place the\r\ngentle kindness, the cordial welcome, the hearty grasp, which made me\r\nfeel truly and at once, though wandering far, that I was still at home.\r\n\r\nMy friends, I thank you for this additional manifestation of your good\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeech at the Portland Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, August 24th, 1858, when the Democratic Convention had\r\nnearly concluded its business, a committee was appointed to wait on Mr.\r\nDavis, and request him to gratify them by his presence in the\r\nConvention. He expressed his willingness to comply with the wishes of\r\nhis countrymen, and accordingly repaired to the City Hall. On entering\r\nhe was greeted in the most cordial and enthusiastic manner. After\r\nbusiness was finished, he proceeded to the rostrum, and, addressing the\r\nConvention, said:\r\n\r\nFriends, fellow-citizens, and brethren in Democracy, he thanked them\r\nfor the honor conferred by their invitation to be present at their\r\ndeliberations, and expressed the pleasure he felt in standing in the\r\nmidst of the Democracy of Maine—amidst so many manifestations of the\r\nimportant and gratifying fact that the Democratic is, in truth, a\r\nnational party. He did not fail to remember that the principles of the\r\nparty declaring for the largest amount of personal liberty consistent\r\nwith good government, and to the greatest possible extent of community\r\nand municipal independence, would render it in their view, as in his\r\nown, improper for him to speak of those subjects which were local in\r\ntheir character, and he would endeavor not so far to trespass upon\r\ntheir kindness as to refer to anything which bore such connection,\r\ndirect or indirect—and he hoped that those of their opponents who,\r\nhaving the control of type, fancied themselves licensed to manufacture\r\nfacts, would not hold them responsible for what he did not say. He said\r\nhe should carry with him, as one of the pleasant memories of his brief\r\nsojourn in Maine, the additional assurance, which intercourse with the\r\npeople had given him, that there still lives a National Party,\r\nstruggling and resolved bravely to struggle for the maintenance of the\r\nConstitution, the abatement of sectional hostility, and the\r\npreservation of the fraternal compact made by the Fathers of the\r\nRepublic. He said, rocked in the cradle of Democracy, having learned\r\nits precepts from his father,—who was a Revolutionary Soldier—and in\r\nlater years having been led forward in the same doctrine by the patriot\r\nstatesman—of whom such honorable mention was made in their\r\nresolutions—Andrew Jackson, he had always felt that he had in his own\r\nheart a standard by which to measure the sentiments of a Democrat.\r\nWhen, therefore, he had seen evidences of a narrow sectionalism, which\r\nsought not the good of the whole, not even the benefit of a part, but\r\naimed at the injury of a particular section, the pulsations of his own\r\nheart told him such cannot be the purpose, the aim, or the wish of any\r\nAmerican Democrat—and he saw around him to-day evidence that his\r\nopinion in this respect had here its verification. As he looked upon\r\nthe weather-beaten faces of the veterans and upon the flushed cheek and\r\nflashing eye of the youth, which told of the fixed resolve of the one,\r\nand the ardent, noble hopes of the other, strengthened hope and bright\r\nanticipations filled his mind, and he feared not to ask the questions\r\nshall narrow interests, shall local jealousies, shall disregard of the\r\nhigh purposes for which our Union was ordained, continue to distract\r\nour people and impede the progress of our government toward the high\r\nconsummation which prophetic statesmen have so often indicated as her\r\ndestiny?—[Voices, no, no, no! Much applause.]\r\n\r\nThanks for that answer; let every American heart respond no; let every\r\nAmerican head, let every American hand unite in the great object of\r\nNational development. Let our progress be across the land and over the\r\nsea, let our flag as stated in your resolutions, continue to wave its\r\nwelcome to the oppressed, who flee from the despotism of other lands,\r\nuntil the constellation which marks the number of our States which have\r\nalready increased from thirteen to thirty two, shall go on multiplying\r\ninto a bright galaxy covering the field on which we now display the\r\nrevered stripes, which record the original size of our political\r\nfamily, and shall shed its benign light over all mankind, to point them\r\nto the paths of self-government and constitutional liberty.\r\n\r\nHe here referred to the history of the Democratic party, and numbered\r\namong its glories the various acts of territorial acquisition and\r\ntriumphs through its foreign intercourse in the march of civilization\r\nand National amity, as well as in the glories which from time to time\r\nhad been shed by the success of our arms upon the name and character of\r\nthe American people. He alluded to the recent attempt by some of the\r\ngovernments of Europe, to engraft upon National law a prohibition\r\nagainst privateering. He said whenever other governments were willing\r\nto declare that private property should be exempt from the rigors of\r\nwar, on sea as it is on land, our government might meet them more than\r\nhalf way, but to a proposition which would leave private property the\r\nprey of national vessels and thus give the whole privateering to those\r\ngovernments which maintained a large naval establishment in time of\r\npeace, he would unhesitatingly answer no. Our merchant marine\r\nconstituted the militia of the sea—how effective it had been in our\r\nlast struggle with a maritime power, he need not say to the sons of\r\nthose who had figured so conspicuously in that species of warfare. The\r\npolicy of our government was peace. We could not consent to bear the\r\nuseless expense of a naval establishment larger than was necessary for\r\nits proper uses in a time of peace. Relying as we had and must\r\nhereafter upon the merchant marine to man whatever additional vessels\r\nwe should require, and upon the bold and hardy Yankee sailor, when he\r\ncould no longer get freight for his craft, to receive a proper\r\narmament, and go forth like a knight errant of the sea in quest of\r\nadventure against the enemies of his country’s flag.\r\n\r\nHe said our country was powerful for all military purposes, and if\r\nasked to compare her armies and her navy with those of the great powers\r\nof Europe, he would answer, that is not our standard. History teaches\r\nthat our strength is in the courage and patriotism, the skill and\r\nintelligence of our people. A part of the American army was before him,\r\nand a part of the American navy was lying in the harbor of their city.\r\nThat army and that navy had fought the battles of the Revolution, of\r\nthe “war of 1812” and of the war with Mexico, and would never be found\r\nwanting, whilst the patriotism of the earlier days of the Republic,\r\nproved a sufficient cement to hold the different parts of our wide\r\nspread and extending country together. He said that everything around\r\nhim spoke eloquently of the wisdom of the men who founded these\r\ncolonies-their descendants, who sat before him, contrasted strongly, as\r\ndid their history and present power, stand out in bold relief, when\r\ncompared with those of the inhabitants of Central and Southern America.\r\nChief among the reasons for this, he believed to be the self-reliant\r\nhardihood of their forefathers who, when but a handful, found\r\nthemselves confronted by hordes of savages, yet proudly maintained the\r\nintegrity of their race and asserted its supremacy over the descendants\r\nof Shem, in whose tents they had come to dwell. They preferred to\r\nencounter toil, privation and carnage, rather than debase their lineage\r\nand race. Their descendants of that pure and heroic blood have advanced\r\nto the high standard of civilization attainable by that type of\r\nmankind. Stability and progress, wealth and comfort, art and science,\r\nhave followed their footsteps.\r\n\r\nAmong our neighbors of Central and Southern America, we see the\r\nCaucasian mingled with the Indian and the African. They have the forms\r\nof free government, because they have copied them. To its benefits they\r\nhave not attained, because that standard of civilization is above their\r\nrace. Revolution succeeds Revolution, and the country mourns that some\r\npetty chief may triumph, and through a sixty days’ government ape the\r\nrulers of the earth. Even now the nearest and strongest of these\r\nAmerican Republics, which were fashioned after the model of our own,\r\nseems to be tottering to a fall, and the world is inquiring as to who\r\nwill take possession; or, as protector, raise and lead a people who\r\nhave shown themselves incompetent to govern themselves.\r\n\r\nHe said our fathers laid the foundation of Empire, and declared its\r\npurposes; to their sons it remained to complete their superstructure.\r\nThe means by which this end was to be secured were simple and easy. It\r\ninvolved no harder task than that each man should attend to his own\r\nbusiness, that no community should arrogantly assume to interfere with\r\nthe affairs of another—and that all by the honorable obligation of\r\nfulfiling that compact which their fathers had made.\r\n\r\nHe then referred to the commercial position of Maine, and spoke of her\r\nbrightly unfolding prospects of prosperity and greatness. Many\r\nconsidered her wealth to consist of her forests, and that her\r\nprosperity would decline when her timber was exhausted—he held to a\r\ndifferent opinion, and thought they might welcome the day, when the\r\nsombre shadows of the Pine gave place to verdant pastures and fruitful\r\nfields. Was he asked, what then was to become of the interest of\r\nship-building? He would answer—let it be changed from wood to iron. The\r\nskill to be aquired be a few years’ experience, would at a fair price\r\nfor iron, enable our ship builders to construct iron ships, which,\r\ntaking into account their greater capacity for freight and greater\r\ndurability, would be cheaper than vessels of wood, even whilst timber\r\nwas as abundant as now;—at least such was the information he had\r\nderived from persons well informed upon those subjects.\r\n\r\nHe expressed the gratification he felt for the courtesy of the\r\nDemocracy in Maine, and doubted not that the Democracy of Mississippi\r\nwould receive it, with grateful recognition, as evincing fraternal\r\nsentiment by kindness done to one of her sons, not the less a\r\nrepresentative, because a humble member of her Democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeech at Belfast Encampment.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the o’clock the troops at the encampment being under arms, Col.\r\nDavis was escorted to the ground and reviewed them. He was then\r\nintroduced to the troops by Gen. Cushman, as follows—\r\n\r\nOfficers and fellow soldiers, I introduce to you Col. Jefferson Davis,\r\nan eminent citizen of Mississippi,—a man, and I say a hero, who has, in\r\nthe service of his country, been among and faced hostile guns.\r\n\r\nCol. Davis replied as follows—\r\n\r\nCitizen Soldiers:—I feel pleased and gratified at the exhibition I have\r\nwitnessed of the military spirit and instruction of the volunteer\r\nmilitia of Maine. I acknowledge the compliment which has been paid to\r\nme, and I welcome it as the indication of the liberality and national\r\nsentiment which makes the militia of each State the effective, as they\r\nare the constitutional defenders of our whole country.\r\n\r\nTo one who loves his country in all its parts, it is natural to rejoice\r\nin whatever contributes to the prosperity and honor, and marks the\r\nstability and progress of any portion of its people. I therefore look\r\nupon the evidence presented to me of the soldierly enthusiasm and\r\nmilitary acquirements displayed on this occasion, with none the less\r\npleasure because I am the citizen of another and distant State. It was\r\nnot the policy of our government to maintain large armies of navies in\r\ntime of peace. The history of our past wars established the fact that\r\nit was not needful to do so. The militia had bee found equal to all the\r\nemergencies of war. Their patriotism, their intelligence, their\r\nknowledge of the use of arms, had given to then all the efficiency of\r\nveterans, and on many bloody fields they have shown their superiority\r\nover the disciplined troops of their enemies. A people morally and\r\nintellectually equal to self-government, must also be equal in\r\nself-defence. My friends, your worthy General has alluded to my\r\nconnection with the military service of the country. The memory arose\r\nto myself when the troops this day marched past me, and when I looked\r\nupon their manly bearing and firm step. I thought could I have seen\r\nthem thus approaching the last field of battle on which I served, where\r\nthe changing tide several times threatened disaster to the American\r\nflag, with what joy I would have welcomed those striped and starred\r\nbanners, the emblem and the guide of the free and the brave, and with\r\nwhat pride would the heart have beaten when welcoming the danger’s\r\nhour, brethren from so remote an extremity of our expanded territory.\r\n\r\nOne of the evidences of the fraternal confidence and mutual reliance of\r\nour fathers was to be found in their compact or mutual protection and\r\ncommon defence. So long as their sons preserve the spirit and\r\nappreciate the purpose of their fathers, the United States will remain\r\ninvincible, their power will grow with the lapse of time, and their\r\nexample show brighter and brighter as revolving ages roll over the\r\ntemple our fathers dedicated to constitutional liberty, and founded\r\nupon truths announced to their sons, but intended for mankind. I thank\r\nyou, citizen soldiers, for this act of courtesy. It will long and\r\ngratefully be remembered, as a token of respect to the distant State of\r\nwhich I am a citizen, and I trust will be noted by others, as\r\nindicating that national sentiment which made, and which alone can\r\npreserve us a nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBanquet After Encampment at Belfast.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mayor then gave:\r\n\r\nThe heroes who have fought our country’s battles: may their services be\r\nappreciated by a grateful people.\r\n\r\nLoud calls being made for Col. Jefferson Davis, that gentleman arose\r\nand said:\r\n\r\nThe sentiment to which he was called to respond excited memories which\r\ncalled up proud emotions, though their associations were sad. He could\r\nnot reply to a compliment paid to the gallantry of his comrades in the\r\nwar with Mexico, without remembering how many of them now mingle with\r\nthe dust of a foreign land, and how many of them have sunk after the\r\nday of toil was done by reason of the exposure endured in the service\r\nof their country. The land has mourned, and still mourns, the fall of\r\nits bravest and best, and truly are our laurels mingled with the\r\ncypress, ’tis well, and ’tis wise, ’tis natural and ’tis proper, that\r\nin looking on the laurels of our glory we should pause to pay a tribute\r\nto the cypress which weeps over them, and having paid this tribute to\r\nthe gallant dead, the memory of whose service can never die, we pass to\r\nthe consideration of their acts, and the beneficial results which their\r\nsacrifices have secured. When that war begun, our history recorded\r\nevidence only of the power of our people for defence. The Fabian policy\r\nof Washington, admirably adapted to the condition of the Colonies,\r\nachieved so much in proportion to the means, that he would be rash\r\nindeed who should attempt to criticise it. The prudent, though daring\r\ncourse of Jackson, fruitful as it was of the end to be attained, did\r\nnot yet serve to illustrate the capacity of our people for the trials\r\nand the struggles attendant on the operations of an invasive war. Hence\r\nit was commonly asserted that the American people, though they might\r\nresist attack, were powerless to redress aggression which was not\r\nconnected with the invasion of their territory. The idea of reliance\r\nupon undisciplined militia was treated with contempt and derision. To\r\nborrow a simile from the pit, we were regarded as dung-hill soldiers,\r\nwho would only fight at home. In the war with Mexico our armies carried\r\ntheir banners over routes hitherto unknown, through mountain passes\r\nwhere nature had almost completed the work of defence, and penetrated\r\nfurther into the enemy’s country than any European army has ever\r\nmarched from the source of its supplies. Not to prolong the comparison\r\nby a reference to events of a remote period, he would only refer to the\r\nlast campaign in European war. The combined armies of France and\r\nEngland, after preparation worthy of their great military power,\r\nadvanced through friendly territory to the outer verge of the country,\r\nagainst which they directed a war of invasion, and after a prolonged\r\nsiege by sea and by land, finally captured a seaport town which they\r\ncould not hold. Before them lay the country they had come to invade,\r\nbut there, at the outer gate, their march was arrested, and in sight of\r\nthe ships which brought them supplies and reinforcements, they\r\nterminated a campaign, the scale and proclaimed objects of which had\r\ncaused the world to look on in expectation of achievements the like of\r\nwhich man had not seen. Why was it so? was it not that they were unable\r\nto move from the depot of supplies, though a distance less than half of\r\nthat over which our army passed before reaching a productive region\r\nwould have brought the allied forces to a country filled with all the\r\nsupplies necessary for the support of an army. Is it boastful to say\r\nthat American troops, and an American treasury, would have encountered\r\nand have overcome such an obstacle? He did not forget the complaints\r\nwhich had been made on account of the vast expenditures which had been\r\nmade in the prosecution of the war with Mexico; but he remembered with\r\npride the capacity which the country had exhibited to bear such\r\nexpenditure, and believed that our people had no money standard by\r\nwhich to measure the duty of their government, and the honor of their\r\nflag. We bear with us from the wars in which we have been engaged no\r\nother memory of their cost than the loss of the gallant dead. To the\r\nprinted reports and tabular statements we must go when we desire to\r\nknow how many dollars were expended. The successful soldier when he\r\nreturns from the field is met by a welcome proportionate to the leaves\r\nwhich he has added to the wreath of his country’s glory. Each has his\r\nreward; to one, the admiring listener at the hearthstone; to another,\r\nthe triumphal reception; to all, the respect which patriotism renders\r\nto patriotic service. To the soldier who, in the early part of the\r\nMexican war, set the seal of invincibility upon American arms, and\r\nsubsequently by a signal victory dispersed and disorganized the regular\r\narmy of Mexico, his countrymen voted the highest reward known to our\r\ngovernment. Twice before have the people in like manner manifested\r\ntheir approbation and esteem. Thus has the military spirit of the\r\ncountry been nursed; to-day it needs not the monarchial bundles of\r\nribbons, orders and titles to sustain it. Thus has the American citizen\r\nbeen made to realize that it is sweet and honorable to die for one’s\r\ncountry; and to feel proudest among his family memories of the names of\r\nthose who successfully fought or bravely died in defence of the\r\nnational flag. Often he had had occasion to feel, and to mark the\r\nmingled sensation of pride and of sorrow with which friends revert to\r\nthose who gallantly died in the field. Even at this now remote day he\r\ncould not travel in Mississippi without having the recollection of his\r\nfallen comrades painfully revived by meeting a mother who mourns her\r\nson with the agony of a mother’s grief; a father, whose stern nature\r\nvainly struggles to conceal the involuntary pang, or tender children\r\nwho know not the extent of their deprivation, though it is indeed the\r\nsorest of all. Let none then be surprised that he could not see thee\r\nlaurel save through the solemn shade of the cypress. Time, however,\r\nsoftened the shadow long before it withers the leaf. On his way to this\r\nplace he learned that it was possible, and he seized the occasion to\r\nvisit the residence of Gen. Knox, of revolutionary memory. His own\r\ndesire to see something which had been identified with a patriot\r\nsoldier who had so largely contributed to the success of the\r\nrevolution, and the establishment of the institutions we inherited, was\r\nbut an indication of the military sentiment which lives in the American\r\nheart. It turns the step of the traveller from his direct path, it\r\nattracts the boy in his first reading, it fires the ambition of the\r\nyouth, and encircles the veteran with the kindness of his neighbors,\r\nand swells the train which follows his bier when, his duty to his\r\ncountry performed, he answers the summons of his God, and is translated\r\nto a better sphere. It is that same military enthusiasm which calls you\r\nfrom the avocations and the pleasures of home to the duties and\r\ndiscomforts of the camp, that you may prepare yourselves whenever your\r\ncountry needs it to render her efficient service. On the militia of the\r\ncountry the rights of its citizens, and the honor of its flag, must\r\nmainly depend in the event of a war; they only need to be organized and\r\ninstructed to render them a secure reliance. Mingled with the great\r\nbody of the people, identified with their feelings and their interests,\r\nproud of the prowess of their fathers and jealousy careful of the\r\ncountry’s honor, if properly instructed and prepared, the first trumpet\r\ncall should bring from plain and from mountain a citizen soldiery who\r\nwould encircle the land and check the invader with a wall of fire. Your\r\nplan of encampment seems best suited to the purposes of practical\r\ninstruction. A pilgrim in search of health, his steps had been\r\nfortunately directed to Maine, the courtesy of the commander of this\r\nencampment had induced him to visit it and to review the troops. In all\r\nrespects it had been to him most gratifying. The appointments, the\r\nmovements, the stern faces, and stalwart forms of the men, spoke of the\r\npower to do, and the will to dare whatever it was needful and proper to\r\nperform. This day to manifest respect to a citizen of a distant State,\r\nwhose only claim upon them is that he has been an American soldier, and\r\nis an American citizen, they had cheerfully marched through heavy mire.\r\nSo much had they given to so small a demand on their natural sentiment,\r\nhe could not doubt they would with equal alacrity, and with the same\r\nfirm step, march over a field miry with the blood of comrade and of\r\nfoe, where opposing causes make to men a common fate.\r\n\r\nAmong the objects which were of interest to him and which he had hoped\r\nto visit, was the fortification at the narrows of the Penobscot. During\r\nthe last session of congress he had endeavored to obtain an\r\nappropriation for the completion of the work which had advanced to the\r\npoint which made it effective against shipping, but left still liable\r\nto be carried by land attack. He was not of those who thought it\r\nnecessary to raise walls wherever an enemy might land and march, for he\r\nwould say that henceforward there would remain to an invading army but\r\nto choose between captivity and a grave. To protect commercial ports\r\nagainst naval assault forts are needful and should be completed so as\r\nto render them defensible by small garrisons, and to save those\r\ngarrisons as far as possible from the sacrifice of life. Our people\r\nrequire no wall to separate them from other countries, unless it be\r\nneedful for our own restraint. Our policy is peace, and the fact shines\r\nbrightly on the pages of our history that not one acre of its extensive\r\nacquisitions have been claimed as the spoil of the sword. Unpeopled\r\ndeserts have been purchased, and on its own application a community has\r\nbeen admitted to our family of states. But we have offered to the world\r\nthe singular example of conquered territory returned to the vanquished.\r\n\r\nPermit me in this connection, whilst ever mindful of the just relation\r\nand necessity for concurrent action between the civil and military\r\ndepartments of government, to bear testimony to the value of the\r\nmilitia for the purposes of peace. The principle of self-government and\r\nthe spirit of independence are so deep rooted in the American mind that\r\nour people would illy brook the enforcement of law by any extraneous\r\npower, and it is to be hoped we never will see a case in which the\r\npeople of a State will not be able to maintain the civil authority, and\r\nvindicate offended law against all opposers whomsoever. To give energy\r\nand activity to such popular action the organization of the militia\r\nwill be most convenient whenever force shall be needful. It is not a\r\nlittle remarkable that though the first Presidents in emphatic language\r\nfrom time to time recommended a thorough organization of the militia as\r\none of the most important duties of the government, but little more has\r\nyet been done than to make provisions for supplying them with arms, and\r\nfor calling them out when required for federal purposes. There is a\r\nmoral effect arising from the spectacle of each State possessed of a\r\nbody of instructed militia, ready not only to maintain its government\r\nat home, but to unite with the militia of other States and to form an\r\narmy upon which all can rely whenever a common danger calls for a\r\ncommon defence. It has been thus that from time to time the fraternity\r\nof our revolutionary fathers has been renewed among their sons, and\r\nadditional assurance has been given that the sentiment of nationality\r\non which our Union was founded could never die. That the expansion of\r\nthe circle did not weaken its cohesive power, nor the piling of arch\r\nupon arch endanger the foundation on which our political temple was\r\nbuilt. It was not a structure of expediency; master workmen cleared\r\naway the surface where the errors and prejudices of ages had\r\naccumulated, dug deep down to the unmutable rock of truth, and with\r\nunchanging principles constructed the walls to stand till time should\r\nbecome eternity. Who is there, then, forgetful of his revolutionary\r\ndescent, insensible to the pride which the name of the United States\r\njustly inspires, faithless to the duty which the bond of his fathers\r\nimposes, and reckless of all which the honorable discharge of that duty\r\nensures, would unite with impious purpose to destroy that foundation,\r\nand strive, with sacrilegious hand to tear the flag under which we had\r\nmarched from colonial dependence to our present national greatness.\r\nAway with speculative theories, and false philanthropy of abstractions,\r\nwhich tend to destroy one half, one third, aye, or a single star of\r\nthat bright constellation which lights the pathway of our future\r\ncareer, and sends a hopeful ray through the clouds of despotism which\r\nhang over less favored lands.\r\n\r\nOur mission is not that of propagandists—our principles forbid\r\ninterference with the institutions of other countries; but we may hope\r\nthat our example will be imitated, and should so live that this model\r\nof representative liberty, community independence, and government\r\nderived from the consent of the governed, and limited by a written\r\ncompact, should commend itself to the adoption of others. We now stand\r\nisolated among the great nations of the earth; the opposition of\r\nmonarchial governments to the theory on which ours is founded, points\r\nto the possibility of an alliance against us, by which what is termed\r\nnational law may be modified and warped to our prejudice if not to our\r\nassailment. It needs the united power, harmonious action and\r\nconcentrated will of the people of all these States to roll the wheel\r\nof progress to the end which our fathers contemplated, and which their\r\nsons, if they are wise and true, may behold. May the kindness and\r\ncourtesy which have characterized the present occasion on which\r\nMississippi has been greeted by Maine, be a type of the feeling which\r\nshall ever exist between the extremes of our common country. From\r\nFlorida to California, from Oregon to Maine, from the centre to the\r\nremotest border, may the possessors of our constitutional heritage\r\nappreciate its value, and faithfully, fraternally labor for its\r\nthorough development, looking back to the original compact for the\r\npurposes for which the Union was established, and forward to the\r\nblessing which such union was designed and is competent to confer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeech at the Portland Meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it became known that Mr. Davis had arrived at the Hall, he was\r\nloudly called for. Hon. Joseph Howard, chairman of the meeting, then\r\nintroduced Mr. Davis, who, on coming forward, was greeted with cheer\r\nupon cheer from the vast audience. As soon as the prolonged and\r\nenthusiastic applause with which he was welcomed had subsided, Mr.\r\nDavis, addressing the audience as fellow citizens and Democratic\r\nbrethren, said that the invitation with which he had been favored to\r\naddress them, evinced a purpose to confer together for the common\r\ngood—for the maintenance of the constitution, the bond of union. He\r\nwould not be expected to discuss local questions; he would not in this\r\nimitate the mischievous agitators who inflame the Northern mind against\r\nthe Southern States. He came among them, an invalid, advised by his\r\nphysician to resort to this clime for the restoration of his health; as\r\nan American citizen, he had not expected that his right to come here\r\nwould be questioned; as a stranger, or if not entirely so, known mainly\r\nby the detraction which the ardent advocacy of the rights of the South\r\nhad brought upon him, he had supposed that neither his coming nor his\r\ngoing would attract attention. But his anticipations had proved\r\nerroneous. The polite, the manly, elevated men, lifted above the\r\nbarbarism which makes stranger and enemy convertible terms, had chosen,\r\nwithout political distinction, to welcome his coming, and by constant\r\nacts of generous hospitality to make his sojourn as pleasant as his\r\nphysical condition would permit.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, men who make a trade of politics, and whose capital\r\nconsists in the denunciation of the institutions of other States, had\r\nerroneously judged him by themselves, and had regarded his coming as a\r\npolitical mission; wherefore it was, he was led to suppose, that the\r\nscavengers of that party had been employed in the publication of\r\nfalsehoods, both in relation to himself and his political friends at\r\nthe South.\r\n\r\nSo far as it affected him personally their attacks were no more than\r\nthe barking of a cur, which, by its clamor, indicates the inhospitable\r\ncharacter of the master who keeps him. If his friends and himself were,\r\nas had been falsely charged, Disunionists and Nullifiers, they might\r\nnaturally have looked for kinder considerations from a party which\r\ncirculates petitions for a “prompt and peaceful dissolution of the\r\nUnion” on account of the incompatibility of the sections—from a party,\r\nwhich, having proved faithless to the obligation of the constitution in\r\nrelation to the fugitive from service or labor, then declares null and\r\nvoid the law which their dereliction made it necessary for Congress to\r\nenact. The fealty of himself and friends to the constitution, and their\r\nhonorable discharge of its obligations was their rebuke to this party,\r\nin whose hostility he found the highest commendation in their power to\r\nbestow.\r\n\r\nBy reckless fabrication, by garbling and inserting new words into\r\nextracts, they had attempted to deceive the people here as to his\r\nopinions, and had crowned the fraud by the absurd announcement that his\r\nwas the creed on which the people of Maine must vote next Monday.\r\n\r\nIt was due to the hospitality which he had received at their hands that\r\nhe should not interfere in their domestic affairs, and he had not\r\nfailed to remember the obligation; when republicans had introduced the\r\nsubject of African slavery he had defended it, and answered pharisaical\r\npretensions by citing the Bible, the constitution of the United States\r\nand the good of society in justification of the institutions of the\r\nState of which he was a citizen; in this he but exercised the right of\r\na freeman and discharged the duty of a Southern citizen. Was it for\r\nthis cause that he had been signalized as a slavery propagandists? He\r\nadmitted in all its length and breadth the right of the people of Maine\r\nto decide the question for themselves; he held that it would be an\r\nindecent interference, on the part of a citizen of another State, if he\r\nshould arraign the propriety of the judgment they had rendered, and\r\nthat there was no rightful power in the federal government or in all\r\nthe States combined, to set aside the decision which the community had\r\nmade in relation to their domestic institutions. Should any attempt be\r\nmade thus to disturb their sovereign right, he would pledge himself in\r\nadvance, as a State-rights man, with his head, his heart and his hand,\r\nif need be, to aid them in the defence of this right of community\r\nindependence, which the Union was formed to protect, and which it was\r\nthe duty of every American citizen to preserve and to guard as the\r\npeculiar and prominent feature of our government.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, this accusation? Do they fear to allow Southern men to\r\nconverse with their philosophers, and seek thus to silence or exclude\r\nthem? He trusted others would contemn them as he did, and that many of\r\nour brethren of the South would, like himself, learn by sojourn here,\r\nto appreciate the true men of Maine, and to know how little are the\r\npolitical abolitionists and the abolition papers the exponents of the\r\ncharacter and the purposes of the Democracy of this State.\r\n\r\nAnd now having brushed away the cob-webs which lay in his path, he\r\nwould proceed to the consideration of subjects worthy of the audience\r\nhe had the honor to address.\r\n\r\nDemocrats, patriots, by whatever political name any of you may be\r\nknown, you have a sacred duty to perform to your ancestry and to\r\nposterity. The time is at hand when for good or for evil, the questions\r\nwhich have agitated the public mind are to be solved. Is it true as\r\nasserted by northern agitators that there is such contrariety between\r\nthe North and the South that they cannot remain united! Or rather, is\r\nit not true as our fathers deemed it, that diversity in the character\r\nof the population, in the products and in the institutions of the\r\nseveral States formed a reason for their union and tended to secure to\r\ntheir posterity the liberty which was the common object of their love,\r\nand by cultivating untrammeled intercourse and free trade between the\r\nStates, to duplicate the comforts of all?\r\n\r\nThere was a time when the test of patriotism was the readiness to sever\r\nthe bond which bound the colonies to the mother country. Recently our\r\npeople with joyous acclamation have welcomed the connection of the\r\nUnited States with Great Britain, by the Atlantic cable. The one is not\r\ninconsistent with the other. When the home government violated the\r\ncharters of the colonies, and assumed to control the private interests\r\nof individuals, the love of political liberty, the determination at\r\nwhatever hazard to maintain their rights, led our fathers to enter on\r\nthe trial of revolution. Having achieved the separation, they did what\r\nwas in their power for the development of commerce. They secured free\r\ntrade between the States, without surrendering State independence.\r\nTheir sons, not only free, but beyond the possibility of future\r\ninterference in their domestic affairs, now seek the closest commercial\r\nconnection with the country from which their fathers achieved a\r\npolitical separation.\r\n\r\nHad the proposition been made to consolidate the States after their\r\nindependence had been achieved, all must know it would have been\r\nrejected—yet there are those who now instigate you to sectional strife\r\nfor the purpose of sectional dominion and the destruction of the rights\r\nof the minority. Do they mean treason to the Constitution and the\r\ndestruction of the Union? Or do they vilely practice on credulity and\r\npassion for personal gain? The latter is suggested by the contradictory\r\ncourse they pursue. At the same time they proclaim war upon the slave\r\nproperty of the South, they ask for protection to the manufactures of\r\nthe staple which could not be produced if that property did not exist.\r\nAnd while they assert themselves to be the peculiar friends of commerce\r\nand navigation, they vaunt their purpose to destroy the labor which\r\ngives vitality to both; whilst they proclaim themselves the peculiar\r\nfriends of laboring men at the North, they insist that the negroes are\r\ntheir equals; and if they are sincere they would, by emancipation of\r\nthe blacks, bring them together and degrade the white man to the negro\r\nlevel. They seek to influence the northern mind by sectional issues and\r\nsectional organization, yet they profess to be the friends of the\r\nUnion. The Union voluntarily formed by free, equal, independent States.\r\n\r\nWe of the South, on a sectional division, are in the minority; and if\r\nlegislation is to be directed by geographical tests—if the constitution\r\nis to be trampled in the dust, and the unbridled will of the majority\r\nin Congress is to be supreme over the States; we should have the\r\nproblem which was presented to our Fathers when the Colonies declined\r\nto be content with a mere representation in parliament.\r\n\r\nIf the constitution is to be sacredly observed, why should there be a\r\nstruggle for sectional ascendency? The instrument is the same in all\r\nlatitudes, and does not vary with the domestic institutions of the\r\nseveral States. Hence it is that the Democracy, the party of the\r\nconstitution, have preserved their integrity, and are to-day the only\r\nnational party and the only hope for the preservation and perpetuation\r\nof the Union of the States.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson denominated the Democracy of the North, the natural\r\nallies of the South. It is in our generation doubly true; they are\r\nstill the party with whom labor is capital, and they are now the party\r\nwhich stands by the barriers of the constitution, to protect them from\r\nthe waves of fanatical and sectional aggression. The use of the word\r\naggression reminded him that the people here have been daily harangued\r\nabout the aggressions of the slave power, and he had been curious to\r\nlearn what was so described. It is, if he had learned correctly, the\r\nassertion of the right to migrate with slaves into the territories of\r\nthe United States. Is this aggression? If so, upon what? Not upon those\r\nwho desire close association with the negro; not upon territorial\r\nrights, unless these self-styled lovers of the Union have already\r\ndissolved it and have taken the territories to themselves. The\r\nterritory being the common property of States, equals in the Union, and\r\nbound by the constitution which recognizes property in slaves, it is an\r\nabuse of terms to call aggression the migration into that territory of\r\none of its joint owners, because carrying with him any species of\r\nproperty recognized by the constitution of the United States. The\r\nFederal government has no power to declare what is property anywhere.\r\nThe power of each State cannot extend beyond its own limits. As a\r\nconsequence, therefore, whatever is property in any of the States must\r\nbe so considered in any of the territories of the United States until\r\nthey reach to the dignity of community independence, when the subject\r\nmatter will be entirely under the control of the people and be\r\ndetermined by their fundamental law. If the inhabitants of any\r\nterritory should refuse to enact such laws and police regulations as\r\nwould give security to their property or to his, it would be rendered\r\nmore or less valueless, in proportion to the difficulty of holding it\r\nwithout such protection. In the case of property in the labor of man,\r\nor what is usually called slave property, the insecurity would be so\r\ngreat that the owner could not ordinarily retain it. Therefore, though\r\nthe right would remain, the remedy being withheld, it would follow that\r\nthe owner would be practically debarred by the circumstances of the\r\ncase, from taking slave property into a territory where the sense of\r\nthe inhabitants was opposed to its introduction. So much for the oft\r\nrepeated fallacy of forcing slavery upon any community.\r\n\r\nIf Congress had the power to prohibit the introduction of slave\r\nproperty into the territories, what would be the purpose? Would it be\r\nto promote emancipation? That could not be the effect. In the first\r\nsettlement of a territory the want of population and the consequent\r\ndifficulty of procuring hired labor, would induce emigrants to take\r\nslaves with them; but if the climate and products of the country were\r\nunsuited to African labor—as soon as white labor flowed in, the owners\r\nof slaves would as a matter of interest, desire to get rid of them and\r\nemancipation would result. The number would usually be so small that\r\nthis would be effected without injury to society or industrial\r\npursuits. Thus it was in Wisconsin, notwithstanding the ordinance of\r\n’87; and other examples might be cited to show that this is not mere\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nWould it be to promote the civilization and progress of the negro race?\r\nThe tendency must be otherwise. By the dispersion of the slaves, their\r\nlabor would be rendered more productive and their comforts increased.\r\nThe number of owners would be multiplied, and by more immediate contact\r\nand personal relation greater care and kindness would be engendered. In\r\nevery way it would conduce to the advancement and happiness of the\r\nservile caste.\r\n\r\nNo—no—it is not these, but the same answer which comes to every inquiry\r\nas to the cause of fanatical agitation. ’Tis for sectional power, and\r\npolitical ascendency; to fan a sectional hostility, which must be, as\r\nit has been, injurious to all, and beneficial to none. For what\r\npatriotic purpose can the Northern mind be agitated in relation to\r\ndomestic institutions, for which they have no legal or moral\r\nresponsibility, and from the interference with which they are\r\nrestrained by their obligations as American citizens?\r\n\r\nIs it in this mode that the spirit of mutual support and common effort\r\nfor the common good, is to be cultivated? Is it thus that confidence is\r\nto be developed and the sense of security to grow with the growing\r\npower of each and every State? Is it thus that we are to exemplify the\r\nblessings of self-government by the free exercise in each independent\r\ncommunity of the power to regulate their domestic institutions as soil,\r\nclimate, and population may determine?\r\n\r\nAmong the questions which have been made the basis of recent agitation,\r\nand has contributed as much, perhaps, as any other to popular delusion,\r\nwas the act known as the Missouri Compromise. It will be remembered\r\nthat the agitation of 1819 on the subject of slavery, was not masked as\r\nit has been since, by pretensions of philanthropy—it was an avowed\r\nopposition to the admission of a slave-holding State. A long and bitter\r\ncontroversy was terminated by the admission of the State of Missouri,\r\nand the prohibition of slavery north of the parallel of 36 deg. 30\r\nminutes. He, and those with whom he most concurred, had always\r\ncontended that Congress had no constitutional power to make the\r\ninterdiction. But the people having generally acquiesced, the matter\r\nwas considered settled; and when Texas, a slave-holding State, was\r\nadmitted into the Union, Southern men, regarding the Missouri Act as a\r\ncompact, assented to the extension of the line through the territory of\r\nTexas, with a provision that any State formed out of the territory\r\nnorth of 36: 30: should be non-slaveholding. But when, at a subsequent\r\nperiod, we made extensive acquisitions from Mexico, and it was proposed\r\nto divide the territory by the same parallel, the North generally\r\nopposed it, and after a long discussion, the controversy was settled on\r\nthe principle of non-intervention by Congress in relation to property\r\nin the territories. The line of the Missouri Compromise was repudiated.\r\nAnd a Senator who had been most prominent in denouncing the repeal of\r\nthe Missouri Compromise as a violation of good faith on the part of the\r\nSouth, in 1850, described it as a measure which had been the grave of\r\nevery Northern man who supported it, and objected to the boundary of\r\n36: 30: for the territory of Utah, because of the political implication\r\nwhich its adoption would contain.\r\n\r\nThe act having been thus signally repudiated by the denial in every\r\nform of the power of Congress to fix geographical limits within which\r\nslavery might or might not exist; when it became necessary to organize\r\nthe territories of Kansas and Nebraska, it was but the corollary of the\r\nproposition which had been maintained in 1850 to repeal the act which\r\nhad fixed the parallel of 36: 30: as the future limit of slavery in the\r\nterritory of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nConsistency demanded so much; fairness and manhood could not have\r\ngranted less. He was not then a member of Congress; but if he had been,\r\nhe should have voted for that repeal; for although in 1850 he had\r\nfavored the extension of the Missouri Compromise line to the Pacific\r\nOcean, and believed that it would most conduce to the harmony of the\r\nStates, he had yielded to the action of the Government, and considered\r\nthe position then taken as conclusive against the retention of the line\r\nin Louisiana and Texas, which its beneficiaries had refused to extend\r\nthrough the territories acquired from Mexico. As a general principle,\r\nhe thought it was best to leave the territories all open. Equality of\r\nright demanded it, and the federal government had no power to withhold\r\nit. Whatever validity the Missouri Compromise act had, it derived from\r\nthe acquiescence of the people. After 1850 then it had none. The South\r\nhad not asked Congress to extend slavery into the territories, and he\r\nin common with most Southern statesmen, denied the existence of any\r\npower to do so. He held it to be the creed of the Democracy, both in\r\nthe North and the South, that the General Government had no\r\nconstitutional power either to establish or prohibit slavery anywhere;\r\na grant of power to do the one must necessarily have involved the power\r\nto do the other. Hence it is their policy not to interfere on the one\r\nside or the other, but protecting each individual in his constitutional\r\nrights, to leave every independent community to determine and adjust\r\nall domestic questions as in their wisdom may seem best.\r\n\r\nPoliticians of the opposite school seemed to forget the relation of the\r\nGeneral Government to the States; even so far as to argue as though the\r\nGeneral Government had been the creator instead of the creature of the\r\nStates. He had learned that attempts had been made to impress upon the\r\npeople of Maine the belief that they were in danger of having slavery\r\nestablished among them by decree of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates. He scarcely knew how to answer so palpable an absurdity. The\r\ncourt was established, among other purposes, to protect the people from\r\nunconstitutional legislation; and if Congress, in the extreme of\r\nmadness, should attempt thus to invade the sovereignty of a State, it\r\nwould be within the power, and would be the duty of the court, to check\r\nthe aggression by declaring such law void. The court have, on more than\r\none occasion, asserted the right of transit as a consequence of the\r\nguarantees of the Constitution, but it would require much ingenuity to\r\ntorture the protection of a traveller or sojourner into an assertion of\r\na right to become resident and introduce property in contravention of\r\nthe fundamental law of the State, or of a citizen to hold property\r\nwithin a State in violation of its constitution and its policy. The\r\nerror of the proposition was so palpable that, like the truth of an\r\naxiom, it could not be rendered plainer by demonstration.\r\n\r\nIt is not within the scope of human foresight to see the embarrassments\r\nwhich may arise in the execution of any policy. When it was declared\r\nthat soil, climate, and unrestrained migration should be left to fix\r\nthe _status_ of the territories, and institutions of the States to be\r\nformed out of them, no one probably anticipated that companies would be\r\nincorporated to transport colonists into a territory with a view to\r\ndecide its political condition. Congress, as he believed, yielding too\r\nfar to the popular idea, had surrendered its right of revision and thus\r\nhad recently lost its power to restrain improper legislation in the\r\nterritories. From these joint causes had arisen the unhappy strife in\r\nKansas, which at one time threatened to terminate in civil war. The\r\nGovernment had been denounced for the employment of United States\r\ntroops. Very briefly he would state the case.\r\n\r\nThe movement of the Emigrant Aid Societies of the North was met by\r\ncounteracting movements in Missouri and other Southern States. Thus\r\nopposing tides of emigration met on the plains of Kansas. The land was\r\na scene of confusion and violence. Fortunately the murders which for a\r\ntime filled the newspapers, existed nowhere else; and the men who were\r\nreported slain, usually turned up after a short period to enjoy the\r\neulogies which their martyrdom had elicited. But arson, theft and\r\ndisgraceful scenes of disorder did really exist, and bands of armed men\r\nindicated the approach of actual hostilities. What was the Government\r\nto do? Perhaps you will say, call out the militia. But that would have\r\nbeen to feed and arm one of the parties for the destruction of the\r\nother. To call out the militia of neighboring States would have been\r\nbut little better. The sectional excitement then ran so high, that they\r\nwould probably have met upon the fields of Kansas as combatants, the\r\ngovernment in the meantime furnishing the supplies for both armies. It\r\nwas necessary to have a force—one which would be free from sectional\r\nexcitement or partisan zeal and under executive control. The army\r\nfulfiled these conditions. It was therefore employed. It dispersed\r\nmarauding parties, disarmed organized invaders, arrested disturbers of\r\nthe peace, gave comparative quiet and repose to the territory, without\r\ntaking a single life, aye, or shedding one drop of blood. The end\r\njustified the means, and the result equaled all that could have been\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\nThe anomalous condition of a territory possessing full legislative\r\npower, but not invested with the sovereignty of a State, justified the\r\nanxiety exhibited by Congress to be relieved from the embarrassment\r\nwhich the case of Kansas presented. The Senate passed a bill to\r\nauthorize a convention for the preparation of a constitution for the\r\nadmission of Kansas as a State. It however failed in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and the legislature of Kansas, availing themselves of\r\nthe plenary power conferred upon them by the organic act, proceeded to\r\nprovide for the assembling of a convention, and the formation of a\r\nconstitution. The law was minute and fair in its provisions, so nearly\r\nresembling the bill of the Senate that the one was probably copied from\r\nthe other. It seemed to secure to every legal voter every desirable\r\nopportunity to exercise his right. One of the parties of the territory,\r\nhowever, denying the legal existence of the legislature, chose to\r\nabstain from voting. The other elected the delegates who formed the\r\nconstitution. The validity of the instrument he has been denied,\r\nbecause it was not submitted for popular ratification. He held this\r\nposition to be wholly untenable, and could but regard it as a gross\r\ndeparture from the principle of popular sovereignty. A people—he used\r\nthe word in its strict political sense—having the right to make for\r\nthemselves their fundamental law, may either assemble in mass\r\nconvention for that purpose, or may select delegates and limit their\r\npower to the preparation of an instrument to be submitted to a popular\r\ndecision; or they may appoint delegates with full powers to frame the\r\nfundamental law of the land. Whether they adopt one mode or the other\r\nis a question with which others have no right to interfere, and he who\r\nclaims for Congress the power to sit in judgment on the manner in which\r\na people may form a constitution, is outside of the barrier which would\r\nrestrain him from claiming for Congress the right to dictate the\r\ninstrument itself. If the right existed to form a constitution at all,\r\nthe power of Congress in relation to the instrument was limited to the\r\nsimple inquiry: is it republican? In this view of the case it would not\r\nmatter to him the ninety-ninth part of a hair whether a people should\r\nchose to admit or exclude slave property. Their right to enter the\r\nUnion would be a thing apart from that consideration.\r\n\r\nHe had felt great doubt as to the propriety of admitting Kansas, and\r\nhad only yielded those doubts to the peculiar necessities which seemed\r\nto make the case exceptional. The inhabitants of the territory had\r\nhowever decided not to enter the Union upon the terms proposed, and he\r\nthought their decision was fortunate. They had not the requisite\r\npopulation; their resources were too limited to give assurance that\r\nthey would be able to bear the expenses of their government and\r\nproperly to perform the duties of a State. But more than this, their\r\nlegislative history shows that they are wanting in the essential\r\ncharacteristics of a community; whichever party has had the control of\r\nthe legislature, has manifested by its acts not a desire to promote the\r\npublic good, and protect individual rights, but a purpose to war upon\r\ntheir political opponents as a hostile power. The political party with\r\nwhich he most sympathized had marked its legislation by requiring test\r\noaths, offensive to all our notions of political freedom; and the other\r\nparty had assumed to take from the territorial executive the control of\r\nthe militia and to place it in irresponsible hands, where, it reports\r\nspeak truly, it has been employed in the most wanton outrages and\r\ndisgraceful persecution of citizens of the opposite political party. He\r\nheld, therefore, that the decision of the inhabitants was fortunate and\r\nwise. It was well, that before they assume the responsibilities of a\r\nState, they should gather population, develop the natural resources of\r\nthe country, and above all acquire the homogeneous character which\r\nwould give security to person and property, and fit them to be justly\r\ndenominated a community.\r\n\r\nA stranger, and but a passing observer of events in Maine, he had\r\nnevertheless seen indications of a reaction in popular opinion, which\r\npromised hopefully for the future of Democracy, _hopefully_, it might\r\nbe permitted for one to say who believed that the success of the\r\nDemocracy was the only hope for the maintenance of the constitution and\r\nthe perpetuation of the Union which sprung from and cannot outlive it.\r\nIf the language of his friend who preceded him should prove prophetic,\r\nthe waving of the banner he described would be the dawning of a day\r\nwhich would bring gladness and confidence to many a heart now clouded\r\nwith distrust, and loud would be the cheers which, on distant plain and\r\nmountain, would welcome Maine again to her position on the top of the\r\nDemocratic pyramid. He saw a brighter sky above him; he felt a firmer\r\nfoundation beneath his feet, and hoped ere long through a triumph\r\nachieved by the declaration of principles, suited to every latitude and\r\nlongitude of the United Slates, to receive the assurance that we have\r\npassed the breakers —that our ship may henceforth float freely on—that\r\nour flag, no longer threatened with mutilation or destruction, shall\r\nthrow its broad stripes to the breeze and gather stars until its\r\nconstellation shines a galaxy, and records a family of States embracing\r\nthe new world and its adjacent islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeech at State Fair at Augusta, ME.\r\n\r\n[From the Eastern Argus, Sept 29,1858.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thursday evening a large and brilliant audience assembled in the\r\nRepresentatives’ Hall, in the Capitol, to listen to the distinguished\r\nstatesman from Mississippi, who, upon brief notice and without a\r\nmoment’s leisure for preparation, had kindly consented to address the\r\nAgricultural Society. We have already spoken of the gratifying\r\ncharacter of what he termed his desultory remarks and of the cordially\r\nenthusiastic manner in which both the orator and his address were\r\nreceived. As the occasion, as well as the character of the remarks,\r\nwill make them interesting to the whole people of our State, we are\r\ngratified in being able to lay before our readers a more extended and\r\naccurate report of them than has before appeared.\r\n\r\nAt about half-past eight o’clock, the Society came into the Hall,\r\nalready crowded in every part, and its President, Hon. Samuel F.\r\nPerley, in brief and complimentary terms, introduced Col. Davis, who\r\nadvanced to the speaker’s stand, and was received with loud and\r\nprolonged applause. He said:\r\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen, friends and countrymen: To the many acts of\r\nkindness received from the people of Maine, I have to add the welcome\r\nreception this evening. The invitation of the Agricultural Society,\r\nwith the attendant circumstances, serve further to impress me with the\r\nhospitality of ray fellow citizens of this State. Coming here, an\r\ninvalid, seeking the benefits which your clime would afford, and\r\npreceded by a reputation which was expected to prejudice you\r\nunfavorably towards me, I have everywhere met courtesy and considerate\r\nattention, from the hour I landed on your coast to the present time. It\r\nwas natural to ask, whence come these manifestations? Is it because the\r\nopinion which had been formed has been found to be unjust, and the\r\nreaction has been in proportion to the previous impulse? Or is it the\r\nexhibition of your regard for loyalty to one’s friends, and devotion by\r\na citizen to the community to which he belongs? Either the one or the\r\nother is honorable to you; but there is a broader and more beneficent\r\nmotive—the prompting of that sentiment which would cause you to\r\nrecognize in every American citizen a brother. That feeling which\r\nDaniel Webster indicated when he met me in company with your\r\ndistinguished townsman, ex-Senator Bradbury, and taking us with the\r\nright hand and with the left, said in the peculiarly impressive manner\r\nwhich belonged to him, “My brethren of the North and of the South, how\r\nare ye?”\r\n\r\nIt is usual to offer to an Agricultural Society nothing less than a\r\nprepared address, and had I come with an intention to speak to you, I\r\nshould not have failed to make that preparation which is evidence of\r\ndue regard for the audience. The invitation under which I now speak,\r\nhaving been given and accepted this evening, I have no power to do more\r\nthan to offer you desultory remarks on such subjects as my visit to the\r\nFair have suggested, and which may occur to me as I progress.\r\n\r\nWith great pleasure I have witnessed evidences of much attention and\r\ndeep interest in agriculture. It is the basis of all wealth. It is the\r\nproducer—brings all new contributions to the general store. The\r\nmechanic arts are essential to its success, and they serve by changing\r\nthe form, to multiply the value of agricultural products. And commerce\r\ntoo, by exchanging the products of individuals and of countries,\r\nenhances the value of labor, and increases the comfort of man. They are\r\nall essential to each other. I have no disposition to magnify or\r\ndepreciate either, but my proposition is, that the soil is the source\r\nfrom which human wealth springs. In addition to these pursuits, society\r\nrequires what are termed liberal professions. They are not producers,\r\nthough they may contribute, by diffusing knowledge, to increase\r\nproduction. They may be necessary to give security to property and to\r\ntake care of some physical wants. For instance you have lawyers and\r\ndoctors; and the less need you have of them the better; for though\r\nnecessary, like government, it is evil which makes them so. As to\r\nanother class—those who have the cure of souls—their mission is so\r\nsacred, their function so high as to place them beyond comment; and of\r\nthem I have nothing to say, except that I propose to say nothing.\r\n\r\nAmong the products of agriculture I of course intended to include the\r\nfarmer’s stock, and I must here bear my tribute of admiration to the\r\nfine display which has been made of horned cattle; particularly of work\r\noxen, remarkable for their size, their adaptation to the purposes for\r\nwhich they are kept and the docility and yet the unflagging spirit\r\nwhich they manifested in the trials of strength and of deep ploughing.\r\nI have not before seen such fine specimens of the Devon cattle,—of\r\ncourse I speak of them as they present themselves to the eye—not\r\npretending to judge of their relative value to other stock exhibited.\r\nImprovement in the breed of domestic animals goes hand in hand with\r\nagricultural mechanism, to give the ability to make two blades of grass\r\nto grow where but one grew before, and thus to render you indeed\r\nbenefactors. Skill in the use, and ingenuity in devising and\r\nconstructing implements, serve to render labor productive, and relieve\r\nit of its most dreary drudgery. It is this mechanical ingenuity which\r\nhas compensated for the high price of labor among us, and aided in the\r\ndevelopment of resources which makes our country the greatest of the\r\nearth. Blest by soil, climate and government, if we are, as claimed,\r\npre-eminent among nations, it is because we have added to other\r\nadvantages a more general cultivation of the mind. The superiority is\r\nattributable not so much to physical energy, activity and perseverance,\r\nas to the improvement of that portion of the man which lies above the\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nThough you have done much for the improvement of agricultural\r\nimplements, your work is far from being completed. It is not a little\r\nsurprising that we should, to this day, have no reliable rule by which\r\nto make a plough, and though the model has been improved, certainly it\r\nis yet not unlike, and so far as exact science is concerned, is on a\r\npar with that implement as used by the Romans, and as it appeared in\r\nancient architecture; the form, proportion and angular relation of the\r\nparts, and the adjustment of the whole to the power to be applied,\r\noffer problems alike interesting to the mechanic, and useful to the\r\ncultivator. In your ploughing matches sufficient evidence was afforded\r\nof the fitness of the implements employed to turn deep and wide\r\nfurrows; but should we be content with such result as is obtained by\r\ntrying different models, and then copying one which is found to be\r\ngood?\r\n\r\nMaine was so richly endowed with harbors and forests of ship timber\r\nthat it was naturally to be expected, as it has fallen out, that the\r\npursuits of navigation would most occupy the attention of her people.\r\nBut let not her sons look to the period when her forests have\r\ndisappeared as that beyond which her prosperity may not continue. There\r\nare large tracts of land which when labor is no longer directed to\r\nlumber, will become, in the hands of the farmer, what the valley of the\r\nKennebec now is. The land may not offer soil so deep as alluvial\r\ndistricts, nor be at first as productive as those on which a deep\r\nvegetable mould has accumulated, yet its productiveness may not be less\r\npermanent than those. In them the elements which support the farmer’s\r\ncrop may be exhausted by cultivation or carried down into substrata of\r\ngravel or sand. In the remote West to which so many are pressing, the\r\nemigrant will encounter an arid climate in which irrigation is\r\nnecessary to ensure a return for the labor of husbandry, and this\r\ninvolves an original expenditure which it will usually require large\r\ncapital to bear. In this climate the sun, like a mighty pump, is daily\r\nraising the water which the currents of cold air from the mountains, or\r\nfrom the sea, precipitate in the form of genial showers during the\r\nperiod of your growing crops; and the granite of the mountains slowly,\r\nbut steadily disintegrating, gives up its fertilizing property to be\r\nscattered by unseen hands over plain and over valley. With care and\r\nwith skill in its use I can see no end to the productiveness of that\r\nportion of your land which is fit for cultivation.\r\n\r\nYour crops, and your mode of tillage are different from that to which I\r\nam accustomed, and the result is that each supplies a different segment\r\nin the circle of man’s wants. I am glad that it is so, that it must\r\nnecessarily be so. Glad, because it is an everlasting bond between us;\r\none which, whilst it binds, renders both doubly prosperous. Blessed is\r\nour lot in this, that our fathers linked us together, and established\r\nfree trade between us. In the diversity of climate, and of crops, there\r\nis an assurance that entire failure cannot occur. If disaster and\r\nblight should fall upon one section, it need not go to a foreign land\r\nin search of bread. Famine, gaunt famine, with its skeleton step, can\r\nnever pass our borders whilst the free trade of the Union continues.\r\n\r\nBut difference in pursuits, in population, and domestic institutions,\r\nhave been made the basis of hostile agitation, and urged as a cause of\r\nseparation. To my mind the reverse would be the rational conclusion.\r\nEach exchanging, the surplus of that which it can best produce for the\r\nsurplus of another which it most requires, the benefit must be mutual,\r\nand the advantage common. Here is a commercial, a selfish bond to hold\r\nus together. But I will stop here, because the current of my thought is\r\ncarrying me beyond the limit of topics proper to the occasion, and I\r\nmust offer as an apology the fact, that though myself a cultivator of\r\nthe soil, my mind has for several years been given so much to political\r\nsubjects, that in speaking without having previously arranged what to\r\nsay, the thought inadvertently runs from the matter I wished to\r\npresent, into collateral questions of governmental concern. Before\r\nturning back, however, into the original channel, permit me to say that\r\nthe diversity of which I have been speaking, formed no small inducement\r\nto the union of the States, and that it has been through that union\r\nthat we have attained to our present position, and stand to-day, all\r\nthings considered, the happiest, and among the greatest in the family\r\nof nations.\r\n\r\nIn looking around upon the evidences you have brought of mechanical and\r\nagricultural improvement, I have viewed it not with the curiosity of a\r\nstranger, but with the interest of one who felt that he had a part in\r\nit, as an exhibition of the prosperity of his country. The whole\r\nconfederacy is my country, and to the innermost fibres of my heart I\r\nlove it all, and every part. I could not if I would, and would not if I\r\ncould, dwarf myself to mere sectionality. My first allegiance is to the\r\nState of which I am a citizen, and to which by affection and\r\nassociation I am personally bound; but this does not obstruct the\r\nperception of your greatness, or admiration for much which I have found\r\nadmirable among you.\r\n\r\nYankee is a word once applied to you as a term of reproach, but you\r\nhave made it honorable and renowned. You have borne the flag of your\r\ncountry from the time when it was ridiculed as a piece of striped\r\nbunting, until it has come to be known and respected wherever the ray\r\nof civilization has reached; and your canvass-winged birds of commerce\r\nhave borne civilization into regions, where it is not boasting to say,\r\nbut for your prowess it would not have gone. You have a right to be\r\nproud of your achievements as well on the land as the sea. Well may you\r\npoint as you do with satisfaction, to your school houses and your\r\nwork-shops, and to the fruits they have borne on the forum and in the\r\ncouncil chamber, and in the manufactures which have increased the\r\ncomforts of our own people, and have encircled the globe to find\r\nexchangeable products required at home. Those are the greatest and most\r\nbeneficent triumphs—the triumph of mind over matter. These are the\r\nmonuments of greatness, which resist both time and circumstance.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of diversity among the people of the United States; yet\r\nthere is probably greater similitude than is to be found elsewhere over\r\nthe same extent of country, and in the same number of people. In\r\nlanguage, especially, our people are one; surely much more so than\r\nthose of any other country. The diversity between the people of the\r\ndifferent States, even those most remote from each other, is not as\r\ngreat as that between inhabitants of adjoining countries of England, or\r\ndepartments of France or Spain, where provinces have their separate\r\ndialects. And chief among the causes for this I would place the primary\r\nbook, in which children of my day learned their letters, and took their\r\nfirst lessons in spelling and reading. I refer to the good old spelling\r\nbook of Noah Webster, on which I doubt if there has been any\r\nimprovement, and which had the singular advantage of being used over\r\nthe whole country. To this unity of language and general similitude, is\r\nto be added a community of sentiment wherever the American is brought\r\ninto contrast or opposition to any other people.\r\n\r\nIf shadows float over our disc and threaten an eclipse; if there be\r\nthose who would not avert, but desire to precipitate catastrophe to the\r\nUnion, these are not the sentiments of the American heart; they are\r\nrather the exceptions and should not disturb our confidence in that\r\ndeep-seated sentiment of nationality which aided our fathers when they\r\nentered into the compact of union, and which has preserved it to us.\r\nYou manifest that sentiment to-day in the courtesy which you have\r\nextended to me. In what other land could a countryman go so far from\r\nhis home and receive among strangers the attention which could only be\r\nexpected from friends? But it is not your kindness only, which has\r\ncaused me here to feel at home; I have been brought in contact with men\r\nof my own pursuit, the tillers of the ground and the breeders of stock;\r\nand in my intercourse with this class of your citizens, I have been\r\nfurther confirmed in the high estimate heretofore placed upon that\r\nportion of our population. Happily for our country and its\r\ninstitutions, extensive territory and favorable climate, have attracted\r\na large part of our population to agricultural pursuits. It is in the\r\nindividuality, the sobriety, and self reliance of the rural population\r\nthat I look for the highest development of those qualities essential to\r\nself-government, and the brightest illustration of patriotic devotion.\r\nThey may not be the best informed, but learning and wisdom are by no\r\nmeans equivalent terms. Isolation and entire dependence upon himself;\r\ngive independence of character and favor that self-inquiry which best\r\nenables man to comprehend and measure the motives of his fellow.\r\nCrowded together in cities originality is lost, mind becomes as it were\r\nacadamized; and though the intercourse is favorable to the acquisition\r\nof knowledge, it is most unfriendly to that individuality,\r\nindependence, and purity, without which republican governments rapidly\r\nsink into decay. It was probably in this view that Mr. Jefferson said,\r\ngreat cities were sores upon the body politic. Needful for the purposes\r\nof commerce, required for the exchanges on which agricultural and\r\nmanufacturing industry depend for their prosperity,—they are not evils\r\nwhich we could desire to see abated. My desire, however, is, that the\r\nrural districts shall not lose their relative importance or cease to\r\ncontrol in public affairs. Misled and deceived they may be, interested\r\nin a public wrong they cannot be, and theirs is the sober thought upon\r\nwhich reliance must be placed for the correction of errors and\r\ndelusions, which may temporarily prevail.\r\n\r\nIn societies like this the farmers have the opportunity of comparing\r\nopinions and results, and thus increasing the amount of their\r\nknowledge. The spirit of emulation which is excited must lead to\r\nimprovement, by better directing energy in their pursuit. The\r\npublication of the results and the comparisons thus instituted with\r\nwhat is done in other States, encourages State pride and developes\r\ncommunity feeling. Whatever tends to the cultivation of the idea of\r\nState sovereignty and community independence, strengthens the\r\nfoundation on which rests our federal government—the fruition of that\r\nprinciple which led our fathers into the war of the revolution, where\r\nthey purchased with their blood the rich inheritance transmitted to us.\r\n\r\nMan once received the title of Domitor Equi, he being proud of the\r\nachievement of taming the horse, and then, so far as we can learn,\r\ngentler woman sat like Penelope handling the distaff. Subsequently\r\nthere arose a race of Amazons, who, aspiring to the feats of man, lost\r\nthe gentleness of woman; but in our happy land and day, rising above\r\nthe one without running to the excess of the other, lovely woman, with\r\nall the gentle charms which graced a Penelope, musters her energy when\r\noccasion requires, and displays her prowess in commanding the horse.\r\nAmong the interesting features of the exhibition I shall remember the\r\nequestrianism of the ladies. Though it was beautiful in every sense of\r\nthe word, it was not regarded as mere sport, but the rather looked upon\r\nas part of that mental and physical training which makes a woman more\r\nthan the mere ornament of the drawing-room—fits her usefully to act her\r\nappropriate part in the trying scenes to which the most favored may be\r\nsubjected—to become the mother of heroes, and live in the admiration of\r\nposterity.\r\n\r\nFears had once been entertained and much opposition was formerly made\r\nto an extension of the area of the United States. A wiser policy,\r\nhowever, prevailed, and the introduction of new regions, increasing the\r\nvariety of our productions, have magnified the advantages of free trade\r\nbetween the States, and made us almost independent of other countries\r\nfor the supply of every object whether of necessity or of luxury. I\r\nwould be glad to extend our boundary and make the circle of our\r\nproducts complete, so that, whilst we would encourage commerce with\r\nchristendom we should be, commercially as we are politically,\r\nabsolutely independent, whenever it should be proper or necessary to\r\nterminate intercourse with any or every other country. A statesman of\r\nformer days wished that the Atlantic was a sea of fire, that it might\r\nbe a barrier to shut out European contamination. Whatever fear was once\r\njustifiable, no apprehension now need to exist, that our people will\r\nimitate or seek to adopt the political theories of Europe. We have\r\nrecently rejoiced in the success of the attempt to establish\r\ntelegraphic communication with England; because in closer commercial\r\nties we saw no danger of political influence. I was happy this evening\r\nto receive assurances that the success of that enterprise was at last\r\ncomplete. I have not been of those whose doubts were stronger than\r\ntheir hopes—thanks to a sanguine temperament. I have from the beginning\r\nanticipated success, and have heretofore said that if the present\r\nattempt riled I was sure that Yankee enterprise and skill could make a\r\ncable and lay it across the Atlantic. And we look forward to the result\r\nwith hope, not doubting, that the closest commercial connexion with\r\nother countries can only bring to us benefits. We are not, and have not\r\nbeen, political propagandists, yet believing our form of government the\r\nbest, we properly desire its extension and invite the world to\r\nscrutinize our example of representative liberty.\r\n\r\nThe stars on our flag, recording the number of the States united, have\r\nalready been more than doubled; and I hopefully look forward to the day\r\nwhen the constellation shall become a galaxy covering the stripes,\r\nwhich record the original number of our political family, and shall\r\nshed over the nations of the earth the light of regeneration to\r\nmankind. It has sometimes been said to he our manifest destiny that we\r\nshould possess the whole of this continent. Whether it shall ever all\r\nbe part of the United States is doubtful, and may never be desirable;\r\nbut that in some form or other, it should come under the protectorate\r\nor control of the United States, is a result which seems to me, in the\r\nremote future, certain. It waits as the consequence upon intellectual\r\nvigor, upon physical energy, upon the capacity to govern, and can only\r\nbe defeated by a suicidal madness, of which it does not belong to the\r\noccasion to treat.\r\n\r\nI would not be understood to advocate what is called fillibustering.\r\nOur country has never obtained territory except fairly, honorably and\r\npeaceably. We have conquered territory, but have asserted no title as\r\nthe right of conquest, returning to Mexico all except the part she\r\nagreed to sell and for which we paid a liberal price. England having\r\nfillibustered around the world, has reproached us for aggrandizement,\r\nand we point to history and invite a comparison. There is no stain upon\r\nour escutcheon, no smoke upon our garments, and thus may they remain\r\npure forever! The acquisitions of which I spoke, the protectorate which\r\nwas contemplated, were such as the necessities of the future should\r\ndemand, and the good of others as much as our own require, and this\r\nstep by step, faster or slower, will, I believe, finally embrace the\r\ncontinent of America and its adjacent islands.\r\n\r\nI am not among those who desire to incorporate into our Union,\r\ncountries densely populated with a different race. Deserts, ’tis the\r\nprovince of our people to subdue. A mere handful of inhabitants, such\r\nas existed in Louisiana, are soon enveloped in the tide of immigration;\r\nof this character of acquisition I have no fear; but the mingling of\r\nraces is a different thing. I have looked with interest and pleasure\r\nupon the crosses of your cattle and horses, and saw in it the evidence\r\nof improvement. Let your Messengers, your Morgans, your Drews, and your\r\nEatons be mingled with each other and with new inportations; so with\r\nyour Durhams, Devons, Ayreshires and your Jerseys. The limit to these\r\nexperiments will be where experience shows deterioration. There is one\r\ncross which it is to be hoped you will avoid: ’tis that which your\r\nPuritan fathers would not adopt or even entertain. They kept pure the\r\nCaucasian blood which flowed in their veins, and therein is the cause\r\nof your present high civilization, your progress, your dignity and your\r\nstrength. We are one, let us remain unmixed. In our neighbors of\r\nSouthern and Central America we have a sufficient warning; and may it\r\nnever be our ill-fortune to learn by experience the lessons taught by\r\ntheir example.\r\n\r\nIt is due to the hospitality and kind consideration with which I have\r\nbeen treated since I first came among you that I should not leave you\r\nunder any doubt in relation to the accusations which have been busily\r\ncirculated against me. And this, it is to be hoped, will not be\r\nmistaken for egotism, since the greatest interest I have in doing so is\r\nto justify you to yourselves. I know of no selfish purpose, unless a\r\nproper desire for esteem he such, which would lead me to attempt to\r\nundeceive you, so far as any of you may have been imposed upon. I\r\ncertainly do not expect to change my residence from the State in which\r\nI was reared; and I long since avowed the intention never again to\r\nreceive official trust from any other authority than that of the people\r\nof the State of which I am a citizen. It has been represented to you\r\nthat you were showering attentions upon one who was hostile to your\r\ninterests, and regardless of your rights. I am grateful to you for the\r\nconstant evidence you have given that you discredited the statement,\r\nand I am therefore the more anxious that you should not remain in\r\ndoubt. The public record contains all I have said and done, and in it\r\nnothing can be found to sustain the statement. Of this I am quite sure,\r\nbecause it has always been with me a principle to exercise public\r\nfunctions in the spirit of the Constitution and the purposes of the\r\nUnion. If I know myself, I have never given a vote from a feeling of\r\nhostility to any portion of our common country; but have always kept in\r\nview the common obligation for the common welfare, and desired by\r\nmaintaining the constitution in each and every particular, to\r\nperpetuate the blessings it was designed to secure, and to transmit the\r\ninheritance received from our fathers unmutilated and uncontaminated to\r\nremotest posterity. In some positions it has devolved upon me to study\r\ninterests in Maine, with a view to secure for them proper provision,\r\nand I feel that I am justified in saying they were considered as became\r\none who had sworn to protect the Constitution, and who had a function\r\nto perform in relation to a sovereign State of the Union. Heretofore I\r\nhave been prompted merely by what I believed to be duty to you from me\r\nas an officer under the Constitution. Hereafter, though the principles\r\non which I will act cannot vary, I should be less than a man if I did\r\nnot feel deeper interest in whatever concerns you. I shall always bear\r\nwith me most pleasurable recollections of my sojourn among you, and\r\nhope it may be my good fortune some day to meet some of you in\r\nMississippi, and thus have it in my power to reciprocate, imperfectly\r\nit may be, the kindness which you bestowed upon me. I thank you for\r\nyour polite attention, and cordially wish for you, one and all, present\r\nand future prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeech at the Grand Ratification Meeting, Faneuil Hall,\r\n\r\n_Monday evening, Oct. 11th, 1858._\r\n\r\n\r\nCountrymen, Brethren, Democrats—Most happy am I to meet you, and to\r\nhave received here renewed assurance—of that which I have so long\r\nbelieved—that the pulsation of the democratic heart is the same in\r\nevery parallel of latitude, on every meridian of longitude throughout\r\nthe United States. But it required not this to confirm me in a belief\r\nso long and so happily enjoyed.—Your own great statesman who has\r\nintroduced me to this assembly has been too long associated with me,\r\ntoo nearly connected, we have labored too many hours, sometimes even\r\nuntil one day ran into another, in the cause of our country, for me to\r\nthan to understand that a Massachusetts democrat has a heart\r\ncomprehending the whole of our wide Union, and that its pulsations\r\nalways beat for the liberty and happiness of its country. Neither could\r\nI be unaware such was the sentiment of the democracy of New England.\r\nFor it was lay fortune lately to serve under a President drawn from the\r\nneighboring, State of New Hampshire, [applause,] and I know that he\r\nspoke the language of his heart, for I learned it in tour years of\r\nintimate connection with him, when he said he knew “no north, no south,\r\nno east, no west, but sacred maintenance of the common bond and true\r\ndevotion to the common brotherhood.” Never, sir, in the past history of\r\nour country, never, I add, in its future destiny, however bright it may\r\nbe, did or will a man of higher and purer patriotism, a man more\r\ndevoted to the common weal of his country, hold the helm of our great\r\nship of State, than that same New Englander, Franklin Pierce.\r\n[Applause.]\r\n\r\nI have heard the resolutions read and approved by this meeting; heard\r\nthe address of your candidate for Governor; and these added to the\r\naddress of my old and intimate friend, Gen. Cushing, bear to me fresh\r\ntestimony, which I shall be happy to carry away with me, that the\r\ndemocracy, in the language of your own glorious Webster, “still lives,”\r\nlives not as his great spirit did, when it hung ’twixt life and death,\r\nlike a star upon the horizon’s verge, but lives like the germ that is\r\nshooting upward, like the sapling that is growing to a mighty tree, the\r\nbranches of which will spread over the commonwealth, and may redeem and\r\nrestore Massachusetts to her once glorious place in the Union.\r\n\r\nAs I look around me and see this venerable hall thus thronged, it\r\nreminds me of another meeting, when it was found too small to contain\r\nthe assembly—that great meeting which assembled here, when the people\r\nwere called upon to decide what should be done in relation to the\r\ntea-tax. Faneuil Hall, on that occasion, was found too small, and the\r\npeople went to the Old South Church, which still stands—a monument of\r\nyour early history. And I hope the day will soon come when many\r\nDemocratic meetings in Boston will be too large for Faneuil Hall!\r\n[Applause.] I am welcomed to this hall, so venerable for its\r\nassociations with our early history; to this hall of which you are so\r\njustly proud, and the memories of which are part of the inheritance of\r\nevery American citizen; and feel, as I remember how many voices of\r\npatriotic fervor have here been heard; that in it originated the first\r\nmovements from which the Revolution sprung; that here began that system\r\nof town meetings and free discussion which is the glory and safety of\r\nour country; that I had enough to warn me, that though my theme was\r\nmore humble than theirs, (as befitted my poorer ability,) that it was a\r\nhazardous thing for me to attempt to speak in this sacred temple. But\r\nwhen I heard your statesman (Gen. Cushing) say, that a word once here\r\nspoken never dies, that it becomes a part of the circumambient air, I\r\nfelt a reluctance to speak which increases upon me as I recall his\r\nexpression. But if those voices which breathed the first instincts into\r\nthe Colony of Massachusetts, and into those colonies which formed the\r\nUnited States, to proclaim community independence, and asserts it\r\nagainst the powerful mother country, —if those voices live here still,\r\nhow must they feel who come here to preach treason to the Constitution,\r\nand assail the Union it ordained and established? [Applause.] It would\r\nseem that their criminal hearts should fear that those voices, so long\r\nslumbering, would break their silence, that the forms which look down\r\nfrom these walls behind and around me, would walk forth. and that their\r\nsabres would once more be drawn from their scabbards, to drive from\r\nthis sacred temple fanatical men, who desecrate it more than did the\r\nchangers of money and those who sold doves, the temple of the living\r\nGod. [Loud cheers.]\r\n\r\nAnd here, too, you have, to remind you, and to remind all who enter\r\nthis hall, the portraits of those men who are dear to every lover of\r\nliberty, and part and parcel of the memory of every American citizen.\r\nHighest among them all I see you have placed Samuel Adams and John\r\nHancock. [Applause.] You have placed them the highest and properly; for\r\nthey were the two, the only two, excepted from the proclamation of\r\nmercy, when Governor Gage issued his anathema against them and their\r\nfellow patriots. These men, thus excepted from the saving grace of the\r\ncrown, now occupy the highest place in Faneuil Hall, and thus are\r\nconsecrated highest in the reverence of the people of Boston.\r\n[Applause.] This is one of the instances in which we find tradition\r\nmore reliable than history; for tradition has borne the name of Samuel\r\nAdams to the remotest corner of our territory, placed it among the\r\nhousehold words taught to the rising generation, and there in the new\r\nStates intertwined with our love of representative liberty, it is a\r\nname as sacred among us as it is among you of New England. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nWe remember how early he saw the necessity of _community independence_.\r\nHow, through the dim mists of the future, and in advance of his day, he\r\nlooked forward to the proclamation of that independence by\r\nMassachusetts; how he steadily strove, through good report and evil\r\nreport, with the same unwavering purpose, whether in the midst of his\r\nfellow citizens, cheered by their voices, or whether isolated, a\r\nrefugee, hunted as a criminal, and communing with his own heart, now\r\nunder all circumstances his eve was still fixed upon his first, last\r\nhope, the community independence of Massachusetts! And when we see him,\r\nat a later period, the leader in that correspondence which waked the\r\nfeelings of the other colonies and brought into fraternal association\r\nthe people of Massachusetts with the people of other colonies—when we\r\nsee his letters acknowledging the receipt of the rice of South\r\nCarolina, the flour, the pork, the money of Virginia, Maryland, New\r\nYork, Pennsylvania, and others, contributions of affection to relieve\r\nBoston of the sufferings inflicted upon her when her port was closed by\r\nthe despotism of the British crown—we there see the beginning of that\r\nsentiment which insured the co-operation of the colonies throughout the\r\ndesperate struggle of the Revolution, and which, if the present\r\ngeneration be true to the compact of their sires, to the memory and to\r\nthe principles of the noble men from whom they descended, will\r\nperpetuate for them that spirit of fraternity in which the Union began.\r\n[Applause.]\r\n\r\nBut it is not here alone, nor in reminiscences connected with the\r\nobjects which present themselves within this hall, that the people of\r\nBoston have much to excite their patriotism and carry them back to the\r\ngreat principles of the revolutionary struggle. Where in this vicinity\r\nwill you go and not meet some monument to inspire such sentiments? On\r\none side are Lexington and Concord, where sixty brave countrymen came\r\nwith their fowling pieces to oppose six hundred veterans,—where\r\npeaceful citizens animated by the love of independence and covered by\r\nthe triple shield of a righteous cause, finally forced those veterans\r\nback, and pursued them on the road, fighting from every barn and bush,\r\nand stock, and stone, till they drove them to the shelters from which\r\nthey had gone forth! [Applause.] And there on another side of your city\r\nstand those monuments of your early patriotism, Breed’s and Bunker’s\r\nHill whose soil drank the sacred blood of men who lived for their\r\ncountry and died for mankind! Can it be that any of you tread that soil\r\nand forget the great purposes for which those men bravely fought, or\r\nnobly died?” [Applause.] While in yet another direction rise the\r\nHeights of Dorchester, once the encampment of the great Virginian, the\r\nman who came here in the cause of American independence, who did not\r\nask “Is this a town of Virginia?” but, “Is this a town of my brethren?”\r\nwho pitched his camp and commenced his operations with the steady\r\ncourage and cautious wisdom characteristic of Washington, hopefully,\r\nresolutely waiting and watching for the day when he could drive the\r\nBritish troops out of your city. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nHere, too, you find where once the Old Liberty Tree, connected with so\r\nmany of your memories, grew. You ask your legend, and learn that it was\r\ncut down for firewood by the British soldiers, as some of your meeting\r\nhouses were pulled down. They burned the old tree, and it warmed the\r\nsoldiers enough to enable them to evacuate the city. [Laughter.] Had\r\nthey been more slowly warmed into motion, had it burned a little\r\nlonger, it might have lighted Washington and his followers to their\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nBut they were gone, and never again may a hostile foe tread your shore.\r\nWoe to the enemy who shall set his footprint upon your soil; he comes\r\nto a prison or he comes to a grave! [Applause.] American fortifications\r\nare not intended to protect our country from invasion. They are\r\nconstructed elsewhere as in your harbor to guard points where marine\r\nattacks can he made; and for the rest, the breasts of Americans are our\r\nparapets. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nBut, my friends, it is not merely in these military associations, so\r\nhonorably connected with the pride of Massachusetts, that one who\r\nvisits Boston finds much for gratification. If I were selecting a place\r\nwhere the advocate of strict construction of the Constitution, the\r\nextreme asserter of democratic state rights doctrine should go for his\r\ntext, I would send him into the collections of your historical\r\nassociation. Instead of finding Boston a place where the records would\r\nteach only federalism, he would find here, in bounteous store, that\r\nsacred doctrine of state rights, which has been called the extreme and\r\nultra opinion of the South. He would find among your early records that\r\nat the time when Massachusetts was under a colonial government,\r\nadministered by a man appointed by the British crown, guarded by\r\nBritish soldiers; the use of this old Faneuil Hall was refused by the\r\ntown authorities to a British Governor, to hold a British festival,\r\nbecause he was going to bring with him the agents for collecting, and\r\nnaval officers sent here to enforce, an unconstitutional tax upon your\r\ncommonwealth. Such was the proud spirit of independence manifested even\r\nin your colonial history. Such the great stone your fathers hewed with\r\nsturdy hand, and left the fit foundation for a monument to state\r\nrights! [Applause.] And so throughout the early period of our country\r\nyou find Massachusetts leading, most prominent of all the States, in\r\nthe assertion of that doctrine which has been recently so much decried.\r\n\r\nHaving achieved your independence, having passed through the\r\nconfederation, you assented to the formation of our present\r\nconstitutional Union. You did not surrender your state sovereignty.\r\nYour fathers had sacrificed too much to claim as the reward of their\r\ntrials that they should merely have a change of masters. And a change\r\nof masters it would have been had Massachusetts surrendered her State\r\nsovereignty to the central government, and consented that that central\r\ngovernment should have the power to coerce a State. But if this power\r\ndoes not exist, if this sovereignty has not been surrendered, then, I\r\nsay, who can deny the words of soberness and truth spoken by your\r\ncandidate this evening, when he has plead to you the cause of State\r\nindependence, and the right of every community to he the judge of its\r\nown domestic affairs? [Applause.] This is all we have ever asked—we of\r\nthe South, I mean,—for I stand before you one of those who have been\r\ncalled the ultra men of the South, and I speak, therefore, for that\r\nclass; and tell you that your candidate for Governor has asserted\r\nto-night everything which we have claimed as a right, and demanded as a\r\nduty resulting from the guarantees of the Constitution, made for our\r\nmutual protection. [Applause.] Nor is here alone in that such doctrine\r\nis asserted, the like it has been my happiness to hear in your\r\ndaughter, the neighboring State of Maine. I have found that the\r\ndemocrats there asserted the same broad, constitutional principle for\r\nwhich we have been contending, by which we are willing to live, for\r\nwhich we are willing to die! [Loud cheers and cries of “good!”]\r\n\r\nIn this state of the case, my friends, why is the country agitated?\r\nWhat is there practical or rational in the present excitement? Why,\r\nsince the old controversies, with all their lights and shadows, have\r\npassed away, is the political firmament covered by one dark pall, the\r\nfuneral shade of which increases with every passing year?\r\n\r\nWhy is it, I say, that you are thus agitated in relation to the\r\ndomestic affairs of other communities? Why is it that the peace of the\r\ncountry is disturbed in order that one people may assume to judge of\r\nwhat another people should do? Is there any political power to\r\nauthorize such interference? If so, where is it? You did not surrender\r\nyour sovereignty. You gave to the federal government certain functions.\r\nIt was your agent, created for specified purposes. It can do nothing\r\nsave that which you have given it power to perform. Where is the grant\r\nof the Constitution which confers on the federal government a right to\r\ndetermine what shall be property? Surely none such exists; that\r\nquestion it belongs to every community to settle for itself: you judge\r\nin your case; every other State must judge in its case. The federal\r\ngovernment has no power to create or establish; more palpably still, it\r\nhas no power to destroy property. Do you pay taxes to an agent that he\r\nmay destroy your property? Do you support him for that purpose? It is\r\nan absurdity on the face of it. To ask the question is to answer it.\r\nThe government is instituted to protect, not to destroy property. In\r\nabundance of caution, your fathers provided that the federal government\r\nshould not take private property, even for its own use, unless by\r\nmaking due compensation therefore. One of its great purposes was to\r\nincrease the security of property, and by a more perfect union of\r\nforces, to render more effective protection to the States. When that\r\npower for protection becomes a source of danger, the purpose for which\r\nthe government was formed will have been defeated, and the government\r\ncan no longer answer the ends for which it was established.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, in the absence of all control over the subject of African\r\nslavery, are you agitated in relation to it? With Pharisaical\r\npretension it is sometimes said it is a moral obligation to agitate,\r\nand I suppose they are going through a sort of vicarious repentance for\r\nother men’s sins. [Laughter.] Who gave them a right to decide that it\r\nis a sin? By what standard do they measure it? Not the Constitution;\r\nthe Constitution recognizes the property in many forms, and imposes\r\nobligations in connection with that recognition. Not the Bible; that\r\njustifies it. Not the good of society; for if they go where it exists,\r\nthey find that society recognizes it as good. What, then, is their\r\nstandard? The good of mankind? Is that seen in the diminished resources\r\nof the country? Is that seen in the diminished comfort of the world? Or\r\nis not the reverse exhibited? Is it in the cause of Christianity? It\r\ncannot be, for servitude is the only agency through which Christianity\r\nhas reached that degraded race, the only means by which they have been\r\ncivilized and elevated. Or is their charity manifested in denunciation\r\nof their brethren who are restrained from answering by the contempt\r\nwhich they feel for a mere brawler, whose weapons are empty words?\r\n[Applause.]\r\n\r\nWhat, my friends, must be the consequences of this agitation? Good or\r\nevil? They have been evil, and evil they must be only, to the end. Not\r\none particle of good has been done to any man, of any color, by this\r\nagitation. It has been insidiously working the purpose of sedition, for\r\nthe destruction of that Union on which our hopes of future greatness\r\ndepend.\r\n\r\nOn the one side, then you see agitation, tending slowly and steadily to\r\nthat separation of the states, which, if you have any hope connected\r\nwith the liberty of mankind, if you have any national pride in making\r\nyour country the greatest of the earth, if you have any sacred regard\r\nfor the obligation which the acts of your fathers entailed upon you,—by\r\neach and all of these motives you are prompted to united and earnest\r\neffort to promote the success of that great experiment which your\r\nfathers left it to you to conclude. [Applause.] On the other hand, if\r\neach community, in accordance with the principles of our government,\r\nwhilst controlling its own domestic institutions, faithfully struggles\r\nas a part of the united whole, for the common benefit of all, the\r\nfuture points us to fraternity, to unity, to co-operation, to the\r\nincrease of our own happiness, to the extension of our useful example\r\nover mankind, and the covering of that flag, whose stars have already\r\nmore than doubled their original number, [applause,] with a galaxy to\r\nlight the ample folds which then shall wave either the recognized flag\r\nof every state, or the recognized protector of every state upon the\r\ncontinent of America. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nIn connection with the idea, which I have presented of the early\r\nsentiment of community independence, I will add the very striking fact\r\nthat one of the colonies, about the time that they had resolved to\r\nunite for the purpose of achieving their independence, addressed the\r\ncolonial congress to know in what condition they would be in the\r\ninterval between their separation from the government of Great Britain\r\nand the establishment of the government for the colonies. The answer of\r\nthe colonial congress was exactly that which might have been\r\nexpected—exactly that which state rights democracy would answer to-day,\r\nto such an inquiry—that they must take care of their domestic polity,\r\nthat the congress “had nothing to do with it.” [Applause.] If such\r\nsentiment continued—if it governed in every state—if representatives\r\nwere chosen upon it—then your halls of legislation would not be\r\ndisturbed about the question of the domestic concerns of the different\r\nstates. The peace of the country would not be hazarded by the\r\narraignment of the family relations of people over whom the government\r\nhas no control. In harmony working together, in co-intelligence for the\r\nconservation of the interests of the country, in protection to the\r\nstates and the development of the great ends for which the government\r\nwas established, what effects might not be produced? As our government\r\nincreased in expansion, it would increase in its beneficent influence\r\nupon the people; we should increase in fraternity; and it would be no\r\nlonger a wonder to see a man coming from a southern state to address a\r\nDemocratic audience in Boston. [Applause, cries of “good, good.”]\r\n\r\nBut I have referred to the fact that, at an early period, Massachusetts\r\nstood pre-eminently forward among those who asserted community\r\nindependence. And this reminds me of an incident, in illustration,\r\nwhich occurred when President Washington visited Boston, and John\r\nHancock was Governor. The latter is reported to have declined to call\r\nupon the President, because he contended that every man who came within\r\nthe limits of Massachusetts must yield rank and precedence to the\r\nGovernor of the State; and only surrendered the point on account of his\r\npersonal regard and respect for the character of George Washington. I\r\nhonor him for it,—value it as one of the early testimonies in favor of\r\nState Rights, and wish all our governors had the same high estimate of\r\nthe dignity of the office of Governor of a State as had that great and\r\nglorious man. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nThus it appears that the founders of this government were the true\r\nDemocratic States Rights men. That Democracy was States rights, and\r\nStates rights was Democracy, and it is to-day. Your resolutions breathe\r\nit. The Declaration of Independence embodies the sentiment which had\r\nlived in the hearts of the people for many years before its formal\r\nassertion. Our fathers asserted that great principle—the right of the\r\npeople to choose the government for themselves—that government rested\r\nupon the consent of the governed. In every form of expression it\r\nuttered the same idea, _community independence_, and the dependence of\r\nthe government upon the community over which it existed. It was an\r\nAmerican principle, the great spirit which animated our country then,\r\nand it were well if more inspired us now. But I have said that this\r\nState sovereignty—this community independence—has never been\r\nsurrendered, and that there is no power in the federal government to\r\ncoerce a State. Does any one ask, then, how it is that a State is to be\r\nheld to its obligations? My answer is: by _its honor_, and the\r\nobligation is the more sacred to observe every feature of the compact,\r\nbecause there is no power to force obedience. The great error of the\r\nconfederation was that it attempted to act upon the States. It was\r\nfound impracticable, and our present form of government was adopted,\r\nwhich acts upon individuals and does not attempt to act upon States.\r\n\r\nThe question was considered in the convention which framed the\r\nconstitution, and after discussion the proposition to give power to the\r\ngeneral government to enforce upon a resistant State obedience to the\r\nlaw was rejected. It was upon this ground of exemption from compulsion\r\nthat the compact of the States became a sacred obligation; and it was\r\nupon this honorable fulfilment principally that our fathers depended\r\nfor the security of the rights which the Constitution was designed to\r\nsecure. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nThe fugitive slave compact in the Constitution of the United States\r\nimplied that the States should fulfil it voluntarily. They expected the\r\nStates to legislate so as to secure the rendition of fugitives.\r\n\r\nAnd in 1788 it was a matter of complaint that the colony of Florida did\r\nnot restore fugitive negroes from the United States who escaped into\r\nthat colony, and a committee, composed of Hamilton, of New York,\r\nSedgwick, of Massachusetts, and Madison, of Virginia, reported\r\nresolutions in the Congress instructing the committee for foreign\r\naffairs to address the _charge d’affaires_ at Madrid to apply to his\r\nmajesty of Spain to issue orders to his governor to compel them to\r\nsecure the rendition of fugitive negroes to any one who should go there\r\nentitled to receive them. This was the sentiment of the committee, and\r\nthey added, by way of example, as the States would return any slaves\r\nfrom Florida who might escape into their limits.\r\n\r\nWhen the Constitutional requirement was imposed, who could have doubted\r\nthat every State faithful to its obligations would comply without\r\nraising questions as to whether the institution should or should not\r\nexist in another community over which they had no control. Congress was\r\nat last forced by the failures of the States, to legislate on the\r\nsubject, and this has been one of the causes by which you have been\r\ndisturbed. You have been called upon to make war against a law which\r\nwould never have been enacted, if each State had faithfully discharged\r\nthe obligation imposed by the compact of the Constitution. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nThere is another question connected with this negro agitation. It is in\r\nrelation to the right to hold slaves in the Territories. What power has\r\nCongress to declare what shall be property? None, in the territory or\r\nelsewhere. Have the States by separate legislation the power to\r\nprescribe the condition upon which a citizen may enter on and enjoy the\r\ncommon property of the United States? Clearly not. Shall those who\r\nfirst go into the territory, deprive any citizen of the United States\r\nsubsequently emigrating thither, of those rights which belong to him as\r\nan equal owner of the soil? Certainly not. Sovereignty jurisdiction can\r\nonly pass to these inhabitants when the States, the owners of that\r\nterritory, shall recognize the inhabitants as an independent community,\r\nand admit it to become an equal State of the Union. Until then the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States must be the rules governing\r\nwithin the limits of a territory. The Constitution recognizes all\r\nproperty gives equal privileges to every citizen of the States; and it\r\nwould be a violation of its fundamental principles to attempt any\r\ndiscrimination. [Applause.] Viewed in any of its phases, political,\r\nmoral, social, general, or local, what is there to sustain this\r\nagitation in relation to other people’s negroes, unless it be a bridge\r\nover which to pass into office—a ready capital in politics available to\r\nmissionaries staving at home-reformers of things which they do not go\r\nto learn—preachers without and audience—overseers without laborers and\r\nwithout wages—war-horses who snuff the battle afar off, and cry: “ Aha!\r\naha! I am afar off from the battle.” [Great laughter and applause.]\r\n\r\nThus it is that the peace of the Union is destroyed; thus it is that\r\nbrother is arrayed against brother; thus it is that the people come to\r\nconsider—not how they can promote each other’s interests, but how they\r\nmay successfully war upon them. And the political agitator like the\r\nvampire fans the victim to which he clings but to destroy.\r\n\r\nAmong culprits there is none more odious to my mind than a public\r\nofficer who takes an oath to support the Constitution—the compact\r\nbetween the States binding each for the common defence and general\r\nwelfare of the other—yet retains to himself a mental reservation that\r\nhe will war upon the principles he has sworn to maintain, and upon the\r\nproperty rights the protection of which are part of the compact of the\r\nUnion. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nIt is a crime too low to be named before this assembly: It is one which\r\nno man with self-respect would ever commit. To swear that he will\r\nsupport the Constitution—to take an office which belongs in many of its\r\nrelations to all the States; and to use it as a means of injuring a\r\nportion of the States of whom he is thus the representative; is treason\r\nto every thing honorable in man. It is the base and cowardly attack of\r\nhim who gains the confidence of another, in order that he may wound\r\nhim. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nBut we have heard it argued—have seen it published—a petition has been\r\ncirculated for signers, announcing that there was an incompatibility\r\nbetween the sections; that the Union had been tried long enough, and\r\nthat it had proved to be necessary to separate from those sections of\r\nthe Union in which the curse of slavery existed. Ah! those modern\r\nsaints, so much wiser than our fathers, have discovered an\r\nincompatibility requiring separation in those relations which existed\r\nwhen the Union was formed. They have found the remnants only of a\r\ndiversity which existed when South Carolina sent her rice to Boston,\r\nand Maryland and Pennsylvania and New York brought in their funds for\r\nher relief.\r\n\r\nThey have found the remnants only; for from that day to this the\r\ndifference between the people has been constantly decreasing, and the\r\nnecessity for union which then arose in no small degree from the\r\ndiversity of product, and soil and climate, has gone on increasing,\r\nboth by the extension of our own territory and the introduction of new\r\ntropical products; so that whilst the difference between the people has\r\ndiminished, the diversity in the products has increased, and that\r\nmotive for union which your fathers found exists in a higher degree\r\nthan it did when they resolved to be united.\r\n\r\nDiversity there is of occupation, of habits, of education, of\r\ncharacter. But it is not of that extreme kind which proves\r\nincompatibility, or even incongruity; for your Massachusetts man, when\r\nhe comes to Mississippi, adopts our opinions and our institutions, and\r\nfrequently becomes the most extreme southern man among us. [Great\r\napplause.] As our country has extended—as new products have been\r\nintroduced into it, the free trade which blesses our Union, has been of\r\nincreasing value.\r\n\r\nAnd it is not an unfortunate circumstance that this diversity of\r\npursuit and character has survived the condition which produced it.\r\nOriginally it sprang in no small degree from natural causes.\r\nMassachusetts became a manufacturing and a commercial State because of\r\nthe connection between her fine harbor and water power, resulting from\r\nthe fact that the streams make their last leap into the sea, so that\r\nthe ship of commerce brought the staple to the manufacturing power.\r\nThis made you a commercial and manufacturing people. In the Southern\r\nStates great plains interpose between the last leaps of the streams and\r\nthe sea. Those plains most proximate to navigation, were the first\r\ncultivated, and the sea bore their products to the most approachable\r\nwater power, there to be manufactured. This was the first cause of the\r\ndifference. Then your longer and more severe winters—your soil not as\r\nfavorable for agriculture, also contributed to make you a manufacturing\r\nand commercial people.\r\n\r\nAfter the controlling cause had passed away—after railroads had been\r\nbuilt—after the steam engine had become a motive power for a large part\r\nof machinery, the characteristics originally stamped by natural causes\r\ncontinued the diversity of pursuit. Is it fortunate or otherwise? I say\r\nit is fortunate. Your interest is to remain a manufacturing and ours to\r\nremain an agricultural people.\r\n\r\nYour prosperity is to receive our staple and to manufacture it, and\r\nours to sell it to you and buy the manufactured goods. [Applause.] This\r\nis an interweaving of interests, which makes us all the richer and all\r\nthe happier.\r\n\r\nBut this accursed agitation, this offensive, injurious intermeddling\r\nwith the affairs of other people, and this alone it is that will\r\npromote a desire in the mind of any one to separate these great and\r\ngrowing States. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nThe seeds of dissension may be sown by invidious reflections. Men may\r\nbe goaded by the constant attempt to infringe upon rights and to\r\ntraduce community character, and in the resentment which follows it is\r\nnot possible to tell how far the case may be driven. I therefore plead\r\nto you now to arrest a fanaticism which has been evil in the beginning,\r\nand must be evil to the end. You may not have the numerical power\r\nrequisite; and those at a distance may not understand how many of you\r\nthere are desirous to put a stop to the course of this agitation. But\r\nlet your language and your acts teach them to appreciate a faithful\r\nself-denying minority. I have learned since I have been in New England\r\nthe vast mass of true State Rights Democrats to be found within its\r\nlimits—though not represented in the halls of Congress.\r\n\r\nAnd if it comes to the worst; if, availing themselves of a majority in\r\nthe two Houses of Congress, our opponents should attempt to trample\r\nupon the Constitution; to violate the rights of the States; to infringe\r\nupon our equality in the Union, I believe that even in Massachusetts,\r\nthough it has not had a representative in Congress for many a day, the\r\nState Rights Democracy, in whose breasts beats the spirit of the\r\nrevolution, can and will whip the Black Republicans. [Great applause.]\r\nI trust we shall never be thus purified, as it were, by fire; but that\r\nthe peaceful progressive revolution of the ballot box will answer all\r\nthe glorious purposes of the Constitutional Union. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nI marked that the distinguished orator and statesman who preceded me in\r\naddressing you used the words _national_ and _constitutional_ in such\r\nrelations to each other as to show that in his mind the one was a\r\nsynonym of the other. And does he not do so with reason? We became a\r\nnation by the constitution; whatever is national springs from the\r\nconstitution; and national and constitutional are convertible terms.\r\n[Applause.]\r\n\r\nYour candidate for the high office of governor—whom I have been once or\r\ntwice on the point of calling your governor, and whom I hope I may be\r\nable soon to call so, [applause]—in his remarks to you has presented\r\nthe same idea in another form. And well may Massachusetts orators,\r\nwithout even perceiving what they are saying, utter sentiments which\r\nlie at the foundation of your colonial as well as your revolutionary\r\nhistory, which existed in Massachusetts before the revolution, and have\r\nexisted since, whenever the true spirit which comes down from the\r\nrevolutionary sires has been aroused into utterance within her limits.\r\n[Applause.]\r\n\r\nIt has been not only, my friends, in this increasing and mutual\r\ndependence of interest that we have formed new bonds. Those bonds are\r\nboth material and mental. Every improvement in the navigation of a\r\nriver, every construction of a railroad, has added another link to the\r\nchain which encircles us, another facility for interchange and new\r\nachievements, whether it has been in arts or in science, in war or in\r\nmanufactures, in commerce or agriculture, success, unexampled success\r\nhas constituted for us a common and proud memory, and has offered to us\r\nnew sentiments of nationality.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, I would ask, do we see these lengthened shadows, which\r\nfollow in the course of our political day? is it because the sun is\r\ndeclining to the horizon? Are they the shadows of evening; or are they,\r\nas I hopefully believe, but the mists which are exhaled by the sun as\r\nit rises, but which are to be dispersed by its meridian splendor? Are\r\nthey but evanescent clouds that flit across but cannot obscure the\r\ngreat purposes for which the Constitution was established?\r\n\r\nI hopefully look forward to the reaction which will establish the fact\r\nthat our sun is yet in the ascendant—that the cloud which has covered\r\nour political prospect is but a mist of the morning—that we are again\r\nto be amicably divided in opinion upon measures of expediency, upon\r\nquestions of relative interest, upon discussions as to the rights of\r\nthe States, and the powers of the federal government,—such discussion\r\nas is commemorated in this historical picture [pointing to the\r\npainting.] There your own great Statesman, Webster, addresses his\r\nargument to our brightest luminary, the incorruptible Calhoun, who\r\nleans over to catch the accents of eloquence that fall from his lips.\r\n[Loud applause.]\r\n\r\nThey differed as Statesmen and philosophers; they railed not, warred\r\nnot against each other; they stood to each other in the relation of\r\naffection and regard. And never did I see Mr. Webster so agitated,\r\nnever did I hear his voice so falter, as when he delivered his eulogy\r\non John C. Calhoun. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nBut allusion was made to my own connection with your favorite departed\r\nStatesman. I will only say on this occasion, that very early in the\r\ncommencement of my congressional life, Mr. Webster was arraigned for an\r\noffence which affected him most deeply. He was no accountant; all knew\r\nthat there was but little of mercantile exactness in his habits. He was\r\narraigned on a pecuniary charge—the misapplication of what is known as\r\nthe secret service fund; and I was one of the committee that had to\r\ninvestigate the charge. I endeavored to do justice, to examine the\r\nevidence with a view to ascertain the truth. As an American I hoped he\r\nwould come out without stain or smoke upon his garments. But however\r\nthe fame of so distinguished an American Statesman might claim such\r\nhopes, the duty was rigidly to inquire, and rigorously to do justice.\r\nThe result was that he was acquitted of every charge that was made\r\nagainst him, and it was equally my pride and my pleasure to vindicate\r\nhim in every form which lay within my power. [Applause.] No man who\r\nknew Daniel Webster, would have expected less of him. Had our position\r\nbeen reversed, none such could have believed that he would with a view\r\nto a judgment ask whether a charge was made against a Massachusetts man\r\nor a Mississippian. No! it belonged to a lower, a later, and I trust a\r\nshorter lived race of statesmen [“hear,” “hear,”] to measure all facts\r\nby considerations of latitude and longitude. [Warm applause.]\r\n\r\nI honor that sentiment which makes us oftentimes too confident, and to\r\ndespise too much the danger of that agitation which disturbs the peace\r\nof the country. I honor that feeling which believes the Constitutional\r\nUnion too strong to be shaken. But at the same time I say, in sober\r\njudgment, it will not do to treat too lightly the danger which has\r\nbeset and which still impends over us. Who has not heard our\r\nConstitutional Union compared to the granite cliffs which line the sea\r\nand dash back the foam of the waves, unmoved by their fury. Recently I\r\nhave stood upon New England’s shore, and have seen the waves of a\r\ntroubled sea dash upon the granite which frowns over the ocean, have\r\nseen the spray thrown back from the cliff, and the receding wave fret\r\nlike the impotent rage of baffled malice. But when the tide had ebbed,\r\nI saw that the rock was seamed and worn by the ceaseless beating of the\r\nsea, and fragments riven from the rock were lying on the beach.\r\n\r\nThus the waves of sectional agitation are dashing themselves against\r\nthe granite patriotism of the land. If long continued, that too must\r\nshow the seams and scars of the conflict. Sectional hostility must\r\nsooner or later produce political fragments. The danger lies at your\r\ndoor, it is time to arrest it. It is time that men should go back to\r\nthe origin of our institutions. They should drink the waters of the\r\nfountain, ascend to the source, of our colonial history.\r\n\r\nYou, men of Boston, go to the street where the massacre occurred in\r\n1770. There learn how your fathers unfaltering stood for community\r\nright. And near the same spot mark how proudly the delegation of the\r\ndemocracy came to demand the removal of the troops from Boston, and how\r\nthe venerable Samuel Adams stood asserting the rights of the people,\r\ndauntless as Hampden, clear and eloquent as Sidney.\r\n\r\nAll over our country these monuments, instructive to the present\r\ngeneration, of what our fathers felt and said and did, are to be found.\r\nIn the library of your association for the collection of your early\r\nhistory, I found a letter descriptive of the reading of the address to\r\nhis army by Gen. Washington during one of those winters when he sought\r\nshelter for the ill clad, unshod, but victorious army with which he\r\nachieved the independence we enjoy; he had built a log cabin for a\r\nmeeting house, and there reading his address, his sight failed him, he\r\nput on his glasses and with emotion which manifested the reality of his\r\nfeelings, said, “I have grown gray in the service of my country, and\r\nnow I am growing blind.” Who can measure the value of such incidents in\r\na people’s history? It is a privilege to have access to documents,\r\nwhich cause us to realize the trials, the patient endurance, the hardy\r\nvirtue and moral grandeur of the men from whom we inherit our political\r\ninstitutions, and to whose teachings it were well that the present\r\ngenerations should constantly refer.\r\n\r\nIf you choose still further to stretch your vision to South Carolina,\r\nyou will find a parallel to that devotion to their country’s cause\r\nwhich illustrates the early history of the Democrats of Boston. The\r\nprisoners at Charleston, when confined upon the hulks where they were\r\nexposed to the small pox, and, wasted by the progress of the infection,\r\nwere brought upon the shore and assured that if they would enlist in\r\nhis majesty’s service they should be relieved from their present and\r\nprospective suffering, but if they refused the rations would be taken\r\nfrom their families, and themselves sent to the hulks and exposed to\r\nthe infection. Emaciated as they were, distressed with the prospect of\r\ntheir families being turned into the street to starve, the spirit of\r\nindependence, the devotion to liberty, was so warm within their breasts\r\nthat they gave one loud hurrah for General Washington, and chose death\r\nrather than dishonor. [Loud applause.] And if from these glorious\r\nrecollections, from the emotions they excite, your eye is directed to\r\nyour present condition, and you mark the prosperity, the growth and\r\nhonorable career of your country, I envy not the heart of that man\r\nwhose pulse does not beat quicker, who does not feel within him the\r\nexultation of pride at the past glory and the future prospects of his\r\ncountry. These prospects are to be realized if we are only wise and\r\ntrue to the obligations of the compact of our fathers. For all which\r\ncan sow dissension can stop the progress of the American people, can\r\nendanger the achievement of the high prospects we have before us is\r\nthat miserable spirit, which, disregarding duty and honor, makes war\r\nupon the Constitution. Madness must rule the hour when American\r\ncitizens, trampling as well upon the great principles at the foundation\r\nof the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, as upon the honorable obligations which their fathers imposed\r\nupon them, shall turn with internicine hand to sacrifice themselves as\r\nwell as their brethren, upon the altar of sectional fanaticism.\r\n\r\nWith these views, it will not be surprising to those who differ from\r\nme, that I feel an ardent desire for the success of the State Rights\r\nDemocracy, that convinced of the destructive consequences of the\r\nheresies of their opponents, and of the evils upon which they would\r\nprecipitate the country, I do not forbear to advocate, here and\r\nelsewhere, the success of that party which alone is national, on which\r\nalone I rely for the preservation of the Constitution, to perpetuate\r\nthe Union, and to fulfil the purposes which it was ordained to\r\nestablish and secure. [Loud cheers.]\r\n\r\nMy friends, my brethren, my countrymen—[applause]—I thank you for the\r\npatient attention you have given me. It is the first time it has been\r\nmy fortune to address an audience here. It will probably be the last.\r\nResiding in a remote section of the country, with private as well as\r\npublic duties to occupy the whole of my time, it would only be under\r\nsome such necessity for a restoration of health as has brought me here\r\nthis season, that I could ever expect to make more than a very hurried\r\nvisit to any other portion of the Union than that of which I am a\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\nI will say, then, on this occasion, that I am glad, truly glad, that it\r\nhas been my fortune to stay long enough among the New Englanders to\r\nobtain a better acquaintance than one can who passes in the ordinary\r\nway through the country, at the speed of the railroad tourist. I have\r\nstayed long enough to feel that generous hospitality which evinces\r\nitself to-night, which has showed itself in every town and village of\r\nNew England where I have gone—long enough to learn that though not\r\nrepresented in Congress, there is within the limits of New England a\r\nlarge mass of as true Democrats as are to be found in any portion of\r\nthe Union. Their purposes, their construction of the Constitution,\r\ntheir hopes for the future, their respect for the past, is the same as\r\nthat which exists among my beloved brethren in Mississippi. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nIt is not a great while since one who was endeavoring to pursue me with\r\nunfriendly criticism opened an article with my name and “gone to\r\nBoston!”—He seemed to think it a damaging reflection to say of me that\r\nI had gone to Boston—I wish he could have been here to look upon these\r\nDemocratic faces to-night, and to listen to your resolutions and the\r\nwords of your Massachusetts speakers, he might have been taught that a\r\nman might go and stay at Boston and learn better Democracy than many\r\nhave acquired in other places.\r\n\r\nI shall gratefully carry with me the recollections of this and of other\r\nmeetings witnessed since I have been among you. In the hour of\r\napprehension I will hopefully turn back to my observations here—here in\r\nthis consecrated hall, where men so early devoted themselves to liberty\r\nand community independence; and will endeavor to impress upon others\r\nwho know you only as you are misrepresented in the two Houses of\r\nCongress, [applause,] how true and how many are the hearts that beat\r\nfor constitutional liberty, and with high resolve to respect every\r\nclause and guaranty which the Constitution contains, are pledged to\r\nfaithfully uphold the rights of any and every portion of the States,\r\nand of the people. [Tremendous cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeech in the City of New York,\r\n\r\n_Palace Garden Meeting, Oct. 19, 1858._\r\n\r\n\r\nCountrymen, Democrats:—When I accepted this evening the invitation to\r\nmeet you here, it was to see and to hear, not to speak. I have listened\r\nwith pleasure to the language addressed to you by your candidate for\r\nthe highest office in the State. It is the language of patriotism; it\r\nis an appeal to the common sense of the people in favor of that\r\nfraternity on which our Union was founded, and on which alone it can\r\nlong continue to exist. I have rejoiced to hear the applause with which\r\nsuch sentiments, when he uttered them, have been received by those here\r\nconvened, and trust it is but an indication of that onward progress of\r\nreaction which I believe has already commenced, and which is to sink to\r\nthe lowest depths of forgetfulness the struggle which has so long\r\nagitated the country, and prompted an internecine war against your\r\ncountrymen. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nTruly has the distinguished gentleman pointed out to you the extreme\r\nabsurdity of attempting to excite you upon the ground of southern\r\naggression upon the north. We have nothing to aggress upon. We have not\r\nnow, as he has told you, the power, though once we had, to interfere\r\nwith your domestic institutions. We never had the will to do so. And if\r\nwe had the power now, true to the instincts and history of our fathers,\r\nwe would abstain from intermeddling in your domestic affairs.\r\n[Applause.] I have no purpose on this or any other occasion to mingle\r\nin the consideration of those questions which are local to you. I am\r\nnot sufficiently learned in conchology to do it if I would, [laughter,]\r\nand I have too great a respect for community independence to do it if I\r\ncould. My purpose then is, simply in answer to your call, to offer you\r\na few reflections, such as may occur to me, as I progress, upon those\r\nquestions which are common to us all, and which belong to the memories\r\nof our fathers, and are linked with the hopes of our children.\r\n[Applause.] If; then, without preparation, I do it in unvarnished\r\nphrase, if I cannot carry you along with me because of the want of that\r\nflowing diction which might catch the ear, still I ask you to hear me\r\nfor my cause, for it is the cause of our country, it is the cause of\r\ndemocracy, it is the cause of human liberty. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nWho now stand arrayed against the democratic party? The relations of\r\nparties and the issues upon which we have been divided have changed.\r\nWhat now is the basis of opposition to the democratic party? It is\r\ntwofold—interference with the negroes of other people, and interference\r\nwith the rights now secured to foreigners who expatriate themselves and\r\ncome to our land. [“Hear, hear,” and applause.] To each community\r\nbelongs the right to decide for itself what institutions it will have.\r\nTo each people sovereign within their own sphere, belongs, and to them\r\nonly belongs, the right to decide what shall be property. You have\r\ndecided it for yourselves. Who shall gainsay your decision? Mississippi\r\nhas decided it for herself; who has the right to gainsay her decision?\r\nThe power of each people to rule over their domestic affairs lies at\r\nthe foundation of that Declaration of Independence to which you owe\r\nyour existence among the nations of the earth; that declaration which\r\nled your fathers into and through the war of the revolution. _It is\r\nthat which constitutes to-day the doctrine of State-rights, upon which\r\nit is my pride and pleasure to stand._ [Applause.] Congress has no\r\npower to determine what shall be property anywhere. Congress has only\r\nsuch grants as are contained in the Constitution. And the Constitution\r\nconfers upon it no power to rule with despotic hand over the\r\ninhabitants of the Territories. Within the limits of those Territories,\r\nthe common property of the Union, you and I are equal; we are joint\r\nowners. Each of us has the right to go into those Territories, with\r\nwhatever property is recognized by the Constitution of the United\r\nStates. [Applause.] Congress has no power to limit or abridge that\r\nright. But the inhabitants of a Territory when as a people they come to\r\nform a State government, _when they possess the power and jurisdiction\r\nwhich belongs to the people of New York, or any other State, have the\r\nright to decide that question, and no power upon earth has the right to\r\ndecide it before that time._ [Applause.]\r\n\r\n[At this point the Young Men’s Democratic National Club, with banners\r\nand transparencies, entered the garden, and were received with\r\nenthusiastic cheers.]\r\n\r\nThe dull remarks, my friends, which I was in the course of making to\r\nyou, have been interrupted by a beautiful episode, which I am sure will\r\nmore than exceed the whole value of the poem, if I may thus\r\ncharacterize my dull speech. And I am glad that foremost among all the\r\ntransparencies and banners, comes this flag which speaks of the “Young\r\nMen’s Democratic National Club.”—[Three cheers for Davis.] It is on the\r\nyoung men we must rely. I have found that in every severe political\r\nstruggle, where the contest on the one side was for principle, and on\r\nthe other for spoils, it has been the gray-haired father and the boy\r\nwith the peach bloom upon his cheek upon whom principles had to rely\r\nfor support. My own generation—and I regret to say it—seems too deeply\r\nsteeped in the trickery of politics to be able to rise above the\r\ninfluence of personal and political gain into the pure field of\r\npatriotism. And I am therefore glad to see the “Young Men’s Democratic\r\nNational Club” leading this procession.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the argument I was making. I said that Congress had no\r\npower to legislate upon what should be property anywhere; that Congress\r\nhad no power to discriminate between the citizens of the different\r\nStates who should go into the Territories, the common property of all\r\nthe States, but that those Territories of right remained open to every\r\ncitizen, and every species of property recognized in the Constitution,\r\nuntil the inhabitants should become a people, form a fundamental law\r\nfor themselves, and, as authorized by the Constitution, assume the\r\npowers, duties, and obligations of a State. And now, my friends, I\r\nwould ask you, further, of what value would a congressional decision\r\nupon that subject be? If it be a constitutional right, as I contend it\r\nis, then it is a matter for judicial decision. If Congress should\r\nassert that such is not the right of each of our citizens, and the\r\ncourts appointed as an arbiter in such cases should decide that it is\r\ntheir right, the enactment would, therefore, be void. It, on the other\r\nhand, it is not a right, but Congress should assert it to be one, and\r\nthe courts should declare that no such right exists under the\r\nConstitution, then, Congress has no power to create it; and it is in\r\nthis sense that Congress has not the power to establish or prohibit\r\nslavery anywhere. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nWhat, then, has been the foundation of all this controversy? Your\r\ncandidate has justly pointed out to you that unpatriotic struggle for\r\nsectional aggrandizement which has brought about this contest—a\r\ncontest, as it were, between two contending powers for national\r\npredominance—a contest upon the one side to enlarge the majority it now\r\npossesses, and a contest upon the other side to recover the power it\r\nhas lost, and become the majority. This is the attitude of hostile\r\nnations, and not of States bound together in fraternal unity. This is\r\nthe feeling that one by one is cutting the strands which originally\r\nheld the States together. You have seen your churches divided; you have\r\nseen trade turned aside from its accustomed channel; you have seen\r\njealousy and uncharitableness and bickering springing up and growing\r\nstronger day by day, until at last, if it continue, the cord of union\r\nbetween the States reduced simply to the political strand, may not\r\nsuffice to hold them together. Once united by every tie of fraternal\r\nfeeling, shoulder to shoulder, step by step, our fathers went through\r\nthe revolution, prompted by a common desire for the common good, and\r\nanimated by devotion to the principle of popular liberty. They\r\nstruggled against the mother country, because that country endeavored\r\nto legislate for the colonies, and the colonies claimed as a right that\r\nthey must not be taxed except by their own representatives, and refused\r\nto submit to unconstitutional legislation. If now, in this struggle for\r\nthe ascendency in power, one action should gain such predominance as\r\nwould enable it, by modifying the Constitution and usurping new power,\r\nto legislate for the other, _the exercise of that power would throw us\r\nback into the condition of the colonies._ And if in the veins of the\r\nsons flows the blood of their sires, _they would not fail to redeem\r\nthemselves from tyranny even should they be driven to resort to\r\nrevolution._ [Applause.]\r\n\r\nAnd what is the other question of difference now? It is the agitation,\r\nas a national question, of the right of foreigners to suffrage within\r\nthese States. Now, I ask, what power has Congress over the question?\r\nYet members to Congress are elected upon that question. How would\r\nCongress legislate upon it?—They say, by modifying the naturalization\r\nlaws. What do those laws confer? The right to hold real estate and the\r\nright to devise it by will; the right to sue and be sued in the courts\r\nof the United States; and the rights to receive passports and\r\nprotection from the government of the United States. Who wishes to\r\nwithhold those privileges from foreigners? Nobody alleges it. But they\r\nsay that the ballot-box must be protected from foreign votes. Has\r\nCongress the right to say that foreigners shall not vote within the\r\nlimits of your State? Are you willing to leave that to Congress? [Cries\r\nof “ No, no, no,” and applause.] In some of the States, by State\r\nlegislation, foreigners are permitted to vote before they can become\r\ncitizens under the naturalization laws. The naturalization laws are\r\nnot, therefore, controlling over the question of suffrage. The power of\r\nCongress is limited to the establishment of a uniform rule of\r\nnaturalization throughout the States. But what further do they couple\r\nwith these demands which they make for congressional legislation? They\r\nproclaim their purpose to be to exclude paupers and criminals from\r\nabroad.—Do paupers and criminals come for the right of suffrage? They\r\ncome here for bread, or to fly from the laws which they have violated.\r\nWhether they shall be entitled to vote or not, would neither increase\r\nnor diminish the number of that class by a single individual. But, my\r\nfriends, who is a pauper, or who is a criminal? Is a man a pauper\r\nmerely because he comes here without property, without money in his\r\npurse? Go, look along your lines of internal improvements, where every\r\nmile has mingled with it the bones of some foreigner who labored to\r\ncreate it. Go to your battle fields, where your flag has been borne\r\ntriumphantly, and where fresh laurels have been added to the brow of\r\nyour country, and there you will find the sod dyed as deep by the blood\r\nof the foreign born as by that of the native citizen. [Applause.] Is\r\nthe able-bodied man, who comes here to contribute to your national\r\ninterests by building up your public works, or aiding in the erection\r\nof your architectural constructions, or who bears your flag in the hour\r\nof danger, and who bleeds and dies for your country, is he the pauper\r\nyou desire to exclude? And who is the criminal? Is it he who, flying\r\nfrom the persecution of despotic governments, seeks our land as the\r\nHuguenot did, as did Soule, the stern American orator, as many others\r\nwithin your limits have done under more recent struggles for liberty in\r\nEurope? [Applause.] Then, who are the paupers and criminals? Is that to\r\nbe decided by the ruling of other countries, by the laws of France, or\r\nof England? Or is it to be decided by your own laws, by your own rules\r\nof judicature? If by the latter, then there is no good ground for\r\ncontroversy. We do not advocate that any country shall empty its poor\r\nhouses, get rid of the duty of supporting its paupers, and throw that\r\ncharge upon us. We could not permit any country to empty its prisons\r\nand penitentiaries to mingle that portion of its population with ours.\r\nBut we do war against the use of terms that delude the people, and are\r\nintended to exclude the high-spirited and hard-working men who\r\ncontribute to the bone, the sinew, and the wealth of our country.\r\n[Applause.]\r\n\r\nSuch, then, my friends, is the opposition to the democracy, the only\r\nnational party. The opposition, I say, claims two things from the\r\nfederal government, neither of which it has the constitutional power to\r\nperform. It agitates this section of the Union in relation to property\r\nwhich it has not, and of which, I say, it knows literally nothing. For\r\nhad the orator (Mr. Giddings) who was quoted to-night, known anything\r\nof the relations between the master and the slave, he would not have\r\ntalked of the slave armed with the British bayonet. Our doors are\r\nunlocked at night; we live among them with no more fear of them than of\r\nour cows and oxen. We lie down to sleep trusting to them for our\r\ndefence, and the bond between the master and the slave is as near as\r\nthat which exists between capital and labor anywhere. Now, about the\r\nidea of British bayonets in the hands of slaves: The delusion which has\r\nalways excited my surprise the most has been that which has led so many\r\nof the northern men to strike hands with the British abolitionists to\r\nmake war on their southern brethren. If they could effect their ends,\r\nand Great Britain could insert the wedge which should separate the\r\nStates, what further use would she have for the northern section? You\r\nare the competitors of Great Britain in the vast field of manufacture,\r\nwhom she most fears, and though she may be with you in the scheme which\r\nwould effect a separation of these States, yet the moment that\r\nseparation should be effected she would be under the promptings of\r\ninterest your worst enemy. [Applause.] Our fathers fought and bled to\r\nsecure the common interests of the country. They reclaimed us from\r\ncolonial bondage to national independence. They stamped upon it free\r\ntrade in order that the interests of all might be promoted, that each\r\nsection might be interwoven with the other—in order that there might be\r\nthe strongest bond of mutual dependence. And step by step, from that\r\nday to this, that common and mutual dependence has been growing.\r\n\r\nFrom the seeds of narrow sectionality and purblind fanaticism, have\r\nsprung the tares which threaten the principles of that declaration\r\nwhich made the Colonies independent States, and of that compact by\r\nwhich the States were united by a bond to-day far more valuable than\r\nwhen it was signed. You have among you politicians of a philosophic\r\nturn, who preach a high morality; a system of which they are the\r\ndiscoverers, and it is to be hoped will long remain the exclusive\r\npossessors. They say, it is true the Constitution dictates this, the\r\nBible inculcates that; but there is a higher law than those, and call\r\nupon you to obey that higher law, of which they are the inspired\r\ngivers. [Laughter and applause.] Men who are _traitors_ to the compact\r\nof their fathers—_men who have perjured the oaths they have themselves\r\ntaken_—they who wish to steep their hands in the blood of their\r\nbrothers; these are the moral law-givers who proclaim a higher law than\r\nthe Bible, the Constitution, and the laws of the land. This higher-law\r\ndoctrine, it strikes me, is the most convenient one I ever heard of for\r\nthe _criminal_. You, no doubt, have a law which punishes a man for\r\nstealing a horse or a bale of goods. But the thief would find more\r\nconvenient a higher law which would justify him in keeping the stolen\r\ngoods. The doctrine is now advanced to you only in its relation to\r\nproperty of the Southern States, thus it is the pill gilded, to conceal\r\nits bitterness; but it will re-act deeply upon yourselves if you accept\r\nit. What security have you for your own safety if every man of vile\r\ntemper, of low instincts, of base purpose, can find in his own heart a\r\nhigher law than that which is the rule of society, the Constitution,\r\nand the Bible? _These higher-law preachers should be tarred and\r\nfeathered, and whipped by those they have thus instigated. This, my\r\nfriends, is what was called in good old revolutionary times. Lynch\r\nLaw._ It is sometimes the very best law, because it deals summary\r\njustice upon those who would otherwise escape from all other kinds of\r\npunishment. The man who with sycophantic face and studied phrase, and\r\nwith assumed philosophic morality, preaches treason to the Constitution\r\nand the dictates of all human society, is a fit object for a Lynch law\r\nthat would be higher than any he could urge. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nMy democratic friends, I am deeply gratified by the exhibition which is\r\nbefore me. I see here a field of faces, assembled in the name of\r\nDemocracy, and over it high, bright and multiplied for the occasion, as\r\nstars have been added by Democracy to the flag of our country, blaze\r\nthe lights which typify democratic principles, pointing upward, to\r\nguide our country to that haven of prosperity which our fathers saw in\r\nthe distant future, and which they left it for their sons to attain. It\r\nwe are true to ourselves, true to the obligations which the\r\nConstitution imposes upon us, and if we are wise and energetic in the\r\nstruggles which lie before us, our path is onward to more of national\r\ngreatness than ever people before possessed. We are held together by\r\nthat two-fold government, which is susceptible of being made perfect in\r\nthe small spheres of State limits, and capable of the greatest imperial\r\npower, by the combination of these municipal powers into one for\r\nforeign action. It is a form of government such as the wit of man never\r\ndevised until our fathers, with a wisdom that approached inspiration,\r\nframed the Constitution, and transmitted it as a legacy to us. It\r\ndevolves upon every one of you, to see that each provision of that\r\nConstitution is cordially and faithfully observed. If cordially and\r\nfaithfully observed, the powers of hell and of earth combined can never\r\nshake the happiness and prosperity of the people of the United States.\r\n[Applause.] With every revolving year there will arise new motives for\r\nholding tenaciously to each other. With every revolving cycle there\r\nwill come new sources of pride and national sentiment to the people.\r\nYear after your flag will grow more brilliant, by the addition of fresh\r\nstars, recording the growth of our political family, and onward, over\r\nland and over sea, the progress of American principles, of human\r\nliberty illustrated, and protected by the power of the United States,\r\nwill hold its way to a triumph such as the earth has never witnessed.\r\n[Applause.] On the other hand, what do we see? A picture so black that\r\nif I could unveil it, I would not in this cheery moment expose a scene\r\nso chilling to your enthusiasm, and revolting to your patriotic hearts.\r\nMy friends, feeling that I have already detained you too long, I now\r\nreturn to you my cordial thanks for the kindness with which you have\r\nreceived me to-night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeech Before the Mississippi Legislature.\r\n\r\n\r\nMississippians: Again it is my privilege and good fortune to be among\r\nyou, to stand before those whom I have loved, for whom I have labored,\r\nby whom I have been trusted and honored, and here to answer for myself.\r\nTime and disease have frosted my hair, impaired my physical energies,\r\nand furrowed my brow, but my heart remains unchanged, and its every\r\npulsation is as quick, as strong, and as true to your interests, your\r\nhonor, and fair fame, as in the period of my earlier years.\r\n\r\nIt is known to many of you, that at the close of the last session of\r\nCongress, wasted by protracted, violent disease, I went, in accordance\r\nwith medical advice, to the Northeastern coast of the United States.\r\nAgainst the opinion of my physician, I had remained at Washington until\r\nmy public duties were closed, and then adopted the only course which it\r\nwas believed gave reasonable hope for a final restoration to\r\nhealth—that is, sought a region where I should be exempt from the heat\r\nof summer, and from political excitement.\r\n\r\nIn one respect at least, this accorded with my own feelings, for\r\nphysically and mentally depressed, fearful that I should never again be\r\nable to perform my part in the trials to which Mississippi might be\r\nsubjected, I turned away from my fellows with such feelings as the\r\nwounded elk leaves his herd, and seeks the covert, to die alone.\r\nMisrepresentation and calumny followed me even to the brink of the\r\ngrave, and with hyena instinct would have pursued me beyond it.\r\n\r\nThe political positions which I had always occupied, justified the\r\nexpectation that in New England I should be left in loneliness. In this\r\nI was disappointed; courtesy and kindness met me on my first landing,\r\nand attended me to the time of my departure. The manifestations of\r\ncomity and hospitality, given by the generous and the noble, aroused\r\nthe petty hostility of the more extreme of the Black Republicans, and\r\ntheir newspapers assailed me with the low abuse which for years I had\r\nbeen accustomed to receive at their hands. I had always despised their\r\nmalice and defied their enmity; their assaults did not surprise me, but\r\nwhen I found them echoed in Southern papers, it did astonish, I will\r\nconfess, it did pain me, not for any injury apprehended to myself, but\r\nfor its evil effect upon the cause with which I was identified.\r\n\r\nWas it expected that to public and private manifestations of kindness\r\nby the people of Maine, I should return denunciation and repel their\r\ngenerous approaches with epithets of abuse? If they had deserved such\r\nreproach, they could not merit it at my hands. A guest hospitably\r\nattended, it would have been inconsistent with the character of a\r\ngentleman, to have done less than acknowledge their kindness, and it\r\nwas not in my nature to feel otherwise than grateful to them for the\r\nmany manifestations of a desire to render pleasant and beneficial the\r\nsojourn of an invalid among them. But they did not deserve it, and I am\r\nhappy to state as the result of my acquaintance with them, that we have\r\na large body of true friends among them, men who maintain our\r\nconstitutional rights as explicitly and as broadly as we assert them,\r\nand who have performed this service with the foreknowledge that they\r\nwere thereby to sacrifice their political prospects, at least, until\r\nthrough years of patient exertion they should correct error, suppress\r\nfanaticism, and build for themselves a structure on the basis of truth,\r\nwhich had long been unwelcome and might not soon be understood.\r\n\r\nBut there were other evidences of regard more valuable to me than\r\nexhibitions of personal kindness. Regard for the people of Mississippi,\r\nfounded on a special attention to their history; the gallant services\r\nof your sons in the field, were publicly claimed as property which\r\nMississippi could not appropriate to herself; but which were part of\r\nthe common wealth of the nation, and belonged equally to the people of\r\nMaine. Could I be insensible to such recognition of the honorable fame\r\nof Mississippi? No, the memory of the gallant dead, who died at\r\nMonterey and Buena Vista, forbade it.\r\n\r\nAt a subsequent period, when in Massachusetts, one of her distinguished\r\nsons, (Gen. Cushing,) paid a compliment to the feat performed by the\r\nMississippi Regiment in checking the enemies cavalry on the field of\r\nBuena Vista one Black Republican newspaper denied the originality of\r\nthe movement, and claimed it to have been previously performed by an\r\nEnglish regiment at Quatre Bras. This claim was unfounded; the service\r\nperformed by the British Regiment having been of a totally different\r\ncharacter and for a different purpose.—A Southern paper, however, has\r\ngone one step beyond that of the Massachusetts paper, and denies the\r\nmerit claimed for the service rendered by saying that it was the result\r\nof accident, growing out of the peculiar conformation of the ground on\r\nwhich the regiment rallied and that it was necessary for the safety of\r\nthe regiment, being like the act of a man who leaps from a burning ship\r\nand takes the chance of drowning.\r\n\r\nIf this only affected myself, I should leave it, like other\r\nmisrepresentations, unnoticed, but it concerns the hard earned\r\nreputation of the regiment I commanded. It affects the fame of\r\nMississippi, and propagates an error which may pollute the current of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nWe live in an age of progress, and it requires a progressive age to\r\nproduce a military critic who should discover that a soldier deserved\r\nno credit for availing himself of the accidents of ground. One half of\r\nthe science of war consists in teaching how to take advantage of the\r\nirregularities of the ground on which military movements are to be\r\nmade, or defensive works are to be constructed. The highest reputation\r\nof Generals in every age has resulted in their skill in military\r\ntopography. The most marked compliment ever paid by one General to\r\nanother, was that of Napoleon to Cæsar, when he halted on his\r\nencampments without a previous reconnoisance. But the regiment did not\r\nrally as stated, for it had not been dispersed; neither was their\r\nmovement the result of their own necessity, or adopted for their own\r\nsafety. They were marching by the flank, on the side of a ravine, when\r\nthe enemy’s cavalry were seen approaching. They could have halted on\r\nthe side of the ravine, which was so precipitous that they would have\r\nbeen there as sate from a charge as if they had been in Mississippi.\r\nThey could have gone down into the ravine, and have been concealed even\r\nfrom the sight of the cavalry. The necessity was to prevent the cavalry\r\nfrom passing to the rear of our line of battle, where they might have\r\nattacked, and probably carried our batteries, which were then without\r\nthe protection of our infantry escort. It was our country’s necessity\r\nand not our own which prompted the service there performed. For this\r\nthe regiment was formed square across the plain, and there stood\r\nmotionless as a rock, silent as death, and eager as a greyhound for the\r\napproach of the enemy, at least nine times, numerically, their\r\nsuperiors. Some Indiana troops were formed on the brink of the ravine\r\nwith the right flank of the Mississippi Regiment, constituting one\r\nbranch of what has been called the “V”. When the enemy had approached\r\nas near as he dared and seemed to shrink from contact with the\r\nmotionless, resolute living wall which stood before him, the angry\r\ncrack of the Mississippi rifle was heard, and as the smoke rose and the\r\ndust fell, there remained of the host which so lately stood before us\r\nbut the fallen and the flying. The rear of our line of battle was again\r\nsecured, and a service had been rendered which in no small degree\r\ncontributed to the triumph which finally perched upon the banner of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nI am not a disinterested, and may not be a competent judge, but I know\r\nhow I thought, and still believe, that your sons, given by you to the\r\npublic service in the war with Mexico, have not received the full\r\nmeasure of the credit which was their due. They, however, received so\r\nmuch that we might be content to rest on the history as it has been\r\nwritten. But it constitutes a reason why we should not permit any of\r\nthe leaves to be unjustly torn away.\r\n\r\nTo return to the consideration of the less important subject, the\r\nmisrepresentation of myself; I will again express the surprise I felt\r\nthat when abolition papers were assailing me with a view to destroy any\r\npower which I might acquire to correct the error which had been\r\ninstilled into the minds of the people of the North in relation to\r\nSouthern sentiments and Southern institutions, that they should have\r\nreceived both aid and comfort from Southern newspapers, and been\r\nbolstered up in the attempt to misrepresent my political position. When\r\nthe charge was made, which was copied in Northern papers, that I had\r\nabandoned those with whom I co-operated in 1852, to produce a\r\nseparation of the States, my friend, the editor of the Mississippian,\r\nseeing the misrepresentation of my position, and naturally supposing,\r\nas we had no discussion in 1852, the reference must have been made to\r\nthe canvass of 1851, quoted from the resolutions of the State-Rights\r\nDemocratic Convention, and from an address published by myself to the\r\npeople, to show that my position was the reverse of that assigned to\r\nme. Before proceeding, I will advert to a reference which has been made\r\nto him, as my “organ.” He is no more my “organ” than I am his. We have\r\ngenerally concurred, I and have been able to understand and anticipate\r\nhis positions as he has mine. I am indebted to him for many favors. He\r\nis indebted to me for nothing. As Democrats, as gentlemen, as friends,\r\nwe occupy to each other the relation of exact equality.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that irrefutable answer to the charge, it has been\r\nreiterated, and, as before, located in the year 1852. It is known to\r\nyou all that our discussions were in 1851. I then favored a convention\r\nof the Southern States, that we might take counsel together, as to the\r\nfuture which was to be anticipated, from the legislation of 1850. The\r\ndecision of the State was to acquiesce in the legislation of that year,\r\nwith a series of resolutions in relation to future encroachments. I\r\nsubmitted to the decision of the people, and have in good faith adhered\r\nto the line of conduct which it imposed. Therefore in 1852 there is no\r\nrecord from which to disprove any allegation, but you know the charge\r\nto be utterly unfounded, and charity alone can suppose its reiteration\r\nwas innocently made. Neither in that year nor in any other, have I ever\r\nadvocated a dissolution of the Union, or the separation of the State of\r\nMississippi from the Union, except as the last alternative, and have\r\nnot considered the remedies which lie within that extreme as exhausted,\r\nor ever been entirely hopeless of their success. I hold now, as\r\nannounced on former occasions, that whilst occupying a seat in the\r\nSenate, I am bound to maintain the Government of the Constitution, and\r\nin no manner to work for its destruction; that the obligation of the\r\noath of office, Mississippi’s honor and my own, require that, as a\r\nSenator of the United States, there should be no want of loyalty to the\r\nConstitutional Union. Whenever Mississippi shall resolve to separate\r\nfrom the Confederacy, I will expect her to withdraw her representatives\r\nfrom the General Government, to which they are accredited. If I should\r\never, whilst a Senator, deem it my duty to assume an attitude of\r\nhostility to the Union, I should, immediately thereupon, feel bound to\r\nresign the office, and return to my constituency to inform them of the\r\nfact. It was this view of the obligations of my position, which caused\r\nme, on various occasions, to repel, with such indignation, the\r\naccusation of being a disunionist, while holding the office of Senator\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nI have been represented as having, advocated “Squatter Sovereignty” in\r\na speech made at Bangor, in the State of Maine, A paragraph has been\r\npublished purporting to be an extract from that speech, and\r\nvituperative criticism, and forced construction have exhausted\r\nthemselves upon it, with deductions which are considered authorized,\r\nbecause they are not denied in the paragraph published.\r\n\r\nIn this case, as in that of the charge in relation to my position in\r\n1852, there is no record with which to answer. I never made a speech at\r\nBangor. And a fair mind would have sought for the speech to see how far\r\nthe general context explained the paragraph, before indulging in\r\nhostile criticism.\r\n\r\nSenator Douglas, in a speech at Alton, adopting the paragraph\r\npublished, and evidently drawing his opinion from the unfair\r\nconstruction which had been put upon it, claims to quote from a speech\r\nmade by me at Bangor, to sustain the position taken by him at Freeport.\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n“You will find in a recent speech, delivered by that able and eloquent\r\nstatesman, Hon. Jefferson Davis, at Bangor, Maine, that he took the\r\nsame view of this subject that I did in my Freeport speech. He there\r\nsaid:”\r\n\r\n“‘If the inhabitants of any territory should refuse to enact such laws\r\nand police regulations as would give security to their property and\r\nhis, it would be rendered more or less valueless, in proportion to the\r\ndifficulty of holding it without such protection. In the case of\r\nproperty in the labor of a man, or what is usually called slave\r\nproperty, the insecurity would be so great that the owner could not\r\nordinarily retain it. Therefore, though the right would remain, the\r\nremedy being withheld, it would follow that the owner would be\r\npractically debarred, by the circumstances of the case, from taking\r\nslave property into a Territory where the sense of the inhabitants was\r\nopposed to its introduction. So much for the oft repeated fallacy of\r\nforcing slavery upon any community.’”\r\n\r\nIt is fair to suppose, if the Senator had known where to find the\r\nspeech from which this extract was taken, that he would have examined\r\nit before proceeding to make such use of it. And I can but believe, if\r\nhe had taken the paragraph free from the distortion which it had\r\nundergone from others, that he must have seen it bore no similitude to\r\nhis position at Freeport, and could give no countenance to the doctrine\r\nhe then announced. He there said:\r\n\r\n“The next question Mr. Lincoln propounded to me is: ‘Can the people of\r\na territory exclude slavery from their limits by any fair means, before\r\nit comes into the Union as a State?’ I answer emphatically, as Mr.\r\nLincoln has heard me answer a hundred times, on every stump in\r\nIllinois, that in my opinion, the people of a territory can, by lawful\r\nmeans, exclude slavery before it comes ill as a State. [Cheers.] Mr.\r\nLincoln knew that I had given that answer over and over again. He heard\r\nme argue the Nebraska bill on that principle all over the State, in\r\n1854, and ’55, and ’56, and he has now no excuse to pretend to have any\r\ndoubt upon that subject. Whatever the Supreme Court may hereafter\r\ndecide as on the abstract question of whether slavery may go in under\r\nthe Constitution or not, the people of a territory have the lawful\r\nmeans to admit or exclude it as they please for the reason that slavery\r\ncannot exist a day or an hour anywhere unless supported by local police\r\nregulations, furnishing remedies aid means of enforcing the right of\r\nholding slaves. Those local aid police regulations can only be\r\nfurnished by the local Legislature. If the people of the Territory are\r\nopposed to slavery they will elect members to the Legislature who will\r\nadopt unfriendly legislation to it. If they are for it, they will adopt\r\nthe legislative measures friendly to slavery. Hence no matter what may\r\nbe the decision of the Supreme Court, on that abstract questions still\r\nthe right of the people to make it a slave territory or a free\r\nterritory, is perfect and complete under the Nebraska Bill. I hope Mr.\r\nLincoln will deem my answer satisfactory on this point.” This is the\r\ndistinct assertion of the power of territorial legislation to admit or\r\nexclude slavery; of the first in the race of migration who reach a\r\nterritory, the common property of the people of the United States to\r\nenact laws for the exclusion of other joint owners of the territory,\r\nwho may in the exercise of their equal right to enter the common\r\nproperty, choose to take with them property recognized by the\r\nConstitution, built not acceptable to the first emigrants to the\r\nTerritory. That Senator had too often and too fully discussed with me\r\nthe question of “squatter sovereignty” to be justified in thus\r\nmistaking my opinion. The difference between us is as wide as that of\r\none who should assert the right to rob from him who admitted the power.\r\nIt is true, as I stated it at that time, all property requires\r\nprotection from the society in the midst of which it is held. This\r\nnecessity does not confer a right to destroy, but rather creates an\r\nobligation to protect. It is true as I stated it, that slave property\r\npeculiarly requires the protection of society, and would ordinarily\r\nbecome valueless in the midst of a community, which would seek to\r\nseduce the slave front his master, and conceal him whilst absconding,\r\nand as jurors protect each other in any suit which the master might\r\nbring for damages. The laws of the United States, through the courts of\r\nthe United States, might enable the master to recover the slave\r\nwherever he could find him. But you all know, in such a community as I\r\nhave supposed, that a slave inclined to abscond would become utterly\r\nuseless, and that was the extent of the admission.\r\n\r\nThe extract on which reliance has been placed was taken from a speech\r\nmade at Portland, and both before and after the extract, the language\r\nemployed conclusively disproves the construction, which unfriendly\r\ncriticism has put upon the detached passage. Immediately preceding it,\r\nthe following language was used:\r\n\r\n“The Territory being the common property of States, equals in the\r\nUnion, and bound by the Constitution which recognizes property in\r\nslaves, it is an abuse of terms to call aggression the migration into\r\nthat Territory of one of its joint owners, because carrying with him\r\nany species of property recognized by the Constitution of the United\r\nStates. The Federal Government has no power to declare what is property\r\nenywhere.{sic} The power of each State cannot extend beyond its own\r\nlimits. As a consequence, therefore, whatever is property in any of the\r\nStates, must be so considered in any of the territories of the United\r\nStates until they reach to the dignity of community independence, when\r\nthe subject matter will be entirely under the control of the people,\r\nand be determined by their fundamental law. If the inhabitants of any\r\nterritory should refuse to enact such laws and police regulations as\r\nwould give security to their property or to his, it would be rendered\r\nmore or less valueless, in proportion to the difficulty of holding it\r\nwithout such protection. In the case of property in the labor of man,\r\nor what is usually called slave property, the insecurity would be so\r\ngreat that the owner could not ordinarily retain it. Therefore, though\r\nthe right would remain, the remedy being withheld, it would follow that\r\nthe owner would be practically debarred by the circumstances of the\r\ncase, from taking slave property into a territory where the sense of\r\nthe inhabitants was opposed to its introduction. So much for the oft\r\nrepeated fallacy of forcing slavery upon any community.”\r\n\r\nAnd in a subsequent part of the same speech, the matter was treated of\r\nin this wise:\r\n\r\n“The South had not asked Congress to extend slavery into the\r\nterritories, and he in common with most other Southern statesmen,\r\ndenied the existence of any power to do so. He held it to be the creed\r\nof the Democracy, both in the North and the South, that the general\r\ngovernment had no constitutional power either to establish or prohibit\r\nslavery anywhere; a grant of power to do the one must necessarily have\r\ninvolved the power to do the other. Hence it is their policy not to\r\ninterfere on the one side or the other, but protecting each individual\r\nin his constitutional rights, to leave every independent community to\r\ndetermine and adjust all domestic questions as in their wisdom may seem\r\nbest.”\r\n\r\nIn other speeches made elsewhere, in New England and in New York the\r\nequality of the South as joint owners was declared and maintained, as I\r\nhad often done before the people of Mississippi and in the Senate of\r\nthe United States when the subject was in controversy. The position\r\ntaken by me in 1850, in the form of an amendment offered to one of the\r\ncompromise measures of that year, was intended to assert the equal\r\nright of all property to the protection of the United States, and to\r\ndeny to any legislative body the power to abridge that right. The\r\ndecision of the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case has fully\r\nsustained our position in the following passage:\r\n\r\n“If Congress itself cannot do this, (prohibit slavery in a Territory,)\r\nif it is beyond the powers conferred on the Federal Government—it will\r\nbe admitted, we presume, that it could not authorize a territorial\r\ngovernment to exercise them. _It could confer no power on any local\r\ngovernment established by its authority, to violate the provisions of\r\nthe Constitution._\r\n\r\n“And if the Constitution recognizes the right of property of the master\r\nin a slave; and makes no distinction between that description of\r\nproperty and other property owned by a citizen, _no tribunal_, acting\r\nunder the authority of the United States, whether legislative,\r\nexecutive, or judicial, has a right to draw such a distinction, or deny\r\nto it the benefit of the provisions and guarantees which have been\r\nprovided for the protection of private property against the\r\nencroachments of the government.”\r\n\r\nAt the time of the adoption of the Kansas-Nebraska bill, it certainly\r\nwas understood that the constitutional rights to take slaves into any\r\nterritory of the United States should thenceforth be regarded as a\r\njudicial question; and therefore special provision was made to\r\nfacilitate the bringing of such questions before the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States. After the decision to which reference has just been\r\nmade, the prominent advocate of the bill at the time of its enactment\r\nshould have been estopped from recurring to his “squatter sovereignty”\r\nheresies, though the decision should have been different from his\r\nanticipation or desire. And as much interest has been felt in relation\r\nto his position, and some inquiry has been made as to my view of it, I\r\nwill here say, that I consider him as having recanted the better\r\nopinions announced by him in 1854, and that I cannot be compelled to\r\nchoose between men, one of whom asserts the power of Congress to\r\ndeprive us of a constitutional right, and the other only denies the\r\npower of Congress, in order to transfer it to the territorial\r\nlegislature. Neither the one nor the other has any authority to sit in\r\njudgment on our rights under the Constitution.\r\n\r\nBetween such positions, Mississippi cannot have a preference, because\r\nshe cannot recognize anything tolerable in either of them.\r\n\r\nHaving called your attention to the speech made at Portland, to show\r\nthat other parts of it disprove the construction put upon the\r\nparagraph, which was taken from it, and reported to be a part of the\r\nspeech delivered at Bangor, it may be as well on this occasion to state\r\nthe circumstances under which the speech was made at Portland.\r\nImmediately preceding the State election, I was invited, by the\r\ndemocracy of that city, to address them, and my attention was\r\nespecially called to a delusion practiced on the people of Maine, by\r\nwhich many were led to believe that there was a purpose on the part of\r\nthe South, through the government of the United States, to force\r\nslavery not only into the territories, but also into the\r\nnon-slaveholding States of the Union. It was represented to me that in\r\nthe last Presidential canvass that one of the Senators of Maine had\r\nconvinced many of the voters that if Mr. Buchanan should be elected,\r\nslavery would be forced upon Maine, and that the other Senator was\r\narguing that the Dred Scott decision of the Supreme Court had given\r\nauthority to introduce and hold slaves in that State. To counteract\r\nsuch impressions, injurious to the South and her friends, the remarks\r\nwhich have been extracted were made.\r\n\r\nOn that, as on other occasions, it was deemed a duty to correct\r\nmisrepresentation and seek to vindicate our purposes from the prejudice\r\nwhich ignorance and agitation had created against us. If it was in my\r\npower in any degree to allay sectional excitement, to cultivate sounder\r\nopinions and a more fraternal feeling, it was a task most acceptable to\r\nme, and one for the performance of which I could not doubt your\r\napproval. But it has been my fortune to be the object of a malice which\r\nI have not striven to appease because I was conscious that it rested\r\nupon no injury or injustice inflicted by me. The land swarms with\r\nPresidential candidates, announced by their agents or their friends, or\r\nby themselves, as the mode most available for preventing too zealous\r\nand partial friends from putting them in nomination. To these it was\r\nthe source of unfounded apprehension, that I went to the coast of New\r\nEngland, instead of returning to Mississippi. If any of them had known\r\nthe necessity which kept me from home, it is fair to suppose the\r\naspirant for such distinction could not have been guilty of the\r\nmeanness of suppressing that fact, and allowing misrepresentation to do\r\nits work in my absence.\r\n\r\nFor the wretch who is doomed to go through the world bearing a personal\r\njealousy or a personal malignity, which renders him incapable of doing\r\njustice, and studious of misrepresentation, I can only feel pity, and\r\nwere it possible to feel revengeful, could consign him to no worse\r\npunishment than that of his own tormentors, the vipers nursed in his\r\nown breast.\r\n\r\nBut long have I delayed what is my chief purpose, to speak to my\r\nfriends, the men whose good opinion is to me of importance only second\r\nto the approval of my own conscience. So far as they have misunderstood\r\nme, it is a pleasure to set forth the true meaning of both my words and\r\nmy deeds. To my traducers I have no explanations to offer and no\r\napologies for any one. If State Rights men in the excess of their zeal\r\nhave censured me, I have no reproaches for them, but cheerfully bear\r\nthe burden which may be imposed upon me by zeal in the cause to which\r\nmy political life has been devoted, and in imitation of Job, would\r\nbless the State Rights Democracy of Mississippi, even if the object of\r\nits vengeance: “Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him.”\r\n\r\nIf I had been asked what interpretation might possibly be put upon the\r\npublished sketch of the remarks made by me at sea on the Fourth of July\r\nlast, speculation would have been exhausted before it would have\r\noccurred to me that my State Rights friends would consider themselves\r\ndescribed under the head of “trifling politicians,” who could not\r\nbelieve that the country would remain united to repel insult to our\r\nflag as it had recently been on the occasion of the attempt to exercise\r\nvisit and search in the Gulf of Mexico, under the pretext of checking\r\nthe African slave trade. The publisher of that sketch has already\r\nannounced that it was not a report, and that for its language I could\r\nnot justly be considered responsible. To this it is needless that I\r\nshould add any thing. But I have treated it, and will treat it in the\r\nview necessarily taken by those who construed it before such denial was\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of greatest adversity, in the hour of gloom and\r\ndefeat, the State Rights Democracy had no cause to complain of my\r\nfealty. We struggled together, fell together, rose together, and to\r\nthem I am indebted for whatever of consideration or position I possess.\r\nEndeared to me by our common suffering; grateful to them for the\r\nsteadfast support with which they have honored me, accustomed to refer\r\nwith pride to my identity with them, it would have been strange indeed,\r\nif when separated from them under circumstances which turned any eyes,\r\nwith more than ordinary anxiety towards my home, I should then have\r\nsought an occasion to heap reproachful language upon them.\r\n\r\nOften it has been my duty to repel the accusations of others who sought\r\nto attribute to the State Rights Democracy opinions not their own, and\r\nto impute to them the purpose to agitate for the destruction of the\r\ngovernment we inherited. As one of the State Rights party, I deny that\r\nthe language published is a picture of me or my class, and I have as\r\nlittle disposition now, as at any former time, to separate myself from\r\nthe body of the party, with which I have so long acted, which I rejoice\r\nto see in power at home, and daily more and more respected in the other\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nI have thus defined who were not meant, and will now tell who were\r\nmeant. Firsts they were the noisy agitators who were constantly\r\ndisturbing the public peace and proclaiming that slavery is so great an\r\nevil, that the preservation of the Union is subordinate to the purpose\r\nof abolishing it. They who object to any protection, on the high seas\r\nor elsewhere, being given to slave property by the government of the\r\nUnited States; who would rejoice in any insult offered to the national\r\nflag if borne by a vessel sailing from a Southern port; and who have\r\nbeen for some time back circulating petitions for a dissolution of the\r\nUnion on the ground of the incompatibility of the sections. And to\r\nthese may be added the few, the very few of Southern men who fancying\r\nthat they would have advantages out of the Union which they cannot\r\npossess within it, however fully the compact should be observed and\r\nState Equality maintained, desire its dissolution, and taking counsel\r\nof their passions, decry the labors of all who seek to preserve the\r\ngovernment as our fathers formed it, and to develop the great purposes\r\nfor which it was ordained and established.\r\n\r\nThe other phrase which has been the subject of comment was, “and this\r\ngreat country will remain united.” How “united” is set forth in the\r\nlanguage to which this clause was a conclusion, “united to protect our\r\nnational flag whenever a foreign power, presuming on our domestic\r\ndissention, should dare to insult it.” The unanimity with which men of\r\nall parties in the two houses of Congress rallied to support the\r\nexecutive in maintaining the rights of our flag, had been the subject\r\nof my commendation. Upon that fact the idea expressed rested. At worst\r\nit could but have evinced too much credulity, and I trust I may die\r\nbelieving that whenever the honor of our flag shall demand it, every\r\nmountain and valley and plain, will pour forth their hardy sons, and\r\nthat shoulder to shoulder they will march against any foreign foe which\r\nshall invade the rights of any portion of the United States.\r\n\r\nAnd here permit me as a duty to you, and an obligation upon myself, to\r\npay the tribute which I believe to be due the Northern Democracy.\r\nHaving formed my opinion of them upon insufficient data, I have had\r\noccasion, after much intercourse with them, to modify it. I believe\r\nthat a great reaction has commenced; how far it will progress I do not\r\npretend to say, but am hopeful that agitation will soon become\r\nunprofitable to political traders in New England, and this hope rests\r\nupon the high position taken by the Northern Democracy, and upon the\r\nincreased vote which in some of the States, under the more distinct\r\navowal of sound principles, their candidates have received. You may now\r\noften hear among them not only the unqualified defence of your\r\nconstitutional rights, but the vindication of your institutions in the\r\nabstract, and in the concrete.\r\n\r\nIn the town of Portland, just preceding the election, a Democrat of\r\nlarge means and extensively engaged in commercial transactions and city\r\nimprovements addressed the Democracy, arguing that their prosperity\r\ndepended upon their connection with countries, the products of which\r\nwere dependent upon slave labor; and the future growth and prosperity\r\nof their city depended upon the extension of slave labor into all\r\ncountries where it could be profitably employed. He showed by a\r\nstatistical statement the paralysing effect which would be produced\r\nupon their interest by the abolition of slavery. The Black Republican\r\npapers of course abused him, and compared him to Davis and Toombs, but\r\nhis sound views were approved by the Democracy, and so far as I could\r\njudge, he gained consideration by their manly utterance.\r\n\r\nA generation had been educated in error, and the South had done nothing\r\nin defence of the abstract right of slavery. Within a few years essays\r\nhave been written, books have been published, by northern as well as by\r\nsouthern men, and with the increase of information, there has been a\r\nsubsidence of prejudice, and a preparation of the mind to receive\r\ntruth. Our friends are still in a minority. It would be vain to\r\nspeculate as to the period when their position will be reversed.\r\nWhether sooner or later, or never, they are still entitled to our\r\nregard and respect. A few years ago those who maintained our\r\nconstitutional right, and to secure it voted for the Kansas and\r\nNebraska bill, went home to meet reproach and expulsions from public\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\nEven their social position was affected by that political act. The few\r\nyears, however, which have elapsed, have produced a great change. They\r\nhave recovered all except their political position. That bill which was\r\nconsidered when it was enacted, a Southern measure, for which Northern\r\nmen bravely sacrificed their political prospects, has of late been\r\ndenounced at the South as a cheat and a humbug. A poor return\r\ncertainly, to those who conscientiously maintaining our rights,\r\nsurrendered their popularity to secure what the men for whom they made\r\nthe sacrifice now pronounce to have been a cheat. It is true that bill\r\nhas recently received in some quarters a construction which its friends\r\ndid not place upon it when it was enacted. But it should be judged by\r\nits terms and by contemporaneous construction.\r\n\r\nWhen I visited the people of Mississippi last year, the question of\r\ngreatest public excitement, was connected with the action of the\r\nExecutive in relation to the admission of Kansas as a State of the\r\nUnion. You had been led to suppose that the President would attempt to\r\ncontrol the action of the convention, and if the constitution was not\r\nsubmitted to a popular vote, would oppose by all the means within his\r\npower, the admission of the State within the Union. You were also\r\nexcited at a dogma which had been put forth, to the effect that no more\r\nslave States should be admitted. I agreed with you then, that if the\r\nPresident took such position he would violate the obligations of his\r\noffice, and be faithless to the trust which you had reposed in him. I\r\nagreed with you then, that the exclusion of a State, because it was\r\nslaveholding, would be such an offence against your equality as would\r\ndemand at your hands the vindication of your rights. What has been the\r\nresult? The convention framed the constitution, submitted only the\r\nclause relating to slavery to a popular vote, and applied for\r\nadmission. The President in his annual message referred in favorable\r\nterms to the application, then not formally made, and when the\r\nConstitution reached him transmitted it to Congress with a special\r\nmessage, in which he fully and emphatically maintained the right of\r\nadmission.\r\n\r\nAfter the convention had adjourned, Mr. Stanton, acting Governor of the\r\nTerritory, called and extra session of the Freesoil Legislature, which\r\nhas been elected, and it passed an act to submit the whole constitution\r\nto a popular vote. The President removed him from office,—a further\r\nevidence of the sincerity with which he was fulfiling your expectations\r\nin relation to Kansas. And it gives me pleasure here to say of him,\r\nwhat I am assured I can now say with confidence, that he will not\r\nshrink a hair’s breadth from the position he has taken, but will move\r\nanother step in advance, and fall, if fall he must, manfully upholding\r\nthe rights and defying the insolence of ill-gotten power.\r\n\r\nWhen the bill was presented to the Senate for the admission of the\r\nState of Kansas, after a long discussion, it was adopted, with a\r\nprovision which required the State after admission to relinquish its\r\nclaim to all the land asked for in its ordinance, except 5,000,000\r\nacres, that being the largest amount which had been ever granted to a\r\nState at the period of its admission. There was also a provision\r\ndeclaratory of the right of the people to change their constitution at\r\nany time; though the instrument itself had restricted them for a term\r\nof years. I considered both those provisions objectionable; the first,\r\nbecause it was directory of legislation to be enacted by a State; and\r\nthe second, because it was inviting to a disregard of the fundamental\r\nlaw, and had too much the seeming of a concession to the anti-slavery\r\nfeeling which was impatient for a change of the constitution. That bill\r\nfailed in the House, and was succeeded by a bill of the Opposition\r\nwhich recognized the right of Kansas to be admitted with a pro-slavery\r\nconstitution, provided it should be adopted by a popular vote. This\r\nalso failed, and in the division between the two Houses, a com- {sic}\r\n\r\nAs there has been much diversity of opinion in relation to that law,\r\nand I think much misapprehension as to its character, I will be\r\npardoned for speaking of it somewhat minutely.\r\n\r\nWhen it was known that the Conference Committee had prepared a bill, I\r\nmittee of conference was appointed, which framed the bill that became a\r\nlaw. being at the time confined to my house by disease, invited my\r\ncolleague and the Representatives from the State to visit me, that we\r\nmight confer together and decide upon the course which we would pursue.\r\nBefore the evening of our meeting, a distinguished member of the House\r\nof Representatives, a member of the Committee, called and read to me\r\nthe bill which they had prepared. It contained some features which I\r\nconsidered objectionable. He concurred with me, and promised to use his\r\nefforts to have them stricken out. When the Mississippi delegation\r\nassembled, our conference was full, and marked by the desire, first to\r\nprotect the rights of our State, and secondly, to secure unanimity of\r\naction by its delegation. The objections which were urged, referred, as\r\nmy memory serves me, entirely to the features which I had reason to\r\nhope would be stricken out. One of the delegation announced an\r\nunwillingness to support the proposed modification of the Senate\r\nproposition, lest it should be considered as yielding the point on\r\nwhich we had insisted that Congress could not require the Constitution\r\nto be submitted to a popular vote. I refer to the lamented Quitman,\r\nwhose sincere devotion to Southern interests, no one, who knew him,\r\ncould question. I regretted that he deemed it necessary to vote,\r\nfinally, against the measure, but I honor the motive which governed his\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThe ordinance which was attached to the Constitution, was not a part of\r\nit, but a condition annexed to the application for admission. If\r\nCongress had stricken the ordinance out, the effect, I believe, would\r\nhave been that of admitting the State without any reservation of the\r\npublic land; would have transferred as an attribute of sovereignty the\r\nuseful as well as the eminent domain. The Southern Senators who\r\nreceived the soubriquet of Southern ultras, held that position in 1850,\r\nin relation to the public lands of California, and it constituted one\r\nof their objections to the admission of that State at the time it was\r\neffected. To modify the ordinance, that is to change the condition on\r\nwhich the inhabitants of Kansas proposed to enter into the Union was\r\nnecessarily to give them the right to withdraw their proposition.\r\n\r\nIt remained then for Congress if they reduced the amount of land asked\r\nfor in the ordinance, either to provide the mode in which the\r\ninhabitants should accept or reject the modification or leave them to\r\ndo it in such manner as they might adopt. The convention was defunct,\r\nthe legislature was black republican and thought to be entitled to\r\nlittle confidence, and it seemed to be better that Congress should\r\nitself provide the mode of ascertaining the public will than leave that\r\nduty to the territorial legislature, such as it was believed and proven\r\nto be. It was a mere question of expediency, and I think the best\r\ncourse was pursued.\r\n\r\nTo have admitted the State without modification of the ordinance, would\r\nhave been to grant five times as much of the public land as had ever\r\nbeen given to a State at the period of admission.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to justify such a discrimination, and otherwise the\r\nState could not be admitted without referring the question or violating\r\nthe principle of State sovereignty.\r\n\r\nAs a condition precedent, the general government may require the\r\nrecognition of its right to control the primary disposal of the land,\r\nbut can have no right to impose a condition with the mandate that it\r\nshall be subsequently fulfiled and no power to enforce the mandate if\r\nthe State admitted should refuse to comply. Not for all the land in\r\nKansas, not for all the land between the Missouri and the Pacific\r\nocean, not for all the land of the continent of North America, would I\r\nagree that the federal government should have the power to coerce a\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for having all conditions agreed upon before the\r\nadmission of a State was demonstrated by Mr. Soule, in 1850, in the\r\ndiscussion of the bill for the admission of California. Mr. Webster\r\nreplied to him but did not answer his argument, and the course of\r\nevents seems likely to verify all that Senator Soule foretold.\r\n\r\nOf the three methods which were supposable, I think Congress adopted\r\nthe best; it was the only one which was attainable and secured all\r\nwhich was of value to the South. It was the admission by Congress of a\r\nState with a pro-slavery Constitution; it was the triumph of the\r\nprinciple that forbade Congress to interfere either as to the matter of\r\nthe Constitution or the manner in which it should be formed and\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nThe refusal of the inhabitants to accept the reduced endowment offered\r\nto them, and their decision to remain in a territorial condition, was,\r\nin my opinion, wise on their part and fortunate on ours. The late\r\nGovernor, Denver, has forcibly pointed out to them their want of means\r\nto support a State government, and the propriety of giving their first\r\nattention to the establishment of order and the development of their\r\ninternal resources. There were many reasons to doubt the fitness of the\r\ninhabitants of Kansas to be admitted as a State.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the country and the previous legislation of Congress\r\nmade the case exceptional, and, in my judgment, justified the course\r\nadopted. I have, therefore, no apology or regret to offer in the case.\r\n\r\nThe Northern opponents of the measure have, among other denunciatory\r\nepithets, applied to it those of “bribery” and “coercion.” “Bribery” to\r\ngive less by twenty millions of acres of land than was claimed, and\r\n“coercion” to leave them to the option of receiving the usual\r\nendowment, or waiting until they had an amount of population which\r\nwould give some assurance of their ability to maintain a State\r\ngovernment. Though such is the requirement of the law, and designed to\r\nsecure exemption from the mischievous agitation which has for several\r\nyears disturbed the country and benefitted only the demagogues who make\r\na trade of politics, we may scarcely hope to escape from a renewal of\r\nthe agitation which has been found so profitable. The next phase of the\r\nquestion will probably be in the form of what is termed an “enabling\r\nact,”—a favorite measure with the advocates of “squatter sovereignty,”\r\nwho, claiming for the inhabitants of a Territory all the power of the\r\npeople of a State, nevertheless consider it necessary that Congress\r\nshould confer the power to form a Constitution and apply as a State.\r\nCongress has given authority for admission in some cases, but I think\r\nit better to avoid than to follow the precedent. Not that I am\r\nconcerned for the doctrine of “squatter sovereignty,” but that I would\r\nguard against the mischievous error of considering the federal\r\ngovernment as the parent of States, and would restrict it to the\r\nfunction of admitting new States into the Union, barring all pretension\r\nto the power of creating them.\r\n\r\nIt seems now to be probable that the Abolitionists and their allies\r\nwill have control of the next House of Representatives, and it may be\r\nwell inferred from their past course that they will attempt legislation\r\nboth injurious and offensive to the South. I have an abiding faith that\r\nany law which violates our constitutional rights, will be met with a\r\nveto by the present Executive.—But should the next House of\r\nRepresentatives be such as would elect an Abolition President, we may\r\nexpect that the election will be so conducted as probably to defeat a\r\nchoice by the people and devolve the election upon the House.\r\n\r\nWhether by the House or by the people, if an Abolitionist be chosen\r\nPresident of the United States, you will have presented to you the\r\nquestion of whether you will permit the government to pass into the\r\nhands of your avowed and implacable enemies. Without pausing for your\r\nanswer, I will state my own position to be that such a result would be\r\na species of revolution by which the purposes of the Government would\r\nbe destroyed and the observance of its mere forms entitled to no\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nIn that event, in such manner as should be most expedient, I should\r\ndeem it your duty to provide for your safety outside of a Union with\r\nthose who have already shown the will, and would have acquired the\r\npower, to deprive you of your birthright and to reduce you to worse\r\nthan the colonial dependence of your fathers.\r\n\r\nThe master mind of the so-called Republican party, Senator Seward, has\r\nin a. recent speech at Rochester, announced the purpose of his party to\r\ndislodge the Democracy from the possession of the federal Government,\r\nand assigns as a reason the friendship of that party for what he\r\ndenominates the slave system. He declares the Union between the States\r\nhaving slave labor and free labor to be incompatible, and announces\r\nthat one or the other must disappear. He even asserts that it was the\r\npurpose of the framers of the Government to destroy slave property, and\r\ncites as evidence of it, the provision for an amendment of the\r\nConstitution. He seeks to alarm his auditors by assuring them of the\r\npurpose on the part of the South and the Democratic party to force\r\nslavery upon all the States of the Union. Absurd as all this may seem\r\nto you, and incredulous as you may be of its acceptance by any\r\nintelligent portion of the citizens of the United States, I have reason\r\nto believe that it has been inculcated to no small extent in the\r\nNorthern mind.\r\n\r\nIt requires but a cursory examination of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates; but a partial knowledge of its history and of the motives of\r\nthe men who formed it, to see how utterly fallacious it is to ascribe\r\nto them the purpose of interfering with the domestic institutions of\r\nany of the States. But if a disrespect for that instrument, a fanatical\r\ndisregard of its purposes, should ever induce a majority, however\r\nlarge, to seek by amending the Constitution, to pervert it from its\r\noriginal object, and to deprive you of the equality which your fathers\r\nbequeathed to you, I say let the star of Mississippi be snatched from\r\nthe constellation to shine by its inherent light, if it must be so,\r\nthrough all the storms and clouds of war.\r\n\r\nThe same dangerously powerful man describes the institution of slavery\r\nas degrading to labor, as intolerant and inhuman, and says the white\r\nlaborer among us is not enslaved only because he cannot yet be reduced\r\nto bondage. Where he learned his lesson, I am at a loss to imagine;\r\ncertainly not by observation, for you all know that by interest, if not\r\nby higher motive, slave labor bears to capital as kind a relation as\r\ncan exist between them anywhere; that it removes from us all that\r\ncontroversy between the laborer and the capitalist, which has filled\r\nEurope with starving millions and made their poor houses an onerous\r\ncharge. You too know, that among us, white men have an equality\r\nresulting from a presence of the lower caste, which cannot exist where\r\nwhite men fill the position here occupied by the servile race. The\r\nmechanic who comes among us, employing the less intellectual labor of\r\nthe African, takes the position which only a master-workman occupies\r\nwhere all the mechanics are white, and therefore it is that our\r\nmechanics hold their position of absolute equality among us.\r\n\r\nI say to you here as I have said to the Democracy of New York, if it\r\nshould ever come to pass that the Constitution shall be perverted to\r\nthe destruction of our rights so that we shall have the mere right as a\r\nfeeble minority unprotected by the barrier of the Constitution to give\r\nan ineffectual negative vote in the Halls of Congress, we shall then\r\nbear to the federal government the relation our colonial fathers did to\r\nthe British crown, and if we are worthy of our lineage we will in that\r\nevent redeem our rights even if it be through the process of\r\nrevolution. And it gratifies me to be enabled to say that no portion of\r\nthe speech to which I have referred was received with more marked\r\napprobation by the Democracy there assembled than the sentiment which\r\nhas just been cited. I am happy also to state that during the past\r\nsummer I heard in many places, what previously I had only heard from\r\nthe late President Pierce, the declaration that whenever a Northern\r\narmy should be assembled to march for the subjugation of the South,\r\nthey would have a battle to fight at home before they passed the limits\r\nof their own State, and one in which our friends claim that the victory\r\nwill at least be doubtful.\r\n\r\nNow, as in 1851, I hold separation from the Union by the State of\r\nMississippi to be the last remedy—the final alternative. In the\r\nlanguage of the venerated Calhoun I consider the disruption of the\r\nUnion as a great though not the greatest calamity. I would cling\r\ntenaciously to our constitutional Government, seeing as I do in the\r\nfraternal Union of equal States the benefit to all and the fulfilment\r\nof that high destiny which our fathers hoped for and left it for their\r\nsons to attain. I love the flag of my country with even more than a\r\nfilial affection. Mississippi gave me in my boyhood to her military\r\nservice. For many of the best years of my life I have followed that\r\nflag and upheld it on fields where if I had fallen it might have been\r\nclaimed as my winding sheet. When I have seen it surrounded by the\r\nflags of foreign countries, the pulsations of my heart have beat\r\nquicker with every breeze which displayed its honored stripes and\r\nbrilliant constellation. I have looked with veneration on those stripes\r\nas recording the original size of our political family and with pride\r\nupon that constellation as marking the family’s growth; I glory in the\r\nposition which Mississippi’s star holds in the group; but sooner than\r\nsee its lustre dimmed—sooner than see it degraded from its present\r\nequality-would tear it from its place to be set even on the perilous\r\nridge of battle as a sign round which Mississippi’s best and bravest\r\nshould gather to the harvest-home of death.\r\n\r\nAs when I had the privilege of addressing the Legislature a year ago,\r\nso now do I urge you to the needful preparation to meet whatever\r\ncontingency may befall us. The maintenance of our rights against a\r\nhostile power is a physical problem and cannot be solved by mere\r\nresolutions. Not doubtful of what the heart will prompt, it is not the\r\nless proper that due provision should be made for physical necessities.\r\nWhy should not the State have an armory for the repair of arms, for the\r\nalteration of old models so as to make them conform to the improved\r\nweapons of the present day, and for the manufacture on a limited scale\r\nof new arms, including cannon and their carriages; the casting of shot\r\nand shells, and the preparation of fixed ammunition?\r\n\r\nSuch preparation will not precipitate us upon the trial of secession,\r\nfor I hold now, as in 1850, that Mississippi’s patriotism will hold her\r\nto the Union as long as it is constitutional, but it will give to our\r\nconduct the character of earnestness of which mere paper declarations\r\nhave somewhat deprived us; it will strengthen the hands of our friends\r\nat the North, and in the event that separation shall be forced upon us,\r\nwe shall be prepared to meet the contingency with whatever remote\r\nconsequences may follow it, and give to manly hearts the happy\r\nassurance that manly arms will not fail to protect the gentle beauty\r\nwhich blesses our land and graces the present occasion.\r\n\r\nYou are already progressing in the construction of railroads which,\r\nwhilst they facilitate travel, increase the products of the State and\r\nthe reward of the husbandman, are a great element of strength by the\r\nmeans they afford for rapid combination at any point where it may be\r\ndesirable to concentrate our forces. To those already in progress I\r\nhope one will soon be added to connect the interior of the State with\r\nthe best harbor upon our Gulf coast. When this shall be completed a\r\ntrade will be opened to that point which will produce direct\r\nimportation and exportation to the great advantage of the planter as\r\nwell as all consumers of imported goods; and furnishing “exchange,”\r\nwill protect us from such revulsion as was suffered last fall when\r\nduring a period of entire prosperity at home, our market was paralyzed\r\nby failures in New York.\r\n\r\nThe contemplated improvement in the levee system, will give to our\r\npeople a mine of untold wealth; and as we progress in the development\r\nof our resources and the increase of our power, so will we advance in\r\nState pride and the ability to maintain principles far higher in value\r\nthan mountains of gold or oceans of pearl.\r\n\r\nBut I find myself running into those visions which have hung before me\r\nfrom my boyhood up; which at home and abroad have been the hope\r\nconstantly attending upon me, and which the cold wing of time has been\r\nunable to wither. I am about to leave you to discharge the duties of\r\nthe high trust with which you have honored me. I go with the same love\r\nfor Mississippi which has always animated me; with the same confidence\r\nin her people, which has cheered me in the darkest hour. As often as I\r\nmay return to you, I feel secure of myself, and say I shall come back\r\nunchanged. Or should the Providence which has so often kindly protected\r\nme, not permit me to return again, my last prayer will be for the\r\nhonor, the glory and the happiness of Mississippi.",
