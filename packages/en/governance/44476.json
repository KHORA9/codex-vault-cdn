T. STEAD,\r\n  AUTHOR OF “IF CHRIST CAME TO CHICAGO!”\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Inasmuch as no government can endure in which corrupt\r\n  greed not only makes the laws but decides who shall\r\n  construe them, many of our best citizens are beginning\r\n  to despair of the Republic.”--EX-GOVERNOR ALTGELD,\r\n  _Labour Day_, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The “Review of Reviews” Annual, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n  EDITORIAL OFFICES:\r\n  MOWBRAY HOUSE, NORFOLK STREET, LONDON, W.C.\r\n\r\n  PUBLISHING OFFICE:\r\n  125, FLEET STREET, LONDON, E.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  LONDON:\r\n  PRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED,\r\n  STAMFORD STREET AND CHARING CROSS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the past four years I have devoted the ANNUAL of the REVIEW OF REVIEWS\r\nto a romance based upon the leading social or political event of the year.\r\nThis year I intermit the publication of the Series of Contemporary History\r\nin Fiction in order to publish a study of the most interesting and\r\nsignificant of all the political and municipal problems of our time. To\r\nthose who may object to the substitution of a companion volume to my\r\nChicago book for their usual annual quantum of political romance, I reply,\r\nfirst, that “changes are lightsome” and a novelty is attractive, and,\r\nsecondly, that nothing that the wildest imagination of the romance-writer\r\ncould conceive exceeds in startling and sensational horror the grim\r\noutline of the facts which are set forth in this survey of that section of\r\n“Satan’s Invisible World” which was brought to light by the Lexow\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nThe trite old saying that “Truth is stranger than Fiction” has seldom been\r\nbetter exemplified than in the story of the way in which the Second City\r\nin the World has been governed, unless it be in the consequences of the\r\nresulting despair. For if the revelations made before the Lexow Committee\r\nare almost incredible, the deliberate decision of the ablest and most\r\npublic-spirited Americans that there is no way of escape save by the\r\nhamstrung Cæsarism of the Charter of Greater New York is still more\r\nmarvellous as a confession of the shipwreck of faith. Sin, when it has\r\nconceived, bringeth forth Death, and the corruption that rotted the\r\nadministration previous to 1894 has only brought forth its natural fruit\r\nin the adoption of a bastard Bonapartism of the Second Empire as the best\r\ngovernment for the First City in the American Republic.\r\n\r\nThe election of the first Mayor for Greater New York, which is progressing\r\nwhile these pages are being written, gives a special actuality and\r\ninterest to this study. But its permanent value does not depend upon the\r\nissue of the _plébiscite_ which has decided who will sway the destinies of\r\nthe Second City of the World at the eve and on the dawn of the Twentieth\r\nCentury.\r\n\r\nIt will, I hope, render available to the whole English-speaking world the\r\ngist and essence of the evidence taken before the Committee appointed by\r\nthe Senate of the State of New York to inquire into the Police Department\r\nof the City. This Committee, presided over by Senator Lexow, held seventy\r\nsittings in the year 1894, and ultimately published the Report of their\r\ninquiry in five stout octavo volumes of 1100 pages each. All their\r\nproceedings were public, and the New York papers published ample reports\r\nfrom day to day. Outside New York nothing but brief telegrams or\r\noccasional letters informed the world of what was taking place, and the\r\nfinal Report was never published in the British or Colonial press. Yet the\r\nlesson of the state of things revealed by the Lexow Committee was one\r\nwhich every great city would do well to take to heart. What New York was,\r\nLondon, Glasgow, or Melbourne may--nay, will certainly--become, if the\r\ncitizens lose interest in the good government of their city.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in New York in September, I tried in vain to purchase a copy of\r\nthe Lexow Report. As for exhuming the files of the daily papers, one might\r\nas well try to resurrect Cheops. Fortunately, just as I was stepping on\r\nboard the _Teutonic_, the five bulky volumes were handed over to me as a\r\nloan. Dr. Shaw had at the last moment succeeded in borrowing the office\r\ncopy of the Report from the Society for the Prevention of Crime. It was\r\napparently the only available set in the whole city. I deemed it well\r\ntherefore to master the voluminous evidence in order to construct a\r\nreadable and authentic narrative which would make this great object-lesson\r\naccessible to the world.\r\n\r\nW.

On shore\r\nthe luxuriant foliage of the trees betrays but here and there the hectic\r\nflush that portends the glories of the Indian summer. The islands, as\r\nemeralds in the setting of the sea, are a doubly welcome sight to eyes\r\nwhich for days past have seen nothing but the heaving billows of the broad\r\nAtlantic. Here and there, flecking with colour the sunlit scene, flutter\r\nthe Stars and Stripes. Far away in the West, faintly audible in the\r\ndistance, come the multitudinous sounds of the awakening seaport. The\r\ngreat Liner, which shuddered and throbbed for three thousand miles as it\r\nforged five hundred miles a day across the sea, is gliding smoothly and\r\nsoftly as a gondola towards the Venice of the Western World. Except when\r\napproaching the Golden Horn, no more beautiful scene greets the traveller\r\non approaching a great capital than that presented by the entrance to the\r\nharbour of New York. And right in the centre of the fair vision stands the\r\nBartholdi monument, with its gigantic figure hailing the pilgrims from the\r\nOlder World with the glad welcome of the New. What more appropriate\r\njanitress of the Land of Liberty?\r\n\r\nThe cynic may sneer that the analogy between the City of the Great\r\nAssassin and the City of the Boss extends further than the sea-gate to the\r\ncity. But to the millions whose eyes have rested hungrily upon the nearing\r\nland such reflections are unknown. To them the New World, of which New\r\nYork holds the keys, has ever been arrayed in the rainbow garment of Hope.\r\nNew York, merely as the portal of the continent, had long been to them as\r\na kind of New Jerusalem, let down from Heaven in mercy to hard-driven,\r\nhopeless men. From their earliest childhood they had heard of the great\r\nCommonwealth beyond the sea, where the blood-tax of the conscription was\r\nunknown, where all men were free and all men were equal, and where, in\r\nsolid, unmistakable reality, the dreams of the poets were found embodied\r\nin a Constitution that was at once the envy and despair of the world:--\r\n\r\n  There’s freedom at thy gates and rest\r\n  For earth’s downtrodden and oppressed;\r\n  A shelter for the hunted head,\r\n  For the starved labourer toil and bread;\r\n  Power at thy bounds\r\n  Stops, and calls back his baffled hounds.\r\n\r\nWhat wonder that the storm-tossed emigrant, as he first saw the city of\r\nNew York glimmering through the haze, felt the magic charm with which the\r\ntribes of Israel first gazed upon the confines of the Promised Land.\r\n\r\nTo the great mass of the English, Scottish, and Irish people--as\r\ndistinguished from the travelled and more or less cultured minority--the\r\nUnited States has for a hundred years been the land of their ideal, often\r\ndearer to them than their own. A very large section, possibly a majority,\r\nof our race has ever been more in sympathy with the people that was\r\nbelieved to have sprung from the loins of the men of the _Mayflower_ than\r\nwith the nation which recalled Charles the Second and still tolerates the\r\nascendency of the Establishment and the dominance of the landed\r\naristocracy. It is quite recently that this enthusiastic devotion to the\r\nAmerican Commonwealth has been somewhat dashed in Great Britain. It still\r\nexists in full force across the Irish Channel. To the Irishman the United\r\nStates is much more of a fatherland than the British Empire. We are,\r\nindeed, but a step-motherland to the Irishman, whereas in the United\r\nStates he is not merely at home, but in most of the cities he is at the\r\nhead of the household. But forty, thirty, and even twenty years ago it was\r\npractically the accepted creed of the English Radical that America led\r\nthe van, and whenever he was downcast and dispirited by the temporary\r\ntriumph of the Tories, he found consolation in the reflection that in the\r\ngreat Republic beyond the Atlantic a new and vigorous race was carrying\r\nout his ideals, free from the hateful clog of the hidebound Conservatism\r\nof the Old Country. No one can read the speeches of Bright and Cobden\r\nwithout feeling that it was on the Hudson and the Mississippi they found\r\ntheir spiritual fatherland, and the generation that sat at their feet\r\nlearned from them to regard America much as Walt Whitman painted it in his\r\nswinging dithyrambs in praise of “Liberty’s Nation.” We all more or less\r\nwere brought up to exult in the belief that--\r\n\r\n  America is the continent of the Glories, and of the triumph of Freedom,\r\n  And of the Democracies, and of the fruits of Society, and of all that\r\n        is begun.\r\n\r\nHence nothing more extravagant can be said in praise of New York Harbour\r\nthan that even to those nurtured on such pabulum it is no unworthy\r\napproach to the sea-gate of a new and better world.\r\n\r\nNor is it only the outside of the harbour that is most impressive. The\r\nHudson--that stately river compared with which the Rhine is but a muddy\r\ncreek, and the Thames a sluggish rivulet--is not less worthy of its _rôle_\r\nas the throne of the great city. It is impossible to exaggerate the\r\nimpression which the Hudson at night must produce on the peasant from the\r\nCarpathians or the labourer from Connemara. Even to those who have more\r\ntravelled eyes, and are not unfamiliar with seagirt citadels, the\r\nspectacle is superb. Never shall I forget my first impression of the\r\nmighty river.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if I had strayed to the entrance of faerie-land, or that,\r\nunawares, I had been transported to the sea-gate of some enchanted city.\r\nMidnight was near. In the sky overhead the stars gleamed, but they were\r\nfaint and speck-like, for the moon was shining unveiled by cloud. But it\r\nwas neither the lapping of the rippling water nor the silver sheen of the\r\nmoonlight on the wave that gave the scene its fascination of wonder. These\r\nthings are the universal poetry of Nature--the music of the waves and the\r\nmagic of the moon. And there is no speech or language where their voice is\r\nnot heard. But here there was something more. For on either side of the\r\nexpanse of water rose high banks of irregular outline, from whose rugged\r\nshadows gleamed the lights as of a myriad eyes:--\r\n\r\n  Behold the enchanted towers of Carbonek,\r\n  A castle like a rock upon a rock,\r\n  With chasm-like portals open to the sea,\r\n  And steps that met the breaker.\r\n\r\nUp and down either side, as far as you could see, until the dark outlines\r\nmerged in the distant horizon, these innumerable eyes looked out over\r\nthe water. Sometimes they winked, and now and then one or another would\r\nclose. It was as if each bank were guarded by some vast monster with a\r\nthousand times the eyes of him who watched the treasure of the Golden\r\nFleece.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OCEAN GATE OF THE NEW WORLD. A Misty Morning in New\r\nYork.]\r\n\r\nAnd behind the basilisk of the shore there rose, tier upon tier, the\r\nbuildings of the city, in which dwelt millions and millions of the\r\nchildren of men. Palaces and temples, brightly outlined in light or\r\ntowering dark against the luminous haze behind, pierced the sky-line.\r\nAmidst the vast confusion two lofty eminences stood out conspicuous,\r\ndominating the whole. One was a crown-like dome, poised in mid-air,\r\nshining resplendent with jewels of electric light; the other a lofty tower\r\ngirdled with a blazing zone of fire. Stars of flame shone on its summit,\r\nwhile ever and anon a beam of white light, quick and piercing as a\r\ntwo-edged sword, flashed like the brand of an archangel over the shadowy\r\ncity. And it was as it was written of old time, when our first parents,\r\nafter being cast out of Eden, looked back and saw “a flaming sword turning\r\nevery way to keep the way of the tree of life.” The sword was not of fire,\r\nbut of pure white light. Above and below it made darkness visibly black,\r\nbut revealed with startling distinctness everything on which it fell.\r\n\r\nThat was but the background, the framework of the picture. For the great\r\nscene was on the water. Never until at Spithead this midsummer, when six\r\nsquare miles of the Solent crowded with the warships of the world burst at\r\na signal into a glittering wilderness of lights, had I ever seen anything\r\nto compare to the Hudson at midnight. In Paris on the night of the fête of\r\nthe Republic in Exhibition year, when the Seine was crowded with steamers,\r\nall illuminated and decorated from stem to stern, there was something like\r\nthis. But the Seine was but a skein of silk stretched across the city; the\r\nwater was hidden by the craft. Here the whole expanse of waterway exceeded\r\neven that of the Neva at St. Petersburg; and, although full of life and\r\ncolour and sound, was nowhere crowded.\r\n\r\nImagine a great arm of the sea across which, between the two shores, were\r\nswiftly, ceaselessly gliding like silent faerie shuttles in some\r\nenchanter’s loom huge floating palaces, radiant from end to end with\r\ninnumerable lights. They moved with such strenuous rapidity that the\r\nwaters foamed beneath their keel, and the anchored vessels seemed to fly\r\npast as we left them behind. No great galleon of Spain illuminated in\r\nhonour of her patron saint ever shone more resplendent, and none ever\r\nmoved with half the fierce, resistless rush of these monsters of the\r\nriver. No sails had they or visible means of propulsion, they sped as if\r\nthought-impelled. Seldom had I seen anything more weirdly beautiful, or\r\nmore calculated to impress the imagination.\r\n\r\nNow and then a smaller palace would float down the stream, reviving, I\r\nknow not how, strange reminiscences of the great State barges in which the\r\nRinaldos of mediæval romance would be rowed to some high festival in\r\nArmida’s garden. Two starry lights overhead, as at the masthead--though\r\nmasts there were none--dimly revealed the contour below, where the light\r\nstreaming from serried windows produced a curious effect, as if banks of\r\nilluminated oars were speeding the galley on her way. And then again,\r\nsilent and slow, with but one light burning at her prow, a sombre\r\nmelancholy scow would drift across the moonlit waters--like\r\n\r\n                  the barge\r\n  Whereon the lily maid of Astolat\r\n  Lay smiling like a star on darkest night.\r\n\r\nOn sea and on shore it was one perpetual feast of lanterns. Mingled with\r\nthe golden and silver rays of the electric lights there shone everywhere\r\nlamps of ruby and of amethyst and of emerald, glowing like jewels of\r\nintense colour, set in a tiara of diamonds and pearls.\r\n\r\nAnd to add to the weirdness and mystery of the scene, ever and again there\r\nwould rise from the waters a strange melodious murmur, increasing in\r\nintensity to a wail, which would continue a minute and then die away as it\r\narose. It was like the plaintive lowing of sea-monsters for their lost or\r\nwandering calves. Otherwise all was still, save the lapping of the waves\r\non the shore.\r\n\r\n“And behold I saw,” said the seer of the Apocalypse, “as if it were a sea\r\nof glass mingled with fire. And lo----”\r\n\r\nIt was New York seen from a New Jersey ferry-boat on the Hudson, plying\r\nbetween 23rd Street and the Pennsylvania railway. Could there be a more\r\nsudden descent from the poetry of faerie-land to the vulgar prose of a\r\nwork-a-day world? The light-crowned dome was the office of the _World_\r\nnewspaper, the flashing beam from the tower the advertisement of a dry\r\ngoods store from Chicago. Yet, nevertheless, the effect of the reality, as\r\nit may be seen every fine night, far exceeds my poor description. To those\r\nwho have eyes to see it is one of the most wonderful and beautiful and\r\nsuggestive of scenes.\r\n\r\nSuch then is the outward and visible aspect of the Empire City, a city\r\nwhich from its situation is beautiful exceedingly, and which until quite\r\nrecently was regarded as the joy of the whole earth, and which still does\r\nhonour to the statue of such a martyr of Liberty as Nathan Hale. How it\r\nhas come to pass that the mighty has fallen, and the city which was once a\r\nname at the sound of which men renewed their hope and faith in the\r\nprogress of the world, has become a byword, a hissing and reproach, it\r\nwill be the object of this volume to explain. It is a subject in which we\r\nof the Old World have weighty reason to be interested. For we have\r\nsuffered a severe blow and a grievous discouragement in the betrayal of\r\nthe cause of Liberty in the very vestibule and entrance chamber of the\r\nRepublic. For all round the world the shame of New York darkens the sombre\r\nshade which encompasses the oppressed and gladdens with evil joy the heart\r\nof the oppressor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATUE OF NATHAN HALE. City Hall Park, New York.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GRIDIRON STREETS OF THE NOISY CITY. New York Post\r\nOffice, Broadway.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND CITY IN THE WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nA pandemonium of type-writing machines--of gigantic type-writing machines\r\ndriven by demons who never tire--in some vast hall of Eblis. The clank of\r\nthe type, the swish of the machine, the quick nervous ring of the bell,\r\nall indefinitely multiplied and magnified, fill the vast space with a\r\nreverberating clangour. This clangour continuously increases until its\r\nvery vibrations seem to become clotted and fill the air with a sound that\r\ncan be felt in every pore. It is like the pressure of an atmosphere so\r\ndense you can almost cut it with a knife, an atmosphere that is never\r\nstill, but perpetually frets, and moans, and snarls with feverish unrest.\r\n\r\nHow many machines there must be to crowd the air with this million times\r\nmultiplied misery of click and clang--ring-ring--ring-ring--and clang and\r\nclick, that never stops, but rises and falls, rhythmless and rude, like\r\nthe waves of a choppy sea on a rocky beach! Now and again through the\r\ninfernal hubbub there pierces a dreadful wail,\r\n\r\n  As it were, one voice in agony\r\n  Of lamentation, like a wind that shrills\r\n  All night in a waste land, where no one comes\r\n  Or hath come since the making of the world.\r\n\r\nHow hot the air is! a temperature of the antechamber of Tophet. As the\r\nperspiration bursts in great beads of moisture from your brow, you hear\r\nthe faint hum of circling wings, faint at first, but ever growing shriller\r\nand more acute--hiss, zip--as the invisible fiend circles round his\r\nprostrate victim. Hiss, zip, nearer, louder than before, audible clearly\r\neven above the metallic storm of the type-writing machines. And as the\r\nmosquito settles on your ear, you awake with a start and suddenly realise\r\nwhere you are.\r\n\r\nYou are not in even the outermost circles of Dante’s “Inferno.” You are\r\ntrying to sleep in the heart of Central New York, in the midst of all the\r\nthunder and the rush and the roar of her million-crowded streets, along\r\nwhich surges as a restless tide the turbid and foaming flood of city life.\r\nThe bells of the tramcars continually sounding, the weariless trampling of\r\nthe ironshod hoofs over granite roadway, the whirling rumble of the\r\nwheels, the roar of the trains which on the elevated railways radiate\r\nuproar from a kind of infernal firmament on high, all suffused and\r\nsubmerged in the murmurous hum that rises unceasing from the hurrying\r\nfootsteps in the crowded street, that inarticulate voice of New York--\r\n\r\n  Sad as the wail that from the populous earth\r\n  All day and night to high Olympus soars.\r\n\r\nAnd that dreadful shriek is the farewell of an Ocean liner sounding a\r\nsonorous note with stentorian lungs as it quits the wharf.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing like it in London. Chicago, with all its bustle, has\r\nnothing to compare to this harsh metallic clangour of struggle and\r\nstrife--although there the mournful death-tolling bell on the locomotives\r\nwhich thread the streets supplies a note of pathos and of awe that is\r\nmissing in the racket and roar of New York.\r\n\r\nOne grows used to it in time, just as after a few days you become used to\r\nthe thrust and swirl of the screw which drives the liner across the sea.\r\nThe great ship vibrates in every nerve of steel, and the state-room throbs\r\nwith the thud of the engines. So the great city pulses with strenuous\r\npower, and in the multitudinous uproar of its streets we hear the sound of\r\nthe friction of the two-million manpower engine which has made even Lesser\r\nNew York one of the greatest driving forces of the American Republic.\r\n\r\nIt is a dynamo of the first order. And like the dynamo it is instinct with\r\nmagnetic power. All great cities are great magnets, and New York is the\r\ngreatest--but one--in the world.\r\n\r\nThe figures of the portentous growth of cities in our epoch recall the\r\nfamiliar story in the “Arabian Nights Entertainments” of the vessel which,\r\nsailing too near the Loadstone Mountain, was whelmed into sudden\r\ndestruction. For the attraction of the loadstone was such that all the\r\niron nails in the vessel were drawn out of their fastenings, and the\r\ntimbers that were once a ship became mere flotsam and jetsam on the water.\r\nIt is a wild and romantic fable in the mouth of the Princess Scheherazade;\r\nbut it is grim reality in the world to-day. For the great city is to the\r\nrural population exactly what the Arabian loadstone mountain was to the\r\nheedless sailor who came within the range of its fascination. All the iron\r\nin the rural ship of State is attracted to the mighty Babylon. The men\r\nwith iron in their blood, the girls whose pulses leap and tingle with the\r\neager flush of adventure and ambition, desert the village and the farm to\r\ncrowd the roaring mart and glaring street. The country is denuded of its\r\nmost vigorous children. The city engulfs into its insatiate maw all those\r\nthe brightest, the bravest, and the best.\r\n\r\nThe process goes on at an ever accelerating ratio. As Mr. Godkin has well\r\nobserved:--\r\n\r\n    Parks and gardens, cheap concerts, free museums and art galleries,\r\n    cheap means of conveyance, model lodging-houses, rich charities, such\r\n    as every city is now offering in abundance to all comers, are so many\r\n    inducements to country poor to try their luck in the streets. They are\r\n    the exact equivalents, as an invitation to the lazy and the\r\n    pleasure-loving, of the Roman circus and free flour which we all use\r\n    in explanation of the decline and fall of the Empire. They are\r\n    luxuries which seem to be within every man’s reach gratis, and they\r\n    act with tremendous force on the rural imagination.--_North American\r\n    Review_, June, 1890.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of urban to the total population of the United States,\r\ndefining as urban all dwellers in cities of more than 8,000 population,\r\nwas 3·35 in 1790. Forty years later it had doubled. But in 1860 it was\r\n16·13, and in 1890, 29·12. But the growth of the cities which alone\r\ndeserve the name of great has been still more phenomenal. In 1840--not\r\nsixty years ago--the ten greatest cities of America contained a total\r\npopulation of 711,652. To-day Brooklyn alone, which has been merged as a\r\nkind of suburb in Greater New York, has a population of a million, while\r\nthe ten great cities, to be hereafter known as the Great Ten--New York,\r\nChicago, Philadelphia, Brooklyn, St. Louis, Boston, Baltimore, San\r\nFrancisco, Cincinnati, and Cleveland--had in 1890 a population of\r\n6,660,402, and will have in 1900 a population of eight millions. In fifty\r\nyears the population of the United States did not quadruple itself, for it\r\nonly expanded in round numbers from 17 millions to 62½ millions. But the\r\ngreat cities increased themselves nearly ten-fold in the same period, and\r\nto-day they contain 11 per cent. of the whole population of the Union. The\r\nlatest estimate of the present population of the country gives the cities\r\n25 millions out of the 72 million citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nIf one-third of the inhabitants of the American Commonwealth dwell in\r\ncities, these urban centres possess even more than one-third of the wealth\r\nof the nation, and far more than one-third of its actual power. A writer\r\nin one of the recent American magazines points out that the wealth of the\r\nGreat Ten in 1890 exceeded the wealth of the whole country, cities\r\nincluded, in 1850. The revenue of the same Great Ten amounted in 1890 to\r\n£25,000,000 per annum, a greater sum than was raised for State purposes in\r\nall the federated States and Territories. The annual Budget of New York\r\nand Brooklyn in 1890 dealt with ten millions sterling, a sum almost\r\nexactly equalling the Budget of the United States forty years ago.\r\n\r\nIt is now half a century since De Tocqueville wrote:--“I look upon the\r\nsize of certain American cities, and especially upon the nature of their\r\npopulation, as a real danger which threatens the security of the\r\nRepublic.” Since then this “real danger” has gone on increasing at an ever\r\naccelerating ratio. When De Tocqueville wrote, there were only three or\r\nfour cities with a population over 100,000. To-day there are thirty. And\r\nmost remarkable fact of all, the population of Greater New York is now\r\nequal in number to the total population of the United States at the time\r\nof the Declaration of Independence. Her 3,200,000 inhabitants exceed\r\nnearly four-fold the total number of the inhabitants in all the cities in\r\nthe States at the time De Tocqueville visited America. In the State of\r\nNew York, sixty per cent, of the inhabitants live in cities; in\r\nMassachusetts, seventy per cent.\r\n\r\nThis tendency townwards, which is one of the most striking characteristics\r\nof the English-speaking race all round the world, is nowhere more\r\nconspicuous than in the United States; and New York, of all American\r\ncities, is that where this centripetal law is just now seen to be\r\noperating most powerfully. In the amalgamation by which the Greater New\r\nYork has come into being we have the latest manifestation of the craving\r\non the part of all modern men to come together in ever-increasing\r\nagglomerations of humanity. The fissiparous tendency so perceptible in\r\npolitics is not visible in cities. There are numerous instances of two\r\ncities fusing into one; but no city having once achieved its unity splits\r\nit up. Amalgamation, not separation, is the order of the day. Where a\r\nriver does not divide--as for instance, in the case of Gateshead, that\r\n“long, narrow, dirty lane leading into Newcastle-on-Tyne,” or in the case\r\nof Salford--the larger town invariably swallows up its minor neighbours,\r\nas a large raindrop on the window-pane attracts the smaller drops in its\r\nimmediate vicinity. In the case of Greater New York, not even the dividing\r\nriver has been able to prevent the law of gravitation doing its will.\r\n\r\nThe City of New York is indeed seated upon rivers, and if State boundaries\r\nhad not stood in the way, there is little doubt that Jersey City would\r\nhave shared the fate of Brooklyn and Long Island. But even without Jersey\r\nCity, the new urban conglomerate will be the second city of the world in\r\npopulousness and greater even than London in area.\r\n\r\nThe City of New York has an area of 39 square miles, while the area of\r\nGreater New York is over 300 square miles. Brooklyn contains 29 square\r\nmiles, Staten Island comprises nearly 60 square miles, Westchester County\r\nannex has an area of about 20 square miles, and the Long Island townships\r\nincluded in the scheme have an aggregate extent of perhaps 170 miles.\r\n\r\nAt the first election for the Greater New York, held this year, no fewer\r\nthan 567,000 citizens were registered as electors in this colossal\r\nconstituency. The Greater New York charter divides the city into five\r\nboroughs. (1) Manhattan, consisting of the island of Manhattan, and the\r\noutlying islands naturally related to it. (2) The Bronx, including all\r\nthat part of the present City of New York lying north of the Harlem, a\r\nterritory which comprises two-thirds of the area of the present City of\r\nNew York. (3) Brooklyn. (4) Queen’s, consisting of that portion of Queen’s\r\nCounty which is incorporated into the Greater New York. (5) Richmond; that\r\nis, Staten Island. The population of the City of New York which before the\r\namalgamation was close on 2,000,000, is now swollen to 3,200,000, of whom\r\nnearly 2,000,000 live in tenement houses.\r\n\r\nThe size of New York is by no means its most notable distinction. Chicago\r\nsome day may, by right of its more central position, win the prize of\r\nbeing recognised as the real if not the political capital of the United\r\nStates. But the position to which Chicago aspires has, for nearly a\r\ncentury, been held by New York. For New York is one of the few cities in\r\nthe States which are not of yesterday. Of course, compared with London,\r\nwhich dates back to the Cæsars, New York is but a mushroom upstart. But as\r\nin the realm of the blind the one-eyed man is king, so in the New World a\r\ncity which can count its history by centuries may be regarded as\r\npossessing quite a respectable antiquity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of GREATER NEW YORK.]\r\n\r\nTo us in the Old World it is the window through which we look into\r\nAmerica. Peter the Great built his capital on the Neva in order to have a\r\nwindow from which he could look into Europe. New York serves much the same\r\npurpose. It is through the window-pane of New York that the Old World sees\r\nwhat little it does see that is going on in the American Republic. All the\r\nnewspaper correspondents of the European press without a single exception,\r\nso far as I know, cable from New York. Not a single British newspaper has\r\na correspondent at Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, or Washington. As for\r\nthe suggestion of publishing telegrams from New Orleans or San Francisco,\r\nit would be more reasonable to expect to see despatches from Mars. This\r\nleads, no doubt, to much misconception. The New York window is by no means\r\nof transparent crystal. Those who consent to see the United States solely\r\nthrough their New York window-pane will often be egregiously misled.\r\nNevertheless, the fact remains that New York is the only window through\r\nwhich the Old World peeps into the New.\r\n\r\nNor is that the only special reason why New York is better known to us of\r\nthe older branch of the race than any other part of the American\r\nContinent. New York is not more the only window than it is the only door\r\nof the New World. The Atlantic is furrowed by a thousand keels, but all\r\nthe liners steer for New York. Steamers no doubt ply to Boston and to\r\nPhiladelphia, but the great trade route--the only passenger route--lies\r\npast Sandy Hook. New York is the front gate of the Western hemisphere.\r\nEven Canada finds it more convenient to use the New York entrance than the\r\nice-blocked mouth of the St. Lawrence. Hence, whatever else the Old World\r\nman may see or fail to see in the New World, the one place he is certain\r\nto see, the one place which he cannot avoid seeing, is the Queen of the\r\nHudson.\r\n\r\nAnd as New York is the first American city which every traveller sees, and\r\nthe last which he leaves, so New York has attracted a greater number of\r\nEuropean residents than any other city, with the doubtful exception of\r\nChicago. In 1888, thirty-six per cent. of the citizens were either Irish\r\nor of Irish descent. The German element was in 1891 estimated at\r\ntwenty-five per cent. In the City of New York the indigenous American only\r\nnumbers twenty per cent.\r\n\r\nBut it is not its imported population which makes it so peculiarly\r\nEuropean. Chicago is at least as cosmopolitan, but the city on Lake\r\nMichigan counts herself much more American than her sister on the Hudson.\r\nDuring the last Presidential Campaign New York was constantly singled out\r\nfor attack by the Bryanite orators of the West and South as if it were a\r\nforeign and hostile colony encamped on American soil. Wall Street, the\r\ncentre of the financial system of the United States, was as sound on the\r\ncurrency question as the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street, and the\r\nadvocates of Free Silver confounded New York and London alike beneath\r\ntheir savage anathema. Community of interest begets community of ideas,\r\nand the Western men angrily declare that New York is no more a typical\r\nAmerican city than London or Liverpool. This is an exaggeration, no doubt.\r\nBut neighbourhood counts for something, and New York is a thousand miles\r\nnearer to London than to Chicago.\r\n\r\nNew York is only six days’ steaming from Europe. It is the centre from\r\nwhence the mighty shuttles ply back and forth across the Atlantic,\r\nweaving the ocean-sundered sections of our race into one. Of the threads,\r\nsome end at Southampton and others at Liverpool. But they all start from\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE WINDOW-PANES OF THE WINDOW OF THE NEW WORLD.\r\nPrinting-House Square, New York.]\r\n\r\nThere is another distinctive element about New York. It is the great\r\nliterary producing-centre of the American people. Boston has long since\r\nbeen dethroned. No other city has even ventured to contest the primacy of\r\nNew York. There is not a single magazine printed in America that has any\r\ncirculation outside the United States which is not edited, printed, and\r\npublished in New York. The advantages of a more central position enjoyed\r\nby Chicago are as nought compared with those which New York enjoys in\r\nother ways. When I proposed to publish the American _Review of Reviews_ in\r\nChicago, I was promptly silenced by the statement that with the exception\r\nof the _Ladies’ Home Journal_ there was not a single periodical published\r\noutside New York which could claim to have achieved a success. New York,\r\nfrom the publishing point of view, is the hub of the American universe.\r\nHer magazines, admirably edited and marvellously illustrated, circulate in\r\nevery nook and corner of the English-speaking world. The magazines of the\r\nother cities are virtually unknown outside the Republic, and often, it may\r\nbe said, outside the city that gives them birth. New York, then, as the\r\nwindow and front door of the United States, with an unchallenged\r\nfinancial, commercial, shipping and literary ascendency, has the pull over\r\nall her rivals. To nine-tenths of mankind New York is America. All the\r\nrest of the country is but the pedestal upon which New York stands.\r\n\r\nThis pre-eminent position carries with it a grave responsibility. If the\r\nworld at large judges the American Commonwealth by New York, then New York\r\nowes a double duty both to the American Commonwealth and to the world at\r\nlarge. Hence the extreme interest which the latest evolution in the civic\r\ndevelopment of New York naturally arouses. This Greater New York--what\r\ndoes it mean? How did it come into being? What were the issues at stake at\r\nthe late Election? All these questions every one is asking. I propose to\r\nattempt to supply some answer.\r\n\r\nIt is a task of some difficulty and no little importance; for not merely\r\nis New York--rightly or wrongly--regarded as the most typical and best\r\nknown American city, but the United States tends more and more to become\r\nnot a federation of States and territories, but an association of huge\r\ncities. The Great Ten not merely include within their boundaries nearly\r\neight million persons, or more than ten per cent. of the whole population;\r\nthey do the thinking and the guiding and the managing of a very large\r\nproportion of the remaining nine-tenths. Draw a circle with a\r\nthree-hundred-mile radius round the Great Ten, and you inclose an area\r\nwhich is practically dominated by the Ten and educated by their\r\nnewspapers. The Newspaper Area is a phrase not yet naturalised in\r\ngeographies, but it is the most real and living area of all those into\r\nwhich the social organism is divided. For the newspaper collects its news\r\nevery day, and sells its news every morning and evening, thereby creating\r\na living, ever-renewed bond between the dwellers within the radius of its\r\ncirculation infinitely superior to the nexus supplied by the tax-collector\r\nand the policeman. It is not difficult to define the length of the range\r\nwithin which a newspaper can create a constituency. It is rigidly limited\r\nby the distance from the printing-office in which a newspaper can be\r\ndelivered before breakfast. After breakfast the influence of the newspaper\r\ndwindles every minute. Any one living so far off as not to be able to\r\nobtain his newspaper before dinner is practically outside the\r\npale--unless, of course, he lives remote from any local centre of news\r\ndistribution. In that case the range of influence is almost indefinite, as\r\nis shown to this day in the hold which the weekly _New York Tribune_\r\nexercises over farmers scattered everywhere between the Atlantic and the\r\nRocky Mountains. But speaking generally, the range of the Newspaper Area\r\nis limited by breakfast-time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FRONT DOOR OF THE NEW WORLD.]\r\n\r\nGreater New York has come into being in order to increase, not to\r\ndiminish, the influence of New York in the Republic and in the world at\r\nlarge. This influence may be for evil. “Under the new charter,” says Mr.\r\nW. C. De Witt, Chairman of the Committee which drafted that document, “the\r\nCity of New York at one bound becomes the mistress of the Western\r\nhemisphere and the second city of the world. It should be to its people\r\nwhat Athens was to the Greek, Rome to the Romans, Florence to the\r\nFlorentine--an object of constant solicitude and of civic pride.”\r\n\r\nThe question whether they intend to obey the voice of their friendly\r\nmentor is one on which the future fortune of the American Commonwealth\r\nwill largely depend. For, as Mr. J. C. Adams pointed out in a thoughtful\r\narticle on “The Municipal Threat in National Politics,” which he\r\ncontributed to the _New England Magazine_ in July, 1891:--\r\n\r\n    The misgovernment of the cities is the prophecy of misgovernment of\r\n    the nation; just as the paralysis of the great nerve-centres means the\r\n    palsy of the whole body. There is graver danger to the republic in the\r\n    failure of good government in our cities than arises from the moral\r\n    corruption which accompanies that failure. The misgovernment of our\r\n    cities means the break-down of one of the two fundamental principles\r\n    upon which our political fabric rests. It is the failure of local\r\n    self-government in a most vital part. It is as great a peril to the\r\n    republic as the revolt against the Union. For the republic is\r\n    organised upon two great political ideas, both essential to its\r\n    existence. The first is the principle of federation, which is embodied\r\n    in the Union; the second is the principle of local self-government,\r\n    which places the business of the states and the towns in the hands of\r\n    the people who live in them. Both of these are vital principles. The\r\n    republic has survived the attempt to subvert one of them. It has just\r\n    entered on its real struggle with a serious attack upon the other.\r\n\r\nThe fate, therefore, of the American Republic may be bound up with the\r\nfortunes of Greater New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nST. TAMMANY AND THE DEVIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto, the city government of New York has not been a credit to the\r\nRepublic; otherwise I should not be publishing a survey of the way in\r\nwhich New York has been governed as “Satan’s Invisible World Displayed.”\r\nThe title, of course, is an adaptation, not an invention. The original\r\nholder of the copyright was one Hopkins, of the seventeenth century, who,\r\nhaving had much experience in the discovery of witches, deemed himself an\r\nexpert qualified to describe the inner history and secret mystery of the\r\ninfernal regions under that picturesque title. I have adopted it as being\r\non the whole the most appropriate description of the state of abysmal\r\nabomination into which the government of New York had sunk before the\r\ngreat revolt of 1894 broke the power of Tammany--for a season--and placed\r\nin office a Reform Government charged to cleanse the Augean stable. The\r\nold witchfinder had no story to tell so horrible or so incredible as that\r\nwhich I have drawn up from the sworn evidence of witnesses exposed to\r\npublic cross-examination before a State Commission in the City of New\r\nYork. In the reports of the infernal Sabbats, for attending which\r\nthousands of old women were burnt or hanged in the seventeenth century,\r\nthere always figures in the background, as the central figure in the\r\nhorrid drama, a form but half-revealed, concerning whose identity even the\r\nwitchfinders speak with awe. The weird women, with their incantations and\r\ntheir broomsticks, their magic spells and their diabolical trysts, are but\r\nthe slaves of the Demon, who, whether as their lover or their torturer, is\r\never their master, whose name they whisper with fear, and whose commands\r\nthey obey with instant alacrity. For the Master of Ceremonies in the\r\nInfernal revels, the Lord of the Witches’ Sabbat, is none other than Satan\r\nhimself, the incarnate principle of Evil, the Boss of Hell!\r\n\r\nIn the modern world, sceptical and superstitious, these tales of witches\r\nand warlocks seem childish nonsense, unworthy of the attention of grown-up\r\nmen. But although the _dramatis personæ_ have changed, and the\r\n_mise-en-scène_, the same phenomena reappear eternally. Here in the\r\nhistory of New York we have the whole infernal phantasmagoria once again,\r\nwith heelers for witches, policemen as wizards, and secret sessions in\r\nTammany Hall as the Witches’ Sabbat of the new era. And behind them all,\r\nalways present but dimly seen--the omnipresent central force, whose name\r\nis muttered with awe, and whose mandate is obeyed with speed--is the same\r\nsombre figure whom his devotees regard with passionate worship, and whom\r\nhis enemies dread even as they curse his name. And this modern\r\nSathanas--this man who to every good Republican is the most authentic\r\nincarnation of the principle of Evil, the veritable archfiend of the\r\npolitical world--is the Boss of Tammany Hall.\r\n\r\nAmong the many legends which have clustered round the beginning of the\r\ngreat association which has played so conspicuous a part in the history of\r\nNew York, there is one which appeals specially to the sense of humour.\r\nTammany, according to tradition, was the name of a Delaware Indian who in\r\nancient days belonged to a Redskin confederacy that inhabited the regions\r\nnow known as New Jersey and Pennsylvania. His name has been variously\r\nspelled as Temane, Tamanend, Taminent, Tameny, and Tammany.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, by a kind of metamorphosis by no means without precedent\r\namong more historical saints, his name has been attached to a locality\r\nwhich he probably never visited, and with the inhabitants of which he and\r\nhis people lived in hereditary feud. This was not, however, due to any of\r\nhis conflicts with the Mohicans, who in those days pitched their wigwams\r\non the island of Manhattan. He owes it to a battle which he fought with no\r\nless a personage than the great enemy of mankind. In the days when St.\r\nTammany, passed his legendary existence, there were no white men on the\r\nAmerican Continent; but although the Pale-Face was absent, the Black man\r\nwas in full force, and one fine day St. Tammany was exposed to the fell\r\nonslaught of the foul fiend. At first, as is his wont, the bad spirit,\r\nwith honeyed words, sought to be admitted to a share in the government of\r\nTammany’s realm.\r\n\r\n“Get thee behind me, Satan!” rendered in the choicest Delaware dialect,\r\nwas the Saint’s response to the offers of the tempter. But as a more\r\nillustrious case attests, the Devil is not a person who will accept a\r\nfirst refusal. Changing his tactics, he brought upon St. Tammany and his\r\nDelawares many grievous afflictions of body and of estate, and while the\r\ngood Chief’s limbs were sore and his heart was heavy, the cunning deceiver\r\nattempted to slink into the country unawares.\r\n\r\nSt. Tammany, however, although sick and sore, slept with one eye open, and\r\nthe Devil was promptly ordered to “get out of that,” with an emphasis\r\nwhich left him no option but to obey. Again and again the Devil, renewing\r\nhis attacks, tried his best to circumvent St. Tammany, but finding that\r\nall was in vain, he at last flung patience and strategy to the winds, and\r\nboldly attacked the great Sagamore in order to overwhelm him by his\r\ninfernal might.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNION SQUARE, NEW YORK, WITH THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT.]\r\n\r\nThen, says the legend, ensued the most tremendous battle that has ever\r\nbeen waged between man and his great enemy. For many months the great\r\nfight went on, and as Tammany and the Devil wrestled to and fro in mortal\r\ncombat, whole forests were broken down, and the ground was so effectually\r\ntrampled under foot that it has remained prairie land to this day. At\r\nlast, after the forests had been destroyed, and the country trodden flat,\r\nSt. Tammany, catching his adversary unawares, tripped him up, and hurled\r\nhim to the ground. It was in the nick of time, for Tammany was so\r\nexhausted with the prolonged struggle that when he drew his scalping-knife\r\nto make a final end of the Evil One, the fiend, to the eternal regret of\r\nall the children of men, succeeded in slipping from Tammany’s clutches. He\r\nescaped across the river to New York, where--so runs the legend, as it is\r\nrecorded by a writer in _Harper_--“he was hospitably received by the\r\nnatives, and has ever since continued to make his home.”\r\n\r\nSuch, in the quaint but suggestive narrative of the ancient myth, is the\r\nway in which the Devil first came to New York, where, as if in revenge for\r\nhis defeat, he seems to have christened the political organisation which\r\nhas been his headquarters after the name of Tammany.\r\n\r\nThe Tammany organisation did not in the beginning take its rise in New\r\nYork. It first sprang into being in the ranks of the revolutionary army of\r\nPennsylvania. Tammany, or Tamanend, as he was then called, was adopted by\r\nthe Pennsylvanian troops under General Washington as their patron saint.\r\nThere were two reasons for this. In the first place, it was Hobson’s\r\nchoice, for St. Tammany was the only native American who had ever been\r\ncanonised; and, in the second place, nothing seemed more appropriate to\r\nthe revolutionary heroes than to adopt as their patron saint a brave who\r\nhad “whipped the Devil.” St. Tammany, therefore, came to be adopted by the\r\nAmerican army as a kind of counterpart to our own St. George. St. Tammany\r\nand the Devil seemed to be a good counterpoise to the legendary tale of\r\nSt. George and the Dragon. The 12th of May was Tammany’s Saint’s Day, and\r\nwas celebrated with wigwams, liberty poles, tomahawks, and all the regular\r\nparaphernalia of the Redskin. A soldier attired in Indian costume\r\nrepresented the great Sachem, “and, after delivering a talk full of\r\neloquence for law and liberty and courage in battle to the members of the\r\norder, they danced with feathers in their caps and buck tails dangling on\r\nbehind.” The practice spread from the Pennsylvania troops to the rest of\r\nthe army, and so popular did Tammany become that May 12th bid fair to be\r\nmuch more a popular national festival than July 4th.\r\n\r\nIt was not until this century had begun that the Tammany Society was\r\ndomiciled in New York. It was introduced there by an upholsterer of Irish\r\ndescent, named William Mooney. He did not take much stock in St. Tammany,\r\nbut preferred to call his Society the Columbian Order, in honour of\r\nColumbus. The transactions of the Society dated from the discovery of\r\nAmerica. Besides the European head, who was to be known as the Great\r\nFather, there were to be twelve Sachems, or counsellors--“Old Men” being\r\nthe Indian signification of the word; a Sagamore, or master of ceremonies;\r\na Wiskinkie, or doorkeeper of the sacred wigwam; and a Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe Society from its outset appears to have been political, but in its\r\nearly days it combined charity with politics. In the second year of its\r\nexistence it undertook the establishment of a Museum of Natural History,\r\nand got together the exhibits which formed the nucleus of Barnum’s famous\r\nmuseum. It was a social and convivial club, which met first in a hotel of\r\nBroadway, then in a public-house in Broad Street, and finally in the\r\nPig-pen, a long room attached to a saloon kept by one Martling. In 1811 it\r\nerected a hall of its own. Its present address is “Tammany Hall,\r\nFourteenth Street.”\r\n\r\nThere is no necessity to do more than glance at the curious beginnings of\r\na society which is perhaps the most distinctively American of all the\r\nassociations that have ever been founded in the New World. A writer of\r\n“The Story of Tammany,” which appeared in _Harper’s Magazine_ many years\r\nago, from which most of these facts are taken, says:--\r\n\r\n    The Tammany Society, or Columbian Order, is doubtless the oldest\r\n    purely self-constituted political association in the world, and has\r\n    certainly been by far the most influential. Beginning with the\r\n    government, for it was organised within a fortnight of the\r\n    inauguration of the first President, and at a spot within the sound of\r\n    his voice as he spoke his first official words to his countrymen, it\r\n    has not only continued down to the present time--through nearly three\r\n    generations of men--but has controlled the choice of at least one\r\n    President, fixed the character of several national as well as State\r\n    administrations, given pseudonyms to half a dozen well-known\r\n    organisations, and, in fact, has shaped the destiny of the country in\r\n    several turning-points of its history.\r\n\r\n    Few suspect, much less comprehend, the extent of the influence this\r\n    purely local association has exerted. To its agency more than any\r\n    other is due the fact that for the last three-quarters of a century\r\n    New York city has been the most potent political centre in the world,\r\n    not even Paris excepted. Greater than a party, inasmuch as it has been\r\n    the master of parties, it has seen political organisation after\r\n    organisation, in whose conflicts it has fearlessly participated,\r\n    arise, flourish, and go down, and yet has stood ready, with powers\r\n    unimpaired, to engage in the struggles of the next crop of\r\n    contestants. In this experience it has been solitary and peculiar.\r\n    Imitators it has had in abundance, but not one of them has succeeded\r\n    in catching that secret of political management which has endowed\r\n    Tammany with its wonderful permanency.\r\n\r\n    What is that secret? It is unquestionably to be traced, in part, to\r\n    the sagacity which Tammany’s leaders have at all times shown in\r\n    forecasting the changes of political issues, or availing themselves of\r\n    the opportunities afforded by current events as they have arisen.\r\n    Tammany has not only furnished the most capable politicians the\r\n    country has possessed, but has managed to ally itself with the\r\n    shrewdest ones to be found outside of its own organisation. It has\r\n    always shown a willingness to trade in the gifts at its command, and\r\n    rarely indeed has it got the worst of a bargain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST TAMMANY HALL, ERECTED 1811.]\r\n\r\nThe writer in _Harper_, however, while attempting to explain the secret of\r\nTammany, only raises a still more difficult question. How is it that\r\nTammany should have been able to discern the signs of the times better\r\nthan its rivals? How is it that Tammany has been able to furnish the most\r\ncapable politicians the country has ever possessed, and how is it that it\r\nhas displayed so much wisdom? There is one explanation, which, no doubt,\r\ncommends itself to many of those who have spent their life in fighting\r\nTammany Hall. Tammany has little regard for the innocence of the dove, but\r\nit has always displayed the wisdom of the serpent. Considering the place\r\nwhere the Author of all Evil found refuge after his discomfiture by St.\r\nTammany, a Republican may be pardoned for suggesting that the wisdom of\r\nTammany is due to the wisdom of the Old Serpent. Certainly, many innocent\r\npersons have been accused of dalliance with the foul fiend on much worse\r\n_primâ facie_ evidence than that which is furnished by the universal\r\nadmission that Tammany, out of the most uncompromising materials, has\r\nsucceeded in achieving exploits which antecedently would have been\r\nabsolutely impossible. For Tammany, although preserving and maintaining\r\nfrom first to last a discipline which is the despair of all the other\r\npolitical machines in the country, has never been without fierce\r\ninternecine fights. It has cast out leader after leader, and the ferocity\r\nof the feuds within Tammany has exceeded that of any of the combats which\r\nhave been waged against the common enemy. Nevertheless, notwithstanding\r\nall schisms, all reverses, all exposures, Tammany remains to this day the\r\nstrongest, the best disciplined, and the most feared political\r\norganisation in the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAMMANY HALL, OPENED 1860.]\r\n\r\nMr. Croker, in the series of interviews which I reported in the October\r\nnumber of the REVIEW OF REVIEWS, argued with much force and plausibility\r\nthat it was contrary to the law of human nature that an organisation could\r\nlive and last so long if it were composed of Thugs and desperados, and\r\nthat witness no doubt is true. Even so stout and stalwart an opponent of\r\nTammany as Dr. Albert Shaw has frequently felt himself constrained to\r\nadmit that the insane fashion in which New York has been governed rendered\r\neven the rule of Tammany preferable to the constitutional and legal chaos\r\nwhich was the only substitute. Dr. Shaw, speaking of the system under\r\nwhich New York has hitherto been governed, said:--\r\n\r\n    To know its ins and outs is not so much like knowing the parts and the\r\n    workings of a finely adjusted machine as it is like knowing the\r\n    obscure topography of the great Dismal Swamp considered as a place of\r\n    refuge for criminals.\r\n\r\nAgain he wrote:--\r\n\r\n    In New York, the absurdly disjointed and hopelessly complex array of\r\n    separate boards, functions, and administrative powers, first makes it\r\n    impossible for the community to focalise responsibility anywhere in\r\n    the formal mechanism of municipal government, and then makes it\r\n    possible for an irresponsible self-centred political and mercenary\r\n    society like Tammany to gain for itself the real control, and thus to\r\n    assume a domination that ought to be centred in some body or\r\n    functionary directly accountable to the people. Government by a secret\r\n    society like Tammany is better than the chaos of a disjointed\r\n    government for which there can be no possible location of central\r\n    responsibility.\r\n\r\nIt is not for me to dogmatise where experts, native to New York,\r\nhopelessly disagree. But viewed from the outside the secret of Tammany’s\r\nsuccess seems to lie chiefly in the fact that Tammany has from the first\r\nbeen really a democratic organisation. No one was too poor, too wicked, or\r\ntoo ignorant to be treated by Tammany as a man and a brother if he would\r\nstand in with the machine and join the brotherhood.\r\n\r\nThis secret of Tammany--the open secret--was explained to me in Chicago by\r\na saloon-keeper of more than dubious morals who had been a Tammany captain\r\nin New York. I saw him the night after Dr. Parkhurst had scored his first\r\ngreat success over the politicians of New York. The ex-Tammany Captain\r\nshook his head when I asked him what he thought of Dr. Parkhurst’s\r\ncampaign. He had no use for Dr. Parkhurst. For a time, he thought, he\r\nmight advertise himself, which was no doubt his object, but after that\r\neverything would go on as before. The one permanent institution in New\r\nYork was Tammany.\r\n\r\nI asked him to explain his secret. “Suppose,” said I, “that I am a newly\r\narrived citizen in your precinct, and come to you and wish to join\r\nTammany, what would be required of me?”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said he, “before anything would be required of you we would find\r\nout all about you. I would size you up myself, and then after I had formed\r\nmy own judgment I would send two or three trusty men to find out all about\r\nyou. Find out, for instance, whether you really meant to work and serve\r\nTammany, or whether you were only getting in to find out all about it. If\r\nthe inquiries were satisfactory then you would be admitted to the ranks of\r\nTammany, and you would stand in with the rest.”\r\n\r\n“What should I have to do?”\r\n\r\n“Your first duty,” said he, “would be to vote the Tammany ticket whenever\r\nan election was on, and then to hustle around and make every other person\r\nwhom you could get hold of vote the same ticket.”\r\n\r\n“And what would I get for my trouble?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” said he, “unless you needed it. I was twenty years captain and\r\nI never got anything for myself, but if you needed anything you would get\r\nwhatever was going. It might be a job that would give you employment under\r\nthe city, it might be a pull that you might have with the alderman in case\r\nyou got into trouble, whatever it was you would be entitled to your share.\r\nIf you get into trouble, Tammany will help you out. If you are out of a\r\njob Tammany will see that you have the first chance of whatever is going.\r\nIt is a great power, is Tammany. Whether it is with the police, or in the\r\ncourt, or in the City Hall, you will find Tammany men everywhere, and they\r\nall stick together. There is nothing sticks so tight as Tammany.”\r\n\r\nTherein, no doubt, this worthy ex-captain revealed the great secret, of\r\nTammany’s success. Tammany is a brotherhood. Tammany men stick together,\r\nand help each other.\r\n\r\nThe record of Tammany, however, hardly bears out the claim made for it by\r\nMr. Croker as to the honesty and purity of its administration. From its\r\nvery early days Tammany has had a bad record for dishonesty and utter lack\r\nof scruple. As early as 1837, two Tammany leaders, who had held the\r\nfederal offices of Collector of the Port of New York, and of United States\r\nDistrict Attorney for the Southern district of New York, skipped to Europe\r\nafter embezzling, the one £250,000, the other £15,000. About twenty years\r\nlater, another Tammany leader, who was appointed Postmaster for New York,\r\nadvanced £50,000 of post-office money in order to carry Pennsylvania for\r\nBuchanan. These, however, were but bagatelles compared with the carnival\r\nof plunder which was established when Tweed was Tammany Boss.\r\n\r\nIt was not until about the middle of the century that Tammany laid the\r\nhand upon the agency which for nearly fifty years has been the sceptre of\r\nits power. A certain Southerner, rejoicing in the name of Rynders, who was\r\na leading man in Tammany in the Forties, organised as a kind of affiliated\r\ninstitution the Empire Club, whose members were too disreputable even for\r\nTammany. These men, largely composed of roughs and rowdies, who rejoiced\r\nin the expressive title of the Bowery Plug Uglies, were the first to lay\r\ntheir hand upon the immigrant and utilise him for the purpose of carrying\r\nelections. Mr. Edwards, writing in _McClure’s Magazine_, says:--\r\n\r\n    It was the Empire Club, indeed, which taught the political value of\r\n    the newly-arrived foreigner. Its members approached the immigrants at\r\n    the piers on the arrival of every steamship or packet; conducted them\r\n    into congenial districts; found them employment in the city works, or\r\n    perhaps helped them to set up in business as keepers of grog-shops.\r\n\r\n“Politics in Louisiana,” General Grant is reported to have said on one\r\noccasion, “are Hell.” They seem to have been very much like hell in the\r\ndays when the Plug Uglies with Rynders at their head ruled the roast at\r\nTammany. Mr. Edwards tells a story which sheds a lurid ray of light on the\r\nman and manners of that time. Mr. Godwin, who preceded Mr. Godkin in the\r\nincessant warfare which the _Evening Post_ has waged against Tammany, had\r\ngiven more than usual offence to Rynders. That worthy, therefore, decided\r\nto assassinate the editor as he was taking his lunch at the hotel. Mike\r\nWalsh, however, a plucky Irishman, interfered, and enabled Godwin to make\r\nhis escape. When the intended victim had gone out--\r\n\r\n    Rynders stepped up to Walsh and said: “What do you mean by interfering\r\n    in this matter? It is none of your affair.”\r\n\r\n    “Well, Godwin did me a good turn once, and I don’t propose to see him\r\n    stabbed in the back. You were going to do a sneaking thing; you were\r\n    going to assassinate him, and any man who will do that is a coward.”\r\n\r\n    “No man ever called me a coward, Mike Walsh, and you can’t.”\r\n\r\n    “But I do, and I will prove that you are a coward. If you are not one,\r\n    come upstairs with me now. We will lock ourselves into a room; I will\r\n    take a knife and you take one; and the man who is alive after we have\r\n    got through, will unlock the door and go out.”\r\n\r\n    Rynders accepted the challenge. They went to an upper room. Walsh\r\n    locked the door, gave Rynders a large bowie-knife, took one himself,\r\n    and said: “You stand in that corner, and I’ll stand in this. Then we\r\n    will walk towards the centre of the room, and we won’t stop until one\r\n    or the other of us is finished.”\r\n\r\n    Each took his corner. Then Walsh turned and approached the centre of\r\n    the room. But Rynders did not stir. “Why don’t you come out?” said\r\n    Walsh. Rynders, turning in his corner, faced his antagonist, and said:\r\n    “Mike, you and I have always been friends; what is the use of our\r\n    fighting now? If we get at it, we shall both be killed, and there is\r\n    no good in that.” Walsh for a moment said not a word; but his lip\r\n    curled, and he looked upon Rynders with an expression of utter\r\n    contempt. Then he said: “I told you you were a coward, and now I prove\r\n    it. Never speak to me again.”\r\n\r\nMike Walsh, the hero of this episode of the bowie-knife, is notable as\r\nhaving been the first man to publicly accuse Tammany of tampering with the\r\nballot-box. He was not the last by any means; but Tammany seems to have\r\nbegun well, for, says Mr. Edwards:--\r\n\r\n    Roscoe Conkling once said, chatting with a group of friends, that\r\n    Governor Seward had told him that the Tammany frauds committed by the\r\n    Empire Club in New York City in 1844 unquestionably gave Polk the\r\n    meagre majority of five thousand which he obtained in New York State,\r\n    and by which he was brought to the Presidency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FERNANDO WOOD.]\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that with this beginning things went on from bad to\r\nworse until Mike Walsh, a few years before the War, publicly declared in a\r\ngreat Democratic meeting in the city:--\r\n\r\n    “I tell you now, and I say it boldly, that in this body politic of New\r\n    York there is not political or personal honesty enough left to drive a\r\n    nail into to hang a hat upon.”\r\n\r\nThere is a fine picturesqueness about this phrase which enables it to\r\nstick like a burr to the memory. It was not, however, until the Irish\r\nemigration began in good earnest that Tammany found its vocation. Fernando\r\nWood was first elected to the Mayoralty in 1854. Fernando Wood was a ward\r\npolitician who first became known to the public by a prosecution in which\r\nit was proved that he had cheated his partner by altering the figures in\r\naccounts. He did not deny the charge, but pleaded statutory limitation.\r\nHaving thus succeeded in avoiding gaol, he promptly ran for the Mayoralty,\r\nand was duly elected. With him came what Mr. Godkin calls “the\r\norganisation of New York politics on a criminal basis.” The exploits of\r\nFernando Wood, however, were thrown entirely into the shade by the lurid\r\nsplendour of his successor.\r\n\r\nThis was William M. Tweed, the famous “Boss” Tweed, who began his life as\r\na journeyman, and ended it in Ludley Street Gaol, after having ruled New\r\nYork for years, as if he were a Turkish Pasha. After serving\r\napprenticeship as a Member of the New York Senate, Deputy Street\r\nCommissioner, and President of the Board of Supervisors, he gradually made\r\nhis way upwards until he was recognised as Boss of Tammany. It was not,\r\nhowever, until the year 1868 that he succeeded in giving the public a true\r\ntaste of his quality. Even hardened Tammany politicians were aghast at the\r\ncolossal frauds which he practised at the polls--frauds not only unique in\r\ntheir dimensions, but in the exceeding variety and multiplicity of their\r\nmethods. On January 1st, 1869, Tweed and his allies began to plunder the\r\ncity in a fashion which might have made the mouth of a Roman proconsul\r\nwater. His ally, Connolly, was made Comptroller, while Tweed himself found\r\nample scope for his fraudulent genius in the posts of Deputy Street\r\nCommissioner and Supervisor. In the first year he issued fraudulent\r\nwarrants for £750,000. The money was spent fast and furiously. Tweed was a\r\nfellow of infinite variety, and he seemed almost to revel in the diversity\r\nof methods by which he could plunder the public. One very ingenious and\r\nsimple fraud was his securing an Act of the Legislature, making a little\r\npaper which he owned the official organ of the City Government. In that\r\ncapacity he drew £200,000 a year from the rates and taxes, as compensation\r\nfor printing the report of the proceedings of the Common Council. Mr.\r\nEdwards says:--\r\n\r\n    He established a printing company, whose main business was the\r\n    printing of blank forms and vouchers, for which in one year two\r\n    million eight hundred thousand dollars was charged. Another item was a\r\n    stationer’s company, which furnished all the stationery used in the\r\n    public institutions and departments, and this company alone received\r\n    some three millions a year. On an order for six reams of cap paper,\r\n    the same amount of letter paper, two reams of notepaper, two dozen\r\n    pen-holders, four small ink-bottles, and a few other articles, all\r\n    worth not more than fifty dollars, a bill of ten thousand dollars was\r\n    rendered and paid.\r\n\r\n    The frauds upon which the conviction of Tweed was obtained consisted\r\n    in the payment of enormously increased bills to mechanics, architects,\r\n    furniture-makers, and, in some instances, to unknown persons, for\r\n    supplies and services. It was the expectation that an honest bill\r\n    would be raised all the way from sixty to ninety per cent. In the\r\n    first months of the ring’s stealing the increase was about sixty per\r\n    cent. Some of the bills were increased by as much as ninety per cent.,\r\n    but the average increase was such as to make it possible to give\r\n    sixty-seven per cent. to the ring, the confederates being allowed to\r\n    keep thirty-three per cent.; and of that thirty-three per cent.\r\n    probably at least one-half was a fraudulent increase.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the outrageous nature of his stealings provoked a revolt in\r\nTammany itself. It is to this which Mr. Croker looks back with such proud\r\ncomplacency as marking the advent of reformed Tammany. Tweed was beaten at\r\nthe elections, and his opponents secured a majority on the Board of\r\nAldermen. Thereupon the resourceful rascal promptly went down to Albany,\r\nbought up a sufficient number of Congressmen and senators to give him\r\ncontrol of the Legislature, and so secured a new Charter for New York,\r\nwhich legislated his opponents out of office. By this Charter a board of\r\naudit was created which consisted of Tweed, Connolly and Mayor Hall. What\r\nfollowed is thus described by the _Nation_:--\r\n\r\n    The “Board” met once for but ten minutes, and turned the whole\r\n    “auditing” business over to Tweed. This sounds like a joke, but is\r\n    true. Tweed then went to work, and “audited” as hard as he could,\r\n    Garvey and other scamps bringing in the raw material in the shape of\r\n    “claims,” and he never stopped till he had “audited” about 6,000,000\r\n    dols. worth. Connolly’s part in the little game then came in, and that\r\n    worthy citizen drew his warrants for the money, which that\r\n    simple-minded “scholar and gentleman” the Mayor endorsed, without\r\n    having the least idea what was going on. Tweed’s share of the plunder\r\n    amounted to about 1,000,000 dols. in all. The Joint Committee,\r\n    reporting on the condition of the city’s finances, declared that the\r\n    discoverable stealings of three years are 19,000,000 dols., which is\r\n    probably only half the real total.\r\n\r\nNever was a more unblushing rascal, as Mr. Tilden said in his account of\r\nTweed’s sovereignty. The Tammany Ring\r\n\r\n    controlled the State Legislature, the police, and every department or\r\n    functionary of the law; several of the judges on the bench were its\r\n    servile instruments, and issued decrees at its command; it secured the\r\n    management of the election “machine,” and “ran” it at its own free\r\n    will and pleasure; a large part of the press was absolutely at its\r\n    disposal. In the course of three years it had paid to eleven\r\n    newspapers the sum of 2,329,482 dols. (about £466,000) nominally for\r\n    advertisements, most of which were never even published, or never\r\n    seen. Not only the City government, but the lion’s share of the State\r\n    government also had fallen into the hands of “Boss” Tweed and his\r\n    confederates. Millions of dollars were stolen by the conspirators by\r\n    means of “street openings,” “improvements,” new pavements, and other\r\n    frauds. The Ring took from the public treasury a sum amounting to over\r\n    £1,500,000 for furnishing and “repairing” a new Court-house. The\r\n    charges for plastering alone came to about £366,000. For carpets,\r\n    warrants were drawn for £120,000, although there were scarcely any\r\n    carpets in the building. The floors were either bare, or covered with\r\n    oil-cloth. Nearly £100,000 was alleged to have been paid for iron\r\n    safes, and over £8,200 for “articles” not defined and never found. The\r\n    total sum stolen was over £4,000,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM M. TWEED.]\r\n\r\nTweed’s brief but dazzling career--for he was indeed a hero clad in\r\nHell-fire--is said by President Andrews to have cost the City of New York\r\n160,000,000 dols. The fine levied by Germany on the City of Paris after\r\nthe War of 1870-1 was only one-fourth that amount. Fraud may be more\r\ncostly than War. The total direct property loss occasioned by the great\r\nfire at Chicago in 1871, when three square miles of buildings were burned\r\ndown, and 98,500 persons rendered homeless, was only 30,000,000 dols.\r\nabove the plunder of Tweed and his gang. Thus Fraud can be almost as\r\nruinous as Fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. TILDEN.]\r\n\r\nTweed was a fellow, if not of infinite jest like poor Yorick, at least of\r\ninfinite insolent humour. In 1871 he boasted that he had amassed a fortune\r\nof 20,000,000 dols. Nor did he in the least scruple to avow the means by\r\nwhich he acquired it. President Andrews, of Brown University, in telling\r\nthe history of the last quarter century, says, “He used gleefully to show\r\nhis friends the safe where he kept money for bribing legislators, finding\r\nthose of the Tammany-Republican stripe easiest game. Of the contractor who\r\nwas decorating his country place at Greenwich he inquired, pointing to a\r\nstatue, ‘Who the hell is that?’ ‘That is Mercury, the god of merchants and\r\nthieves,’ was the reply. ‘That’s bully,’ said Tweed; ‘put him over the\r\nfront door.’”\r\n\r\nTweed was to the last popular with the masses of the people. Even when the\r\nwhole town was ringing with proofs of his guilt, he stood as candidate for\r\nthe Senate of New York State, and was elected. He had distributed in the\r\npoorer districts some £10,000 worth of coal and flour, and one of his\r\nchampions brought down the house by declaring that “Tweed’s heart has\r\nalways been in the right place, and, even if he is a thief, there is more\r\nblood in his little finger and more marrow in his big toe than the men who\r\nare abusing him have in their whole bodies.”\r\n\r\nThis man, with this excessive development of marrow in his big toe, was\r\nultimately run down by Mr. Tilden and the Committee of Seventy. Connolly,\r\nthe Comptroller, weakened and made terms with his opponents by appointing\r\nMr. Green as Deputy-Comptroller. Mr. Green had little difficulty in laying\r\nhands upon all that was necessary in order to secure the prosecution and\r\nconviction of Tweed. Tweed’s two infamous judges were driven from the\r\nbench, and he himself was clapped into gaol. He made his escape, and\r\nsought refuge in Spain. He was, however, delivered up to the American\r\nauthorities, and reconducted to prison, where he died. To the last Tweed\r\nretained possession of much of his ill-gotten wealth. An offer which was\r\nmade to surrender the residue of his millions in return for his liberty\r\nwas rejected.\r\n\r\nTweed thought himself on the whole, an ill-used man. The judge who tried\r\nTweed declared that he had perverted the “power with which he was clothed\r\nin a manner more infamous, more outrageous, than any instance of a like\r\ncharacter which the history of the civilised world afforded.” But Tweed\r\nhimself declared that he believed he had done right, and was willing to\r\n“submit himself to the just criticism of any and all honest men.” From\r\nthis it would seem that Mr. Croker is not alone in his imperturbable\r\nconsciousness of public rectitude. Tweed on one occasion admitted that he\r\nhad perhaps erred, but he explained he was not to blame. The fault lay\r\nwith human nature in the first place, and with the system under which New\r\nYork was governed in the second. Therein, no doubt, he was right. “Human\r\nnature,” he said, “could not resist such temptations as were offered to\r\nmen who were in power in New York, so long as the disposition of the\r\noffices of the city was at their command.”\r\n\r\nThe most outrageous thing that Tweed ever did was to pass a bill through\r\nthe State Legislature at Albany, giving the judges unlimited power to\r\npunish summarily whatever they chose to consider to be contempt. By this\r\nlaw, which was fortunately vetoed by the Governor, every newspaper in New\r\nYork would have been gagged as effectually as the press of Constantinople.\r\n\r\nAfter Tweed fell, Tammany was reorganised under Honest John Kelly and\r\nRichard Croker. Mr. Godkin declares that Honest John Kelly was only honest\r\nin name. He says:--\r\n\r\n    John Kelly practised the great Greek maxim “not too much of anything,”\r\n    simply made every candidate pay handsomely for his nomination,\r\n    pocketed the money himself, and, whether he rendered any account of it\r\n    or not, died in possession of a handsome fortune. His policy was the\r\n    very safe one of making the city money go as far as possible among the\r\n    workers by compelling every office-holder to divide his salary and\r\n    perquisites with a number of other persons.\r\n\r\nThe same system had prevailed down to the year 1894, when Tammany, for the\r\nfirst time in many years, was driven from power. Just before the upset,\r\nthe New York _Evening Post_ published the records of the twenty-eight men\r\nwho now or recently composed the Executive Committee of Tammany. It showed\r\nthat they were all professional politicians, and that among them were one\r\nconvicted murderer, three men who had been indicted for murder, felonious\r\nassault, and bribery, respectively, four professional gamblers, five\r\nex-keepers of gambling houses, nine who either now or formerly sold\r\nliquor, three whose fathers did, three former pugilists, four former\r\nrowdies, and six members of the famous Tweed gang. Seventeen of these\r\nheld office, seven formerly did, and two were favoured contractors.\r\n\r\nBy these men New York was governed down to the year 1894. All the efforts\r\nof the reformers seemed in vain. Mr. Godkin reluctantly confessed:--\r\n\r\n    The power of the semi-criminal organisation known as Tammany Hall not\r\n    only remains unshaken, but grows stronger from year to year. Every\r\n    year its management descends, with perfect impunity, into the hands of\r\n    a more and more degraded class.\r\n\r\nBut it is ever the darkest hour before the dawn. Although on the very eve\r\nof the November election of 1894 it was declared that “Mr. Croker held\r\nalmost as despotic a sway over New York as an Oriental potentate over his\r\nkingdom,” one month after that statement had been made he was hurled from\r\npower by a great outburst of popular indignation. How that was brought\r\nabout I will now proceed to tell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. E. L. GODKIN, EDITOR OF THE “EVENING POST,” NEW YORK.\r\nThe sworn foe of Tammany.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE LEXOW SEARCHLIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Lowell good-humouredly chaffed John Bull when he declared that\r\n\r\n  He detests the same faults in himself he neglected,\r\n  When he sees them again in his child’s glass reflected,\r\n\r\nand we only need to glance at current English criticisms upon American\r\naffairs to justify the poet’s remark. Especially is this the case with a\r\nvice which of all others is regarded as distinctively English. John Bull\r\nhas plenty of faults, but of those which render him odious to his\r\nneighbours there is none which is quite so loathsome as his “unctuous\r\nrectitude.” That phrase, coined by Mr. Rhodes to express the contempt\r\nwhich he and every one who knew the facts felt on contemplating the\r\nhypocrisy and Pharisaism displayed in connection with the Jameson Raid, is\r\nlikely to live long after Mr. Rhodes has vanished from this mortal scene.\r\nThis tendency to Pharisaism and self-righteous complacency, which thanks\r\nGod that it is not as other men are, is one of those vices which John\r\nBull’s children seem to have inherited in full measure. We are pretty good\r\nat Pharisaism in the Old Country, but we are “not a circumstance,” to use\r\nthe familiar slang, when we compare ourselves to some of the Pharisees\r\nreared across the Atlantic. This has nowhere been brought into such strong\r\nrelief as when on the very eve of the exposure and discomfiture of Tammany\r\ntheir spokesmen took the stump and talked like very Pecksniffs concerning\r\nthe immaculate purity of Tammany Hall.\r\n\r\nThe same characteristic is observable in all of them. Whether it is Boss\r\nTweed, appealing confidently to the verdict of honest men upon a career of\r\ncolossal theft and almost inconceivable fraud; or Mr. Croker, who, after\r\nsurveying his whole life, declares that he has not discovered a single\r\naction which he has reason to regret, for he has not done anything but\r\ngood all his life; or Bourke Cochran, who was at one time the Apollo and\r\nthe Demosthenes of Tammany, the same unctuous rectitude oozes out of every\r\npore. When Tammany was at its heyday of prosperity and power in 1889, it\r\nassembled in its thousands to cheer enthusiastically the impassioned\r\noratory of Mr. Cochran, who declared, as among the self-evident truths\r\nwhich found an echo in every breast, that “if corruption prevails among\r\nthe people, liberty will become a blighting curse, subversive of order.\r\nCorruption once begun, decay is inevitable and irresistible; the\r\ndestruction of the Republic is immediate, immeasurable, irredeemable;\r\nsince history does not record a case of a popular government which has\r\nbeen arrested in its downward course.” Tammany listened to this with\r\necstatic admiration, cheered to the echo their eloquent oracle, and then\r\nwent on using the proceeds of a system of blackmail for the perfecting of\r\nan engine of corruption to which it is difficult to discover a parallel in\r\nthe annals of mankind.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Croker’s case, his calm consciousness of incorruptible virtue seems\r\nto be based upon a curious inversion of a belief in a Divine Providence.\r\nTammany is not strong in theology, but Mr. Croker, in talking to me, based\r\nhis argument in favour of the excellence of Tammany on the postulate that\r\nthe government of the universe was founded on the law of righteousness.\r\nThis being the case, it was only possible to reconcile the continued\r\nexistence of Tammany on one of two hypotheses. Either the domination of\r\nevil was permitted for a season for some sufficient cause hidden in the\r\ninscrutable mysteries of the Divine councils, or we must boldly assert\r\nthat, all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, Tammany rule was in\r\naccordance with the eternal law, _Credo quia impossibile_, rather than\r\nadmit that so great an anomaly as a terrestrial Inferno could be permitted\r\nto exist by the good government of God. Mr. Croker, of course, adopted the\r\nlatter hypothesis. There is much in it, no doubt, especially to those in\r\nMr. Croker’s position. It is, however, open to the fatal objection that\r\nthe same process of logic would _à fortiori_ secure a certificate of good\r\nconduct for the Great Assassin of Stamboul himself. The Ottoman Empire has\r\nlasted even longer than Tammany Hall, but even Mr. Croker would shrink\r\nfrom maintaining that Abdul Hamid was on that account the exemplary\r\nvicegerent of the Almighty.\r\n\r\nThis Pharisaic panoply in which Tammany was clad, as in a coat of mail,\r\nwas no small element of its strength. The consciousness of wrong-doing is\r\nalways an element of weakness. Not until a man can do evil and persuade\r\nhimself that he is doing good can he silence that conscience which makes\r\ncowards of us all. Probably this unctuous rectitude on the part of Tammany\r\nand its Boss should be estimated as one of the chief obstacles in the way\r\nof the scattered and despairing band of reformers who, five or six years\r\nago, confronted the stronghold of iniquity entrenched in their midst.\r\n\r\nIts position, indeed, appeared almost impregnable. Tammany Hall commanded\r\nan annual revenue large enough to equip and maintain a small army. It had\r\nunder its orders the whole of the executive force in its police--a body of\r\nmen practically above the law, armed with powers hardly inferior to those\r\nof the police of St. Petersburg. Besides the police, all the persons on\r\nthe pay-rolls of the City and County were under the thumb of the Boss.\r\nThere was hardly a city official, from the highest to the lowest, who did\r\nnot hold office by the sovereign will and pleasure of Tammany. As there\r\nare 27,000 names on those pay-rolls, all of whom were voters and were\r\ntaxable to an almost unlimited extent whenever the Tammany exchequer\r\nneeded to be replenished, it is obvious how enormous were the odds against\r\nthe assailants of Tammany.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by Tom Reveley, Wantage._ RICHARD CROKER IN HIS\r\nGARDEN AT WANTAGE, BERKSHIRE.]\r\n\r\nBut the unctuous rectitude of its leaders, the prompt obedience of the\r\npolice Janissaries, and the discipline of the standing army of the\r\ntwenty-seven thousand Pretorians on the city pay-rolls, were by no means\r\nthe only difficulties which had to be overcome. Tammany Hall itself might\r\nbe compared to a central citadel or keep of a Norman fortress. The\r\noutworks consisted of all the saloons, gaming hells, and houses of\r\nill-fame in the City of New York. Some of these, no doubt, were by no\r\nmeans enthusiastic in support of the powers that be, but they resembled\r\ntribes which, having been subdued by force of arms, are compelled to pay\r\ntribute and use their weapons in support of their conquerors. In New York,\r\njust before the revolt against Tammany, the number of licences for the\r\nsale of intoxicants in New York City was over 6,000. The number of\r\nunlicensed drinking places was estimated at from 2,000 to 3,000. Each of\r\nthese saloons might be regarded as a detached outwork, holding a position\r\nin advance of the main citadel, and covering it from the attack of its\r\nfoes.\r\n\r\nIn those days it used to be said that licences were granted by the Excise\r\nBoard to anybody who had not served a term in a penitentiary. One\r\nindignant divine declared that it was perfectly safe to say that, if the\r\nDevil himself should apply to the Excise Board for a licence to set up a\r\nbranch establishment on the children’s playground in the Central Park, it\r\nwould be granted. As to the other establishments of even worse fame than\r\nthe saloon, there was an unwritten contract by which, in return for\r\ntribute paid directly or indirectly, they were shielded by the strong arm\r\nof Tammany from the enforcement of the law. It was calculated that if all\r\nthe saloons in New York were placed side by side, averaging them at only\r\ntwenty feet frontage each, they would form a line of circumvallation\r\ntwenty miles long. To put it in another way, there was on an average one\r\nsaloon for every thirty voters.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its control of the saloon, Tammany had two extremely\r\nimportant financial resources which have not yet been mentioned. The first\r\nwas the control of the city contracts. A great city like New York, with an\r\nexpenditure that exceeded that of the whole Federal Government of the\r\nUnited States fifty years ago, had an enormous means of influence at its\r\ndisposal in the mere granting of contracts. But even this was a\r\ncomparatively trivial element in the financial strength of Tammany. There\r\nexisted in New York, as in almost every city, great corporations\r\nrepresenting enormous capital, and dividing gigantic dividends, which, in\r\nthe Tammany scheme of the universe, might have been created for the\r\nexpress purpose of furnishing an unfailing supply of revenue to the party\r\nchest. The corporations which enjoyed franchises from the city, giving\r\nthem control of the streets, whether for the purpose of traction, of\r\nlighting, or of electrical communication, were Tammany’s milch cows. They\r\nall possess monopolies, granted to them in the first instance either by\r\ncorruption or by negligence, which enable them to plunder the public.\r\nThese monopolies can only be terminated or modified by the Legislature,\r\nand the Legislature can only act in obedience to the party machine. All\r\nthat needs to be done when the campaign fund runs low is for the Boss to\r\nintimate to the various corporations that milking time has come, and that\r\nif they do not contribute liberally of their substance to the party\r\ntreasury, Tammany will no longer be able to give them protection when the\r\nusual attack is made next session upon their monopoly or their franchise.\r\nMoney is the sinews of war, and as the Tammany war chest was always full,\r\nTammany snapped its fingers at all its enemies, and contemptuously\r\ndeclared that the reformers did not amount to a row of pins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHILDREN’S PLAYGROUND, CENTRAL PARK, NEW YORK.]\r\n\r\nThe outlook undoubtedly was very gloomy. From the point of view of\r\npractical politics it was simply hopeless; nevertheless, in a couple of\r\nyears the fortress was stormed, and the government of New York placed in\r\nthe hands of the Reformers. The story of the way in which this was brought\r\nabout should never be forgotten by all those who are called upon to lead\r\nforlorn hopes against immense odds. As long as the world lasts, such\r\nnarratives are among the most precious cordials which in times of danger\r\nand distress restore the courage and revive the faith of man. Dr.\r\nParkhurst’s attack on Tammany is one of the latest of a long series of\r\nvictories achieved by the leader of an outnumbered handful. When Gideon\r\nwent forth against the hosts of Midian with only three hundred followers,\r\nhe left a leading case on record for the encouragement of all who should\r\ncome after. How many reformers and revolutionists who have helped the\r\nworld forward in the path of progress have been cheered by the dream in\r\nwhich the Midianitish soldier saw a cake of barley bread smite and\r\noverturn the multitudinous camp of the conqueror, history does not record!\r\nBut if ever a man needed the inspiration of that barley cake it was Dr.\r\nParkhurst, when in 1892 he set himself to the desperate task of wresting\r\nNew York City from the grasp of Tammany.\r\n\r\nDr. Parkhurst was a Massachusetts minister of Puritan ancestry, who, in\r\n1880, at the age of thirty-eight, had been called to Madison Square\r\nChurch, in New York. For ten years he went in and out among the people,\r\nquietly building up his church, ministering to his congregation, and\r\nlearning at first-hand the real difficulties which offered almost\r\ninsuperable obstacles to right living in New York. In 1890, on the eve of\r\nthe November election, he preached a sermon on municipal politics, which,\r\nalthough it failed in influencing the polls, nevertheless marked Dr.\r\nParkhurst out as the man to succeed Dr. Howard Crosby as President of the\r\nSociety for the Prevention of Crime. He took office in 1891. In less than\r\ntwelve months he began the campaign from which he never withdrew his hand\r\nuntil the government of the city was wrested from the control of Tammany.\r\n\r\nNothing is more characteristic, both of the state of things in New York\r\nand the uncompromising directness of Dr. Parkhurst, than the fact that he\r\nhad no sooner assumed the control of the Society for the Prevention of\r\nCrime than he adopted as his motto the significant watchword, “Down with\r\nthe Police!” That fact alone speaks volumes as to how utterly New York\r\nCity had fallen under the control of the Evil One. For a society for the\r\nprevention of crime to adopt “Down with the Police!” as its watchword,\r\nseems to us of the Old World absolutely inconceivable. The police exist\r\nfor the prevention of crime, yet here was a society of leading citizens,\r\npresided over by a doctor of divinity, putting in the forefront of its\r\nprogramme the formula “Down with the Police!”\r\n\r\nStrange though it may seem to us, the best people of New York understood\r\nand appreciated what Dr. Parkhurst was after. But it was not till the 14th\r\nof February, 1892, that he put the trumpet to his lips and blew a blast\r\nthe echoes of which are still sounding through the world. His sermon was\r\nan impeachment of the Government of New York, the like of which had seldom\r\nbeen heard before in a Christian pulpit. If any one questions the justice\r\nof the title of this volume, let him read what Dr. Parkhurst said in the\r\nsermon, of which the following sentence is a fair sample:--\r\n\r\n    There is not a form under which the Devil disguises himself that so\r\n    perplexes us in our efforts, or so bewilders us in the devising of our\r\n    schemes, as the polluted harpies that, under the pretext of governing\r\n    this city, are feeding day and night on its quivering vitals. They are\r\n    a lying, perjured, rum-soaked and libidinous lot.\r\n\r\nThat was plain speaking in honest, ringing Saxon, for Dr. Parkhurst knew\r\nthat there was no better way of spoiling the trump card of the Devil’s\r\ngame than to refuse to let him keep things mixed. He maintained that the\r\ndistrict attorney, or, as we should say, the public prosecutor, was guilty\r\nof complicity with vice and crime: that “every effort to make men\r\nrespectable, honest, temperate, and sexually clean was a direct blow\r\nbetween the eyes of the mayor and his whole gang of drunken and lecherous\r\nsubordinates, who shielded and patronised iniquity.” Criminals and\r\nofficials, he declared, were hand-and-glove, and he summed up the whole\r\nmatter in the following concise exposition of the _status quo_ in “Satan’s\r\nInvisible World” in New York, 1892:--“It is simply one solid gang of\r\nrascals, half of the gang in office and the other half out, and the two\r\nhalves steadily catering to each other across the official line.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From _Frank Leslie’s Weekly_. REV. C. H. PARKHURST, D.D.,\r\nDENOUNCING TAMMANY’S GOVERNMENT OF NEW YORK.]\r\n\r\nOf course there was a great outcry. Some good people were scandalised,\r\nwhile as for the bad ones, they were simply outraged at such “violent and\r\nintemperate utterances in the pulpit.” One of the police captains declared\r\n“it was a shame for a minister of the Gospel to disgrace the pulpit by\r\nsuch utterances.” Dr. Parkhurst was summoned before the Grand Jury, and\r\nsolemnly reproved for making statements which he could not for the moment\r\nsubstantiate with chapter and verse. When the Grand Jury condemned him and\r\nthe judge rebuked him, Tammany was in high glee; but Dr. Parkhurst bided\r\nhis time. He was not a man to be “downed” by censure. Finding that his\r\ngeneral statements were scouted because he could not produce first hand\r\nevidence as to the literal accuracy of each particular instance on which\r\nhe built up his general finding, he took the bold and courageous step of\r\ngoing himself through the houses of ill-fame, gaming hells, and other\r\nresorts which were running open under the protection of the police. He was\r\naccompanied in his pilgrimage by a detective and a lawyer, and for three\r\nweeks every night Dr. Parkhurst, to use his own phrase, “traversed the\r\navenues of our municipal hell.” They entered into no houses not easy of\r\naccess, went into no places which were not recognised as notorious, and\r\nwere perfectly well known by the constable on the beat. In one case they\r\nsucceeded in proving police collusion by getting the policeman on beat to\r\nstand guard while they visited the house, ostensibly for an immoral\r\npurpose, in order to warn them against any signs of a possible raid.\r\n\r\nHaving thus mastered his facts and obtained incontrovertible evidence at\r\nfirst hand as to the fact of police complicity in the wholesale violation\r\nof the law, Dr. Parkhurst stood up in his pulpit on the morning of March\r\n13th, 1892, and once more arraigned the city authorities. This time,\r\nhowever, he was armed with a mass of facts ascertained at first hand, and\r\nsupported by unimpeachable, independent testimony. He brought forward no\r\nfewer than two hundred and eighty-four cases in which the law was\r\nflagrantly violated under the noses of the police, who, he maintained,\r\nwere guilty of corrupt complicity in the violation of the law they were\r\nappointed to enforce.\r\n\r\nIt was a great sermon, and one that shook the city to its centre. Some\r\nidea of its drift and spirit may be gained from this extract:--\r\n\r\n    There is little advantage in preaching the Gospel to a young fellow on\r\n    Sunday, if he is going to be sitting on the edge of a\r\n    Tammany-maintained hell the rest of the week. Don’t tell me that I\r\n    don’t know what I am talking about. Many a long, dismal,\r\n    heart-sickening night, in company with two trusted friends, have I\r\n    spent since I spoke on this matter before, going down into the\r\n    disgusting depths of this Tammany-debauched town; and it is rotten\r\n    with a rottenness that is unspeakable and indescribable, and a\r\n    rottenness that would be absolutely impossible except by the\r\n    connivance, not to say the purchased sympathy, of the men whose one\r\n    obligation before God, men, their own consciences, is to shield virtue\r\n    and make vice difficult. Now, that I stand by, because before\r\n    Almighty God I know it, and I will stand by it though buried beneath\r\n    presentments as thick as autumn leaves in Vallombrosa, or snowflakes\r\n    in a March blizzard.\r\n\r\nAnd stand by it Dr. Parkhurst did. He was promptly summoned again before\r\nthe Grand Jury, and this time he had his facts at command. Instead of\r\nbeing rebuked, the Grand Jury reported emphatically that it was impossible\r\nto reconcile the facts presented by Dr. Parkhurst with any other theory\r\nthan that of wholesale police corruption.\r\n\r\nThe following month various keepers of disreputable houses were prosecuted\r\nupon Dr. Parkhurst’s evidence, when every effort was made to damage Dr.\r\nParkhurst by representing him as the vicious criminal who was responsible\r\nfor the very evils which he had brought to light.\r\n\r\nIt is the old, old story. As long as you sit still and say nothing you are\r\nall right, but the moment you call attention to a hideous wrong or a\r\nshameful crime, all those whose iniquities you have disclosed combine with\r\nyour enemies in order to make a busy public believe that it is you who\r\nhave exposed the crime who is the real criminal, while they, poor\r\ninnocents, are the injured parties, for whom a respectable public should\r\nhave nothing but sympathy, and commiseration.\r\n\r\nThe ferocity of the attacks upon Dr. Parkhurst provoked a reaction in his\r\nfavour. The City Vigilance Society was formed by the association of forty\r\nreligious and secular societies of the city. The work of sapping and\r\nmining went steadily on. In order to bring odium upon Dr. Parkhurst, the\r\npolice suddenly decided to close up several houses of ill-fame, so as to\r\nturn their unfortunate occupants into the streets on one of the coldest\r\nnights of the winter of 1892. Dr. Parkhurst met this by promptly providing\r\nhomes for all the dispossessed women. Foiled in this cruel manœuvre, the\r\npolice prosecuted Dr. Parkhurst’s detective for an alleged attempt to levy\r\nblackmail. This was Satan reproving sin with a vengeance, and for the\r\nmoment it had a temporary success. The detective was convicted, in the\r\nfirst instance, but on appeal the verdict was set aside. Undaunted,\r\nhowever, by this reverse, Dr. Parkhurst began to carry the war into the\r\nenemy’s camp. He got up cases against forty-five of the sixty-four\r\ngambling and disorderly houses which were allowed to run by the police\r\ncaptain of a single precinct. The trials followed with varying results. It\r\nwas evident that the difficulties in the way of obtaining a full\r\ndisclosure of police corruption could only be overcome by special\r\nmeasures. Public opinion was now deeply stirred, and the Chamber of\r\nCommerce memorialised the Senate of New York City to hold an inquiry into\r\nthe Police Department of New York.\r\n\r\nThe Senate appointed a Committee of Investigation, and passed a bill\r\nproviding for the payment of its expenses. This bill was vetoed by\r\nGovernor Flower, himself a Democrat, whose veto elicited another\r\nillustration, if it were wanted, of the marvellous Pharisaism of Tammany\r\nand its friends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOVERNOR FLOWER.]\r\n\r\nWhere party feeling runs high, anything that one party proposes the other\r\none opposes, and Governor Flower, finding the Republican majority of the\r\nSenate in favour of the investigation into the misdeeds of the New York\r\npolice, could only see in it a Republican plot for the manufacture of\r\npolitical capital in the division of political patronage. So he took\r\nspecial objection to any investigation of the Police Department of New\r\nYork. The following passage from the veto message deserves to stand on\r\nrecord as one of the most extraordinary eulogies ever pronounced upon a\r\nrotten system on the very eve of its exposure. Speaking of New York,\r\nGovernor Flower said:--\r\n\r\n    Except for political objects, there is no good reason why that city\r\n    should be singled out for legislative scrutiny. The same men who do\r\n    the investigating in public will admit in private what every\r\n    well-informed person knows is true--that no city in the State is so\r\n    well governed as New York. No city in the State has a lower tax rate;\r\n    no city has a better police regulation; no city has a lower ratio of\r\n    crime; no city has better streets; no city has a better fire\r\n    department; no city has better parks; no city has better schools; no\r\n    city has a better health department; no city has a better credit; no\r\n    city is so comfortable a place to live in. That bad men sometimes get\r\n    in office there is true. That frauds upon the city treasury sometimes\r\n    occur is true; that mal-administration sometimes happens is true; that\r\n    ideal municipal government has not yet been attained there is true;\r\n    but these things are as equally true of every city in the world, they\r\n    are truer of other cities of our State than they are of New\r\n    York.--Lexow Commission, vol. i., p. 10.\r\n\r\nIn order to get round the Governor’s veto, prominent members of the\r\nChamber of Commerce guaranteed to the Committee counsel’s fees to an\r\namount necessary to enable them to prosecute the investigation. Thereupon\r\nthe Committee was appointed and set to work. All its members were Senators\r\nof the State of New York. It was presided over by Mr. Clarence Lexow. The\r\nnames of the other members were Edmund O’Connor, George W. Robertson,\r\nCuthbert W. Pound, Charles T. Saxton, Jacob A. Cantor, Daniel Bradley,\r\nwith William A. Sutherland and John W. Goff as counsel. The only member of\r\nthe Committee representing New York City was Mr. Cantor, who presented the\r\nminority Report, which maintained that the Republicans were as bad as the\r\nDemocrats, and that most of the officials in the Police Department\r\nimplicated in blackmail, fraud and corruption were Republicans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN W. GOFF.]\r\n\r\nThe Committee held its first meeting on the 9th of March, 1894. At the\r\nearlier sittings the Police Department was represented by counsel, but\r\nafter a while he was withdrawn, and the Committee was left to conduct its\r\ninquiries as best it could. It was fortunate in securing the services of a\r\nfamous lawyer, Mr. John W. Goff, who is now Recorder of New York,\r\n“succeeding a man who fined him for contempt because he insisted upon his\r\nrights as counsel in protecting one of Dr. Parkhurst’s agents.” As even\r\nthe one dissentient member of the Committee reported, “No more tireless,\r\nindustrious or effective counsel was ever employed by a Committee charged\r\nwith the responsibility of its character.” As I read over the voluminous\r\nreports of the evidence taken by the Lexow Committee, I could not repress\r\na sigh: would that we had enjoyed the privilege of having such an examiner\r\nas John W. Goff on the South Africa Committee! But, of course, there was\r\none great difference: the Lexow Committee was appointed for the purpose of\r\nfinding out the facts and exposing scandal, whereas the South Africa\r\nCommittee seems to have accepted the theory that it was appointed for\r\nexactly the opposite purpose of hushing them up, and of screening Mr.\r\nChamberlain at any cost.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Lexow Committee when they undertook their duties had no\r\nidea as to how far it would lead them. They thought that two days a week\r\nfor three weeks would complete the investigation. No sooner, however, had\r\nthey begun to apply the probe than they came upon evidence of such\r\nrottenness that even the laziest of them felt they had no option but to go\r\non. Go on they did day after day, taking evidence from morning till night,\r\nbut it was not until the end of the year that they were able to finish\r\ntheir Provisional Report. This was dated January 16th, 1895. In the Report\r\nthey thus summarise the evidence which they took:--\r\n\r\n    The record shows a total of 10,576 pages of proceedings. This does not\r\n    include a mass of documentary exhibits which were read and considered\r\n    in evidence, for the purpose of information. Of this testimony, 1,077\r\n    pages embrace the subject-matter of police interference at the polls,\r\n    and the balance, or almost 9,500 pages, refer to the subject-matter of\r\n    blackmail, extortion and corruption. In all, 678 witnesses were\r\n    examined, of whom 81 were examined on the first and 597 on the second\r\n    branch of the inquiry. In all, about 3,000 subpœnas were served, of\r\n    which upwards of 2,750 were with reference to the second branch of the\r\n    inquiry.--_Ib._, vol. i., p. 4.\r\n\r\nIt is upon this immense body of evidence taken on oath, under\r\ncross-examination in public audiences, that I have based this volume.\r\n“Satan’s Invisible World” is thus displayed, not by a stranger or a casual\r\nobserver, or an amateur investigator. The revelation has been made by\r\nAmerican subjects testifying on oath before an American tribunal as to the\r\nstate of things that actually existed in the City of New York. As the\r\nresult of the investigation the old system of Tammany rule was overthrown,\r\nand the police thoroughly reorganised. They have now as Chief Commissioner\r\nMr. Moss, who, after Mr. Goff, was the chief instrument in exposing the\r\ncorruption of the old system. If any one doubts the accuracy of the\r\npicture of what actually existed down to 1894, which is set forth in this\r\nand the following pages, I can only refer him to the volumes of evidence\r\nto which reference is made throughout in the passages quoted.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that men who have lived in the midst of such a city\r\nshould sometimes burst out like Dr. Parkhurst with the despairing cry:--\r\n\r\n    You can love your country and work for it, pray and plead for it, but\r\n    there is a stage of rottenness which once reached, the country is\r\n    damned beyond the power of the Holy Ghost to do anything for it.\r\n\r\nThat such a state of rottenness has been reached in any part of the\r\nEnglish-speaking world we must all be loath to admit. The great popular\r\nuprising which swept Tammany from power in 1894 was a healthy sign that\r\nthe rottenness had not eaten to the vitals of the community. But the\r\nCharter of Greater New York proves only too well how deeply distrust has\r\nsapped the faith of the citizens in the possibility of governing their\r\ncity by the ordinary democratic machinery of an elective assembly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SENATOR LEXOW.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nSATAN’S INVISIBLE WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE POLICE BANDITS OF NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lexow Committee experienced great difficulty in procuring evidence\r\nowing to the Reign of Terror which was established in New York by the\r\npolice. The story reads more like a description of an Indian province\r\nterrorized by a band of Thugs than a statement of how New York was\r\ngoverned. When unwilling witnesses--and the vast majority of witnesses\r\nwere most unwilling--were placed on the stand, they were thus addressed by\r\nthe Chairman:--\r\n\r\n    Any testimony you give now, under oath, before this Committee with\r\n    reference to bribery or corruption, cannot be used against you in any\r\n    form, shape, or way. The fact of your confession here before this\r\n    Committee will be a complete bar against any prosecution against you\r\n    for that offence. In other words, if you sit here and tell the truth,\r\n    and confess that you have committed any crime of that description, you\r\n    will be absolutely relieved from any punishment for the commission of\r\n    that crime. On the other hand, if you swear to anything that is false,\r\n    then, not only could you be punished for the crime that you committed,\r\n    if you did commit the crime of bribery, but for the crime of false\r\n    swearing, or perjury, besides; you understand that?--Vol. iv., p.\r\n    3,615.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this, the amount of perjury committed, especially by\r\npolicemen, was appalling. One of them, of the name of Interman, admitted\r\nfrankly that it was the common understanding among the members of the\r\nforce that it was their duty to swear falsely to conceal the facts about\r\nbribery and corruption. If they spoke the truth they would be bounced or\r\npersecuted, whereas if they came forward and perjured themselves they\r\nwould stand high with their superiors. The wrath of a captain who can make\r\nit hot for you next day evidently weighed much more with the police than\r\nthe wrath of an offended God, whose mills grind so slowly that retribution\r\nmay not begin till the day of judgment.\r\n\r\nThe answers to questions put to brothel-keepers and others as to their\r\nbelief in the binding character of an oath and the reality of a future\r\nstate were hardly edifying. One woman, Julia Mahoney, broke the record\r\nfor the unhesitating candour with which she answered counsel’s questions.\r\n\r\n“Do you not know,” said Mr. Goff, “that you would meet your punishment in\r\nthe world hereafter?”\r\n\r\n“I hope not,” Julia replied simply.\r\n\r\n“And you know that you would be liable to go to the State’s prison?”\r\npersisted Mr. Goff. But Mrs. Mahoney was proof against that threat.\r\n\r\n“If I was in prison I would be out in twenty-four hours,” she remarked.\r\n“She has got a pull,” sagely observed Senator Bradley.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that it was a task of uncommon difficulty to extract\r\nthe truth from witnesses such as these, who fear not God neither regard\r\nman. Why should they? They have got a pull, and the pull ends all things.\r\n\r\nTwo competent American observers have recently told us what a policeman is\r\nin an American city. Both confirm to the letter what was stated by a\r\nleading citizen of Chicago five years ago. “Never mind what is said about\r\nthis or that system of city government. In Chicago and all the West the\r\npolice govern the city, and that is all there is to it.” In New York it\r\nwould appear to have been much the same. Mr. Theodore Roosevelt, who was\r\nhead of the New York police in the first two years of the Reform\r\nAdministration, writing in the _Century Magazine_ for October, says:--\r\n\r\n    The police occupy positions of great importance. They not merely\r\n    preserve order, the first essential of both liberty and civilisation,\r\n    but to a large portion of our population they stand as the embodiment\r\n    as well as the representative of the law of the land. To the average\r\n    dweller in a tenement-house district, especially if born abroad, the\r\n    policeman is in his own person all that there is of government: he is\r\n    judge, executive and legislature, constitution and town meeting.\r\n\r\nThe other witness is Mr. Godkin, the editor of the _Evening Post_, who,\r\nwriting in the _North American Review_ seven years back, says of the newly\r\nlanded immigrant:--\r\n\r\n    No sooner has he established himself in a tenement-house or a\r\n    boarding-house than he finds himself face to face with three\r\n    functionaries who represent to him the government of his new\r\n    country--the police justice of the district, the police captain of his\r\n    precinct, and the political “district leader.” These are, to him, the\r\n    Federal, State and municipal governments rolled into one.... These\r\n    three men are to him America. Everything else in the national\r\n    institutions in which Americans pride themselves he only sees through\r\n    a glass darkly, if he sees it at all.\r\n\r\nThese dwellers in tenement-houses in New York, to whom the police--of whom\r\nthere were then 4,000--are judge, executive, and legislature, constitution\r\nand town meeting, comprise two-thirds of the population of the city. To\r\nthe foreign denizen of these districts--say one-half of the whole--the\r\npoliceman and his masters of the political machine are all of America that\r\nhe can see or understand.\r\n\r\nNow let us see what kind of an America the New York police presented to\r\nthe eyes of the majority of the population of the city. The Lexow\r\nCommittee in its final Report, after commenting on the difficulty of\r\nobtaining evidence owing to the terrorism practised by the police, said of\r\na typical case:--\r\n\r\n    This situation was characteristic. A consuming desire to put an end to\r\n    an outrageous servitude on the one hand, and a dread lest failure\r\n    might result in a still more galling thraldom on the other! It seemed,\r\n    in fact, as though every interest, every occupation, almost every\r\n    citizen, was dominated by an all-controlling and overshadowing dread\r\n    of the police department.\r\n\r\n    Those in the humbler walks of life were subjected to appalling\r\n    outrages which to some extent continued, even to the end of the\r\n    investigation. They were abused, clubbed and imprisoned, and even\r\n    convicted of crimes on false testimony by policemen and their\r\n    accomplices. Men of business were harassed and annoyed in their\r\n    affairs, so that they too were compelled to bend their necks to the\r\n    police yoke, in order that they might share that so-called protection\r\n    which seemed indispensable to the profitable conduct of their affairs.\r\n    People of all degrees seemed to feel that to antagonize the police was\r\n    to call down upon themselves the swift judgment and persecution of an\r\n    invulnerable force, strong in itself, banded together by self-interest\r\n    and the community of unlawful gain, and so thoroughly entrenched in\r\n    the municipal government as to defy ordinary assault. Strong men\r\n    hesitated when required to give evidence of their oppression, and\r\n    whispered stories; tricks, subterfuges and schemes of all kinds were\r\n    resorted to to withhold from this committee and its counsel the fact\r\n    that they had knowledge of acts of corruption or oppression by the\r\n    police. The uniform belief was that if they spoke against the police,\r\n    or if the police discovered that they had been instrumental in aiding\r\n    your Committee, or had given information, their business would be\r\n    ruined, they would be hounded from the city, and their lives even\r\n    jeopardised.--Vol. i., pp. 25, 26.\r\n\r\nFor wrongs inflicted by the police there was no redress. Mr. Goff in the\r\nconcluding stages of the investigation referred to this phase of the\r\nquestion in the following significant terms:--\r\n\r\n    A great many innocent people who have been clubbed by the police in\r\n    our city have thought that the city was responsible for the actions of\r\n    its employés; but the courts have held time and time again that the\r\n    city is not responsible; and then from the further fact that nearly\r\n    every policeman in the city has his property in his wife’s name, it\r\n    has become a notorious thing that it is useless to bring an action for\r\n    assault against a policeman.... Mr. Jerome reminds me now of the\r\n    celebrated case of Mr. Fleming; I think it was a Decoration Day\r\n    parade. Captain Williams clubbed him in Madison Square, and he got a\r\n    judgment of $2,500; but the judgment was never collected. We have\r\n    never been able to get it on the record that a judgment against a\r\n    police official has been paid.--Vol. v., p. 4,661.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising after this to read the answer of a witness, a\r\njournalist of standing, who had been nearly murdered by a police captain\r\nin the cells of the police-station. He was asked if he had taken\r\nproceedings against his assailant. He replied:--\r\n\r\n    “I never did, sir. It is no use going to law with the Devil, and\r\n    Court, and Hell!”\r\n\r\nTo quote the more formal but not less emphatic finding of the Lexow\r\nCommittee:--\r\n\r\n    It appears, therefore, that the police formed a separate and highly\r\n    privileged class, armed with the authority and the machinery for\r\n    oppression and punishment, but practically free themselves from the\r\n    operation of the criminal law.--Vol. i., p. 30.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A VIEW IN ST. PETERSBURG. A City where the Police have as\r\nmuch power as in New York.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE POWERS AND THE IMPOTENCE OF THE POLICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most pathetic of human fallacies is the assumption that you\r\nhave only to pass a law in order to extirpate an evil. The touching faith\r\nof English-speaking men in the efficacy of statute-made law is nowhere\r\nmore strikingly illustrated than in the great cities of the United States.\r\nThe fact that a statute is only so much good paper inked by a\r\nprinting-press does not seem to occur to the citizens, even after the\r\nrepeated demonstrations of its impotence. Nowhere can severer laws be\r\nfound for the suppression of all manner of vice and crime than in those\r\ncities where vice and crime hold high carnival under the patronage of the\r\npolice. It has been frequently observed that this habit of finding relief\r\nfor moral indignation by placing a stringent law upon the statute-book is\r\nexactly the instinct which leads the private citizen to say “Damn!” There\r\nis a great deal of this swearing at large in the passing of rigorous\r\nstatutes, which are no sooner passed than they appear to be forgotten.\r\nTake, for instance, the laws which were passed from time to time to secure\r\nthe extirpation of vice and crime in the City of New York. They certainly\r\ndid not err in the direction of leniency. The usual complaint of the\r\npolice elsewhere is that they are not vested with sufficient power in\r\norder to deal with the vicious and criminal classes. This cannot be said\r\nwith truth of the New York police, as will be seen from the following\r\nextract from the proceedings before the Lexow Committee:--\r\n\r\n    Mr. Moss: We have got a situation here as autocratic as anything than\r\n    can be found in St. Petersburg; a law was passed in 1873 for the\r\n    purpose of giving the police abundant opportunity to enter such places\r\n    for any purpose that they might see fit to enter.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Goff: Judicial functions have been vested in the Superintendent of\r\n    Police, in a policeman of this city, who, on his own motion, can under\r\n    Section 285 of the Consolidation Act issue a warrant, and on the\r\n    execution of that warrant the doors of any house in the City of New\r\n    York may be broken in. If we had time to introduce evidence of cases,\r\n    we could do so where from spleen and malice on the part of some common\r\n    policeman, the respectable houses have been invaded without colour or\r\n    authority of right, except this arbitrary power given to the police by\r\n    law.\r\n\r\n    Senator O’Connor: That is simply a horrible condition of affairs;\r\n    better submit to a thousand disorderly houses than that one decent\r\n    house should be treated in such a manner.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Goff: Under the law as it exists to-day in the City of New York, a\r\n    policeman who is the Superintendent of Police--that is all he is, a\r\n    policeman--has the power to issue his warrant fully equal to that\r\n    exercised by the Prefect of Police in St. Petersburg....\r\n\r\n    Counsel then read as follows:--\r\n\r\n    “If any member of the police force, or if any two or more\r\n    householders, shall report in writing under his or their signature, to\r\n    the Superintendent of Police that there are good grounds, and state\r\n    them, for believing any house, room or premises within the said city\r\n    to be kept or used as a common gaming-house or common gaming premises\r\n    or room for playing for wagers, or for money at any game of chance, or\r\n    to be kept or used for lewd and obscene purposes or amusements, or the\r\n    deposit or sale of lottery tickets or lottery policies, it shall be\r\n    lawful for the Superintendent of Police to authorise in writing any\r\n    member or members of the police force to enter the same, who may\r\n    forthwith arrest all persons there found offending against the law,\r\n    but none other, and seize all implements of game or lottery tickets or\r\n    lottery policies and convey any person so arrested before a magistrate\r\n    and bring the article so seized to the office of the clerk; it shall\r\n    be the duty of the said Superintendent of Police to cause such\r\n    arrested person to be rigorously prosecuted and such articles seized\r\n    to be destroyed as the orders, rules and regulations of the Board of\r\n    Police shall direct.”\r\n\r\n    There has been no law in our country under our system of a more\r\n    complete, sweeping and comprehensive measure placed within the powers\r\n    of a simple executive office, as the Superintendent of Police is, as\r\n    this law. It exceeds that of the Common Law, where the power is vested\r\n    in a judicial officer to issue a warrant; but here a policeman may\r\n    authorise in writing any members of his police force to enter any\r\n    place complained of by either a member of the police force or by two\r\n    householders, and arrest all such persons found therein.--Vol. iv.,\r\n    4,493-7.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this right of domiciliary visitation, which equals or\r\nexceeds that possessed by the Prefect of St. Petersburg, we have it\r\nadmitted on all hands that it utterly failed in attaining its end. The\r\npolice machine, Mr. Goff declared, was by no means inefficient. Regarded\r\nas a machine it was indeed, in his opinion, the most perfect machine ever\r\ninvented in New York. Notwithstanding all its mechanical perfection the\r\nresult was nothing but organised impotence.\r\n\r\nWitness after witness appeared on the stand to attest the extraordinary\r\ninability of the police authorities to cope with the flagrant evils in the\r\ncity or in the force under their command. On one occasion it was proved\r\nthat the agents of the Society for the Prevention of Crime had been hunted\r\nby a mob of bullies and crooks for half a mile through Bowery. It was a\r\nregular riot, in which the agents for the Society were struck and stoned\r\nthrough the whole of Captain Devery’s precinct; the police officers\r\nlooking on as amused spectators. They were appealed to for assistance, and\r\ntook no notice. At last, the hunted men jumped on a car, and escaped with\r\ntheir lives. But although this riot had taken place in the heart of the\r\ncity, and created a scandal through the whole of New York, Superintendent\r\nByrnes reported that he could not find any evidence that there had been a\r\nriot (p. 4,834.) The extraordinary inability of the police to see what was\r\ngoing on under their noses, although apparently phenomenal, was so\r\nhabitual that it ceased to excite any surprise. Saloons ran open all\r\nSunday under the eyes of the patrolmen. The Superintendent of the Society\r\nfor the Prevention of Crime gave evidence on this subject as follows:--\r\n\r\n    I pointed out an open saloon to a patrolman, whose name I do not know,\r\n    and inquired why he did not close it; he said that if I insisted upon\r\n    it, he supposed he must do so; but it would do no good, and only get\r\n    him in trouble with the department and cause his removal to some\r\n    undesirable precinct.--Vol. v., p. 4,835.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN C. SHEEHAN. Ex-Police Commissioner. Boss of Tammany.]\r\n\r\nBut it is only when the Police Commissioners, who stand at the head of the\r\nwhole force, are under examination that we discover the extent of their\r\nutter inability to find out anything. There was, for instance, Mr.\r\nSheehan, who at that time was Police Commissioner, and who now is the\r\ntitular Boss of Tammany Hall. The question of pool-rooms was under\r\nconsideration when he admitted that they existed, and that he knew they\r\nwere corrupting the police. Then the Chairman put the following\r\nquestion:--\r\n\r\n    And, notwithstanding the fact that you knew or had heard that those\r\n    pool-rooms were corrupting the police, you thought it was not\r\n    necessary to take any action upon it?\r\n\r\nMr. Sheehan replied:--\r\n\r\n    I did start an inquiry to find out if those pool-rooms were paying,\r\n    what they were paying, and who they were paying it to. I did that\r\n    within a few months after I became a Police Commissioner, but I\r\n    couldn’t get any authoritative information of any kind on the subject;\r\n    but I got it from all sides that they were paying, and it was\r\n    believed that they were, but no person would substantiate or stand for\r\n    it.--Vol. iv., p. 3,765.\r\n\r\nSo he abandoned the subject as one which it was no use discussing any\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nIt was just the same with Mr. Commissioner Martin. He was asked concerning\r\nthe existence of corruption in the police force. I quote the following\r\nfrom the Record:--\r\n\r\n    Examined by Mr. Sutherland: What did you do to restore the tone and\r\n    efficiency of the police?\r\n\r\n    A. The Board of Police was waiting for any evidence of that character\r\n    to be brought to it.--Vol. i., p. 483.\r\n\r\n    Q. What investigation has the Police Commissioners ever instituted to\r\n    discover the falsity of those charges?\r\n\r\n    A. No special investigation.--Vol. i., p. 484.\r\n\r\nIt was the same thing with disorderly houses.\r\n\r\n    Examined by Mr. Nicoll: And, during all the years you have been Police\r\n    Commissioner, you never have examined the record to see how many there\r\n    are or where they are located?\r\n\r\n    A. No, sir; I have not.\r\n\r\n    Q. And hasn’t that led you to go to these records to see what houses\r\n    were put down as disorderly in this category?\r\n\r\n    A. No, sir; I have not.\r\n\r\n    Q. Has the subject of suppression or diminution of these disorderly\r\n    houses been a matter of discussion before the Board of Police?\r\n\r\n    A. No, sir.--Vol. i., p. 528.\r\n\r\nEven when crime was discovered, when the criminal was, as it were, taken\r\nred-handed, there seemed to be a strange paralysis that prevented his\r\nappearance in court. This affected other Boards besides that of the\r\nPolice. When the action of the Excise Board was under consideration, it\r\nwas admitted by Mr. Andrews, a Commissioner of the Board, that in one\r\nnotorious case the licence had been obtained by false swearing. Mr. Goff\r\nasked:--\r\n\r\n    Q. Did you ever, when you discovered these false papers, as you say,\r\n    and of perjuries having been committed before the Board--did you ever\r\n    take any steps to have the perpetrators called to answer for the\r\n    crime?\r\n\r\n    A. No steps were ever taken for indictment; no.--Vol. iv., p. 4,386.\r\n\r\nIt was not for want of painstaking on the part of the Legislature that the\r\npolice force was not more efficient. Every constable before being\r\nappointed had to comply with the provisions of the Civil Service law,\r\nwhich were thus explained by Commissioner Martin:--\r\n\r\n    The candidate is required to have the names of a certain number of\r\n    citizens, usually five, to vouch for him as to his character--their\r\n    acquaintance with him; and all those papers having been finally\r\n    completed, the papers are sent to the Civil Service Board, where\r\n    examinations are held from time to time of batches of such applicants.\r\n    Application is made to the captain for examination of his character\r\n    and as to the persons who signed the paper, and a report is made in\r\n    writing by the captain. There are three Civil Service Commissioners\r\n    appointed by the Mayor; I do not recollect the names just at this\r\n    time. Once a year the Civil Service Board made an examination of all\r\n    applicants for patrolmen, and they usually examine in batches of from\r\n    400 to 600.--Vol. i., p. 567.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners themselves, when asked about the subject, were at a loss\r\nto explain how it was vice and crime flourished under their very eyes. Mr.\r\nJohn McClave, the Republican Police Commissioner, told the Committee that\r\nhe had always voted with his Tammany Commissioners on the Board, because\r\n“he had never known them to do anything wrong.” There was a very touching\r\nlittle scene described by Mr. McClave’s son-in-law, as to the grief which\r\nthe appointment of the Lexow Committee occasioned Mr. McClave. Mr. and\r\nMrs. McClave were going to a reception one night, and, said Mr. Gideon\r\nGranger, the son-in-law--\r\n\r\n    Mr. McClave was quite nervous, and Mrs. McClave turned to him and\r\n    said, “Why, Johnnie, what is the matter with you?” And he says, “Oh,\r\n    nothing, nothing.” And she says, “Oh yes, there is; it is that police\r\n    investigation business. I would not worry over that.” And he said, “I\r\n    don’t see why it is those hayseed politicians up in Albany want to\r\n    come down here and bother us honest men.”--Vol. i., p. 1,162.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Mr. McClave’s pathetic lament, the Lexow Committee went on\r\nwith its work, and the conduct of these “honest men” was brought forth to\r\nthe light of day. With results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUPERINTENDENT BYRNES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW YORK AND BROOKLYN BRIDGE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPROMOTION BY PULL AND PROMOTION BY PURCHASE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New York Police Department as it existed in 1894 was like the Scribes\r\nand Pharisees in the Gospel. It was like unto whited sepulchres, which\r\nindeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s bones\r\nand of all uncleanness. Hardly a single thing that was proved to exist\r\ncould have existed if the laws, rules and regulations had been faithfully\r\nenforced. Therefore until the searchlight of the Lexow inquiry was turned\r\non, it was the correct thing to deny that the abuses, the corruption, the\r\nblackmail had any existence. On paper the New York police was the finest\r\nin the world. It was the most perfectly equipped, and it was armed with\r\nauthority as great as that of any autocrat. What then could possibly be\r\nwrong?\r\n\r\nThe answer of the Lexow Committee, after hearing the evidence, was short\r\nand succinct. Their answer to the question, What is wrong in the Police\r\nDepartment? might be summed up in one word--Everything. From the crown of\r\nthe head down to the sole of the feet, the department was proved to be one\r\nmass of putrefying sores. There was no health in it, and it was worst of\r\nall at the top.\r\n\r\nThe Lexow Report says:--\r\n\r\n    The conclusion which has impressed itself upon your Committee is that\r\n    the disorganising elements at work in the Police Department are such\r\n    that operate from the higher officials down, rather than from the\r\n    patrolmen up.--Vol. i., p. 29.\r\n\r\nBut the origin of the mischief was found to exist not in the department at\r\nall, but outside the department. The first thing that was wrong was that\r\nthe police were practically run by Tammany Hall politicians in the\r\ninterest of their party, and that the real governing power in the force\r\nlay outside of it. Two of the Police Commissioners in whose hands the\r\ncontrol of the force was nominally lodged were leaders in their own\r\ndistricts for Tammany Hall, and their sense of their obligations to their\r\nparty far outweighed their obligations to the law or to the city. As one\r\nof the witnesses put it bluntly:--\r\n\r\n    So long as our municipal departments are run by Boss Croker, they will\r\n    be regarded as adjuncts of a political organisation, and will be used\r\n    to perpetuate its power. A police commission controlled by such\r\n    influence is incapable of rendering justice.--Vol. i., p. 114.\r\n\r\nFrom an English point of view what New York needed most was a City\r\nCouncil, with some effective control over the affairs of the city. The\r\nshadowy unreality known as the Board of Aldermen cuts no figure in the\r\ninquiry into the forces which actually governed New York. Tammany Hall,\r\nthe executive committee of Tammany Hall, came much nearer to the ideal of\r\na Municipal Assembly than the Board of Aldermen. It was to Tammany Hall,\r\nand not to the Board of Aldermen, that the Police Commissioners appealed\r\nwhen they wanted to enforce their authority over the men under their own\r\norders. This came out very plainly in Commissioner Martin’s evidence. He\r\nfound that his subordinates were taking so active a hand in politics,\r\njoining political clubs and the like, that he wished to check it. He went,\r\nnot to the Board of Aldermen, but to Tammany Hall. He was asked:--\r\n\r\n    Q. Why did you go there?\r\n\r\n    A. I took occasion to speak in Tammany Hall about it, because there I\r\n    could reach people from different assembly districts; I have spoken to\r\n    representatives of the different districts about it in my office.\r\n\r\n    Q. And you went to Tammany Hall to engage their co-operation in\r\n    securing greater efficiency of the police force in New York city?\r\n\r\n    A. To aid in making it efficient; yes, sir.\r\n\r\n    Q. Was that because there was no other place to go to?\r\n\r\n    A. There was no other place to go to that would be as effective as\r\n    that.--Vol. i., p. 443.\r\n\r\nNo wonder the Committee reports:--\r\n\r\n    No stronger illustration is necessary to show how under the then\r\n    existing conditions a political faction had impressed itself so\r\n    strongly upon the police force that its authority was more potent than\r\n    that of the nominal chiefs of the department.--Vol. i., p. 19.\r\n\r\nIt was to Tammany Hall also that the liquor dealers appealed for\r\nprotection from the intolerable exactions of the police. “There was no\r\nother place to go to.” The legal authorities were paralysed by the extreme\r\ndistrust felt by Americans in all elective assemblies. Tammany Hall\r\nnaturally and inevitably became the one living centre of popular authority\r\nin the city. Its moral authority in New York was something like that of\r\nthe Land League over Ireland under Mr. Parnell. The Lexow Committee report\r\nwith a certain jealous awe concerning the “supreme head of authority,” Mr.\r\nRichard Croker, who, although a private citizen, unconnected with the\r\nPolice Department, but leader of Tammany Hall, “was able to do what all\r\nthe other legally constituted authorities failed to accomplish.” They\r\nsay:--\r\n\r\n    The same private citizen whose authority was so potent to accomplish\r\n    all this, was able, by a word of command, at once to shut up all the\r\n    pool-rooms then in full operation, and which, according to the\r\n    testimony up to that time, neither the whole force of police, of\r\n    detectives, of superintendent, or of the Commissioners themselves\r\n    could effectively close.--Vol. i., pp. 18-19.\r\n\r\n“Taken as a whole,” says the Lexow Report, “the records disclose the fact\r\nthat the Police Department, from the highest down to the lowest, was\r\nthoroughly impregnated with the political influence of Tammany Hall”; and\r\nthey add, what naturally follows, “that the suppression and repression of\r\ncrime depended not so much upon the ability of the police to enforce the\r\nlaw, but rather upon the will of that organisation or faction to have the\r\nlaw enforced” (vol. i., p. 19).\r\n\r\nThe leaders of Tammany, no doubt, were not “agin the law” in the abstract.\r\nBut they owed their first allegiance to their party, and their first\r\nthought was not of the duty they owed to the city, but of the duty they\r\nowed to Tammany. The claims of that great brotherhood had precedence over\r\nsuch trifles as the laws of the State, which after all were passed by\r\n“Hayseed” legislators, or, in plain English, by the rustic vote of the\r\nrural districts of the State of New York. One redoubtable worthy, Judge\r\nand ex-Senator Roesch, who figures conspicuously in this American Tartarus\r\nas one of the minor Plutonian deities, gave very interesting evidence on\r\nthis point. He was a Judge, an ex-Senator, and a leader of Tammany Hall.\r\nHis aid in the latter capacity seems to have been generally invoked by the\r\nvarious law-breakers of the neighbourhood. He was asked by Senator\r\nO’Connor whether it was not one of the duties of the district leader, “if\r\nthe members of his party were labouring under any kind of difficulty at\r\nall, for the purpose of conducting his organisation and making that solid\r\nwith the parties, to do what he could to give them aid?”\r\n\r\nThe Senator answered unhesitatingly, “In every case.” When he was proved\r\nto have received money from keepers of disorderly houses, whose girls were\r\nrun in by the police, he said that he received it entirely as a lawyer for\r\ngiving legal advice. But he admitted that when he went to the\r\nstation-house to bail out the girls, he acted as a political leader. So\r\nthe Chairman observed, “You advised as a lawyer and acted as a political\r\nleader in carrying out your advice.” Mr. Senator Roesch is in many ways a\r\nmore typical representative of Tammany than Mr. Croker himself. Both,\r\nhowever, agree on one principle. They always stick by their friends, and\r\nwhen anything is going they see that, their supporters are not left out in\r\nthe cold. This, which would be denounced as scandalous nepotism on the\r\npart of a less democratic Government, was unblushingly proclaimed as the\r\nsole saving principle of appointing officials under Tammany. Senator\r\nRoesch had used his influence or political pull in order to induce the\r\nPolice Commissioner Martin to transfer one Sergeant Schryer to another\r\nprecinct. Questioned by Mr. Goff before the Committee as to the grounds\r\nfor this intervention on his part in the promotion of the police, he made\r\nthe following answer:--\r\n\r\n    A. I will tell you; when a man comes to me and wants to get an\r\n    appointment or transfer, or anything like that, I never stop to\r\n    consider who is in the place he wants to go to, but my object is to\r\n    get him there; necessarily, somebody has got to get out of the way,\r\n    and here it happened to be Sergeant Schryer....\r\n\r\n    If I can get a friend of mine on the force, or get him a promotion or\r\n    position on the force, I always try to do it.\r\n\r\n    Q. And without inquiring, whether or not the man who is going to\r\n    suffer by the removal, who was to suffer?\r\n\r\n    A. That was none of my business; it was sufficient for me to know the\r\n    man they appointed to that place was competent and worthy of it, was a\r\n    friend or party organisation.\r\n\r\n    By Senator O’Connor: A political leader or a man holding a high\r\n    position here in the city, regardless entirely of the merits of the\r\n    man whom he seeks to remove, when requested by one of his\r\n    friends--political friends--to secure his position, that leader does\r\n    everything in his power to bring about that result?\r\n\r\n    A. For his friend.\r\n\r\n    By Mr. Goff: Now, we have it that both parties do it?\r\n\r\n    A. Certainly.\r\n\r\n    Q. Only that the Republican leaders do not have a pull?\r\n\r\n    A. Well, Republican leaders are not in the majority; New York city is\r\n    more a Democratic city.--Vol. ii., pp. 1,283-4.\r\n\r\nMr. Roesch confessed with frank brutality the principle upon which all the\r\npoliticians acted in relation to the patronage to which they believed they\r\nwere entitled. To make room for their friend, to secure a place on the\r\ncity pay-rolls for a political comrade, was ample justification for\r\ninsisting upon the removal of any officer who might happen to be in the\r\nway. Let no one imagine that this was an exceptional case. Commissioner\r\nMartin admitted frankly that from eighty-five to ninety per cent. of all\r\nthe appointments which he had made when he was chairman of the Police\r\nBoard were endorsed, in the first instance, by the district leader of\r\nTammany Hall for the district in which the applicant resided.\r\n\r\nUnder such a system promotion by merit was practically non-existent. On\r\nthis point Commissioner Martin was equally frank. He was questioned very\r\nclosely as to whether he had ever promoted an officer simply for merit.\r\nAfter thinking a bit, he said he thought he could name one or two cases.\r\nThen said Mr. Goff:--\r\n\r\n    So far as your recollection goes, with the exception of two instances,\r\n    so long as you have been police commissioner, you have not recommended\r\n    for appointment, promotion or transfer a single man, except one, who\r\n    was backed by political influence?\r\n\r\n    A. I do not recollect of any others. I think there are others of\r\n    them.--Vol. vi., p. 448.\r\n\r\nBut if a district leader of the type of Roesch was able to nominate\r\nofficers to the police, what becomes of the law by which all officers were\r\nto be appointed by open competition in an examination conducted according\r\nto Civil Service rules? The answer to this question is twofold. In the\r\nfirst case, a certain margin was allowed to the Commissioners. They were\r\nnot bound always to appoint the candidates who came out on top. If they\r\nwere tolerably near the top, it was held to be sufficient. The second\r\nanswer is much more extraordinary. It was proved before the Committee that\r\nby connivance with a police clerk it was quite possible for candidates to\r\nbe returned as having passed their examinations who had never been in\r\nthe examination-hall, and who never had written a single answer to any of\r\nthe questions! This was done by personation. A competent person entered\r\nhimself in the name of the candidate, filled in his examination papers,\r\nand passed in his name. By this means there was no difficulty in driving a\r\ncoach and four through the Civil Service rules. The persons who obtained a\r\nposition on the force by this means were known as the pupils of those who\r\npassed their examinations in their study, and were blackmailed\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CITY HALL PARK, BROADWAY.]\r\n\r\nJohn Schlie, examined by Mr. Moss, described how one of the personators\r\nwent gathering in his fees:--\r\n\r\n    I went down one day with Dave Brant to the police headquarters. We met\r\n    an officer; the next thing I know I saw two 10-dollar bills slipped in\r\n    his hand: he said, “That is good;” I said, “How did you get that?” He\r\n    said, “That is one of my students;” I said, “What do you mean?” he\r\n    said, “I passed for them people;” he said, “That is good;” so we went\r\n    and had a drink and walked a couple of blocks; he commenced scratching\r\n    his head, and he said, “I guess I have another student;” he goes down\r\n    there and gets 15 dollars more.--Vol. ii., p. 1,474.\r\n\r\nOf course, it was impossible thus to cheat the Civil Service examinations\r\nwithout the connivance of some of the officials, and this connivance had\r\nto be paid for at a price. Thus the natural process, promotion by pull,\r\nled up to promotion by purchase. The evidence on this point was\r\noverwhelming. It appeared that in a very great number of cases--so many\r\nindeed as practically to establish the rule--candidates who wished to be\r\nappointed to the force had to pay 300 dollars to a go-between, who\r\nnegotiated the matter with the police authorities. How much money stuck to\r\nthe fingers of the go-between, and how much was passed on to those in\r\nauthority, does not clearly appear, but there is no doubt that the sum of\r\n300 dollars was demanded, and paid, as a preliminary before the candidate\r\ncould assume the uniform of policeman.\r\n\r\nThis practice once begun, it rapidly extended. As the initial cost was 300\r\ndollars, each step in promotion cost a larger sum. To be made a sergeant\r\ncost 1,600 dols., while the price of a captaincy was 15,000 dollars! The\r\npolice who had purchased their promotion in this fashion naturally felt\r\nthat they had a vested interest in their posts. In the British army a\r\nsimilar system of purchase grew up, but it was one which was regulated by\r\nlaw and sanctioned by custom, whereas in the case of the New York police\r\nthe whole system was under the ban of the law. The Lexow Committee\r\nremarked in their report upon this subject:--\r\n\r\n    The policeman who pays for his appointment commences his career with\r\n    the commission of a crime, and it is not strange that the\r\n    demoralisation thus engendered should follow him in his further\r\n    career. The captain who pays a fortune for his appointment finds\r\n    himself compelled to recoup in order to return the moneys loaned to\r\n    him by his friends by resorting to the practices which have been\r\n    disclosed in the record before us. It seems incredible that men who\r\n    are otherwise law-abiding and efficient should stoop to the\r\n    perpetration of the monstrous and debasing practices revealed by this\r\n    record, unless influenced by a system existing as the result of the\r\n    conditions hereinbefore alluded to. Nor is it strange that, in the\r\n    contemplation of these practices by superior officers, inferior\r\n    members of the force should have become demoralised, until the\r\n    contamination has spread throughout the entire department.--Vol. i.,\r\n    pp. 49, 50.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked how was it that, while the evil was still in its infancy,\r\nand the force as a whole was not yet tainted through and through, its\r\nhonest members did not expose the corruption which was being established\r\nin their midst? The answer is that the evil began at the top and spread\r\ndownwards. Hence, it was impossible for the private constable to make a\r\nstand without exposing himself to a severe punishment for daring to be\r\nmore virtuous than his superiors. The following extract from Gideon\r\nGranger’s evidence will show how this pressure from above operated upon\r\nthose below:--\r\n\r\n    A. I did not come to court because of the threats that were made by\r\n    Mr. McClave and Mr. Nicoll, and I knew the power that a police\r\n    commissioner has got, to use every bit of the department against\r\n    anybody, to accomplish their own ends, and, in fact, he has boasted of\r\n    that.\r\n\r\n    Q. Mr. McClave?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir; endless power he has boasted of.\r\n\r\n    Q. What has he said in his boasting?\r\n\r\n    A. He said police commissioners had more power than the President of\r\n    the United States had; repeatedly said that.--Vol. i., p. 1,142.\r\n\r\nIn considering the action of the police, we ought in justice to remember\r\nthat they were living in a city the whole administration of which was\r\ninfected by this money canker.\r\n\r\nMr. William M. Ivins, private secretary to Mayor Grace, by whom he was\r\nappointed City Chamberlain, estimated that in his time “assessments”--that\r\nis, money paid by candidates to “guarantee the result” of their\r\nelections--averaged £40,000 per annum. He wrote:--\r\n\r\n    “The existing system amounts to an almost complete exclusion from\r\n    official public life of all men who are not enabled to pay, if not a\r\n    sum equal to the entire salary of the office they seek, at least a\r\n    very large percentage of it. The poor man, or the moderately\r\n    well-to-do man, is thus at once cut off from all political ambition,\r\n    because the only key to success is wealth or machine power. The ablest\r\n    lawyer at our Bar could not secure a nomination for a judgeship unless\r\n    he were able to pay an assessment of from 10,000 dollars to 20,000\r\n    dollars (£2,000 to £4,000); while a mere political lawyer, if he have\r\n    the means of paying his assessment and stands well with the party\r\n    leaders, can without great difficulty secure a nomination, and even an\r\n    election, to an office for which he has no peculiar qualifications.”\r\n\r\nIt would therefore be unjust to judge the police without making due\r\nallowance for the condition of their environment.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting witnesses who came before the Committee was\r\nCaptain Creedon. It was in his case that the facts concerning the purchase\r\nof promotion were brought out most clearly.\r\n\r\nCreedon was an Irishman, with a distinguished record and a high character.\r\nHe joined the police force in 1864, and was made sergeant after fifteen\r\nyears in the ranks. He remained sergeant for thirteen years, when he was\r\npromoted to a captaincy. Before he entered the police he had served with\r\ngreat gallantry in the Union army. He served with his regiment in no fewer\r\nthan twenty-three engagements. He entered as a private, rose to be a\r\nsergeant, and his name was down for a first lieutenancy when he left the\r\narmy. His record on the police for thirty years’ service was extremely\r\ngood, hardly anything being entered to his discredit. Such entries as were\r\nto be found related only to breaches of the technical rules of the force,\r\nand in no way implied any moral guilt.\r\n\r\nCaptain Creedon was put in the witness-box, and asked how much he had paid\r\nto be made a captain. He denied he had paid anything. As the facts were\r\nperfectly well known, the Committee was much startled by Captain Creedon’s\r\nperjury. But after adjournment had given time for reflection, the worthy\r\nCaptain came to the stand and explained that he had denied everything\r\nbecause he was an Irish revolutionist, and that he had such a dread and\r\nterror of being regarded as an informer, that he preferred to perjure\r\nhimself rather than incur that disgrace. He was willing to sacrifice\r\nhimself and risk going to gaol for perjury rather than in any way\r\nimplicate any of his friends in the improper and illegal transactions in\r\nwhich he had been engaged.\r\n\r\nIt was carefully explained to him that he was not in Ireland, and that\r\nnothing he could possibly say on the stand could expose him to the\r\nimputation of being an informer. Having received this assurance, Captain\r\nCreedon opened his mouth and spoke.\r\n\r\nThe story he had to tell was very simple. Three times he had gone up for\r\nexamination for a captaincy before the Civil Service Board. He had passed\r\ncreditably every time, but notwithstanding this, he seemed no nearer to\r\nsecuring an appointment. His friends kept on telling him that he was\r\nsimply wasting his time going up for examination after examination. He had\r\nmuch better stay at home unless he made up his mind to do one thing. He\r\nsteadily turned a deaf ear to their representations, until at last four\r\nyears after his first application, seeing that no one was promoted without\r\nbribing their superiors, he consented to fall in with the general\r\npractice. As soon as he did this, the way was made plain before him. Mr.\r\nReppenhagen, the representative of the New York Democracy in his district,\r\nwas indicated as the man to approach Police Commissioner Voorhis. Mr.\r\nReppenhagen saw the Commissioner, and reported to the Captain that the\r\nplace could be had for 12,000 dollars. Creedon had not at that time 12,000\r\ndollars to invest in the purchase of a captaincy, but on talking it over\r\nwith his friends, they agreed to make up a purse, so as to enable him to\r\nacquire the position which he coveted. While they were raising the money,\r\nReppenhagen reappeared, and announced that a certain sergeant named\r\nWeigand had offered 12,000 dollars for the captaincy, and that if Creedon\r\nwished to secure it, it would cost him 15,000 dollars. Creedon’s friends\r\nwere men of mettle, and they agreed to raise the full sum. Creedon gave\r\nthe subscribers notes acknowledging their subscriptions as a loan, which\r\nhe afterwards repaid. The money was raised, and deposited in a bank. A Mr.\r\nMartin then appears on the scene as the confidential man of the Police\r\nCommissioner, smelling round after the 15,000 dollars as a rat noses round\r\na cheese. For some reason or other there was a hitch in the appointment,\r\nand Creedon’s friends and Reppenhagen passed some days in horrible\r\nsuspense as to whether or not, in spite of the money being “put up,” the\r\nappointment might go to Sergeant Weigand, while Martin was equally alarmed\r\nlest the 15,000 dollars should slip through his fingers.\r\n\r\nThe Record contains the following entries:--\r\n\r\n    John W. Reppenhagen examined by Mr. Goff: Do you remember saying to\r\n    Martin further, that as long as Creedon’s friends had put up more\r\n    money than Weigand was reported to have put up, that it would play the\r\n    devil in the organisation in that district if Creedon was not\r\n    appointed?\r\n\r\n    A. I might have said that.--Vol. v., p. 5,010.\r\n\r\n    Q. Don’t you remember when you said that to Martin, that Martin said\r\n    in word and in substance as follows: “I will go right down and I will\r\n    see Voorhis, who is too damned hoggish about this thing.” Do you\r\n    remember those words?\r\n\r\n    A. I don’t remember the words.\r\n\r\n    Q. When he was in that condition of excitement, and when he struck the\r\n    bar several times with his clenched fist, didn’t he say those words,\r\n    “That Voorhis wanted everything, almost the earth; he was hoggish, and\r\n    he would go right down to New York and talk right up to him, and tell\r\n    him he must do the right thing?”\r\n\r\n    A. In substance he said that--yes.--Vol. v., p. 5,014-5.\r\n\r\nReppenhagen was evidently in a state of great uneasiness about securing\r\nthe patronage for which the money had been raised by Creedon’s friends. By\r\nway of enforcing his representations, he reminded Mr. Martin pointedly\r\nthat the only chance he had of fingering any of the money was to see that\r\nCreedon’s appointment went through, otherwise he would not make a cent.\r\nThus pressed, Martin went off to see Voorhis. When he next saw Reppenhagen\r\nhe assured him that it was all right, and that Voorhis had pledged his\r\nword to appoint Creedon the next Board Day. Even after this there was a\r\nhitch. It was reported that Weigand was going to be appointed after all.\r\nReppenhagen then found it necessary to take hold of the affair with a\r\nstrong hand.\r\n\r\n“John,” said he to Martin, “you had better go down yourself, and stay by\r\nthe Commissioner until the appointment is made.” Thus adjured, John went\r\ndown, vowing that he would not leave the Commissioner until he had\r\nappointed Creedon. Then at last Creedon was duly appointed.\r\n\r\nAfter this another hitch arose as to the difficulty of paying over the\r\nmoney. Then it was Mr. Martin’s turn to be uneasy. He said he thought he\r\nhad been bilked, and that the money would never be turned over. Creedon’s\r\nfriends, however, were men of affairs, and knew the kind of gentry they\r\nwere dealing with. They had refused to hand over the money until the\r\nCaptain was duly appointed. But now that Creedon was a captain at last\r\nthey released the money. When Reppenhagen handed over the fifteen thousand\r\ndollars to Martin, that functionary handed him back five thousand dollars\r\nfor himself. How much of the ten thousand dollars went to Commissioner\r\nVoorhis or how much of it stuck to Martin’s fingers the record does not\r\nshow. Here, however, was clear and unmistakable evidence as to the\r\nsystematic manner in which promotions were arranged for and carried\r\nthrough between the Commissioners on the one hand and the candidates on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nThere is a sequel to this story, which is so exquisitely absurd that it\r\nseems more like _opera bouffe_ than a chapter from recent history. While\r\nthe Committee was still engaged in ferreting out how the money was paid\r\nwhich secured Captain Creedon his captaincy, a startling rumour reached\r\nthe Committee that the Police Board had suspended Captain Creedon from\r\nduty on account of his having obtained his captaincy by corrupt means. A\r\nbombshell falling in the court could hardly have created greater\r\nconsternation.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the Committee was a privileged body. All its proceedings\r\nwere privileged. For any outside authority to act upon the testimony which\r\nit had taken without the direct authorisation of the Committee would be a\r\ncontempt of the Senate. Further, the evidence given by Captain Creedon was\r\ntendered on the assurance of the Committee that no action could be taken\r\nupon it by any outside authority. They had promised him protection and\r\nimmunity from persecution and prosecution, and for the Police Board to use\r\nhis own admissions against him, which were privileged communications, the\r\nmaking of which secured him protection from any action based upon such\r\nadmissions, was an indictable offence at the common law. But what made\r\nthings worse was that, when the Captain left the stand, he had been\r\naddressed in eulogistic terms by counsel. This was not without cause. His\r\ncandour in owning up and admitting everything had enabled the Committee to\r\npenetrate into the depths of the mystery of promotion by purchase. Mr.\r\nGoff had concluded his little speech by declaring that, “In view of\r\neverything; in view of your splendid service to your country, and your\r\ngood service on the Police Department, it is the unanimous expression of\r\nthe Committee that the public interests would not be served were you to be\r\ndisturbed in your present position as police captain” (p. 4,982).\r\n\r\nWithin an hour of this emphatic and public certificate of commendation,\r\nthe Police Board met and suspended Captain Creedon from duty. Not a single\r\ncaptain or police officer of all the black regiment of clubbers and\r\nblackmailers, whose infamy had been proved before the Committee, and who\r\nhad been indicted before the Grand Jury, had been removed from duty. Only\r\nwhen this honest officer had admitted the truth did they pounce down upon\r\nhim and make an example. It is only fair to say that the Board was not\r\naware when it suspended Creedon of the remarks that had been made by the\r\ncounsel of the Committee as he left the witness stand. When they were\r\nrebuked they restored him to his post. But even with this allowance, the\r\nfact that the Commissioners should have only made one suspension, and that\r\nof a man who had confessed and repented of his wrong-doing, while they\r\nleft all the other scoundrels unwhipped, was one of the most significant\r\nincidents in the whole course of the inquiry.\r\n\r\nBut after such an illustration of the methods of the Police Board, is it\r\nvery surprising that until the Lexow Committee sat the authorities were\r\nutterly unable to discover any specific evidence as to the corruption into\r\nwhich the whole force had sunk?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPTAIN CREEDON.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPTAIN MAX F. SCHMITTBERGER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A POLICE CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following narrative of the career of a police captain of the City of\r\nNew York is taken for the most part textually from the evidence tendered\r\non oath by Captain Max F. Schmittberger, then in command of the Nineteenth\r\nPrecinct. The police of New York were four thousand strong, divided for\r\npurposes of administration--and of plunder--into thirty-eight Precincts.\r\nSchmittberger was Captain of the Nineteenth. He gave his evidence almost\r\nat the close of the inquiry, when the essential facts were all proved up\r\nto the hilt by the evidence of a multitude of witnesses. Strange, almost\r\nincredible though it may appear that such an official should make so\r\nremarkable a confession, it is to be remembered that the facts were\r\nalready known, and the only chance he had of saving himself was by turning\r\nQueen’s evidence. When he took the stand under subpœna, the Chairman\r\naddressed him as follows:--\r\n\r\n    We are here on the great State service to ascertain not only\r\n    individual or specific cases of fraud or corruption, but the general\r\n    system, and any witness who places himself on the stand here, no\r\n    matter if he has himself been guilty of the violation of the law, if\r\n    he places himself under the protection of this Committee, to serve it,\r\n    to aid it in the ascertainment of those questions that the State\r\n    Senate has imposed upon us, we shall consider it not only our\r\n    obligation and our duty under the circumstances as Senators,\r\n    individually and collectively, to do all that we can to see that that\r\n    immunity which the law throws about you is safely guarded, but that he\r\n    shall hereafter be protected from any of those results that that\r\n    testimony might otherwise bring upon him.--Vol. v., pp. 5,311-2.\r\n\r\nThus adjured, Captain Schmittberger did on the 21st of December, 1894,\r\nunfold as remarkable a tale of infamy as ever was deposed on oath by an\r\nofficer supposed to be responsible for the enforcement of the law. When he\r\nhad closed his testimony, he said, “I have made a clean breast of\r\neverything I know.” Mr. Goff, who was examining him, asked:--\r\n\r\n    Is it not a fact that, owing to the developments before this Committee\r\n    showing the corrupt and rotten condition of affairs in the Police\r\n    Department, you feel justified in coming forward and stating all you\r\n    know for the benefit of the people of this city and of this State? The\r\n    Captain replied: “I feel that the pillars of the church are falling,\r\n    and have fallen, and I feel in justice to my wife and my children that\r\n    I should do this.”--Vol. v., p. 5,382.\r\n\r\nIn compiling his autobiography I quote, wherever possible, textually from\r\nhis own words, giving the reference in all important points to the page\r\nfrom which the quotation is taken.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE EVIDENCE OF CAPTAIN SCHMITTBERGER.\r\n\r\nI joined the police force when I was twenty-three years old, on January\r\n28th, 1874. I had previously been a confectioner. I was married when I was\r\nadmitted to the force. The Civil Service rules were not in operation then,\r\nneither had I to pay anything, for the practice of paying money for a\r\nposition in the force had not commenced so early as 1874.\r\n\r\nI was first assigned to the 19th Precinct, then the 29th, better known as\r\nthe “Tenderloin.” For three years I served as patrolman. In those years I\r\ndiscovered the importance of the political pull. The local politician, by\r\nhis influence with the Police Commissioners and the chief police\r\nauthorities, could generally make the sergeant his mouthpiece, and induce\r\nhim to give preference and show favours to patrolmen who were friends and\r\nsupporters of the politician. It was decidedly detrimental to discipline,\r\nbut it was the principle throughout. A sergeant who was seeking promotion\r\nrelied much more on his political pull than upon his record as a police\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nSenator O’Connor interrupted to ask:--\r\n\r\n    Is there any recognition of merit at all in the department as now\r\n    conducted, apart from money considerations or political influence?\r\n\r\nCaptain Schmittberger replied:--\r\n\r\n    To a very small extent. It is either politics or money.--Vol. v., p.\r\n    5,382.\r\n\r\nThe result has been that in the last ten years the police have\r\ndeteriorated. “They are more politicians than anything else” (p. 5,316).\r\nThe mischief of the political pull was increased when candidates had to\r\npay for their appointment. They felt they had purchased their positions,\r\nand were sort of independent.\r\n\r\nThe system of purchase, which did not exist in 1874, gradually became so\r\ngeneral that if men wanted to get into the department it was necessary to\r\nsee one of the “go-betweens,” a set of men of whom one Charley Grant,\r\nCommissioner McClave’s secretary, was very well known. These\r\npurchase-officers made poor policemen, and they felt they had a right to\r\nmore protection than the others. When they were rebuked for offences by\r\ntheir officers they would often defy them, basing their defiance upon the\r\nground of political influence and power to protect them from the\r\nconsequences of their act. This was especially the case with those men who\r\nbelonged to political organisations, political clubs.\r\n\r\nThere was the Pequod Club, for instance, a Tammany club, presided over by\r\nPolice Commissioner Sheehan, which I was pressed to join, owing to the\r\npull it would give me if I belonged to the Commissioner’s club. Several\r\npolice captains belonged to it, and the tickets for the club outings, at\r\nfive dollars apiece, were forced upon storekeepers and liquor dealers by\r\nthe police. They also compelled all the liquor dealers in the precinct to\r\nbuy Munzinger’s mineral waters, for Munzinger was secretary of the Pequod.\r\n\r\nIn the Tenderloin there were a great number of disorderly houses, which\r\nwere resorts for the criminals of the whole country, who came there to\r\nmeet prostitutes. That precinct of New York was the centre for the\r\ncriminal classes. No one interfered with them, it being perfectly well\r\nunderstood by the police that they were under protection, and they were\r\nunder protection because they paid money for protection directly to the\r\npolice captain of the precinct. This was necessary, because without his\r\nprotection the officers would have closed the house. If they had\r\ninterfered with a protected house, they would have been removed to another\r\nbeat. Even if outrages occurred they knew they were not to interfere, as\r\nthe houses had paid the captain for protection, and no interference was\r\npermitted. I heard once of an officer, of the name of Coleman, who was\r\nkilled in a disorderly house, and there never has been an inquest or an\r\narrest of any persons suspected of the crime, or any judicial inquiry\r\nwhatever touching the cause of that officer’s death (p. 5,328).\r\n\r\nI was raised to the rank of a roundsman in April, 1880, because I found\r\nCommissioner Whelan’s favourite dog, and I remained in the precinct till\r\nMarch 6th, 1883. During all that time the state of things was very bad.\r\nFrench women used to stand out in front of the railing in front of their\r\nhouses and pull every man in as he went through the street. When citizens\r\ncomplained, they got no satisfaction. On one occasion a citizen who\r\ncomplained was ordered out quick. There was a friction--a very large\r\none--between him and the Captain. It was even reported in the newspapers\r\nat the time that the Captain had threatened to club the complaining\r\ncitizen out of the precinct.\r\n\r\nDuring these early years I had a good record. I had arrested an important\r\nburglar, who had shot at me. I received honourable mention twice; I got\r\nthe medal of honour from the department, and also the gold and diamond\r\nmedal from the citizens of the precinct for raiding out the thieves there;\r\nI sent over 1,200 people to State prison whom I arrested myself in seven\r\nyears as a detective (pp. 5,383-4).\r\n\r\nSo it came to pass that in March, 1883, I was made sergeant. I remained as\r\nsergeant for seven years, when I was made captain. I had passed at the\r\nhead of the Civil Service list, and had some influential political men\r\nrecommending me. I paid nothing for my appointment.\r\n\r\nWhen I became captain I objected at first to the levying of blackmail. I\r\nwas appointed to the steamboat squad, and I had not been there any time\r\nwhen detective Vail told me that he collected money from the ship\r\ncompanies and dock occupants or lessees, and that my predecessors always\r\nreceived half. I told him I did not care about a thing of that kind. Vail\r\nreplied, “You’re a damned fool if you don’t do it; you might as well get\r\nit as well as the others” (p. 5,337). So I told him to go on and do the\r\ncollecting. He brought me 190 dollars a month, and I gave him 20 per cent.\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nAt this time, in the police department when I became captain, it was an\r\nunderstood thing, and a matter of common understanding among the captains\r\nof the various precincts, that they were to take advantage of any\r\nopportunity that presented itself to make money out of their respective\r\nprecincts (p. 5,337).\r\n\r\nI did it--we all did it. It was the universal custom. I had a list of the\r\nmen and the amounts they received. The wardman brought me half of it to\r\nthe station-house. I then returned him 20 per cent. It was a poor\r\ndistrict, and so I was not expected to send any of my share up to the\r\ninspector. He told me himself that he hardly expected anything, as there\r\nwasn’t anything in the precinct. That was true, and therefore I tried to\r\nget another as soon as possible. At the end of thirteen months I was\r\ntransferred to the Twenty-fifth Precinct. I brought with me my\r\nconfidential collector, Gannon the detective.\r\n\r\nWhen we settled down in the new station we discussed what collections\r\ncould be made. We found there was nothing, only the policy shops, of which\r\nthere were about ten, and the Liquor Dealers’ Association. There was no\r\ndifficulty about either.\r\n\r\nThe policy shops, all those in the precinct and in the upper part of the\r\ncity, are under a man by the name of Parker, and if I remember right,\r\nParker came to the station-house and saw me, and told me how many shops he\r\nhad in the precinct; that was all. He was introduced to Gannon, and Gannon\r\ndid the rest (p. 5,341). He fixed the old price that had been understood\r\nfor years long before my time--twenty dollars a month per shop. The\r\nBohemian Liquor Dealers’ Association were equally easy to manage. They\r\npaid eighty dollars per month.\r\n\r\nMy predecessor before he left had a talk with me about what should be\r\ngiven to the Inspector. He said he gave him usually from fifty to\r\nseventy-five dollars a month. He used to put the money in an envelope, and\r\ngive it to an officer, who would give it to the sergeant in Inspector\r\nWilliams’s office. I did not take this course. I went directly to Williams\r\nand handed him fifty dollars in an envelope. He took it in his office at\r\nheadquarters without a word (p. 5,343).\r\n\r\nI was three months in that precinct. I gave the Inspector a hundred\r\ndollars one month. It was necessary to square him because it was in\r\nWilliams’s power to send men up there to raid those policy shops over my\r\nhead; I had to prevent him from doing that. Of course, upon consideration\r\nof receiving that sum of money every month he wouldn’t do it (p. 5,344).\r\n\r\nI had also to pay 20 per cent. to my collector. In return for this money I\r\ngave protection to the policy shops, and allowed all the liquor dealers to\r\nrun open on Sunday. I was in the precinct three months, during which time\r\nI duly reported to headquarters concerning disorderly houses, gambling\r\nhouses, &c., in my precinct, but I was very careful to say nothing of the\r\nten policy shops which paid for protection. It was an understood thing the\r\nlaw was not to be enforced in the case of those who paid for protection.\r\n\r\nAfter three months I was changed to the Twenty-seventh Precinct. In that\r\nprecinct there were ten policy shops and three pool-rooms. I brought\r\nGannon along with me. The policy shops paid as before, but the pool-rooms\r\npaid two hundred dollars a month. This was the old tariff paid to my\r\npredecessor, and continued, as a matter of course. Besides the usual 20\r\nper cent. to the collector, I had to pay two hundred dollars per month to\r\nInspector Williams. During the nine months I was in the precinct I handed\r\nhim directly eighteen hundred dollars. He made no remark, and I would\r\nmerely say, “Here is something for you.” I gave him the same money I\r\nreceived from the pool-rooms. But in this precinct I drew no money from\r\nthe saloons. There had been some trouble with my predecessor, and it had\r\nbeen arranged that instead of paying the police the liquor dealers were,\r\nin future, to pay direct to Tammany Hall (p. 5,349).\r\n\r\nI was removed from this precinct because of the liquor dealers.\r\nSuperintendent Byrnes ordered me to make direct _bonâ fide_ excise arrests\r\nwhere liquor was sold on Sunday. I made over twenty _bonâ fide_ arrests.\r\nThe President of the Liquor Dealers threatened the officers to have them\r\ntransferred if they made real arrests, and he was as good as his word. I\r\nalso was transferred for the same cause. The liquor dealers pulled the leg\r\nof Commissioner Martin, who was a Tammany chief, and we were all\r\ntransferred. The Superintendent whose orders I obeyed could not protect\r\nus. He simply told me to keep quiet, that the thing would right itself.\r\n\r\nI was transferred to the Fifth Precinct, and there remained only nine\r\nweeks. There were only two pool-rooms, which yielded four hundred dollars\r\na month, of which I gave fifty dollars to Inspector McAvoy. I put the\r\nmoney in a blank envelope and left it on his desk at headquarters.\r\n\r\nFrom the Fifth I was removed to the Ninth, where I only remained a month.\r\nI made no collections there. But when I was removed to the Twenty-second I\r\nhad better fortune: I remained there from May to December. Here I first\r\nstruck disorderly houses. They paid--some ten, others twenty-five, and\r\nothers again as much as fifty dollars a month. The policy shops paid the\r\nusual twenty-dollar tariff. There I collected from five hundred to six\r\nhundred dollars per month. The gambling houses were all strictly closed\r\nup.\r\n\r\nIt was while I was in this precinct that I came across Commissioner\r\nMartin, who was protecting personally a house of ill-fame kept by Mrs.\r\nSadie West, 234, West Fifty-first Street. A body of citizens had made a\r\nformal complaint. I sent an officer down to make inquiries. Mrs. West\r\nsaid, “Commissioner Martin is a friend of mine, and don’t you do anything\r\nuntil you hear from him.” Next day Commissioner Martin, who was at the\r\nhead of the Police Board, ordered me to send the officer back to apologise\r\nand say he had made a mistake. “Hold on, Commissioner,” I said; “this\r\noriginates from a complaint of citizens.” “Well,” he replied, “I don’t\r\ncare; I want you to do what you are told.” So I had to send that officer\r\nback, and he had to apologise (p. 5,363).\r\n\r\nThat was not the only difficulty I had with the Commissioners.\r\nCommissioner Sheehan did his utmost to induce me to allow a gambling house\r\nto be opened in the precinct by one Maynard, a friend of his friend Mr.\r\nProctor. The capital which Proctor was to bring to the gambling house was\r\nhis pull with Sheehan--the Superintendent’s orders were strict. So I told\r\nSheehan, whom I met at the Pequod Club. Sheehan told me that there was a\r\nSpanish Club in that house, and I had no right to interfere with it; “if\r\nthey played cards among themselves without playing gambling games that I\r\nhad no right to interfere.” But the Superintendent said he would break me\r\nif I allowed cards to be played there. When I told Sheehan this he\r\nexclaimed, “Well, if they cannot play, Daly can’t play!” As a matter of\r\nfact Daly was not playing (p. 5,368).\r\n\r\nDuring my stay in this precinct I used to take one hundred and fifty\r\ndollars a month in a closed envelope and give it to Inspector McAvoy at\r\nheadquarters. One curious circumstance I remember about him. The Inspector\r\nis a very religious man, and he had conscientious scruples. He asked me\r\none time if some of the money I gave him came from disorderly houses; if\r\nit did he didn’t want it, because he didn’t want any money of that kind; I\r\ntold him no, it hadn’t; he drew the line there (p. 5,370).\r\n\r\nOf course as he had been captain in the precinct himself he knew that it\r\ndid come from disorderly houses, but he wished to be told it did not. I\r\nreported to headquarters that there were no disorderly houses in the\r\nprecinct.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1893, I was made Captain of the Tenderloin, and have been\r\nthere ever since. But the glory had departed owing to the raids made after\r\nDr. Parkhurst’s action. I did not get more than 200 dols. a month there.\r\nGeorgiana Hastings’s house of ill-fame I was warned not to touch, as if I\r\ndid I should burn my fingers. I was informed that certain public officials\r\nwere in the habit of visiting Georgiana Hastings’s house--some officials\r\nthat graced the Bench, and some officials that held commissions in the\r\nCity of New York. One night, when a Bench warrant was sent there for\r\nexecution, there were two officials, one a judge of a Court in this\r\ncity--not of a Civil Court--in the house, and so that warrant was not\r\nexecuted (p. 5,374). She paid no protection money. She was protected\r\ninviolate by the law on account of the influential character of her\r\ncustomers.\r\n\r\nLast year I made a political contribution of 100 dols. both to Mr. Martin\r\nand to Mr. Sheehan, who were both Police Commissioners and Tammany leaders\r\nin their respective districts. I had nothing much to do with handling\r\nmoney in payment for promotion. I acted as go-between in the case of\r\nMartens. I took 1,600 dols. of his to Captain Williams, and he got him\r\nmade sergeant. Martens afterwards told me it would cost him 14,000 dols.\r\nto be made captain. On the whole, I have been four years a police captain.\r\nIn that time I have been in command in six precincts, in every one of\r\nwhich I found the custom of collections regularly established from of old.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the tariff was fixed: the commission to the collectors,\r\nand the proportion for the Inspector. The figures were as follows:--\r\n\r\n                         Sources of       Collectors’               Total\r\n            Time of        Revenue           Com.

Without a word they\r\n    collected the illicit revenue, simplifying their duties as much as\r\n    they could, either by granting monopolies of a special kind of crime\r\n    to individuals, or imposing upon certain individuals who had knowledge\r\n    of a particular class of crime the obligation of collecting for them,\r\n    thus collecting monthly from all licensed vice and crime, and paying\r\n    over their collections to the captain, deducting for their services\r\n    twenty per cent. from the total. Or, rather, at first, paying the\r\n    whole to the captain, and receiving twenty per cent. back from him,\r\n    and thereafter making the deductions themselves. The captain, on his\r\n    side, visited the inspector and paid over to him a substantial\r\n    proportion of the amount collected.--Vol. i., pp. 45, 46.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CITIES WHERE DWELL THE STRANGERS WITHIN THE GATES. View\r\nof Brooklyn Bridge from a roof in Broadway.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n“THE STRANGER WITHIN THE GATES.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“I was a stranger and ye took me in.” The familiar passage needs to be\r\ninterpreted in a different sense if it is to describe the treatment of the\r\nstranger by the police of New York. In the evidence of the men who\r\npractise the confidence trick, the curious fact came out that the police\r\nexpressly abandoned strangers to the tender mercies of the Bunco Steerer\r\nand Green Goods dealer. These thieves were forbidden to practise their\r\narts upon the resident population of New York. But the “guy” was fair\r\ngame. The stranger from the country was abandoned to the plunderer, who\r\nindeed could count upon the active co-operation of the police--in return\r\nfor a share of the loot. The stranger was taken in indeed. But not in the\r\nsense of the Bible text.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of Americans who were strangers in the sense of not\r\npossessing a fixed abode within the city limits, was bad. The treatment of\r\nthe stranger from over sea, the foreign immigrant, was infinitely worse.\r\nIt has been the glory of Columbia, as one of the poets declared, that her\r\nlatchkey was never drawn in to the poorest and weakest of Adam’s kin. The\r\nboast is no longer true. Restrictions upon the pauper immigrants from the\r\nOld World have been multiplied of late with ominous rapidity. But the\r\nforeigner had already established himself by the million within the\r\nRepublic before the restrictive policy was begun.\r\n\r\nIn the Civil War, when the negroes were enrolled as soldiers in the\r\nFederal ranks, their presence was excused by the cynical remark that\r\nniggers were good enough food for powder. The foreign denizen of the New\r\nYork slums is regarded in much the same light by the police of the city.\r\nNot as food for powder, but as material for plunder--squeezable folk who\r\nhave no rights, save that of being allowed to swell the registration list\r\nof their oppressors. The police brigands levied blackmail boldly enough\r\neven when dealing with the cute Yankee and the smart New Yorker. But when\r\nthey were let loose on the foreigner their rapacity knew no bounds. They\r\nhad the power of a Turkish pasha in an Armenian province, and they used it\r\nalmost as ruthlessly. They did not massacre, it is true. There was no\r\noccasion for such extreme measures. Even the Turk would not slaughter his\r\ntaxable cattle if they were not guilty of indulging in aspirations after\r\nfreedom. No dream of revolt ever crosses the mind of the poor wretches in\r\nthe city slums to whom the policeman is the incarnate embodiment of the\r\nwhole American Constitution. Back of him stands the whole\r\nGovernment--City, State, and Federal. What he says goes. So the\r\nforeigner--poor, ignorant, friendless--can only obey.\r\n\r\nA witness before the Lexow Committee testified to the existence of a gang\r\nof criminals known as the Essex Market Gang, which had established a\r\nregular reign of terror in the neighbourhood. This witness, whose name was\r\nJohn Collins, said:--\r\n\r\n    Last night business people spoke to me; I live nineteen years in that\r\n    neighbourhood and begged of me to protect them; it is impossible to\r\n    live there with the gang; they can convict any man they want to, and\r\n    they can make free any man they want to, because they have got their\r\n    witnesses; the leading man is Martin Engel, he owns property over\r\n    200,000 dollars, got from ruining people.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Moss: You can see what power these men have when they have lots of\r\n    men swearing to anything, and police officers to make arrests, and\r\n    judges holding them and discharging them at will.\r\n\r\n    Chairman Lexow: If the situation is such as indicated, how is it there\r\n    has not been a revolt down there?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Moss: The class of people are largely those who have come from\r\n    foreign countries--countries where they have been used to that sort of\r\n    thing, and supposed this Government just about the same, and, perhaps,\r\n    a little worse than the place they came from; they are largely Polish\r\n    Jews and Russian Jews and foreigners of that class, who have small\r\n    understanding of the English language and no knowledge of our custom.\r\n    Those are the class of people that are terrorised by this gang.--Vol.\r\n    v., p. 4,896.\r\n\r\nIn small things as in great, the helplessness of the poor foreigner is\r\nconspicuous. Here is an instance of the way in which an Italian shoeblack\r\nwas treated for daring to ask an officer, whose boots he had blacked on\r\ncredit for a month until the little bill had run up to 75 cents, to settle\r\nup. The bootblack, whose name was Martini, stopped the officer, whose name\r\nwas Gwinnen, as he was passing their stand, and said:--\r\n\r\n    “Gwinnen, why don’t you pay what you owe me?” so he said, “The next\r\n    time you stop me on my way going across the street, I will smash you\r\n    on the jaw, you dirty Italian son-of-a-bitch;” at the same time my\r\n    partner got up and said, “Well, why don’t you pay us?” At the same\r\n    time he rushed up against my partner like a cyclone and struck him\r\n    right and left with his hand; and he had him all bleeding. I tried to\r\n    step in between the two of them to separate them, and this officer\r\n    Looney came along from behind me and he grabbed me by the back of the\r\n    neck and punched me between the eyes, and he said, “Let us pull the\r\n    guinea in.”\r\n\r\n    Q. Whom did he mean by the guinea?\r\n\r\n    A. Well, he meant us two; so we went to the station-house, and they\r\n    made a charge of disorderly conduct: they claimed that we were\r\n    fighting each other, me and my partner.\r\n\r\n    Q. And both of you were cut and bleeding at this time?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n    Q. Were the officers in uniform?\r\n\r\n    A. All in uniform. When they went into the station-house they told\r\n    their story, and when I went to tell my story, they wouldn’t listen.\r\n    They heard the policeman’s story, but would not let us tell ours at\r\n    all. Another officer took me to the court, and Gwinnen took my partner\r\n    along; when we got to the other side of the station-house,\r\n    Sixty-seventh and Lexington Avenue, this Gwinnen took off his belt,\r\n    doubled it in two, and struck my partner in the face two or three\r\n    times.\r\n\r\n    Q. You were then under arrest?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n    Q. And on your way to the police-court?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir; I appealed to the officer that had me, and I said,\r\n    “Officer, tell him that he should not hit him any more;” so after he\r\n    turned around my partner was a sight.--Vol. iv., pp. 3576-7.\r\n\r\nThe sequel of this episode is interesting. The judge, apparently thinking\r\nthe poor wretches who were brought before him all bloody had had enough of\r\nit, dismissed the case. Strange to say, the victims in this case\r\nendeavoured to obtain redress. They appealed to the Superintendent, who\r\npromised that the officers should be punished. Nothing was done. They then\r\nmade another effort, raised £5 to pay a lawyer, and began an action for\r\nassault. One officer was held for the Grand Jury. But it was postponed\r\nagain and again. The lawyer insisted on more money, which was not\r\nforthcoming, and so the Italians lost their £5, had their beating, and do\r\nnot even appear to have recovered their 75 cents.\r\n\r\nThe lesson thus taught, not to throw good money after bad, and the\r\nimpossibility of getting justice of a policeman, has been learned so well\r\nthat one marvels at the temerity of the brave bootblacks, whose courage\r\ndeserved a better fate.\r\n\r\nThe Lexow Committee in their Report put it on record as their deliberate\r\nconclusion that--\r\n\r\n    The poor ignorant foreigner residing on the great east side of the\r\n    city has been especially subjected to a brutal and infamous rule by\r\n    the police, in conjunction with the administration of the local\r\n    inferior criminal courts, so that it is beyond a doubt that innocent\r\n    people who have refused to yield to criminal extortion, have been\r\n    clubbed and harassed and confined in gaol, and the extremes of\r\n    oppression have been applied to them in the separation of parent and\r\n    child, the blasting of reputation and consignment of innocent persons\r\n    to a convict’s cell.--Vol. i.\r\n\r\nThe case which appears to have produced the deepest impression for wanton\r\nwickedness and ingenious devilry on the minds of the Commissioners was the\r\nattempt to plunder an unfortunate widow woman of the name of Urchittel.\r\nMrs. Urchittel was a Russian Jewess, who emigrated to the United States in\r\n1891. Her husband had died at Hamburg, from which city she sailed for New\r\nYork, where she arrived, accompanied by her four children, the eldest of\r\nwhom was fourteen, the youngest three. But it is best to print in her own\r\nsimple language the statement of her wrongs:--\r\n\r\n    In 1891 I came to New York, a widow with four children; my husband\r\n    died in Hamburg. Being without means, I applied to the Hebrew\r\n    charities on Eighth Street for help, and they were kind enough to\r\n    support me for starting a boarding-house in 166 Division Street, and\r\n    gave me for furniture and other necessaries, and, besides 60 dollars,\r\n    sent immigrants to my boarding-house. My business was increasing\r\n    daily, having thirty to thirty-five persons every week, and in eight\r\n    months I saved 600 dollars. I worked hard indeed, but I did it gladly,\r\n    knowing that this will enable me to support my children, the orphans.\r\n\r\n    The immigration having been stopped, I had to give up boarding\r\n    business, and applying again to the Charities, they supported me\r\n    again, giving me 150 dollars, and sent me to Brownsville, where I\r\n    bought a restaurant and made a nice living, but having the misfortune\r\n    to lose one of my beloved children, I left Brownsville, after staying\r\n    there but a little time, and came back to New York.\r\n\r\n    I bought a cigar store in 33, Pitt Street, corner of Broome, for 175\r\n    dollars, and gave the landlord 40 dollars security, and supplied more\r\n    goods for 50 dollars. On the second day of my taking possession of the\r\n    store a man came in and bought a package of chew tobacco for five\r\n    cents. A couple of days later the same man came in, asking me for a\r\n    package of chew tobacco, to trust him, which I refused, excusing\r\n    myself being recently the owner of that store; I don’t know anybody of\r\n    that surrounding. I cannot do it. He took then out a dollar of his\r\n    pocket and gave it to me for changing, and having no small change,\r\n    only pennies, which he wouldn’t take, I sent my one-year aged daughter\r\n    to get other coin for the dollar, and handing same to the man I felt a\r\n    tickling in my hand caused by the quarter of the dollar in the hand of\r\n    the man, and I said good-bye to him.\r\n\r\n    On the evening of that day another man came in the store, and told me\r\n    that the man who was before asking for chew tobacco without money is a\r\n    detective, and that he has a warrant to arrest me, and I can avoid the\r\n    trouble by giving the detective 50 dollars, and refusing to do it, I\r\n    will be locked up, and my children taken away from me till the\r\n    twenty-first year. Not knowing to have done anything wrong, I laughed\r\n    at the man, and told him that I wouldn’t give a cent to anybody, and\r\n    if that man should come in again, I will chase him out with a broom.\r\n\r\n    The other night, at 11 o’clock, the children being asleep already, the\r\n    same man who asked me to trust him the chew tobacco, and after which I\r\n    learned he was a detective, named Hussey, came in with another man who\r\n    took away my cousin that came to see me in that night, and the\r\n    detective remained with me alone in the store; he told me then that he\r\n    knows that I keep a disorderly house and saved 600 dollars of that\r\n    dishonest business. If I wanted to escape being arrested, he wanted 50\r\n    dollars. I opposed to his assertion, and protested against his wanting\r\n    money of me, saying that I ever made a living by honest business, but\r\n    he wouldn’t listen to me, and in spite of my protesting and the crying\r\n    of my children, I was forced to leave my store and follow him.\r\n\r\n    As we were two blocks away we met Mr. Hochstein, and crying, I told\r\n    him all my trouble, and how I don’t know anything about the false\r\n    accusations. It was of no avail; Mr. Hochstein told me that the\r\n    detective wants 75 dollars, but he will try to settle it with 50\r\n    dollars, but without any money nothing can be done for me, and gave me\r\n    also his advice, to pay 10 dollars monthly to the detective I wouldn’t\r\n    be troubled at all, and that I should resume my business unhindered. I\r\n    repeated again that I don’t know anything about dishonest business,\r\n    but it was no use talking more.\r\n\r\n    I was dragged from corner to corner till three o’clock in the morning,\r\n    insisting that I had money with me, 600 dollars I kept it in my\r\n    stockings. Weary and tired out, I sat down at the corner of Essex and\r\n    Rivington Streets at a dry goods store and took off my stockings,\r\n    showing that I had no money in them. “If you don’t want to give the\r\n    money,” said the detective to me, “I can’t help it, you must follow me\r\n    to the station-house.” Being convinced that it is impossible that I\r\n    should escape without giving money, I took out 25 dollars of my\r\n    pocket, the only money I had, and handed them over to the detective\r\n    standing by a window, which money was parted between Mr. Hochstein and\r\n    himself, he taking 13 dollars and Hochstein 12 dollars.\r\n\r\n    They went with me to Essex Street, and, sending me in through a gate\r\n    in the house, where I was kept about two minutes, they sent me home\r\n    after with the warning to be prepared with fifty dollars. At seven\r\n    o’clock in the morning the detective, Hussey, came to my store asking\r\n    for the money. I cried again and begged him to let me go, that I am\r\n    not able to give him any more money; but he didn’t want to hear me any\r\n    more, and I had to follow him. By the signal of a whistle a man came\r\n    near me, and the defective gave me over to him with the remark not to\r\n    let me go till I have the fifty dollars. The name of that man is Mr.\r\n    Meyer. I went with him to Mr. Lefkovitz, manufacturer of syrups, 154,\r\n    Delaney Street, and to Mr. Frank ---- for selling the store even for\r\n    the fifty dollars, but they didn’t want to buy it, seeing the man\r\n    after me and fearing trouble. After trying in vain to sell the store\r\n    the detective said to Mr. Meyer, “That bad woman don’t want to give\r\n    the money. Take her to the court,” and I had to stay at the trial.\r\n\r\n    Two bad, disreputed boys were engaged by the detective, Hussey, for\r\n    witness. The one said that he gave me fifty cents for gratifying him,\r\n    and the other said that he would give me forty cents, and I did not\r\n    agree asking fifty, and thus I was detained in default of five\r\n    hundred dollars bail. Having been sitting in the court the detective,\r\n    Hussey, came in to me on the same day at four o’clock P.M., and told\r\n    me that my children are already taken away from my house, and if I can\r\n    give him the fifty dollars he can help me even now.\r\n\r\n    Hearing the distress of my poor children, I cried loudly, and a lady\r\n    took me to a dark room, where I was locked up. Unable to procure bail,\r\n    I was imprisoned for three days, and sent after to the Tombs, where I\r\n    had to stand trial.\r\n\r\n    There were about fifty persons to witness that I had always made an\r\n    honest living, but they were not asked at all, and being wholly unable\r\n    to understand the English language, I couldn’t defend myself. The\r\n    lawyer, who was sent from the Hebrew Charities, came too late, and had\r\n    to give only the certificate of the society, testifying that I was\r\n    supported by them, and led a decent living. It came too late, and I\r\n    could not talk any more.\r\n\r\n    I was fined fifty dollars. My brother sold my store for sixty-five\r\n    dollars, and paid the fine.\r\n\r\n    I ran then crazy for my children, for I didn’t know where they were.\r\n    Meeting the detective he told me that they are in the hands of a\r\n    society in Twenty-third Street. I ran there, but no one knew of my\r\n    children. Finally, after five weeks, I received a postcard of my\r\n    child, that the children are at One Hundred and Fifty-first Street and\r\n    Eleventh Avenue, and when I got there, and begged to give me back my\r\n    children, none would hear me.\r\n\r\n    Grieved at the depths of my heart, seeing me bereaved of my dear\r\n    children, I fell sick, and was laying six months in the Sixty-sixth\r\n    Street hospital, and had to undergo a great operation by Professor\r\n    Mundy. After I left the hospital, I had the good chance to find a\r\n    place in 558, Broadway, where I fixed up a stand by which I am enabled\r\n    to make a nice living, to support and educate my children. I went\r\n    again to Twenty-third Street, begging to release my children, and that\r\n    was denied again. My heart craves to have my children with me.\r\n\r\n    I have nothing else in the world only them. I want to live, and to die\r\n    for them. I lay my supplication before you, honourable sir, father of\r\n    family, whose heart beats for your children, and feels what children\r\n    are to a faithful mother. Help me to get my children. Let me be mother\r\n    to them. Grant me my holy wish, and I will always pray for your\r\n    happiness, and will never forget your kind and benevolent act towards\r\n    me. Your very humble and faithful servant, (Signed) CAELA\r\n    URCHITTEL.--Vol. iii., pp. 2, 961-4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. URCHITTEL.]\r\n\r\nThe piteous plea of this bereaved mother produced a great effect upon the\r\nmind of the Committee. The children had been taken away by the Society for\r\nthe Prevention of Cruelty to Children, under an Act which had been passed\r\nwith the best intentions in the world, but which, as the case of Mrs.\r\nUrchittel showed, was only too facile an instrument in the hands of the\r\ncorrupt police. It will be noticed that in her evidence she said that “two\r\nbad, disreputed boys” were engaged to swear away her character. The\r\nallusion was a reminder of the fact that one of the worst developments of\r\nthe system under which the police became bandits was the organisation of a\r\nband of professional perjurers, who would swear anything the police cared\r\nto tell them. Mrs. Urchittel’s character was irreproachable, yet on the\r\nevidence of these scoundrels she was convicted of keeping a house of\r\nprostitution. The man Hochstein, who divided the plunder with the\r\ndetective, was a saloon-keeper, and a prominent politician in the\r\ndistrict, who figures very conspicuously in the evidence of other\r\nwitnesses before the Committee. No sooner had Mrs. Urchittel given her\r\nevidence than two men came to her and warned her that if she were to\r\ncommence with Mr. Hochstein she would get into trouble, and be sent to\r\nprison for two years.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of the Commissioners to secure the return of the children to\r\ntheir distracted mother were for a time thwarted by the provisions of the\r\nlaw which is so hidebound and imperative in its terms that no judge would\r\nventure to interfere with the commitment of the police magistrate. Mr.\r\nGoff called attention to the fact that “the condition of the law in New\r\nYork City is that, upon the _ipse dixit_ of one man, children can be taken\r\nfrom their protectors, fathers and mothers, and secreted away in some\r\ninstitution, and there is no power invested in any court or in any\r\nofficial to compel him to reveal where the children are or to restore\r\nthem.” The sensation occasioned by this case was so great that the\r\nCommission were able towards the close of their sittings to announce the\r\ngratifying intelligence that they had at last succeeded in securing the\r\nrelease of the children, who were then, after more than eighteen months,\r\nhanded over to their mother. The opinion of the Commissioners on the case\r\nwas embodied in the following terms, which I quote from their Report:--\r\n\r\n    Oppression of the lowly and unfortunate, the coinage of money out of\r\n    the miseries of life, is one of the noteworthy abuses into which the\r\n    department has fallen....\r\n\r\n    The evidence of many witnesses shows the existence of a wonderful\r\n    conspiracy in the neighbourhood of Essex Market police-court, headed\r\n    by politicians, including criminals, professional bondsmen,\r\n    professional thieves, police, and those who lay plots against the\r\n    unwary, and lead them into habits of law-breaking, or surround them\r\n    with a network of false evidence, and then demand money as the price\r\n    of salvation, and if they do not receive it, drag their victims into\r\n    court and prison, and often to a convict’s cell....\r\n\r\n    In another case, Mrs. Urchittel, a humble Russian Jewess, ignorant of\r\n    our tongue, an honest and impoverished widow with three small\r\n    children, whom she was striving to support, was falsely accused by a\r\n    precinct detective of keeping a disorderly house in the back room of\r\n    her little store where she and her little children slept, and he\r\n    demanded a sum of money which she could not pay, whereupon he took her\r\n    from her home, dragged her through the streets until three o’clock in\r\n    the morning, pulled down and searched her stockings for money, until\r\n    she in despair produced all that she had saved for her month’s rent.\r\n    This being insufficient, he gave her a short time to obtain the\r\n    balance, and she tried to sell her store, but failed, and then he\r\n    arrested her again, lodged a false and infamous charge against her,\r\n    fastened it upon her by the testimony of miserable tools whom he had\r\n    employed for the purpose, and secured her conviction. Her children\r\n    passed into the hands of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to\r\n    Children. Her fine was paid by selling her store, and she was\r\n    released, only to fall into a severe and lingering illness. When she\r\n    recovered her home was gone, her children were gone, and she was\r\n    penniless.\r\n\r\n    Many cases of similar oppression are found on the record.--Vol. i.,\r\n    pp. 43, 44.\r\n\r\nIs it any wonder that the Lexow Committee reported under the head of\r\n“Brutality,” as it existed in the police force:--\r\n\r\n    This condition has grown to such an extent that even in the eyes of\r\n    our foreign-born residents our institutions have been degraded, and\r\n    those who have fled from oppression abroad have come here to be doubly\r\n    oppressed in a professedly free and liberal country.--Vol. i., p. 30.\r\n\r\nThis is how “Liberty enlightens the world” from her eyrie in the Island of\r\nManhattan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUGUSTINE E. COSTELLO.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE SLAUGHTER-HOUSES OF THE POLICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSaid Mr. Goff at one of the sittings of the Lexow Committee:--\r\n\r\n    We have, Mr. Chairman, called attention heretofore to what may be\r\n    justly termed “slaughter-houses,” known as police-stations, where\r\n    prisoners in custody of the officers of the law, and under the law’s\r\n    protection, have been brutally kicked and maltreated, almost within\r\n    view of the judge presiding in the Court.--Vol. iv., p. 3,598.\r\n\r\nSlaughter-houses is not a bad term. The cases in which witnesses swore to\r\nviolent assault on prisoners in the cells by policemen were numerous. That\r\nwhich immediately provoked this observation was a typical one of its kind.\r\n\r\nOne Frank Prince, who had been keeping a disorderly house in Ninety-eighth\r\nStreet, had the temerity to refuse to pay the 100 dollars a month\r\nblackmail which had been demanded by the police. His house was raided, and\r\nhe was taken to the station-house. He was accused before the Captain of\r\nhaving said that he would make him close the other disorderly house in the\r\ndistrict, which presumably was under the Captain’s protection. Now not to\r\npay blackmail yourself was bad enough; but it was far worse to threaten to\r\ndry up the contributory sources of police revenue. The poor wretch denied\r\nthat he had ever uttered such a threat. “Take him into the cell and attend\r\nto him!” said the Captain. Prince was marched out by the wardman, who was\r\nalso blackmail collector for the precinct. When they reached the cell, the\r\nturnkey and the wardman kicked him through the doorway, and then following\r\nhim in fell to beating him about the head with a policeman’s billy. They\r\nkicked him violently in the abdomen, inflicting permanent injuries, and\r\ndeclared he deserved to have his brains knocked out. Such was the\r\n“attendance” prisoners received in the police cell to teach them the\r\nheinousness of refusing to pay ransom to the banditti of New York. This\r\ncase by no means stood alone.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable case of police brutality to prisoners under arrest,\r\nand which is one the best attested in the collection, is that of the Irish\r\nrevolutionist, Mr. Augustine E. Costello.\r\n\r\nThe story of Mr. Costello was wrung from him very reluctantly. He was\r\nsubpœnaed on behalf of the State, and confronted with the alternative of\r\nbeing committed for contempt of Court or of being committed for perjury.\r\nMr. Costello, being a revolutionary Irishman, had a morbid horror of doing\r\nanything which could in any way lead any one to accuse him, no matter how\r\nfalsely, of being an informer. The prejudice against the witness-box often\r\nappears to be much stronger on the part of Irish Nationalists than the\r\nprejudice against the dock. Mr. Augustine E. Costello is an honourable man\r\nof the highest character and the purest enthusiasm. He was one of those\r\nIrishmen who, loving their country not wisely but too well, crossed the\r\nAtlantic for the purpose of righting the wrongs of Ireland. His zeal\r\nbrought him into collision with the Coercionist Government that was then\r\nsupreme. He was convicted and sentenced to twelve years’ penal servitude.\r\nHe was a political offender, the American Government intervened on his\r\nbehalf, and the treaty known as the Warren and Costello Treaty was\r\nnegotiated, which led to his liberation before his sentence had expired.\r\nDuring his incarceration in this country he was confined in several\r\nprisons, both in England and Ireland, and thus had a fair opportunity of\r\nforming a first-hand estimate of the interior of British gaols and the\r\nseverity of our prison discipline. He was treated, he reported, with a\r\ngreat deal of rigour, but he was never punished without warrant of law,\r\nand was never pounded or assaulted. It is characteristic of the Irish\r\npolitical convict that, when Mr. Costello was asked about this before the\r\nLexow Committee, he carefully inquired whether his answers would more or\r\nless justify “the people on the other side,” and it was only on being\r\nassured that it would do no such thing that he reluctantly admitted that\r\nhe had never experienced as a convict in British gaols anything like the\r\nbrutality with which he had been treated by the New York police.\r\n\r\nMr. Costello’s story, in brief, is this. About ten or a dozen years ago he\r\nwas on the staff of the _New York Herald_. By his commission he was\r\nattached to the police headquarters, in which capacity he was necessarily\r\nbrought into the closest relations with captains and inspectors. He\r\ndischarged his duties with satisfaction to his employers, and without any\r\ncomplaint on the part of the police. Two lawyers of good standing, who\r\nwere called as witnesses, testified that they had known him for years as a\r\nthoroughly honourable man, a newspaper man of talent and ability; one\r\nwhose word they would take as soon as that of the President of the United\r\nStates. Every one who knew him spoke in the highest terms of his veracity\r\nand scrupulous regard for accuracy.\r\n\r\nMr. Costello in 1885 conceived the idea of publishing a book about the\r\npolice under the title of “Our Police Protectors.” His idea was to hand\r\nover 80 per cent. of the profits of the work to the Police Pension Fund,\r\nretaining 20 per cent. as compensation for his work. The book at first was\r\nvery successful. The police sold it for the benefit of the Pension Fund,\r\nand the profits were duly paid over by him to the fund in question. But\r\njust as the book was beginning to boom, the Superintendent of Police\r\nbrought out a book of his own, entitled “The Great Criminals of New York.”\r\nNo sooner had it appeared than the police withdrew all their support from\r\nMr. Costello’s book, declared they had nothing to do with it officially,\r\nand left him stranded with the unsold copies on his hands. Mr. Costello\r\nappears to have regarded this as natural under the circumstances. He\r\nentered no complaint of the way in which he had been treated over “Our\r\nPolice Protectors” by the department, for whose Pension Fund the book was\r\nearning money, but at once set himself with a good heart to bring out\r\nanother book of a similar character about the Fire Department.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOURTEENTH STREET, NEW YORK.]\r\n\r\nMr. Croker, who was then a Fire Commissioner, and his two colleagues gave\r\nMr. Costello a letter certifying that the Fire Department had consented to\r\nthe publication of his history in consideration of his undertaking to pay\r\ninto the Fire Relief Fund a certain portion of the proceeds of the sale of\r\nthe book, for the publication of which Mr. Costello had been given access\r\nto the records of the department. Armed with this letter, Mr. Costello set\r\nto work. He printed 2,500 copies of the book, with 900 illustrations. The\r\nbook itself was bulky, containing as many as 1,100 pages, and costing\r\nnearly £5,000 to produce, an expenditure which he had incurred entirely on\r\nreliance upon the support of the Fire Department promised him in the\r\nletter written by Mr. Croker and his fellow commissioners. But again an\r\nadverse fate befell the unfortunate Costello. Just as the book was\r\nbeginning to boom, another man named Craig, who had a pull at the Fire\r\nheadquarters, got out a very cheap book, called the “Old Fire Laddies,”\r\nwhich he ran in opposition to Mr. Costello’s expensive work. The Fire\r\nofficials backed the man with a pull against Mr. Costello, who had no\r\npull. Friction arose, and the Fire Department withdrew the official letter\r\non the strength of which Mr. Costello had gone into the work.\r\n\r\nBut the power of the pull was to make itself felt in a still more painful\r\nfashion. Mr. Costello had several agents canvassing for orders for the\r\nbook, and for advertisements. He did his best to obtain from those agents\r\nthe Croker letter, and succeeded in doing so in all but two or three\r\ncases. As he had already spent his money, the only thing he could do was\r\nto continue to push his book. His agents, no doubt, when canvassing made\r\nas much capital as they could out of the credentials which Mr. Costello\r\nhad originally received from the Fire Department. This was resented, and\r\nit seems to have been decided to “down” Costello. The method adopted was\r\ncharacteristic. The Fire Commissioners and the Police were two branches of\r\nTammany administration. When Mr. Costello’s canvassers were going about\r\ntheir business, they were subjected to arrest. He had as many as\r\nhalf-a-dozen of his canvassers arrested at various times. They were seized\r\nby the police on one pretext and another, locked up all night in the\r\npolice cell, and then liberated the next morning, without any charge being\r\nmade against them. The application of this system of arbitrary arrest\r\neffected its purpose. The terrorised canvassers refused to seek orders any\r\nlonger for Mr. Costello’s book. One or two, however, still persevered. In\r\nNovember, 1888, two of them, who had retained the original certificate,\r\nwere arrested in the First Precinct at the instance of Captain Murray of\r\nthe Fire Department, who said that they were professing to be connected\r\nwith the Fire Department, with which they had nothing to do.\r\n\r\nMr. Costello, accompanied by his book-keeper, Mr. Stanley, went down to\r\nthe police-station to endeavour to bail his canvassers out. Mr. Costello\r\nhad no fear for himself, as he believed Captain McLaughlin was his\r\nfriend--a friendship based upon the Captain’s belief that Mr. Costello’s\r\ninfluence had counted for something in securing his captaincy. Mr.\r\nCostello complained of the repeated arrests, and declared that he would\r\nnot let it occur again if he could help it. Captain McLaughlin showed him\r\nthe books that had been taken from the imprisoned canvassers, in one of\r\nwhich there was a loose paper containing the memorandum of sales made on\r\nthat day, and a copy of the Croker letter. Mr. Costello at once took\r\npossession of the letter, which he had been trying to call in for some\r\ntime. He showed it to the Captain, and then put it in his pocket, telling\r\nthe Captain that if it was wanted, he would produce it in court the next\r\nday. The Captain made no objection, and they parted, apparently on\r\nfriendly terms.\r\n\r\nMr. Costello had supper, and then went off to the police-headquarters at\r\nseven o’clock, in order to secure an order for the release of his\r\ncanvassers. Suspecting nothing, he walked straight into the office, where\r\nhe found himself confronted by Inspector Williams. This Inspector was\r\nfamous for two things: he had the repute of being the champion clubber of\r\nthe whole force, and it was he also who first gave the _soubriquet_ of\r\n“Tenderloin” to the worst precinct in New York. The origin of this phrase\r\nwas said to be a remark made by Inspector Williams on his removal from the\r\nFourth to the Twenty-ninth Precinct. Williams, who was then captain, had\r\nsaid, “I have been living on rump-steak in the Fourth Precinct; I shall\r\nhave some tender loin now.” Mr. Costello picked up this phrase, applied it\r\nto the Twenty-ninth Precinct, coupling it with Williams’s name. Williams\r\nnever forgave Costello for this, and on one occasion had clubbed him in\r\nMadison Square.\r\n\r\nWhen Costello saw the Inspector, he felt there was a storm brewing, for\r\nWilliams was in one of his usual domineering moods. The moment Mr.\r\nCostello entered, the Inspector accused him of stealing a document out of\r\nCaptain McLaughlin’s office, and detained him for five hours. It was in\r\nvain that Mr. Costello explained that the document which he had sent home\r\nby his book-keeper, and placed in his safe, was his property, and would be\r\nproduced in court when it was wanted. During the five hours that he stayed\r\nthere he noticed what he described as “very funny work” going on. The\r\nInspector was telephoning here and there; detectives were coming in and\r\nwhispering, as if receiving secret orders; and at last, at midnight, two\r\ndetectives came in and whispered a message to the Inspector. Thereupon\r\nWilliams turned to Costello, ordered him to accompany the detectives, and\r\nconsider himself under arrest. A foreboding of coming trouble crossed\r\nCostello’s mind. He asked his book-keeper to accompany him, as he felt\r\nthat there was something going to happen, and he wanted him to be an\r\neye-witness. This, however, did not suit his custodians. On their way down\r\nto the police-station one of the detectives said to Stanley, “You get\r\naway! We do not want you at all.” Costello said, “Well, if you have to go,\r\nyou might look up Judge Duffy. I may want his services as well as these\r\nmen.” Stanley left, and Costello, with the two detectives, made his way to\r\nthe police-station.\r\n\r\nIt was getting on to one o’clock in the morning. Costello was carrying an\r\numbrella, as it was raining, when they came in front of the station-house.\r\nThe door was wide open, and the light streamed on to the sidewalk. Just as\r\nhe was placing his foot on the step he saw two men come towards him. The\r\nbright light cast a shadow, and in that shadow he saw Captain McLaughlin\r\nraise his fist and deal a savage blow at his face. He instinctively drew\r\nback his head, and the Captain’s brass-knuckled fist struck him on the\r\ncheek-bone, knocking him down into the gutter. The detectives stood by,\r\nindifferent spectators of the scene. As Costello lay half-stunned and\r\nbleeding in the muddy gutter, Captain McLaughlin attempted to kick him\r\nseveral times in his face. Fortunately, his victim had retained hold of\r\nhis umbrella, and with its aid was able to keep the Captain’s heavy boots\r\nfrom kicking him into insensibility.\r\n\r\nHe struggled to his feet, when Captain McLaughlin went for him again. What\r\nfollowed is best told by the transcript from the evidence before the Lexow\r\nCommittee:--\r\n\r\n    Augustine E. Costello examined by Mr. Moss. I said to Captain\r\n    McLaughlin:--“Now, hold on; I am a prisoner here; this is a cowardly\r\n    act on your part; if I have done anything to offend the laws of the\r\n    State there is another way of punishing me; this is not right.” You\r\n    could hardly recognise me as a human being at this time; I was covered\r\n    with blood, mud, and dirt, and had rolled over and over again in\r\n    trying to escape the kicks that were rained at me. I hurried myself as\r\n    fast as I could into the station-house, thinking that would protect\r\n    me; all this time I was being assaulted, the two detectives stood over\r\n    me.\r\n\r\n    Q. What were their names?\r\n\r\n    A. I cannot recall it just now, but I can get their names later on;\r\n    two wardmen of that precinct; there was a second man with the man who\r\n    assaulted me; that man, I may tell you, was Captain McLaughlin.\r\n\r\n    Q. What do you mean; on the sidewalk?\r\n\r\n    A. On the sidewalk; the man with him, standing right off the kerbstone\r\n    on the street; and when I got into the station-house, I asked to be\r\n    allowed to wash the blood off myself, and I was feeling more like a\r\n    wild beast than a human being.\r\n\r\n    By Mr. Moss:--Tell us what he did?\r\n\r\n    A. McLaughlin put himself in all sorts of attitudes and tried to\r\n    strike me, and I dodged the blows.\r\n\r\n    Q. Was that in the general room of the station-house?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes. Captain Murray, of the Fire Department, was present at the\r\n    time; he made the complaint against the two men.\r\n\r\n    Q. You were a prisoner, and standing in the middle of the\r\n    station-house floor while McLaughlin was raining blows at you?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes. “Now,” I said to him, “McLaughlin, look here, I never felt\r\n    myself placed in the position that I do to-night; no man has ever done\r\n    to me what you did to-night, and I advise you to let up. Standing\r\n    here, if I am assaulted again, you or I will have to die; one man of\r\n    two will be taken out of this station-house dead, and so, stop.” At\r\n    this time I had my fighting blood up, and had recovered from the\r\n    collapse I was thrown into. I said, “You may think me not protected\r\n    here; but I have a good strong arm, and if you assault me again, as\r\n    sure as there is a God in Heaven, I will never take my hands from your\r\n    throat until you kill me or I kill you.” He kept on blustering, but\r\n    never struck me again.\r\n\r\n    Q. What was the nature of the punishment?\r\n\r\n    A. He had brass-knuckled me.--(Vol. iv., p. 4,527).\r\n\r\n    Q. You say he desisted at that moment?\r\n\r\n    A. He desisted at that moment when I said he or I would have to die if\r\n    he did not stop. I was then allowed to go into his private room and\r\n    wash some of the mud and gutter off my face and hands. I could not\r\n    wash the blood off, because that was coming down in torrents; and when\r\n    I was going downstairs, somebody kicked me or punched me severely in\r\n    the back, and I feel the effects of it yet at times, and I suppose I\r\n    always will. Then I was thrown into a cell bleeding, and by this time\r\n    a second collapse had come over me, and I must have fainted in the\r\n    cell.\r\n\r\n    Q. Did McLaughlin go into the cell?\r\n\r\n    A. No; he came down after me, after I was locked up, and made it clear\r\n    he gloried in the fact that I was in that condition. So, fearing that\r\n    some one would open the cell door during the night, when I would be in\r\n    a faint--because I felt very weak from the loss of blood--I took out\r\n    my note-book and wrote in it, “If I am found dead here to-morrow, I\r\n    want it known I am murdered by Captain McLaughlin and his crowd.” I\r\n    hid that in my stocking, that piece of bloody paper. I kept it for a\r\n    long time, and I tried to find it to-day, but could not put my hands\r\n    on it, and am very sorry I cannot put my hands on it.\r\n\r\n    Q. Were you persecuted any more that night?\r\n\r\n    A. I was persecuted in a way that they would not give me any water.\r\n\r\n    Q. Did you call for water?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, and it was denied me; everything was denied me. From loss of\r\n    blood and all that I became unconscious; and about five o’clock in the\r\n    morning, when I could get a little rest, I was routed out from my bed\r\n    and told to get ready; then I asked the privilege of getting something\r\n    to brush off my clothes and my shoes, and after paying a little for\r\n    it, I did get it; and I was taken out by these two same men that had\r\n    arrested me. Now, before I proceed any further, will you let me go\r\n    back a little?\r\n\r\n    Q. Yes.\r\n\r\n    A. All the five hours I was kept a prisoner at police headquarters\r\n    with Inspector Williams standing over me, I might say, with drawn\r\n    baton, two detectives were up at my house, which shows this was a\r\n    put-up job and conspiracy to degrade me; from quarter after seven or\r\n    half-past seven, from the time this happened two detectives were up at\r\n    my house bullying my wife and scaring her to death, and all this time\r\n    they knew I was down in the hands of Inspector Williams. Inspector\r\n    Williams told me this with great glee as I was about to be taken away.\r\n    I said, “You must have no heart.” I said, “I don’t mind the\r\n    persecution I have been subjected to, but I don’t wish to have that\r\n    inflicted on my wife and children; they will go crazy. I beg you to\r\n    telephone the station-house, and have those brutes taken out of my\r\n    house;” and he did, but they were there up to midnight, and all these\r\n    five hours in my house bullying my wife and sending my children into\r\n    hysterics.\r\n\r\n    Q. You went to Court the next morning, did you?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir. I begged then of the men that they would allow me to buy\r\n    a pair of glasses more or less to conceal my lacerated face. I was in\r\n    a terrible state. They refused until I got very near the place and I\r\n    said, “I will make trouble for somebody if I go in this condition;”\r\n    and they let me buy a large pair of blue goggles, and I sent for\r\n    Counsellor Charles T. Duffy, who is at present justice of the peace in\r\n    Long Island City, and I told him what happened to me, and he said,\r\n    “These people are too much for me; I will go and get somebody to\r\n    assist you. What do you think of Mr. Hummel?” I said, “Do what you\r\n    like about it; have Mr. Hummel.” I paid him a retainer fee, and he\r\n    said, “These are infernal brutes, and we ought to break them.” I said,\r\n    “I am prepared to do what you tell me.” When the case was brought up\r\n    it was laughed out of Court; there was no case for me or my men. They\r\n    first had me to get bondsmen before the thing was tried; but there was\r\n    no case tried--there was no case to try. Hummel said, “What have you\r\n    against this man; he has not destroyed any documents.”--Vol. iv., p.\r\n    4,520.\r\n\r\nMr. Costello was taken home, and laid up in bed for five days. His face\r\nhad to be sewn up. The doctor, who, by-the-bye, was Mr. Croker’s\r\nbrother-in-law, certified that the injury to the face had been produced by\r\nbrass knuckles, the cut being too severe to have been produced by the\r\nsimple fist. He was threatened with erysipelas, but, fortunately,\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nI should have mentioned that while Mr. Costello was being taken into the\r\nstation-house all bloody and muddy, his book-keeper came to obtain access\r\nto him. Captain McLaughlin stopped him, pulled open his overcoat, and\r\nsearched his pockets.\r\n\r\n“What is this for?” cried Stanley. The Captain made no answer, but\r\ncontinued the search. “What does this mean?” angrily asked Stanley.\r\n\r\n“You know d---- well what it means,” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“I do not understand you,” said Stanley. “What is it for?”\r\n\r\n“Open the door,” said the Captain to an orderly, “open the door.” The\r\norderly opened the door. “Now,” said the Captain, “get the Hell out of\r\nhere!” and the book-keeper was promptly forced right out, and left on the\r\nsidewalk to reflect upon the irony of events which had subjected the\r\nauthor of “Our Police Protectors” to such treatment.\r\n\r\nIt is a very pretty story, and one which naturally provokes the inquiry as\r\nto how such things could be practised with impunity. Mr. Costello himself\r\nsaid that if there had not been so much Celtic blood in his veins there\r\nwould have been several funerals in New York, for he was not only a Celtic\r\nIrishman but a Catholic Irishman, and murder was repugnant both to his\r\nreligion and to his nature. Other redress than that which could be gained\r\nby your own right hand it was impossible to obtain, for it was this\r\nwitness who made the famous remark previously quoted. Senator O’Connor\r\nasked him, “Did you ever take any proceedings against these men?” and the\r\nwitness replied, “I never did, sir. It is no use going to law with the\r\ndevil and court and hell!”\r\n\r\nHe probably thought himself lucky that he had escaped without permanent\r\ndisfigurement. One Thomas J. Standant was less fortunate. A policeman\r\nnamed Schillinberger, of the Eleventh Precinct, who was a very athletic\r\nman, struck Standant a tremendous blow with his fist, which was not, as in\r\nMcLaughlin’s case, provided with brass knuckles. Standant’s nose was\r\nsmashed, the blood poured from his eyes and ears, and he was carried to\r\nthe hospital, where he had to submit to various operations before he\r\nrecovered his eyesight and hearing. He was badly disfigured for life. When\r\nhe brought an action against the policeman for assault, the officer was\r\ndefended by the Corporation Counsel. Schillinberger, although indicted by\r\nthe Grand Jury, was never suspended for a moment, but continued on duty\r\nduring the whole of the sittings of the Commission.\r\n\r\nIn another case a witness was produced who could hardly speak\r\nintelligibly. On Thanksgiving morning he had bought a couple of crabs from\r\nan oyster stand, the owner of which had apparently paid blackmail, and was\r\ntherefore under the protection of the police. When the policeman on the\r\nbeat heard the altercation between the customer and the protected oyster\r\nstand keeper he walked up to the witness and, without a word, delivered a\r\nsmashing blow upon his mouth. Two front teeth were splintered up into the\r\ngum, inflicting so severe an injury that it was two days before the\r\nswelling abated sufficiently for the dentist to be able to cut away the\r\nteeth, and four days before the roots could be touched. The dentist\r\ndeclared that the officer must have had something in his hand, either\r\nbrass knuckles or some other weapon of that kind, to splinter the teeth so\r\nbadly. But in all those cases the fist seems to have been the favourite\r\nweapon.\r\n\r\nThe only other case that I shall refer to is that in which the policeman\r\nused his club. There was a fight in the hallway of a house, and one Frank\r\nAngelo had stepped in to try to part the combatants. Up came a policeman\r\nof the name of Zimmerman, who rushed into the midst of the _mêlée_, and\r\nstriking Angelo heavily with his club, knocked his eye out. The eye hung\r\ndown on the man’s cheek, and had to be subsequently removed. Angelo, all\r\nbloody, with his eye in this ghastly position, was arrested by his\r\nassailant, and taken to the police-court. The poor fellow, not knowing\r\nwhat would befall him, sent for a lawyer, who first of all charged him £10\r\nfor his professional services, and then said that the only way for him to\r\nget out of the scrape was to pay the officer £5, which he accordingly did.\r\nThe judge asked him no question, and discharged the case. It is needless\r\nto say that Angelo brought no action against the policeman. There was no\r\njustice, he said, in New York. Justice there was indeed--hideous,\r\ndiabolical, devil’s justice. It is bad enough to have your eye knocked out\r\nwith a policeman’s club in the street when you are endeavouring to prevent\r\na fight, but it is worse to have to pay that policeman £5 for having\r\nperformed that operation, and an additional £10 to a lawyer to induce the\r\nruffian to accept the money.\r\n\r\nAfter reading this, it is not surprising that Mr. Goff, now Recorder of\r\nthe City of New York, publicly declared, after a careful examination of\r\nthe records of the Police Department for three years, that it could be\r\nproved that the police force was to all intents and purposes and in\r\npractice exempted from and above the operation of the law of the land. Mr.\r\nGoff, after saying that in three years only one policeman had been\r\nconvicted for an assault upon a citizen, and remarking that the air of the\r\ntrial-room at police headquarters was blue with perjury, continued thus:--\r\n\r\n    The members of the police force of this city commit offences of the\r\n    grade of felony and misdemeanour, and they have gone for years\r\n    unpunished and unwhipped for those offences, which, if committed by\r\n    citizens, would have resulted in fact in sentence to State’s prison,\r\n    and to the penitentiary. In other words, the operation of the law of\r\n    this State, so far as it applies to the citizens of New York, and to\r\n    all persons as it should, stops short of the police force. Felonious\r\n    assaults have been committed upon citizens by policemen, which if\r\n    committed by a civilian would result possibly in four or five years’\r\n    sentence in Sing Sing, and all the policeman need apprehend is, a\r\n    charge against him, with a possible conviction finding him guilty of\r\n    assault, and a fine, for instance, of ten days’ pay. A police officer\r\n    of this city can brain a citizen with a club, and he may reasonably\r\n    expect that all the penalty he will have to pay for that is about the\r\n    sum of thirty dollars, while an ordinary citizen, if he commits that\r\n    offence, is almost certain to go to State’s prison.--Vol. iii., p.\r\n    2,826.\r\n\r\nThis is not a case of one law for the rich and another for the poor. It is\r\none law for the citizen and none at all for the policeman.\r\n\r\nSome of the evidence taken as to the action of the police supplied the\r\nCommittee with very sensational episodes. One witness, for instance, a\r\ntruckman, of the name of Lucas, appeared before them with his head in a\r\nfrightful state of disfigurement. The man had been drunk, and gone to\r\nsleep on a doorstep, when he was robbed of four dollars. On waking up,\r\nfinding that he had lost the money, he asked a policeman if he could find\r\nout anything as to who had robbed him. This seemed to offend the officer,\r\nfor he struck Lucas in the face, knocked him down in the gutter, and then\r\nstanding over him, belaboured him unmercifully with his club on his face\r\nand head. “For God’s sake!” cried the man, “do not kill me altogether.” A\r\nyoung man, a stranger, coming past, seeing the outrageous nature of the\r\nassault, asked the policeman to stop. Thereupon another policeman in\r\ncitizen’s clothes ran up, knocked him down, jumped on him, and then\r\nmarched Lucas and the stranger off to the police-station. The blood\r\nrunning down Lucas’s neck, drenched his shirt, and one of the picturesque\r\nincidents of the inquiry was the production of the bloody shirt before the\r\nsenators. The man was bleeding so freely that the sergeant of the\r\npolice-station had to sew up the top of his head. It took twenty-seven\r\nstitches to sew up the wound opened by the policeman’s club. When he got\r\ninto the police-station he was again assaulted, and had he not run for the\r\nsergeant, he was of the opinion that he would have been killed altogether.\r\nThe next morning he was brought before the judge, and discharged. Nothing\r\nseems to have been done to the officer.\r\n\r\nThe Committee summed up the whole case in the following sentences:--\r\n\r\n    It was proven by a stream of witnesses who poured continuously into\r\n    the sessions of the committee, that many of the members of the force,\r\n    and even superior officers, have abused the resources of physical\r\n    power which have been provided for them and their use only in cases of\r\n    necessity in the making of arrests and the restraint of disorder, to\r\n    gratify personal spite and brutal instincts, and to reduce their\r\n    victims to a condition of servility....\r\n\r\n    Besides this exhibit of convicted clubbers, still wearing the uniform\r\n    of the force, there was a stream of victims of police brutality who\r\n    testified before your committee. The eye of one man, pushed out by a\r\n    patrolman’s club, hung on his cheek. Others were brought before the\r\n    committee, fresh from their punishment, covered with blood and\r\n    bruises, and in some cases battered out of recognition. Witnesses\r\n    testified to severe assaults upon them while under arrest in the\r\n    station-houses. The line of testimony might have been endlessly\r\n    pursued by your committee.... We emphasise this finding of brutality\r\n    because it affects every citizen whatever his condition, because it\r\n    shows an invasion of constitutional liberty by one of the departments\r\n    of government whose supreme duty it is to enforce the law, and because\r\n    it establishes a condition of affairs gravely imperilling the safety\r\n    and the welfare of the people in their daily avocations.--Vol. i., p.\r\n    31.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INSPECTOR WILLIAMS, CHIEF CLUBBER OF THE FORCE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMERICAN TRACT SOCIETY’S DEPÔT. (New York is a city whose\r\nBuildings are as colossal as the Corruption of its Police.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nKING MCNALLY AND HIS POLICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Confidence Trick is perhaps the form of crime that would most\r\nnaturally commend itself to the police banditti of New York. For the force\r\nwas engaged all day long in playing a gigantic Confidence Trick upon the\r\ncitizens. The gold brick which the swindlers sold to the credulous\r\ncountryman was hardly more mythical than the enforcement of the law which\r\nwas supposed to be secured by the organisation of the City police. It is\r\ntherefore not surprising to learn that the police were hand-and-glove with\r\nthe gang of swindlers which, under King McNally, carried on the Green\r\nGoods trade in the City of New York. It was one of the most lucrative of\r\nall the crimes which were carried on under police protection, and one of\r\nthe safest. Few of all the stories told before the Lexow Committee display\r\nquite so unblushing a co-partnership between the law-breakers and the law\r\nofficers as was revealed in this Green Goods swindle. The rascality of the\r\nrogues was so audacious that it provokes a laugh. For it is possible to\r\ncarry impudence to a point where indignation is momentarily submerged by\r\nthe sense of the ludicrous. Sheer amazement at the existence of such\r\npreposterous villains begets such a sense of its absurdity, that any\r\ncensure seems as much out of place as in the nonsense tales of the\r\nnursery. Yet when the grotesque impression subsides, it is difficult to\r\nfind terms strong enough to characterise this systematic misuse of the\r\npowers created for the protection of life and property and the due\r\nobservance of the law for the purpose of facilitating fraud and of aiding\r\nand abetting and protecting swindling.\r\n\r\nThe evidence taken before the Lexow Committee contains a mass of materials\r\nfor an exhaustive description of the criminals of New York, and the\r\nvarious methods by which in 1894 they preyed upon the public; but the\r\nperson who undertakes the compilation of such a work is not to be envied.\r\nThe Report of the Committee is a very striking illustration of the\r\nwickedness of issuing books without indexes. Here we have five bulky\r\nvolumes of evidence without even an index of the names of witnesses. There\r\nis no subject-index of any kind. Witnesses are called and recalled in\r\nbewildering confusion. Nevertheless, even the most cursory perusal of the\r\nevidence brings to light a great many interesting and extraordinary facts\r\nas to the organisation of the criminal classes of the city.\r\n\r\nGreen Goods are forged or counterfeit bank notes. The pretence is either\r\nthat there has been an over-issue of certain denominations of paper money\r\nby the Treasury, or that the plates have been stolen from the Government,\r\nand by this means it is possible to offer to sell ten dollars for one.\r\n\r\nMcNally, the King of the Green Goods men, employed at times a staff of\r\nthirty-five men. He began his career some twenty years ago as a bully who\r\nwas kept by a prostitute. He swindled out of all her money a mistress of\r\nhis who kept a restaurant, and started an Opium Joint. He then embarked in\r\nthe Green Goods business, kept his carriage, and made his fortune.\r\n\r\nThe men who work this Confidence Trick seem to have carried their\r\norganised system of swindling to a very high pitch of perfection. Their\r\nmaster-stroke, however, was the admission of the police to a working\r\npartnership, which enabled them not merely to carry on their swindling\r\nwith impunity, but also stood them in good stead whenever a victim had to\r\nbe bullied and driven out of the city. King McNally was, unfortunately,\r\nnot available for examination, owing to his precipitate departure for\r\nforeign parts as soon as the inquiry began. The Committee, however, was\r\nable to secure evidence which brought out very clearly the main lines of\r\ntheir operations.\r\n\r\nThe chief witness was one William Applegate, whose sister accompanied\r\nMcNally in his hurried departure to Paris. Applegate had been employed for\r\nthree years as one of the gang. He began when nineteen as a\r\ncircular-folder, for which he received 8s. a week. These formed the\r\nfoundation of the Green Goods business. A Green Goods gang in full\r\noperation is constituted as follows:--\r\n\r\n(1) The Backer or Capitalist, who supplies the bank roll--a roll of 10,000\r\ngenuine dollar bills, which are shown to the victim. He receives fifty per\r\ncent., out of which he pays the police, and so guarantees the protection\r\nof the gang.\r\n\r\n(2) The Writer, who addresses the wrappers in which the circulars, bogus\r\nnewspaper-cuttings, etc., are enclosed. He receives the other fifty per\r\ncent., out of which he has to pay the percentage due to the rest of the\r\ngang.\r\n\r\n(3) The Bunco Steerer, who is sent to meet the victim at some hotel, fifty\r\nto a hundred miles distant from the city. He is the messenger who gives\r\nthe victim the pass-word, and then leads him to the Joint or den where the\r\nswindle is completed. He receives five per cent. of the plunder.\r\n\r\n(4) The Old Man, a respectable-looking old gentleman, who says nothing,\r\nbut who sits solemnly in the Joint when the “beat” is being carried\r\nthrough. He receives five dollars.\r\n\r\n(5) The Turner, who is represented as the son of the old man, and does the\r\nselling of the bogus notes. His fee is ten dollars.\r\n\r\n(6) The Ringer, a confederate behind the partition, who dexterously\r\nreplaces the good money shown in the bank roll by the bundles of bogus\r\nnotes. His fee is five dollars.\r\n\r\n(7) The Tailer, who remains on guard at the railway station, personating a\r\npoliceman, for the purpose of bullying any victim who discovers he has\r\nbeen swindled, and returns to try to recover his money. This gentleman is\r\nalso paid five dollars a victim.\r\n\r\nWith this staff, and the protection of the police, the Green Goods\r\nbusiness can be carried on very successfully. McNally used to take as much\r\nas £1,600 in a single day. Fortunes of £40,000 were accumulated by the\r\nleading backers, although McNally’s pile was not estimated at more than\r\n£20,000.\r\n\r\nThe first step is the obtaining of directories and the arranging for the\r\ndespatch of circulars. The circulars were of the familiar kind, printed as\r\nif typewritten, and addressed by a staff of writers, of whom McNally had\r\neight or ten kept constantly at work. Enclosed in the envelope with the\r\ncircular were slips printed as if they were cut out of newspapers, the\r\nsame with intent to deceive, the slip being carefully written by Mr.\r\nMcNally, or some member of his gang, for the purpose of giving the reader\r\nto understand that the offer of the circular was _bonâ fide_ and reliable.\r\nThese were sent out by thousands, the printer executing orders for 200,000\r\nsets at a time. A slip was also included giving the address to which a\r\ntelegram should be sent, in order to secure the advantageous offer made to\r\nthe victim by the circular. These addresses were usually vacant lots in\r\nthe city, but arrangements were made by bribing the officials of the\r\ntelegraph company to hold all telegrams sent to such fictitious addresses\r\nuntil called for.\r\n\r\nThe business was carried on a kind of mutual partnership basis. It was\r\nworked somewhat in this fashion. A writer would send out 10,000 circulars\r\nor more a day. One, or perhaps two, of those would hook a victim, who\r\nwould telegraph, making an application for the money offered him at such\r\ntempting terms. This victim would belong to the writer of the circular by\r\nwhich he had been caught. Having thus hooked a victim, he had to be\r\nlanded, and for this purpose he had to be brought to town and personally\r\nconducted by a bunco steerer to the den or joints where three confederates\r\nfooled the victim to the top of his bent, and usually succeeded in\r\nfleecing him by one form or another of the confidence trick.\r\n\r\nThe victim, who was known as a “Come On” or as a “Guy,” was swindled by a\r\nvariety of methods. One favourite plan was to undertake to sell the\r\ncredulous rustic 10,000 dollars for 650 dollars. For less than 650 dollars\r\nhe was told he could not have the “State rights.” The monopoly for his own\r\nState was promised to the favoured individual, whose 650 dollars had to\r\nbe paid down on the spot. A locked box was then given him, within which he\r\nwas assured there were 10,000 dollars in coin. In reality, there was a\r\nbrick, which was all the poor victim got for his money.\r\n\r\nAnother method of swindling was thus described by the witness Applegate\r\nwhen under examination by Mr. Goff:--\r\n\r\n    Q. I hand you two tin boxes; do you recognise those as belonging to\r\n    McNally?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n    Q. Were those boxes used in his business?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n    Q. Here is a third one, and a fourth one; what were those four boxes\r\n    used for?\r\n\r\n    A. They would put the money in one box for the man, in a box like\r\n    that, and that would be a deal of from about 300 dollars to 500\r\n    dollars; they would put the money in this box and it would be in front\r\n    of the victim, and in the meantime a duplicate box would be behind the\r\n    partition, and in the duplicate box there would be a brick and some\r\n    paper, and they would put the money in this box here on the desk and\r\n    lock it up before the victim; it would be on the back of the desk like\r\n    that, and then Billy Vosburgh would say, “Get that book,” and with\r\n    that they would lift up the desk and that would hide the box from the\r\n    victim, and then Walter McNally, who did the ringing, would open his\r\n    trap door and take this box in and put the other box out; it would all\r\n    be done in a second.\r\n\r\n    Q. I will now hand you this fifth box; what is that used for?\r\n\r\n    A. That was used for the bank roll.\r\n\r\n    Q. What is there--is there a false lid to that?\r\n\r\n    A. No; there is one, yes.\r\n\r\n    Q. How was the bank roll brought into play there; explain about that?\r\n\r\n    A. The bank roll would be laid right in there, 8,200 dollars; it would\r\n    be laid there. There was supposed to be 8,200 dollars done up in\r\n    packages, with three elastics around them.\r\n\r\n    Q. Now, I hand you this book, and ask you if those were the packages\r\n    there were exchanged for the genuine packages?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir; these were, as we called them, the dummies.\r\n\r\n    Q. Explain how they were operated?\r\n\r\n    A. You see this is a package supposed to be of 5 dollar bills. There\r\n    would be a good one on the top, and a good one on the bottom, and here\r\n    would lay the same package of genuine money, and Walter would count\r\n    out, say, 200 dollars in 5 dollar bills, which would be so much, and\r\n    he would say, to save time, “We will measure the packages together,\r\n    and, instead of counting each and every bill, we will put the packages\r\n    together,” and the victim would think there was the same amount of\r\n    money in each one, and then, through sleight-of-hand, he would put\r\n    these in the box, and the good money on top; and if the victim wanted\r\n    to see the packages again he would show them, and the one on top would\r\n    be good money; and if the victim is a hard victim, he might want to\r\n    take the money with him, and then Walter would shift these packages,\r\n    and, therefore, he got about 60 dollars for 500 dollars or 1,000\r\n    dollars.\r\n\r\n    Q. And the victim would get those packages that we now exhibit,\r\n    instead of the packages containing the good money that he has seen?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n    Q. There were many of those in use, were there not?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir, we would never take the elastics off these; we would just\r\n    take the elastics off the good money.\r\n\r\n    Q. Here is a box with a heavy weight; see what is in this box?\r\n\r\n    A. I guess that is a brick (witness takes out a brick wrapped up in\r\n    paper); that is what he would get for his 650 dollars; for a 300\r\n    dollar deal he would get half a brick; for 10,000 dollars it would\r\n    have to be heavier than for a less amount.--Vol. iii., pp. 2,575-6.\r\n\r\nIn connection with McNally’s gang there was an Art Gallery fitted up\r\nadjoining a saloon used sometimes as McNally’s headquarters. The chief\r\nfeature of this Art Gallery was a great number of pictures representing\r\ntreasuries filled with all kinds of money. “Here,” said the Steerer to the\r\nGuy, “is the picture of what you will get in reality.” The effect upon his\r\nimagination of these painted representations of enormous treasure in gold\r\nand silver predisposed the victim to part freely with his money, and\r\nbelieve the plausible friends who so kindly proposed to point out to him\r\nso short a cut to a fortune. McNally had a private carriage also, with a\r\nfootman in livery. “The carriage racket,” as it was called, was thus\r\ndescribed by Applegate:--\r\n\r\n    Q. Now, proceed and describe the operations of the carriage?\r\n\r\n    A. Well, previous to the steerer and the guy coming to the carriage,\r\n    there would be a satchel put there, a little red satchel.\r\n\r\n    Q. In the carriage?\r\n\r\n    A. In the carriage, with a brick and paper in it; there would also be\r\n    two or three satchels without anything in it on the seat of the\r\n    carriage. Walter Haines would get in with the guy. Walter Haines would\r\n    have the money in the bag, the bank roll, and he would put the money\r\n    in the satchel, a duplicate satchel to the one that had the brick in\r\n    it; he would put the money in the satchel, and after the guy had paid\r\n    Haines his money so--we never received theirs before we gave them\r\n    ours, and after he made the deal and everything was all right, Haines\r\n    would say, “I will go to the depôt,” and the steerer would grab the\r\n    satchel and run out, and Walter Haines would slip the money in the\r\n    cab, and Haines would say, “The steerer will go with you,” and he\r\n    would go away with the steerer.\r\n\r\n    Q. Were there any cases in which they discovered the fraud before they\r\n    left the State?\r\n\r\n    A. No, we worked kind of snug; when we were working the carriage\r\n    racket we worked a little on the snug.\r\n\r\n    Q. What is that?\r\n\r\n    A. We did not have the protection we ought to have had, and the\r\n    steerer then would have to go with the guy and keep the satchel and\r\n    see the guy on the train, and, after he got on the train, he didn’t\r\n    care a darn where he went.\r\n\r\n    Q. And he did not have the facilities as in the turning joint?\r\n\r\n    A. No, sir; we would not give him the satchel until he got on the\r\n    train, and would say, “We will give you this at the proper time and\r\n    place.”\r\n\r\n    Q. Weren’t you in the habit of giving to the guy keys?\r\n\r\n    A. No; we generally threw the key away and told him to cut it open;\r\n    not with the satchel; with the box we gave him keys.\r\n\r\n    Q. Was there any design in giving the keys with the box?\r\n\r\n    A. We never gave him the key which fitted the box.\r\n\r\n    Q. So when they got on the railroad----\r\n\r\n    A. When a guy gets a box like that there will be some combination on\r\n    it, and he will get the wrong key, and he don’t know how to get out of\r\n    it.\r\n\r\n    Q. And you always made sure to give him a key that would not open the\r\n    box?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir; the reason of that is that we gave him a key that fits\r\n    the box with the money in, and that would not fit the box that had the\r\n    brick in.--Vol. iii., pp. 2,613-5.\r\n\r\nThere were many ways of swindling the unfortunate guy. When once they are\r\nhooked, they can be played with to almost any extent. In this, as in\r\nhigher regions, the saying holds good--\r\n\r\n  Faith, fanatic faith, once wedded fast\r\n  To some dear falsehood, hugs it to the last.\r\n\r\nA guy will pay his money down and expect the notes to be sent to his\r\norder. When they fail to turn up, he will come back and buy some more,\r\nwhich are to be expressed to him. When they do not arrive, he will come\r\nback the third time and do another deal, and see them checked at the\r\nstation with his ticket. The baggage-man is accused of stealing the money,\r\nand the guy comes up for a fourth time. In this final purchase he never\r\nallows the box or bag to go out of his own hands. Not until he opens the\r\nprecious parcel and finds the brick or counterfeit notes or rolls of\r\npaper, does it dawn upon him that he has been done.\r\n\r\nThe need for great secrecy and the importance of getting a long way off\r\nthe city before opening the box do not seem unreasonable to a man who\r\nknows that he is engaged in a more or less fraudulent transaction. It is\r\nthe knowledge of the guy that he is doing a more or less crooked business\r\nwhich enables the gang to plunder him with such impunity.\r\n\r\nSome such methods are probably familiar to the police of all the cities in\r\nthe world, but that which was peculiar to New York was the arrangement\r\nmade for carrying on this business, not merely with the cognizance of, but\r\nwith the active co-operation of the police. This partnership was so close\r\nthat in McNally’s case all the business was carried on in conjunction with\r\na police captain of the name of Meakin, who had as his agent at\r\nheadquarters a detective of the name of Hanley. It is difficult to repress\r\na smile on reading, at the very opening of Applegate’s evidence, how\r\nthings were worked.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then, when the newspapers made too much fuss concerning the\r\nscandals of the Police Department, the authorities would order what is\r\nknown as a “general shake-up”--_i.e._, the captains would be shifted all\r\nround, the assumption being that a new broom would sweep clean, and that\r\nby changing the captains from one precinct to another the abuses that had\r\ncreated any fuss would be rectified. Unfortunately the whole system of\r\nblackmail and corruption was so elaborately organised that the shifting of\r\nthe captains made no change. Each newcomer succeeded to the business, and\r\ncarried on the collection of blackmail without losing a single day.\r\n“Business carried on as usual during alterations” might have been posted\r\nup over every police-station in New York; but in the case of Green Goods\r\nmen, their business was too profitable to be lost by the captain who had\r\nonce got hold of it. The consequence was that, when the shake-up took\r\nplace, and Captain Meakin was transferred from the “down-town precinct” to\r\nHarlem at the other end of the island, he carried all the Green Goods men\r\nwith him up to his new station. As soon as the order was given that the\r\nshake-up was to be enforced, Captain Meakin sent word to McNally that he\r\nmust follow him to Harlem. McNally thereupon told all his writers, Bunco\r\nsteerers and Turners that they must pack up their traps, and follow the\r\nCaptain to the precinct to which he had been transferred. The notice was\r\nshort, and for a moment it seemed as if the smooth course of the Green\r\nGoods business would be interfered with, for several victims were on\r\ntheir way to the rendezvous fixed by the writers in Captain McNally’s old\r\nprecinct. The resources of roguery are not so easily exhausted; the Bunco\r\nsteerers were ordered to bring their victims from the down town precinct\r\nto some saloons in Harlem until the gang had arranged with the Captain as\r\nto where the victims were to be plundered in the new precinct.\r\n\r\nThe saloon in which the confidence trick was played, and the room in which\r\nthe victim was relieved of his money, was known as the “Joint,” or the\r\nplace where they “beat the victim.” The first thing necessary was,\r\ntherefore, to find out a saloon that would be available for the purposes\r\nof the gang. Captain Meakin was a man of resource. He and his wardman met\r\nMcNally at a drug store, and arranged with a saloon-keeper of the name of\r\nHawkins that the joint should be opened in his saloon. The arrangement\r\nmade with Hawkins was that he should have a sovereign for every man that\r\nwas fleeced at his place.\r\n\r\nVery little time was lost in bundling the boxes, with the bricks and all\r\nthe other paraphernalia of the craft, into an express waggon. The King\r\ndrove up in his carriage with the bank-roll and his liveried coachman,\r\nwhile the Turners followed by the Elevated Railway. As soon as the\r\narrangement was fixed up with the King and the Captain and the\r\nSaloon-keeper, the signal was given, and the victims, who were planted at\r\nvarious saloons in the neighbourhood by the Bunco steerers waiting until\r\nthe Police Captain and the King had fixed up arrangements as to the joint,\r\nwere brought down and fleeced. Thus, without the loss of a single day the\r\nbusiness was transferred, and was running merrily under the protecting\r\nægis of Captain Meakin and his police.\r\n\r\nFor four months this went on, until at last the scandal became so great\r\nthat the Police Commissioners received representations from the\r\ninhabitants, and it became evident that the Hawkins saloon would no longer\r\nserve as headquarters. A friendly communication was sent to the thieves by\r\nDetective Charlton. He told them that they would have to quit, but at the\r\nsame time he obligingly suggested that the saloon of a man named Day in\r\nthe immediate neighbourhood would be quite as convenient, and would serve\r\nequally well as a place for “beating” their victims. To Day’s saloon,\r\ntherefore, the Joint was transferred, and business went on for five\r\nmonths, ten or twelve writers being busily employed in sending out\r\ncirculars, as many as fifteen thousand being sometimes despatched in a\r\nsingle day.\r\n\r\nAt last an order was issued from headquarters ordering the arrest of all\r\nthe Green Goods men of New York. This looked serious, but when you have a\r\nfriend in the force you do not get arrested, excepting as a friendly\r\nput-up job. When the order was issued from headquarters, Detective\r\nCharlton was sent by Captain Meakin to inform McNally that they were\r\ngoing to raid the Joint, and advised him to remove all the stuff before\r\nthe police arrived. This timely hint was promptly acted upon, and when the\r\nplace was raided nothing was found. The Green Goods men in the meanwhile\r\nhad transferred themselves to Jersey, which, being a foreign State, was\r\nbeyond the jurisdiction of the Superintendent. But everything was done to\r\nmake their sojourn in Jersey pleasant; Captain Meakin gave them a\r\nrecommendation to a detective in the Jersey force, who saw to it that they\r\nwere not interfered with. In return for those services, Captain Meakin\r\nreceived from McNally £90 a month, the tariff being fixed at £10 per\r\nwriter. The money was paid to Detective Charlton, who handed it over, no\r\ndoubt after collecting his commission, to the Captain.\r\n\r\nIf the matter had only stopped here, the case of the Green Goods men would\r\nnot have differed materially from that of the disorderly houses, which all\r\nsubsidised the police, and were protected in return. But in the case of\r\nthese swindlers, who elevated the confidence trick almost to the level of\r\na fine art, there was a further development. If any of the writers were\r\nbehind in their payments to the King, McNally promptly denounced them to\r\nthe Captain, and the defaulting writer was as promptly arrested. By this\r\nmeans discipline was enforced in the gang and all bad debts avoided.\r\nAgain, if any writer refused to follow McNally to the district where he\r\nwanted him, or in any other way allowed his personal preferences to\r\ninterfere with the orders of the King, he was denounced and run in by the\r\nobedient, uniformed myrmidons of his majesty.\r\n\r\nIn order to enforce discipline over the whole of New York City, it was\r\nnecessary to supplement the arrangement with Captain Meakin by a similar\r\nunderstanding with an officer at the headquarters department. This officer\r\nwas Charles Hanley. “He was McNally’s right hand man, and any time he got\r\ninto trouble or his men got into trouble, the first man he sent for was\r\nHanley; and Hanley was always sent for.” He represented the Detective\r\nBureau, and his services were necessary when any unfortunate victim,\r\ndiscovering that he had nothing but a brick in his box, came back to the\r\ncity and made complaint. A considerable number of the guys, or the\r\nvictims, never came back, being too thoroughly ashamed of their folly to\r\nface an exposure; but a certain proportion did. These “Come-backs,” as\r\nthey were called, naturally applied to the Detective Bureau at the police\r\nheadquarters, and there they were taken in hand by McNally’s partner.\r\nApplegate explained the working of this system as follows:--\r\n\r\n    In cases of a come-back of any kind; in case a man has been swindled\r\n    who has found the brick in the box before he has left New York; and as\r\n    a rule he would go to the central office and make a holler; Hanley\r\n    would always seem to be the detective that would get the man in\r\n    charge; the man would be brought up town to try and identify the\r\n    people, which he never could do; then we always got the tip to go\r\n    away; the man would be brought down town and chased out of town as\r\n    being a counterfeiter; and they would pay 500 dollars, and 250 dollars\r\n    would go back to the police; the police claimed half of the\r\n    deal.--Vol. iii., p. 2,590.\r\n\r\nThe method, it will be seen, was extremely ingenious. The swindlers had\r\npassed forged notes upon their victim. When he made a complaint, he was\r\npromptly arrested or driven out of the town by the confederates of the\r\ngang in the police for having counterfeit notes in his possession! No\r\nwonder things went “nice and easy.” Applegate described one scene which\r\nhad evidently afforded the gang great amusement. A victim, who had been\r\nswindled, and had applied to the police for redress, was handed over in\r\nthe usual course to Hanley, who took him up town to the saloon where he\r\nhad been robbed, to see if he could find the Bunco steerer who had\r\ninveigled him into the Joint. Applegate himself acted as the go-between on\r\nthat occasion. He warned the Steerer to keep out of the way, and then\r\nasked Hanley to bring the Guy down past the windows of the saloon, where\r\nthe men who had swindled him could have some fun in watching him as he was\r\ntrotted about the street on a false scent. By some strange mistake, and\r\ndespite all warnings, the Steerer ran into the Detective and the Guy; but\r\neven this difficulty was overcome, for a few words from the Detective put\r\nit all right, and the Steerer went off without being arrested. For his\r\npart in that little comedy Hanley got one-half of the money of which the\r\nman had been swindled. In this case Hanley’s share of the plunder amounted\r\nto £50. The victim was chased out of the town under the threat of arrest\r\nand imprisonment for having counterfeit notes in his possession.\r\n\r\n“You see,” said the witness, apologetically, “the guy is a guy, and you\r\ncan do almost anything with him.” It is certainly not difficult, when you\r\nhave the police to stand in whenever you get into a tight place.\r\n\r\nThe only terror which seemed to haunt the mind of the Green Goods men was\r\nthat of being shot down by some sharper who made himself up as a guy in\r\norder to possess himself of the bank-roll of genuine money. Appo, a man\r\nwho spent most of his life in picking pockets when he was at liberty, and\r\nin doing time in gaol when he was caught, had a rough experience of the\r\nmurderous possibilities that the Green Goods man has to face. On one\r\noccasion a Tennessee detective made himself up as a country bumpkin. When\r\nthe critical moment came, he clapped his revolver at the head of Appo,\r\nshot out his eye, lodged the bullet in his skull, from which it was never\r\nextracted, and made off with all the money at that time on Appo’s person.\r\nWhen examined before the Committee, Appo thus explained the _modus\r\noperandi_ by which Green Goods men occasionally got cleaned out and\r\nmurdered in the bargain. He said:--\r\n\r\n    ... I take a man; I rig him up; I say, “Do you want to make 5,000\r\n    dols. or 10,000 dols.?” “Yes, sir.” “Well, you go up to a hotel room,\r\n    and I will touch the wires to a party band, bring him there with his\r\n    bank roll, and you play guy; when he comes in and shows his goods,\r\n    take your gun, stick him up, and take his money away from him. If he\r\n    goes to make a kick, shoot him; he cannot do that much; the law will\r\n    protect you; see how Tony Martin got killed there in Brooklyn; them\r\n    men got out; it was cold-blooded murder--wilful, deliberate,\r\n    premeditated murder.” Fixed up? My case was fixed up there in\r\n    Poughkeepsie; the man sneaked up behind me in cold blood and shot me,\r\n    and sent me to State prison for three years and two months.--Vol. ii.,\r\n    p. 1640-1.\r\n\r\nAnother ingenious precaution which was taken by McNally was to have the\r\ndetectives at the various railway stations surrounding New York in his\r\npay, so that in case any Guy were to discover that he had been swindled,\r\nand make a fuss at the station, he could be promptly arrested for holding\r\ncounterfeit money, and so bullied as to make him thankful to get home\r\nwithout saying more about it. The detective at the Central Depôt was paid\r\n£10 a month for his services.\r\n\r\nThe facts as they were detailed before the Lexow Committee were proved by\r\nsuch overwhelming evidence that the chief criminal, Captain Meakin, of the\r\npolice force, was seized with an illness which rendered it impossible for\r\nhim to appear in the witness-box. Perjury to an unlimited extent was\r\nfamiliar enough to the police captains, but the evidence about the Green\r\nGoods gang was too strong even for a police captain to brazen it out. So\r\nit came to pass that Captain Meakin was too dangerously ill during the\r\nsitting of the Committee for his evidence to be taken even at his own\r\nbedside.\r\n\r\nThe Lexow Committee reported on the subject as follows:--\r\n\r\n    It appears conclusively that a heavy traffic of this kind has been\r\n    systematically carried on by these swindlers, who, in exchange for\r\n    protection, shared a large part of their ill-gotten gains with the\r\n    police.... The evidence indicated that the first step in the\r\n    initiation of business of this character was to establish relations\r\n    with the captain of the precinct in which the work was carried on.\r\n\r\n    It appears, moreover, that men notoriously engaged in the swindling or\r\n    confidence business had their headquarters in the city, known to the\r\n    police, where they might be ordinarily found, and that those who were\r\n    receiving protection plied their trade unmolested, while others, who\r\n    had not been fortunate enough to establish relations with the police,\r\n    or those who intruded upon districts not assigned to them, would be\r\n    warned off and in case of failure to obey would be summarily dealt\r\n    with.--Vol. i., p. 39.\r\n\r\nStrange and incredible though it may appear that the police should\r\nactually join hands with the criminals of the type of the Green Goods\r\ngang, it was entirely in keeping with the principles which had been\r\nelaborated into a system in dealing with every form of robbery.\r\n\r\nThe Lexow Committee reported:--\r\n\r\n    It has been conclusively shown that an understanding existed between\r\n    headquarters’ detectives, pawnbrokers and thieves, by which stolen\r\n    property may be promptly recovered by the owner on condition that he\r\n    repay the pawnbroker the amount advanced on the stolen property. In\r\n    almost every instance it also appears that the detective, acting\r\n    between the owner and the pawnbroker, receives substantial gratuities\r\n    from the owner of the property for the work done in his official\r\n    capacity.--Vol. i., p. 40.\r\n\r\nBut there was a still worse form of co-partnership involved in the\r\nprocedure adopted in robberies in houses of ill-fame. A witness of the\r\nname of Lucy C. Harriot, who at the time when she gave her evidence was an\r\ninmate of the workhouse on Blackwell’s Island, but who had an extensive\r\nexperience in the disorderly houses of New York, explained the system in\r\nsome detail. The police, she said, were able to make robberies in what\r\nwere known as panel houses, safe for the thief and profitable to\r\nthemselves. When a man was robbed and went to the station-house for\r\nredress, the Captain usually sent down a wardman to the house, who made it\r\nhis first duty to represent to the victim the prudence of saying nothing\r\nabout it, and of avoiding what would be otherwise a painful exposure. If\r\nthe victim persisted, the wardman would pretend to endeavour to find the\r\ngirl, but always discovered that she had gone off to Europe, or had\r\ndisappeared in some mysterious way. The matter always ended in the man\r\nbeing scared off. I quote the evidence as given in the Report:--\r\n\r\n    By Mr. Goff: And after the stranger is scared off, the wardman goes to\r\n    the house, and isn’t it a rule that the money he is robbed of is\r\n    divided with the police?\r\n\r\n    A. I have heard it ever since I have been round; that is about nine\r\n    years.\r\n\r\n    Q. Where do you come in when you steal 180 dols.; where does your\r\n    profit come in?\r\n\r\n    A. If the man went away quietly, the wardman would have received 90\r\n    dols. of the 180 dols., and I would have got 45 dols. out of the\r\n    remaining half.\r\n\r\n    Q. And the madam for 45 dols.?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n    Q. And the wardman gets, in this case, fifty per cent. of the loot?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir, that is so.--Vol. i., p. 3,620.\r\n\r\n    By Chairman Lexow: How many houses have you been into to which the\r\n    rule as to payment of money and the division of property applies?\r\n\r\n    A. Every one that ever I entered.\r\n\r\n    Q. How many?\r\n\r\n    A. About two dozen, I guess.--Vol. i., p. 3,622.\r\n\r\n    By Senator Bradley: What you say is a general custom?\r\n\r\n    A. A common occurrence.\r\n\r\n    Q. Is that tariff fixed ... the payment of fifty per cent. to the\r\n    wardman, or the policeman, in case of panel theft?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes.\r\n\r\n    Q. That he should get one-half?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n    Q. And that applies to all these twenty-four houses you speak of?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir, every house I went into of that kind.--Vol. i., p. 3,623.\r\n\r\nExcepting in the most barbarous regions of Turkey, where Pashas are\r\nsometimes suspected and accused of winking at the raids of bandits in\r\nconsideration of a share of the spoil, has there ever been such a story as\r\nthis?\r\n\r\nThe principle of territorial jurisdiction is so deeply rooted in the\r\nAmerican mind that the New York police seem to have acted upon it in all\r\ntheir dealings with the criminals whom they shepherded. For instance, they\r\nappear to have parcelled Broadway into blocks, allotting each block to a\r\ndifferent thief, who, of course, paid quit rent for his district to the\r\npolice. The understanding was that the policeman was to be free to arrest\r\nthe thief if there was a complaint made by the victim, but that so long as\r\nno complaints were made the policeman would “close the other eye,” and\r\nallow the pickpocket a free run. Mr. Goff stated that there was once a\r\nfight between the thieves; that one trespassed upon the other’s domain and\r\nwent to a pawnshop about it, and the authorities at police headquarters\r\nthreatened to send the first thief up the river if he ever invaded the\r\nsecond thief’s privileges (vol. v., p. 5,193).\r\n\r\nThis reverent regard for territorial landmarks is very touching. The New\r\nYork police appear to have been as much opposed to poaching as are English\r\ngamekeepers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DELMONICO’S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE PANTATA OF THE POLICY SHOP AND POOL-ROOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong its other achievements, the Lexow Committee enriched the vocabulary\r\nof our language by the word Pantata. It is a mysterious word of Bohemian\r\norigin. What it precisely meant none of the witnesses could explain. It\r\nhad no exact equivalent in the English language, but there was no\r\ndifficulty about understanding how it was applied in New York. Pantata, in\r\nits origin, the interpreters explain, meant father-in-law. The term was\r\nused in households to describe your wife’s father, but it was also held to\r\nbe the equivalent of Old Man; and one witness declared that in Bohemia,\r\nthe country from which the word was exported, it is frequently applied to\r\nthe Emperor-King of Austria-Hungary, Francis Joseph, who is said to be\r\nPantata to his Royal Bohemians.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the original significance of the term, it was applied by\r\nthe Bohemian Liquor Dealers’ Association to the Police Captain of the\r\nprecinct in which they did their business. He was their Pantata, and from\r\nthis beginning the term came to be used as a generic title for the police\r\nofficial, who was on terms of family relationship with the vicious and\r\ncriminal class under his jurisdiction. The New York police captain was in\r\na special sense the father-in-law, or Father-in-the-Law, to a very\r\nnumerous progeny of disreputable people. Instead of being a terror to\r\nevildoers, he became their Pantata, who looked after them with\r\nsemi-paternal care, and generally acted as their Father-in-the-Law,\r\nregarding it indeed as his chief function to relax the law in their behalf\r\nin return, of course, for consideration received. So long as his dues were\r\npaid there was nothing that Pantata would not do. He could, for instance,\r\nand did, practically suspend the legislation for Sunday closing. But that\r\nis a mere trifle.\r\n\r\nIt was proved by the evidence of one witness that the Pantata police did\r\nnot hesitate to issue irregular licences of their own for the keeping of\r\nunlicensed saloons, or shebeens, as we would say.\r\n\r\nOne witness, Anna Newstatel, held a licence once down to the year 1890.\r\nWhen running a full licensed saloon she paid five dollars a month to the\r\npolice. After 1890 her licence was revoked, but in consideration of her\r\nhaving been a good paying subject, the police told her that she might go\r\non selling all kinds of liquor without a licence, so long at she\r\ncontinued to pay her dues to them, in consideration of an initiation fee\r\nof £40 down. The following is the extract from the evidence:--\r\n\r\n    Q. What was your licence revoked for?\r\n\r\n    A. For selling liquor on a beer licence.\r\n\r\n    Q. And after your licence was revoked the police allowed you to sell\r\n    everything without a licence?\r\n\r\n    A. After I paid them 200 dollars at the start and then 50 dollars a\r\n    month.\r\n\r\n    Q. Now did you pay 200 dollars at the start?\r\n\r\n    A. I said I couldn’t afford to do that--I would sooner rent out the\r\n    saloon; and they said if I rent out the saloon as a store, and I\r\n    should live private upstairs and carry on my saloon business upstairs\r\n    for half of the amount--for 100 dollars to start, and 25 dollars every\r\n    month--and I should try that, and they will help me and see that I\r\n    shall have customers enough to do business.\r\n\r\n    Q. In other words, they told you you must go upstairs?\r\n\r\n    Chairman Lexow: That is to say, they would reduce the amount one-half\r\n    if she would do that?\r\n\r\n    Q. You sold on Sunday as well as on weekdays?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n    Q. Now, about the custom that you had. Did the detectives provide you\r\n    with the custom; did they give you custom?\r\n\r\n    A. No, they did not; they came in sometimes themselves and like this,\r\n    only they never paid when they came in; only they allowed me to keep\r\n    open any hour and all the time.--Vol. v., p. 4,592.\r\n\r\nThis claim to be supplied with drink whenever they felt they wanted a\r\nglass appears to have been very generally recognised by the liquor dealers\r\nof New York. Sometimes the police would pretend that they would pay, but,\r\nas a matter of fact, the principle of free drinks seems to have been very\r\nwidely recognised.\r\n\r\nIn the regular saloons there was comparatively little necessity for\r\ninvoking the assistance of the benevolent Pantata. He had a much wider\r\nfield in dealing with the gaming houses, which flourished in every\r\nprecinct in New York. According to the law, no gaming house was allowed to\r\nrun. Yet, by permission of the police, there were about a thousand of them\r\nrunning all the time the Lexow Committee was sitting. I had better quote\r\nhere the extract from the Lexow Committee’s Report:--\r\n\r\n    The evidence is conclusive that with reference to this class of vice\r\n    the police occupied substantially the same position as they did with\r\n    respect to disorderly houses.\r\n\r\n    It was proven even that while the Committee was actually in session\r\n    more than six hundred policy shops were in active operation in the\r\n    city, running openly, and from day to day policy slips were secured in\r\n    some shops in different portions of the city by detectives in the\r\n    employ of your Committee.\r\n\r\n    Qualified witnesses swore that the general average of open shops was\r\n    about one thousand. The testimony disclosed the remarkable fact that\r\n    not only were these violators of the law protected by the police in\r\n    consideration of a fixed sum of 15 dollars a month per shop, but that\r\n    the area of operation of each “king” was so clearly understood and\r\n    carefully guarded, that any intruder would be certified to the police,\r\n    and would either be compelled to refrain from competition with a\r\n    licensed “policy king,” or else would be arrested and condign\r\n    punishment would be visited upon him.\r\n\r\n    It seems clear from the evidence that this division of territory was\r\n    largely for the benefit of the police, insuring a more rapid and\r\n    easier collection of the tribute to be paid the “policy king” to whom\r\n    a particular district had been assigned, paying in bulk at the rate\r\n    of fifteen dollars per shop for all the shops running in such district\r\n    or districts.\r\n\r\n    Pool-rooms flourished all over the city in the same way. Large sums\r\n    were extorted from their proprietors by the police, and they were\r\n    permitted to remain unmolested, openly and publicly running, until a\r\n    private citizen, Richard Croker, after a conference with a police\r\n    commissioner, enforced their cessation practically in a single day.\r\n    This is one of the most remarkable circumstances testified to before\r\n    your Committee. And yet nothing was done or attempted to be done until\r\n    the private citizen aforesaid commanded that they be closed, and they\r\n    were closed, and closed without criminal prosecution.\r\n\r\n    It appeared subsequently in evidence that these pool-rooms, while\r\n    running, had been assessed and had paid for police protection as high\r\n    as 300 dollars a month.--Vol. i., p. 3,637.\r\n\r\nWe have too much betting in England--betting carried on with the active\r\nco-operation of the press--for any English journalist to be able to throw\r\na stone at New York or Chicago, for the extent to which gambling is\r\ncarried on in policy-shops or pool-rooms. The Turf is the great gaming\r\nhell of the Old Country, and nearly every newspaper in the land plays the\r\npart of a tout and tempter to those who wish to gamble. In New York, while\r\nthere is betting enough among certain classes, the masses of the people\r\nseem to prefer other forms of risking their money.\r\n\r\nA very curious picture is given in the evidence taken by the Lexow\r\nCommittee of the prevalence of the gaming habit among all classes of the\r\npopulation, especially in the poorer districts. After making one or two\r\nineffectual attempts, I have given up all hope of understanding, much less\r\nof explaining, the precise way in which gambling goes on in pool-rooms.\r\nFrom the explanations of the witness, the uninitiated outsider can only\r\ndiscern vaguely that policy is much more akin to the Italian lottery\r\nsystem than anything which prevails in this country. Any sum can be\r\nstaked, from one cent upwards. The gambler chooses a number or\r\nconcatenation of numbers. What is called a “saddle” consists of two sets\r\nof numbers, while a “gig” is composed of three. There are many kinds of\r\n“gigs,” which were duly described for the edification of the Committee,\r\nthe “police gig” being one of those most in vogue. In the choice of\r\n“saddles” or “gigs”--or, in other words, in the selection of numbers on\r\nwhich to put his money--the New York gambler is exactly like a Neapolitan,\r\nand in nothing is the resemblance more remarkable than in the respect paid\r\nto dreams. Nearly every policeman, it was declared, had a dream book, and\r\naccording as he dreamed, so he would put his money upon the number\r\nindicated by the dream in his pocket oracle. I made a small collection of\r\ndream books when I was in Chicago, and came to the conclusion that the\r\ndream book was much more constantly consulted in that city than the Old or\r\nNew Testament. Judging from the evidence before the Committee, dream books\r\nare equally in vogue in New York, but any accident or incident would serve\r\nto suggest a favourite combination of lucky numbers, which would be in\r\ngreat request until some other incident arose to suggest a new\r\ncombination. You staked a cent and stood to win a dollar.\r\n\r\nOne of the most painful features of this policy gambling was the extent to\r\nwhich it worked downwards, even to the children. Lads coming from school\r\nwould beg a cent in order to try their luck. As they could only pay by\r\nattracting customers, it was impossible to run a policy shop in secrecy.\r\nIn less than a couple of days the police were perfectly well aware that a\r\npolicy shop had been opened, and it was therefore absolutely necessary to\r\nsecure the police in advance. This seems to have been done on strict\r\nbusiness principles, and the partnership between the various kings or\r\nsatraps, to whom the police farmed out the precinct, appears to have been\r\nvery harmonious.\r\n\r\nBucket-shop and gambling on the tape on the prices quoted on the Stock\r\nExchange is as common in New York as it is in London; but one ingenious\r\nmethod of improving on the bucket-shop was brought to light in the course\r\nof this investigation. The disadvantage of the gambling in _bonâ fide_\r\nStock Exchange securities is that they are often sluggish, and do not go\r\nup and down with sufficient rapidity to stimulate the excitement of the\r\ngambler. In New York a bogus commission agency established a system of\r\ngambling which beat the bucket-shop hollow. Instead of waiting for the\r\narrival of genuine prices of real stocks, the genius who ran this\r\ncommission agency fixed up a tape machine in his office, and before\r\nbusiness started in the morning wrote out a series of about five hundred\r\ndifferent quotations for stock in purely imaginary companies. When his\r\ngamblers had assembled, he turned a handle, and wound off his tape. He\r\nmade the stocks of course go up and down with the requisite rapidity, and\r\nfrom a gaming point of view it was in every way but one superior to the\r\nordinary betting on the tape. The one exception, however, was a pretty\r\nconsiderable drawback, for the proprietor of the establishment knew in\r\nadvance what figures would come out, and how the prices would fluctuate.\r\nSo long, however, as he did not bet himself, this made no difference to\r\nthose who wanted a flutter.\r\n\r\nInto the ramifications of the gambling in New York it is not necessary to\r\nfollow the Committee in their painstaking investigation. It did not even\r\ndraw the line at the Chinese quarter; and those who wish to know all about\r\nFantah, and the mysteries of the Button Game, will find their curiosity\r\ngratified if they read through the Report. All that need be said is that\r\nno form of gambling was carried on at New York which had not the police\r\nauthorities as its protectors, and the rank and file as its patrons. Under\r\nsuch circumstances, it is hardly to be expected that much progress will be\r\nmade in suppressing gambling in New York.\r\n\r\nThe task indeed, as every policeman knows, is one of great difficulty,\r\neven when the force is entirely free from any suspicion of complicity.\r\nMr. Moss, who is now at the head of the police at New York, had to admit\r\nlast September that, despite all his efforts, pool-rooms had been running;\r\nand, as the newspapers declared, some of the police are Pantatas still. It\r\nwas, however, generally admitted that if the Pantata can be exterminated\r\nby zeal, energy, and severity, Mr. Moss is the man to do it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. MOSS, HEAD OF THE NEW YORK POLICE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. PATRICK’S CATHEDRAL, NEW YORK. (Roman Catholic.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nFARMERS-GENERAL OF THE WAGES OF SIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the Police Captain was the Pantata of the Gambler, he was the\r\nFarmer-General of the Houses of Ill-fame in his Precinct. His duty, as\r\ndefined by the law which he had sworn to enforce, was clear. He was bound\r\nto close every disorderly house in his jurisdiction. His practice was to\r\nlet them all run--for a consideration. The Strange Woman, that pathetic\r\nand tragic figure in the streets of all great cities, whose house from of\r\nold was said to be the Way of Hell, going down into the Chambers of Death,\r\nexcited in the Police Captain only the sentiment of rapacity. In his eyes\r\nshe was merely an asset in his farm, and one of the most valuable.\r\n\r\nIt was when the Lexow Committee approached this part of the investigation\r\nthat they found the greatest difficulties placed in their way.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the inquiry the Police Department preserved an\r\nattitude of animosity to the Lexow Committee. This was only natural,\r\nconsidering that the Committee was engaged in bringing to light all the\r\nmisdeeds of the Department for the last three or four years. The Committee\r\nwas protected by law, and supported by public opinion; nevertheless, the\r\npolice eagerly seized every opportunity that was offered them in order to\r\nembarrass the Committee’s investigations, by intimidating witnesses, and\r\nsometimes by spiriting them away altogether. It was proved that policemen\r\nhad gone round to the keepers of disorderly houses, and had begged them to\r\nrefuse to appear, or to refuse to testify, promising as an inducement\r\nthat, if they would hold their tongues, they should be allowed to run\r\ntheir houses freely without interference from any one. The tune which all\r\nthe policemen sang was “Wait till the clouds roll by.” The Lexow Committee\r\nwas but a creature of to-day, while the Police Department was one of the\r\npermanent institutions of the city.\r\n\r\n“These fellows have got no pull,” said the police. “You lie low for a\r\ntime, and we will protect you.”\r\n\r\nWhen this argument failed, they resorted to menace, threatening to close\r\nup the house, to fling the keepers into gaol, and occasionally, when these\r\nthreats failed, they resorted to personal violence.\r\n\r\nThe Committee, speaking of the terrorism which was employed by the police\r\nin order to prevent witnesses testifying, said:--\r\n\r\n    In the course of the inquiry, a man rushed into the session of your\r\n    Committee, fresh from an assault made upon him by a notorious\r\n    politician and two policemen, and with fear depicted upon his\r\n    countenance, threw himself upon the mercy of the Committee and asked\r\n    its protection, insisting that he knew of no court and of no place\r\n    where he could in safety go and obtain protection from his\r\n    persecutors.--Vol. i., pp. 25, 26.\r\n\r\nThe most distinguished exploit of the police, however, during the whole of\r\nthe inquiry was the spiriting away of the French Madam, Matilda Hermann,\r\none of the most notable keepers of disorderly houses in the City of New\r\nYork. When it was known that the Committee was after her, and that Madam,\r\nwho had been plundered to the bone by the police, was by no means\r\nindisposed to “squeal”--to quote the expressive vernacular of the\r\nDepartment--there was a consultation among the police authorities as to\r\nwhat measures should be taken to close her mouth. A considerable number of\r\npeople in the same way of business had been induced to migrate to Chicago,\r\nwhere they remained waiting until such time as the Committee adjourned,\r\nbut Madam Hermann was too dangerous a witness. She required special\r\ntreatment. A purse was made up for her by the police, which, when the\r\nsubscription closed, amounted to 1,700 dollars. She was then under\r\nsubpœna, and was expected before the Committee the next day.\r\n\r\nAt midnight, a police officer in plain clothes came to her house, bundled\r\nher into a carriage in such hot haste that she had not time to complete\r\nher toilet, and whisked her off no one knew where. For some weeks the\r\npolice appeared to have triumphed, but after a time the Committee were\r\nable to get upon her track. She had been taken first to New Jersey, and\r\nthen from New Jersey had been railroaded through to Canada. From thence,\r\nafter moving about from place to place, she had been taken to a Western\r\ncity, where at last she was run to ground.\r\n\r\nWhen the agents of the Committee found her she expressed no disinclination\r\nto return to New York and testify. She had fulfilled her part of the\r\nbargain in keeping out of the way as long as she could. Now that she was\r\ndiscovered she was willing to return. In great triumph she was escorted\r\nback to the city. In order to prevent any attempt at rescue, an additional\r\nstaff of men were sent to Philadelphia to meet her. The precaution was\r\ntimely, for as soon as they arrived at Jersey City a last desperate\r\nattempt was made by the police to prevent her evidence being taken.\r\n\r\nShe was in the custody of the Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms of the Senate, who\r\nhad a party of resolute men in his train. But notwithstanding this, no\r\nsooner had the party arrived in Jersey City than they were set upon by the\r\nJersey police, who treated them with the greatest roughness. They\r\nthreatened to break their faces, hustled them about, and endeavoured in\r\nthe _mêlée_ to get Madam Hermann away. The Deputy Serjeant, however,\r\nstuck to his witness, and finally he, Madam Hermann, and all his men were\r\narrested, run into the station-house, and locked up.\r\n\r\nThe sensation which this occasioned can be imagined. Fortunately, the\r\nCommittee was in session, otherwise there is no knowing whether the daring\r\nattempt to seize and remove the witness might not have succeeded. The\r\nimmediate publicity, however, that was given to the case convinced the\r\npolice that the game was up. The Chief of the Police and the Police\r\nMagistrate refused to lend their aid in thwarting the ends of justice, and\r\nthe conspirators, led by a lawyer, who was also a senator of the State of\r\nNew Jersey, drew off their gang, and reluctantly allowed Madam Hermann to\r\nbe brought to New York. The story reads more like an episode from the\r\nMiddle Ages than an excerpt from the proceedings of a senatorial\r\ninvestigation in New York State in the last decade of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe French Madam, as she was called in the precinct, was evidently\r\nregarded by the police as a gold mine. She had three or four houses, with\r\nsome twenty-four or twenty-five girls, and was doing a flourishing\r\nbusiness. She paid the police altogether in the seven years that she was\r\nrunning the sum of over 30,000 dollars, or more than £6,000; _i.e._, this\r\nwoman alone yielded the police a revenue of nearly £1,000 a year. Part of\r\nthis money, it should be said, went to the lawyers, who shared it with the\r\npolice. Every time she was raided the policeman insisted upon her taking a\r\nlawyer, and told her that if she would take the lawyer of his choice, he\r\nwould not swear against her. He would swear that he was not sure of her\r\nidentity. This she did, and she was discharged. Every time she took a\r\nlawyer she had to pay from £35 to £80, and the lawyer always told her that\r\nhe only got part of the money, as the rest of it went to fix her\r\ndetectives. Her evidence on this point was very emphatic. Whether she paid\r\n200 dollars or 100 dollars, the lawyer only got 50 dollars; the rest went\r\nup to the police.\r\n\r\n    Q. Were you told by the lawyers that that must go up?\r\n\r\n    A. From the smallest lawyer to the biggest lawyer: every lawyer was\r\n    the same.\r\n\r\n    Q. And every lawyer whose name you have mentioned told you that they\r\n    had to give up to the police part of their fees they got from you?\r\n\r\n    A. Every one of them.--Vol. iv., p. 4,179.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hermann first went into the business from being employed as a\r\ndressmaker for the inmates of disorderly houses. She gradually added house\r\nto house, until she had four houses and twenty-five girls. She had to pay\r\nthe police sometimes as much as £200 initiation fee before opening a\r\nhouse, and then from £60 to £100 per annum as protection money.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these payments, every policeman in the street received a\r\ndollar or two whenever he chose to ask for it. The method of exacting\r\nthis payment was very simple. The policeman said nothing, but simply stood\r\nin front of the door. Of course, no one entered the house as long as he\r\nwas there; therefore, as counsel put it, “in order to induce him to take a\r\nlittle exercise round the block, he was presented with a two-dollar bill.”\r\nThis little episode used to occur about twice or thrice a week.\r\nNotwithstanding these payments, she made too much money to be left alone.\r\nShe was raided twice in 1890, and on the first occasion the police\r\nextracted the sum of £200 before she was allowed to reopen her premises.\r\nThe next year she was prosecuted, and had to forfeit £200 bail in order to\r\navoid a threatened imprisonment. Immediately after her return she was\r\nagain arrested, and had to pay £200 to the detective, who shared it with a\r\nhigh official at the Central Police Headquarters.\r\n\r\nHer business was so profitable that she admitted in Court that she had\r\nbeen making between £2,000 and £3,000 a year, of which sum the police and\r\nthe police lawyers seem to have had a good half. On one occasion, when she\r\nhad paid £100 to her lawyer to get off with a fine of £20, she was\r\nliberated on the Friday and re-opened her house on the Saturday.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the way in which they fleeced their unfortunate victim,\r\nshe was still subjected, like all her class, to occasional outbursts of\r\nbrutality on the part of members of the force.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Parkhurst was making his tour of investigation through “the\r\navenues of our municipal Inferno,” the wardman was sent round the district\r\nto the keepers of all the disorderly houses to describe Dr. Parkhurst, and\r\nto tell them to look out for him in case he appeared at their house.\r\nAnother experience was when she took a house in West Twenty-third Street\r\nto start it as an ordinary boarding-house. She had furnished it, and was\r\ntrying to let it. Promptly the wardman of the precinct came to her and\r\nasked her “whether she did not know the law of the precinct.” “You know\r\nvery well,” he said, “that you cannot move in here until you see the\r\nCaptain.” And then this estimable officer did all he could to convince her\r\nthat it was idle trying to run a decent boarding-house, and she had much\r\nbetter open the house in the regular way. The initiation fee would be\r\n£400, £200 down and the rest to stand over until business was good. There\r\nwas to be a further payment of protection money, amounting to £240 a year.\r\nShe had not much ready money, whereupon the wardman suggested that she\r\nmight pawn her diamonds, for, said he, “the Captain is very bad off for\r\nmoney.”\r\n\r\nAnother very amusing thing which came out in her evidence was the argument\r\nused by a detective named Zimmerman to induce her to give him £10. He got\r\na couple of pounds one day, and came back the next, asking for another £2.\r\nShe objected, but he said, “I will be a good friend to you. I have lots\r\nof pull, and my brother has shaved the Superintendent for twenty years,\r\nand I get a great deal; I have a pull on that account.” It is an\r\ninteresting illustration of the way in which everything was turned to\r\naccount for the levying of blackmail. But we could hardly get lower than\r\nthis. The origin of pulls is mysterious; but to have a pull because your\r\nbrother shaves the Superintendent is a very mysterious foundation for\r\npolitical influence. It is, however, but one among the many things in the\r\nevidence that remind us of Turkey. The barber of the Grand Vizier is no\r\ndoubt a much more influential person than many a Pasha; and detective\r\nZimmerman was probably right in believing that his pull was good.\r\nEverywhere, and at every turn, we are confronted by the omnipresent\r\n“pull.” It confirms in the strongest way what Mr. Godkin said long ago as\r\nto the city governments in America being a system of government by\r\npulls:--\r\n\r\n    In the ward in which he lives, the foreign immigrant never comes\r\n    across any sign of moral right or moral wrong, human or divine\r\n    justice. He then perceives very soon that, as far as he is concerned,\r\n    ours is not a government of laws, but a government of “pulls.” When he\r\n    goes into the only court of justice of which he has any knowledge, he\r\n    is told he must have a “pull” on the magistrate or he will fare badly.\r\n    When he opens a liquor-store, he is told he must have a “pull” on the\r\n    police in order not to be “raided” or arrested for violation of a\r\n    mysterious something which he hears called “law.” He learns from those\r\n    of his countrymen who have been here longer than he that, in order to\r\n    come into possession of this “pull,” he must secure the friendship of\r\n    the district leader.--_North American Review_, 1890.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hermann was only one among a number of other Madams who appeared\r\nbefore the Committee, but none succeeded in exciting so much sympathy on\r\nthe part of the senators. The scandalous way in which the poor woman had\r\nbeen fleeced, and bullied, and ultimately reduced to penury by the very\r\nofficials to whom she was paying protection money, roused the indignation\r\nof the Committee. If the police had protected her in return for their fee,\r\nit would have been a different matter, but, as Senator O’Connor remarked,\r\nindignantly, in addition to paying the monthly tax, and the initiation\r\nfees, raids were got up as an excuse to enable a policeman or a class of\r\ncriminal lawyers to extort money out of her. Senator Pound remarked that\r\nit was the practice to protect such women until they became wealthy, and\r\nthen squeeze it out of them and leave them destitute. They say that there\r\nis “honour among thieves,” but there seems to be none with the policemen\r\nwho handled Mrs. Hermann.\r\n\r\nAnother Madam, whose case attracted considerable attention, was one\r\nAugusta Thurow, whose misfortunes brought her into intimate relations with\r\nSenator Roesch, and led to the appearance of that redoubtable politician\r\nin the witness-box. The relations between her and the Captain of the\r\nPrecinct seem to have been on straight business lines. About a dollar a\r\nmonth for each girl in the house was the regular tariff. When beginning\r\nbusiness she went round to see the Captain and told him that she was\r\nwilling to do the right thing, but she had not much money, and could not\r\npay a very heavy initiation fee. He met her fairly, and said that he would\r\nsend the wardman round, and she was to do what he told her. When the\r\nwardman came he said, “You wait until after the election, and, after the\r\nelection is over, you start right in and do business.” After the election\r\nday he returned and said, “Now we will come to terms. Give me twenty-five\r\ndollars a month and there will be no trouble either for you or for me.”\r\nBusiness went on smoothly until one day she received a summons to go and\r\nsee the Captain. When she got there she found a number of other ladies and\r\ngentlemen of her own profession at the station-house. On being admitted\r\ninto the Captain’s presence she thought he wanted money. He replied, “I am\r\nnot supposed to take money, but you can give me the money;” whereupon she\r\nhanded him twenty-five dollars. He then told her that he had sent for her,\r\nnot in order to collect the protection fee, which was the duty of the\r\nwardman, but to give her a friendly warning that he had received orders\r\nfrom the Central Office to close all the disorderly houses in the\r\nprecinct. He hoped, therefore, that she would do her business very\r\ncarefully, otherwise they might raid her from the Central Office. This was\r\nan incident which was constantly occurring. The Central Office, stirred up\r\nby newspaper reports, or by the representations of decent citizens, issues\r\norders for enforcing the law. The police captains, instead of executing\r\nthe orders of the Central Office in the spirit as well as in the letter,\r\nsend word round to all those concerned warning them to be on the alert. By\r\nthis means the Captain of the Precinct effectually nullifies the orders\r\nissued from the Central Office, and, even if the Central Office make a\r\nraid on their own account, they find nothing to seize.\r\n\r\nIt was shortly after this visit that Mrs. Thurow made her first\r\nacquaintance with a redoubtable policeman of the name of Hoch. Of all the\r\ncollectors or wardmen who figure in the evidence, Hoch enjoys the most\r\nconspicuous notoriety. He was no sooner entrusted with the collections in\r\nthat district than he insisted upon raising the fees for protection. “A\r\nranch like that,” he said, “is worth seventy-five dollars a month, and\r\nhere you are only paying twenty-five dollars, and give me only five\r\ndollars, although you promised me ten dollars.”\r\n\r\n“Hoch,” she replied, “I cannot afford it.”\r\n\r\n    Q. What did he say when you said you could not afford it?\r\n\r\n    A. He says, “You have got the house, and why don’t you make money? It\r\n    is your own fault; and that house is situated in the right spot, and\r\n    you can do all the business you want and we won’t interfere with you,\r\n    but you must do better than this.”\r\n\r\n    Q. Did he make any threats then to pull you, if you did not pay a\r\n    higher rate?\r\n\r\n    A. He said, certainly, if I could not do better than that, he would\r\n    raid the house.--Vol. i., p. 1,055.\r\n\r\nThis alarmed the Madam, and off she went to her husband, who was sent in\r\nquest of Judge Roesch, the leader of the Seventh Assembly District, an\r\nex-senator. “I will go and see somebody, and fix the thing up,” said\r\nRoesch. “But it will cost about one hundred dollars.” The money was paid,\r\nand she did business right away.\r\n\r\nSome time after this she was pulled by another detective. She expostulated\r\nagainst the injustice of being run in, although she was paying protection\r\nmoney, whereupon the detective remarked sententiously, “Somehow or other\r\nyou did not hitch with the Boss.” She went round to the station-house, to\r\nfind out what was wrong. The Captain told her that she had to find another\r\nhouse in the precinct, and he would protect her, but he would not stand\r\nthe house in which she was any longer. The cause of this she discovered\r\nwhen she was told that she could not open the new house until she paid an\r\ninitiation fee of £200 for the Captain, and £50 for Hoch.\r\n\r\nIt is not quite clear how it was that she got at cross purposes with the\r\npolice, but one remark made by Hoch would seem to indicate the existence\r\nof an incipient jealousy between the police and Tammany Hall.\r\n\r\nAugusta Thurow told the Committee that she said to Hoch:--\r\n\r\n    “I cannot afford to pay more than I am paying; you people treat me so\r\n    terribly, and I had to go to Roesch, and I had to pay him for his\r\n    trouble.” He said, “What did you pay him?” I said “Never mind what I\r\n    paid him.” He says, “That is how it is with you; you people get us\r\n    angry; you give money to the politicians that belong to the\r\n    police.”--Vol. i., p. 1,080.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman asked her to repeat exactly what he said; and she answered,\r\n“He said, ‘You give the money to the politicians that ought to go to the\r\npolice. Are the politicians doing for you, or are we doing for you?’”\r\n\r\nThe evidence of the two Madams, and of a great number of other keepers of\r\ndisorderly houses, proved beyond all gainsaying that the police were in\r\npartnership with the prostitutes, and that the firstfruits of the harvest\r\nof shame were paid to the Captain of the Precinct. The Report of the Lexow\r\nCommittee thus sums up the result of their investigations:--\r\n\r\n    The testimony upon this subject, taken as a whole, establishes\r\n    conclusively the fact that this variety of vice was regularly and\r\n    systematically licensed by the police of the city. The system had\r\n    reached such a perfection in detail that the inmates of the several\r\n    houses were numbered and classified, and a rateable charge placed upon\r\n    each proprietor in proportion to the number of inmates, or in cases of\r\n    houses of assignation the number of rooms occupied and the prices\r\n    charged, reduced to a monthly rate, which was collected within a few\r\n    days of the first of each month during the year. This was true\r\n    apparently with reference to all disorderly houses except in the case\r\n    of a few specially favoured ones. The prices ran from twenty-five to\r\n    fifty dollars monthly, depending upon the considerations aforesaid,\r\n    besides fixed sums for the opening of new houses or the resumption of\r\n    “business” in old or temporarily abandoned houses, and for “initiation\r\n    fees” designed as an additional gratuity to captains upon their\r\n    transfer into new precincts. The established fee for opening and\r\n    initiation appears to have been five hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n    Thus it appears that transfers of captains, ostensibly made for the\r\n    purpose of reform and of enforcing the discontinuance of the practice,\r\n    the prevalence of which seems to have been generally understood,\r\n    resulted only in the extortion from these criminal places of\r\n    additional blackmail.\r\n\r\n    As an evidence of the perfect system to which this traffic has been\r\n    reduced, your Committee refers to that part of the testimony which\r\n    shows that in more than one instance the police officials refused to\r\n    allow keepers of disorderly houses to discontinue their business,\r\n    threatening them with persecution if they attempted so to do, and\r\n    substantially expounding the proposition that they were for the\r\n    purpose of making money to share with the police. As an evidence of\r\n    the extraordinary conditions to which this system had given rise, it\r\n    is proper to call your attention to the fact that in a number of cases\r\n    women, who, as keepers of disorderly houses, had paid thousands of\r\n    dollars for police protection, had become reduced to the verge of\r\n    starvation, while those who had exacted blackmail from them were\r\n    living in luxury in houses that had been furnished out of the earnings\r\n    of these women, or they were wearing ornaments of jewelry purchased by\r\n    them; and even the furniture of their houses had been paid for by\r\n    those whom they had protected in the commission of crime.\r\n\r\n    The evidence establishes, furthermore, that not only the proprietors\r\n    of disorderly houses paid for their illegal privileges, but the\r\n    outcasts of society paid patrolmen on post for permission to solicit\r\n    on the public highways, dividing their gains with them, and, often, as\r\n    appears by proof, when brought before the police magistrates and\r\n    committed to the penitentiary for disorderly conduct in default of\r\n    bail, they compounded their sentence, and secured bail by paying ten\r\n    dollars or fifteen dollars to the clerk of the court, or his agents,\r\n    and were then released again to ply their calling and to become\r\n    victimised as before.\r\n\r\n    The evidence furthermore shows that in some of the houses of the\r\n    character described, visitors were systematically robbed, and when\r\n    they made complaint at the station-house the man detailed to examine\r\n    into the charge failed to arrest the perpetrator, and frightened the\r\n    victim off by threats, and then returned and received his\r\n    compensation, an equal division of the plunder between the thief and\r\n    the officer.\r\n\r\n    The testimony taken as a whole conclusively establishes that the\r\n    social evil was, and probably still is, fostered and protected by the\r\n    police of the city, even to the extent of inducing its votaries to\r\n    continue their illegal practices, maintaining substantially a\r\n    partnership with them in the traffic, absorbing the largest part of\r\n    the resulting profit.--Vol. i., pp. 33-36.\r\n\r\nThe most startling statement in the whole Report is that which is\r\ncontained in the paragraph just quoted. From this it appears that the\r\npolice were not merely toll-keepers on the way to hell, but if by any\r\nchance the Strange Woman wished to forsake her chamber of death, they\r\nthrust her back into it. What was it to them that she might wish to save\r\nher soul alive out of the pit? Her duty was to stay there and earn dollars\r\nfor the police. Were they not the Farmers-General of the Wages of Sin?\r\n\r\nMrs. Blood, a keeper of houses of ill-fame, was compelled by a Police\r\nCaptain to purchase the house of Madame Perot at some 10,000 dollars above\r\nits value, to carry it on as a house of prostitution (vol. v., p. 5,414).\r\nAnother Captain smashed in the face of a man named Galingo because he had\r\ntaken a house in which the Captain wished to instal a brothel-keeper from\r\nwhom he expected to get £200 opening fee and £10 a month afterwards (vol.\r\niv., p. 4,487). In other cases, witnesses who had intended to leave the\r\nbusiness were compelled to go on running by threat of being raided and\r\nruined if they dared to think of ceasing to earn fees for the police. The\r\npolice had come to believe that they had a vested interest in every\r\nbrothel; and when a keeper proposed to quit the business, he felt like an\r\nIrish tenant who is being evicted without compensation for disturbance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MADAM HERMANN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GANSEVOORT MARKET, NEW YORK.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n“ALL SORTS AND CONDITIONS OF MEN.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“After all,” some readers will say, “what does it matter? These people are\r\nall outlaws; they deserve what they get, whatever it is.” But the net of\r\nthe New York police was exceeding wide, and the mesh was exceeding fine,\r\nand no class of the community escaped. As the sun riseth upon the evil and\r\nthe just, so the blackmailer of the Police Department marked as his prey\r\nthe honest and virtuous as well as the vicious and criminal. The Lexow\r\nCommittee report:--\r\n\r\n    The evidence of blackmail and extortion does not rest alone on the\r\n    evidence of criminals or persons accused of the commission of crime.\r\n    It has been abundantly proven that bootblacks, push-cart, and fruit\r\n    vendors, as well as keepers of soda-water stands, corner grocerymen,\r\n    sailmakers with flag poles extending a few feet beyond the place which\r\n    they occupy, boxmakers, provision dealers, wholesale drygoods\r\n    merchants, and builders, who are compelled at times to use the\r\n    sidewalk and street, steamboat and steamship companies, who require\r\n    police service on their docks, those who give public exhibitions, and\r\n    in fact all persons, and all classes of persons whose business is\r\n    subject to the observation of the police, or who may be reported as\r\n    violating ordinances, or who may require the aid of the police, all\r\n    have to contribute in substantial sums to the vast amounts which flow\r\n    into the station-houses, and which, after leaving something of the\r\n    nature of a deposit, then flow on higher. The commerce of the port\r\n    even is taxed when the functions of the police department touch it, so\r\n    that the shippers are compelled to submit to exactions in the city of\r\n    New York that they do not meet with in any other port.--Vol. i., p.\r\n    42.\r\n\r\nThe chief sufferers, of course, were the poor and those who had no helper.\r\nThey were as much at the mercy of their oppressors as the French people\r\nbefore the Revolution were at the mercy of their nobles. Again and again\r\nthe senators expressed their amazement that a population so harassed and\r\noppressed did not rise in revolt. Their wrongs certainly were immeasurably\r\ngreater than those which led to the Tea-party in Boston Harbour and the\r\nDeclaration of Independence. The chief abuse, the great grievance, might\r\nbe summed up in one sentence. There was no justice for the poor. A witness\r\nof the name of Collins, speaking of the notorious Alderman, Silver Dollar\r\nSmith, and the gang by which he reigned supreme on the east side, said:--\r\n\r\n    Smith has a regular organisation; you couldn’t convict them people\r\n    neither; you couldn’t convict them people in Court neither. It is an\r\n    organisation to represent witnesses to condemn people if they have no\r\n    money. If they have money to give, they are innocent; they perjure\r\n    themselves if they pay money.--Vol. v., p. 4,894.\r\n\r\nBut it is not necessary to go beyond the finding of the Lexow Committee in\r\ntheir official Report:--\r\n\r\n    The co-ordination of all the departments of city government, under the\r\n    sway of the dominant Democratic faction in that city, has produced a\r\n    harmony of action operating so as to render it impossible for\r\n    oppressed citizens, particularly those in the humbler walks of life,\r\n    the poor and needy, to obtain redress or relief from the oppression or\r\n    the tyranny of the police. Their path to justice was completely\r\n    blocked. It is not credible that the abuses shown to exist have been\r\n    the creation of but a short time. It is clear from the evidence that\r\n    abuses have existed for many years back; that they have been\r\n    constantly increasing through the years, but that they did not reach\r\n    their full and perfect development until Tammany Hall obtained\r\n    absolute control of the city government, and under that control the\r\n    practices which have been shown conclusively before your Committee,\r\n    were brought into a well regulated and comprehensive system, conducted\r\n    apparently upon business principles.--Vol. i., p. 37.\r\n\r\nThe way in which the criminals in uniform and on the judge’s bench acted\r\nwhen by any chance they could punish any one for doing what they\r\nthemselves were doing all the time has already been remarked in the case\r\nof Captain Creedon, who was the only captain suspended by the Police Board\r\nduring the whole investigation. A more cruel case was that of Karl Werner.\r\nThis man had tried to bribe a policeman with five dollars, and was\r\npromptly arrested. Every difficulty was placed in the way of letting him\r\nhave bail. At last the Court promised to accept bail, and a professional\r\nbondsman offered to give bonds for 100 dollars. His wife raised 95\r\ndollars, and because she could not raise the additional five on the spot,\r\nthe bondsman confiscated the 95 dollars, and the poor wretch was sent to\r\ngaol. The professional bondsman is one of the worst of the harpies who\r\nprey upon the unfortunate. Mr. Goff, who reported this incident to the\r\nCommission, deplored the impotence to save the victim of the bondsman and\r\nthe police. “It is,” he said, “simply another of the many instances of the\r\nterrible reign of terrorism” (vol. iv., p. 4,225).\r\n\r\nYet at the very time when Werner was being treated so harshly, the police\r\nwere collecting blackmail by thousands of dollars every week. At first the\r\nCommittee was incredulous. The Chairman asked once:--\r\n\r\n    Do you conscientiously believe that, notwithstanding these\r\n    revelations, notwithstanding the situation that we are brought face to\r\n    face with now, and what has occurred, there are police officers to-day\r\n    in this city who accept blackmail?\r\n\r\nBut he was speedily convinced that the revelations and the terrors of\r\nexposure had only reduced the amount of the blackmail levied by reducing\r\nthe number of those who could be compelled to pay. The evidence of Captain\r\nMeakin’s collector, Edward Shalvey, was conclusive on this point. He swore\r\nin the witness-box that he had gone on collecting, without making the\r\nslightest change, right down to September:--\r\n\r\n    Q. You collected from these several places, liquor dealers, policy\r\n    shops, and houses of ill-fame as you did under the previous captain?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n    Q. Did you ever meet with any refusal to pay from people engaged in\r\n    this class of business, or did they all pay as matter of course?\r\n\r\n    A. They all paid as matter of course.\r\n\r\n    Q. So that, officer, even beneath the terrible frown of the Lexow\r\n    Committee, the collections went on just the same?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n    Q. The old, old story continued, is that not so?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n    Q. And while, as a matter of fact, while there were exposures made and\r\n    being testified to before this Committee since last April or May,\r\n    right along the collections continued unbroken, did they not?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir; not to such an extent.\r\n\r\n    Q. And the captains took the money in the same way?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n    Chairman Lexow: It seems incredible!--Vol. i., pp. 5,407-8.\r\n\r\n“It is a tough old world, sir,” as the old stager remarked to an\r\nenthusiastic young Reformer, “and takes a deal of moving.” It is a very\r\ntough old world, and in the whole hemisphere there are few places tougher\r\nthan New York.\r\n\r\nThe contributions paid by contractors to Mr. Croker can easily be\r\nunderstood. One Michael Moran, who was engaged in the towboat business,\r\ntowing garbage under the Street Cleaning Department, made various\r\nsubscriptions of from £10 to £30 to Tammany Hall. He was asked why he did\r\nso. He replied that Mr. Croker was the treasurer of the organisation he\r\nwas doing some work for. “Tammany Hall, you mean?” asked the Chairman.\r\n“Well, I guess so,” replied Moran. “Don’t you know there is a distinction\r\nbetween the City and the organisation known as Tammany Hall?” asked the\r\nChairman. There was no reply. But Moran evidently did not. Tammany Hall\r\nwas the organisation that stood for the City. For him it was the City, and\r\nMoran said to subscribe to Tammany was the natural feeling amongst\r\neverybody that worked for the City; “one done it, and I didn’t want to be\r\nleft behind by anybody else; I thought I would hold my own end up”:--\r\n\r\n    Q. Did any one suggest to you the advisability of giving up this\r\n    money?\r\n\r\n    A. I have had conversations with other men that were in the employ of\r\n    the City, and we compared notes occasionally to know what was done,\r\n    and how we could keep ourselves solid.\r\n\r\nNo political contributions were made by Moran before Tammany came into\r\npower. So the Chairman asked:--\r\n\r\n    Q. How is it then that when the Department changed you felt called\r\n    upon to send a cheque to Mr. Croker?\r\n\r\n    A. Well, because I didn’t think I could go on and do the amount of\r\n    business I had for the City without recognising the people that were\r\n    in power.\r\n\r\nIn 1892, when the Presidential Election was on, Moran doubled his\r\nsubscription. Why was that? He replied:--\r\n\r\n    I compared notes with somebody in the same business that I was in\r\n    myself, and found out somebody was paying a little more than I did,\r\n    and I was afraid somebody in my line of business would put in a little\r\n    more and I would get left.--Vol. v., pp. 4,912-6.\r\n\r\nWhen once an evil system has got itself established, innumerable other\r\ninfluences combine to render its extirpation extremely difficult. The\r\nCommittee was much scandalised by discovering that for premises whose\r\nlicence had been cancelled for immorality, a new licence was granted\r\nalmost immediately. But when the President of the Excise Board was asked\r\nto explain, he said:--\r\n\r\n    There came into consideration property interests; we found that if\r\n    licences were refused for places where business was carried on, that\r\n    the banks were affected who had loaned money on mortgages, persons who\r\n    had loaned on mortgages, the banks who had notes of parties in\r\n    business; the rents went to the support of persons who depended upon\r\n    them solely; the tax commissioners of the city protested to the Board\r\n    of Excise against the refusal to license premises, because it reduces\r\n    the value of property, and for that reason reduces the taxable values,\r\n    and affected the city in that way; real estate agents and other\r\n    persons interested, and owners of property came to us and protested at\r\n    the start that we ought not to refuse to allow a reputable business to\r\n    be carried on on any premises, because they had been improperly\r\n    conducted before.--Vol. iv., p. 4,379.\r\n\r\nAnd it came to pass that no sooner was a saloon closed for vice or crime\r\nthan it was opened again with a fresh licence.\r\n\r\nThe most mournful and tragic part of all these stories of oppression is\r\nthat which relates to the treatment of the forlorn and desolate women who\r\nhave no money with which to bribe the police. For them there is no mercy.\r\nThe theory of the police, as we have seen, seems to have been that\r\nprostitutes existed for the purpose of raising revenue for the force. The\r\nwomen of the streets were the irregular tax-gatherers of the Department.\r\nTheir vice was not merely connived at, but actively encouraged, so long as\r\nthe police received their stipulated proportion of the wages of shame.\r\n\r\nThe women were the bondslaves of the Administration. By law they had no\r\nright to ply for hire; but, in consideration of the payment of a regular\r\nransom, they were left free to earn their precarious living.\r\n\r\n“This is a phase,” said Mr. Goff, “and a revolting phase, of a custom that\r\nexists in New York. I suppose it is the lowest form of oppression and\r\ncorruption that possibly could be conceived by the human mind; and that\r\nis, a tax upon these unfortunate women in the streets at night; for they\r\nwill not be allowed to walk the streets at night unless they pay so much\r\nto the officer, and this has been the custom in many districts of this\r\ncity for years.”--Vol. iv., p. 3,617.\r\n\r\nThe tariff varied.[1] On some profitable beats, the licence fee was fifty\r\ncents per night. But as a general rule the rate for “cruising” was a\r\ndollar a week. So long as she paid she was all right--always with the\r\nunderstanding that the policeman was to be free to arrest her if she was\r\ncomplained of by any whom she molested. Irregulars--occasional clandestine\r\nunfortunates--were, of course, regarded as interlopers and hunted down\r\nremorselessly. The zeal of the policeman, which was not stirred in the\r\nleast by the breach of the law, rose to white heat when a woman who had\r\nnot paid her fees attempted to pick up customers.\r\n\r\n    [1] The following table of some of the rates enforced by the police\r\n    may be found convenient for reference:--\r\n\r\n        Pool-rooms from £10 to £60 per month.\r\n        Policy shops from £4 per month.\r\n        Liquor dealers, 8s. per month.\r\n        Prostitutes, outside, from 4s. a week to 2s. per night.\r\n        Prostitutes, inside, 4s. per week.\r\n        Houses of ill-fame from £2 to £10 per month.\r\n        Ditto. Initiation fee on opening, from £100 to £400.\r\n        Price of Police appointment, £60.\r\n          \"   of a Sergeant’s post, £300.\r\n          \"   of Captaincy, £3,000.\r\n\r\nIn theory, in New York--and, alas, in many other great cities--the right\r\nof a woman to freedom from arbitrary arrest without process of trial, and\r\nto redress for wrongful arrest, is absolute. In practice it does not\r\nexist. Every poor woman who is out after dark is liable to be arrested by\r\na policeman, and to a woman friendless and forlorn there is written over\r\nthe portals of every police-station, “All hope abandon ye who enter here.”\r\nBefore the Police Justice, the policeman’s word goes. No corroborative\r\nevidence seems to have been demanded in New York. As one worthy testified\r\nbefore the Committee, he made arrests on general principles, and swore\r\nthat his victim was loitering for purposes of prostitution. It was not\r\nnecessary that she should commit any overt act, that she should molest any\r\none, or that any citizen should complain of her molestation. It was enough\r\nthat she should be loitering in the street. The oath of the policeman as\r\nto her intent settled her fate. A hurried gabble of words in a crowded\r\ncourt, and she was packed off to gaol.\r\n\r\nThis is the besetting sin of all attempts to keep the streets clear of\r\nimmoral women by giving men, more or less immoral themselves, absolute\r\nliberty to arrest any woman whom they please to say is loitering for\r\npurposes of prostitution. It was with a flush of pride that I came all\r\nunawares upon a reference made before the Lexow Committee to the case of\r\nMiss Cass, which made the name of Endacott a byword and a reproach in\r\nLondon some dozen years ago. Counsel had not got the story quite right.\r\nHis version curiously mixed up the Trafalgar Square agitation with the\r\narrest of the dressmaker in Regent Circus, but he had the main idea quite\r\nright. Scotland Yard and Mr. Matthews hit the poor girl a foul blow before\r\nthe incident was ended, but it was a welcome thing to find that their\r\nbelated vengeance had failed to silence the reverberations of indignation\r\nevoked by her scandalous arrest.\r\n\r\nAmericans and foreigners are often shocked at the state of London streets.\r\nMr. Croker, I remember, expressed himself as being much horrified at the\r\nstate of Piccadilly at midnight. But better a thousand times have the\r\nscandal of our streets than place the liberty of all women at the mercy of\r\nthe police. The arrests of women fell 50 per cent. in London after the\r\nuproar that was made about Miss Cass, and they are not likely to rise so\r\nlong as the authorities insist upon the most just and salutary rule then\r\nintroduced, that no woman shall be arrested for molesting by solicitation,\r\nunless the citizen who is molested is willing to give evidence next day in\r\nthe police-court to that effect. The right of a human being to walk about\r\nthe streets, to loiter about the streets, does not depend, and ought not\r\nto depend, upon the chastity of that individual. But if that principle\r\nwere to be adopted as a principle of police action, it ought in justice to\r\nbe applied impartially to both sexes.\r\n\r\nSome very scandalous instances of the arbitrary arrest of innocent women,\r\nand their consignment to prison on the uncorroborated oath of a policeman,\r\nwere brought before the Committee. The case of Ettie Kelter is one\r\ninstance of the kind of thing that follows inevitably from making the\r\npoliceman practically at once sole accuser and sole judge of the right of\r\na woman to be at large in the streets.\r\n\r\nEttie Kelter was a young married woman of unimpeachable character. She had\r\nlived in Albany until August, 1894, when she came to live in New York. One\r\nSaturday evening in the following month she went out shopping, and being a\r\nstranger in the city she lost her way. She asked a gentleman to direct her\r\nto her destination. He did so. She took the wrong turning, so he called\r\nafter telling her where she should go. She had hardly taken a few steps in\r\nthe right direction before a young man--a policeman in plain\r\nclothes--seized her arm and dragged her off to the police-station. There\r\nhe gave her in charge, declaring he had known her for years. It was in\r\nvain she protested she had never been in the city till the previous month.\r\nShe was removed under arrest to another police-station, where she was\r\nlocked up in a cell with a prostitute. She was terrified. She had been\r\ndragged through the street at a great rate, and no sooner was she in the\r\ncell than a blood-vessel burst. The blood gushed from her nose and mouth,\r\nscaring her companion, who thought she was bleeding to death. The blood\r\nstreamed over the floor of the cell. But all the efforts of her companion\r\nfailed to attract the attention of the policeman or the matron. She\r\nhammered at the door with a tin cup, but no one came. Not until the\r\nmorning did the officer come to release them from the bloody cell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STREET SCENE IN NEW YORK: OYSTER ROW.]\r\n\r\nPale, weak, distracted, almost fainting, Ettie Kelter was bundled into\r\ncourt in the midst of a crowd of the offscourings of the streets, and\r\nbrought up before Judge Hogan. She could not hear the charge, nor could\r\nshe make out what the Judge said, excepting that he said something about\r\nsoliciting. She did not know what it meant, but she passionately denied\r\nthat she was anything but a respectable married woman who had only just\r\ncome to New York. She might as well have held her peace. “Two months’\r\nimprisonment. After that, three hundred dollars bail good behaviour.” This\r\nwas Sunday morning. She was taken back to the cell, and her companion,\r\nwho had been sentenced to three months’ imprisonment, showed her a\r\nlawyer’s card. “Send for that man,” she said, “give him twenty dollars and\r\nhe will get you out.” Her companion did so and got out. Mrs. Kelter\r\nthought it would be better to send for her husband, who was employed as\r\nfireman on the emigrant ferryboat. The policeman who arrested her\r\nvolunteered to go and tell him. But when he saw Kelter the message the\r\npoliceman delivered was--\r\n\r\n“Now you have a good chance of divorce; I arrested your wife last night,\r\nand she has got two months on the Island.”\r\n\r\nShe tried to write to her husband. But she had only two cents, and they\r\nwould not give her a sheet of paper for less than five, nor would they\r\nsend it out for less than fifty cents.\r\n\r\nSo the poor woman was taken to the Island, and kept there in prison for\r\ntwenty-four days. At the end of that time her husband placed fifteen\r\ndollars in an envelope and handed it to Justice Hogan. His wife was\r\nreleased.\r\n\r\nAnd that kind of infamy was going on all the time. The way in which the\r\nunfortunates were driven from pillar to post and treated as mere cattle,\r\nto be fleeced and plundered, provoked a very remarkable protest from a\r\nPolice Captain who had sufficient humanity left in him to see the horror\r\nof the system which he had to administer. He was asked whose fault it was\r\nthat the social evil flourished to such an extent. He said it was the\r\nfault of the law:--\r\n\r\n    Q. The law itself?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir, if you give the women the same protection by law that you\r\n    do a mule and a dog you will do away with two-thirds of the houses of\r\n    prostitution and women of the street.--Vol. i., p. 5,198.\r\n\r\nIn reply to the Chairman he explained how it was that houses of ill-fame\r\nwere so much more difficult to deal with than gaming houses. He said:--\r\n\r\n    Because, Senator, you take the women to court, they are fined a few\r\n    dollars and turned out on the street again to go and get more money,\r\n    be re-arrested and pay again; the trouble is that prostitutes are\r\n    fined.\r\n\r\n    Q. Wasn’t that done with gamblers as well?\r\n\r\n    A. Well, you could get their paraphernalia and get them away, but you\r\n    couldn’t with the women; a prostitute should never be fined and her\r\n    money taken away from her; those women are not bad women until they\r\n    are made so; they are dragged off the street and dragged before the\r\n    court and their money taken away from them, and then drove out on the\r\n    street again; they are not bad until they are drove to it; now, there\r\n    were fully 30,000 arrests made from January 1st, 1876, to January 1st,\r\n    1878, in that little precinct alone, and I will venture to say there\r\n    were not 1,500 women arrested, but arrested over and over again.--Vol.\r\n    v., p. 5,213.\r\n\r\nHe was still further examined by Senator O’Connor:--\r\n\r\n    Q. I want to ask you a question or two: what do you mean to say, that\r\n    if people would give the women the same protection given to mules and\r\n    horses prostitutes would be fewer?\r\n\r\n    A. What I mean by it is this: when they are arrested, instead of\r\n    sending them to a magistrate to be fined and money taken from them,\r\n    send them to a reformatory and inquire into their history, and you\r\n    will find there are a great many of these people that you see lost in\r\n    the papers. As I say, the women are not bad naturally; it is only\r\n    where they are driven to it. If there was a reformatory and the money\r\n    taken from them and taken care of, and put the institution under good\r\n    women, good, proper persons to control that reformatory, and not abuse\r\n    them, not send them to jail or abuse them, but send them to a\r\n    reformatory. You will find some people from Massachusetts, some from\r\n    Ohio, some from somewhere else, some from Michigan; send them to their\r\n    homes, and if they are foreigners, who have not been here five years,\r\n    send them back to Europe, and you will find as a general thing that\r\n    the reason why the prostitutes and why the disorderly houses cannot be\r\n    overcome is that there is no care taken of them; they haven’t a friend\r\n    in the world. There is no friend to a prostitute; everybody bangs her,\r\n    everybody beats her; she is dragged into the station-house, taken to\r\n    court, fined, and thrown on the street to get more money and bring it\r\n    back.--Vol. i., p. 5,214.\r\n\r\nThese words deserve to be written up in letters of gold in every place\r\nwherever men discuss the question of abating this plague. It is the\r\nverdict of experience upon the habitual resource of the unthinking. “Go\r\nto, let us harry our sisters!” is the first and last word of most of those\r\nwho dream it is possible to promote the cause of morality by outraging the\r\nprinciples of justice.\r\n\r\nOf the system in New York there is only one good thing to be said. Bad as\r\nit was, it is infinitely better than the hideous abomination of the\r\nEuropean system of tolerated houses with their _police des mœurs_ and the\r\ncompulsory weekly surgical examination of their unhappy inmates. Better a\r\nthousand times even the rude, irregular tyrannies of Hoch and Koch, and\r\nall the diabolical gang of blackmailers, than elaborate all these infamies\r\ninto a legalised system stamped with the seal of the approval of the State\r\nand enforced by the dread penalties of the law.\r\n\r\nProstitution, everywhere hateful, is at least less intolerable when it is\r\nfree. When to the horrors of prostitution there is added the legalised\r\nslavery of the regulation system, you have indeed the sum of all\r\nvillainies, and the abomination that maketh desolate is at last set up in\r\nthe very holy of holies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nBELIAL ON THE JUDGMENT SEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effect of law, not law written in the Statute Book, but law\r\npractically enforced among the people, is to evolve a conscience. Not\r\nwithout deep true meaning was it said of old time “the law is a\r\nschoolmaster to bring us to Christ.” For it is the law, by its pains and\r\npenalties, which educates the individual as to the obligations of morality\r\nand the duty of well-doing. But in New York the universal practice of\r\npermitting all manner of abominations to run, provided the regular fee was\r\npaid to the police, acted as a direct depravation of public morals in\r\nfamiliarising the worst people in the city with a moral standard which was\r\nin itself a negation of morality. A woman of the name of Flora Waters, who\r\nkept a café with waitresses in a disreputable quarter, formulated with the\r\nutmost precision her belief that she was doing right because her money was\r\ntaken by the police:--\r\n\r\n    Q. You thought the business you were doing was not wrong?\r\n\r\n    A. I thought it was all right when I paid, because they all said the\r\n    money was going to----\r\n\r\n    Q. I only want to get her moral idea?\r\n\r\n    A. Because they told me the wardman did not keep the money and it goes\r\n    up higher, and it had to be that way, because it was not old in this\r\n    country, that people that sold liquors could keep waiters; but I\r\n    thought it was nothing wrong, and everybody told me the money went all\r\n    through, and everybody knew how it was worked.--Vol. ii., p. 1,363.\r\n\r\nHere we have plainly and simply set out the inevitable consequence of any\r\nsystem of regulation. When the police sanction anything, it is no longer\r\nwrong to practise it. The police-court is the only Sinai of the Slum.\r\n\r\nBad as the police were proved to be in many instances, they were gentlemen\r\ncompared with some of the Justices. The fact that such foul creatures were\r\npermitted to sit on the judgment seat and deal out sentences to men and\r\nwomen, the worst of whom were better than their judge, is the most\r\nmelancholy feature of the whole black, bad business. This is the innermost\r\ncentre of the New York Inferno.\r\n\r\nAmong the magistrates or police-court justices who figure conspicuously in\r\nthis hideous drama, one Justice Koch appears pre-eminent. I prefer not to\r\nattempt to express the sentiments which are aroused by the spectacle of\r\nsuch a Justice dispensing justice. Miss Rebecca Fream, a mission-worker\r\nwho had in vain endeavoured to secure some redress for the wrongs\r\ninflicted upon her poorer neighbours, was on one occasion ordered out of\r\nhis court. She told the Lexow Committee:--\r\n\r\n    I turned to him, and I said, “Don’t worry yourself; is this what you\r\n    call justice?” then I said, “May God pity the poor on the east side,\r\n    for with half-drunken judges on the bench whom shall they look to for\r\n    justice if God forsakes them; you were half-drunk yesterday when I\r\n    applied for a summons, and to-day you are so drunk you can’t see out\r\n    of your eyes.”\r\n\r\n    Q. He made no effort to punish you for contempt of court?\r\n\r\n    A. No; there was one of the officers, and he turned and said, “By jee,\r\n    I wouldn’t take that from anybody.” I said, “If you were in the same\r\n    boat with him you would have to take it.”\r\n\r\n    Chairman Lexow: Fine commentary upon the police-court procedure!\r\n\r\n    The Witness: That is nothing; that is only a drop in the bucket.--Vol.\r\n    iv., p. 4,484-5.\r\n\r\nThe police-court judge seems in many cases to have been the pivot on which\r\nthe whole horrible system of oppression revolved. It would need the pen of\r\na Zola to describe adequately these shambles of the poor. There was the\r\nheadquarters of the foul crew that flourished on perjury and grew fat upon\r\nusing the forms of the law to frustrate its aims. It was the paradise of\r\nthe professional bondsman, the blackmailer, and all the human vermin that\r\nthrive upon the misfortunes of their fellows. The worst lawbreakers of the\r\nprecinct stood inside the rail beside the judge, browbeat and bullied the\r\nunfortunate accused, and practised every kind of extortion with impunity.\r\nThe blackguard lawyer, hand-and-glove with the bandit policeman, found an\r\neven more detestable scoundrel than themselves upon the bench. The\r\nfiercest invectives of Juvenal would be too weak to do justice to these\r\nsinks of iniquity, in which honesty was a byword, innocence a\r\nlaughing-stock, and the law merely a convenient pretext for levying\r\nblackmail.\r\n\r\nThe Committee was constantly hearing of the abuses connected with these\r\ncourts, but the inquiry closed before they could be taken seriously in\r\nhand. The infamy of the system of bail, which was worked to fill the\r\npockets of the bondsmen, led to frequent comments. On one occasion the\r\nChairman remarked--\r\n\r\n    That seems to me to be a point that has never been properly\r\n    accentuated; the commission of the police justice and the general\r\n    activity of that character of man is a very great item going to show\r\n    their inefficiency. Blumenthal and Hochstein’s reputation was well\r\n    known, and their insolvency was an established fact, and yet they went\r\n    on bonds to the extent of thousands and thousands of dollars, and\r\n    those bonds were even forfeited and not paid, and the men accepted\r\n    again.--Vol. v., p. 4,490.\r\n\r\nIn the Report they say:--\r\n\r\n    While it was impossible for your Committee to spend much time in\r\n    considering police courts, enough is shown upon the record to justify\r\n    the conclusion that a very important reason why the police have been\r\n    able to carry on and successfully perpetrate their reprehensible\r\n    practices, is that at least some of the police justices have\r\n    apparently worked in sympathy and collusion with them.--Vol. i., p.\r\n    27.\r\n\r\nIn the examination of a witness named John Collins, Mr. Moss said--\r\n\r\n    I think that the evils perpetrated by these judges, some of them, are\r\n    even worse in their results than the evil practised by the police.\r\n\r\n    Chairman Lexow: It seems to me that any evil of that kind permitted by\r\n    a judge is ten times worse than that committed by any other\r\n    individual.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Moss: Of course, I myself have been before some of these judges\r\n    for the society which I represent, and know what it was to be sat down\r\n    upon, and outraged and browbeaten.\r\n\r\n    Senator Bradley: The witness says to me that the judges eat and drink\r\n    with these people, and know the character of the people well.--Vol.\r\n    v., p. 4,897.\r\n\r\nThe best way of bringing out this aspect of the administration of justice\r\nin New York is to set forth, without a word of comment, the substance of\r\nthe evidence taken concerning the abortionists.\r\n\r\nAbortion is not regarded in New York with anything approaching the horror\r\nthat is excited by the same crime in the Old World. According to the\r\nevidence given before the Lexow Committee by an expert there were about\r\ntwo hundred abortionists who advertised every day in New York their\r\nreadiness to kill the unborn child. It is an irregular profession that has\r\nregular practitioners. But, like all the other vices, it is a fertile\r\nsource of revenue to the police. Dr. Newton Whitehead, a leading\r\npractitioner in this recognised system of antenatal infanticide, was\r\ncalled before the Committee and testified as to the way in which he was at\r\nonce helped and hindered by the police. Whitehead was arrested three times\r\nin six weeks. He was never tried on any one of these occasions. But he had\r\nto pay in bribing the police and feeing the police lawyer the sum of £565.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was arrested by a policeman called Frink, who insisted that he\r\nshould retain for his defence a lawyer of the name of Friend. He was told\r\nthat Mr. Friend had got a telephone directly from his house to police\r\nheadquarters, so they informed him at once of all these cases, and he was\r\nour lawyer--the police lawyer (vol. iv., p. 4,240). Somewhat reluctantly,\r\nWhitehead sent for Friend. He had to pay him 700 dollars. Friend remarked\r\napologetically that he would not insist on so much; but “I don’t get this\r\nmoney myself: I have to turn over 50 per cent. of it to the police.” “Our\r\nlawyer,” indeed!\r\n\r\nThe policeman Frink then took his prisoner off into a small court-room,\r\nand told him, “In all these cases, Doctor, we expect to have some money\r\noff from them. Pay me 500 dollars and I will guarantee that the case will\r\nbe dismissed when it is called.” He paid 500 dollars and the case was\r\ndismissed, the only evidence offered incriminating, not the doctor, but a\r\nmidwife, whom, however, they refused to prosecute, as “she did not have\r\nany money, and was not worth bothering with.”\r\n\r\nThe lawyer, the doctor and the policeman dined together at a saloon in\r\nUniversity Place. During dinner the policeman grew confidential:--\r\n\r\n    Sergeant Frink remarked to me that that was a very nice place; he said\r\n    he knew the proprietor, and he said, “Doctor, this would be a very\r\n    nice place if you ever wanted to run a young girl in here, upstairs,\r\n    it would be all right; nothing would be said.”--Vol. iv., p. 4,235.\r\n\r\nA month later the doctor was again arrested. This time it cost him 475\r\ndollars, paid to the lawyer. He was again arrested in the following month,\r\nand was held for the Grand Jury:--\r\n\r\n    Q. There was a regular raid on the abortionists at that time, was\r\n    there not?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n    Q. And all the warrants were issued by Judge Koch?\r\n\r\n    A. All the warrants were issued by Judge Koch. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n    Q. Do you know that any have been convicted?\r\n\r\n    A. No, sir. It was simply a blackmailing scheme.\r\n\r\n    Q. Blackmailing by whom?\r\n\r\n    A. I expect by the police.\r\n\r\n    Q. Who issued the warrant you were arrested on?\r\n\r\n    A. Judge Koch.\r\n\r\n    Q. He seems to have had a monopoly on the issuing of warrants of these\r\n    cases?\r\n\r\n    A. He might have been making money pretty fast out of it.--Vol. iv.,\r\n    p. 4,246.\r\n\r\n“Judge Koch,” Whitehead said, “sat back in his chair, and he said he was\r\ngoing to make an example of me,” and he held me to wait the action to the\r\nGrand Jury. He first insisted on 7,500 dollars bail, but after various\r\ninterviews with the police lawyer and the police sergeant he reduced it to\r\n2,500 dollars.\r\n\r\nAbout a day or two after he had been held for the Grand Jury a lady came\r\nto see Whitehead, and said she wanted to be treated for abortion.\r\nWhitehead refused to treat her, and said that he had been so badly\r\nblackmailed:--\r\n\r\n    I told her I thought I would not practise any more; I would leave the\r\n    City of New York if they were going to prosecute me that way for\r\n    nothing, and she said, “The gentleman who got me in the family way is\r\n    a very influential man, and he is a judge, and can do a great deal for\r\n    you, doctor.” I told her I did not think he could, because I had been\r\n    held for the grand jury. She insisted, and said, “Doctor, who is this\r\n    man that held you?” I said, “It was Judge Koch;” she said, “Judge\r\n    Koch?” She said, “My God, he seduced me and got me in the family way\r\n    five times, and Judge Koch paid the bill.”\r\n\r\n    Mr. Goff: Proceed, doctor.\r\n\r\n    A. She left my house, and she went down to Judge Koch at Essex Market,\r\n    and Judge Koch sent for me.\r\n\r\n    Q. Sent for you?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir, by her. I have got lots of proof of that: there is no\r\n    need for him to wriggle out of it, for he cannot; and I went to see\r\n    Judge Koch, and he was as sweet as sugar. He told me, “Doctor,” he\r\n    says, “I am very sorry about this affair; I did not know that my girl\r\n    had ever been to you,” he said. “I will do all I can for\r\n    you--everything.” He said there would not anything come of this case.\r\n    “Don’t you be afraid;” the girl afterwards----\r\n\r\n    Q. Wait a while; was there any one present?\r\n\r\n    A. Mr. Friend here.\r\n\r\n    Q. Was present when Judge Koch said that to you?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n    Q. Just follow the narrative: how did Mr. Friend come to be there in\r\n    the room?\r\n\r\n    Judge Koch waited for him until he came; I sat there about\r\n    half-an-hour, and Koch seemed to be holding a case outside, and he\r\n    waited until Mr. Friend came; he came in and saw me, and said, “I am\r\n    waiting until Friend comes here.”\r\n\r\n    Q. Judge Koch said?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir; and when Friend came in he spoke this matter over, and\r\n    Friend wanted to know what it was; he said, “It was that Alexander\r\n    woman I had trouble with before.”--Vol. iv., p. 4,264.\r\n\r\nThe “Alexander woman” was an actress, apparently Koch’s mistress. Dr.\r\nWhitehead promised to perform the operation, but put it off. She went away\r\nto another doctor and had the abortion brought about.\r\n\r\n“I may say, Mr. Chairman,” said Mr. Goff, in addressing the Committee at\r\nthe close of Dr. Whitehead’s evidence, “that of all the terrible exposures\r\nthat have been testified to before this Committee, and that have shocked\r\nnot only our city but the civilised world, I think the most terrible of\r\nall is that which we have heard this afternoon. I think the Committee has\r\nreached the climax of the horrible in this city.”\r\n\r\n“Satan’s Invisible World Displayed,” indeed!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. WHITEHEAD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WALL STREET AND TRINITY CHURCH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE WORST TREASON OF ALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be remarked, somewhat impatiently I fear, by the reader of this\r\nlong and dismal series of stories of the way in which the municipal Thugs\r\ndid their deadly work, But where were the citizens? The good honest\r\ncitizens, we are told, are always in a majority. They proved that they\r\nwere able to elect their own City Government. Why did they not do it? What\r\nis the use of talking about “the land of liberty,” “the Great Republic,”\r\nand the Democratic principle, if the richest, oldest, and most\r\nhighly-educated city in the Western Continent is as impotent to use the\r\nballot-box to protect itself as if it were a city in the dominions of the\r\nGreat Mogul?\r\n\r\nThe answer of the Lexow Committee--not by any means a complete answer--is\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n    The results of the investigation up to this point may ... be properly\r\n    summarised in the general statement that it has been conclusively\r\n    shown that in a very large number of the election districts of New\r\n    York, almost every conceivable crime against the elective franchise\r\n    was either committed or permitted by the police, invariably in the\r\n    interest of the dominant Democratic organisation of the City of New\r\n    York, commonly called Tammany Hall. The crimes thus committed or\r\n    permitted by the police may be classified as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Arrest and brutal treatment of Republican voters, watchers, and\r\n    workers; open violations of the election laws; canvassing for Tammany\r\n    Hall candidates; invasion of election booths; forcing of Tammany Hall\r\n    pasters upon Republican voters; general intimidation of the voters by\r\n    the police directly and by Tammany Hall election district captains in\r\n    the presence and with the concurrence of the police; colonisation of\r\n    voters, illegal registration and repeating, aided and knowingly\r\n    permitted by the police; denial to Republican voters and election\r\n    district officers of their legal rights and privileges; co-operation\r\n    with and acquiescence in the usurpation by Tammany Hall election\r\n    district captains and watchers of alleged rights and privileges, in\r\n    violation of law.\r\n\r\n    In fact, it may be stated as characteristic of the conditions shown to\r\n    exist by a cloud of witnesses that the police conducted themselves at\r\n    the several polling places upon the principle that they were there,\r\n    not as guardians of the public peace to enforce law and order, but for\r\n    the purpose of acting as agents of Tammany Hall, in securing to the\r\n    candidates of that organisation by means fair or foul the largest\r\n    possible majorities. They evidently regarded themselves as coadjutors\r\n    of that organisation, stationed at the several polls for the purpose\r\n    of securing its success whether by lawful or unlawful means, resorting\r\n    to device, oppression, fraud, trickery, crime, and intimidation of\r\n    almost every conceivable character....--Vol. i., pp. 15, 16.\r\n\r\n    It is to be regretted that sufficient time was not at the disposal of\r\n    your Committee to enable it to subject every district in the city to a\r\n    rigorous examination upon the lines of this branch of inquiry, whereby\r\n    a more accurate estimate of the effect of police interference might be\r\n    reached. Sufficient, however, appears upon the record to show beyond\r\n    peradventure that, owing to the practices above referred to during the\r\n    years covered by the investigation, honest elections had no\r\n    existence, in fact, in the City of New York, and that, upon the\r\n    contrary, a huge conspiracy against the purity of the elective\r\n    franchise was connived at and participated in by the municipal police,\r\n    whereby the rights and privileges of the individual were trampled\r\n    ruthlessly under foot, and crime against the ballot held high\r\n    carnival.--Vol. i., p. 17.\r\n\r\nThe date of this Report, be it remembered, was January 15th, 1895. It may\r\nbe supplemented by a very significant admission made by Mr. Goff, himself\r\na Republican and now Recorder of New York. Speaking of the election frauds\r\nwhich he did so much to detect and punish in November, 1893:--\r\n\r\n    It would not be just to lay the blame exclusively upon the Tammany\r\n    inspectors, though, of course, being in the majority and in full\r\n    control, they were chargeable with all that took place. Republican\r\n    inspectors either openly co-operated with or quietly acquiesced in the\r\n    perpetration of the fraud.--_North American Review_, February, 1894,\r\n    p. 210.\r\n\r\nThe fraud on the ballot, to which both parties were privy, was all the\r\nmore abominable because the provisions of the law against such abuses were\r\nvery strict. But it is a favourite method in other countries than the\r\nUnited States to salve an uneasy conscience by passing a rigorous law\r\nwithout taking any precautions to see that it is carried into operation.\r\nThis mode of relieving the feelings had been indulged in by New Yorkers in\r\n1890, when the Ballot Reform Act passed into law. But, writing in 1894,\r\nMr. Goff, who was Counsel to the Committee for the Prosecution of Election\r\nFrauds, said:--\r\n\r\n    Since the enactment of the reform-ballot law in 1890 no organised\r\n    effort has been made to watch its operation or to detect any illegal\r\n    practices. The public was satisfied with the popular catch-name of the\r\n    Act, and it slept peacefully upon the assurance that fraud was no\r\n    longer possible; but the evidence obtained by the volunteer watchers,\r\n    and the finding of over sixty indictments by the Grand Jury, mainly\r\n    against election officials, demonstrate that false registration, false\r\n    voting, and bribery are as easily and as safely practised as they ever\r\n    were, and that perjury has enormously increased, owing to the number\r\n    of safeguards which must be sworn away by the fraudulent voter and the\r\n    collusive inspector.--_Ib._, p. 204.\r\n\r\nThere were 1,157 polling stations in New York in 1893, and it was not\r\npossible to obtain competent watchers for all of them. But the evidence\r\nobtained was sufficient to show on how colossal a scale the frauds were\r\npractised, with the co-operation or connivance of both parties.\r\nBallot-stuffing seems to have been common. Mr. Goff says:--\r\n\r\n    Almost without exception there were more ballots found in the\r\n    ballot-box than the ballot clerk’s number showed to have been\r\n    delivered or the poll-list showed to have been voted, and in a great\r\n    number of districts more than the registration. How they came there is\r\n    to some extent a mystery: but in some places ballots were folded in\r\n    duplicate, and in others the pile of ballots on the table was added to\r\n    by a sleight-of-hand performance.--_Ib._, p. 209.\r\n\r\nIn the Thirty-sixth Election District of the Second Assembly District it\r\nwas estimated that 5,000 out of the 12,770 votes counted were fraudulent.\r\nIn the Seventh of the Third 567 ballots were found in the box for a\r\ndistrict which had only 508 names on the register. Repeating and\r\npersonation were almost universal. The lodging-houses played a leading\r\npart in the squalid and sordid drama. The tramps who use these dossing\r\nkens are all registered. But as they seldom pass three nights in the same\r\nplace, they rarely vote where they are registered. That, however, is a\r\nmere detail. Mr. Goff says:--\r\n\r\n    The same men who registered did not, as a rule, vote upon the names\r\n    given. To have them do so would require their maintenance at the\r\n    lodging-house, and that would be too expensive. A more economic plan\r\n    was adopted. A few days previous to election the proprietors of the\r\n    lodging-houses were furnished, by the election-district captains, with\r\n    lists of the names registered from their houses. Separate slips for\r\n    each name were then supplied, and on election day the tramps, as they\r\n    come along, were handed the slips, and they voted on the names thus\r\n    given as frequently as they could get the slips. The election workers\r\n    were never hard pushed to bring out the registered vote. They simply\r\n    sent for the men when they wanted them, and were always supplied with\r\n    the required number. Sometimes the floater forgot the name given to\r\n    him or could not read the slip; sometimes a man who could not speak\r\n    English wrestled with an American name, or an English-speaking man\r\n    struggled with a Polish name. In all of these cases the obliging\r\n    inspectors helped them out either by looking at the slip or by giving\r\n    some sort of pronunciation to the unpronounceable name. In some\r\n    election districts there was a rivalry as to who could vote on the\r\n    most names, and the man who won the honours was an ex-convict, who\r\n    voted eighteen times in two election districts of the Third Assembly\r\n    District.--_Ib._, p. 205.\r\n\r\nThe evidence taken before the Lexow Committee abounds with vivid little\r\nvignettes of how elections were conducted in New York City only four years\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nHere, for instance, is what Mr. Louis Meyer, a Republican inspector in the\r\nThird Assembly District, heard given as official directions by Police\r\nCaptain Devery to a platoon of policemen on the morning of the November\r\npoll, 1893. The Union League and the City Club had decided to send\r\nwatchers to the polls to detect any illegal practices. So by way of\r\npreparing for their reception, Captain Devery told the police in Mr.\r\nMeyer’s hearing:--\r\n\r\n    There is a lot of silk-stocking people coming from up town to bulldose\r\n    you people, and if they open their mouths, stand them on their\r\n    heads.--Vol. i., p. 203, Lexow Report.\r\n\r\nWith such instructions it is not surprising that the police refused to\r\ninterfere when their attention was called to the most flagrant breach of\r\nthe law. Here is the story of Israel Ellis, Republican poll clerk at the\r\nFifth Election District of the Third Assembly:--\r\n\r\n    When several voters came and they were handed sets of ballots, I\r\n    wanted to get their names down, but the chairman and the officer told\r\n    me it would be sufficient for me to take down the name and the vote.\r\n\r\n    I told them it was not sufficient, because if I did not do this, there\r\n    would be a great deal of repeating done; and they said, “Never mind,\r\n    it is none of your business; you do as we tell you; it has been\r\n    carried on for a great length of time,” and I still kept on\r\n    protesting. And once the chairman of inspectors and another inspector\r\n    said if I didn’t shut up they would remove me from the board, and then\r\n    the officer said if I would not stop he would take a hand in that too.\r\n\r\n    Q. The policeman said that to you?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir; and then several times the repeaters came in openly,\r\n    without any fear whatever, and they tried to vote, and each time I\r\n    protested and challenged their votes; and one time a repeater came in\r\n    and he passed the ballot clerk, he passed the chairman, but I\r\n    recognised him as a repeater, and I challenged the man, and I said,\r\n    “What is your name?” but the man had forgotten his name, because he\r\n    was voting for the second--third--time, and so I caught hold of that\r\n    man by the collar and ejected him, and the officer did not say one\r\n    word; a second time a man came in to vote which I myself recognised as\r\n    voting the second time in that election district; and another witness\r\n    told me, whose name I do not know, that he was voting for the third\r\n    time, and I waited until the man had voted, and I challenged his vote,\r\n    and the man voted, and after he voted I caught hold of that man, and\r\n    said, “Officer, I want you to arrest that man;” and the officer looked\r\n    at the ceiling, not at me; he did not say a thing, and he did not\r\n    arrest the man.\r\n\r\n    Q. Did you tell the officer what you wanted him to arrest him for?\r\n\r\n    A. I told him, the officer, that he voted for the second time to my\r\n    own knowledge, and the third time to the knowledge of a witness, and\r\n    wanted him to arrest him.\r\n\r\n    Q. And he looked at the ceiling?\r\n\r\n    A. He looked at the ceiling.--_Ib._, vol. i., pp. 216-17.\r\n\r\nOne voter was allowed to vote on the Christian name John. He could not\r\nremember the other name. At the close seventy-two more votes were found in\r\nthe ballot-box than there had been voters in the booth.\r\n\r\nA similar scene was described as occurring at the Third Election District\r\nby Jacob Subin, a Republican watcher, who deposed that he had seen Mr.\r\nRosalsky, the captain of the Socialistic Labour Party, protest against a\r\nyoung man who actually attempted to vote in Mr. Rosalsky’s name under his\r\nvery nose. Mr. Rosalsky grabbed hold of him and demanded that he should be\r\nlocked up as a repeater caught in the act. Three Tammany heelers thereupon\r\npunched Mr. Rosalsky’s face for him. He called upon the policeman to\r\nprotect him. That worthy stretched himself leisurely and replied, “Well, I\r\nguess I am pretty busy just now. I will see you after four o’clock, and\r\nwill have more time to spend.” The heelers then were for mauling Rosalsky\r\nmore severely; but the Tammany captain interfered, and, as an act of\r\ngrace, secured his release on condition that he went right away. Rosalsky\r\nbolted for his life. After this Jacob Subin deemed it wiser to content\r\nhimself with a simple protest when he saw such repeating as this:--\r\n\r\n    I have seen the Tammany Hall heelers bring in five or six men, drill\r\n    them into line, and from the appearance of some of them they looked\r\n    like Irishmen, and some like recent importations from Chatham Square\r\n    or any of those dives, and most of those voted on Hebrew names; but\r\n    the fun of it was that they could not pronounce the name under any\r\n    circumstances that they were voting, and of course, as a rule, the\r\n    chairman of the board of inspectors used to correct them, and in some\r\n    instances they forgot their names entirely, and in such cases they\r\n    went out of the line, and then the heelers would approach them and\r\n    bestow such vile language upon them, and curse them and swear at them\r\n    for being so stupid as not to recollect the name of the person they\r\n    were voting under; and then they would drill them into line again, and\r\n    I protested against them. I attempted to challenge them, and I was\r\n    told unless I stopped monkeying with the regular way of doing business\r\n    that I would be thrown through the window.--Vol. i., p. 303.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE MONSTER HOTELS OF NEW YORK: HOTEL MAJESTIC.]\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the Tammany captain as master of the revels thus\r\nreported by Jacob Subin is significant. Frank Nichols, in the\r\nTwenty-ninth Election District of the Third Assembly, where they had\r\neighty-four more votes than they had names on the register, took two\r\nvoters to the poll. As he was on the wrong side his men were not allowed\r\nto vote:--\r\n\r\n    I said, “Why can’t they vote?” and they said, “No, they could not\r\n    vote,” and I said, “What was the matter of these people they could not\r\n    vote?” and they said, “You go home; go home; you people can’t vote any\r\n    more,” and then I was put out in the middle of the street, and the\r\n    captain of the election district said, “Take this fellow away from\r\n    here,” and a fellow hit me in the eye with a brass knuckle.\r\n\r\n    Q. Did the police do anything at all?\r\n\r\n    A. No, sir; he would not arrest a cat that day as long as it belonged\r\n    to Tammany Hall; he would not arrest a cat.--Vol. i., p. 301.\r\n\r\nCanute A. Deas, who was Inspector of Election at the First Election\r\nDistrict of the Third Assembly, protested fifty times in a single day\r\nagainst barefaced repeating. The policeman whispered in his ear that he\r\nmeant to be fair, but he had his directions to take his orders from the\r\nChairman of the Board. Captain Devery drove up and stood laughing and\r\ntalking with the Tammany captain while the legal voters were in vain\r\nclamouring to be allowed to vote. The Republican watcher was thrown out by\r\nforce under the eyes of the policeman:--\r\n\r\n    Q. Who threw him out?\r\n\r\n    A. The crowd--the Tammany Hall captain of the district, who was in\r\n    there; he was authority for everything.--_Ib._, vol. i., p. 279.\r\n\r\n    Examined by Chairman Lexow: When you said that the Tammany Hall\r\n    captain was authority for everything, what did you mean?\r\n\r\n    A. I meant that, whenever he desired to go into the polling place, he\r\n    did so, that whatever he wanted was done; it seemed that they all\r\n    worshipped him, bowed down to him.--_Ib._, vol. i., p. 287.\r\n\r\nAnother witness, Ralph Nathan, described how a Republican captain was\r\nhustled out because he swore that a voter had already voted in four\r\nelection districts, for he had followed him round and had seen him do it.\r\nMr. Nathan said:--\r\n\r\n    The Tammany henchmen around the Third Assembly district have a\r\n    peculiar method of putting a man out; you cannot make a particular\r\n    charge of assault against them, hardly, but they push them out and\r\n    hustle them out; they have probably ten heelers at every election\r\n    district, and the polling place is generally narrow and small, and\r\n    they can fill up a place and push you out.--Vol. i., p. 290.\r\n\r\nHere also is a description of the method in which repeaters were brought\r\nup when wanted. Mr. C. H. P. Collis, a prominent citizen who acted as\r\nwatcher for the Twenty-second Election District of the Second Assembly\r\nDistrict, deposed that he saw repeating going on openly:--\r\n\r\n    Q. Men voted under names that were not theirs?\r\n\r\n    A. I cannot go so far as that.\r\n\r\n    Q. Describe what you did see?\r\n\r\n    A. I saw a man who sat at my side ticking off the list, and those\r\n    names that were not ticked he would take three or four of them, men\r\n    who had not voted, and hand them to an active worker, I supposed for\r\n    the purpose of having those people hunted up and brought to the\r\n    polls, which would be legitimate; but I saw this man take them out in\r\n    the street and hand them to the people there.\r\n\r\n    Q. Hand those names to the people?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n    Q. Then what occurred?\r\n\r\n    A. Then after awhile a man would come in and walk up to the polls.\r\n\r\n    Q. And would he call off one of those names?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir. In fact one man had forgotten his name and turned to the\r\n    man who brought him in, and said, “What is that?”--and he told him,\r\n    “John Kelly,” or whatever the name was.--Vol. i., p. 130-1.\r\n\r\nAs a pendant to this scene take the following description of what happened\r\nat a previous election, where Mr. Thomas F. Harrington, Republican\r\nwatcher, who had been challenging repeaters, was set upon by one Whitty,\r\nan ex-convict, as he was returning to the polling place to attend to his\r\nduties. Whitty was carrying a club and a revolver. Harrington argued with\r\nhim, fearing that “they meant to inflict punishment upon me,” and\r\nremonstrated against causing blood to be spilled on election day. Whitty,\r\nhowever, held on to his man, whereupon, said Harrington:--\r\n\r\n    I grabbed him by the throat with my left hand and went to strike him\r\n    with my right, when the two officers (who had been standing watching\r\n    Whitty’s attack) rushed. One officer grabbed me by the coat and raised\r\n    his club to strike me, and I told him if he struck me I would kill him\r\n    where he stood, and a friend of mine came forward to help me, and the\r\n    other officer rushed out and grabbed him, and up with his stick to\r\n    strike him; they did not take hold of this Whitty at all; it was me\r\n    and my friend they took hold of.\r\n\r\n    Q. And these policemen made no move to protect you in any wise in this\r\n    assault, until you began to defend yourself?\r\n\r\n    A. No, sir.\r\n\r\n    Q. And then they laid hold of you and of your friend?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir.--Vol. i., p. 135.\r\n\r\n“We are in the business of carrying elections,” said Boss Tweed, and a\r\nvery successful business Tammany has made of it.\r\n\r\nBut what becomes of popular sovereignty, of the majesty of the ballot, of\r\nthe sacred privileges of citizenship?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. VAN WYCK. First Mayor of Greater New York.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From the _Journal_, New York.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nHAMSTRUNG CÆSARISM AS A REMEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nDESPAIRING DEMOCRACY.\r\n\r\n\r\nDespair is a strong word, nor can the citizens be rightly said to despair\r\nof the Republic while they are still engaged in making energetic efforts\r\nfor its salvation. In the strict sense of the word, therefore, it is\r\nabsurd to speak of a despairing democracy, which is still struggling to\r\navert its threatened doom. But for democracy in the English sense of the\r\nword there is no longer any struggle in the City of New York. The ablest\r\nand the most hopeful Americans have given it up as a bad job, so far at\r\nleast as city government is concerned. Hence, it is no misnomer to speak\r\nof Despairing Democracy as the natural and, perhaps, inevitable\r\nconsequence of the display of “Satan’s Invisible World,” a few hints and\r\nglimpses of which have been afforded in the preceding chapters.\r\n\r\nIt seems but the other day that Mr. Andrew Carnegie flaunted before the\r\neyes of his former countrymen the magnificent achievements of the\r\nprinciple which in city government is already abandoned in despair. Who\r\ncould have imagined when reading the exultant pæan chanted by this\r\nAmerican Scot over the achievements of “Triumphant Democracy” in the\r\nWestern Republic, that within a very few years we should be called upon to\r\nchant a dirge over its grave in the first city in the United States.\r\n\r\nSuch an assertion will, no doubt, startle many readers both in the Old\r\nWorld and the New. It will be vehemently contested, chiefly by those who\r\nare too deeply immersed in the roaring eddies of the fight to be able to\r\nappreciate the significance of the drift of the current which is sweeping\r\nthem free from their ancient moorings. But outsiders proverbially see most\r\nof the game. It is in no spirit of exultation, but rather with a feeling\r\nof profound regret, that I note the course which the law of evolution\r\nseems to be taking in the great cities of the Western World. That regret\r\nis chastened and subdued by two considerations. The first is based upon\r\nthe belief in the providential government of the universe. The second,\r\nwhich is more personal to myself, is the fact that for nearly twenty years\r\nI have been engaged in an attempt to compel hidebound devotees of\r\nparliamentary government to admit the virtue that is latent in the Russian\r\nautocracy. I am no bigot of Constitutionalism, neither am I guilty of the\r\narrogant folly of pronouncing judgment upon expedients the adoption of\r\nwhich the ablest and wisest men in other lands deem to be indispensable.\r\nBut the most sympathetic observer, after he has made all allowances,\r\ncannot ignore the salient fact of the situation, which is that by\r\nuniversal consent of the ablest and most practical citizens in the\r\nforemost city of America, democracy, in the ordinary sense of the term,\r\nhas hopelessly and irretrievably broken down.\r\n\r\nBe it carefully observed that I limit the collapse of democracy to that\r\napplication of the principle which has hitherto been regarded as natural\r\nand almost invariable. Democratic government, as defined by Abraham\r\nLincoln, “government of the people, for the people, and by the people,”\r\nhas in English-speaking lands, and nowhere more so than in New England,\r\nbeen regarded as the government of the community by an elective\r\nassembly--that is to say, representatives chosen by the different\r\nlocalities meet together in a common council which is entrusted with\r\nauthority to manage the affairs of the community. The House of Commons is\r\nthe most familiar type of such a democratic assembly, but every town\r\ncouncil in the land is based on the same principle. Nor is it only in\r\nBritain that this principle has been applied. It has hitherto prevailed\r\nwherever democracy has been adopted as the system of government; whether\r\nin the French Republic, in the German Municipalities, or in any and all of\r\nour Colonies, the same principle invariably reappears. The centre of\r\nauthority is the elective assembly, composed of representatives of the\r\nwards or districts or constituencies into which the city or community or\r\nnation has been divided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A VIEW IN BROADWAY.]\r\n\r\nOf course, I shall be told, and justly told, that this system of what may\r\nbe called parliamentary or municipal democracy is by no means the only\r\nform through which democracy can give effect to its will. This, of course,\r\nis perfectly true, and that was why I was so careful to limit and define\r\nwhat I meant by democracy. There is no danger of my forgetting that\r\ndemocracy can exist without the usual parliamentary or municipal\r\napparatus. Russia, although governed autocratically, is nevertheless one\r\nof the purest democracies in the world. Neither can any Englishman who\r\nlived through the Second Empire in France forget that the Third Napoleon\r\nalways maintained that the Empire was the true and natural outcome of\r\nmodern democracy. Nevertheless, although the Tsar of Russia rules over a\r\ndemocratic nation, and the Third Napoleon regarded himself as the armed\r\nguardian of French democracy, the conventional conception of a democracy\r\nin English-speaking lands has never been that of a community governed by\r\nan autocrat, but always of a community in which the centre of power lay in\r\nthe elective assembly. It is this conventional theory of democracy which\r\nhas been thrown overboard in New York. Hence, from the point of view of\r\nthe parliamentarian or the conventional believer in government by an\r\nassembly of elected persons, the Charter of Greater New York, under which\r\nthe first election has just taken place, is a more melancholy spectacle\r\nthan even “Satan’s Invisible World Displayed,” with all its saturnalia of\r\ndebauchery, violence and corruption. The Charter of Greater New York is\r\nthe direct outcome, the natural fruit of the bitter experience of Tammany\r\nrule. Once more, to quote the familiar saying, “Sin when it hath conceived\r\nbringeth forth death,” and the sin revealed by the Lexow Committee has\r\nbrought forth a deadly harvest in the Charter of Greater New York. Deadly,\r\nthat is, inasmuch as it is fatal to the principle of vesting the\r\ngovernment of the people in the elected representatives of the people in\r\npublic council assembled. For the central principle of the Charter of\r\nGreater New York is the substitution of the authority of a Tsar-Mayor for\r\nwhat has hitherto been regarded as the natural authority of an elected\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\nThis is not a sudden and unexpected change. The evolution of an elective\r\nautocracy has been in progress for some years, but it has never before\r\nbeen brought into such conspicuous prominence as by the Charter of Greater\r\nNew York, for that Charter is the formal embodiment in black and white of\r\nthe central principle of the Second Empire, with certain modifications\r\nwhich accentuate rather than diminish the expression of democratic\r\ndespair, of which it is the embodiment. It is this evolution of\r\nBonapartism, of an elective dictatorship, based on universal suffrage,\r\nwhich is the most startling phenomenon of modern politics in the United\r\nStates. The Third Napoleon never claimed to reign by divine right. His\r\nauthority was based upon a mass-vote of the electors of France. His\r\nthrone, although propped by bayonets, was seated on universal suffrage,\r\nand in theory he asserted, and in practice in the last years of his reign\r\nadopted, the principle that this autocracy, which originally sprang from a\r\nmass-vote of the people, needed to be renewed and confirmed from time to\r\ntime by a _plébiscite_ of the whole nation.\r\n\r\nThe government of Greater New York, as it has been established by the\r\nCharter under which the recent election took place, is simply the Second\r\nEmpire of France re-established in the first city of the American\r\nRepublic, with the limitation that the reign of the despot shall be\r\nrigidly limited to four years, after which he shall not be eligible for\r\nre-election until the expiry of another term of an equal duration. That\r\nthis in no sense is an exaggeration, but a simple literal statement of\r\nfacts perfectly well known in the United States, I shall shortly proceed\r\nto show; but before doing so it is well to note some of the circumstances\r\nwhich led up to this extraordinary evolution of autocracy on Republican\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CANDIDATE VAN WYCK IS SAID TO HAVE POLLED THE SOLID VOTE OF\r\nTHE CYCLISTS OF GREATER NEW YORK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. SETH LOW. First Tsar-Mayor of Brooklyn.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE TSAR-MAYOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parallel which instinctively occurs to the mind of the observer is one\r\nof somewhat evil omen for the future of the American Commonwealth. The\r\nRoman Republic evolved the Empire very much in the same way that the Tsar\r\nMayoralty of Greater New York has been evolved from the institutions which\r\npreceded it. The Roman Empire was not based upon a _plébiscite_ of the\r\ncitizens, but equally with the New York Mayoralty it ignored the principle\r\nof hereditary right. Occasionally the Imperial purple passed from father\r\nto son, but for the most part the throne was filled by the only kind of\r\nelection possible in those days. The Emperor was the choice of men who\r\nwielded, not ballots, but swords.\r\n\r\nA study of the corruption and despair which produced the Roman Empire will\r\nsupply many curious parallels to the existing state of things in America.\r\nIn ancient Italy, as in modern New York, elective institutions had been\r\nabused until the best citizens despaired of the Republic. The Third\r\nNapoleon, in his history of Julius Cæsar, writes concerning the way in\r\nwhich elections were managed in ancient Rome in terms which curiously\r\nresemble those employed by the Lexow Committee in explaining how elections\r\nwere worked in modern New York:--\r\n\r\n    The sale of consciences had so planted itself in public morals, that\r\n    the several instruments of electoral corruption had functions and\r\n    titles almost recognised. Those who bought votes were called\r\n    _divisores_; the go-betweens were _interpretes_; and those with whom\r\n    was deposited the purchase-money were _sequestres_. Numerous secret\r\n    societies were formed for making a trade of the right of suffrage;\r\n    they were divided into decuries, the several heads of which obeyed a\r\n    supreme head, who treated with the candidates and sold the votes of\r\n    the associates, either for money, or on the stipulation of certain\r\n    advantages for himself or his friends. These societies carried most of\r\n    the elections, and Cicero himself, who so often boasted of the\r\n    unanimity with which he had been chosen Consul, owed to them a great\r\n    part of the suffrages he obtained....\r\n\r\n    This all was struck with decadence. Brute force bestowed power, and\r\n    corruption the magistracies. Numerous elements of dissolution\r\n    afflicted society; the venality of the judges, the traffic in\r\n    elections, the absolutism of the Senate, the tyranny of wealth, which\r\n    oppressed the poor by usury, and braved the law with\r\n    impunity.--“Julius Cæsar,” by Napoleon III., vol. i., p. 3.\r\n\r\nAs a way of escape from the disasters which afflicted the Republic, there\r\nemerged in natural process of evolution, first, the dictatorship of Sylla,\r\nthen the triumph of Marius, afterwards the ascendency of Cæsar, which led\r\ndirectly to the foundation of the Empire by Augustus. We are not within\r\nsight of the Augustan Empire in the United States, but the same causes\r\nwhich in the natural course of time ripened the Empire of the Cæsars are\r\nto be seen in full operation on the banks of the Hudson. The United States\r\nis happily at present without the legionaries whose supremacy enabled a\r\nsuccession of military commanders to establish the Roman Empire upon the\r\ngrave of the Roman Republic. That element of danger may not be wanting in\r\ntime to come. The growth of imperial ambitions at Washington is one of the\r\nmost plainly marked signs of the times. A spirit which to-day annexes\r\nHawaii, threatens Spain, and defies Europe with the Monroe Doctrine, will\r\ncertainly be driven to increase its armaments or to abate its ambitions.\r\nThese things, however, belong to the next century. Sufficient unto the day\r\nis the evil thereof.\r\n\r\nThe system of the Tsar-Mayor first came into operation at Brooklyn in\r\n1882. It sprang, as did the Second Empire, from the timidity of the\r\ncitizens. Mr. Seth Low, the first Tsar-Mayor, writing in the last edition\r\nof Bryce’s “American Commonwealth,” points out this very clearly. He\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n    The aim of the Americans for many years deliberately was to make a\r\n    city government where no officer by himself could have power enough to\r\n    do much harm. The natural result of this was to create a situation\r\n    where no officer had power to do good.\r\n\r\nThe idea of allowing citizens in their wards to elect representatives, who\r\nshould wield all the powers vested in English, French or German town\r\ncouncils, was regarded by Americans as savouring of suicidal recklessness.\r\nTo trust the elected representatives of the people in an American city, as\r\nwe trust the town councils of Birmingham and Glasgow, seems rash and\r\nreckless to the American statesman. A very thoughtful writer in the\r\n_Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science_ four\r\nyears ago, singled out the English municipal system as one which no sane\r\nAmerican would dream of applying to a great American city. He said:--\r\n\r\n    It may be safely said that this whole organisation of the Birmingham\r\n    government is an exaggeration of the features which have had the worst\r\n    effects in the United States. It must make the mouth of a Tammany\r\n    chief water to think of such a simplification of his labours and\r\n    increase of the opportunities for plunder.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this, American observers have followed Mr. Chamberlain in\r\ndeclaring that Birmingham is the best governed city of the world. That,\r\nhowever, in no way reassures the American pessimist, who has put on record\r\nhis conviction that “the vicious principles evolved in English municipal\r\ngovernment will overcome any safeguard, and that it is only a question of\r\ntime when English cities have a taste of what New York has been through.”\r\nThe result of this deep-rooted conviction in the American mind, that the\r\nelect of the people is certain to steal if he gets a chance, was that\r\ncity governments came into existence dominated by the one desire to\r\nparalyse in advance the city council, to limit its opportunities of\r\nstealing, and place it more or less at the mercy of the State\r\nLegislatures. The result of this system born of cowardice and lack of\r\nfaith was to transfer almost all power in New York from the city\r\nauthorities to Tammany Hall. Tammany, in theory at least, was broad based\r\nupon the people’s will, nor was there any limitation to the authority of\r\nthe Boss.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the absurdity of this system, and the ruinous results which\r\nfollowed, forced upon the minds of the more intelligent citizens the fact\r\nthat something must be done, and that at any cost. Some centre of local\r\nauthority must be created which could be trusted not to steal. Mr. Seth\r\nLow explains and defends the establishment of the Tsar-Mayor on the theory\r\nthat cities in their organic capacity are more accurately described as\r\nlarge corporations than as small states. He says:--\r\n\r\n    The better results flowing from this theory are easily made clear.\r\n    Americans are sufficiently adept in the administration of large\r\n    business enterprises to understand that, in any such undertaking, some\r\n    one man must be given the power of direction and the choice of his\r\n    chief assistants; they understand that power and responsibility must\r\n    go together from the top to the bottom of every successful business\r\n    organisation. Consequently, when it began to be realised that a city\r\n    was a business corporation rather than an integral part of the State,\r\n    the unwillingness to organise the city upon the line of concentrated\r\n    power in connection with concentrated responsibility began to\r\n    disappear. The charter of the city of Brooklyn is probably as advanced\r\n    a type as can be found of the results of this mode of thinking. In\r\n    Brooklyn the executive side of the city government is represented by\r\n    the mayor and the various heads of departments. The legislative side\r\n    consists of a common council of nineteen members, twelve of whom are\r\n    elected from three districts, each having four aldermen, the remaining\r\n    seven being elected, as aldermen at large by the whole city. The\r\n    people elect three city officers, besides the board of aldermen--the\r\n    mayor, who is the real as well as the nominal head of the city, the\r\n    comptroller, who is practically the book-keeper of the city, and the\r\n    auditor, whose audit is necessary for the payment of every bill\r\n    against the city, whether large or small. The mayor appoints\r\n    absolutely, without confirmation by the common council, all the\r\n    executive heads of departments. He appoints, for example, the police\r\n    commissioner, the commissioner of city works, the corporation counsel\r\n    or counsellor at law, the city treasurer, the tax collector, and, in\r\n    general, all the officials who are charged with executive duties.\r\n    These officials, in turn, appoint their own subordinates, so that the\r\n    principle of defined responsibility permeates the city government from\r\n    top to bottom. The mayor also appoints the board of assessors, the\r\n    board of education, and the board of elections. The executive officers\r\n    appointed by the mayor are appointed for a term of two years--that is\r\n    to say, for a term similar to his own.--Bryce’s “American\r\n    Commonwealth,” vol. i.\r\n\r\nThis Charter first came into effect in January, 1882, and Brooklyn has\r\nbeen governed by Tsar-Mayors ever since. Mr. Seth Low, who was the first\r\nTsar-Mayor in America, and who subsequently served a second time, claims\r\nfor it the virtues and vices of all despotisms. When you have a good Tsar,\r\nnothing can be better. When you have a bad Tsar, nothing can be worse. As\r\nhe says, the Brooklyn system “made clear to the simplest citizen that the\r\nentire character of the city government depends upon the man chosen for\r\nthe office of Mayor.” It is, of course, playing double or quits. If you\r\nget a good man, his immense power enables him to be potent for good, but\r\nif you get a bad one, Heaven help the city!\r\n\r\nThe Brooklyn system was adopted with modification in several towns,\r\nnotably in Cleveland, in Cincinnati, and to a certain extent in\r\nPhiladelphia. The same system was carried out to its ultimate extreme in\r\nthe Charter of the City of Quincy, in Massachusetts. Mr. Gamaliel\r\nBradford, of Boston, in the May number of the _Annals of the American\r\nAcademy of Political and Social Science_ for 1893, thus explained the\r\nevolution of the Tsar-Mayor as it could be seen in the Quincy Charter:--\r\n\r\n    It was provided that the mayor should be the only executive official\r\n    elected at all, and he by general vote of the city, so that he might\r\n    be the embodiment of the whole administration and responsible for it.\r\n    That he might be this, he was given the full power of appointment and\r\n    removal of all subordinates except the school committee, as to whom\r\n    even the radical framers of the charter shrank from encountering the\r\n    popular prejudice. It was held that the separate election of\r\n    officials, whether by popular vote or that of the council, is\r\n    destructive of all subordination, of all firm or efficient\r\n    administration, and of all personal responsibility. But the Quincy\r\n    charter ran counter to another prejudice much more deeply rooted: the\r\n    requirement of confirmation of the mayor’s appointments by the council\r\n    or aldermen.\r\n\r\n    The New York charter of 1884 gave to the mayor the full power of\r\n    appointment, though that of removal, which seems to be necessary to\r\n    make the other effective, was still jealously withheld. The Quincy\r\n    charter gives both powers in full measure. Another object aimed at,\r\n    though with some compromises, was to get rid of boards or commissions,\r\n    as overriding the mayor and destroying that personal responsibility\r\n    which was regarded as so important to public opinion. One man in every\r\n    place, that man directly responsible to the mayor alone, and the mayor\r\n    himself to the people, at short intervals; this was the guiding\r\n    theory. To obviate the almost morbid dread of one man power, it was\r\n    provided that the mayor might be removed from office by a\r\n    three-fourths vote of the council, and a new election ordered. The\r\n    theory was developed by another provision wholly new in the practice\r\n    of the country: that the heads of departments, as well as the mayor,\r\n    should be required to be present at the sessions of the council, to\r\n    explain the wants of administration, and to give a public account of\r\n    their stewardship in response to the questions of individual members.\r\n    It was expected that in this way the strength or weakness of the mayor\r\n    would be made clear to the popular apprehension, and that a better and\r\n    improving class of men would be chosen with a corresponding effect\r\n    upon city affairs.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Mr. Bradford was compelled to admit, what Mr. Charles\r\nFrancis Adams had previously pointed out, that the experiment of the\r\nTsar-Mayor was, in Quincy, by no means justified by its results. Mr.\r\nBradford says:--\r\n\r\n    It must be admitted, upon the evidence of leading citizens of Quincy,\r\n    that the charter has thus far failed to accomplish its purpose; that\r\n    extravagance of expenditure, local jobbing and caucus politics are as\r\n    rampant as in other cities in the State.\r\n\r\nNevertheless and notwithstanding the disappointment in Quincy, when the\r\nCharter of Greater New York came to be discussed, the advocates of what\r\nmay be called the English or normal system of vesting the government of\r\nthe town in the hands of an elective council were in a hopeless minority,\r\nand the Charter of New York was drawn up upon the Tsar-Mayor basis. The\r\nadvocates of the Tsar-Mayor used all the familiar arguments which are\r\nemployed by apologists for autocracy all over the world. Their great\r\nkeynote was the need for the concentration of responsibility.\r\n\r\n“It is necessary,” said Mr. Godkin, “to reduce to its lowest possible\r\npoint the number of executive officers whom the community has to watch.”\r\nMr. De Witt, Chairman of the Committee, who drafted the Charter for\r\nGreater New York, put the matter succinctly when he wrote:--“I am for a\r\nTsar-Mayor, with a short term, and a free right to go again to the\r\npeople”; and then he added, recurring to the curious vein of fatalism\r\nwhich in Napoleon found expression in a belief in his destiny, “I believe\r\nthat the Supreme Ruler of the universe moves through the mind of the\r\nmultitude, and in this age of free schools and ubiquitous journalism, no\r\nmayor with plenary power and full responsibility would dare to permit\r\ncorruption or inefficiency to exist in any department. If he did, the\r\npeople would have only one head to hit, and one party to demolish.”\r\n\r\nThis change, to which we may take it American reformers are now definitely\r\ncommitted, may be, as Mr. E. M. Shephard declared, “the most important\r\ngain in municipal reform in our time,” or it may be the first step down\r\nthe inclined plane which leads to despotism. My duty is not to dogmatise,\r\nbut merely to describe. All that I would venture to observe by way of\r\ncomment is that the new reform seems to be at variance, not only with the\r\nuniversally accepted English idea, which may, of course, be ignored, but\r\nequally with the Jeffersonian theory of the fundamental principle of Local\r\nGovernment. It may be necessary to fight fire with fire, and to cast out\r\nthe Boss by the Tsar-Mayor, but old-fashioned Liberals may be pardoned if\r\nthey feel that it is a very dangerous game to cast out the Devil by the\r\naid of Beelzebub, the Prince of Devils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. ALBERT SHAW. Editor of the _Review of Reviews_, New\r\nYork.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE CHARTER OF GREATER NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Charter of Greater New York is the last, or rather the latest, of a\r\nlong series of Charters granted by the State Legislature of New York for\r\nthe government of the city. There were eleven distinct Charters granted\r\nbetween 1846 and 1890, so that the average life of a Charter is only four\r\nyears. The Charter preceding this was regarded by Mr. Godkin as the best\r\nbecause it reduced the elective element almost to vanishing point:--\r\n\r\n    No community as heterogeneous as ours can manage its affairs\r\n    successfully through democratic forms without reducing to its lowest\r\n    possible point the number of executive officers whom it has to watch,\r\n    and call to account when things go wrong. As soon as responsibility is\r\n    widely diffused in such a community, “deals” or bargains between\r\n    politicians for the division of the offices at once begin.\r\n\r\nIn no community, homogeneous or heterogeneous, can public affairs be\r\nmanaged successfully when the supreme Legislature always stands ready to\r\nremodel the Charter whenever the minority in the City can command the\r\nsupport of the majority in the State. It is bad enough in London when the\r\nminority in the County Council can appeal to the majority in the House of\r\nCommons. But the House of Commons only interferes by way of obstructing\r\nlegislation desired by the Progressive majority. It never attempts to\r\nrevolutionise the constitution of the Council, because the majority at\r\nWestminster does not agree with the majority at Spring Gardens.\r\n\r\nIt would not be a very great exaggeration to say that in the past the only\r\neffective government of the City of New York has consisted of Tammany Hall\r\nExecutive as a Lower House, and the Legislature at Albany as an Upper\r\nChamber. These two bodies were not shadows. They were both governing\r\nrealities. When Tammany did not control the State Legislature, Albany was\r\nthe only hope of the despairing Republicans. How constant was the\r\ninterference of the State Legislature may be inferred from the fact,\r\nvouched for by a return presented to a State Commission on the Government\r\nof Cities, that in the ten years between 1880-9 no fewer than 399\r\ndifferent amending laws were passed at Albany affecting the Charter of New\r\nYork City. A State Legislature which passes nearly forty laws every year\r\nchanging or amending the City Charter is a factor to be reckoned with.\r\n\r\nThe demand for Home Rule for the city, often repeated, does not seem to be\r\nsupported in earnest by either party. Both admit the need for it. But\r\nneither seem willing to risk anything to obtain it. The Charter of the\r\nGreater New York sprang from the Commission appointed in 1896 to consider\r\nand report upon the proposed consolidation and unification of the\r\ngovernment of the great urban area now known as Greater New York. The\r\nsubject had long been under discussion, but when the Charter came to be\r\ndrafted many drew back. Mr. Croker asserted that if the citizens had been\r\npermitted to vote yea or nay upon the adoption it would never have come\r\ninto force. The Referendum was not permitted, and the Charter came into\r\nforce this year without the preliminary of a popular mass vote.\r\n\r\nGeneral Tracy, the Republican candidate at the recent election, was\r\nPresident of the Charter Commission, with Mr. De Witt as Chairman of the\r\nCommittee. Among the other members were Mr. Strong, the Mayor of New York;\r\nMr. Seth Low, the first Tsar-Mayor of Brooklyn; Mr. Gilroy, Tammany\r\ncomptroller of the City of New York, and several other influential men.\r\nThey unanimously agreed to recommend the Charter as it stands at present,\r\nalthough Mr. Seth Low and Mayor Strong dissented from one or two of its\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners set to work in the belief that they were framing a\r\nconstitution for a city which in the lifetime of those now living would\r\nhave 6,000,000 citizens. Mr. De Witt, the Chairman of the Committee, who\r\ntells us that “his embattled energies laboured at the Charter for eight\r\nlong consecrated months,” contemplated with pride the result of his\r\nhandiwork. Speaking of the Charter, he declares:--\r\n\r\n    It is adequate to all the emergencies of the vast future. It is\r\n    constructed not merely for the present, but for many centuries to\r\n    come. It has in it all the virtues of existing charters and the vices\r\n    of none. It will adapt itself to any extent of domain, and to any\r\n    multiple of population. As well with a population of ten millions as\r\n    with a population of three millions, it will give to each\r\n    neighbourhood the utmost care and attention, and to the imperial\r\n    metropolis, as a whole, the utmost dignity and power. The form of\r\n    government for Greater New York, it will be the model upon which\r\n    Greater London will be constructed.\r\n\r\nWithout making quite such a lofty claim for the Charter as this, there is\r\nno doubt that it is an important document, and one which will well repay a\r\ncareful study. It is somewhat voluminous, filling with its annexes no less\r\nthan one thousand pages.\r\n\r\nIt has, however, been made the subject of a very painstaking and lucid\r\nanalysis by Dr. Albert Shaw, whose “Studies of Municipal Administration in\r\nthe Old World and the New” entitle him to speak with some authority on the\r\nmatters dealt with by the Charter. His analysis of the Charter was\r\npublished in the _Atlantic Monthly_ for June, 1897, under the title of\r\n“The Municipal Programme of Greater New York.” Mr. De Witt published his\r\nclear and concise idea of the Greater New York in _Munsey’s Magazine_,\r\nunder the title of “Moulding the Metropolis.” The Charter itself, with its\r\n1,620 sections, has been published in popular form at 10 cents by the\r\nBrooklyn _Daily Eagle_. The text of the Charter, with the aid of Dr.\r\nShaw’s and Mr. De Witt’s analyses, enables any one to form a tolerably\r\nclear idea as to what the Charter does and what the Charter means.\r\n\r\nMr. Croker repeatedly assured me, before the recent Mayoral contest began,\r\nthat the Charter was a monstrosity and an absurdity, that the system of\r\ngovernment which it established must inevitably break down, and that not\r\neven an archangel could make it work satisfactorily. Mr. Croker can hardly\r\nbe said to be an impartial judge, but his verdict is sufficiently in\r\naccord with that of Dr. Shaw to justify very grave misgivings as to the\r\nprospect before the second city of the world.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay in New York I was simply besieged by interviewers, begging\r\nme to tell them what I thought of the Charter. I turned a deaf ear to\r\ntheir solicitations, preferring to make a more careful study of the\r\nCharter itself with the advantage of the analysis of Dr. Shaw. Even now I\r\nrather shrink from expressing an opinion, lest it should be misconstrued\r\nas implying any claim on my part to sit in judgment on those who are\r\nsaddled with the responsibility of governing New York. But when doctors\r\ndiffer, the people decide, and when local experts are at hopeless variance\r\nas to the merits or demerits of the Charter, it may perhaps be permitted\r\nto a British onlooker, even at a distance of 3,000 miles, to put on record\r\nthe way in which the Charter strikes him. If this should not be denied me,\r\nI may say at once that the Charter seems to have written on its face\r\nthoroughgoing distrust of the people. The aspect of the Charter is black\r\nwith despair. It is far worse as an expression of democratic despair than\r\nthe Brooklyn Charter, for the Brooklyn Charter at least trusted the\r\nTsar-Mayor, whereas the New York Charter shrinks even from doing that.\r\n\r\nIn explaining the provisions of the Charter, I prefer to quote from Dr.\r\nShaw’s analysis. He says:--\r\n\r\n    First comes the mayor, who is entitled the chief executive. He is to\r\n    be elected for four years and is not eligible for an immediate\r\n    re-election, and his salary is to be 15,000 dols. a year. The business\r\n    of city administration is divided into eighteen executive departments.\r\n    These are the departments of finance, of law, of police, of water\r\n    supply, of highways, of street-cleaning, of sewers, of public\r\n    buildings, lighting and supplies, of bridges, of parks, of building,\r\n    of public charities, of correction, of fire, of docks and ferries, of\r\n    taxes and assessments, of education, and of health.\r\n\r\nThe members of all these boards, with one exception, are appointed by the\r\nMayor, not elected by the people. The one exception is the City\r\nComptroller, who is at the head of the Finance Department. He is elected\r\nat the same time as the Mayor. The Mayor also appoints all the members of\r\nthe five school boards, which look after education in the five boroughs of\r\nGreater New York:--\r\n\r\n    The system provided for in the new charter puts the executive\r\n    government wholly into the hands of the eighteen departments, which\r\n    are practically supreme in their respective eighteen spheres, except\r\n    as they are limited by two important groups, or boards--namely, the\r\n    board of estimate and apportionment and the board of public\r\n    improvements. One discovers with some surprise that the\r\n    ordinance-making power, which would nominally belong exclusively to\r\n    the municipal assembly, is, in the Greater New York charter, conferred\r\n    upon all the executive departments.\r\n\r\nWhere then, it will be asked, does the Municipal Assembly come in, for\r\nthere is a Municipal Assembly which is divided into two chambers? To which\r\nthe answer is that the Municipal Assembly is practically reduced to the\r\nfunction of a debating society; for, says Dr. Shaw:--\r\n\r\n    The eighteen executive departments take away from the municipal\r\n    assembly the larger part of the ordinance-making power; the board of\r\n    public improvements in practice controls municipal plans and policies\r\n    as regards the construction of works, and the board of estimate and\r\n    apportionment intervenes to prepare the budget, both on the side of\r\n    income and on that of disbursement.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the budget must be voted by the Municipal Assembly, which\r\non that occasion sits as one body. But its control is practically nil. The\r\nreal financial control is vested in the Board of Estimate and\r\nApportionment. Mr. F. V. Green, writing in _Scribner_ for October, 1896,\r\npoints out that the framers of this board carefully avoided the principle\r\nof direct election. He says:--\r\n\r\n    Probably in no other part of the globe, however autocratic its\r\n    government, is such power of taxation and appropriation committed to\r\n    so unrepresentative a body as in this foremost city of the land of\r\n    liberty, whose Government originated in a protest against taxation\r\n    without representation. And it is a still more curious anomaly that\r\n    this system, which was established as one of the results of the\r\n    overthrow of the Tweed _régime_, and has been in operation for\r\n    twenty-three years, is the most successful feature of the present form\r\n    of city government--the only one of which criticism is seldom heard.\r\n\r\nAfter this non-elective board has approved of the estimates, they are then\r\nsent down to the Municipal Assembly to be voted. But, says Dr. Shaw, the\r\nMunicipal Assembly\r\n\r\n    must complete its action within a certain number of days. It may not\r\n    add a penny to the estimates at any point whatsoever. It is permitted\r\n    to throw out items or to make reductions, but it must not offset these\r\n    by voting increased sums for any object. When it has completed its\r\n    consideration, the budget goes to the mayor for his final action. The\r\n    mayor has authority to veto any amendments that the municipal assembly\r\n    may have made. That is to say, he may restore any amounts that have\r\n    been subtracted.\r\n\r\nBut, it will be said, the Mayor’s veto may be overridden. It may, but only\r\nif there is a majority of five-sixths of the Municipal Assembly against\r\nhim. Such unanimity is practically unattainable.\r\n\r\nIt would, indeed, seem as if the chief purpose of the Municipal Assembly\r\nwas to give its members practical lessons in the working of simple sums of\r\nvulgar fractions. Again, to quote Dr. Shaw:--\r\n\r\n    No man will ever become intimate enough with the provisions of this\r\n    charter--no matter how many years he may sit in the municipal\r\n    assembly--to know for a certainty, without careful reference to the\r\n    document, by what kind of a majority a particular piece of business\r\n    must be carried to have validity. Some actions in the municipal\r\n    assembly may be taken by a majority of those present and voting,\r\n    provided there is a quorum. Other things may be done by a simple\r\n    majority of all those elected; still others require a two-thirds\r\n    majority of all those elected, others a three-fourths majority, others\r\n    a four-fifths majority, others a five-sixths majority, and others\r\n    absolute unanimity. I suspect that there may be still other\r\n    percentages or proportions requisite for certain actions; but the\r\n    seven that I have mentioned have caught my attention, as I have\r\n    endeavoured to run through the document.\r\n\r\nIn the report of the Commission presenting the Charter, the Commissioners\r\npoint out that the Charter introduces, “in accordance with established\r\nAmerican polity, a variety of checks and safeguards against the abuse of\r\nthe powers conferred upon the Municipal Assembly.” There is no doubt on\r\nthat head. The distrust of the popular elected assembly appears at every\r\nturn. The popular assembly is emasculated from the very first moment of\r\nits existence. It is carefully deprived of the right of initiative in\r\nmatters of the first moment, and elaborate provisions are made for\r\ndepriving it of the exercise of the authority which in England we should\r\nregard as absolutely indispensable. To begin with, the Municipal Assembly\r\nis forbidden to grant any franchise or right to use the public streets\r\nexcept upon the approval of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment, and\r\nthen only for limited periods, with due provision for periodical\r\nre-valuations. The Municipal Assembly is not allowed to sanction any work\r\ninvolving the expenditure of any large sum of money, or to create any\r\ndebt, to dispose of any franchise, or to levy any tax, without the\r\nconcurrence of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment. Even then its\r\ndecision is subject to the veto of the Mayor. In cases of public\r\nimprovements of great magnitude and cost, the Municipal Assembly cannot\r\nvote by a simple majority. Unless it can muster a majority of\r\nthree-quarters of its whole membership it can do nothing. It is possible,\r\ntherefore, for one quarter of the Assembly, plus one, to paralyse that\r\nbody at will. In fact, it is impossible adequately to explain the\r\nimpotence of the Assembly which, according to ordinary English ideas,\r\nought to be the source, seat and centre of all powers. No doubt clauses\r\nexist conferring upon the Assembly certain powers, but at the end of the\r\nclauses you will always find that they have not to be exercised excepting\r\non the initiative of some Department which is not elective, or with the\r\nconcurrence of some Board which is equally free from the taint of a\r\npopular elective origin.\r\n\r\nAll that, however, is consistent enough with the Napoleonic conception of\r\nthe true method of democratic government. Napoleon, with his ministers of\r\nstate, never claimed to exercise such control over the _Corps Législatif_\r\nas the Mayor of Greater New York will exercise over his elective assembly.\r\nHe is allowed a free hand to appoint his own executive, and he can pass\r\nhis own budget, so long as he can find one-sixth, plus one, of the\r\nAssembly to support him. The creation of the Tsar-Mayor, however\r\ninteresting as indicative of the rooted distrust of elective assemblies\r\nwhich is supreme at present in the American mind, is not the feature of\r\nthe Charter which reveals most deeply how far the distrust of popular\r\ngovernment has gone in the United States. For, after giving the Mayor\r\nsupreme responsibility, and electing him for a term of four years, these\r\nastonishing charter-makers carefully provide that he shall only have a\r\nright to remove the commissioners, whom he has been allowed to appoint,\r\nduring the first six months of his term of office. It is this limitation\r\nwhich shows how thoroughly the modern American distrusts his governing\r\nmen. Faith in an elective council has perished utterly; but faith in a\r\nTsar-Mayor might have shown the survival of some faith in the elective\r\nprinciple. But the stipulation carefully made in the Charter that the\r\nMayor’s right to remove the heads of departments whom he has nominated\r\nshall cease six months after his election, is the most astounding\r\nillustration yet afforded of the deep-rooted distrust which the American\r\nof to-day has in all elected men.\r\n\r\nEx-Mayor Grace, writing after much experience of the working of city\r\ngovernments, declared:--\r\n\r\n    The absolute power of removal as well as of appointment of all\r\n    commissioners and heads of departments should be vested in the mayor,\r\n    the power of removal to be subject to no check beyond that of filing\r\n    the reasons for such removals--expressed in writing.\r\n\r\nMr. Seth Low, the first Tsar-Mayor of Brooklyn, and Mr. Strong, the Mayor\r\nof the Reform Administration in New York, both declared, in a\r\nsupplementary report, their conviction that the authority given to the\r\nMayor to make appointments without confirmation ought to carry with it, as\r\na matter of course, the authority to make removals in the public interest\r\nwithout charges at any time. Their protests, however, were overruled. The\r\nmajority dare not trust the Mayor with such powers. The result is that\r\n“for three years and six months the government of the City of New York\r\nwill be carried on by eighteen separate departments, not one of which is\r\ndirectly responsible or accountable to anybody. They do not derive\r\nauthority directly from the people, and they certainly owe nothing to the\r\nMunicipal Assembly. On the other hand, there is no power in the Mayor to\r\nhold them accountable.” Says Dr. Shaw:--\r\n\r\n    It is bureaucracy pure and simple. I am not ready to assert it\r\n    positively, but I am of the impression, from some knowledge of the\r\n    subject, that the very shadowy municipal assemblies provided some\r\n    years ago for St. Petersburg and Moscow had a greater legislative and\r\n    financial authority than the new municipal assembly of the Greater\r\n    New York; and I am inclined to believe that neither in the\r\n    administration of those Russian cities nor in the administration of\r\n    the Russian provincial governments will one find a bureaucratic system\r\n    so complete and so indirect in its responsibilities to the public as\r\n    the bureaucracy which the Greater New York charter creates.\r\n\r\nThere is no necessity to go further. I have quoted enough to justify the\r\ntitle of “Despairing Democracy”; for here we have a democracy in such\r\ndepths of despair that it first emasculates its elective assembly, and\r\nthen hamstrings its Cæsar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP SHOWING THE LIMITS OF GREATER NEW YORK, AS DEFINED BY\r\nTHE MUNICIPAL CONSOLIDATION INQUIRY COMMISSION.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. W. R. HEARST. Editor and Proprietor of the _New York\r\nJournal_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT BY NEWSPAPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwelve years ago I employed part of the leisure I enjoyed in the safe\r\nretreat of Holloway Gaol in writing an essay on “Government by\r\nJournalism.” In that essay, which was published after my release in the\r\n_Contemporary Review_, and subsequently republished under the title “A\r\nJournalist on Journalism,” I expounded a theory as to the natural and\r\ninevitable emergence of the journalist as the ultimate depository of power\r\nin modern democracy. One passage I may be permitted to quote, as it bears\r\ndirectly upon the subject of the present chapter:--\r\n\r\n    The future of journalism depends almost entirely upon the journalist,\r\n    and at present the outlook is not very hopeful. The very conception of\r\n    journalism as an instrument of government is foreign to the mind of\r\n    most journalists. Yet, if they could but think of it, the editorial\r\n    pen is a sceptre of power, compared with which the sceptre of many a\r\n    monarch is but a gilded lath. In a democratic age, in the midst of a\r\n    population which is able to read, no position is comparable for\r\n    permanent influence and far-reaching power to that of an editor who\r\n    understands his vocation. In him are vested almost all the attributes\r\n    of real sovereignty. He has almost exclusive rights of initiative; he\r\n    retains a permanent right of direction; and, above all, he better than\r\n    any man is able to generate that steam, known as public opinion, which\r\n    is the greatest force of politics.\r\n\r\n    To rule--the very idea begets derision from those whose one idea of\r\n    their high office is to grind out so much copy, to be only paid for\r\n    according to quantity, like sausages or rope-yarn. Bunyan’s man with\r\n    the muck-rake has many a prototype on the press. To dress contemporary\r\n    controversy day by day in the jacket of party, to serve up with fresh\r\n    sauce of current events the hackneyed commonplaces of politics--that\r\n    in their eyes is journalism; but to rule! Yet an editor is the\r\n    uncrowned king of an educated democracy. The range of his power is\r\n    limited only by the extent of his knowledge, the quality rather than\r\n    the quantity of his circulation, and the faculty and force which he\r\n    can bring to the work of government.\r\n\r\n    An extraordinary idea seems to prevail with the eunuchs of the craft\r\n    that leadership, guidance, governance, are alien to the calling of a\r\n    journalist. Those conceptions of what is a journalist’s duty, if\r\n    indeed they recognise that imperious word as having any bearing upon\r\n    their profession, is hid in mystery. If it may be inferred from their\r\n    practice, their ideal is to grind out a column of more or less\r\n    well-balanced sentences, capable of grammatical construction,\r\n    conflicting with no social conventionality or party prejudice, which\r\n    fills so much space in the paper, and then utterly, swiftly, and for\r\n    ever vanishes from mortal mind. How can they help to make up other\r\n    people’s minds when they have never made up their own?\r\n\r\n    Even as it now is, with all its disabilities and all its limitations,\r\n    the press is almost the most effective instrument for discharging many\r\n    of the functions of government now left us. It has been, as Mr.\r\n    Gladstone remarked, and still is, the most potent engine for the\r\n    reform of abuses that we possess, and it has succeeded to many of the\r\n    functions formerly monopolised by the House of Commons. But all that\r\n    it has been is but a shadow going before of the substance which it may\r\n    yet possess, when all our people have learned to read, and the press\r\n    is directed by men with the instinct and capacity of government.\r\n\r\nNow it so happened by a curious coincidence that just about the time I was\r\npenning these sentences in happy Holloway, a youth fresh from Harvard, the\r\nheir to one of the greatest fortunes in the United States, was deciding to\r\ndevote his life to the journalistic profession. Mr. W. R. Hearst was the\r\nson of Senator Hearst, one of the lucky handful of men who came out from\r\nthe development of the silver mines of the Far West with many solid\r\nmillions of sterling gold in his possession. As heir to the Hearst\r\nmillions, nothing would have been more in accordance with the ways of the\r\nmillionaire class than for the young graduate to have given himself up to\r\na life of self-indulgent ease. Young Hearst, however, had no inclination\r\nfor sloth. Journalism attracted him, and he set himself to learn the\r\nbusiness of the craft. Money, of course, was available to secure him ample\r\nopportunity to indulge his whim, and before long he began to try his\r\nprentice hand as editor and proprietor of the _San Francisco Examiner_. He\r\nsoon proved that he possessed the editorial instinct as well as the\r\ncapitalist’s purse, and the _Examiner_ began to be heard of far beyond the\r\nPacific Coast as one of the smartest specimens of American journalism.\r\n\r\nBut the Pacific Coast is a long way off. To reign in San Francisco is less\r\nthan to serve in New York, and Mr. Hearst soon began to turn a longing eye\r\nto the Eastern capital. The same loadstone that drew Mr. Pulitzer from St.\r\nLouis to make the _New York World_ the latest and greatest of American\r\nnewspapers, compelled Mr. Hearst to come to the same city to found a\r\nnewspaper which would be even later and greater than the _World_. It was\r\nwith Mr. Hearst as it was with Themistocles when the laurels of Miltiades\r\nwould not allow him to sleep. The laurels of Mr. Pulitzer were equally\r\nproductive of insomnia in the _Examiner_ office. At last, when Senator\r\nHearst died, and the young editor of thirty found himself in undisputed\r\ncontrol of a million or two--pounds, not dollars--with a reversionary\r\nright, on the death of his mother, to several millions more, he was in a\r\nposition to realise his ambition. Crossing the continent, he purchased the\r\n_New York Morning Journal_ from Mr. Pulitzer’s brother Albert, and began\r\nthe siege of New York. The _World_ was then in the height of its\r\nprosperity. In ten years it had built up a circulation without a rival in\r\nthe Western hemisphere. The Paris _Petit Journal_ alone distanced the\r\n_World_ in Europe. The great gilded dome of the _World_ office, which\r\nevery night, radiant with electric light, sits as a crown of flame upon\r\nthe city’s brow, did not rise more conspicuously above the other buildings\r\nin its vicinity than the _World_ towered aloft above its contemporaries.\r\nWhen Mr. Hearst sat down in New York he had one ambition, and--so far as\r\nhe allowed any one to see his secret thoughts--one ambition only. He would\r\npublish a newspaper which would beat the _World_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. JOSEPH PULITZER. Editor and Proprietor of the _New York\r\nWorld_.]\r\n\r\nHe began operations by annexing the pick of the staff of the _World_.\r\nJournalists in the United States sit by no means so tightly in their\r\nchairs as they do in this country. The Americans are a restless race.\r\nWhether it is that the nomad Redskin left a migratory contagion in the\r\nair, or whether the force of gravitation has been suspended on their\r\nbehalf, or whatever else the cause may be, the fact is indisputable.\r\nWhether in politics, in the press, or elsewhere, they shift about with a\r\nreadiness that seems strangely unnatural to the more stolid Englishman,\r\nwho is apt to root himself like his native oak. Hence it was possible for\r\nMr. Hearst to begin his campaign in New York by taking away from Mr.\r\nPulitzer several of the brightest and brainiest members of his staff. They\r\nleft the _World_ to form the staff of the _Journal_, with regrets no\r\ndoubt, but without hesitation. For the terms of Mr. Hearst were better\r\nthan those of Mr. Pulitzer, and they went. Mr. Pulitzer, alarmed by the\r\nsecession, induced some of them to return by the offer of still better\r\nterms than Mr. Hearst, but the young man with the inherited millions\r\noutbid the older journalist who had made his own pile, and the _Journal_\r\nstarted with the cream of the _World’s_ staff. If there be something of\r\nDugald Dalgetty about this sudden transfer of allegiance in English eyes,\r\nit was entirely in accordance with the habits and customs of American\r\njournalism. A change in proprietors or in editors will be followed by a\r\nfiling out of all the staff, the members of which no more lament over\r\ntheir fate than gipsies deplore the fall of their tent-poles.\r\n\r\nTo the men recruited from the _Journal_, Mr. Hearst added some of the best\r\nof his Californian staff, and as he paid the highest salaries going, he\r\nhad the pick of the pressmen of the continent. He picked as a rule wisely\r\nand well. But his first choice and the most valuable member of his staff\r\nwas himself. No one did more to give the newspaper character and success\r\nthan the young millionaire, who was to be seen in his shirt-sleeves\r\nthrough the hottest nights in the sultry summer toiling away at proofs and\r\nformes until the early hours when he saw his paper to press. Members of\r\nhis staff who were worked like niggers could not complain when they saw\r\ntheir chief working harder than any of his salaried employees. “A\r\nmillionaire,” they said, “in his shirt-sleeves! He could not work harder\r\nif he were working on space for his daily bread!”\r\n\r\nAfter having formed his staff, Mr. Hearst launched his paper, publishing\r\nit at a cent. The _New York Herald_ is published at three cents. The\r\n_World_ was published at two cents. Mr. Hearst published morning after\r\nmorning an eight and a twelve page paper at a price below the cost of\r\nproduction. Mr. Pulitzer, recognising that at last he had found a real\r\nrival, reduced the price of the _World_ to a cent. From that day to this\r\nthe two rivals have wrestled together without ceasing. They both publish\r\nmorning and afternoon and Sunday editions. They both are profusely\r\nillustrated. They both cater directly and avowedly for the million, and\r\nthe million responds. The weaker of the old-fashioned papers went down\r\nbeneath the feet of the contending giants as the forests went down under\r\nthe trampling of St. Tammany and the Devil. But the circulation of the\r\n_Journal_ went up steadily, until in two years Mr. Hearst had a Sunday\r\ncirculation of 400,000 at five cents, while the average daily sales of the\r\nmorning and evening journals reached 350,000. The circulation of the\r\n_World_ was not seriously impaired. The _Journal_ grew not at the expense\r\nof its rival so much as at the expense of the other papers which were less\r\nup-to-date.\r\n\r\nOf course this result was not achieved without prodigious expenditure.\r\nNever before were such salaries paid on any newspaper. The secrets of the\r\ncounting-house are not revealed to the outside world, but Mr. Hearst is\r\nsaid to have half-a-dozen editors and artists, each of whom draws the\r\nsalary of a Cabinet Minister. Money flowed like water. Nothing was too\r\nmuch to pay for a first-class, exclusive piece of intelligence.\r\nJournalists of the old school stood aghast at the _Journal’s_ prices. And,\r\nwhat made the expenditure appear still more outrageous, for a long time\r\nthere were practically no receipts. Advertisers, even in the United\r\nStates, are a conservative race. A newspaper appealed in vain for their\r\nsupport. They would come in, but only at low prices. Mr. Hearst said they\r\nmight stay out; they must come in at his prices or not at all. They took\r\nhim at his word and stayed out--for a time. But now they are coming in\r\nshoals, and the advertisement columns day by day attest the capitulation\r\nof the advertiser to the newspaper. The direct cash loss on the first\r\nyear’s editing of the _Journal_ could hardly be less than £200,000, if,\r\nindeed, it did not largely exceed that sum.\r\n\r\nPeople began to wonder what Mr. Hearst was after. He could not be after\r\nthe dollars--he had more dollars than he could count. He was not known to\r\nhave any distinctive political aspirations. He was spoken of sometimes as\r\nthe Socialist millionaire, but he never professed any belief in Socialism\r\nas a dogma of his creed. Was it only to beat the _World_? Who could say.\r\nThe _Journal_ plunged heavily and got hit badly by its advocacy of\r\nBryanism and Free Silver, but Mr. Hearst was no fanatic of silver. He was\r\nnot a fanatic at all. He was a man as modest in private life as his paper\r\nwas blatant in print. His editorials were searched in vain to discover any\r\nconsistent or inconsistent creed. The _Journal_ was like Broadway in\r\nprint. Broadway at high noon, with cars swinging backwards and forwards\r\nalong the tracks, and the myriad, multitudes streaming this way and\r\nthat--life everywhere, but one common governing purpose or direction\r\nnowhere.\r\n\r\nBut after a time there was gradually evolved from this feverish chaos of\r\nsensationalism some trace of a great conception. Mr. Croker, who, although\r\nnot glib of tongue, is shrewd of wit and keen of eye, discerned its drift,\r\nand set himself to ridicule and belittle what he called “government by\r\nnewspaper.” Then the _Journal_ itself, taking heart of grace from a series\r\nof successes, boldly printed at the head of its editorial columns:--\r\n\r\n    THE “JOURNAL’S” MOTTO:\r\n\r\n    “WHILE OTHERS TALK, THE ‘JOURNAL’ ACTS.”\r\n\r\nThis appeared immediately after the announcement of the release of the\r\nfair heroine Evangelina Cisneros from her Cuban gaol by the enterprise of\r\na _Journal_ reporter. It was followed by an editorial entitled “The\r\nJournalism that Does Things.” This article expresses so succinctly the\r\naims and objects of a paper which has played so conspicuous a part in the\r\nrecent history of New York that I have no hesitation in quoting it here:--\r\n\r\n    The instant recognition accorded throughout the world, outside of\r\n    Weyler’s palace and offices of most New York newspapers, to the work\r\n    of the heroes who, in the service of the _Journal_ and of humanity,\r\n    rescued Evangelina Cisneros from the prison of the Recojidas is\r\n    broader and deeper than a mere compliment to a single newspaper. It is\r\n    epochal. It signifies that by a supreme achievement the journalism of\r\n    action, which is called by its detractors the “new journalism,” and\r\n    proudly accepts the title, has broken down the barriers of prejudice\r\n    and vindicated its animating principle.\r\n\r\n    Action--that is the distinguishing mark of the new journalism. It\r\n    represents the final stage in the evolution of the modern newspaper of\r\n    a century ago--the “new journals” of their day--told the news, and\r\n    some of them made great efforts to get it first. The new journal of\r\n    to-day prints the news too, but it does more. It does not wait for\r\n    things to turn up. It turns them up.\r\n\r\n    It has taken some time for the understanding and appreciation of these\r\n    novel methods to become general, but from the very first the _Journal_\r\n    has found an immense constituency eager to welcome them. It has\r\n    provided for this sympathetic body of readers a continuous succession\r\n    of notable deeds. We may recall a few examples.\r\n\r\n    The _Journal_ has always been an energetic ally of the Cuban patriots.\r\n    It has rendered them a variety of important services, of which the\r\n    rescue of Miss Cisneros is merely the latest. Another of a similar,\r\n    through less dramatic sort, was its action in forcing the Spanish\r\n    authorities to issue passports to the widow and children of Dr.\r\n    Ricardo Ruiz, the American dentist who was murdered by his gaolers in\r\n    Havana.\r\n\r\n    When the _Casper Whitney_ put to sea with water oozing in through\r\n    every joint, the _Journal_ secured an investigation which resulted in\r\n    the removal of Captain Fairchild, of the inspection service.\r\n\r\n    The _Journal_ proved by experiments with chartered vessels off Sandy\r\n    Hook that the ordinary flags of the international signal code could be\r\n    easily read at night from a great distance under flashlight\r\n    illumination. This discovery, whose value in saving life and property\r\n    at sea is incalculable, it dedicated freely to the maritime world.\r\n\r\n    From the beginning the _Journal_ has taken a practical as well as a\r\n    theoretical interest in the relief of suffering and the elevation of\r\n    the classes that have lacked a fair chance in life. Last winter it\r\n    undertook to mitigate the awful distress that prevailed so widely at\r\n    that time by opening a depôt in Grand Street, at which hot food was\r\n    distributed daily to those in need. Thousands of starving people were\r\n    relieved by this enterprise. On another occasion, when a fire in\r\n    East Thirty-fifth Street rendered many families homeless, the\r\n    _Journal_ invited them all to a Christmas dinner, and then, with the\r\n    co-operation of its readers, established them in newly-furnished\r\n    homes. But the greatest work of the _Journal_ in the direction of the\r\n    improvement of social conditions has been the establishment and\r\n    maintenance of the _Journal_ Junior Republic, which has saved about\r\n    two hundred boys from the slums, and turned them into good citizens,\r\n    and which contains the promise of unlimited future development and\r\n    expansion.\r\n\r\n    Last winter, when the aldermen had undertaken to grant a perpetual\r\n    franchise for the use of the streets to a light, fuel and power\r\n    company, the _Journal_ served injunctions upon the board and prevented\r\n    the outrage. At the same time it fought at Albany for dollar gas with\r\n    such success that even Mr. Platt’s Legislature was compelled to yield\r\n    to public opinion to the extent of passing a bill providing for a\r\n    general reduction. The practice of invoking the law against unfaithful\r\n    public servants has been repeated recently with signal success in the\r\n    case of Commissioner of Public Works Collis and his pet contractors,\r\n    who have been compelled to raise the siege of Fifth Avenue.\r\n\r\n    When the East River murder seemed an insoluble mystery to the police,\r\n    the _Journal_ organised a detective force of its own, and in two or\r\n    three days identified the victim, Guldensuppe, and his assassins. And\r\n    when the Long Island Railroad attempted to excuse its wholesale\r\n    manslaughter at Valley Stream by alleging that an engine could be seen\r\n    for a distance of one thousand five hundred feet, the _Journal_ took a\r\n    counterpart of the wrecked tally-ho outfit to the scene, and proved by\r\n    actual measurement that the driver could not have seen the approaching\r\n    train until his leaders were on the track, with the engine eighty-four\r\n    feet away.\r\n\r\n    These are a few of the public services by which the _Journal_ has\r\n    illustrated its theory that a newspaper’s duty is not confined to\r\n    exhortation, but that when things are going wrong it should itself set\r\n    them right if possible. The brilliant exemplication of this theory in\r\n    the rescue of Miss Cisneros has finally commended it to the approval\r\n    of almost the entire reading world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RIVERSIDE DRIVE AND GRANT’S TOMB.]\r\n\r\nThese things, all of them, or almost all, are good. Some of them are very\r\ngood. But all of them together do not prove that in Mr. Hearst we have the\r\nman of whom Mr. Lowell spoke when he said:--\r\n\r\n    Methinks the editor who should understand his calling and be equal\r\n    thereto, would truly deserve that title of ποιμὴν λαῶν, which Homer\r\n    bestows upon princes, he would be the Moses of our nineteenth century\r\n    ... the Captain of our Exodus into the Canaan of a truer social order.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Mr. Hearst is far and away the most promising journalist\r\nwhom I have yet come across. He has education, youth, energy, aptitude,\r\nwealth, and that instinctive journalistic sense which is akin to genius.\r\nIf in addition to these great qualifications he were to realise the\r\npossibilities of his vocation, and to become inspired by a supreme\r\nenthusiasm--say to redeem New York, and make the second city in the world\r\nin size the first city of the world as a place of human habitation--there\r\nis no knowing what incalculable good might lie within his grasp. Certainly\r\nno man in all New York has such a chance of combining all the elements\r\nthat make for righteousness and progress in the city as the young\r\nCalifornian millionaire-editor who founded the _Journal_.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, no greater delusion than to imagine that a newspaper in\r\nAmerica has any influence merely because it is a newspaper. The habit of\r\nrunning newspapers as if they were mere commercial dividend-earning\r\nundertakings has so largely discounted the influence of the press as to\r\nlead many shrewd observers to declare that they would just as soon have\r\nthe newspapers against them as in their favour. Carter Harrison had every\r\nnewspaper in Chicago against him--but his own--and he was elected to the\r\nmayoralty by an overwhelming majority. Mr. Croker declared over and over\r\nagain that if he had stood for the mayoralty of New York he would wish for\r\nnothing better than that every newspaper in the city should be against\r\nhim, in which case he regarded his success as a certainty. Tammany at one\r\ntime corrupted the newspapers. At another time it bullied them. Now it\r\ndisregards them. “Mere newspaper talk”--nothing can be more contemptuous\r\nthan that.\r\n\r\nIf New York is to be raised to the position of being the ideal city of the\r\nNew World it will not have to be by mere newspaper talk, but by the man\r\nbehind the newspaper who can make his newspaper the organising, vivifying,\r\nrallying centre for all the best forces and influences of the city. If Mr.\r\nHearst has soul enough and heart enough he may do it. I do not know any\r\none else who has got his chance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAMMANY HALL OF TO-DAY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS C. PLATT. Chief of the Republican Party in New\r\nYork.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nWHY NOT TRY THE INQUISITION?\r\n\r\n\r\n“Never prescribe until you are called in,” is an excellent maxim, which\r\nlike that other more pithy saying, “Mind your own business,” has one\r\nsomewhat serious drawback. If they were construed literally and obeyed in\r\nspirit as well as in letter, what would become of the journalist’s\r\nbusiness? For the chief business of the journalist is to look after other\r\npeople’s business. To chronicle it in the first place; to comment upon it\r\nin the second. It is the privilege of the profession.\r\n\r\nThere is no cause for resenting the innocent liberty of criticism and\r\nsuggestion which is exercised by the press. It can only too easily be\r\nignored; nor has the journalist any means beyond the opportunity of\r\nrepresentation and of persuasion for giving effect to his proposals. He\r\nhas no authority except that which belongs to every man who sees things as\r\nthey are, and the authority pertains to his ability to make others see\r\nthem with his eyes rather than to his personal position. Hence those who\r\nobject to the “damned impudence of the newspaper man” have only to shut\r\ntheir eyes and close their ears, to remove themselves effectively from the\r\narea of his jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe journalist who in the course of his public duty ventures to pry into\r\n“the secrets of the prison-house” is always met by its keepers with an\r\noutcry of indignation and resentment. “Why are you poking your nose in our\r\naffairs?” they cry in aggrieved chorus; “you stay at home and attend to\r\nyour own business!” How often have we not heard that plausible demand put\r\nforward by the thieves and scoundrels and oppressors of the world, when\r\nfirst the adventurous newspaper man ventures to expose their misdeeds and\r\nsuggest ways and means for curtailing their evil power. Tammany Bosses\r\nhave often angrily denounced the meddling of the newspapers in their\r\npickings and stealings. Nor is it only journalists who are met by this\r\nprotest. We have seen how Police Commissioner McClave was distressed at\r\nthe wickedness of the hayseed Senators up at Albany who sent the Lexow\r\nCommittee to trouble the “honest men” of the Police Department. The\r\nevildoer who is waxing fat upon his misdeeds, always objects to any one\r\ninterfering with his plunder. And as the accusation of officious meddling\r\nin “what is no concern of yours” is the first brick that lies handy for\r\nhurling at the head of the intruder, it is thrown accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is immeasurably increased when the journalist is commenting\r\non the affairs of another city or country than his own. For then the\r\ncrooks can invoke the sentiment of offended patriotism, and shelter their\r\npicking and stealing behind the sacred folds of the national flag. When I\r\nwas in Chicago five years ago I was seriously told by a distinguished\r\nAmerican author that it was insufferable impertinence on my part to\r\npublish any opinion on current American affairs until I foreswore\r\nallegiance to the Queen and naturalised myself as an American citizen! I\r\nventure humbly and with all deference to suggest that if a cat may look at\r\na king, it may be permitted to an English-speaking journalist to describe\r\nwhat he sees and to say what he thinks even concerning the affairs of\r\nthose other English-speaking communities which prefer the Stars and\r\nStripes to the Union Jack. This curious recrudescence of perverted\r\nnationalism which would deny the right of comment on American affairs to\r\neveryone not born or naturalised in the American Republic, is after all\r\nnothing more than a partial reversion to the savage’s jealousy of the\r\nstranger who was not a member of the tribe. Let us be thankful that the\r\nreversion is not complete, otherwise I should have cause for thankfulness\r\nthat I escaped with my life.\r\n\r\nWe may, however, brush on one side these absurdities born of the morbid\r\nsensitiveness of the Half-grown, who are always suspecting that every word\r\nof criticism conceals an assumption of superiority, and a denial of the\r\nrights which the Full-grown regard as too self-evident to be questioned.\r\nRational adults do not in these days require a certificate of origin\r\nbefore listening to the ideas of those who are interested in their\r\naffairs. The stranger, no doubt, will often make mistakes, which any tyro\r\nto the manner born would have avoided. He is like a Frenchman attempting\r\nto make a speech in English. But, despite his blunders in details, he\r\nlooks at things from a different standpoint, he brings to their\r\nconsideration the experience gained in other communities, and although he\r\nmay make himself a fool now and then--which Lowell reminded us is one of\r\nthe inalienable rights of man--he will often strike out new ideas which\r\nperhaps by their very absurdity may bear good fruit by rousing attention\r\nand provoking discussion.\r\n\r\nAt the close of this cursory survey of one of the gravest problems which\r\ncan occupy the attention of mankind, the reader may fairly expect me to\r\nsay whether I see any way out. Must we despair of democracy, then, after\r\nall, and abandon all hope of governing great cities by the time-honoured\r\nmachinery of elective assemblies? Is the Dictator indispensable for the\r\nsalvation of the Republic? And if we cannot get along without his\r\nauthority, dare we not trust him to remove his ministers after the first\r\neighth of his term of office?\r\n\r\nIf to these questions I venture to suggest any replies, I hope that I may\r\nnot be accused of attempting arrogantly to dogmatise upon the solution of\r\nlocal problems the conditions of which it has been obviously impossible\r\nfor me to master at first hand. I make no pretence to be free from bias or\r\npartiality. If my critics complain that my suggestions are based upon my\r\ninherited ingrained prejudices, strengthened by a professional instinct,\r\nrather than upon a scientific and judicial examination of all the facts, I\r\nmake no demur. For in dealing with all these complex questions it is\r\nextremely difficult to eliminate the habit of mind that dates back to the\r\ncradle and beyond the cradle.\r\n\r\nHence, for instance, if I scout the notion that there is any reason for\r\ndespairing of democracy even in New York City, this adoption of the\r\nwatchword of “Never despair!” is due primarily to two antecedent\r\nconvictions, neither of which has anything to do with the local\r\ncircumstances of New York. One is a fundamental faith in the Providential\r\ngovernment of the universe, the other a belief that in the evolution of\r\nhuman society, Democracy has arrived, and has come to stay. “Time brings\r\nnot back the mastodon”; and, despite the present reversion to the tyrant\r\nof the old Greek city, in the shape of the Tsar-Mayor, I cannot believe\r\nthat the great stream of progress is about to change its channel. I cannot\r\nbelieve that the American democracy is permanently forsaking what\r\nJefferson regarded as the fundamental principle of democratic\r\ninstitutions. Jefferson’s familiar and weighty words--“As Cato concluded\r\nevery speech with the words, _Delenda est Carthago_, so do I every opinion\r\nwith the injunction, ‘Divide the counties into wards’”--embody advice that\r\nis in accord with all the traditions of the English-speaking race. I may\r\nbe pardoned for believing that it expresses the sound principle of local\r\nself-government, rather than the new-fangled innovation of the vesting of\r\nall power in a Dictator elected by a mass vote of so huge a unit as a city\r\nof three millions.\r\n\r\nIf this be so, then it follows that it would be well to endeavour, as\r\nspeedily as it could be done with safety, to regain the ancient ways, and\r\nreturn to fundamental principles by dividing the city into wards, and\r\nmaking the elected representatives of these wards the governing authority\r\nof New York. Until the Common Council--composed of representatives each\r\ndirectly elected by ward or district, and held personally responsible by\r\nthe citizens in that ward for the efficient and honest discharge of his\r\nmunicipal duties--is restored to its natural position as the source and\r\nseat and centre of civic authority, it seems to me that we shall continue\r\nwandering in the wilderness. The elective assembly is the mainspring of\r\nthe machine, and although you may turn the pointers round with the\r\nwatchkey of a Tsar-Mayor, the watch will never keep right time till the\r\nmainspring is restored to its right place.\r\n\r\nThis, however, may only be an English prejudice. However frankly I may\r\nexpress my fear that the Tsar-Mayor will not prove a permanent source of\r\nsecurity to the law-abiding, honest citizens, I shall be delighted if my\r\nforebodings are falsified by the event. For good or for ill the great\r\nexperiment is to be tried, and the whole human race is interested in its\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nI come to safer ground when I say that, whether the centre of authority be\r\nthe Tsar-Mayor or the Common Council, there is no security for the good\r\ngovernment of the city except the public spirit and loyal co-operation of\r\nall good citizens. I know nothing more admirable than many of the recent\r\nefforts made by the Citizens’ Union and the Patriotic League of New York\r\nto arouse an intelligent interest in the community at large in the\r\ngovernment of the city. The campaign of Education which has been going on\r\nfor these last three years is a much more solid security for good\r\ngovernment than any tinkering of the civic administrative machine. What\r\nseems to be most needed is, that the admirable work done in certain\r\ndistricts should be universalised and made equally effective in all\r\nquarters of Greater New York. The need for making general or universal the\r\nbest work done in certain localities, points to the need of some central\r\nbody, like the Civic Federation or Citizens’ Union, or Civic Centre, which\r\nwould cover the same area as the civic administration, and within which it\r\nwould seek to secure for all voluntary effort the same system and\r\nregularity and universality that is attained in the municipal service.\r\nSuch a Civic Centre or nucleus for the co-operation of all societies and\r\nagencies, social, moral, intellectual and religious, would stand to the\r\ncivic authorities much as the spiritual power stands to the State. A\r\nfederation so constituted would be the Civic Church of the city; and the\r\nState without the Church, is the body without the soul.\r\n\r\nThese are broad general propositions, which seem to me to lie at the root\r\nof the whole matter. But I would not like to close this chapter without\r\nmaking one suggestion which, although it will be scouted at first and\r\ntreated with ridicule and contempt, may nevertheless contain within it the\r\ngerm of an institution which may remedy some of the more flagrant evils\r\nwhich afflict the body politic. The creation of the Tsar-Mayor shows that\r\nthe American citizen is not hidebound by prejudice. In presence of the\r\nhideous abuses glanced at in the former chapters he has sacrificed his\r\nancient prejudices against Despotism and the One Man power, in order to\r\nre-establish the Greek Tyrant as the autocrat of the American City. What I\r\nwish, with all deference, to suggest, is that having enthroned the\r\nTyrannus, they should hasten to establish the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nThe proposition is made in all seriousness. As a palliative and corrective\r\nfor the existing evils I see no suggested solution that holds out more\r\npromise.\r\n\r\nI need not, I hope, explain that I do not suggest the resurrection of the\r\nold dread ecclesiastical tribunal, with its familiars and its _auto da\r\nfe_. Neither do I suggest that heretics should be burned alive in Madison\r\nSquare. What I am after is much more serious business. The suggestion is\r\nthe offspring of two facts, both unmistakably conspicuous in the\r\ncontemporary history of New York. One is the emergence of a great\r\njournalistic ambition, not merely to chronicle, but to do. The other is\r\nthe record of the Lexow Committee. The success of the latter in its work\r\nof investigation, together with the existence of the new ideal of\r\njournalistic duty, seem to suggest that the best immediate remedy for the\r\nmalady of the body politic would be the establishment on a permanent\r\nfooting of a Tribunal of Investigation and Inquisition, armed with all\r\nnecessary powers, to administer oaths, to compel the attendance of\r\nwitnesses, to commit for contempt, and to punish summarily for perjury.\r\nAnd I would further venture to suggest that in the Journalism that Acts\r\nthere is here a field even more legitimate for the enterprise of the new\r\njournalists than breaking into a Spanish prison or dredging the river for\r\nthe head of a murdered man.\r\n\r\nTo put it briefly, I would respectfully ask those who are in despair over\r\nthe corruption that eats like a canker into the hearts of American cities,\r\nwhy not give statutory authority to American journalism to create,\r\nmaintain and carry on a Lexow Committee _en permanence_, with extended\r\npowers for the purpose of discovering and handing over for punishment all\r\nthose who are preying upon the public?\r\n\r\nThere is no remedy like the light of day. These evils exist in the midst\r\nof our communities because they can be done in secret. The crook in office\r\nrelies upon the cloak of darkness. Tear away that cloak, proclaim the\r\nthings done in secret upon the housetop, and the crook will walk in the\r\nstraight path. The enterprise of the American newspaper is great. But\r\nalthough it can discover Livingstone and rescue Miss Cisneros, it cannot\r\nlocate the boodler and prove who paid him the boodle. It may suspect. It\r\nmay know, and it may accuse. But without its Lexow Committee it can\r\nneither prove nor convict.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that to institute such a tribunal would be to create a\r\nfrightful engine of tyranny, and that the remedy might be worse than the\r\ndisease. The experience of the Star Chamber is not exactly reassuring.\r\n\r\nBut to this there are several answers. In the first place, beyond arming\r\nthe proposed Inquisition with adequate powers to enforce attendance by\r\nsubpœna, to punish contempt of court, and to impose summary penalties for\r\nperjury, it would not be vested with any power of inflicting punishment.\r\nHaving ascertained the facts, it would hand over the guilty person to the\r\nordinary civil and criminal tribunals, binding over all witnesses to\r\nappear when the case came on for trial. Its functions would be those of\r\ninvestigation, for the purpose of providing a case for the ordinary\r\ntribunals, so that there would be no interference with the safeguards\r\nprovided by the law and the constitution for the liberty of the subject\r\nand the impartial administration of justice.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the proceedings of the Inquisition would be from the first\r\nconducted under the full glare of publicity. Even if it were within its\r\npowers to hold a secret session, no action could be taken at such session\r\nuntil it had been confirmed in the light of day. Both at the inception and\r\nat the close of a case the Inquisition would be a public tribunal, liable\r\nto public criticism and amenable to public opinion. Its chief duty would\r\nbe the obtaining of material in the shape of authentic information capable\r\nof being proved in court, for the protection of the public. It would,\r\ntherefore, be unreasonable to fear that such a Court, whose _raison\r\nd’être_ is to bring evil out of the darkness into light, could be capable\r\nof the abuse which sprang up in the Star Chamber or the Inquisition, where\r\nsecrecy made power irresponsible.\r\n\r\nIf it be admitted that such a tribunal might with advantage be created,\r\nthe question would then arise how it should be constituted. The paralysis\r\nof faith in the integrity of the elected man which prevails in American\r\ncitizens would seem to preclude any hope of securing a competent and\r\ninflexible Inquisitor-General by an appeal to the principle of popular\r\nelection--direct or indirect. If, however, the Journalism that Acts is to\r\nbe allowed to follow the natural path of evolution, it might perhaps be\r\nrecognised as a power in the State, to whose initiative might be left by\r\nstatute the task of appointing the Inquisitor and of bringing cases before\r\nthe Inquisition. If the choice of Inquisitor-General were left to the\r\njournalists, each of whom is an inquisitor himself in his own way, you\r\nwould at least have a small expert constituency, each member of which\r\nwould have a direct interest in making a good selection. And if the duty\r\nof bringing cases before the Court were limited in the first instance to\r\nthe journalists, the door would be closed against the irresponsible\r\ncalumnies of miscellaneous scandal-mongers, for the only persons who could\r\nthen set the tribunal in motion would be the newspaper, which would lose\r\nin prestige and in authority should it bring forward a case which on\r\ninvestigation proved to be baseless.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that the suggestion will be ridiculed, and by no one so\r\nmuch as the journalist in whom the consciousness of his responsibility has\r\nnot yet been evolved. But if the Journalism that Acts is to do its share\r\nin the cleansing of the Augean stable of municipal corruption, it could\r\nhardly find a more legitimate field for development than in providing a\r\nsimple but effective tribunal for the purpose of dragging out of the\r\ndarkness and secrecy in which they flourish those evils which can never be\r\ndealt with until they are accurately located, and brought within the range\r\nof public opinion by the searchlight of the Inquisition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE ELEVATED RAILWAYS IN GREATER NEW YORK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL TRACY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE PLÉBISCITE FOR A CÆSAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contest for the mayoralty of Greater New York, which was fought out at\r\nthe polls on the 2nd of November, has been one of the most famous\r\nelections ever fought. To begin with, never before have half a million\r\nelectors voted in the same day for the election of a chief magistrate.\r\nGreater New York contains more that 3,000,000 inhabitants, and 567,000\r\nregistered electors. The constituency is not more vast than the powers of\r\nthe mayor are unlimited. As no chief magistrate before received the\r\nsuffrages of so many electors, so no chief magistrate was ever invested\r\nwith such absolute authority. Mr. Van Wyck, the new Mayor of Greater New\r\nYork, for six months at least is almost as much master of New York as\r\nNapoleon III. was master of France after the _plébiscite_ which installed\r\nhim at the Tuileries. The two-chambered elective council of the city has\r\neven less control over his municipal appointments than the senate and\r\n_Corps Législatif_ of the Second Empire. For so great a stake it was\r\nnatural that all parties should enter their best men, and that the contest\r\nshould be fought with as much energy as a Presidential Election.\r\n\r\nThe first to enter the field was Mr. Seth Low, the President of Columbian\r\nUniversity, and the candidate of the Citizens’ Union. Mr. Low--or Seth Low\r\nas he is usually called--was the first Reform Mayor of the City of\r\nBrooklyn, where he was re-elected and served a second term. Although he\r\nbelongs to the Republican party, he stood as the candidate of those who\r\nobject to the subordination of municipal to national issues. The one great\r\ncurse which has plagued New York in the past has been that its citizens\r\nnever had a chance of voting upon a straight civic issue, but were always\r\npulled hither and thither by the conflicting interest of the Republican or\r\nDemocratic parties, compared with whose real or imaginary interests the\r\nwelfare of the city was regarded as dust in the balance. Mr. Low was one\r\nof the leading members of the Commission which framed the Charter of\r\nGreater New York. He is a man of education, of leisure, of experience, and\r\nof the highest character. The Citizens’ Union was formed last winter in\r\nthe old City of New York, with the object of electing what is called a\r\nnon-partisan mayor. The Citizens’ Union, although nominally non-partisan,\r\nwas really recruited in a great measure by the Republicans. Hence it was\r\nregarded by the leaders of the Republican machine as virtually a revolt\r\nagainst the Republican Caucus, and the Chairman of the County Republican\r\nCommittee publicly declared that the Republican party would much rather\r\nsee a Tammany man installed as the first Mayor of Greater New York than a\r\nmayor who was not the nominee of the Republican organisation. And the\r\nRepublican Party men have had their wish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HIGHEST BUILDING IN NEW YORK. American Surety Company.]\r\n\r\nIt was this declaration that led Mr. Seth Low to join the Citizens’ Union,\r\nwhich he had not previously done. About the middle of the year, the ticket\r\nwhich had long been current as to the advisability of nominating Seth Low\r\nfor the Mayoralty began to crystallise into action. The Citizens’ Union\r\nhad increased its membership from 6,000 to 25,000, and it had secured\r\nnearly 100,000 signatures to a memorial requesting Mr. Low to be put in\r\nnomination as a candidate for the Mayoralty. Earlier in the year he had\r\ncontemplated standing only as a unifying force among the friends of good\r\ngovernment, but when the memorial was presented, and the Citizens’ Union\r\ninsisted upon taking independent action without conferring with the other\r\norganisations, he accepted the nomination, and in the beginning of\r\nSeptember issued his address.\r\n\r\nHis appeal to the constituency was based, according to his own statements,\r\nupon the following principles. First, he stood for the idea of having a\r\nfree man in the Mayor’s chair, a man who would be responsible to the\r\npeople who put him there, and not to any party machine. The Reform Mayor\r\nof New York, he said, in a passage which stung General Tracy into unwonted\r\nfury, must be in the City Hall of New York, and not on a racecourse in\r\nEngland, or in the Senate Chamber of Washington. The suggestion, of\r\ncourse, being that if the Tammany candidate were elected, its master would\r\nbe Richard Croker, who was supposed to spend his time on English race\r\ntracks, while if General Tracy were elected, he would take his orders from\r\nSenator Platt, the Republican Boss. Secondly, Mr. Low stood for the idea\r\nof Home Rule--Home Rule for New York. A community of three million and a\r\nquarter of people ought to be entitled to shape their own destinies in\r\nmatters that are purely local. Further, he stood as the advocate of good\r\ncity civic administration, which he defined as a civic government so well\r\nadministered that no interest in the great metropolis shall be so small as\r\nto be beneath its care, and no interest so great that it shall timidly\r\nshrink from attempting to deal with it. In Mr. Seth Low’s address,\r\naccepting the nomination, he frankly avowed that he was a Republican, and\r\nexpected to remain one; but he would pledge himself that, in making\r\nappointments, he would fill every place with an eye single to the public\r\ngood. “The patronage of the city shall not be used, so far as it is in the\r\nmayor’s power to prevent it, for purposes of either strengthening or\r\nweakening one party or another, or any fraction of another party.” On the\r\nsubject of public franchises, by which the streets of New York have been\r\npractically handed over to irresponsible corporations, he made the\r\nsignificant suggestion that the city should be able to deal with every\r\napplication for a change of the power by which the street railways were\r\nworked, as being equivalent to a demand for a new franchise. There is more\r\nin this than is discernible at first sight by an English reader. The\r\ntramways of New York are largely operated at present by cables and horses.\r\nThese are being superseded as rapidly as possible by electricity. If no\r\nstreet railway were to be allowed to adopt electricity as a mode of\r\ntraction, unless it surrendered what we should call its local Act of\r\nParliament, empowering it to use the streets, and had to make terms _de\r\nnovo_ for that privilege, the relation between the public and the\r\ncompanies would be immediately transformed. At present the companies have\r\ngot all they want, and pay the city next to nothing. It may not be\r\npossible to adopt Mr. Seth Low’s suggestion, but the idea is well worth\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nIn his reference to the Labour Laws of the City, he maintained that they\r\nshould be administered in the letter and in the spirit. The vexed question\r\nof the saloon was dealt with in a lengthy paragraph, in which he balanced\r\nhimself as best he could between the two schools of restriction and of\r\nfreedom. The Raines Liquor Law, which was imposed upon the City of New\r\nYork by the State Legislature, has created an immense amount of irritation\r\nby its attempt to secure Sunday closing, and to enforce stricter\r\ndiscipline on the saloons. Mr. Low condemned the Raines law for not taking\r\ninto account the public sentiment of so cosmopolitan a city as New York.\r\nThis being interpreted, means that the German citizens object to be\r\ndeprived of their Sunday beer, and that, to adopt the local vernacular,\r\nyou cannot swing a great world-city on principles of the hayseed\r\nlegislators up at Albany. What Mr. Low would do in relation to the\r\nlicensing does not precisely appear, beyond desiring to adopt some system\r\nof local option:--\r\n\r\n    In my opinion, an excise law, so far as it affects the daily life and\r\n    the habits of the people, should reflect the public opinion of the\r\n    city. On such points, in case of radical differences of opinion, I\r\n    should take the appeal to the people themselves.\r\n\r\nThe keynote, therefore, of his address lay in the sentence that he desired\r\nto secure for “this Imperial City” the opportunity to start upon its new\r\ncareer under an administration pledged to make the interests of the city\r\nits supreme care. Mr. Low had the great advantage of not being a mere\r\ntheorist, but one who had had four years’ experience in the application of\r\nthe principles upon which he would propose to act as Mayor of Greater New\r\nYork. The city government, he maintained, should be organised on business\r\nprinciples. Quite recently he contributed a chapter to Mr. Bryce’s\r\n“American Commonwealth” on City Government in the United States, in which\r\nhe embodied the result of his experience and observation as Mayor of\r\nBrooklyn. His dominant idea is that the government of a city should be\r\nconducted upon very much the same principles as the management of any\r\ncorporation, railroad, or joint stock company. The Mayor should be general\r\nmanager, and the head of every department should hold office at his\r\nsupreme discretion. Another principle upon which he insists is that\r\nwherever executive work is to be done, it must be put in the hands of one\r\nman, but that wherever it is not an affair for action, but for discretion,\r\nin the multitude of councillors there is wisdom. Where the work is\r\ndiscretionary have a board, where it is executive have one man.\r\n\r\nThe second candidate to enter the field was one as well known in this\r\ncountry as he is in his native land. Henry George, whose sudden death on\r\nthe eve of the poll gave so tragic a note to the contest, was nominated by\r\nthe Bryanite section of the Democratic party. He commanded, and deserved\r\nto command, a great deal of public support, and still more of popular\r\nsympathy. Henry George stood as candidate for Mayor some years since, and\r\nwas defeated by Tammany Hall joining hands with the Republicans, in order\r\nto elect Mr. Hewitt. Mr. Croker talked over that ancient history with me\r\non the steamer, and then expressed a confident conviction that the Labour\r\nUnions would never again support Henry George. They were all in line, he\r\nsaid, with Tammany. Henry George, whose book, “Progress and Poverty,” was\r\npractically discovered in Great Britain after it had fallen very flat in\r\nthe United States, was an honest man, full of all generous enthusiasms,\r\nand his candidature deserved and obtained general sympathy, because it was\r\nthe most emphatic, picturesque, and sensational method of expressing\r\ndissatisfaction with things as they are. Mr. George was a strong Free\r\nTrader, but he was not an advocate of Free Silver.\r\n\r\nHis followers, however, tolerated all differences of opinion in return for\r\nthe value of his support. They even left him to nominate his own ticket.\r\nHe was selected as candidate for a party calling itself the United\r\nDemocracy, which adopted the Liberty Bell as its emblem. The speaker who\r\nmoved the nomination of Mr. George in the Convention, spoke of him as “the\r\ngreat, the immortal Henry George, the man who had shown the working people\r\nthe way out of their difficulties. When George is mayor, the problems\r\nwhich vexed the municipality will cease. Corruption and bribery will keep\r\naway from the City Hall if George is there. They fear him as the\r\ninhabitants of the lower regions do the angels of heaven.” When he\r\naccepted the nomination, he declared that he stood not as a Silver\r\nDemocrat or a Gold Democrat, but as one who believed in the cardinal\r\nprinciples of Jeffersonian Democracy. The defeat of Bryan, he declared,\r\nwas “the defeat of everything for which our fathers had stood, and it\r\nlooked to him as though the United States were fast verging into a\r\nvirtual aristocracy and despotism.” He stood, therefore, upon the doctrine\r\nof the equality of men, and in the conviction that in the democracy that\r\nbelieved that all men were created equal lay the power that would vivify\r\nnot merely New York, but the world.\r\n\r\nThe platform of the United Democracy, after denouncing unscrupulous\r\ncorporations and corrupt combinations, whose influence is felt alike in\r\nlocal and national courts, proceeds to define the aims and aspirations of\r\nits supporters in a manifesto, of which the following is a summary:--\r\n\r\n    It reaffirms the Chicago platform, demands home rule in municipal\r\n    affairs, denounces the Excise laws, demands not only municipal\r\n    ownership of franchises but their operation by the municipal\r\n    government, three cent (or less) car fares on surface and “L” roads,\r\n    dollar gas, the abolition of contract work for the city, enforcement\r\n    of the eight-hour law on city work, the representation of labour in\r\n    the Administration, increase of school accommodation and the\r\n    introduction into the schools of industrial training: the designation\r\n    of public places for free exercise of the right of free speech, the\r\n    opening of court houses and schools for the free use of the people in\r\n    the evening: it denounces the abuse of injunctions by the courts, and\r\n    demands the abolition of property qualifications for grand and petit\r\n    jurors.\r\n\r\nThe clause in the plank of the Tammany platform which refers to the Raines\r\nLiquor Law ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n    We condemn the so-called “Raines” Liquor Law as iniquitous and\r\n    intolerant. It was passed at the instigation of the Republican State\r\n    machine against the protest of the majority of the people of New York,\r\n    irrespective of party. It has injured owners of real estate. It has\r\n    closed avenues of legitimate employment. It has deprived thousands of\r\n    our citizens of rational enjoyment. It has given rise to a system of\r\n    spying and official intermeddling abhorrent to a free people. It\r\n    extorts exorbitant revenues from this city to aggrandise other\r\n    portions of the State. It sought to deprive the citizen of a trial by\r\n    jury, and, in the collection of penalties, compels the licensee, at\r\n    the caprice of the State Commissioner of Excise, to defend himself in\r\n    remote localities. It protects and masks the dive-keeper, while it\r\n    harasses and impoverishes the reputable dealer. It promotes\r\n    intemperance, furnishes a legalised refuge for vice, imperils the\r\n    innocence of children, and destroys the sanctity of home. We therefore\r\n    demand its prompt repeal and the enactment of an Excise law,\r\n    conservative of the public morals and liberal in its provisions, that\r\n    shall place its administration and revenue, so far as shall apply to\r\n    this city, within the control of this municipality, thus insuring\r\n    strict enforcement of law by the consent of the governed.\r\n\r\nTammany is almost as pronounced as Henry George was as to the municipal\r\nownership. The following is the paragraph referring to this subject in\r\ntheir manifesto:--\r\n\r\n    All proper municipal functions should be exercised by the municipality\r\n    itself, and not delegated to others. We favour municipal ownership and\r\n    municipal control of all municipal franchises. We oppose the granting\r\n    of any public franchise in perpetuity. We oppose the granting or\r\n    extending of any such franchise, or the bestowal of any new privilege\r\n    upon a corporation holding such franchise, without adequate\r\n    compensation.\r\n\r\n    We, therefore, approve, as a step in the right direction, the\r\n    provisions of the new Charter, which require adequate compensation to\r\n    the city for all franchises hereafter to be granted, and which limit\r\n    the terms of all such franchises, with reversion to the city on their\r\n    expiration. We denounce the Republican party for its wasteful and\r\n    reckless grant of valuable public franchises to private individuals by\r\n    special legislation, with no provision for compensation to the\r\n    municipality, whereby this city has already lost some of the most\r\n    valuable franchises on its most important streets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LATE HENRY GEORGE.]\r\n\r\nThe most significant plank in the platform is that demanding municipal\r\nownership of monopolies of service as essential to the purification of\r\npolitics and the protection of the citizen against taxation:--\r\n\r\n    We declare that the functions of street railway transportation, the\r\n    lighting of the streets and homes of the people, whether by gas or\r\n    electricity, the carriage of the people by ferries about the waterways\r\n    of Greater New York, the facilitation of the interchange of speech by\r\n    telephones or telegraphs, are all purely municipal functions, things\r\n    which can better be done by organised society than by individuals; we\r\n    insist that the present system of delegating these functions to\r\n    corporations has resulted in a heavy sacrifice of public wealth and\r\n    convenience, the practice of extortion upon citizens compelled to\r\n    enlist the services of these corporations, and the creation of\r\n    powerful moneyed interests which, enjoying rich public grants,\r\n    systematically employ every art of corruption in politics to control\r\n    the city government for their own profit.\r\n\r\nMr. George declared he was a poor man as the candidate of poor men. Mr.\r\nGeorge simply stood where he did in 1886. Hence, he simply had to fall\r\nback upon his old thunder, and to reproduce the fierce denunciations which\r\nhe hurled against the existing state of things by which the control of the\r\nmodern American city was given over to the worst classes of the community.\r\nHere, for instance, is a passage in which he lashed the corrupt influences\r\nthat dominate American politics:--\r\n\r\n    The influences which have degraded the rich and debased the poor, and,\r\n    under the forms of Democracy, given over the metropolis of our country\r\n    to the rule of a class more unscrupulous and more arrogant than that\r\n    of the hereditary aristocracy from which it is our boast that we of\r\n    the new world have emancipated ourselves?\r\n\r\n    The type of modern growth is the great city. Here are to be found the\r\n    greatest wealth and the deepest poverty. And it is here that popular\r\n    government has most clearly broken down. In all the great American\r\n    cities there is to-day as clearly defined a ruling class as in the\r\n    most aristocratic countries of the world. Its members carry wards in\r\n    their pockets, make up slates for nominating conventions, distribute\r\n    offices as they bargain together, and--though they toil not, neither\r\n    do they spin--wear the best of raiment and spend money lavishly. They\r\n    are men of power, whose favour the ambitious must court, and whose\r\n    vengeance he must avoid.\r\n\r\n    Who are these men? The wise, the good, the learned--men who have\r\n    earned the confidence of their fellow citizens by the purity of their\r\n    lives, the splendour of their talents, their nobility in public\r\n    trusts, their deep study of the problems of government? No; they are\r\n    gamblers, saloon keepers, pugilists, or worse, who have made a trade\r\n    of controlling votes, and of buying and selling offices and official\r\n    acts.\r\n\r\n    It is through these men that rich corporations and powerful pecuniary\r\n    interests can pack the Senate and the Bench with their creatures. It\r\n    is these men who make school directors, supervisors, assessors,\r\n    members of the Legislature, Congressmen.\r\n\r\nMr. George was a magnetic man--a man of intense enthusiasm and tireless\r\nenergy. He spoke night after night, and as the contest waxed hotter and\r\nhotter his discourses rose in temperature, until, before the contest came\r\nto a close, he pledged himself to send Richard Croker to the Penitentiary\r\nas a thief; and he left his hearers in very little doubt that if he could\r\nhave had his way, the Republican boss would occupy the adjacent cell. To\r\nMr. Seth Low, Mr. George was a great speculative writer and a dreamer. To\r\nGeneral Tracy, he was a man who went in for Free License and Free\r\nEverything excepting Free Silver. To Tammany he was a most dangerous foe.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a speech delivered by Charles Frederick Adams\r\nis a fair illustration of the kind of ferment that is working under the\r\nsurface of American politics:--\r\n\r\n    Everywhere that man is oppressed by man the people are straining their\r\n    ears to hear of Henry George’s election. He is a man of men, one who\r\n    dues not confine his attention to the great individuals and the more\r\n    fortunate classes, but one who lends his head and heart to the cause\r\n    of man. He is the Moses to whom we all look to be led out of the\r\n    wilderness. He is the lodestar of suffering humanity.\r\n\r\n    This is no single tax movement. It is a movement to benefit\r\n    down-trodden man, a movement to throw off the chains of serfdom in\r\n    order that we may once again breathe God’s pure air with freedom.\r\n    Henry George has the respect of every intelligent man and woman in\r\n    this country. His name is the keynote to truth and freedom. And yet\r\n    there are men who claim to be his friend who went to him and asked him\r\n    not to accept a nomination for first Mayor of the Greater New York.\r\n    They appeal to his modesty, telling him that he is only wanted by a\r\n    handful of mere agitators. They know they lied when they tried to turn\r\n    him aside, and yet they call themselves his friend, but their\r\n    friendship is like a celebrated kiss in a celebrated garden.\r\n\r\n    It is not a question of silver, the tariff, or anything of that kind;\r\n    it is the more vital question of trying to rescue a great city from a\r\n    lot of organised robbers. As a guarantee of our sincerity we ask Henry\r\n    George to be our candidate and raise us from the contemptible tyranny\r\n    of little men. If we were held in thraldom by a Cæsar or a Napoleon we\r\n    might stand it, but, my God! a Croker, a Croker, gentlemen; a Croker\r\n    or a Platt!\r\n\r\n    The time has come when the common man, that great crucified of\r\n    eternity, shall say like the crucified divinity: “Choose ye now which\r\n    ye will serve; he that is not with me is against me,” and with these\r\n    words I ask you to take off your coats and work for the election of\r\n    Henry George.\r\n\r\nThe Tammany candidate, who was elected by a majority of 85,000 votes, was\r\nMr. Justice Van Wyck. Henry George stood 5 ft. 6 ins. in his shoes. Mr.\r\nVan Wyck stands 5 ft. 7 ins. Mr. Van Wyck is not yet fifty years of age.\r\nIn 1880 he distinguished himself by publicly denouncing Boss Kelly in\r\nTammany Hall for betraying John Hancock, the Democratic nominee for the\r\nPresidency. He was howled down, but he bided his time, and when Mr. Croker\r\nand Mr. Sheehan, the past and present Bosses of Tammany, put their heads\r\ntogether to find a man who is best calculated to carry the election, they\r\ndecided that there was none so good as Mr. Van Wyck. He is a clear\r\nspeaker, but he refused at this election to follow his opponents on to the\r\nplatform.\r\n\r\nTammany’s victories are not won by oratory. Tammany’s platform had many\r\nplanks, but three were prominent:--(1) The denunciation of Reform\r\nadministration, for raising the rates, and increasing the expenditure of\r\nthe city. (2) An attack upon the Streets Department, with Mr. Colles at\r\nits head. The ground for this attack was the irritation that was produced\r\nin Fifth Avenue and elsewhere by the Works Department permitting the\r\ndrainage and other works to be carried on so slowly as to practically\r\nrender the traffic in the thoroughfares impossible for twelve months at a\r\ntime. (3) An attack on the Raines Law as in every way an intolerant\r\nmeasure, which protected the evil, and persecuted the reputable. In this\r\nrespect Mr. Van Wyck was at one with Henry George. The two candidates also\r\nagreed in demanding Dollar Gas, a phrase which needs a moment’s\r\nexplanation. The gas companies which supply New York charge 5s. per\r\nthousand feet. It was proved before a Committee of the Legislature that\r\ngas can be sold at a profit at 4s. per thousand feet, but the influence of\r\nthe wealthy corporations was too great to permit such a heavy cut in their\r\ncharges. The price of gas, therefore, has to come down 2½d. a year for\r\nfive years, a postponement of the interests of the consumer to the greed\r\nof the gas companies which is bitterly resented in New York.\r\n\r\nLike Mr. Low and Mr. Henry George, Mr. Van Wyck was in favour of building\r\nfresh schools for the children, who are at present without school\r\naccommodation, and also in favour of more rapid transit and more bridges.\r\nOn municipal ownership he spoke with an uncertain sound, merely remarking\r\nthat the corporations now in the control of their streets have gone to\r\nsuch lengths as to require legislation and municipal oversight. By way of\r\nappealing to the labour party, he declared that the eight hour law on the\r\nStatute Book on the State was a righteous one, and must be maintained, and\r\nhe denounced government by injunction as a violation of the rights of man,\r\nstriking at time-honoured principles which are the foundation of the laws.\r\nEverything, he declared, was possible for an administration which would\r\nhave as its guiding thought the future rather than the present, prosperity\r\nrather than patronage, progress rather than politics. To be the first\r\nMayor of Greater New York seemed to him to be an opportunity of a\r\ngeneration. If he were elected, he declared that before the end of four\r\nyears there would be such progress as this hitherto divided city had never\r\nbefore enjoyed. Mr. Van Wyck is the Chief Justice of the City Court. His\r\nfather was a lawyer of Dutch extraction. It remains to be seen whether his\r\nconfident prognostication will be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nGeneral Tracy, the nominee of the Republican Convention, was too good a\r\nman to be sacrificed in such a fight. He has served the nation as\r\nSecretary for the Navy, and if common rumour be not a common liar, he did\r\na good deal of the work of Secretary of State in the last years of Mr.\r\nBlaine. England owes him a special meed of gratitude, because it was he\r\nwho, when he was in supreme control of the American Navy, insisted upon\r\nbreaking through all rules and precedents in order to allow Captain Mahan\r\nto continue at a post on land, where he had leisure to finish his great\r\nwork on “Sea Power in History.” General Tracy is also too old a man to be\r\nintrusted with the onerous task of governing this great heterogeneous\r\nconglomerate of cities which is known as Greater New York. He is nearly\r\nsixty-eight years of age, and, although he is hale and hearty, he will be\r\nover three score and ten by the time the first Mayor of the Greater New\r\nYork has to retire from office. His nomination was due to the fixed\r\ndetermination of his partner’s father, Mr. Senator Platt, the Republican\r\nmachine man, to assert himself at this election. In his eyes the Citizens’\r\nUnion is an arrogant upstart, a mutinous offshoot, which has the audacity\r\nto deny to the regular Republican machine its legitimate voice in the\r\ncontrol of affairs in New York. Mr. Platt and Mr. Croker agree in\r\nbelieving that it is impossible to govern New York without a regular party\r\nmachine. The Citizens’ Union, of course, would in time become a party\r\nmachine, but as it starts on non-partisan lines, the process of evolving a\r\nBoss from the Citizens’ Union would be slower than would be the case of\r\nother organisations based upon regular party lines. In order to secure a\r\nplatform for General Tracy, the Republican Party men had to repudiate the\r\nprogramme for which they had repeatedly committed themselves in times\r\npast. The separation of municipal from national issues had been repeatedly\r\naffirmed in the strongest terms by previous Republican conventions; but on\r\nthis occasion, in order to justify General Tracy’s candidature, the\r\nRepublican platform was throughout an attempt to introduce the national\r\nissues into the city contest. The one great issue before the people, it\r\ndeclared, was the Chicago platform, an admission of which Mr. Bryan after\r\nthe victory has naturally made the most.\r\n\r\nBryanism was confounded with Tammany Hall, and it was asserted in the\r\nstrongest possible terms that “the code of good government, meaning\r\nthereby honest and intelligent administration, can never be divorced from\r\nthe Republican party.” “We are the people, and wisdom will die with us,”\r\nand not wisdom only, but honesty, ability, righteousness and all manner of\r\nvirtue will only perish from the land unless the regular Republican\r\ncandidate is put into office and kept there. That is always the burden of\r\ntheir song. General Tracy appealed to the citizens as the candidate of\r\nsound money, which has absolutely nothing to do with any municipal\r\nissue--the candidate of social order and the endorser of the patriotic and\r\nsuccessful administration of William McKinley. Forgetful of the fact that\r\nthey had declared they would prefer to see a Tammany mayor elected than\r\nthe candidate of the Citizens’ Union, the Republicans denounced Tammany in\r\nno measured terms. “The crimes of the Tammany democracy should never be\r\nforgotten or forgiven.” The platform then commends the Raines law on the\r\nground that by removing power from the excise or local license board, and\r\nconceding the right to sell intoxicating liquors to any citizen who paid\r\nthe tax and obeyed the law, it had taken the saloon out of politics, and\r\nhad liberated the saloon-keeper from the politician. It had also been\r\nfinancially advantageous. But having endorsed the Raines Law up to this\r\npoint, they hedged in the final paragraph, in which, after referring to\r\nthe cosmopolitan character of the city, they said that “provisions of the\r\nlaw relating to the times and conditions at and under which liquor may be\r\nsold, and the provisions of the law enforced, are wisely to be left to the\r\nwill of the people of the city rather than to the judgment of their duly\r\nconstituted authorities.”\r\n\r\nFinally, the platform pledged the party to a strict enforcement of the\r\nlabour laws, which were defined as follows:--“The Factory Inspection Law,\r\nthe Mechanics Lien Law, the Law Regulating the Employment of Minors in\r\nMercantile Establishments, the Anti-Sweating Law, the Law Guaranteeing\r\nUnion Wages on all Public Works, and the Law Preventing the Subletting of\r\nContracts.” General Tracy in accepting the nomination declared that it was\r\nnot enough for the Mayor to be negatively honest. “He must be\r\naffirmatively and aggressively honest.” But he also harped upon the\r\nspectre of Bryanism, which would not down, and invoked for the exorcising\r\nof that spectre “the Republican Party, which in the Providence of God, for\r\nmore than forty years, has been the great bulwark of national honour and\r\nprosperity.” Any attempt to disintegrate, weaken or destroy that\r\norganisation seemed to him a grievous mistake, fraught with calamity and\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nOn September 27th the _Journal_ sent out an army of reporters, with\r\ninstructions to interview all the citizens whom they met in the course of\r\nthe day in certain well-defined districts, in order to ascertain their\r\npreference as between General Tracy and Seth Low. The voters were\r\napproached indiscriminately, and represented all sorts and conditions of\r\nmen, from hod-carriers to bankers. The result was that 9,102 citizens were\r\ninterviewed, 4,835 of whom preferred Seth Low, and 4,267 voted for Tracy.\r\nThis poll suggested the holding of a much more comprehensive census of\r\nopinion. An attempt was made to interrogate a whole vast constituency.\r\nThree hundred reporters were sent out with the following ticket:--\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                    _NEW YORK JOURNAL._                    |\r\n  |                                                           |\r\n  |       VAN WYCK.

Never before had there been so\r\nextended a canvass introduced of what they call a straw ballot in any\r\nconstituency. It was, of course, not a ballot in the sense of secret\r\nvoting at all, for all the citizens signed their papers, which were then\r\ntaken to the central office and carefully examined. The census began on\r\nthe 4th of October and was continued for a week. It was closed with the\r\nfollowing result:--\r\n\r\n    Each elector was required to sign his name and address upon a voting\r\n    card supplied by the canvasser. When the poll was closed the _Journal_\r\n    had obtained signed declarations from no fewer than 277,871. The\r\n    voting was divided as follows:--\r\n\r\n                         Total _Journal_ Poll.\r\n\r\n        Van Wyck               89,056\r\n        George                 85,050\r\n        Low                    59,764\r\n        Tracy                  44,001\r\n                              -------\r\n             Total            277,871\r\n\r\n    These figures show that Mr. Van Wyck had 32 per cent. of the\r\n    constituency, Henry George 30½, Low 21½ and Tracy nearly 16. If on the\r\n    2nd of November the whole 550,000 electors had gone to the poll, and\r\n    those who have not been reached by the canvassers had voted in the\r\n    same proportion as those who have, the result would have worked out as\r\n    follows:--\r\n\r\n                                Position in\r\n                             Greater New York.      Actual Vote.\r\n\r\n        Van Wyck                 176,269       |      235,181\r\n        George                   168,345       |       20,727\r\n        Low                      118,288       |      149,873\r\n        Tracy                     87,098       |      101,823\r\n                                 -------       |      -------\r\n             Total               550,000       |      507,604\r\n\r\nAll calculations, however, were vitiated by the death of Henry George. His\r\nson, whose name was substituted for his father’s at the eleventh hour,\r\nnaturally could not command the same amount of support.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From _Puck_. GREATER NEW YORK: AN OPTIMISTIC VIEW OF THE\r\nFUTURE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST MAYOR OF GREATER NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n    Edgar A. Whitney, examined by Chairman Lexow: I was in the\r\n    gaming-house when the door opened, and Mr. Glennon, the police\r\n    wardman, gave the word and said, “Is Mr. Pease in?” I said, “No, sir;\r\n    I am taking care of the game while he is at his supper.” He said,\r\n    “Come to one side:” he said, “That captain wants this game closed up\r\n    until after election time; that if the Tammany Hall ticket is\r\n    elected,” he says, “we will protect you for anything from a poker game\r\n    to a whore-house.”--Report of Lexow Commission, vol. ii., p. 1603.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above extract from the evidence taken before the Lexow Committee at\r\nthe end of 1894, immediately after the election which overturned Tammany\r\nrule in New York City, condenses into one coarse but expressive sentence\r\nthe moral issue usually raised by elections in New York. Whether the\r\nlatest victory of Tammany will have the same result remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe election of Mr. Van Wyck, the Tammany candidate, as the first Mayor of\r\nGreater New York, which has taken place as these pages were passing\r\nthrough the press, is a curious and suggestive comment upon “Satan’s\r\nInvisible World Displayed.”\r\n\r\n“Ephraim is joined to his idols, let him alone!” has been the reflection\r\nof many a reformer on hearing of the immense majority by which the second\r\ncity in the world elected to place itself under the governance of the\r\nelect of Tammany Hall. But the worst of such an attitude is that Ephraim\r\ndoes not leave other people alone, for in his worship of the false gods he\r\nbrings down disasters upon other heads than his own. The welfare and good\r\ngovernment of the first city in America can never be a matter of\r\nindifference to the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nTammany Hall seated its candidate by a majority of votes sufficiently\r\ndecisive. But although Mr. Van Wyck was 85,000 votes ahead of his nearest\r\ncompetitor, he did not poll a majority of the citizens. If the principle\r\nof a second ballot which is established on the Continent of Europe had\r\nbeen the law in New York, the issue would have had to be fought out again\r\nin a single-handed fight between Mr. Van Wyck and Mr. Seth Low. In default\r\nof such a provision, all that can be said is that at the first election of\r\nGreater New York Tammany polled 235,000 and the three anti-Tammany\r\ncandidates 272,000 votes, making a majority against Tammany of 37,000.\r\n\r\nIf Tammany be as black as it is painted, the worst thing about the\r\nelection is not the return of Mr. Van Wyck, but the divisions of his\r\nopponents. That Tammany should be beloved of her own progeny is nothing.\r\nWhat is serious is that those children of light who see the evil of\r\nTammany rule should treat it as a matter of trivial importance compared\r\nwith the passion and prejudice of personalities and parties. If good men\r\ndo not combine when bad men conspire, the inference is very obvious.\r\nEither the conspiracy of the bad men is not very bad, or the good men\r\nhardly deserve their name.\r\n\r\nThe familiar saying of Burke that he refused to draw an indictment against\r\na whole nation may be applied to cities as well as to nations. What is\r\nclear enough is that Tammany in the past has discredited democracy. It has\r\ndone so twice in the most conspicuous and unmistakable fashion.\r\n\r\nUnder Tweed it became a synonym for Thieving. Under Croker’s government\r\nthe Lexow Report proved it became an organised system of Blackmail.\r\n\r\nWhat is it to be under Mr. Van Wyck?\r\n\r\nThat is the question which it is for Tammany to decide.\r\n\r\nMr. Croker professed admirable sentiments as to his resolution to make New\r\nYork the ideal city of the world. Nothing could have been worthy of the\r\nman to whom the citizens have entrusted their destiny. We should, however,\r\nhave had more right to face the future with confidence had Mr. Croker’s\r\ncontemplation of the past--and such a past--not been quite so complacent.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it is a good rule that which Cardinal Manning laid down for\r\ndealing with those who protest that they have been cruelly misjudged by\r\ntheir contemporaries.\r\n\r\n“When a man tells me that he is an honest man,” said the great Cardinal,\r\n“I never enter into a controversy with him as to the past. The past is\r\npast. And although I may have in my hand conclusive proofs of his guilt, I\r\nnever refer to the subject. I always say, ‘My friend, you say that you are\r\nan honest man. I am delighted to hear it. We will not discuss the past. We\r\nmight be unable to agree on that subject. But the future is before us. Act\r\nas an honest man from henceforth, and I shall treat you as an honest\r\nman.’”\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal’s rule may be invoked in favour of extending the same act of\r\noblivion to Tammany and its Chief.\r\n\r\nThe account of past misrule placed on record in the Report of the Lexow\r\nCommittee cannot be effaced from the page of history.\r\n\r\nIt is a useful and timely service to Tammany itself to popularise the\r\nfindings of that Committee, if only to remind the men, who are now\r\nsummoned to make New York the ideal city of the world, of the hole from\r\nwhich they were digged. A vivid remembrance of the horrible pit and the\r\nmiry clay has ever been regarded as salutary for the pilgrim to the\r\nCelestial City.\r\n\r\nNothing is more likely to help Mr. Croker and his men to try to obey the\r\nApostolic maxim to forget the things that are behind in order to press\r\nforward to those which are before, than the knowledge that every one can\r\ngive chapter and verse in support of their belief that New York under\r\nTammany rule in the past really deserved the title of “Satan’s Invisible\r\nWorld.”\r\n\r\nOn that point there is no longer any room for difference of opinion. To\r\nquestion it is to justify disbelief in the honesty of the sceptic or the\r\nsincerity of his professions as a Reformer. But we may well be content to\r\nlet the dead past bury its dead if, rising upon the wreck and ruin of\r\nthese evil days, Tammany should now attain to nobler things.\r\n\r\nThere is at least one great historical precedent justifying a hope that\r\nthis may be so.\r\n\r\nWhen Madcap Hal succeeded to the English throne, there was the same\r\njubilant exultation among Falstaff, Bardolph and all the roystering crew\r\nwhen Pistol rushed in helter-skelter, crying:--\r\n\r\n  And tidings do I bring, and lucky joys,\r\n  And golden times, and happy news of price.\r\n\r\nBut the story of their disappointment is one of the most familiar and\r\ndramatic scenes in the history of the English-speaking race. The question\r\nnow is whether Mr. Croker will dare to address his old companions of\r\nmisrule in the words of Henry the Fifth:--\r\n\r\n  Presume not that I am the thing I was:\r\n  For Heaven doth know, so shall the world perceive,\r\n  That I have turn’d away my former self;\r\n  So will I those that kept me company.\r\n\r\nIf so we may hope that it may be in New York even as it was in olden time\r\nin England, and that it may be said of the era that opened when Tammany\r\nelected the first Mayor of Greater New York by 85,000 majority:--\r\n\r\n              Yea, at that very moment,\r\n  Consideration like an angel came,\r\n  And whipp’d the offending Adam out of him.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Never came reformation in a flood,\r\n  With such a heady current scouring faults;\r\n  Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness\r\n  So soon did lose his seat, and all at once,\r\n  As in this King.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nMAYOR VAN WYCK’S PROGRAMME.\r\n\r\n\r\nMayor Van Wyck’s Letter of Acceptance in reply to the Democratic City\r\nConvention, which invited him to stand as candidate for the Mayoralty, was\r\npublished a fortnight before the polling day. In the _New York Journal_ of\r\nOctober 24th, Mr. Van Wyck, in the course of an interview with Alfred\r\nHenry Lewis, a representative of the paper, said:--“There need be no doubt\r\nor mistiness concerning my attitude on all questions now craving reply. I\r\nwish most heartily that every citizen of New York would read my letter of\r\nacceptance. It was not carelessly prepared; it was in no sort the\r\nsuggestion or work of other men; it presents my exact position on every\r\nsubject it suggests, and I meant every phrase of it, and I mean it now.”\r\n\r\nThe text of the Letter of Acceptance is as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Hon. Almet F. Jenks, chairman; John C. Sheehan, Bernard J. York, Dr.\r\n    John L. Feeney, James McCartney and John H. Sutphen, committee.\r\n\r\n    Gentlemen: In response to your official notification of the action of\r\n    the Democratic City Convention in selecting me as its candidate for\r\n    the office of Mayor of Greater New York, I now formally accept the\r\n    nomination.\r\n\r\n    The duty before the first Mayor of the City of New York, as it is to\r\n    be the beginning of the coming year, is of a magnitude too vast to be\r\n    undertaken without misgivings by any man of mind enough to comprehend\r\n    the problems it involves. While it is to be the second city in the\r\n    world in population, it is to be, at the very outset, the first--by\r\n    far the first--in point of the strictly municipal powers to be\r\n    exercised by its local government.\r\n\r\n    To approach the task in any other spirit than that of American\r\n    liberty, coupled with a realising sense of the cosmopolitan character\r\n    of the population to be served, would, in my judgment, be to err\r\n    fundamentally.\r\n\r\n    The temper of mind which benefits the villager or the inhabitant of\r\n    towns in which there is but one type of citizenship to deal with is\r\n    little fitted for the work before us.\r\n\r\n    At all events, should the people repose their confidence in me, I will\r\n    endeavour to act with that largeness of view which considers the\r\n    rights of every man, regardless of race, creed or colour.\r\n\r\n    A successful administration of the affairs of this municipality must\r\n    depend, in great measure, upon the honesty and the efficiency of the\r\n    officials appointed by the Mayor. In this regard I shall, if elected,\r\n    exercise the greatest care to provide, in all the departments, for\r\n    such intelligent and honest supervision and direction as will secure\r\n    to the public not only a wise and efficient service, but as well the\r\n    return to them of a dollar’s worth for every dollar expended.\r\n\r\n    To make of the several boroughs a homogeneous city requires that, in\r\n    the control of the administration of affairs, there should be a\r\n    government responsible and responsive to the people. It should be\r\n    honest, efficient and liberal. It should be guided by sound political\r\n    principles, securing a more perfect discharge of public duty than is\r\n    possible under such conditions as have imposed upon us the factious,\r\n    discordant and demoralising administration from the misdeeds and\r\n    negligences of which all elements of our citizenship have suffered.\r\n\r\n    What is here said of the present city of New York applies, I am\r\n    persuaded, in considerable measure, to Brooklyn. There, also, the\r\n    taxpayer has had reason for serious complaint. Within the past four\r\n    years taxes have been heavily increased, the cost of most of the\r\n    departments has been largely augmented, and the debt has not only been\r\n    carried up to the Constitutional limit, but has been positively\r\n    swollen to the extent of over ten millions of dollars.\r\n\r\n    To permit a continuance of the disregard thus shown for the ability of\r\n    property to contribute to the support of the government would\r\n    obviously be to give to confiscation a practical sanction. The\r\n    metropolis is not to be made prosperous by any policy which involves\r\n    the ruin of the investors in its real estate.\r\n\r\n    The results here exhibited furnish one of the most costly object\r\n    lessons ever taught a community as to the wasteful character of a\r\n    Government permitted to whirl incoherently with the whims of its\r\n    several officials, as contrasted with the economy enforced by the\r\n    organised vigilance and definite policy of responsible Government\r\n    controlling all the expenditures of its subordinate departments.\r\n\r\n    Coupled with the extravagance and waste against which our citizens\r\n    have protested, there has been an utter disregard of the rights and\r\n    convenience of the people; the most scandalous example of which is to\r\n    be found in the present shocking condition of our streets and\r\n    thoroughfares.\r\n\r\n    There can be no justification for such a complete surrender of our\r\n    road-beds to corporations and contractors. Undoubtedly the prosecution\r\n    of necessary and useful improvements requires an occasional\r\n    disturbance of some part of the pavements of our streets, and\r\n    sometimes a partial interference with the movements of traffic. It\r\n    needs, however, but ordinary care and supervision in the consideration\r\n    of demands made in this direction to so arrange that no single\r\n    locality may be unduly disturbed, and that all the discomforts and\r\n    inconveniences of the situation shall not fall upon the citizen to the\r\n    profit and advantage of the contractor.\r\n\r\n    While a proper opportunity must always be given for the prosecution of\r\n    public work, and while no unnecessary delays should be permitted in\r\n    its completion, this does not mean that entire streets and avenues are\r\n    to be delivered over to the exclusive use of public and private\r\n    contractors; that for miles the stores and shops in the most prominent\r\n    of our thoroughfares are to be practically shut out from business;\r\n    that our citizens are to be denied any but the most difficult access\r\n    to their homes; that in some cases traffic between the various points\r\n    of our city be made impossible, and in all cases difficult and\r\n    dangerous, and that the health of the entire community should be\r\n    imperilled and injuriously affected by open trenches, wherever the\r\n    people may turn.\r\n\r\n    Such a condition of the streets as we are now compelled to endure may\r\n    result from gross inefficiency. It can be attributed to only one other\r\n    cause, and that is, gross corruption. It should be treated as a\r\n    criminal disregard of the public comfort and safety, and any\r\n    administration responsible therefor must stand discredited before the\r\n    community.\r\n\r\n    The flagrant violations of the principles of Home Rule by the\r\n    Republican majorities in recent Legislatures have challenged the\r\n    attention and excited the indignation of our citizens. The usurpation\r\n    of the rights of our municipality and its people has become such an\r\n    intolerable wrong that it cannot be too strongly rebuked. A\r\n    cosmopolitan constituency, exceeding the population of the United\r\n    States at the time of the adoption of the federal Constitution, should\r\n    not be required to protest against such interference with its purely\r\n    domestic concerns as attempts to dictate even its harmless customs,\r\n    habits and pursuits.\r\n\r\n    And yet, again and again we have been subject to legislation conceived\r\n    either in ignorance of, or contempt for, the wishes and sentiments of\r\n    our people, and enacted as a revenge upon our politics or an assault\r\n    upon our revenues.\r\n\r\n    In the Raines Liquor Law we have an example of a class of legislation\r\n    utterly without public sanction. It was imposed upon our citizens\r\n    against their vigorous and united protest. It has failed to secure a\r\n    single one of the advantages urged in justification of its enactment.\r\n    It has only succeeded, by dispensing with local supervision and\r\n    control, in removing the salutary restraints which heretofore\r\n    protected the reputable dealer from the open rivalry of the\r\n    divekeeper. It employs the spy, and necessitates methods which can\r\n    never be approved by men who believe in the Democratic theory of\r\n    government. I favour its prompt repeal.\r\n\r\n    I join in the demand of your platform for “the enactment of an excise\r\n    law conservative of the public morals and liberal in its provisions,\r\n    that shall place its administration and revenues, so far as shall\r\n    apply to this city, within the control of this municipality.”\r\n\r\n    With you, I believe that one of the chief duties of the incoming\r\n    administration will be to provide adequate school accommodation. I\r\n    recognise the obstacles in the way. It is difficult to keep pace with\r\n    the changes which affect the residence or business character of\r\n    localities. It is not with the intention of reproaching any one for\r\n    the condition of affairs in this direction in the past, but simply to\r\n    emphasise a determination for the future, that I express my full\r\n    indorsement of your demand that every child desirous of education in\r\n    our schools shall be afforded full opportunity, whatever labour or\r\n    expense may thereby be involved.\r\n\r\n    In common with all citizens, I recognise that, to make effectual the\r\n    advantages which all expect to flow from the consolidation of the\r\n    various boroughs, there must at once be devised and put in execution a\r\n    system of rapid transit which will afford quick and comfortable travel\r\n    between the homes and places of business of our people in the boroughs\r\n    of Manhattan and of the Bronx; bridges facilitating communication\r\n    between the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens with Manhattan Island, and\r\n    the expansion of the ferry system, at reduced fares, between the\r\n    borough of Richmond and the rest of the city.\r\n\r\n    In your platform there is, I am pleased to see, a comprehensive\r\n    appreciation shown of the directions in which the general well being,\r\n    not less than the material interests, of the people ought to be\r\n    promoted by the administration. It is there felicitously\r\n    said:--“Subject to the limitations of reasonable, but not parsimonious\r\n    expenditure, the municipality should provide all needed facilities for\r\n    the open-air recreation of the people. Good roads, bicycle paths,\r\n    improved pavements, open-air playgrounds, small parks and pier gardens\r\n    are improvements in this direction.” I deem it proper to make special\r\n    mention in this relation of the pressing necessity for proper bicycle\r\n    paths, and to add that, if elected, I shall make it my duty to have\r\n    them constructed.\r\n\r\n    The demand made in the platform for dollar gas, used both as fuel and\r\n    light, also commends itself to my judgment.\r\n\r\n    The proper limits of a letter of acceptance will not permit an\r\n    adequate presentation of the importance to the commercial supremacy of\r\n    the city of having its water front improved to the uttermost. The\r\n    endeavour of other cities to wrest from us the position to which we\r\n    are entitled by reason of the natural advantages which we enjoy, and\r\n    the enterprise of our merchants, should awaken a vigilance which will\r\n    furnish us with dock accommodations sufficient for our largest\r\n    commercial needs.\r\n\r\n    I heartily approve and indorse every pledge of the platform of\r\n    principles adopted at the Convention. The great essential for\r\n    municipal progress is home rule in the management of local concerns.\r\n    Almost as a necessary consequence will we then enjoy that measure of\r\n    personal liberty which imposes and permits only such restraint of the\r\n    citizen as is necessary for the peace and protection of all.\r\n\r\n    All lawful combinations which deny to any or all of our citizens a\r\n    free field of competition must be suppressed. The municipality itself\r\n    should both own and control its franchises, and where now such\r\n    franchises are operated under grants to corporations, a fair charge,\r\n    and that only, for the service rendered or convenience furnished\r\n    should be permitted.\r\n\r\n    In the prosecution of public improvements a liberal, but not\r\n    extravagant, policy, as already remarked, should be adopted. The needs\r\n    and claims of the various boroughs should be carefully considered and\r\n    fairly determined.\r\n\r\n    The eight hour law should be enforced, and, where practicable,\r\n    resident labour should be directly employed. In all cases the\r\n    prevailing rate of wages should be paid. As I understand the\r\n    declaration of your platform upon this point, it means that every\r\n    contractor doing work for the city should be required to pay as high a\r\n    rate of wages as the city itself is required to pay for similar work.\r\n    To this I give my unqualified assent.\r\n\r\n    Let me add, in conclusion, that, should the people intrust me with the\r\n    grave responsibility of the Mayoralty, I shall make the promotion of\r\n    their welfare, to the exclusion of all antagonistic ends, the object\r\n    to be striven for with every power of my mind and body.--Yours\r\n    respectfully,\r\n\r\n      ROBERT A.
