H.,\" published in\r\n1851, in Horace Greeley's \"American Conflict,\" and in Henry Wilson's\r\n\"History of the Rise and Fall of the Slave Power.\"\r\n\r\nNeeded information has been furnished by those intimately connected\r\nwith Mr. CHANDLER, but the work has not been submitted to their\r\nrevision, and they are not responsible for the form of the narrative,\r\nnor for the personal estimate it embodies.\r\n\r\nThis book presents a sketch of the life and the public services of a\r\nremarkable man. It has been written from the standpoint of political\r\nsympathy, and with the hope of deepening the wholesome influences so\r\npowerfully exerted upon public sentiment in his lifetime by ZACHARIAH\r\nCHANDLER. The aim has been to make it accurate in statement, and to see\r\nthat its chapters should fairly draw, in outline at least, the picture\r\nof the career of a genuine leader of men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO THE EDITORS OF THE POST AND TRIBUNE:\r\n\r\nI am unable to give any personal or special incidents in the life of\r\nMr. Chandler not open to his biographers from other sources. I was not\r\nso intimate in my relations with him as were some others, nor did I\r\nknow him better than many others who like myself were associated with\r\nhim in public life for a long period. I knew him well, however, both on\r\nthe side of his private life and his public life, and in every phase he\r\nwas a man of strong character.\r\n\r\nThe time in which a man lives, and the circumstances by which he is\r\nsurrounded, control his fate even more largely than his personal and\r\ninherent qualities. Mr. Chandler was fortunate in the time of his\r\nremoval to the West, fortunate in the era which brought him into\r\npublic life. When he became a citizen of Michigan the days of hard\r\npioneer life were ending, extensive cultivation of the soil had begun,\r\nproducts for shipment were large and rapidly increasing. Facilities\r\nfor transportation were already great. The Erie Canal had been open\r\nfor several years, and steamers had multiplied on the Great Lakes.\r\nEverything was in readiness for a strong-minded, energetic, competent\r\nman of business, and Mr. Chandler had the good fortune to settle in\r\nDetroit at the precise point of time when the elements of success were\r\nwithin his grasp. For a quarter of a century thereafter his career was\r\nthat of a business man intensely devoted to his private interests,\r\nand participating in public affairs only as an incident and with no\r\neffort to secure advancement. The result of this steady devotion to\r\nbusiness was that Mr. Chandler found himself at forty-four years of age\r\npossessed of a large property, constantly and rapidly increasing in\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nCoincident with this condition in his financial fortunes came a\r\ncrisis in the political affairs of the country, involving the class\r\nof questions which took deep hold on the mind and the heart of Mr.\r\nChandler. The curbing of the slave power, the assertion and maintenance\r\nof freedom on free soil, undying devotion to the Union of the States,\r\nand the bold defense of the rights of the citizen--these were the\r\nissues which in various phases absorbed the public mind from the repeal\r\nof the Missouri compromise in 1854 down to the close of Mr. Chandler's\r\nlife. And on all the issues presented for consideration for twenty-five\r\nyears Mr. Chandler never halted, never wearied, never grew timid, never\r\nwas willing to compromise. On these great questions he became the\r\nleader of Michigan, and Michigan kept Mr. Chandler at the front during\r\nthe prolonged struggle which has wrought such mighty changes in the\r\nhistory of the American people.\r\n\r\nIt is a noteworthy fact, not infrequently adverted to, that the\r\npolitical opinions of Michigan both as Territory and State, for a\r\nperiod of sixty years, were represented, and indeed in no small degree\r\nformed, by two men of New Hampshire birth. From 1819 to 1854 General\r\nCass was the accepted political leader of Michigan, and only once\r\nin all that long period of thirty-five years did her people fail to\r\nfollow him. That was in 1840, when the old pioneers and the soldiers of\r\n1812--generally the friends of Cass--refused his leadership, and voted\r\nfor the older pioneer and the more illustrious chieftain, William Henry\r\nHarrison. From 1854 till Mr. Chandler's death the dominant opinion\r\nof Michigan was with him; and her people followed him, trusted him,\r\nbelieved in him. During that quarter of a century the population of the\r\nState more than trebled in number, but the strength of Chandler with\r\nthe newcomers seemed as great as with the older population with whom\r\nhe had begun the struggle of life in the Territory of Michigan. The\r\nold men stood firmly by him in the faith and confidence of an ancient\r\nfriendship, and the young men followed with an enthusiasm which grew\r\ninto affection, and with an affection which ripened into reverence.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler's life in Washington, apart from his public service, was\r\na notable event in the history of the capital. His wealth enabled him\r\nto be generous and hospitable, and his elegant mansion was a center of\r\nattraction for many years. Nor were the guests confined to one party.\r\nMr. Chandler was personally popular with his political opponents,\r\nand the leading men of the Democratic party often sat at his table\r\nand forgot in the genial host, and the frank, sincere man, all the\r\nbitterness that might have come from conflict in the partisan arena.\r\n\r\nIt is fitting that Mr. Chandler's life be written. It is due, first of\r\nall, to his memory. It is due to those who come after him. It is due\r\nto the great State whose Senator he was, whose interests he served,\r\nwhose honor he upheld. I am glad the work is committed to competent\r\nfriends, who can discriminate between honest approval and inconsiderate\r\npraise, and who with strict adherence to truth can find in his career\r\nso much that is honorable, so much that is admirable, so little that is\r\ncensurable, and nothing that is mean.\r\n\r\n                           Very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                                         JAMES G.

It is a community of thrifty\r\nfarms, with striking characteristics, and almost a century and a half\r\nof entertaining history. Simplicity of manners and sturdiness of\r\ncharacter prevail among its people to-day, and the vigor of the stock\r\nof its original settlers, the loftiness of their traditions, and the\r\npuritanism of its civilization have made it a nursery of strong men.\r\n\r\nKing Philip's War ended in a Pyrrhic victory for the New England\r\nprovinces. The subjugation of the savages was only accomplished when\r\none in twenty of the men among the colonists had fallen and a like\r\nproportion of their families was houseless, and it left behind it what\r\nwas in those days a heavy debt. More than half a century elapsed before\r\nthere was any substantial recognition of the claims of the survivors of\r\nthat war and their descendants. It was not until 1732, after numerous\r\npetitions and prolonged discussion, that \"the Great and General Court\r\nof Massachusetts\" granted land enough for two townships \"to the\r\nsoldiers who had served in King Philip's or the Narragansett War and to\r\ntheir surviving heirs-at-law.\" This grant was subsequently enlarged to\r\nseven townships, as appears from the following record of proceedings in\r\n\"the Great and General Court or Assembly for His Majestie's Province of\r\nthe Massachusetts Bay,\" under date of April 26, 1733:\r\n\r\n  A Petition of a Committee for the Narragansett Soldiers, showing\r\n  that there are the number of Eight Hundred and Forty Persons\r\n  entered as officers and soldiers in the late Narragansett War,\r\n  Praying that there may be such an addition of Land granted to them,\r\n  as may allow a Tract of six miles Square to each one hundred and\r\n  twenty men so admitted.\r\n\r\n  In the House of Representatives, Read, and Ordered that the Prayer\r\n  of the Petition be granted, and that Major Chandler, Mr. Edward\r\n  Shove, Col. Thomas Tileston, Mr. John Hobson and Mr. Samuel\r\n  Chandler (or any three of them,) be a Committee fully authorized\r\n  and empowered to survey and lay out five more Tracts of Land for\r\n  Townships, of the Contents of Six miles Square each, in some of\r\n  the unappropriated lands of this Province; and that the said land,\r\n  together with the two towns before granted, be granted and disposed\r\n  of to the officers and soldiers or their lawful Representatives, as\r\n  they are or have been allowed by this Court, being eight hundred\r\n  and forty in number, in the whole, and in full satisfaction of the\r\n  Grant formerly made them by the General Court, as a reward for\r\n  their public service. And the Grantees shall be obliged to assemble\r\n  within as short time as they can conveniently, not exceeding the\r\n  space of two months, and proceed to the choice of Committees,\r\n  respectively, to regulate each Propriety or Township which is to\r\n  be held and enjoyed by one hundred and twenty of the Grantees,\r\n  each in equal Proportion, who shall pass such orders and rules as\r\n  will effectually oblige them to settle Sixty families, at least,\r\n  within each Township, with a learned, orthodox ministry, within the\r\n  space of seven years of the date of this Grant. Provided, always,\r\n  that if the said Grantees shall not effectually settle the said\r\n  number of families in each Township, and also lay out a lot for\r\n  the first settled minister, one for the ministry, and one for the\r\n  school, in each of the said townships, they shall have no advantage\r\n  of, but forfeit their respective grants, anything to the contrary\r\n  contained notwithstanding. The Charge of the Survey to be paid by\r\n  the Province.\r\n\r\n  In Council read and concur'd.\r\n\r\n                                                             J. BELCHER.\r\n\r\nIn June of 1733 these grantees met on Boston Common for the purpose of\r\nmaking a division of the lands thus appropriated, but twenty veterans\r\nof the Narragansett War being then living. They organized into seven\r\nsocieties, each representing one hundred and twenty persons, and each\r\nrepresented by an executive committee of three. These committees\r\nconvened in Boston on the 17th of October, 1733, and, by drawing\r\nnumbers from a hat, apportioned to their societies the following\r\nseven townships set apart from the public domain under the grant:\r\nNo. 1, in Maine, now called Buxton; No. 2, Westminster, Mass.; No.\r\n3, Souhegan-West, now Amherst, N. H.; No. 4, originally at the Falls\r\nof the Amoskeag, where Goffstown now is (subsequently exchanged for\r\nlands in Hampden county, Mass.); No. 5, Souhegan-East, N. H.; No. 6,\r\nTempleton, Mass.; No. 7, Gorham, Me. Thomas Tileston, of Dorchester,\r\ndrew \"Number 5, Souhegan-East;\" of the one hundred and twenty grantees\r\nwhom he represented, fifty-seven belonged to Boston, fifteen to\r\nRoxbury, seven to Dorchester, two to Milton, five to Braintree, four\r\nto Weymouth, thirteen to Hingham, four to Dedham, two to Hull, one to\r\nMedfield, five to Scituate, and one to Newport, R. I. In the fifteen\r\nRoxbury grantees was Zechariah Chandler, who was one of the few who\r\npersonally took up land under the grant and settled upon it one of his\r\nown family. As a rule the grantees sold their claims to others. On the\r\ntown records Zechariah Chandler's name is signed in the right of his\r\nwife's father, Thomas Bishop, who served against King Philip. His son,\r\nThomas Chandler, took possession of the land and was among the pioneers\r\nof the town. To-day the Chandler family is believed to be the only\r\nrepresentative in Bedford of the original grantees. It was in 1737,\r\n1738, and 1739 that systematic settlement practically began in this\r\npart of the Merrimack valley.\r\n\r\nIn 1741 New Hampshire became a separate province, and in 1748 the\r\nfarmers of Souhegan-East, finding themselves without any township\r\norganization and without the power to legally transact corporate\r\nbusiness, called upon the government for relief. As a result, it is\r\nrecorded that on the 11th of April in that year Gov. Benning Wentworth\r\ninformed the Council of New Hampshire \"of the situation of a number of\r\npersons inhabiting a place called Souhegan-East, within this Province,\r\nthat were without any township or District, and had not the privilege\r\nof a town in choosing officers for regulating their affairs, such as\r\nraising money for the ministry,\" etc. Thereupon a provisional township\r\norganization was authorized, under which the municipality was managed\r\nuntil 1750, when, on the 10th of May, the following petition was sent\r\nto the Governor, signed by thirty-eight citizens, among them Thomas\r\nChandler:\r\n\r\n  To his Excellency, Benning Wentworth, Esq., Governor and\r\n    Commander-in-Chief of his Majesty's Province of New Hampshire,\r\n    and to the Honorable, his Majesty's Council, assembled at\r\n    Portsmouth, May 10, 1750.\r\n\r\n  The humble Petition of the subscribers, inhabitants of\r\n  Souhegan-East, so-called, sheweth, That your Petitioners are major\r\n  part of said Souhegan; that your petitioners, as to our particular\r\n  persuasion in Christianity, are generally of the Presbyterian\r\n  denomination; that your petitioners, through a variety of causes,\r\n  having long been destitute of the gospel, are now desirous of\r\n  taking proper steps in order to have it settled among us in that\r\n  way of discipline which we judge to tend most to our edification;\r\n  that your petitioners, not being incorporated by civil authority,\r\n  are in no capacity to raise those sums of money, which may be\r\n  needful in order to our proceeding in the above important affair.\r\n  May it therefore please your Excellency, and Honors, to take the\r\n  case of your petitioners under consideration, and to incorporate\r\n  us into a town or district, or in case any part of our inhabitants\r\n  should be taken off by any neighboring district, to grant that\r\n  those of our persuasion, who are desirous of adhering to us, may\r\n  be excused from supporting any other parish charge, than where\r\n  they conscientiously adhere, we desiring the same liberty to those\r\n  within our bounds, if any there be, and your petitioners shall ever\r\n  pray, &c.\r\n\r\nThis petition was presented on May 18, 1750, to the Council, which\r\nunanimously advised the granting of a charter, and this the Governor\r\ndid upon the following day. The name of the town was changed by\r\nGovernor Wentworth from Souhegan-East to Bedford, it is said in honor\r\nof the fourth Duke of Bedford, then Secretary of State in the ministry\r\nof George II. This was the formal organization of the present town,\r\nwhich has a territorial extent of about twenty thousand acres of land.\r\n\r\nOf the early population of this and neighboring towns \"The Centennial\r\nHistory of Bedford\" (published in 1851) says:\r\n\r\n  With few exceptions the early inhabitants of the town were from\r\n  the North of Ireland or from the then infant settlement of\r\n  Londonderry, N. H., to which they had recently emigrated from\r\n  Ireland. Their ancestors were of Scotch origin. About the middle\r\n  of the seventeenth century they went in considerable numbers\r\n  from Argylshire, in the West of Scotland, to the counties of\r\n  Londonderry and Antrim, in the North of Ireland, from which in\r\n  1718 a great emigration took place to this country. Some arrived\r\n  at Boston, and some at Casco Bay near Portland, which last were\r\n  the settlers of Londonderry. Many towns in this vicinity were\r\n  settled from this colony. Windham, Chester, Litchfield, Manchester,\r\n  Bedford, Goffstown, New Boston, Antrim, Peterborough and Acworth\r\n  derived from Londonderry a considerable proportion of their first\r\n  inhabitants.\r\n\r\n  Many of their descendants have risen to high respectability, among\r\n  whom are numbered four Governors of New Hampshire, one of the\r\n  signers of the Declaration of Independence, several distinguished\r\n  officers in the Revolutionary War and in the last war with Great\r\n  Britain, including Stark, Reid, Miller, and McNeil, a President\r\n  of Bowdoin College, some Members of Congress, and several\r\n  distinguished ministers of the gospel.\r\n\r\nIt was a Scottish stock, with an Irish preceding the American\r\ntransplanting, that peopled Bedford. There were among its original\r\nsettlers a few families of English and fewer still of pure Milesian\r\nextraction, but the Scotch descent was overwhelmingly predominant,\r\nand the austere theology and noble traditions of the Kirk of Scotland\r\nformed the leaven of the community. Their religious history dated back\r\nto John Knox. Their immediate ancestors were the sturdy Presbyterians\r\nwith whom James I. colonized depopulated Ulster after he had crushed\r\nthe Catholic uprisings. Those involuntary colonists made that the\r\nmost prosperous of the Irish provinces, and at a critical moment for\r\nthe cause of Protestantism added to the annals of heroic endurance\r\nthe defense of Londonderry against the army of James II. But to their\r\nsimple and tenacious faith the tithes and rents of the Anglican Church\r\nwere scarcely less abhorrent than Catholic persecution, and the\r\nexample of Puritan emigration ultimately led them by thousands to\r\nAmerican shores. Much of this tide of settlement was diverted by the\r\nPuritan pre-occupation of New England soil to the Middle and Southern\r\nStates, but a strong current set up into northern New England and\r\noccupied (with much other territory) the valley of the Merrimack. It\r\nwas to these Scotch-Irish Presbyterians that the greater number of\r\nthe grantees of Bedford--as a rule the descendants of Massachusetts\r\nPuritans--sold their claims, and the community became what their labors\r\nand influence made it. The Chandler (representing an original grantee)\r\nwas one of the few Bedford families which sprang from English stock and\r\npossessed Puritan antecedents.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of Bedford was thus the outgrowth of an unquenchable\r\nthirst for civil and religious liberty. A profound conscientiousness\r\nadded these simple, devout, frugal, and industrious people to the\r\npioneer assailants of the North American wilderness. The ancient\r\nrecords and the published annals of the town afford a quaintly\r\ninteresting picture of early New England civilization. Its background\r\nis the rock of religious faith, and to repeat the chronicles of the\r\nBedford church for the eighteenth century is to write the history\r\nof the township for that period. The original grant required the\r\nmaintenance of \"a learned, orthodox ministry.\" The petition for\r\nthe charter of Bedford set forth that \"your petitioners, as to\r\nour particular persuasion in Christianity, are generally of the\r\nPresbyterian denomination,\" and assigned as the chief reason for asking\r\nincorporation that they \"having been long destitute of the gospel, are\r\nnow desirous of taking the proper steps in order to have it settled\r\namong us,\" but \"not being incorporated by civil authority are in no\r\ncapacity to raise those sums of money which may be needful.\" The\r\nofficial records of formal township proceedings abound in such entries\r\nas these:\r\n\r\n  _Feb. 15. 1748._ _Voted_--That one third of the time, Preaching\r\n  shall be to accommodate the inhabitants at the upper end of the\r\n  town; one other third part, at the lower end of the town; the last\r\n  third, about Strawberrie hill.\r\n\r\n  _July 26, 1750._ _Voted_, There be a call given to the Rev. Mr.\r\n  Alexander Boyd, to the work of the ministry in this town.\r\n\r\n  _March 28, 1753._ _Voted_, Unanimously, to present a call for Mr.\r\n  Alexander McDowell, to the Rev'd Presbytery for the work of the\r\n  ministry in this town.\r\n\r\n  _March 13, 1757._ _Voted_,--That Capt. Moses Barron, Robert Walker,\r\n  and Samuel Patten, be a committee for boarding and shingling the\r\n  meeting-house.\r\n\r\n  _March, 1767._ _Voted_,--That the same committee who built the\r\n  pulpit, paint it, and paint it the same color the Rev. Mr.\r\n  McGregor's pulpit is, in Londonderry.\r\n\r\n  _June, 1768._ The meeting-house glass lent out[1]; Matthew Little's\r\n  account of the same. David Moore had from Matthew Little, six\r\n  squares of the meeting-house glass; Daniel Moor had 4 squares of\r\n  the same, Dea. Gilmore had of the same, 24 squares. _November 20,\r\n  1768_, the Rev. Mr. John Houston, had 24 squares of the same; Hugh\r\n  Campbell had 12 squares of the same; Dea. Smith is to pay Whitfield\r\n  Gilmore 6 squares of the same; James Wallace had 15 squares of the\r\n  same; John Bell had 9 squares of the same; Joseph Scobey, one quart\r\n  of oil.\r\n\r\n  A true record.\r\n\r\n                                    Attest, WILLIAM WHITE, _Town Clerk_.\r\n\r\n  [Extract from the \"town meeting warrant\" (call) for 1779]: As for\r\n  some time past, the Sabbath has been greatly profaned, by persons\r\n  traveling with burthens upon the same, when there is no necessity\r\n  for it,--to see whether the town will not try to provide some\r\n  remedy for the same, for the future.\r\n\r\nThe Bedford church has been ever the center of all public activity.\r\nIts officers have been the officers of the town. From its pulpit\r\nhave been made all formal announcements. Within its walls have been\r\ninspired every important home measure, and its influence has stimulated\r\neach wise public action. In the early records the school-house also\r\nshares prominence with the meeting-house, and the later generations of\r\nBedford's inhabitants were men and women of solid primary education and\r\nthorough religious training. Thrift and industry made them prosperous,\r\nand they raised large families of powerful men and vigorous women.\r\nThe mothers and daughters shared in the field work, and even carried\r\non foot to Boston the linen thread from their busy spinning wheels.\r\nPhysical and moral strength characterized the race, and they built up\r\na community of comfortable homes, severe virtues, strong religious\r\ninstincts, a stern morality, and long lives. Neither poverty nor riches\r\nwere to be found among them, and the simplest habits prevailed. Silks\r\nwere unknown, and homemade linen was the choicest fabric. Brown bread\r\nwas the staple of life, and wheat flour a luxury. Tea and coffee were\r\nrarely seen, but barley broth was on all tables. Shoes were only worn\r\nin winter, except to church on Sundays when they were carried in the\r\nhand to the neighborhood of the meeting-house. The saddle and pillion\r\nwere used in journeys. Splinters and knots of pitch pine furnished\r\nlights. The hymns were \"deaconed out\" by the line at the meeting-house,\r\nand at the appearance of the first bass-viol in the gallery (about\r\n1790) there was a fierce rebellion among the more austere of the\r\nworshipers. There was community of effort in all important enterprises,\r\nand no man needed aught if his neighbor could supply it.\r\n\r\nBut this frontier picture is not wholly stern in its lines. Along with\r\nthis simplicity of life and severity of religious doctrine there was no\r\nlack of frolic and rough joking, and the other rugged characteristics\r\nwere relieved by shrewd wit and native humor. The annals of Bedford\r\nare entertaining and abound in such anecdotes as these: Deacon John\r\nOrr (the grandfather of the mother of Zachariah Chandler) was a sturdy\r\nIrish-Scotchman, whose temper under extreme provocation once got\r\nthe better of his devoutness and led him into a vigorous profanity\r\nof speech. This glaring dereliction in a church officer called for\r\nreprimand, and he was waited upon by the minister and a delegation of\r\nhis brethren who asked, \"How could you suffer yourself to speak so?\"\r\n\"Why, what was it?\" His offending language was repeated to him. \"And\r\nwhat o' that!\" said he, \"D'ye expect me to be a' spirit and nae flesh?\"\r\nLate in life Deacon Orr visited Boston with a load of produce and\r\nput up at a house of entertainment where, after he had drunk several\r\ncups of tea, and refused a final invitation, the landlady said that\r\nit was customary to turn the cup upside down to show that no more\r\nwas wanted. He apologized and promised to remember the injunction.\r\nThe next morning he partook of a huge bowl of bread and milk for\r\nbreakfast, and not wanting the whole laid down his spoon and turned\r\nthe dish upside down with its contents on the table. The hostess was\r\nnaturally angry, but was met with the statement that he had merely\r\nfollowed her own direction. The answer of a brother deacon to one of\r\nthe congregation who complained, \"I could na' mak yesterday's preaching\r\ncome together,\" was a compend of practical Christianity: \"Trouble\r\nyourself na' about that, man--a' ye have to do, man, is to fear God\r\nand keep His commandments.\" It is also told that the objections of one\r\nof the staunch Scotch Presbyterians of Bedford to the marriage of his\r\ndaughter with an urgent suitor of Catholic parentage were overcome by\r\nthe apt query, \"If a man happened to be born in a stable would that\r\nmake him a horse?\" And to one of the rural theologians of the town\r\nis credited this contribution to ecclesiastical distinctions: \"The\r\ndifference between the Presbyterians and Congregationalists is this:\r\nThe Congregationalist goes home and eats a regular dinner between\r\nservices, but the Presbyterian postpones his until after meeting.\"\r\nAfter a most vigorous quarrel between the minister and one of the flock\r\nover a boundary line dispute, the wrathful member of the congregation\r\nwas prompt at service on Sunday with the following explanation: \"I'd\r\nhave ye to know, if I did quarrel with the minister, I did not quarrel\r\nwith the Gospel.\"\r\n\r\nThat this was a community of uncompromising patriotism follows from its\r\ncharacter. In the French and Indian war the New England forces were at\r\none time under command of Col. John Goffe, of Bedford, and the number\r\nof privates enlisted from that town was large. The New Hampshire\r\nregiment which joined the expedition of General Amherst against Canada,\r\ncommanded by Colonel Goffe, was raised largely among the Scotch-Irish\r\nemigrants of Hillsborough and Rockingham counties, and had in its ranks\r\nmany Bedford men. In the Revolutionary War a large portion of its\r\nable-bodied citizens were in the first American army that beleaguered\r\nBoston and fought at Bunker Hill; nearly or quite half of all who\r\ncould handle a musket were with Stark at Bennington, and with Gates at\r\nSaratoga. General Stark lived but a few rods from the town line on the\r\nnorth, and one of his most trusted officers was Lieutenant, afterwards\r\nColonel, John Orr, of Bedford. The town records abound with votes taken\r\nto carry out the measures proposed by the Continental Congress, and\r\nalso chronicle one case of semi-Toryism and its punishment. In 1776\r\nCongress advised the disarming of all who were disaffected towards the\r\nAmerican cause, and the selectmen of the New Hampshire towns circulated\r\nthis pledge among their people:\r\n\r\n  In consequence of the above Resolution of the Continental Congress,\r\n  and to show our determination in joining our American brethren, in\r\n  defending the lives, liberties, and properties of the inhabitants\r\n  of the United Colonies, We, the Subscribers, do hereby solemnly\r\n  engage and promise, that we will, to the utmost of our power, at\r\n  the risk of our lives and fortunes, with arms, oppose the hostile\r\n  proceedings of the British Fleets and Armies against the United\r\n  American Colonies.\r\n\r\nAmong its Bedford signers were John Orr, Zachariah Chandler, and Samuel\r\nPatten (all ancestors of Zachariah Chandler,) and the report made from\r\nthat town was this:\r\n\r\n  To the honorable, the Council and House of Representatives, for\r\n    the Colony of New Hampshire, to be convened in Exeter, in said\r\n    Colony, on Wednesday, 5th inst.\r\n\r\n  Pursuant to the within precept, we have taken pains to know the\r\n  minds of the inhabitants of the town of Bedford, with respect to\r\n  the within obligation, and find none unwilling to sign the same,\r\n  except _the Rev. John Houston_, who declines signing the said\r\n  obligation, for the following reasons: Firstly, Because he did\r\n  not apprehend that the honorable Committee meant that Ministers\r\n  should take up arms, as being inconsistent with their ministerial\r\n  charge. Secondly, Because he was already confined to the County of\r\n  Hillsborough, therefore, he thinks he ought to be set at liberty\r\n  before he should sign the said obligation. Thirdly, Because there\r\n  are three men belonging to his family already enlisted in the\r\n  Continental Army.\r\n\r\nMr. Houston, who was thus officially reported as the only Bedford Tory,\r\nhad occupied the town pulpit for over fifteen years, and was a man of\r\nscholarship and purity, but he had become a loyalist in sympathy at\r\nthe outbreak of the Revolutionary troubles, and was as inflexible in\r\nconviction as his neighbors. Originally (in 1756) the town had voted\r\nthat his salary should be at the rate of forty pounds sterling a year\r\nfor such Sundays as they desired his services. When they felt unable to\r\npay they voted him one or more Sundays for himself, and then deducted\r\nfrom his salary proportionately. In 1775, after prolonged controversy\r\nwith him, his case was brought before town-meeting (on June 15th), and\r\nhe was unanimously dismissed by the adoption of a vote setting off for\r\nhis own use all the Sabbaths remaining in the calendar year. The town\r\nrecords contain this explanation of the action:\r\n\r\n  _June 15, 1775._ _Voted_--Whereas, we find that the Rev'd Mr. John\r\n  Houston, after a great deal of tenderness and pains taken with\r\n  him, both in public and private, and toward him, relating to his\r\n  speeches, frequently made both in public and private, against the\r\n  rights and privileges of America, and his vindicating of King and\r\n  Parliament in their present proceedings against the Americans; and\r\n  having not been able hitherto to bring him to a sense of his error,\r\n  and he has thereby rendered himself despised by people in general,\r\n  and by us in particular, and that he has endeavored to intimidate\r\n  us against maintaining the just rights of America: Therefore, we\r\n  think it not our duty as men or Christians, to have him preach any\r\n  longer with us as our minister.\r\n\r\nThe resolute and uncompromising spirit, which thus sternly resented\r\nand punished unpatriotic sympathies in one whom the people had been\r\naccustomed to hold in reverence, was manifested on all occasions. This\r\nis a document of later date, signed by a Bedford committee, which seems\r\nnot to have been suggested by any outside action, but to have resulted\r\nfrom the impulses of the citizens themselves:\r\n\r\n                                                _Bedford, May 31, 1783._\r\n\r\n  To Lieut. John Orr, Representative at the General Court of the\r\n    State of New Hampshire:--\r\n\r\n  Sir:--Although we have full confidence in your fidelity and public\r\n  virtue, and conceive that you would at all times pursue such\r\n  measures only as tend to the public good, yet upon the particular\r\n  occasion of our instructing you, we conceive that it will be an\r\n  advantage to have your sentiments fortified by those of your\r\n  constituents.\r\n\r\n  The occasion is this; the return of those persons to this country,\r\n  who are known in Great Britain by the name of loyalist, but in\r\n  America, by those of conspirators, absentees, and tories;\r\n\r\n  We agree that you use your influence that these persons do not\r\n  receive the least encouragement to return to dwell among us, they\r\n  not deserving favor, as they left us in the righteous cause we were\r\n  engaged in, fighting for our undoubted rights and liberties, and as\r\n  many of them acted the part of the most inveterate enemies.\r\n\r\n  And further,--that they do not receive any favor of any kind, as we\r\n  esteem them as persons not deserving it, but the contrary.\r\n\r\n  You are further directed to use your influence, that those who are\r\n  already returned, be treated according to their deserts.\r\n\r\nIn the War of 1812 there were more than two hundred men in Bedford\r\narmed and in readiness to march whenever called upon, and in this two\r\nhundred was one company of about sixty men over forty years of age\r\nand therefore exempt from military duty. In the War of the Rebellion\r\nBedford invariably filled its quota without draft and without high\r\nbounties, and it paid its war debt promptly.\r\n\r\nIt was in this community of stalwart, clear-headed, freedom-loving,\r\nsturdily honest, and uncompromisingly sincere men and women, that\r\nZachariah Chandler was born and that the foundations of his character\r\nwere durably laid.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The glass for the meeting-house was procured before the building\r\nwas ready for it, and it was loaned to different members; the careful\r\nrecord kept shows how scarce and costly an article it then was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPARENTAGE AND CHILDHOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chandlers of New England are the descendants of William Chandler,\r\nwho came from England in the days of the Puritan immigration--about\r\n1637--and settled in Roxbury, in the Massachusetts Bay Colony.\r\nThe Chandlers of Bedford, N. H., are the posterity of one of his\r\ndescendants, Zechariah Chandler of Roxbury, who was among the grantees\r\nof Souhegan-East in the right of his wife, the daughter of a soldier\r\nin King Philip's War. They were the conspicuous English family in that\r\nScotch-Irish Presbyterian settlement, and their farm is the only one in\r\nthat town which is still in possession of the lineal descendants of an\r\noriginal grantee. That Zechariah Chandler was a man of some means is\r\nshown by this document, which is still on record and reads curiously\r\nenough in the biography of a most inveterate and powerful opponent of\r\nslavery and the slave power:\r\n\r\n                                              BOSTON, November 11, 1740.\r\n\r\n  Received of Mr. Zechariah Chandler, one hundred and ten pounds, in\r\n  full, for a Negro Boy, sold and delivered him for my master, John\r\n  Jones.\r\n\r\n  £110                                            WM. MERCHANT, Jun'r.\r\n\r\nThis slave was taken to Bedford, but soon freed by his owner, when he\r\nassumed the name of Primas Chandler. Although past the usual military\r\nage, in 1775 he enlisted as a private in the service of the colonies,\r\nwas captured by the British at \"The Cedars\" and was never afterwards\r\nheard from by his friends. He left a wife and two sons in Bedford, but\r\nhis family has since become extinct.\r\n\r\nThe first settlers in Bedford located chiefly on the rocky and hilly\r\nterritory which is now the central and most thickly inhabited portion\r\nof the town. East of this, in the smooth and fertile intervale of\r\nthe Merrimack, judging by the names on the most ancient maps, the\r\nsettlers were chiefly of English descent, and among them was Thomas\r\nChandler, the son of Zechariah, and the first actual occupant of the\r\nland granted to his father. He married Hannah, a daughter of Col. John\r\nGoffe, by whom he had four children--three daughters and a son named\r\nalso Zachariah, who married Sarah Patten, the second daughter of Capt.\r\nSamuel Patten. This Zachariah, the grandfather of his namesake, the\r\nSenator, died on April 20, 1830, at the age of 79, and his widow died\r\nin 1842, aged nearly 94. From them were descended the two families of\r\nChandlers, who in the present generation have been prominent in Bedford.\r\n\r\nThe oldest son of Zachariah was named Thomas, and was born August 10,\r\n1772. He had four children--Asenath, who married Stephen Kendrick, of\r\nNashville; Sarah, who married Caleb Kendrick; Hannah, who married Rufus\r\nKendrick, a well-known citizen of Boston; and Adam, who now lives in\r\nManchester, where also reside his three sons, Henry and Byron, who are\r\nconnected with the Amoskeag National Bank, and John, who is a prominent\r\nmerchant of that city. The only daughter of Zachariah, Sarah, remained\r\nsingle, and lived at the old homestead, which had become her property,\r\nuntil her death in 1852. Throughout that whole region she was known for\r\nyears as \"Aunt Sarah.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHANDLER HOMESTEAD, AT BEDFORD, N. H.]\r\n\r\nSamuel, the second son of Zachariah, was born May 28, 1774, and\r\nmarried Margaret Orr, the oldest daughter of General Stark's most\r\ntrusted officer, Col. John Orr. They had seven children, one of whom\r\ndied in infancy. Those who reached maturity were Mary Jane, who was\r\nsuccessively married to the Rev. Cyrus Downs, the Rev. David P. Smith,\r\nand the Rev. Samuel Lee, and who is still living, the last surviving\r\nmember of the seven, at the present homestead; Annis, who married\r\nFranklin Moore and became a resident of Detroit; Samuel, Jr., who,\r\nafter four years at Dartmouth and Union colleges, lost his health\r\nand died in Detroit in 1835; Zachariah, the subject of this memorial\r\nvolume; and John Orr, who, after graduating at Dartmouth, spent one\r\nyear in Andover Theological Seminary, came in feeble health to Detroit\r\nwhere he was tenderly cared for by his brother, and finally went by way\r\nof New Orleans to Cuba, where he died in January, 1839, his remains\r\nbeing subsequently removed to the Bedford burying-ground. The father,\r\nSamuel, died in Bedford on January 11, 1870, at the age of 95, and the\r\nmother in 1855, at the age of 81.\r\n\r\nThe Chandlers during the three generations from Thomas to Samuel were\r\nthus allied by marriage to three of the most noted families, not only\r\nin Bedford but in New Hampshire, the Goffes, Pattens and Orrs. They\r\nwere generally long-lived, although consumption developed in different\r\ngenerations, and were always prominent in town and church matters. The\r\nThomas Chandler who first settled in Bedford was one of the signers\r\nof the petition for incorporation in 1750, and was conspicuously\r\nconnected with all local movements at that time. His grandson Thomas,\r\nthe Senator's uncle, was in the Legislature several terms, and in\r\nCongress from 1829 to 1833, being elected as a Jackson Democrat. His\r\nname is frequently mentioned in the records of the church where he was\r\nchoir-leader and where he formed a class for instruction in sacred\r\nmusic. He was also selectman for many years, and held other positions\r\nin connection with the town government. He as well as his father \"kept\r\ntavern\" on one of the main New England thoroughfares of those days, and\r\nboth were widely known through that region. Samuel, the father of the\r\nSenator, played the first bass-viol ever used in the church choir, and\r\nhelped to stem the tide of indignation with which the introduction of\r\nthis \"ungodly\" instrument was met by the more rigid members of that\r\northodox Presbyterian body. His name often appears in the records\r\nas clerk of the church, selectman, and town clerk. He was for over\r\ntwenty years consecutively a justice of the peace, and in his hands\r\nwas usually placed such business as the settlement of estates. In the\r\nlist of town officers the name of Chandler appears almost every year,\r\nand in almost all church and public gatherings for over a century some\r\nmember of this family was present among the active and public-spirited\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BIRTHPLACE OF ZACHARIAH CHANDLER.]\r\n\r\nThe first house built on the Chandler farm was on the east side of\r\nthe river road, and not far from the present homestead. It was torn\r\ndown many years ago, but the cellar was visible until within a\r\ncomparatively recent period. The second house was built before the\r\nRevolutionary War, by the grandfather of the Senator, and this is\r\nstill standing, though it has been remodeled and modernized. It was\r\nused as a tavern and court-house during that war. In this the second\r\nZachariah and his wife lived for many years, and in this they and their\r\ndaughter Sarah died. During their declining years they were cared for\r\nthere by the mother of Rodney M. Rollins, the present occupant and\r\nowner of the place, and the house, with forty acres of land, was willed\r\nto Mrs. Rollins by \"Aunt Sarah\" previous to her death. This was the\r\nfirst alienation from the possession of the family of any part of the\r\nChandler farm. Although the house has been remodeled, it retains many\r\nof its old features, and one apartment at the northwest corner has been\r\npreserved nearly as it was at the time of the Revolution. It is called\r\nthe Revolutionary room, and has still in its furniture some of the\r\nchairs that were there a hundred years ago, and among its fixtures an\r\nancient buffet, carved by hand and unchanged except by paint since 1776.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the road, fronting the east, and in sight of\r\nthe Merrimack, where it takes its broad sweep above Goff's Falls, is\r\nthe present Chandler homestead, which was built by Samuel Chandler in\r\n1800, before his marriage. It remains to-day almost precisely as first\r\nconstructed, and seems good for half a century more. Its rooms are\r\nlarge, and the ceilings unusually high for a farm-house of the earlier\r\ntimes. The front portion contains four large apartments on the lower\r\nfloor, and in the rear are the dining-room, the kitchen, the pantry,\r\nand store-rooms. In the second story are five bed-rooms, with closets\r\nand additional store-room, and above these is a spacious attic. Among\r\nthe furniture are chairs and chests of drawers of pro-revolutionary\r\ntimes, one of the ancient four-post bedsteads common a hundred years\r\nago, and brass andirons which would delight the eyes of a lover of\r\nantique relics. Here still lives the Senator's oldest sister, and here\r\nthe family of seven were born.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient family bible, printed in 1803 and preserved by Mrs. Lee,\r\nis an entry of a birth, of which this is a fac-simile:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Zacharias Chandler\r\n\r\nBorn Decʳ. 10ᵗʰ 1813]\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the given name is written Zacharias. Mrs. Lee\r\nstill speaks of her brother as Zacharias, and his name is also so\r\nprinted in the Chandler genealogy in the centennial history of Bedford.\r\nThe Senator in his signatures simply used the initial of his first\r\nname, but he ultimately adopted the ancestral Zachariah, and that was\r\nthe name which he made famous, and by which he will be known in this\r\nbiography.\r\n\r\nZachariah Chandler's father and paternal grandfather, Samuel and\r\nZachariah, are described as spare men of medium stature, but energetic\r\nand full of endurance. His mother, Margaret Orr, was tall and powerful;\r\nher distinguished son resembled her in face, and inherited from her\r\nmany of his most vigorous traits. She was a woman of great strength\r\nof character and robust sense, and exercised a large influence over\r\nher children. Her family was a remarkable one; her father was the\r\nconspicuous man of his day in his part of New Hampshire; her brother,\r\nBenjamin Orr, became the foremost lawyer of Maine early in the\r\npresent century, and served one term from that State in Congress; her\r\nhalf-brother, the Rev. Isaac Orr, was a man of many accomplishments\r\nand a diverse scholarship, a prolific writer on scientific and\r\nphilosophical topics, and with a claim on the general gratitude as the\r\ninventor of the application of the air-tight principle to the common\r\nstove.\r\n\r\nThe boy Zachariah was healthy, strong, quick-tempered, and\r\nself-reliant, and the contrast was marked between his sturdiness\r\nand the constitutional feebleness of his short-lived brothers. The\r\ntraditions of his childhood, still fondly cherished by his surviving\r\nsister, all show that from his cradle he was ready to fight his own\r\nbattles, and that his \"pluckiness\" was innate. One juvenile anecdote\r\nrelated by Mrs. Lee will illustrate scores that might be repeated: His\r\nfather's poultry-yard was ruled by a large and ill-tempered gander, the\r\nstrokes of whose horny beak were the dread of the smaller children. The\r\noldest brother was one day driven back by this fowl while attempting to\r\ncross the road, when the young \"Zach.,\" then three years old, called\r\nout \"Do, Sammy, do, I'll keep e' dander off,\" and rushed into a pitched\r\nand victorious battle with the \"dander,\" during which his brother made\r\ngood his escape.\r\n\r\nHis rudimentary education was obtained in the little brick school-house\r\nat Bedford, which remains substantially unchanged and is still used.\r\nHere he attended school regularly from the age of five or six until he\r\nwas fourteen or fifteen. He had an excellent memory, and was a good\r\nscholar, standing well with others of his age. He was a leader in the\r\nboys' sports, always active, and entering with zest into every frolic.\r\nOf these days, one of his early playmates--now the Rev. S. G. Abbott,\r\nof Stamford, Conn.--thus writes: \"The death of Mr. Chandler revives\r\nthe memories of half a century ago. The old brick school-house where\r\nwe were taught together the rudiments of our education; the country\r\nstore where his father sold such a wonderful variety of merchandise\r\nfor the wants of the inner and outer man; the broad acres of field\r\nand forest in the ancestral domain where we used to rove and hunt;\r\nhis uncle's 'tavern,' the cheerful home of the traveler when there\r\nwere no railroads, situated on a great thoroughfare, constantly alive\r\nwith stages, teams, cattle, sheep, swine, turkeys, and pedestrian\r\nimmigrants--all these form a picture as distinct to the mind's eye as\r\nif a scene of the present. No unimportant feature of that picture in\r\nmy boyish memory was a rough-built, overgrown, awkward, good-natured,\r\npopular boy, who went by the never-forgotten, familiar sobriquet of\r\n'Zach.' He never forgot it. After more than forty years' separation,\r\nwhen I called on him in the capitol, and apologized for calling him\r\nZach., in his old, rollicking way he said 'Oh, you can call me _old_\r\nZach., that's what they all call me out West.'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SCHOOL-HOUSE AT BEDFORD, N. H.]\r\n\r\nIn his fifteenth and sixteenth years he attended the academies at\r\nPembroke and Derry, with his older brother, who was fitting for\r\ncollege. In the winter following he taught school one term in the\r\nPiscataquog or \"Squog\" district. As is the rule in country schools,\r\nmany of the pupils were about as large as the teacher, and the \"Squog\"\r\nboys had the reputation of being especially unruly. The usual disorders\r\ncommenced, but after some trouble the energetic young man from the\r\nChandler farm established his supremacy, and the scholars recognized\r\nthe fact that there was a head to the school. Mr. Chandler always spoke\r\nwith interest of his brief experience in teaching, although he never\r\nclaimed any particular success in that calling. While he was thus\r\nemployed the teacher of the brick school, in which he had been so long\r\na pupil, was a Dartmouth sophomore who in his \"boarding around\" was\r\nespecially welcome at the house of Samuel Chandler. This was James F.\r\nJoy, who then formed with the young Zachariah an intimacy, which ranked\r\namong the causes that determined Mr. Joy's own selection of Detroit as\r\na home, and lasted through life.\r\n\r\nIn the latter years of his school life young Chandler worked on the\r\nfarm through the summer, and the last season that he was home he took\r\nentire charge, employing the help and superintending the labor. Thomas\r\nKendall, who was with him during three summers, and who is still living\r\nin Bedford, says, \"Zach. was a good man to work and a good man to\r\nwork for.\" He was just in his dealings with the men, but vigorous as\r\nan overseer, and himself as good a \"farm hand\" as there was. Stories\r\nare still told of his achievements in mowing contests with the men.\r\nHe had no liking, as had many of his fellows, for hunting or fishing,\r\nbut he was fond of athletic sports, and was the best wrestler in town.\r\n\"Whoever took hold of Zach.,\" says Mr. Kendall, \"had to go down.\"\r\n\r\nDuring one of the last years of his residence at Bedford, Mr. Chandler\r\nwas enrolled in the local militia company and turned out at the\r\n\"general muster.\" He did not, however, succeed in bringing himself\r\nto perfect obedience to the orders of the young captain, whom he\r\nknew he could easily out-wrestle and out-mow, and was arrested for\r\ninsubordination. He was kept under arrest through one afternoon, but\r\nthe court-martial which had been ordered for his trial was recalled\r\nand he was released. He was afterwards for a short time on the staff\r\nof the commanding officer, General Riddle, but his removal from New\r\nHampshire took place at about this time. After his Janesville, Wis.,\r\nspeech, two days before his death, Mr. Chandler was called upon by\r\nthe Captain Colley who had placed him under arrest nearly fifty years\r\nbefore. Mr. Colley is now a resident of Rock county, Wis., and had\r\ndriven a long distance to listen to his old-time subordinate, or rather\r\ninsubordinate, and to revive with him old memories.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1833 Zachariah Chandler entered the store of Kendrick\r\n& Foster of Nashua, and in September of that year, moved by the\r\nsame impulse that has sent so many New Englanders into the growing\r\nterritories, turned his face Westward, and in company with his\r\nbrother-in-law, the late Franklin Moore, came to the city, which from\r\nthat time to his death was his home. He had not then shown in any\r\nmarked degree the qualities which made his future success so eminent,\r\nand was apparently simply a good specimen out of thousands of the\r\nenergetic, determined, and sagacious young men, who, leaving more\r\nsterile New England, have subdued the forests, moulded the politics and\r\nconducted the business of half a dozen Western States.\r\n\r\nFor the old homestead and its occupants, and for the town of Bedford,\r\nMr. Chandler always entertained a warm affection. He was a good\r\ncorrespondent, and his home letters, which until his entrance into\r\npublic life were frequent and long, breathed a genuine feeling of\r\nfilial and brotherly affection. After his election to the Senate, with\r\nthe voluminous correspondence which his official position involved,\r\nhis letters to the old home became less frequent, but to the last\r\nhe kept up occasional communication with the surviving friends at\r\nhis birthplace. During his father's life he visited Bedford twice\r\nor more each year, and after his father's death made at least one\r\nannual journey there. In 1850, when the centennial celebration of the\r\nincorporation of the township occurred, Mr. Chandler was among those\r\ninvited to be present, and sent the following letter of regret:\r\n\r\n                                                  DETROIT, May 16, 1850.\r\n\r\n  GENTLEMEN:--I regret exceedingly my inability to accept your kind\r\n  invitation to be present at your Centennial Celebration of the\r\n  settlement of the good old town of Bedford. It would have afforded\r\n  me great pleasure to meet my old friends upon that occasion, but\r\n  circumstances beyond my own control will prevent. The ashes of the\r\n  dead, as well as the loved faces of the living, attract me strongly\r\n  to my native town, and that attachment I find increasing each day\r\n  of my life. Permit me, in conclusion, to offer: \"_The town of\r\n  Bedford_--May her descendants (widely scattered through the land)\r\n  never dishonor their paternity.\"\r\n\r\n  Be pleased to accept, for yourselves and associates, my kind\r\n  regards, and believe me,\r\n\r\n  Truly yours,\r\n                                Z. CHANDLER.\r\n\r\nHis later visits were looked forward to with much interest, not only by\r\nhis relatives, but by the neighbors, to whom a talk with him was one of\r\nthe events of the year. He was there always genial and friendly, kept\r\nup his acquaintance with the old residents, and thoroughly enjoyed his\r\nassociation with them. His last visit to the homestead was after the\r\nclose of his campaign in Maine, in August, 1879. He then met many of\r\nhis boyhood friends, and enjoyed a ramble over the undulating fields\r\nwhich stretch from the central hills toward the banks of the Merrimack.\r\nAnd as he drove for the last time down the road from the house of his\r\nbirth toward Manchester, he pointed to a pine grove which skirts the\r\nnorthern border of the Chandler farm, and said to his companion, \"That,\r\nto me, is the most beautiful grove in the world.\"\r\n\r\nNew Hampshire has been prolific in strong men with the granite of\r\nits hills in the fibres of their characters. Bedford itself has been\r\nthe birthplace of scores of the leading men of the thriving city of\r\nManchester; of Joseph E. Worcester, the lexicographer; of Benjamin\r\nOrr, of Maine; of David Aiken, Isaac O. Barnes, and Jacob Bell, of the\r\nMassachusetts bar; of the Hon. David Atwood, of Wisconsin; of Judge\r\nA. S. Thurston, of Elmira, N. Y.; of Hugh Riddle, of the Rock Island\r\nRailroad, and Gen. George Stark, of the Northern Pacific; of the Rev.\r\nSilas Aiken, of the Boston pulpit; and of others of large influence in\r\ntheir generations. But upon no one of its sons was the impress of its\r\npeculiar history so indelibly stamped as upon the young man who left\r\nit to aid in founding a powerful State amid the Great Lakes, and who\r\nbecame the foremost representative of that State's vigorous political\r\nconviction and purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nREMOVAL TO MICHIGAN--MERCANTILE SUCCESS--BUSINESS INVESTMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1833 Zachariah Chandler, then still a minor, joined the current of\r\nWestern emigration from New York and New England which had sprung up\r\nwith the completion of the Erie canal, and in the fall of that year\r\nentered into the retail dry-goods business at Detroit. Franklin Moore\r\n(the husband of his sister Annis), who had already visited Michigan,\r\ncame with him as a partner in the enterprise, and the original firm\r\nname was Moore & Chandler. At the outset the young merchant had some\r\nassistance from his father, who, the tradition is, offered him $1,000\r\nin cash or the collegiate education which his brothers received, the\r\nmoney being chosen. Samuel Chandler also subsequently bought a store\r\nfor his son's use, but it is understood that all such advances were\r\nspeedily and fully repaid. The building in which the future Senator\r\nfirst laid the foundation of his ample fortune was located where the\r\nBiddle House now stands; it adjoined the mansion of Governor Hull, and\r\nwas subsequently transformed into the American House. Upon its shelves\r\nMoore & Chandler displayed a small general stock, representing the\r\nample assortment usual in frontier stores, and saw a promising business\r\nanswer their invitations. In the following spring they removed to a\r\nbrick store (on the site now occupied by S. P. Wilcox & Co.), near the\r\nmain corner of the town (where Woodward and Jefferson avenues meet).\r\nIn the summer of 1834 Detroit was visited by the Asiatic cholera,\r\nwhich appeared in malignant form, and was attended by an appalling\r\ndeath rate, and an almost entire suspension of general traffic. Mr.\r\nChandler did not yield to the prevalent panic, but remained at his\r\nbusiness and was indefatigable in his efforts to relieve the universal\r\ndistress. His vigorous constitution and plain habits guarded his own\r\nhealth, and he cared for the sick and buried the dead without faltering\r\namid the dreadful scenes of the pestilence. For weeks he and a clerk\r\n(Mr. William N. Carpenter, of Detroit) alternated in watching by sick\r\nbeds, and, with others of like strength and courage, brightened with\r\nunassuming heroism the gloomy picture of a season of dreadful mortality.\r\n\r\nOn August 16, 1836, the firm of Moore & Chandler was dissolved, and the\r\njunior partner retained the established business, and continued its\r\nvigorous prosecution. Those who knew him then describe a fair-haired,\r\nawkward, tall, gaunt and wiry youth, blunt in his ways, simple in\r\nhabits, diffident with others, but shrewd, tireless in labor, and of\r\nunlimited energy. He worked day and night, slept in the store, often\r\non the counter or a bale of goods, acted as proprietor, salesman,\r\nor porter as was needed, lived on $300 a year, avoided society, and\r\nallowed only the Presbyterian church to divide his attention with\r\nbusiness. He kept a good stock, especially strong in the staples,\r\nbought prudently, and there was no better salesman in the West. His\r\ntrade became especially large with the farmers who used Detroit as a\r\nmarket, and the unaffected manners and homely good sense of the rising\r\nmerchant soon gave him a popularity with his rural customers that\r\nforeshadowed the strong hold of his later life on the affectionate\r\nconfidence of the yeomanry of the State.\r\n\r\nThe training which this intense application added to native vigor of\r\njudgment early made him a thorough business man, exact in dealings,\r\nstrong in an intuitive knowledge of men, sound in his judgment of\r\nvalues, prudent in ventures, and of an unflagging energy which pushed\r\nhis trade wherever an opening could be found. As interior Michigan\r\ndeveloped he added jobbing to his retail department, and became known\r\nas a close and prudent buyer, a shrewd judge of credits, and a most\r\nsuccessful collector. A business established at the commencement of an\r\nera of marvelous growth, pushed with such industry, drawn upon only for\r\nthe meagre expenses of a young man living with the closest economy,\r\nand unembarrassed by speculation, meant a fortune, and at twenty-seven\r\nyears of age Mr. Chandler found himself with success assured and wealth\r\nonly a matter of patience. His nearest approach to financial disaster\r\nwas in the ruinous crash which swept \"the wild-cat banks\" and so many\r\nmercantile enterprises out of existence in Michigan in the year 1838.\r\nLike others he found it almost impossible at that time to obtain money,\r\nand the Bank of Michigan which had promised him accommodations was\r\ncompelled by its own straitened condition to decline his paper. Thus\r\nit happened that a note for about $5,000 given to Arthur Tappan & Co.\r\nof New York fell due and went to protest. Mr. Chandler, accustomed to\r\nNew England strictness in business and exceedingly sensitive on the\r\npoint of meeting all engagements, was inclined to treat the protest as\r\nbankruptcy itself, and called upon his Bedford friend, James F. Joy,\r\nthen a young lawyer in Detroit and for years afterwards Mr. Chandler's\r\ncounsel, to have a formal assignment drawn up. What followed is given\r\nin Mr. Joy's language: \"I looked carefully into his affairs, and found\r\nthem in what I believed to be a sound and healthy condition. I then\r\nsaid: 'I won't draw an assignment for you, Chandler; there is no need\r\nof it.' 'What shall I do?' was his answer, 'I can't pay that note.'\r\nMy reply was, 'Write to Tappan & Co. and say that you cannot get the\r\ndiscounts that have been promised, but that if they will renew the note\r\nyou will be able to pay it when it next falls due.' He took my advice\r\nand went through, and never had any trouble with his finances after\r\nthat. I reminded Mr. Chandler of that occurrence about two months\r\nbefore his death, when he said he remembered it perfectly, and added\r\nthat if it had not been for that advice he might have been a clerk on a\r\nsalary to this day.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler's was the first business in Detroit whose sales aggregated\r\n$50,000 in a single year, and the reaching of that limit was hailed\r\nby the community as a great mercantile triumph. He showed increasing\r\ncommercial sagacity at every stage of his active business life. He\r\npushed his jobbing trade in all directions and made his interior\r\ncustomers his personal friends. He invested his surplus profits in\r\nproductive real estate which grew rapidly in value. He was never\r\ntempted into speculation, and he was very reluctant to incur debt. As\r\na result, ten years after he landed at Detroit he had a reputation\r\nthroughout the new Northwest as a merchant of ample means, personal\r\nhonesty, large connections, and remarkable enterprise.\r\n\r\nBetween 1840 and 1850 Mr. Chandler reduced his business to a purely\r\nwholesale basis and made himself independently and permanently rich. He\r\nhad opportunities and they were improved to the full. [And it may be\r\nhere said without exaggeration that every dollar of the fortune with\r\nwhich he closed his career as an active merchant represented legitimate\r\nbusiness enterprise; it was the product of personal industry and good\r\njudgment put forth in a field wisely selected and with only slight aid\r\nat the outset.] The wiry stripling had become a stalwart man, despite a\r\nfamily consumptive tendency which at times caused alarm. Prosperity did\r\nnot affect the plainness of his manners and speech, nor the simplicity\r\nof his character, and maturity added method to, without impairing, his\r\npowers of personal application. He was a man alive with energy and\r\nthoroughly in earnest. He was active and influential in all public\r\nmatters in Detroit. Every year he drove through the State, visited its\r\ncross-roads and its clearings, saw its pioneer merchants at their homes\r\nand in their stores, made up his estimate of men and their means,\r\nstudied the growth of the State, and marked the course of the budding\r\nof its resources. He thus kept himself thoroughly informed as to the\r\nmaterial development of Michigan, and acquired that intimate knowledge\r\nof the State and its representative men which formed such an important\r\npart of his equipment for public life. His companion in these numerous\r\ncommercial journeys was the man who succeeded him in the Senate, the\r\nHon. Henry P. Baldwin of Detroit, who came to Michigan largely through\r\nhis solicitations, was engaged in business for years by his side,\r\nand remained his intimate associate through life. This part of Mr.\r\nChandler's career abounded in the making of friendships which endured\r\nuntil death. While strict in all his dealings, he was considerate and\r\nhis sympathy was quick with struggling industry and honesty. He aided\r\nwhen they needed it many who afterwards rose to position and wealth,\r\nand these men became the most firmly attached of his supporters in his\r\npublic career.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHANDLER BLOCK.]\r\n\r\nShortly after 1850 political affairs commenced to receive Mr.\r\nChandler's attention, and he gradually entrusted more and more of the\r\nactual management of his large business to others, though he still for\r\nsome years directed in a general way the operations of the house. He\r\nhad been already absent one winter on a trip to the West Indies for his\r\nhealth, and had made a brief and not wholly satisfactory experiment\r\n(about 1846) at establishing a jobbing fancy-goods trade in New York.\r\nWith these exceptions he had made his Detroit dry-goods business his\r\npersonal charge. The firm name had generally been Z. Chandler & Co.,\r\nalthough it was for some time Chandler & Bradford, and some of his\r\nrelatives had been and were associated with him in business. From his\r\nsecond location he had moved his stock to more commodious quarters on\r\nthe site now occupied by the Chandler Block, and in 1852 he again moved\r\nto the stores built jointly by himself and Mr. Baldwin on the southwest\r\ncorner of Woodward avenue and Woodbridge street. In 1855, as outside\r\nmatters commenced to press constantly upon Mr. Chandler's attention,\r\nthere came into his employment as a clerk a young man of twenty-three\r\nfrom Kinderhook, N.Y., Allan Shelden. He showed an aptitude for\r\nbusiness and a capacity for work that recalled to the head of the\r\nhouse his own earlier days, and Mr. Shelden's rise in his employer's\r\nconfidence was rapid and permanent. On Feb. 1, 1857, just before Mr.\r\nChandler took his seat as the successor of Lewis Cass in the Senate,\r\nthe firm name was changed to Orr, Town & Smith, with Mr. Chandler as a\r\nspecial partner, with an interest of $50,000. In the fall of that year,\r\nit became Town, Smith & Shelden; in the fall of 1859 it was changed to\r\nTown & Shelden; on Feb. 1, 1866, it was again changed to the present\r\nname of Allan Shelden & Co. Three years later Mr. Chandler ceased to\r\nbe a special partner, and thus finally sundered his formal connection\r\nwith the business he had established. The mercantile pre-eminence in\r\nMichigan of his house in its line of trade has been maintained by his\r\nsuccessors, and it now occupies the magnificent Chandler Block, built\r\nfor its accommodation by its founder in 1878 on Jefferson avenue in\r\nDetroit. Mr. Shelden himself continued in confidential relations with\r\nhis predecessor, and was entrusted in later years with the management\r\nof a large share of his private affairs.\r\n\r\nDuring his active business life no Northwestern merchant surpassed\r\nMr. Chandler in credit, in enterprise, or in success, and he left the\r\ncounter and office of his store with wealth and with an unsullied\r\nmercantile character. His commercial integrity and sagacity always\r\nremained among his marked characteristics. He made profitable\r\ninvestments, became interested in remunerative enterprises, and, while\r\nhe lived generously after his income warranted it, saw his riches\r\nsteadily increase under prudent and shrewd management. At the time of\r\nhis death, his estate which was absolutely unincumbered was roughly\r\nestimated as exceeding, at the least, two millions, representing\r\nvaluable business property in Detroit, several farms, large tracts of\r\ntimbered lands, the marsh farm at Lansing, residences in Washington and\r\nDetroit, bank stock, government and other securities, and investments\r\nin railroad and like enterprises. His business habits remained in full\r\nvigor to the last. He was punctuality itself in all appointments; he\r\nwas rigid in his adherence to his engagements; he hated debt, and never\r\npermitted the second presentation of an account; he did business on\r\nbusiness principles and with business exactitude; he spent money freely\r\nbut knew where and for what it went; and always his counsel was sought\r\nand prized by men engaged in enterprises of the largest magnitude.\r\nWithout being ostentatious or profuse in his charities he was a large\r\ngiver, rarely refusing a meritorious application for aid, but he\r\ninvariably satisfied himself that the object was worthy, and put a\r\nheartiness into his \"no\" when a refusal seemed to him to be in order.\r\n\r\nHis business instincts he never relaxed except for well-considered\r\nreasons. The ditching of the marsh farm he regarded as an experiment\r\nof far-reaching public importance, and he paid its cost cheerfully for\r\nthe sake of settling the question of the possibility of reclaiming such\r\nlands. Some of his \"imprudences\" of this deliberate and well-weighed\r\nsort proved profitable. During the war and when the credit of the\r\nUnited States was at an alarmingly low ebb as shown in the ruling\r\nprices of its bonds, he visited the city of New York in company\r\nwith Representative Rowland E. Trowbridge, of his State. On the way\r\nthere he spoke, in private, in a tone of unusual depression of the\r\nfinancial difficulties of the government, and lamented the absence of\r\nany available remedy. The next day there was a decided improvement in\r\nthe rates for \"governments\" on Wall street, and the firmer feeling\r\nit created never wholly disappeared but was followed by a gradual\r\nappreciation in this class of securities. Mr. Trowbridge called\r\nhis attention to the advance on the day following, and the Senator\r\nanswered, \"I know all about it. I gave my broker orders to buy heavily\r\nand the street, finding that out, said 'Chandler is just over from\r\nWashington and knows something,' and so they followed my lead, and\r\nthere was a rush which sent the market up.\" Years afterwards, Mr.\r\nChandler was reminded by Mr. Trowbridge of the permanent character\r\nof the improvement in the government's credit which attended his\r\nspeculation and of his own profit in the matter. He replied that while\r\nhe had sold many of his bonds bought during the war, he still held\r\nthose which came into his possession at that time, cherishing them\r\nfor their associations with an investment which he made at some risk\r\nto help the treasury in its difficulties and which had proved very\r\nremunerative.\r\n\r\nDuring his public life information legitimately acquired and the\r\nbroadening of his judgment by contact with men undoubtedly helped his\r\ninvestments, and thus added to his wealth, but individual pecuniary\r\nadvantage he resolutely ignored in shaping his public career. And his\r\nsturdy incorruptibility as a legislator was proverbial at the capital.\r\nAn illustration of this fact was shown in his strenuous resistance to\r\nand emphatic denunciation of the bills to remonetize and coin without\r\nlimit the old silver dollar. While these measures were pending he had\r\nconsiderable investments in silver mining stocks, which would have been\r\ngreatly increased in value by the proposed policy, but, showing one\r\nday to a friend a large draft representing a silver-mine dividend, he\r\nsaid, \"I ought for personal reasons to favor these bills, but I can't\r\nconsent to make money at the expense of the people.\" Another incident\r\nexemplifies this phase of his character: In February, 1873, the city\r\nof Manistee, on the shore of Lake Michigan, sent Gen. B. M. Cutcheon\r\nto Washington to secure an increased appropriation for the improvement\r\nof its harbor. Senator Chandler, as the chairman of the Committee on\r\nCommerce and with a reputation for vigilance in caring for Michigan\r\ninterests, was naturally relied upon for valuable assistance. He\r\nreceived General Cutcheon cordially, gave his personal attention to the\r\nmatter of introducing the representative of Manistee to influential\r\nCongressmen and to department officials, and then made an appointment\r\nfor the consideration of what his own share in the work should be.\r\nAt that private meeting he expressed to General Cutcheon his cordial\r\nsympathy with his errand, but added, \"My hands are tied; the fact is\r\nthat I am interested in large tracts of pine on the Manistee river,\r\nand, if I should take charge of your appropriation, it would be said,\r\n'Chandler is feathering his own nest;' and if I am going to retain my\r\ninfluence for good here, I must keep clear of even the suspicion of a\r\njob.\"\r\n\r\nThe great multitude who knew Mr. Chandler as a public man knew\r\nnothing of this early chapter of business life. It wholly ante-dated\r\nhis appearance at Washington, and the channels in which his strong\r\nenergies made themselves felt there and in his younger days were widely\r\ndistinct. But it is a fact that he was a remarkable man of business and\r\nas thorough a merchant as ever developed in the West a great trade from\r\nsmall beginnings. His was a doubly successful career. Before he had\r\nreached middle age he had won success in business and a fortune. Then\r\nhe entered public life and made himself a leader of men in a historic\r\nera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE PANORAMA OF NORTHWESTERN DEVELOPMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe forty-six years of Zachariah Chandler's life in Michigan saw a vast\r\nmaterial empire supplant an almost unbroken wilderness. His commercial\r\nenterprise and success and his labors as a legislator were among the\r\ninfluential agents in this marvelous development and give its story a\r\ntitle to a place in his biography.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1634 Jesuits Brebuef, Daniel and Davost, following a route\r\nexplored by Samuel Champlain eighteen years before, passed up the\r\nRiver Ottawa, across Lake Nipissing, down French river and along the\r\nlonely shores of the great Georgian bay to the dark forests bordering\r\nLake Huron. Brebuef reached there first; Daniel came later, weary and\r\nworn; Davost came last of all, half dead with famine and fatigue.[2]\r\nChamplain had been before them, and other explorers preceded Champlain,\r\nbut these three were the first Europeans who made a habitation by the\r\nshores of the great lakes which roll their tireless flood down through\r\nthe gateway of Detroit. They erected a hut, and daily rang a bell to\r\ncall the surrounding savages to prayers. Behind them was the tangled\r\nforest they had penetrated; at their feet were the broad waters of\r\nLake Huron; beyond--toward the setting sun--was an abyss so soundless\r\nthat no echo had ever come from it. And these three soldiers of the\r\ncross, converters of the heathen, unarmed and alone amid a multitude\r\nof savages, were the advance ripples of the mighty wave that two\r\ncenturies later was to break across the lake at their feet and the\r\nrivers below them and surge over the trackless wilderness beyond.\r\n\r\nSeven years later (September, 1641,) Charles Raymbault and Isaac Jaques\r\nembarked in a frail birch-bark canoe, paddling northwest from Georgian\r\nbay among the countless islands of the St. Marie river, amid scenery\r\nthat filled them with delight. After seventeen days the Sault de St.\r\nMarie burst upon their enraptured vision. There they were welcomed\r\n\"as brothers\" by the Chippewas and there began the first known white\r\nsettlement in Michigan.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of August, 1660, Rene Mesnard left Quebec, resolved to\r\nmake greater progress in the exploration of the Northwest. He ascended\r\nthe Sault in a canoe, coasted along the northern shore of the upper\r\npeninsula of Michigan, and on the 15th of October of that year reached\r\nthe head of Keweenaw bay to which he gave the name of St. Theresa.\r\nEight years later (1668) a permanent mission was established at the\r\nSault. In the autumn of 1678 occurred an event forever memorable in the\r\nannals of Michigan. There was then laid on the Niagara river the keel\r\nof the first large vessel built on the shores of the great lakes. It\r\nwas completed and launched early in the following summer, and on the\r\n7th of August, 1679 (200 years ago), amid the discharges of arquebuses\r\nand the sound of swelling _Te Deums_ it began the first voyage ever\r\nmade by Europeans upon the upper inland seas of North America. This was\r\nthe \"Griffin,\" sixty tons burden, carrying five guns, with La Salle\r\ncommander, Hennepin missionary and journalist, and a crew of Canadian\r\nfur traders. Three days later (August 10), after many soundings, they\r\nreached the islands grouped at the entrance of Detroit river. They\r\nthus knew the lake was navigable by vessels of large size--this was\r\none step toward solving the destiny of the West. Ascending the river,\r\nthe explorers passed by a large number of Indian villages; these had\r\nbeen visited years before by Jesuit missionaries and _coureurs des\r\nbois_. Some fix the date as early as 1610, but others make it later,\r\nno names being given in either case. Louis Hennepin gives the earliest\r\ndescription of the river: \"The strait (De troit) is finer than Niagara,\r\nbeing one league broad, excepting that part which forms the lake that\r\nwe have called St. Clair.\" The strait once voyaged and understood, its\r\nvalue was quickly appreciated by the French as a means of resisting the\r\ninroads of the persevering English (who from New York and New England\r\nwere pressing upon their possessions in the East), and of preventing\r\nBritish interference with the valuable hunting privileges or with\r\nthe Indian tribes dwelling upon the borders of the Northern lakes.\r\nWith this in view the Marquis de Nonville, Governor-General of the\r\nCanadas, ordered (June 6, 1686) M. Du Lhut, who had been commandant at\r\nMichilimackinac, \"to establish a post on the Detroit, near Lake Erie,\r\nwith a garrison of fifty men,\" and the order added, \"I desire you to\r\nchoose an advantageous place to secure the passage, which may protect\r\nour savages who go to the chase, and serve them as an asylum against\r\ntheir enemies and ours.\" In obedience to these instructions, M. Du Lhut\r\nproceeded to the entrance of the strait from Lake Huron, where he built\r\na fort and established a trading post (on the site of the present Fort\r\nGratiot) which he called Fort St. Joseph. Thus (1686) was made the\r\nfirst settlement by Europeans in the lower peninsula of Michigan.\r\n\r\nThe misfortunes of the war with England which terminated with the peace\r\nof Ryswick (Sept. 1, 1697,) still further convinced the most sagacious\r\nof the leading French colonists of the importance of a fort on the\r\nDetroit river which would command this channel of communication with\r\nthe great lakes above. Impressed with this fact, Antoine de la Mothe\r\nCadillac, a Gascon sailor who amid a career of romantic adventure came\r\nto be commandant at Michilimackinac, crossed the Atlantic in person,\r\nand earnestly and repeatedly pressed upon the colonial minister, Count\r\nPonchartrain, the necessity of the prompt establishment of a permanent\r\npost on the Detroit, where it would bring the French forces in closer\r\nproximity to the Iroquois and would give them command of the waters\r\nof the upper lakes and of the great fur trading regions about them.\r\nCadillac did not urge this as a missionary enterprise but for its\r\ncommercial and military advantages, and the force and vigor of his\r\nrepresentations prevailed at the palace. He sailed from France with the\r\nroyal order, \"Take prompt possession of Detroit,\" with this supplement\r\nfrom Ponchartrain: \"Prosecute vigorously; if the Jesuits obstruct,\r\nreturn and report.\" Cadillac arrived in Quebec early in the first year\r\nof the eighteenth century (March 8). Three months later (June 5) his\r\npreparations were made, and on that day he took his departure from La\r\nChine. With him were Captain Tonti, Lieutenants Dugue and Chacornacle,\r\nfifty soldiers, and fifty Canadian traders and artisans. Nineteen days\r\nlater he arrived upon the site of the present city of Detroit. In his\r\nmemoir Cadillac wrote: \"I arrived at Detroit, July 24 (1701), and\r\nfortified myself there immediately. I had the necessary huts made and\r\ncleared up the ground preparatory to its being sowed in the autumn.\"\r\nWhen he touched the shore of Michigan, with pomp and ceremony he\r\nerected a cross, a cedar post beside it; then with a sword in one hand\r\nand a sod in the other he made solemn proclamation with many words of\r\n\"possession taken\" of all the country round about, from the great lakes\r\nto the south seas, in the name of the King of France.\r\n\r\nThus French Michigan began, and so it remained until Wolfe's victory\r\ngave new rulers to Canada and to all the French possessions beyond.\r\nOn Nov. 29, 1760, the French flag floated for the last time over\r\nDetroit, as a part of the dominion of France. On that day Maj. Robert\r\nRogers, an English provincial officer, native of New Hampshire, took\r\npossession in the name of another king, ran up the Cross of St. George,\r\nfired a salute, gave some round British cheers, and (the Treaty of\r\nParis confirming this occupation) Michigan was English. It so remained\r\nuntil the Revolution and the treaty of 1783 made it American. But\r\nit was not until thirteen years after (1796) that it was evacuated\r\nby the British garrison; in June of that year Captain Porter with a\r\ndetachment of American troops entered the fort and hoisted the Union\r\nflag for the first time, and took formal possession in the name of the\r\nUnited States. The Hull surrender again swept Detroit and that part of\r\nMichigan lying within its command under the Cross of St. George (Aug.\r\n16, 1812,) to remain until Perry's victory and the subsequent military\r\nsuccesses of General Harrison expelled the English and restored it\r\npermanently to the Union, on Sept. 28, 1813. During the Revolution\r\nDetroit was the headquarters of British power in the Northwest, and\r\nfrom it were sent out the expeditions which ravaged the frontiers of\r\nPennsylvania and Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe British captain, Rogers, who took possession in 1760, afterwards\r\nreported the population (1765) as: Able-bodied men, 243; women, 164;\r\nchildren, 294--total, 701. This was exclusive of the garrison, who\r\nwere sent away as prisoners of war, and included the 60 men, women and\r\nchildren who were slaves. He also reported that of the French families\r\nremaining in the settlement there were 23 men able to bear arms, 24\r\nwomen, and 41 children. The others were probably English who had\r\nfollowed upon the track of the troops. Captain Rogers's report gives\r\nstrength to this supposition. It says: \"There are in the fort many\r\nEnglish merchants, several of whom have bought houses.\" Then it gives\r\nthis insight into the industrial condition of the settlement: \"Of farms\r\nthere are 40, and some fourscore acres in depth with a frontage on\r\nthe river; of these several farms are at present in cultivation.\" The\r\nnumber of acres under cultivation is given as 404; number of bushels\r\nof wheat raised the preceding year, 670; bushels of corn, 1,884. The\r\nreport quaintly adds: \"The Indian corn would have been in greater\r\nabundance, had proper care been taken of it; the most part has been\r\ndevoured by birds.\"\r\n\r\nHere remote from the world, with the joyous sparkling of the great\r\nriver at their feet, the luxuriance of the forest about them, the\r\ncottages of the settlers peeping out from the green foliage in which\r\nthey were half hidden, these simple colonists lived uneventful lives,\r\nsurrounded by the beauty and the bounties of nature. The forests teemed\r\nwith game, the marshes with wild fowl, and the rivers with fish. The\r\nlong winters were seasons of enjoyment. In summer and autumn traders,\r\nvoyageurs, _coureurs des bois_, and half-breeds gathered from the\r\ndistant Northwest, and the settlement was boisterous with rude frolic\r\nand gaiety. This was Detroit and Michigan in 1765.[3]\r\n\r\nBetween the French surrender and American occupancy, little was done\r\ntoward the development of the peninsulas. In 1796 there were a few\r\nstraggling settlements on the Detroit river, as also on Otter creek\r\nand on the rivers Rouge, Pointe aux Tremble, and other small streams\r\nflowing into Lake Erie. The French Canadians had extended their farms\r\nto a considerable distance along the banks of the St. Clair. Detroit\r\nwas a small cluster of rude wooden houses, defended by a fort, and\r\nsurrounded by pickets. Villages of the Ottawas and Pottawatamies stood\r\non the present site of the city of Monroe, and near them were a few\r\nprimitive cabins constructed of logs, erected by the French on either\r\nbank of the river Raisin; this was called Frenchtown, and is now part\r\nof Monroe. On the upper lakes there were the posts on the island of\r\nMackinac, at St. Marie, and at St. Joseph (on the St. Joseph river).\r\nThe transition from France to England  had given the monopoly of the\r\nfur trade to the Hudson Bay Company, thus changing the direction of\r\nits profits; otherwise the effect upon Michigan had been a change of\r\nmasters, flag and garrison, and little else. And the shifting from\r\nEngland to the United States also meant only new faces and new colors\r\nin the fort; otherwise it was for the time effectless.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the country was but little known except to those\r\nengaged in the fur trade, and they were interested in depreciating\r\nits value. Even as late as 1807 the Indian titles had only been\r\npartially extinguished, and no portion of the public domain had been\r\nbrought into the market. The opposite shore was occupied by a vigilant\r\nand jealous foreign power. The interior of the future State swarmed\r\nwith the savages who yet made it their home, and an Indian war was\r\nthreatening. These things repelled the tide of immigration that was\r\nalready surging over Ohio and the country bordering on the Ohio river.\r\nFourteen years after American possession the population of Michigan\r\nwas given as: Whites, 4,384; free blacks, 120; slaves, 24--total,\r\n4,528. Five years before the number of householders in the lower\r\npeninsula was officially given as 525. There are antecedent estimates\r\nof population and assertions, but no facts that can be relied on. It\r\nis, however, probable that at the time of the British evacuation (1796)\r\nthe population did not exceed 2,500 souls, for two years afterwards\r\n(1798) Wayne county, then co-extensive with the present State of\r\nMichigan, sent a representative to Chillicothe, where it was claimed\r\nthat the Northwest Territory was entitled to a delegate in Congress\r\nbecause there were then 5,000 inhabitants within its boundaries. It can\r\nscarcely be possible that half of that aggregate was in Michigan alone,\r\nand that its settlers then equaled in numbers those scattered over\r\nthe inviting and fertile region which now includes the powerful and\r\npopulous States of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the decade succeeding 1810 was trifling. In 1820 the\r\ncensus showed but 9,048 souls in Michigan Territory, which included\r\nthe present State and the region beyond the lakes north of Illinois.\r\nThe war was over. Indian depredations had ceased and the Indian titles\r\nhad been quieted. The perils of settlement were removed. The seeming\r\nobstacles of the toil and privations of frontier existence were mere\r\ncobwebs in the way of the hardy and adventurous. But there yet remained\r\nserious impediments to Michigan's growth. Distance was one, for the\r\nState was still difficult of access, and canals and railroads were yet\r\nin the future. A more serious impediment was a blunder. On May 6, 1812,\r\nCongress passed an act requiring that 2,000,000 acres of land should\r\nbe surveyed in Michigan Territory. The surveyors went into the forest\r\nwith their chains and poles, and the result was a report to Congress\r\nwhich may be thus summarized: \"Many lakes of great extent; marshes\r\non their margins; marshes between; other places covered with coarse\r\nhigh grass; this grass covered with water from six inches to three\r\nfeet; lakes and swamps over half the country; the intermediate space\r\npoor, barren and sandy; the dry land composed of sand-hills, with deep\r\nbasins between and more water; the margins of many of the streams and\r\nlakes literally afloat, or thinly covered with a sward of grass with\r\nwater and mud underneath; the country altogether so bad that there\r\nwould not be more than one acre out of a hundred, if there would be\r\none out of a thousand, that would in any case admit of cultivation.\"\r\nOfficial stupidity had its effect on Congress, and in 1816 (April 29)\r\nthat body cancelled the survey order, and abandoned Michigan to the\r\nhunters and trappers and their game. For two years this continued;\r\nbut the adventurous would plunge into the wilderness and would come\r\nback and talk of beautiful valleys, broad prairies and fertile soils.\r\nExplorations widened and a multitude of witnesses came with their facts\r\nto prove that the curtain of forest concealed something more inviting\r\nthan marsh and barren and sand-hill. Then the government (1818) ordered\r\na new survey and out of all this came part of the truth, namely: There\r\nwas in this wilderness an immense variety of forest trees--oak, maple,\r\nash, elm, sycamore, locust, butternut, walnut, poplar, whitewood,\r\nbeech, hemlock, spruce, tamarack, chestnut, white, yellow, and Norway\r\npine. There were plains and natural parks; there were level prairies\r\nand hills rising with gradual swell away to the center of the State.\r\nOf soils there were deep sandy loams mixed with limestone pebbles,\r\ndeep vegetable moulds mingled with clay producing dense and luxuriant\r\nvegetation, brown loams mingled with clay, deep vegetable moulds with a\r\nsurface covering of black sands. There was water in abundance, rivers\r\nand streams and creeks and beautiful lakes. All these reports and more,\r\nconfirmed and re-confirmed by pioneers and surveyors, came back from\r\nthe interior, until the exceeding richness and great agricultural value\r\nof the Lower Peninsula of Michigan was established.\r\n\r\nBut another event was to exercise a most important influence upon the\r\nfuture State. In 1817 the first steamer upon the Northern lakes, the\r\n\"Ontario,\" was launched, and, amid bonfires, illuminations and most\r\nlively demonstrations of joy, made her first trip upon Lake Ontario.\r\nThis heralded the dawn of a material revolution. One year later, on the\r\n27th day of August, 1818, the \"Walk-in-the-water,\" the first steamer\r\nlaunched above Niagara Falls, came up to the wharves of Detroit after\r\na passage of forty-four hours from Buffalo. This vessel, of only 340\r\ntons, and lost three years later, was a puny affair, but wise men\r\nsaw in her advent the promise of a future which time has more than\r\nrealized. Then in the wake of the steamer, Congress (1819) ordered\r\nthe public lands of Michigan placed in the market for sale. At this\r\ntime Detroit contained 250 houses, 1,415 inhabitants, and the entire\r\nterritory a population of 8,896. In 1825 the Erie canal was completed,\r\nand its far-sighted projector, De Witt Clinton, sailed amid national\r\nacclamations from Lake Erie to tide-water. It completed the link of\r\ndirect water communication with Michigan, and the stream of Western\r\nemigration was quickly swollen to a torrent.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler first came to Michigan in 1833. Three years before (1830)\r\nthe census of the entire territory, as it was constituted when Illinois\r\nwas admitted to the Union, was 32,531. The growth during the preceding\r\ndecade had been steady, not immense; that was to come after. It was\r\nin the year of 1833 that the first settlement was made in the present\r\nState of Iowa. And in that fall (September) the people of Detroit were\r\nrejoicing that \"arrangements were in train for the establishment of a\r\nnew stage-line route to Chicago, by which travelers can go from one\r\nplace to the other in five days.\" There was not then a mile of railroad\r\nin the territory, and not until five years after (1838) was the first\r\ntwenty-nine miles completed to Ypsilanti. Detroit was still a frontier\r\npost numbering less than 4,000 inhabitants. On all the Western lakes at\r\nthe beginning of that year there were but eighteen steamers, ranging\r\nfrom fifty to 395 tons in burden, and aggregating but 3,710 tons, and\r\nwith the best of these a voyage of thirty-nine hours from Buffalo to\r\nDetroit was a remarkable passage. All this was improvement; yet the\r\nDetroit merchant in that year could not expect to receive his purchases\r\nmade in New York within less than from three to six months after the\r\ntime of setting out to procure them. During the winter steamboats and\r\nriver craft were ice-bound, and the settlements at Detroit, the River\r\nRaisin and elsewhere throughout the broad peninsula, were shut out from\r\nthe Eastern world, except as travelers braved the tedious and painful\r\nstaging through Canada to Buffalo, with its week of continuous day and\r\nnight journeying.\r\n\r\nA year later (1834) Congress defined the boundaries of Michigan\r\nTerritory. Let the finger trace on the atlas the northern borders\r\nof Ohio and Indiana, follow around the south shore of Lake Michigan\r\nto the boundary between Wisconsin and Illinois, pursue that line to\r\nthe Mississippi river, then down its stream to the north line of the\r\nState of Missouri, along that westward to the Missouri, and up that\r\nriver until between the 25th and 26th degrees of west longitude the\r\nfinger reaches the faint line, coming down into the Missouri from the\r\nnorth, of the White Earth river--all the land and lakes between the\r\nDetroit straits and this little White Earth river and between the\r\nline so traced and the British possessions, was Michigan Territory in\r\n1834 and until Michigan was admitted as a State into the Union. It\r\nwas an imperial domain, larger than Sweden and Norway united; nearly\r\nthree times greater than England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, and the\r\nChannel islands; surpassing the united territories of France, Belgium,\r\nSwitzerland, Denmark and The Netherlands; even exceeding the combined\r\nacreage of Italy and the German Empire. Yet in all this region, when\r\nMr. Chandler displayed his first stock of goods in Detroit, there\r\nwas not one mile of railroad or telegraph, not one steam mill or\r\nmanufactory, but one city approaching 4,000 inhabitants and not one\r\nexceeding it, and not a single mile of paved street or sewerage. There\r\nwas but one water-works, and no gas-works. There was not one daily\r\nnewspaper, and but few of any kind. The valuable iron deposits of\r\nthe Upper Peninsula were undiscovered. The wealth of pine timber was\r\nunknown. In the previous year (1832) the total value of foreign and\r\ndomestic produce exported from Michigan amounted to but the trifling\r\nsum of $9,234, and in the preceding federal census (1830) the entire\r\ncivilized population of this vast area of limitless possibilities was\r\nless than 33,000, although there were then in the Union twenty-four\r\nStates with a population of 12,866,020.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DETROIT TN 1834.]\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler came in with the first swell of the great tide of\r\nemigration which broke over Michigan Territory. Up to within a brief\r\nperiod preceding, that extensive and fertile region was scarcely known\r\nexcept as it appeared on maps. Its rich prairies, its fertile plains,\r\nits deep forests with all their wealth, were a _terra incognita_ to all\r\nwhite men except the fur traders. But it was being rapidly known and\r\nunderstood. Its fame had rolled back over the East, and the fruits were\r\nseen in the new faces and sturdy forms swarming to Detroit as a point\r\nof departure to the new and beautiful land. In that year (1833) it was\r\na matter of boasting that as many as \"one hundred and seventy-five\r\nemigrants had landed in Detroit in one day.\" The next year _Niles'\r\nRegister_ had a report from Detroit that the arrivals had reached the\r\nmagnificent proportions of \"nine hundred and sixty in one day,\" and\r\nthat \"the streets of Detroit were full of wagons loading and departing\r\nfor the West,\" principally for the region about Grand river. And the\r\nsame journal said: \"The character of these emigrants is in every\r\nrespect a subject of felicitation. They will give Michigan a capital\r\nstock of wealth and moral worth unequaled by any of the newly-formed\r\nStates, and scarcely approximated by Ohio.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1833 and for more than a year afterward the business part of Detroit\r\nwas confined to the narrow space bounded by Wayne and Randolph streets,\r\nJefferson avenue and the river, and at the same time there were but few\r\nbuildings on Jefferson avenue above Rivard, and but one on Woodward\r\navenue north of State street. Old wind-mills lined the shores; the\r\nlittle unsightly French carts clattered through the streets; ducks,\r\ngeese and pigs were the only city scavengers. This sounds like another\r\nage--another continent--but it was the Detroit and Michigan of but\r\nforty-six years ago. Change came with population--slowly at first, then\r\nwith increased speed, then with immense strides. Mr. Chandler lived\r\nto see it all and to be a part of it. He came with the early tide\r\nof population; he saw the tide rising, at first languid, halting and\r\nuncertain; he saw it year by year gathering momentum and volume until\r\nit swelled and rolled over Michigan a mighty flood of brawn and brain,\r\nof enterprise and conscience.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day of November, 1879, tens of thousands of people looked\r\nupon the dead face of the stalwart Senator and followed his body to\r\nits last resting place in the city to which he had come in 1833.\r\nForty-six years and a few weeks had passed; no more. But in that time\r\nthe city which he made his home had spread its wings until it covered\r\nan area of thirteen and a half square miles, with 300 miles of streets\r\n(seventy-six miles paved), and some of them among the broadest and\r\nmost beautiful in the world, shaded by rows of graceful trees of\r\nluxuriant foliage, and adorned by stores and private residences rich\r\nin finish and architecture. It had 200 miles of water-mains and 150\r\nmiles of sewers, making it one of the most perfectly-drained cities\r\non the continent. Its population had grown to be 120,000, and its\r\ntaxable wealth to exceed $87,000,000. School buildings, representing\r\na public investment of $650,000 and accommodating 15,000 pupils, were\r\nscattered through its wards, and numerous churches and abundant public\r\nand private charitable institutions made proclamation of the faith and\r\nphilanthropy of its citizens. Great manufacturing enterprises lined its\r\nwharves and suburbs; scores of railroad trains arrived at and departed\r\nfrom its depots daily; and the commerce of the lakes was passing along\r\nits river front at the rate of thousands of tons hourly.\r\n\r\nBut the change in Michigan had been no less marvelous. The State\r\nhas a representation in the present Congress of the United States\r\nexceeding that of any one of eight of the first States of the\r\nUnion, equaling the representation of that of two others (Georgia\r\nand Virginia), and only exceeded by that of three of the original\r\nthirteen--Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania. In a single\r\ncounty of the Upper Peninsula, in 1833 supposed to be only a mass of\r\nbarren, uninviting and uninhabitable rocks, there are three cities\r\neither one of which has a greater population than the Detroit of that\r\nday, and in Michigan out of its forty-three cities and 178 villages\r\n(April, 1879) there are over thirty more populous than Detroit in\r\n1833--some of them with populations from five to eight times greater.\r\nThe people of the State are a million and a half in number, spread over\r\nthe greater part of the Lower Peninsula, about the Sault, and from\r\nMarquette to Ontonagon and south to Menominee in the Upper Peninsula.\r\nIts newspapers have grown to twenty-three dailies and over 300 with\r\nless frequent issues. Its railroads have developed from non-existence\r\nto 3,500 miles, owned by thirty-six corporations, connecting Detroit\r\nand the principal cities of Michigan with all portions of the State,\r\npenetrating to every center of population and industry, costing over\r\n$160,000,000, and paying in each year for salaries and operating\r\nexpenses over $13,000,000. Strong institutions for the care of the\r\ndeaf and dumb and the blind and for the insane, a thriving college\r\nfor agricultural education, and that noblest monument of the wisdom\r\nand forethought of the latter-day founders of Michigan, the State\r\nUniversity, were all planted in these years. And with this, the public\r\nschool system was nourished until there are over 300 graded schools and\r\nover 6,000 public schools in the State, with property valued at over\r\n$9,000,000, paying almost $2,000,000 yearly in teachers' wages, and\r\nwith annual resources amounting to nearly $4,000,000. In the mountains\r\nof the Upper Peninsula, so long reputed a barren wilderness, have been\r\ndiscovered exhaustless mines of the richest iron ores and the most\r\nextensive and valuable copper deposits known on the globe. The Saginaw\r\nValley has poured a briny stream of wealth upon the State from its\r\nunfailing salt-wells, and from the forests about and beyond to the\r\nwesternmost limits of Michigan have been gathered great treasures of\r\npine and hard woods. And while nature was yielding its hidden stores\r\nto enrich the State its skilled citizens were not idle. Over 10,000\r\nmanufacturing establishments in Michigan now employ upward of 70,000\r\npeople, pay more than $25,000,000 annually in wages, make an infinite\r\nvariety of wares, and turn out products each year amounting in value\r\nto more than $130,000,000. The statistics of agricultural development\r\nare equally remarkable. The log cabin and the clearings have yielded\r\nto ample farms. The marsh, the pine barren, even the hyperborean\r\nsoil of the Upper Peninsula, have been transformed into productive\r\nwheat-fields. The cereals of Michigan exceed in their annual product\r\n70,000,000 bushels, and $45,000,000 in their value. Highly cultivated\r\nand valuable farms (over 111,000 in number and with a total acreage of\r\n10,000,000) cover the greater part of the Lower Peninsula. Comfortable,\r\neven stately, farm houses dot the landscape. School-houses, churches,\r\nvillages, towns and cities stand where the forest was. The wilderness\r\nhas fled away. Everywhere there are evidences of peace, prosperity,\r\nhappiness and a high civilization. It is magic; courage, intelligence\r\nand industry have been the magicians.\r\n\r\nThe changes in the other parts of the Michigan Territory of 1833 have\r\nbeen no less marvelous. Four States have been carved out of that\r\nregion whose boundaries in 1834 were traced on the atlas--Michigan,\r\nWisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota--and the great wheat farms of Dakota\r\nwill soon develop into a fifth. This entire territory to-day has eight\r\nSenators, twenty-nine Representatives and one Delegate in Congress,\r\nhas over 11,000 miles of railroad, seventy-seven daily papers and over\r\n1,100 weekly or monthly publications, and several great cities larger\r\nthan Philadelphia and New York when the United States had taken its\r\nsecond census. It has a population greater than that of the thirteen\r\ncolonies which successfully defied the power of Great Britain during\r\nthe Revolution, greater than that of the six New England States in\r\nthe present day. It produces a larger amount of breadstuffs than the\r\nwhole Union yielded when Mr. Chandler first came to the territory, and\r\ncontains more wealth than did all the States fifty years ago.\r\n\r\nThis is a marvelous story of growth. Nothing in the Old World has\r\nequaled it. Nothing the New has exceeded it. It has confounded\r\nprophecy. It has outrun imagination. It is the achievement of a\r\nstalwart race. It is the triumph of faith, of zeal, of courage. It\r\ndazzles the men of to-day. And it will stand for centuries to excite\r\nthe admiration of the historian and the wonder of the future.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] Parkman's \"Jesuits in North America.\"\r\n\r\n[3] This is Parkman's picture in \"The Conspiracy of Pontiac.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMENCEMENT OF POLITICAL ACTIVITY--RECORD AS AN ANTI-SLAVERY WHIG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conspicuous figure in Michigan politics, when Zachariah Chandler\r\nlanded at Detroit and for twenty-five years afterward, was Lewis Cass.\r\nHe was a man of ability and many accomplishments, irreproachable in\r\nprivate life, and with a claim upon the enduring gratitude of the\r\npeople of the Northwest for his large share in the founding of mighty\r\nStates about the shores of the great lakes. He came to Michigan with\r\nmilitary distinction, and had added to his laurels civic honors as a\r\nterritorial ruler, as a skilful negotiator with the Indians, and as\r\nan intrepid explorer. General Cass was a warm political and personal\r\nfriend of Andrew Jackson, and his influence made Michigan a strongly\r\nDemocratic territory and State. In 1831 he had been appointed Secretary\r\nof War in President Jackson's cabinet, and in 1836 he was sent to Paris\r\nas the United States Minister at the court of Louis Phillippe. The\r\ncourage, vigor and skill of his attack upon the \"Quintuple Treaty,\"\r\nwhich embodied Great Britain's theories on the then delicate topic of\r\nthe right of search on the high seas, and which was defeated by the\r\nrefusal of France to ratify the preliminary negotiations, made his\r\nambassadorship an event in European diplomacy, and gave him a national\r\nreputation on this continent. His return to Detroit in 1843 was\r\nattended by unusual popular demonstrations at every important point in\r\nhis Westward journey. In 1845 Michigan sent him to the Senate, and in\r\n1848 the Democracy nominated him as its candidate for the presidency.\r\nThat a man who thus made a new commonwealth influential in national\r\npolitics should call about him a strong following and mould public\r\nsentiment at his own home was natural, and the State of Lewis Cass was\r\nlong regarded as staunchly Democratic. His party held control for years\r\nof the main avenues of political preferment, and not a few young men\r\nof parts and ambition who came to Michigan as Whigs were led into the\r\nranks of the Democracy by the fact that it was the only organization\r\nwhich had honors and offices to bestow.\r\n\r\nGeneral Cass was a courtly gentleman, dignified in manners, who, with\r\na natural boldness of character which never lost wholly its power of\r\nself-assertion, gradually became ultra-conservative in his Democracy.\r\nOriginally he had anti-slavery tendencies, but the Southern drift\r\nof his party, which became apparent about the time of his return\r\nfrom France, carried him with it, and he grew to be one of the most\r\nassiduous originators and supporters of the series of compromises\r\nwhich so long defeated justice and encouraged the aggressions of the\r\nslave power. The result was that in time the hammer of his personal\r\ninfluence in Michigan was broken on the anvil of New England ideas,\r\nwhile his name became the symbol of \"hunkerism\" in the Northwest;\r\nbut in December, 1860, his octogenarian patriotism flamed up in the\r\npresence of armed treason and executive imbecility, and he branded\r\nthe administration of James Buchanan as it deserved by indignantly\r\nresigning the portfolio of the department of state. No political\r\ncontrast could well be more vivid than that between Lewis Cass and the\r\nman who succeeded him in the Senate, and replaced him in the political\r\nleadership of Michigan, representing a greater State, a nobler\r\npolitical cause, and instead of the make-shifts of compromise ideas\r\nwhich are to-day embodied in the fabric of American civilization.\r\n\r\nZachariah Chandler's father was originally a Federalist, and then\r\na Whig. The son brought with him to Detroit Whig sympathies and\r\nanti-slavery convictions, but no predisposition to political activity.\r\nFor many years he refused to divert his energies from his mercantile\r\npursuits, and took no share in party contests, except such as would be\r\nnatural in the case of any enterprising citizen with a lively interest\r\nin public questions. He was known as a staunch Whig, and he thoroughly\r\nidentified himself with that party when in both Michigan and the Union\r\nits victories seemed accidental, and its defeats certain. Between\r\n1837 and 1848 his name frequently appears among the officers of Whig\r\nmeetings, or as a member of the election day vigilance committees of\r\nhis party, and (very rarely) as a ward delegate to Whig conventions. He\r\nwas a regular contributor to the campaign fund, and he did his share\r\nof work at the polls. At that time the labors of election day were not\r\nthose of persuasion merely. Partisan feeling was bitter, and in the\r\npopulation of the growing frontier city, there was a strong ruffianly\r\nelement, which was as a rule Democratic in its sympathies. In close\r\ncontests mobs sometimes gathered about the voting places, and sought\r\nby jostling and occasional assaults to keep away from the ballot-boxes\r\nthe more timid or fastidious of the Whigs. On these occasions Mr.\r\nChandler was among the men of strong frames, sinewy arms, and pugnacity\r\nof spirit, who furnished the Whig muscle to defeat this variety of\r\n\"Loco-foco trick.\" He and Alanson Sheley (now a well-known Detroit\r\nmerchant) were, with a few others of like strength and stature, the\r\nWhig body-guard who forced a way for voters through the dense crowd,\r\nand interposed for the rescue of the threatened. There is no lack of\r\namusing anecdotes of this species of service rendered by Mr. Chandler\r\nto the Whig party; and it was at times attended by serious danger. In\r\nlater years he credited Mr. Sheley with having saved his life in one of\r\nthese election disturbances, and frequently recalled reminiscences of\r\nthe muscular exploits of those days. It was not until Mr. Chandler was\r\na Whig of nearly twenty years' standing, that he became that party's\r\ncandidate for any office, or that he actively interested himself in\r\nits committee work and practical management. He cast a void vote for\r\nHarrison in 1836, before Michigan had been formally admitted; he\r\nattended the monster meetings and sang campaign songs in the log cabins\r\nof 1840, and gave then a valid vote to Harrison; he denounced Tyler's\r\npolitical treason, and in 1844 cheered for Clay and Frelinghuysen; he\r\nopposed General Cass in 1848, and at that time delivered his maiden\r\nspeech, in support of \"Zach.\" Taylor; but it was not until 1851 that\r\nhe manifested any especial taste for or skill in politics, or that he\r\nallowed his name to be used as a candidate for position.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs of Michigan were as a rule of New England extraction, and the\r\nmasses of the party were always staunchly anti-slavery in sentiment.\r\nThey charged General Cass's denunciation of the \"Quintuple Treaty\" to\r\na disposition to seek Southern approval by indirectly shielding the\r\nslave trade: they opposed the annexation of Texas, applauded the Wilmot\r\nProviso, and were restive under Southern aggression and slaveholding\r\narrogance at the capital. The few Congressmen whom they were able to\r\nelect voted uniformly for free institutions and against the extension\r\nof human bondage. Michigan's first Whig Senator, Augustus S. Porter,\r\nwhile still new in his seat, opposed alone Calhoun's resolutions in\r\n\"the Enterprise case\" (a vessel employed in the coastwise slave trade\r\nhad touched at Port Hamilton in the British West Indies, and some\r\nnegro chattels who formed part of her cargo had taken advantage of\r\nEnglish law to assert their manhood and freedom), and cast a solitary\r\nvote to lay them upon the table. Of this act Joshua R. Giddings wrote:\r\n\"Seeing that eminent Senators around him interposed no objection to\r\nthe passage of the resolutions, Mr. Porter, obeying the dictates of\r\nhis own judgment and conscience, heroically met the overwhelming\r\ninfluence arrayed against him, and showed the most cogent reasons for\r\nrejecting the resolutions, by exhibiting the absurdity of the attempt\r\nto induce the British government to acknowledge the laws of slavery\r\nand the slave trade to exist and be enforced within her ports.\" Both\r\nMr. Porter and William Woodbridge voted against the resolution for the\r\nannexation of Texas. In the House of the Twenty-seventh Congress Jacob\r\nM. Howard acted with the friends of freedom on questions involving\r\nthat issue, and in the Thirtieth Congress William Sprague, the second\r\nWhig Representative, was openly classified as a Free Soiler. In 1849\r\nthe Whigs and Free Soilers united to support Flavius J. Littlejohn\r\nfor Governor, and the Whigs of Michigan as a whole were a body of\r\nintelligent and conscientious anti-slavery men, and made their\r\npolitical weight felt on the side of free institutions.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler was from his boyhood radical in his opposition to human\r\nbondage, and for a time hoped that the Whig party of the North could be\r\nused to effectually resist the conspiracy of the slave power against\r\nthe territories. His anti-slavery activity preceded his appearance\r\nin politics. Detroit was an important terminus of the \"Underground\r\nRailroad,\" that mysterious organization which so skilfully and quietly\r\ntransported colored fugitives from the Ohio to Canadian soil, and Mr.\r\nChandler, while still absorbed in business, was a frequent and liberal\r\ncontributor to the fund for its operating expenses. He manifested an\r\nespecial interest in the Crosswhite case, which, played a conspicuous\r\npart in the fugitive slave law agitation preceding the compromises of\r\n1850. Adam Crosswhite was the mulatto son of a slave mother who was\r\nowned by his father, a white farmer in Bourbon county, Kentucky. While\r\na boy he was given as a servant to his half-sister, a Miss Crosswhite,\r\nwho married a slave-dealer named Stone. Her husband subsequently sold\r\nher brother for $200, and Crosswhite ultimately became the chattel\r\nof a Kentucky planter named Giltner living in Carroll county. When he\r\nhad reached the age of forty-four and had become the father of four\r\nchildren, he learned that his master was planning to sell a portion of\r\nhis family. The parental instinct drove this man to a step which he had\r\nnot taken through any desire for personal freedom, and he determined\r\nupon flight. He succeeded in getting his entire family across the Ohio\r\nin a skiff, and into the hands of the \"Underground Railway\" managers\r\nin Indiana. There was a vigorous pursuit, and at Newport the fugitives\r\nwere nearly captured, but Quaker shrewdness concealed and protected\r\nthem, and after weeks of stirring adventure, during which the father\r\nand mother were compelled to separate, they reached Michigan, and\r\nbecame the occupants of a little cabin in the eastern part of the\r\npresent city of Marshall. They were quiet and industrious citizens,\r\nand by thrift and unremitting labor commenced making payments on\r\ntheir homestead. In time the history of the fugitives became known\r\nto their neighbors, and finally some one with the genuine spirit\r\nof the slave-driver sent to Kentucky information concerning their\r\nhiding-place. In December, 1846, Francis Troutman came to Marshall,\r\nostensibly as a young lawyer in search of business, but in fact as\r\nGiltner's representative in identifying his fugitive slaves and\r\nplanning their recapture. He did his work well, through artifice and\r\nwith the help of aid which he hired at Marshall, but did not succeed\r\nin perfectly concealing his plans. Crosswhite received warning of the\r\nimpending danger, and both armed himself and arranged with sympathizing\r\nfriends for prompt assistance. The abduction was finally attempted\r\nearly on the morning of Jan. 27, 1847. Troutman was assisted by David\r\nGiltner, Franklin Ford, and John S. Lee, all Kentuckians, and the four\r\nmen were well armed. Crosswhite saw their approach, and succeeded in\r\ngiving the alarm, but before his friends commenced to assemble the\r\nKentuckians broke in the door of his cabin and informed the negroes\r\nthat they must go at once before a magistrate where it was proposed\r\nto prove the fact of their escape from slavery. While the preparation\r\nof the children for the winter's ride to the justice's office was in\r\nprogress, a crowd, at first largely composed of colored men but soon\r\nincluding many whites, gathered about the cabin, and promptly made\r\nthe fact apparent that they were in no mood to permit the proposed\r\nrestoration of human property to its Kentucky owners. The courage of\r\nthe slave-hunters did not prove equal to the occasion, and finally\r\nTroutman resorted to argument. He harangued the jeering crowd on the\r\nsanctity of the fugitive slave law and the legality of Giltner's\r\nclaim, even offering as proof of his law-abiding spirit not to take\r\nback to slavery a child born to the Crosswhites since their escape.\r\nThe response to this proposition to do exact justice by separating an\r\ninfant from its mother may be imagined, and in the end the Kentuckians\r\nabandoned their attempt. Crosswhite had meanwhile complained against\r\nthem for trespass, and they were then arrested, convicted and fined\r\n$100. Money was also at once raised in Marshall by which the negroes\r\nwere sent to Detroit and thence to Canada. While the excitement was\r\nat its hight some of the prominent citizens of Marshall joined the\r\ncrowd, and endeavored to restrain them from violence and to convince\r\nthe slave-hunters of the folly of attempting to defy the aroused\r\nindignation of the community; they were careful, however, to avoid any\r\nviolation of the law. Troutman met their remonstrances by a demand\r\nfor their names. One of them replied, \"Charles T. Gorham; write it in\r\ncapital letters.\" The answer of another was, \"Oliver Cromwell Comstock,\r\nJr.; take it in full so that my father may not be held responsible\r\nfor what I do.\" Troutman also obtained the name of Jarvis Hurd, these\r\nthree being well-known residents of Marshall and gentlemen of pecuniary\r\nresponsibility. Nothing further took place at the time, and in a few\r\ndays the Kentuckians returned to their State, which was soon aflame\r\nwith wrath at this \"Northern outrage.\" Public meetings were held to\r\ndenounce the \"abolition rioters,\" the most exaggerated accounts of\r\nthe Marshall release were circulated and believed, the event received\r\nCongressional attention, and finally the State of Kentucky made an\r\nappropriation for the prosecution of all who were concerned in the\r\nescape of the Crosswhite family. Troutman returned to Michigan in the\r\nsummer of 1847, and brought an action to recover the value of the\r\nrescued slaves, in the United States Circuit Court, against a large\r\nnumber of defendants; the case as tried, however, was practically a\r\nprosecution of Messrs. Gorham, Comstock, and Hurd. The Kentuckians\r\nretained a large array of counsel, including John Norvell, the veteran\r\nDemocratic leader, while the defense was represented by Theodore\r\nRomeyn, Wells & Cook, and Hovey K. Clarke, with Halmer H. Emmons\r\n(subsequently United States Circuit Judge) and James F. Joy as counsel.\r\nGerrit Smith also came from New York to argue the constitutional\r\nquestion involved, but the defendants' attorneys did not deem it\r\nprudent in a jury trial at that time to ally themselves with so radical\r\nan abolitionist. The case was taken up before Justice John MacLean,\r\nin 1848, and attracted national attention. The first trial took place\r\nin the June term and resulted in a disagreement of the jury. A second\r\ntrial followed in November and December of the same year and ended\r\nin a verdict for the plaintiffs of $1,926 and costs; the expenses of\r\ndefending the suits had also imposed heavy pecuniary burdens upon the\r\nMarshall gentlemen. Mr. Gorham was then a Democrat, and found among his\r\nparty friends a strong feeling that it was important at that time and\r\nin so conspicuous a case that Michigan should manifest a disposition to\r\nrigidly enforce the fugitive slave law, as these were the years when\r\nGeneral Cass's presidential aspirations culminated, and when it was\r\nessential that his hold upon Southern confidence should be preserved.\r\nThere was no lack of private expressions of Democratic sympathy with\r\nthe defendants, and assurances were given that they should not be left\r\nto meet alone the heavy expenses involved, but among the Democratic\r\nleaders there was an unmistakable wish that the prosecution should\r\nbe vigorously pushed for the sake of its political effect, and this\r\nsecret pressure had a powerful influence. This case interested Mr.\r\nChandler from the outset, and he watched every development closely.\r\nEarly in the proceedings he met Mr. Gorham, with whom his acquaintance\r\nwas then but slight, and said to him, \"I am satisfied from what I have\r\nseen and learned that this case is being manipulated in the interest\r\nof the Democratic party, and that you are to be sacrificed to appease\r\nthe slave power of the South, so that Cass may not be damaged by the\r\nresult. Offer no compromise; fight them through to the end; I will\r\nstand by you, and see that you do not suffer.\" He was as good as his\r\nword, gave and helped to raise money for the defense, and attended\r\nthe trial to the close. Mr. Gorham, who received no Democratic aid of\r\nimportance, became one of his firmest and most intimate friends, and\r\nwhen Mr. Chandler was appointed Secretary of the Interior Mr. Gorham\r\n(who had then served five years as United States Minister at The Hague)\r\nbecame the Assistant Secretary of that department. Of the same period\r\nof Mr. Chandler's life this characteristic anecdote is told: John\r\nSumner, one of his Jackson customers, passed Sunday as his guest in\r\nDetroit, and at church listened with him to a sermon of pro-slavery\r\nflavor, followed by a prayer by a visiting clergyman in which the\r\nDivine blessing was earnestly invoked upon the down-trodden and the\r\noppressed. At the conclusion of the services Mr. Chandler stepped to\r\nthe foot of the pulpit, sought an introduction to the utterer of the\r\nprayer, and said: \"Thank you for that prayer! It was all that I have\r\nheard this morning that was worth hearing.\" Throughout the days of\r\nMr. Chandler's earnest attachment to the Whig party, his anti-slavery\r\nfeeling was pronounced.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 Mr. Chandler fleshed his political broadsword with one\r\nor more speeches in behalf of General Taylor. He had been an\r\noccasional participant in the debates of the Young Men's Society,\r\nthe training-school for not a few of Detroit's eminent men, but in\r\nthat year for the first time he addressed a miscellaneous audience\r\non public questions. His earlier speeches showed the strength of the\r\nman, and despite some ruggedness were effective. In the State election\r\nof 1849 Mr. Chandler took no active part. In 1850 he was one of the\r\nWayne county delegates to the Whig State convention, which met at\r\nJackson on the 18th of September, and nominated a ticket headed by\r\nGeorge Martin, of Kent, for Secretary of State; the following campaign\r\nwas a local one, arousing but little interest, and in it Mr. Chandler\r\ndid not prominently share. On February 19, 1851, the Whigs of Detroit\r\nheld a convention to select a city ticket for the charter election\r\nin March, and after one informal ballot Mr. Chandler was unanimously\r\nnominated by them for Mayor. This event marks the commencement of his\r\ncareer as a popular, shrewd, and successful political leader. The\r\nDemocratic candidate for the Mayoralty was Gen. John R. Williams, a\r\nnative and one of the foremost citizens of Detroit, the president of\r\nthe Michigan constitutional convention of 1835, and the senior officer\r\nof the State militia. He had been the first Mayor of the city, and had\r\nheld that place for six terms, and was a man of practical ability, the\r\nowner of a large estate, and popular with the people. His personal\r\nstrength made him a formidable candidate, and his defeat not easy of\r\naccomplishment. Mr. Chandler's answer to the delegation who waited\r\nupon him with the question, \"Will you run on the Whig ticket against\r\nJohn R. Williams?\" was, \"I will and I will beat him too,\" and he put\r\nall his energy into the campaign which followed. The Whig convention\r\nby resolution presented his name to the people of Detroit as that of\r\n\"a man identified with its improvements, prominent in its welfare, and\r\ninterested in its prosperity,\" and in the Whig journals he was warmly\r\ncommended as \"known to every man, woman, and child in the city as a\r\nman of strict integrity, active and industrious business habits, of\r\ngreat liberality of views, both in person and sentiment, and of the\r\npurest moral character; eminently popular and affable in his habits of\r\nintercourse with his fellow-citizens, his extensive business operations\r\nhave brought him in daily contact with all, through a long course of\r\nyears.\" His election was also urged on the ground that he was the only\r\ncandidate \"known to be in favor of extending the various enterprises\r\nof sewerage, pure water, pavements and sidewalks, just as fast as the\r\nneeds of a young city shall require,\" and because his \"course in his\r\nown business, and in relation to the public interest, has been an\r\nenergetic, discreet and efficient prosecution of everything upon which\r\nhe has laid his hands.\" During this canvass Mr. Chandler gave what is\r\nbelieved to be the only lecture of his life, and its marked success\r\nundoubtedly helped him at the ballot-box. It was delivered before\r\nthe Young Men's Society upon February 25, 1851, its theme being \"The\r\nElement of Success in Character.\" The newspaper report of it was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  The theme chosen by Mr. Chandler. \"The Element of Success in\r\n  Character,\" though much worn, was most successfully treated.\r\n  Intending only to discourse from his own observations and\r\n  experience, his views were as philosophical as they were practical.\r\n  Therein was the charm and _takingness_ of the lecture. Without\r\n  rhetorical flourish the composition was excellent, severe in its\r\n  simplicity and directness, nevertheless abounding in beauty. For\r\n  originality, aptness of quotation and illustration, and felicitous\r\n  use of language, it ranks with the choicest productions before the\r\n  society. In his own person he furnished the very best illustration\r\n  and proof of success. Such a lecture from any one would do good,\r\n  but how much greater its influence when enforced by the living\r\n  example the lecturer himself affords of the truths of his teaching.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler organized his first political battle with characteristic\r\nthoroughness and system, visited every ward, called upon the voters,\r\nand made a remarkable personal canvass. The result was that when the\r\nballots were counted it was found that he had carried every precinct\r\nin Detroit and had defeated his opponent by 349 majority in a total\r\nvote of less than 3,500. He led by nearly 400 the average vote of his\r\nticket, and the Democrats elected at the same time a large proportion\r\nof their candidates. The victory was celebrated by a Whig serenade,\r\nat which the Mayor-elect made a modest and brief speech of thanks.\r\nThis manifestation of personal strength and political skill at once\r\nattracted State attention, and it became the source of new Whig hope.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler's term as Mayor continued for one year, but was devoid of\r\nespecial incident, although even now some interest will be felt in this\r\nofficial letter to Kossuth, which the Hungarian patriot answered with a\r\nnote of regretful declination:\r\n\r\n                                      DETROIT, January 10, 1852.\r\n\r\n  _To his Excellency Louis Kossuth_:\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR: By resolution of the Common Council, it becomes my\r\n  pleasing duty to invite you to visit the city of Detroit and\r\n  partake of its hospitalities. Much as we esteem you personally,\r\n  highly as we appreciate your public and private worth, it is not\r\n  to these alone that we do homage, but to the great principles\r\n  which you advocate. We hail you as the champion of republicanism\r\n  in Europe, as God's instrument in arousing throughout the world\r\n  a hatred of despotism, as a man who has sacrificed his all, and\r\n  offers his life upon the altar of liberty, as a teacher of \"even\r\n  bayonets to think.\" We, sir, have not been disinterested spectators\r\n  of your glorious struggle for Hungarian independence. We watched\r\n  with most intense interest the commencement and progress of that\r\n  sanguinary conflict. When we saw the people rising in their might,\r\n  the nobleman and citizen vieing with each other in devotion to\r\n  their country's cause, emulous in sufferings and sacrifices, under\r\n  such a leader, we felt that victory must crown your exertions;\r\n  and when we saw the elements of Despotism uniting to crush this\r\n  (to them) detested spirit of Freedom, when we saw the temporary\r\n  triumphs of your oppressors, we felt that all was not lost--that\r\n  the Almighty Ruler of the Universe would neither leave nor forsake\r\n  you in your low estate, that the days of despotism were numbered.\r\n\r\n  Again would I invite you to visit Detroit and partake of its\r\n  hospitalities. Again would I assure you of our deep sympathy for\r\n  your down-trodden country, and I hazard nothing by the assertion\r\n  that that sympathy will manifest itself in a tangible form. Whether\r\n  our government will act in your behalf as a government, is not for\r\n  me to say; whether it would be proper for it to do so, is not for\r\n  me to discuss at this time. But that you have the deep sympathy of\r\n  our entire population is manifest to all.\r\n\r\n  With great respect, I have the honor to be your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n  ZACHARIAH CHANDLER,\r\n         _Mayor of the City of Detroit_.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of Mr. Chandler's term as Mayor the Common Council of\r\nDetroit, by unanimous vote, spread upon its records this resolution:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved by the Common Council of the City of Detroit_, That in\r\n  retiring from the office of chief magistrate of this city the\r\n  Hon. Zachariah Chandler, by his urbanity, fidelity and zeal in\r\n  the discharge of his official duties for the past year, merits\r\n  the admiration and respect of the Council, and that in retiring\r\n  to private life he carries with him our cordial wishes for his\r\n  happiness and prosperity.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1852, occurred Michigan's first general election under\r\nthe constitution of 1850. The Democratic candidate for Governor\r\nwas Robert McClelland, who had already held that office during the\r\npreceding short term. General Cass alone surpassed this gentleman in\r\npersonal strength with his party in the State. Mr. McClelland was an\r\nupright and able man, who had served with distinction in Congress, and\r\nhad held many important offices in Michigan; he subsequently became\r\nSecretary of the Interior in the cabinet of President Pierce. While\r\na member of the House of Representatives he had assisted in drafting\r\nthe original Wilmot Proviso, but he had grown conservative with his\r\nparty, and in 1852 came before the people as a warm champion of the\r\ncompromises of 1850. Personally he was a man of some reserve, but\r\naffable with acquaintances and respected everywhere. He was renominated\r\nenthusiastically and with every prospect of an easy re-election.\r\nWith the single exception of William Woodbridge, who was borne into\r\noffice on the Whig tidal-wave of 1839 and 1840, Michigan had chosen\r\nan unbroken line of Democratic Governors. At the first election after\r\nits admission to the Union, Stevens T. Mason had a majority of 237 in\r\na total poll of 22,299. The term for which Governor Woodbridge was\r\nchosen (he resigned to take a seat in the Senate) was followed by six\r\nsuccessive Democratic victories. John S. Barry was elected in 1841\r\nwith 5,326 majority over his Whig competitor, Philo C. Fuller, and two\r\nyears later he defeated Dr. Zina Pitcher by 6,493 votes. Alpheus Felch\r\nin 1845 had 3,807 majority over Stephen Vickery, Whig, and in 1847\r\nEpaphroditus Ransom was chosen over James M. Edmunds by 5,649 votes. In\r\n1849 John S. Barry was again elected, defeating Flavius J. Littlejohn,\r\nWhig and Free Soiler, by 4,297 votes in a total poll of 51,377. In\r\n1851, which was the last election under the old constitution, Robert\r\nMcClelland led Townsend E. Gidley 6,926 votes. The Liberty party, as a\r\ndistinct organization, also existed six years in Michigan, beginning\r\nin 1841 with 1,214 votes and ending in 1847 with 2,585. Thus from 1841\r\nto 1852 not only did the Democrats control Michigan but at every State\r\nelection had a clear majority over all shades of opposition.\r\n\r\nIn 1852 the chronic difficulties of the Whig situation in Michigan\r\nwere aggravated by the fact that the Baltimore convention which\r\nnominated Scott and Graham had condemned that anti-slavery sentiment\r\nof the party, which gave it all its virility in the West. The greater\r\nportion of the Northern Whigs with Mr. Greeley supported the ticket\r\nand \"spat upon the platform,\" but some of them abandoned old party\r\naffiliations and joined the Free Soil Democrats, who put up Hale and\r\nJulian as their national candidates and in Michigan nominated a full\r\nState ticket headed by Isaac P. Christiancy. The Whig State convention\r\nof 1852 met at Marshall on July 1, and was called to order by Henry T.\r\nBackus as chairman of the State Central Committee, and presided over by\r\nCyrus Lovell of Ionia. In the preliminary consultations Mr. Chandler's\r\nwas the name chiefly urged for the head of the ticket, on account of\r\nhis acquaintance throughout the State and the political strength and\r\ncapacity he had shown as a candidate in Detroit. This is an extract\r\nfrom the official record of the convention:\r\n\r\n  On motion of W. A. Howard of Detroit a ballot was taken for\r\n  Governor and was announced by the tellers as follows:\r\n\r\n  Z. Chandler,         76\r\n  H. G. Wells,          7\r\n  G. A. Coe,            2\r\n  H. R. Williams,       1\r\n  J. R. Williams,       1\r\n  George R. Pomeroy,    2\r\n\r\n  On motion of Mr. DeLand of Jackson a formal ballot was had as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n  Z. Chandler,         95\r\n  H. G. Wells,          2\r\n  J. R. Williams,       1\r\n  Blank,                1\r\n\r\n  Mr. Chandler was not present and inquiry was made if it was known\r\n  whether he would accept the nomination. Mr. Wm. A. Howard of\r\n  Detroit, chairman of the delegation from that city, said on the\r\n  part of that delegation that he had seen Mr. Chandler previous to\r\n  leaving Detroit, and Mr. Chandler had said to him that he was not\r\n  a candidate for any of the offices under consideration, that he\r\n  preferred working in the ranks, but that should the convention see\r\n  fit to nominate him he was with them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Temperance Ticket.=\r\n\r\n  For Governor,\r\n  Zachariah Chandler.\r\n\r\n  For Lieut.

Roberts.\r\n\r\nFAC-SIMILE OF ONE OF THE STATE TICKETS OF MICHIGAN IN 1852.]\r\n\r\nThe result was hailed with hearty cheering, and Mr. Chandler soon\r\nformally accepted this nomination and commenced a most energetic\r\npersonal canvass of the State. The Temperance party made up a ticket in\r\nthat year from the Democratic and Whig candidates, and Mr. Chandler was\r\nalso retained as its nominee for Governor, but this action was without\r\npractical importance in the campaign or at the polls. During the fall\r\nof 1852 the Whig nominee for Governor labored unremittingly. He visited\r\nall the leading towns in the State, and spoke constantly from the\r\nmiddle of September until the week before election. The list of his\r\nappointments included Jonesville, Coldwater, Constantine, Cassopolis,\r\nHowell, Lansing, Eaton Rapids, Hastings, Allegan, Grand Rapids, Ionia,\r\nDeWitt, Corunna, Flint, Saginaw, Lapeer, Almont, Romeo, Mt. Clemens,\r\nAnn Arbor, Jackson, Marshall, Battle Creek, St. Clair, and Detroit. His\r\naddresses were vigorous, entertaining and telling, and while he neither\r\nthen nor afterward sought for the polished sentence or rounded period,\r\nhe showed that capacity for plainness and force of reasoning and for\r\nhard-hitting which ultimately made his oratory so characteristic\r\nand effective. In this series of speeches he dealt largely with the\r\nnational questions of Protection and Internal Improvements, and also\r\nwith the business aspects of the State administration. His friends\r\nlaid especial stress upon his strength as \"a business man of energy,\r\nintegrity and success,\" and urged his election because he bore \"the\r\nreputation, well earned by a long course of business experience, of\r\nbeing a keen and shrewd business man of the highest moral tone,\" and\r\nbecause he was \"endowed with remarkable business talent,\" and had\r\nbeen \"identified with the growth and interests of the State.\" Mr.\r\nChandler was also helped in this contest by his mercantile friendships\r\nthroughout Michigan, and by the natural pleasure with which his fellow\r\nmerchants saw one of their own guild fighting his way to political\r\ndistinction along the paths so largely occupied by men of professional\r\ncallings. As part of the organization of this canvass he mailed large\r\nquantities of gummed \"slips\" bearing his name to acquaintances in all\r\nparts of the State, and this is believed to be the first instance\r\nin which this now common weapon of political warfare was used in\r\nthe Northwest. The Democrats found themselves compelled by this\r\nunprecedentedly vigorous attack to put forth most strenuous efforts,\r\nand General Cass labored assiduously to prevent the loss of his own\r\nState. So pronounced did the opposition of the veteran Democratic\r\nleader to the head of the Whig ticket become, that Mr. Chandler\r\nlaughingly said to friends by way of comment upon it, \"I am afraid that\r\nit will take General Cass's Senatorial seat to balance the account\r\nbetween us.\"\r\n\r\nBut the national tide was then overwhelmingly against the Whigs,\r\nand Southern distrust of General Scott and Northern wrath at the\r\ncircumstances of his nomination brought that party to the Waterloo\r\ndefeat from which it never recovered. Michigan cast 41,842 votes for\r\nPierce, 33,859 for Scott, and 7,237 for Hale. Mr. Chandler received\r\n34,660 votes for Governor against 42,798 for McClelland, and 5,850 for\r\nChristiancy. He thus received 801 more votes than Scott; he also led\r\nthe entire Whig State ticket by from 500 to 4,000 votes, and received\r\nover 11,000 more votes than had ever been given to any Whig candidate\r\nfor Governor. He had made a resolute fight, and again strikingly\r\nmanifested his personal strength with the people and his political\r\nability.\r\n\r\nIn the Michigan Legislature of 1853, which was chosen at the same\r\nState election, the Democrats had a majority on joint ballot of\r\nforty-eight, and the Whig minority included but seven Senators and\r\ntwenty-one Representatives. The term of Alpheus Felch as United States\r\nSenator expired on March 3, 1853, and Charles E. Stuart was chosen\r\nas his successor. The Whigs gave expression to their high estimate\r\nof the value of Mr. Chandler's services in the preceding campaign\r\nby complimenting him with their united vote for the Senate, and the\r\nfootings of the Legislative ballot for that office were:\r\n\r\n  SENATE.\r\n  C. E. Stuart,    27\r\n  Z. Chandler,      7\r\n\r\n  HOUSE.\r\n  C. E. Stuart,    49\r\n  Z. Chandler,     21\r\n  H. K. Clarke,     1\r\n\r\nThis was the last important political action of the Whig party of\r\nMichigan. Before another State election its formal dissolution had been\r\npronounced, and the great body of its members had gathered around the\r\ncradle of infant Republicanism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE FORMATION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe darkest hour for the anti-slavery cause preceded the dawn of 1854.\r\nThe compromises of 1850 had closed that long series of so-called\r\nbargains, by which the South had forced surrender after surrender\r\nfrom the North in the vain hope of preserving by such artificial\r\ndevices its traditional preponderance in the government, so constantly\r\nthreatened by the rapid development of the free States and the\r\nmarvelous settlement of free territory. Behind the Louisiana purchase\r\nfrom Bonaparte was slavery's demand for new States to reinforce\r\nits political strength. Florida was bought from Spain for the same\r\nreasons. The Missouri compromise of 1820 involved the admission of a\r\nnew slave State to the Union, and the organization of Arkansas as a\r\nslave territory; it was the work of the advocates of slavery extension,\r\nand was practically a surrender of free territory to bondage, the\r\nonly consideration being the exclusion of slavery from soil on which\r\n(judging from all the experience of American settlement up to that\r\ntime) it could not be established nor maintained. The annexation of\r\nTexas had been forced to add to the Union an enormous expanse of slave\r\nterritory, capable, it was hoped, of early division into several slave\r\nStates. The Mexican War was a peculiarly Southern scheme, having as\r\nits real aim the conquest of an empire which was to include human\r\nbondage among its established institutions. The futile plans for\r\nthe annexation of Cuba came from the same prolific source, and were\r\ninspired by the same need of forcing the expansion of the political\r\npower of the slave South to prevent its being outstripped by the\r\nmagnificent growth of the free North. But the forces of nature prove\r\nmore potent than human devices, and the last speech of John C. Calhoun\r\n(read for him in the Senate on March 4, 1850,) showed how clearly this\r\nfact had impressed itself on the ablest and acutest of the Southern\r\nstatesmen. That farewell address sketched minutely the history and\r\ncondition of the steadily-growing disparity between the North and the\r\nSouth, declared in effect that the South with its institutions could\r\nnot permit Northern ascendancy, demanded from the North constitutional\r\namendments \"which would restore to the South in substance the power\r\nshe possessed of protecting herself before the equilibrium between the\r\nsections was destroyed,\" added that on no other basis could the South\r\nsafely remain in the Union, and said that, if this demand was refused,\r\n\"we would be blind not to perceive that your real objects are power and\r\naggrandizement, and infatuated not to act accordingly.\" To this candid\r\navowal of the Southern programme (ten years later it became evident\r\nthat Mr. Calhoun had stated then the slave power's ultimatum) the\r\nanswer was the final surrender of 1850. The compromise measures of that\r\nyear pledged the United States to the subdivision of Texas into new\r\n(slave) States, organized Utah and New Mexico without any prohibition\r\nof slavery within their boundaries, forbade the abolition of slavery in\r\nthe District of Columbia, and set the odious machinery of the Fugitive\r\nSlave law in operation throughout the North. The consideration Freedom\r\nreceived for these concessions was the admission of California to the\r\nUnion (it was evident that nothing but invasion and conquest could ever\r\nmake it a slave State) and the abolition of the slave trade in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, amounting to a removal of the auction blocks of\r\nslave dealers from the shadow of the Capitol to the narrow streets of\r\ndecaying Alexandria.\r\n\r\nThe opiate of compromise sufficed to keep still dormant the conscience\r\nof the North, and the national acquiescence in this adjustment was\r\nemphatic. The Whig and the Democratic parties in 1852 both formally\r\naccepted in their platforms the legislation of 1850 as a decisive\r\nand just settlement of the slavery question, and they polled almost\r\n3,000,000 votes, while for the Free Soil ticket, representing hostility\r\nto slavery extension and to pro-slavery compromises, but 155,000\r\nvotes were cast. The victory of the Democrats, who embodied in much\r\nthe fullest degree the spirit of concession to Southern demands,\r\nwas an overwhelming one. They carried 27 out of the 31 States, and\r\nhad 254 electoral votes out of 296, with a clear popular majority\r\nover the entire opposition. In the Senate they had 14 majority out\r\nof a membership of 62, and in the House a majority of 84 in a total\r\nmembership of 234. The condition of public sentiment then is thus\r\ndescribed by the most accurate and graphic historian of that era:\r\n\r\n  Whatever theoretic or practical objections may be justly made to\r\n  the compromise of 1850, there can be no doubt that it was accepted\r\n  and ratified by a great majority of the American people, whether\r\n  in the North or in the South. They were intent on business--then\r\n  remarkably prosperous--on planting, building, trading and getting\r\n  gain--and they hailed with general joy the announcement that all\r\n  the differences between the diverse \"sections\" had been adjusted\r\n  and settled. The terms of settlement were, to that majority, of\r\n  quite subordinate consequence; they wanted peace and prosperity,\r\n  and were no wise inclined to cut each other's throats and burn each\r\n  other's houses in a quarrel concerning (as they regarded it) only\r\n  the _status_ of negroes. The compromise had taken no money from\r\n  their pockets; it had imposed upon them no pecuniary burdens; it\r\n  had exposed them to no personal and palpable dangers; it had rather\r\n  repelled the gaunt spectre of civil war and disunion (habitually\r\n  conjured up when slavery had a point to carry), and increased\r\n  the facilities for making money, while opening a boundless vista\r\n  of national greatness, security and internal harmony. Especially\r\n  by the trading class, and the great majority of the dwellers in\r\n  seaboard cities, was this view cherished with intense, intolerant\r\n  vehemence.... Whatever else the election of 1852 might have meant,\r\n  there was no doubt that the popular verdict was against \"slavery\r\n  agitation\" and in favor of maintaining the compromises of 1850....\r\n  The finances were healthy and the public credit unimpaired.\r\n  Industry and trade were signally prosperous. The tariff had ceased\r\n  to be a theme of partisan or sectional strife. The immense yield of\r\n  gold in California during the four preceding years had stimulated\r\n  enterprise and quickened the energies of labor, and its volume as\r\n  yet showed no signs of diminution. And though the Fugitive Slave\r\n  law was still denounced, and occasionally resisted by abolitionists\r\n  in the free States, while disunionists still plotted in secret and\r\n  more openly prepared in Southern commercial conventions (having for\r\n  their ostensible object the establishment of a general exchange\r\n  of the great Southern staples directly from their own harbors\r\n  with the principal European marts, instead of circuitously by way\r\n  of New York and other Northern Atlantic ports) there was still a\r\n  goodly majority in the South, with a still larger in the North and\r\n  Northwest, in favor of maintaining the Union and preserving the\r\n  greatest practical measure of cordiality and fraternity between the\r\n  free and slave States, substantially on the basis of the compromise\r\n  of 1850.\r\n\r\nThis was the blackest chapter in the history of the agitation for\r\nFreedom on this continent. The era seemed to have been at last reached\r\nof national surrender to slavery's demands, and of the purchase\r\nof peace by the abandonment of (with the promise never to resume)\r\nresistance to \"the sum of all villainies.\" John Quincy Adams had said\r\nthat up to his day \"the preservation, propagation, and perpetuation\r\nof slavery\" had ever been \"the animating spirit\" of the American\r\ngovernment. Daniel Webster had bitterly declared in 1848 that there was\r\nno North in American politics, and that the South absolutely controlled\r\nthe government. Certainly, in 1853, the surface of the political\r\nsituation fully justified the indignant words of Gerrit Smith: \"Were\r\nthis government despotic and her religion heathen, there might be some\r\nhope of republicanizing her politics and Christianizing her religion;\r\nbut now that she has turned into darkness the greatest of all political\r\nlights and the greatest of all religious lights, what hope is left for\r\nher?\"\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture, when its triumph appeared to be complete, that\r\nslavery fatally overreached itself. The Missouri compromise of 1820,\r\nwhich _forever_ prohibited slavery in all of the original Louisiana\r\nterritory north of 36 degrees, 30 minutes of north latitude, had\r\nremained unquestioned upon the statute books for a generation. The\r\nSouth had received the full benefits of its share of that bargain,\r\nwhich added Arkansas and Missouri to the ranks of the slave States. In\r\nthe interminable discussions of 1850 there had been no suggestion that\r\nthe compromise measures of that year were intended to either disturb\r\nor supersede the Missouri compact, and the first message of Franklin\r\nPierce congratulated the country on the sense of repose and security\r\nin the public mind which the compromise measures had restored, and\r\nadded the pledge, \"this repose is to suffer no shock during my official\r\nterm, if I have power to avert it.\" Before two months had elapsed,\r\nthe North heard with astonishment and indignation the doctrine laid\r\ndown in Congress by the representatives of the slave power that the\r\nMissouri compromise had been abrogated by the measures of 1850, and\r\nthat the vast domain between the Missouri and the Rocky Mountains, rich\r\nin all material and political possibilities, was open to slaveholding\r\nsettlement. A few days more passed, and it was discovered that this\r\nclaim was receiving the powerful support of the administration, and\r\nthat it would also be championed by Stephen A. Douglas, with his\r\nformidable energy, personal influence, and rare skill in debate, as a\r\nstep towards the vindication of his dogma of \"Popular Sovereignty.\" Of\r\nthe memorable four months' struggle over this issue, the following is a\r\nsketch in outline:\r\n\r\nSoon after the Thirty-third Congress assembled, in December, 1853,\r\nSenator A. C. Dodge, of Iowa, introduced a bill to organize the\r\nTerritory of Nebraska out of the magnificent region between Missouri\r\nand Iowa and the Rocky Mountains. It was referred to the Committee on\r\nTerritories, and was reported back by Senator Douglas with amendments,\r\nnone of which, however, proposed to repeal the prohibition of slavery\r\nincluded in the Missouri compromise. Upon this, Senator Archibald\r\nDixon, of Kentucky, a Whig who declared that on the question of slavery\r\nhe knew no Whiggery and no Democracy, but was a pro-slavery man,\r\ngave notice that he should offer an amendment, providing that the\r\nact of 1820 should not be so construed as to apply to the territory\r\ncontemplated by this act, nor to any other territory of the United\r\nStates. Senator Douglas thereupon had the bill recommitted, and\r\nsubsequently reported in an entirely different form, creating _two_\r\nterritories, Kansas and Nebraska, instead of one, and including the\r\nprovision that all questions pertaining to slavery in the territories\r\nand in the new States to be formed therefrom should be left to the\r\naction of the people thereof through their appropriate representatives,\r\nand that the provisions of the constitution and laws of the United\r\nStates in respect to fugitives from service should be carried into\r\nfaithful execution in all the organized territories the same as in the\r\nStates. This was, equally with Senator Dixon's proposition, a direct\r\nviolation of the provision of the Missouri compromise, which was in\r\nthese words (Section 8): \"That in all that territory ceded by France\r\nto the United States under the name of Louisiana, which lies north of\r\n36 degrees and 30 minutes of north latitude, not included within the\r\nlimits of the State contemplated by this act, slavery and involuntary\r\nservitude, otherwise than as the punishment of crime, shall be and is\r\nhereby forever prohibited.\" In the last report, however, the pill was\r\nsugar-coated with Mr. Douglas's catch-word of \"Popular Sovereignty.\"\r\n\r\nThe territory which the Kansas-Nebraska bill was intended to organize\r\nwas included in this quoted prohibition. That bill as introduced, in\r\nthe section that provided for the election of a delegate to Congress\r\nfrom Kansas, had the stipulation:\r\n\r\n  That the constitution and all laws of the United States, which are\r\n  not locally inapplicable, shall have the same force and effect\r\n  within said territory as elsewhere in the United States.\r\n\r\nTo this the amended bill added the following reservation:\r\n\r\n  Except the section of the act preparatory to the admission of\r\n  Missouri into the Union, approved March 6, 1820, which was\r\n  superseded by the principles of the legislation of 1850, commonly\r\n  called the compromise measure, and is declared inoperative.\r\n\r\nA similar provision with a like reservation was added to the section\r\nproviding for the election of a delegate from Nebraska. A prolonged and\r\nbrilliant debate followed in the Senate, and finally in place of the\r\noriginal reservation the following was adopted, on motion of Senator\r\nStephen A. Douglas, by a vote of 35 to 10:\r\n\r\n  Except the section of the act preparatory to the admission of\r\n  Missouri into the Union, approved March 6, 1820, which, being\r\n  inconsistent with the principle of non-intervention by Congress\r\n  with slavery in the States and territories, as recognized by the\r\n  legislation in 1850 (commonly called the compromise measure), is\r\n  hereby declared inoperative and void, it being the true intent and\r\n  meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any territory or\r\n  State, nor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof\r\n  perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions\r\n  in their own way, subject only to the constitution of the United\r\n  States.\r\n\r\nSenator Chase then moved to add to the above the following:\r\n\r\n  Under which the people of the territory, through their appropriate\r\n  representatives, may, if they see fit, prohibit the existence of\r\n  slavery therein.\r\n\r\nThis amendment was voted down, yeas 10, nays 36, the Senate thus\r\ndeclaring its understanding that the people of the new territories\r\nshould _not_ be allowed to prohibit slavery previous to their admission\r\nas a State. The bill passed on the morning of March 4th, by a vote\r\nof 37 to 14. In the House a separate bill had been introduced, but\r\nwhen it came up for consideration the Senate bill was substituted for\r\nit--by a parliamentary trick its opponents were prevented from offering\r\namendments--and the bill was passed, yeas 113, nays 100. It went back\r\nto the Senate, in form as an original measure, but in effect the Senate\r\nbill, and on May 26 was finally passed by that body and was approved by\r\nPresident Pierce on May 30. The debate had been a memorable one; for\r\nthe friends of Liberty, while they resisted to the last the surrender\r\nof what had been once bought for Freedom, joyfully recognized the fact\r\nthat this act would in its logic make every compromise repealable,\r\nand thus kill in the womb all future political bargainings. Benjamin\r\nF. Wade said in the Senate that \"the violation of the plighted\r\nfaith of the nation would precipitate a conflict between liberty and\r\nslavery; and that, in such a conflict, it will not be liberty that\r\nwill die in the nineteenth century. You may call me an Abolitionist\r\nif you will; I care little for that, for if an undying hatred to\r\nslavery constitutes an Abolitionist, I am that Abolitionist. If man's\r\ndetermination at all times and at all hazards, to the last extremity,\r\nto resist the extension of slavery, or any other tyranny, constitutes\r\nan Abolitionist, I before God believe myself to be that Abolitionist.\"\r\nWilliam H. Seward said: \"You are setting an example which abrogates all\r\ncompromises.... It has been no proposition of mine to abrogate them\r\nnow; but the proposition has come from another quarter--from an adverse\r\none. It is about to prevail. The shifting sands of compromise are\r\npassing from under my feet, and they are now, without agency of my own,\r\ntaking hold again on the rock of the constitution. It shall be no fault\r\nof mine if they do not remain firm.\" Charles Sumner closed his protest\r\nagainst this removal of \"the landmarks of freedom\" by declaring the\r\nmeasure to be \"at once the worst and best bill on which Congress ever\r\nacted--the worst inasmuch as it is a present victory for slavery, and\r\nthe best bill because it prepares the way for the 'All hail hereafter,'\r\nwhen slavery must disappear. Sorrowfully I bend before the wrong you\r\nare about to perpetrate. Joyfully I welcome all the promises of the\r\nfuture.\"\r\n\r\nThe response of the North to the abrogation of the Missouri compromise\r\njustified these predictions. To this overthrow of a solemn compact\r\nfor the purpose of opening a vast empire to attempts at slave\r\ncolonization, men of every shade of anti-slavery conviction made\r\nanswer by eagerly seeking ways of uniting in effective resistance to\r\nsuch a crime against civilization. Amid an excitement, which grew\r\nprofounder as the contest progressed, and which was fed by the press,\r\nthe pulpit, and the lyceum, and was organized by public meetings,\r\nthe demand became daily stronger for political action on the basis of\r\nuncompromising hostility to the aggressions of the slave power. Before\r\nthe Kansas-Nebraska controversy was finished the Whig party had ceased\r\nto exist, the Democracy had become a pro-slavery organization, the era\r\nof compromise had passed away, and the young giant of Republicanism\r\nstood on the threshold of the territories commanding slavery to stand\r\nback. This vast and far-reaching political revolution was accomplished\r\nthrough the wholesale sacrifice of cherished ties by the friends of\r\nfree institutions and through their hearty union in the new party\r\nof Freedom. The State in which this fusion of anti-slavery opinion\r\ninto Republicanism was first accomplished was Michigan, and the\r\nRepublican party as a distinct organization was born and christened\r\nunder the oaks of Jackson on the 6th of July, 1854. Political opinion\r\nin that State was peculiarly ripe for this step. Its Whigs were with\r\nbut rare exceptions staunch anti-slavery men. Even Senator Cass's\r\ngreat influence had failed to keep all the Democrats submissive to\r\npro-slavery compromises. The Free Soilers were strong in character\r\nand several thousands in number. Thus when the opportunity came for\r\ndecisive action it found the men ready.\r\n\r\nThe Free Democrats of Michigan, encouraged by the increase in their\r\nvote in 1852, and responding to an appeal of the \"Independent Democrats\r\nin Congress\" (signed by Salmon P. Chase, Charles Sumner, Joshua R.\r\nGiddings, Gerrit Smith, Edward Wade, and Alexander De Witt) for popular\r\nresistance to the attack on the Missouri compact, held the first\r\npolitical convention of 1854 in that State. It met in Jackson, on\r\nFebruary 22d, under a call issued at Detroit on January 12, and signed\r\nby U. Tracy Howe, Hovey K. Clarke, Samuel Zug, Silas M. Holmes, S. A.\r\nBaker, S. B. Thayer, S. P. Mead, J. W. Childs, and Erastus Hussey,\r\nforming the state central committee of that party. The convention\r\nwas called to order by Hovey K. Clarke, and it organized with Wm.\r\nT. Howell of Hillsdale as president. The committee on resolutions\r\nconsisted of Hovey K. Clarke, Fernando C. Beaman, Kinsley S. Bingham,\r\nE. Hussey, Nathan Power, D. C. Leach, and L. Moore, and a committee of\r\ntwenty-four was appointed to nominate a State ticket. The committee on\r\nresolutions reported a platform prepared by Hovey K. Clarke, declaring\r\nfreedom national and slavery sectional, and denouncing the attempt to\r\nrepeal the Missouri compromise as an infamous outrage upon justice,\r\nhumanity and good faith. The nominating committee submitted this list\r\nof candidates for the State offices:\r\n\r\n                     Governor--Kinsley S. Bingham.\r\n                  Lieutenant-Governor--Nathan Pierce.\r\n                   Secretary of State--Lovell Moore.\r\n                   State Treasurer--Silas M. Holmes.\r\n                   Auditor-General--Philotus Hayden.\r\n                  Attorney-General--Hovey K. Clarke.\r\n          Commissioner of Land Office--Seymour B. Treadwell.\r\n       Superintendent of Public Instruction--Elijah H. Pilcher.\r\n          Member of Board of Education--Isaac P. Christiancy.\r\n\r\nKinsley S. Bingham was a pioneer farmer of Central Michigan, one of\r\nthe very best representatives of his influential class, and a man of\r\nsterling sense, strong convictions, and excellent abilities. He had\r\nserved with honor in the State Legislature, and had as a Democratic\r\nCongressman sustained alone in his State delegation the Wilmot\r\nProviso. His nomination was in itself the strongest possible appeal\r\nto the anti-slavery Democrats of the State. The ticket also had upon\r\nit the names of gentlemen who had in the past acted with the Whigs.\r\nThe convention ratified the reports of its committees, and after\r\nlistening to a few speeches adjourned. It was a significant fact that\r\ntwo of the speakers were conspicuous Whigs, Henry Barns of the Detroit\r\n_Tribune_, and Halmer H. Emmons; Mr. Emmons was especially emphatic\r\nin his expression of the hope that before the day of election \"all\r\nthe friends of freedom would be able to stand upon a common platform\r\nagainst the party and platform of the slave propagandists.\"\r\n\r\nCotemporaneously with this organized action of the Free Soilers, but\r\noutside of it and of all party lines, there were held many public\r\nmeetings throughout Michigan to denounce the Kansas-Nebraska act.\r\nSome of these were county conventions in form, and others were local\r\nmass-meetings. One of the latter took place at Detroit on the 18th of\r\nFebruary; Zachariah Chandler was among the many prominent citizens who\r\nsigned its call, and was one of the five speakers from its platform\r\n(the others were Jonathan Kearsley, Samuel Barstow, James A. Van Dyke,\r\nand D. Bethune Duffield). The tone of all the speeches was wholesomely\r\ndefiant, and this was also true of the resolutions adopted which were\r\nreported by a committee consisting of Samuel Barstow, Jacob M. Howard,\r\nJoseph Warren, James M. Edmunds, and Henry H. Le Roy. The effect of\r\nthis demonstration in the metropolis of the State upon public opinion\r\nwas marked, and it and like non-partisan action did much to pave the\r\nway for the fusion of July. Powerful contributions to the same movement\r\ncame also from the strong and growing current of sentiment in that\r\ndirection throughout the entire North, and from the significant results\r\nof many of the spring elections. Both New Hampshire and Connecticut\r\nelected anti-administration candidates in March and April, and in\r\nMichigan anti-slavery coalitions were successful in quite a number of\r\nmunicipal contests, notably in the important city of Grand Rapids which\r\nchose Wilder D. Foster mayor on that issue.\r\n\r\nThroughout the spring of 1854 many private conferences (Mr. Chandler\r\nsharing in them) were held in Michigan among representative men of\r\nthe Whigs, Free Soilers, and Anti-Nebraska Democrats to discuss the\r\nfeasibility of union and consider plans for its accomplishment. The\r\nearly action of the Free Soilers was in fact a practical obstacle in\r\nthe way. That party represented but a small element of the anti-slavery\r\nsentiment of Michigan, and neither the sincerity of its purpose, nor\r\nits tender of the olive branch by placing Whig names on its State\r\nticket, nor the soundness of its platform on the slavery question could\r\ncounterbalance the many reasons why the Whigs would not surrender\r\na time-honored organization and march bodily into the camp of what\r\nthey had always regarded as a faction of impracticables. There was\r\nalso much in the State situation to encourage Whig hope, for the\r\nparty there was almost solidly anti-slavery and certain to profit by\r\nthe weakening of the enemy through the revolt of the Anti-Nebraska\r\nDemocrats. But there was a vigor of principle and an intelligence of\r\nsentiment in the Whig party of Michigan which encouraged the belief\r\nthat it would not subordinate essentials to a name, and that it would\r\nassent to an anti-slavery union under conditions not involving any\r\nseeming self-degradation. In fact it was called upon to make the only\r\nreal sacrifice involved in the desired coalition. The Free Soilers\r\nwere powerless, and had nothing to lose and everything to gain in\r\nthe new movement; the Anti-Nebraska Democrats were condemned by, and\r\nwithout influence in, their own party; but the Whigs were strong\r\nin numbers, and were asked to surrender a historic name, honorable\r\ntraditions and reviving hope for a doubtful experiment. But that the\r\nhour demanded precisely this act of self-denial was clear, and men\r\nof resolution and principle grappled with the problem of making it\r\npossible. Altogether the most important work in that direction was done\r\nby Joseph Warren, editor of the Detroit _Tribune_, then an influential\r\nWhig paper, which began the publication in its columns of a series of\r\nvigorous and well-considered articles advocating the organization of\r\na new party composed of all the opponents of slavery extension. This\r\npolicy accorded with the drift of public opinion, and, involving as\r\nit did the disbanding of both the Whig and Free Soil organizations,\r\navoided any appearance of surrender and humiliation. Public and private\r\ndiscussion made its wisdom plainer, and the proof of its feasibility\r\nwas followed by steps for its accomplishment. An indispensable\r\npreliminary was the withdrawal of the \"Free Democrat\" ticket, as this\r\nwould remove the chief stumbling-block in the path of the anti-slavery\r\nWhigs. Mr. Warren, whose personal labors at this juncture were of the\r\nutmost value, writes with reference to the spirit with which the Free\r\nSoil leaders met the demand for this step:\r\n\r\n  One of the first and chiefest obstacles to be overcome in order to\r\n  ensure the co-operation of all the opponents of slavery extension\r\n  in the movement looking to the organization of a new party, was\r\n  to induce the Free Soilers to consent to the withdrawal of their\r\n  ticket from the field, thus placing themselves on the same footing\r\n  as the Whigs (who as yet had made no nominations), free from all\r\n  entangling alliances and in a position to act in a way likely to\r\n  prove most effectual. But formidable as this obstacle seemed to\r\n  be in the beginning, it was promptly removed through the wisely\r\n  directed and patriotic efforts of the prominent leaders of the\r\n  party. Such men as Hovey K. Clarke, Silas M. Holmes, Kinsley S.\r\n  Bingham, Seymour Treadwell, all on the Free Soil ticket, F. C.\r\n  Beaman, S. P. Mead, I. P. Christiancy, W. W. Murphy, Whitney Jones,\r\n  U. Tracy Howe, Jacob S. Farrand, Rev. S. A. Baker, proprietor,\r\n  and Rev. Jabez Fox, editor of the Detroit _Free Democrat_, were\r\n  especially active and influential in preparing the way for this\r\n  necessary preliminary step.\r\n\r\nThis readiness of the Free Soil leaders to make the sacrifices required\r\non their part bore prompt fruit. The Kansas-Nebraska bill was passed\r\nby the House on the 22d of May, and three days after a stirring call\r\nwas issued for a mass convention of the Free Democrats of Michigan at\r\nKalamazoo on June 21st. The village of Kalamazoo had long been a center\r\nof anti-slavery sentiment, and the agitation against the pending bill\r\nhad been especially vigorous there and in the surrounding counties.\r\nThe call was full of fiery denunciation of the slavery propagandists,\r\nand its vigor and _vim_ showed how thoroughly the people were aroused.\r\nThe convention itself, owing to bad weather and other inauspicious\r\ncircumstances, was not a large one, but its character and action were\r\nsignificant and important. Among those in attendance were four of\r\nthe candidates on the \"Free Democrat\" ticket, including Kinsley S.\r\nBingham. M. A. McNaughton was made president, and Hovey K. Clarke,\r\nfrom the committee for that purpose, reported a series of resolutions\r\nreviewing the disgraceful proceedings of the session of Congress,\r\ndenouncing the Kansas-Nebraska bill as the crowning act of a series of\r\naggressions by which slavery had become the great national interest\r\nof the country, and appealing to the virtue of the people \"to declare\r\nin an unmistakable tone their will that slavery aggression upon their\r\nrights shall go no further, that there shall be no compromise with\r\nslavery, that there shall be no more slave States, that there shall\r\nbe no slave territory, that the Fugitive Slave law shall be repealed,\r\nthat the abominations of slavery shall no longer be perpetrated under\r\nthe sanctions of the federal constitution, and that they will make\r\ntheir will effective by driving from every place of official power the\r\npublic servants who have so shamelessly betrayed their trust, and by\r\nputting in their places men who are honest and capable, men who will be\r\nfaithful to the constitution and the great claims of humanity.\" A final\r\nresolution directed the appointment of a committee of sixteen, two from\r\neach judicial district, to consult with others for the organization\r\nof a new party animated and guided by the principles expressed in\r\nthe resolutions, and it empowered that committee, in case of the\r\nestablishment of an \"efficient organization\" of such a character,\r\nto surrender the \"distinctive organization\" of the \"Free Democrats\"\r\nand withdraw the State ticket nominated on the 22d of February. This\r\naction, reached after a vigorous discussion, cleared the way for the\r\ncoalition.\r\n\r\nA few days before the meeting of the Kalamazoo convention, but after\r\nits probable course had become apparent, a call had appeared in the\r\ncolumns of the Detroit _Tribune_ (it was copied, after the Kalamazoo\r\naction, by the Detroit _Free Democrat_ also) for a mass-meeting at\r\nJackson, on July 6, of all the opponents of slavery extension. This\r\nwas signed by several thousand leading citizens of Michigan, in all\r\nparts of the State, including Zachariah Chandler, Jacob M. Howard, H.\r\nP. Baldwin, H. K. Clarke, Franklin Moore, John Owen, Jacob S. Farrand,\r\nShubael Conant, J. J. Bagley, E. B. Ward, R. W. King, James Burns,\r\nCharles M. Croswell, Allen Potter, Austin Blair, Isaac P. Christiancy,\r\nChas. T. Gorham, and others. The signatures filled two newspaper\r\ncolumns in close type, and it was announced on the last day that\r\nseveral hundred names had been received too late for publication. The\r\ntext of this document was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PEOPLE OF MICHIGAN.\r\n\r\n  A great wrong has been perpetrated. The slave power of this country\r\n  has triumphed. Liberty is trampled under foot. The Missouri\r\n  compromise, a solemn compact, entered into by our fathers, has been\r\n  violated, and a vast territory dedicated to freedom has been opened\r\n  to slavery.\r\n\r\n  This act, so unjust to the North, has been perpetrated under\r\n  circumstances which deepen its perfidy. An administration placed in\r\n  power by Northern votes has brought to bear all the resources of\r\n  executive corruption in its support.\r\n\r\n  Northern Senators and Representatives, in the face of the\r\n  overwhelming public sentiment of the North, expressed in the\r\n  proceedings of public meetings and solemn remonstrances, without\r\n  a single petition in its favor on their table, and not daring to\r\n  submit this great question to the people, have yielded to the\r\n  seductions of executive patronage, and, Judas-like, betrayed the\r\n  cause of liberty; while the South, inspired by a dominant and\r\n  grasping ambition, has, without distinction of party, and with\r\n  a unanimity almost entire, deliberately trampled under foot the\r\n  solemn compact entered into in the midst of a crisis threatening\r\n  to the peace of the Union, sanctioned by the greatest names of our\r\n  history, and the binding force of which has, for a period of more\r\n  than thirty years, been recognized and declared by numerous acts\r\n  of legislation. Such an outrage upon liberty, such a violation\r\n  of plighted faith, cannot be submitted to. This great wrong must\r\n  be righted, or there is no longer a North in the councils of the\r\n  nation. The extension of slavery, under the folds of the American\r\n  flag, is a stigma upon liberty. The indefinite increase of slave\r\n  representation in Congress is destructive to that equality between\r\n  freemen which is essential to the permanency of the Union.\r\n\r\n  The safety of the Union--the rights of the North--the interests of\r\n  free labor--the destiny of a vast territory and its untold millions\r\n  for all coming time--and finally, the high aspirations of humanity\r\n  for universal freedom, all are involved in the issue forced upon\r\n  the country by the slave power and its plastic Northern tools.\r\n\r\n  In view, therefore, of the recent action of Congress upon this\r\n  subject, and the evident designs of the slave power to attempt\r\n  still further aggressions upon freedom--we invite all our fellow\r\n  citizens, without reference to former political associations, who\r\n  think that the time has arrived for a _union_ at the North to\r\n  protect liberty from being overthrown and down-trodden, to assemble\r\n  in mass convention on Thursday, the 6th of July next, at 4 o'clock,\r\n  P. M., at Jackson, there to take such measures as shall be thought\r\n  best to concentrate the popular sentiment of this State against the\r\n  aggression of the slave power.\r\n\r\nThe response to this appeal was the gathering at Jackson, on a\r\nbright mid-summer day, of hundreds of influential men from all parts\r\nof Michigan, representing every shade of anti-slavery feeling, and\r\nthoroughly alive to the importance of the occasion and the difficulty\r\nof the task projected. The convention far outstripped in numbers the\r\npreparations for its accommodation, and, after filling to excess the\r\nlargest hall in the town, it adjourned to meet in a beautiful oak\r\ngrove, situated between the village and the county race-course, on a\r\ntract of land then known as \"Morgan's Forty.\" The growth of Jackson has\r\nsince covered this historic ground with buildings, and the spacious\r\ngrove has dwindled to a few scattered oaks shading the city's busy\r\nstreets. A rude platform erected for speakers was appropriated by the\r\nofficers of the convention, and about it thronged a mass of earnest\r\nmen, the vanguard of the Republican host. In a body so incongruous\r\nand unwieldy, confused purposes, discordant views, and conflicting\r\ninterests were unavoidable, but the universal fervor of the fusion\r\nsentiment formed a broad foundation for harmonious action, and the\r\nconvention did not lack for shrewd and sagacious political managers\r\nwith the skill to direct earnest effort into practical channels. Such\r\ndifferences of opinion as there were on questions of policy and as\r\nto candidates exhausted themselves in private conferences and secret\r\ncommittee deliberations, and the convention itself did its business\r\nwith promptness, without discord, and amid a genuine enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nIts temporary chairman was the Hon. Levi Baxter, of Jonesville, a\r\npioneer settler of Southern Michigan, and the founder of a family of\r\nmarked prominence in that State. He was well known as the master spirit\r\nof many important business enterprises, had been a Whig and then a Free\r\nSoiler, and had been elected to the State Senate by a local coalition\r\nof both those parties in his own county. After a brief address by\r\nMr. Baxter, Jeremiah Van Renselaer was chosen temporary secretary,\r\nand this committee on permanent organization was appointed: Samuel\r\nBarstow, C. H. Van Cleeck, Isaac P. Christiancy, G. W. Burchard, Lovell\r\nMoore, James W. Hill, Henry W. Lord, and Newell Avery. While they were\r\ndeliberating, the convention adjourned to the oak grove, and there\r\nlistened to brief speeches until a permanent organization was effected\r\nwith the following gentlemen as officers of the first Republican State\r\nconvention ever held:\r\n\r\n  President--David S. Walbridge, of Kalamazoo.\r\n\r\n  Vice-Presidents--F. C. Beaman, Oliver Johnson, Rudolph Diepenbeck,\r\n  Thomas Curtis, C. T. Gorham, Pliny Power, Emanuel Mann, Charles\r\n  Draper, George Winslow, Norman Little, John McKinney, W. W. Murphy.\r\n\r\n  Secretaries--J. Van Renselaer, J. F. Conover, A. B. Turner.\r\n\r\nMr. Walbridge was a prominent merchant of Central Michigan, and an\r\nexceedingly active and earnest Whig. He had already served several\r\nterms in the Legislature and was afterward a Republican Congressman\r\nfor four years from Michigan. His selection as president of the\r\nconvention was a wise recognition of the important Whig element in its\r\nmembership. The great throng next separated into representatives of\r\nthe four congressional districts, and chose the following committee\r\non resolutions: Jacob M. Howard, Austin Blair, Donald McIntyre, John\r\nHilsendegen, Charles Noble, Alfred R. Metcalf, John W. Turner, Levi\r\nBaxter, Marsh Giddings, E. Hussey, A. Williams, John McKinney, Chas.\r\nDraper, M. L. Higgins, J. E. Simmonds, Z. B. Knight. The chairmanship\r\nof this important committee naturally fell to Jacob M. Howard,\r\nof Detroit, a lawyer of eminence and rare powers, the first Whig\r\nCongressman from Michigan, and a man of deservedly high reputation\r\nfor intellectual vigor and personal integrity. He was afterward for\r\nnine years a Republican Senator, and at Washington earned national\r\ndistinction as the author of the Thirteenth Amendment and by much\r\nable and laborious public service. Mr. Howard had prepared a draft\r\nof a platform in advance of the convention, and the committee met to\r\nconsider it under a clump of trees on the outskirts of the grove (at\r\nthe present intersection of Franklin and Second streets in the city\r\nof Jackson). No material modifications were made in the document,\r\nwhich was adopted substantially as written by Mr. Howard, except that\r\nAustin Blair proposed to add two resolutions relating to State affairs\r\npurely. As to the expediency of this action there was some difference\r\nof opinion, and finally Mr. Blair submitted his propositions as a\r\nminority report, and the convention adopted and thus added them to the\r\nmain platform. Over the resolution formally christening the new party\r\n\"Republican,\" there was no especial discussion. There had already been\r\nsuggestions made throughout the country that, for the new organization\r\nevidently about to be born, it might be expedient to revive \"the name\r\nof that wise conservative party, whose aim and purpose were the welfare\r\nof the whole Union and the stainless honor of the American name.\"[4]\r\nThe history of this resolution in the Howard platform has been thus\r\ngiven with undoubted correctness by Mr. Joseph Warren in a published\r\nletter: \"The honor of having named and christened the party the writer\r\nhas always claimed and now insists belongs jointly to Jacob M. Howard,\r\nHorace Greeley and himself. Soon after the writer began to advocate,\r\nthrough the columns of the _Tribune_, the organization of all opponents\r\nof slavery into a single party, Horace Greeley voluntarily opened a\r\ncorrespondence with him in regard to this movement, in which he frankly\r\ncommunicated his views and gave him many valuable suggestions as to the\r\nwisest course to be pursued. This correspondence was necessarily very\r\nshort, as it began and ended in June, it being only five weeks from the\r\nrepeal of the compromise, May 30, to the Jackson convention. In his\r\nlast letter, received only a day or two before it was to assemble, Mr.\r\nGreeley suggested to him 'Republican,' according to his recollection,\r\nbut, as Mr. Howard contended, 'Democrat-Republican,' as an appropriate\r\nname for the proposed new party. But this is of comparatively little\r\nconsequence. The material fact is, that this meeting the writer's\r\ncordial approval, he gave Mr. Greeley's letter containing the\r\nsuggestions to Mr. Howard on the day of the convention, after he had\r\nbeen appointed chairman of the committee on resolutions, and strongly\r\nadvised its adoption. This was done and the platform adopted.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the committee on resolutions was absent, the convention was\r\naddressed by Zachariah Chandler, Kinsley S. Bingham, and a number of\r\nothers. No complete record was made of Mr. Chandler's remarks upon\r\nthis occasion, but the report of the convention in the Detroit _Free\r\nDemocrat_, prepared by its secretary, contains this: \"We would say in\r\nparenthesis that an allusion most generously made by Mr. Chandler to\r\nMr. Bingham drew from the crowd three rousing cheers for the latter\r\ngentleman.\" The Jackson _Citizen_ also gave the following reference\r\nto Mr. Chandler's remarks: \"When in the course of his speech he gave\r\na brief history of the Wilmot Proviso in Michigan, alluding to the\r\nanti-slavery resolutions passed by a Democratic State convention\r\nin 1849, and the resolutions of instructions to our Senators and\r\nRepresentatives in Congress by the Legislature on the same subject,\r\nand then exclaimed that 'not one of our Representatives had ever been\r\n_honest_ enough to carry them out except Kinsley S. Bingham, a spark\r\nof enthusiasm fired the crowd, the shout of approbation ran through\r\nthe vast assembly, and, if any doubt had previously existed as to who\r\nshould be the man, that doubt was then removed.\" These addresses were\r\nfollowed by the report of the committee on resolutions, which was read\r\nby Mr. Howard amid frequent outbursts of applause, and was as follows:\r\n\r\n  The freemen of Michigan, assembled in convention in pursuance of\r\n  a spontaneous call, emanating from various parts of the State, to\r\n  consider upon the measures which duty demands of us, as citizens of\r\n  a free State, to take in reference to the late acts of Congress on\r\n  the subject of slavery and its anticipated further extension, do\r\n\r\n  _Resolve_, That the institution of slavery except in punishment\r\n  of crime is a great moral, social and political evil; that it was\r\n  so regarded by the fathers of the republic, the founders and best\r\n  friends of the Union, by the heroes and sages of the Revolution\r\n  who contemplated and intended its gradual and peaceful extinction\r\n  as an element hostile to the liberties for which they toiled;\r\n  that its history in the United States, the experience of men best\r\n  acquainted with its workings, the dispassionate confession of\r\n  those who are interested in it; its tendency to relax the vigor\r\n  of industry and enterprise inherited in the white man; the very\r\n  surface of the earth where it subsists; the vices and immoralities\r\n  which are its natural growth; the stringent police, often wanting\r\n  in humanity and revolting to the sentiments of every generous\r\n  heart, which it demands; the danger it has already wrought and the\r\n  future danger which it portends to the security of the Union and\r\n  our constitutional liberties--all incontestably prove it to lie\r\n  such evil. Surely that institution is not to be strengthened and\r\n  encouraged against which Washington, the calmest and wisest of our\r\n  nation, bore unequivocal testimony; as to which Jefferson, filled\r\n  with a love of liberty, exclaimed: \"Can the liberties of a nation\r\n  be ever thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis,\r\n  a conviction in the minds of the people that their liberties are\r\n  THE GIFT OF GOD; that they are not to be violated but with His\r\n  wrath? Indeed, I tremble, for my country when I reflect that God\r\n  is just; that His justice cannot sleep forever; that, considering\r\n  numbers, nature and natural means only, a revolution of the wheel\r\n  of fortune, an exchange of situation is among possible events; that\r\n  it may become probable by supernatural interference! The Almighty\r\n  has no attribute which can take sides with us in such a contest!\"\r\n  And as to which another eminent patriot in Virginia, on the close\r\n  of the Revolution, also exclaimed: \"Had we turned our eyes inwardly\r\n  when we supplicated the Father of Mercies to aid the injured and\r\n  oppressed, when we invoked the Author of Righteousness to attest\r\n  the purity of our motives and the justice of our cause, and\r\n  implored the God of battles to aid our exertions in its defense,\r\n  should we not have stood more self-convicted than the contrite\r\n  publican?\" We believe these sentiments to be as true now as they\r\n  were then.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That slavery is a violation of the rights of man as\r\n  man; that the law of nature, which is the law of liberty, gives to\r\n  no man rights superior to those of another; that God and nature\r\n  have secured to each individual the inalienable right of equality,\r\n  any violation of which must be the result of superior force; and\r\n  that slavery therefore is a perpetual war upon its victims; that\r\n  whether we regard the institution as first originating in captures\r\n  made in war, or the subjection of the debtor as the slave of his\r\n  creditor, or the forcible seizure and sale of children by their\r\n  parents or subjects by their king, and whether it be viewed in\r\n  this country as a \"_necessary evil_\" or otherwise, we find it to\r\n  be, like imprisonment for debt, but a relic of barbarism as well\r\n  as an element of weakness in the midst of the State, inviting the\r\n  attack of external enemies, and a ceaseless cause of internal\r\n  apprehension and alarm. Such are the lessons taught us, not only\r\n  by the histories of other commonwealths, but by that of our own\r\n  beloved country.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the history of the formation of the constitution,\r\n  and particularly the enactment of the ordinance of July 13, 1787,\r\n  prohibiting slavery north of the Ohio, abundantly shows it to have\r\n  been the purpose of our fathers not to promote but to prevent\r\n  the spread of slavery. And we, reverencing their memories and\r\n  cherishing free republican faith as our richest inheritance, which\r\n  we vow, at whatever expense, to defend, thus publicly proclaim our\r\n  determination to oppose by all the powerful and honorable means in\r\n  our power, now and henceforth, all attempts, direct or indirect, to\r\n  extend slavery in this country, or to permit it to extend into any\r\n  region or locality in which it does not now exist by positive law,\r\n  or to admit new slave States into the Union.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the constitution of the United States gives to\r\n  Congress full and complete power for the municipal government of\r\n  the territories thereof, a power which from its nature cannot be\r\n  either alienated or abdicated without yielding up to the territory\r\n  an absolute political independence, which involves an absurdity.\r\n  That the exercise of this power necessarily looks to the formation\r\n  of States to be admitted into the Union; and on the question\r\n  whether they shall be admitted as _free_ or _slave_ States Congress\r\n  has a right to adopt such prudential and preventive measures as\r\n  the principles of liberty and the interests of the whole country\r\n  require. That this question is one of the gravest importance to\r\n  the free States, inasmuch as the constitution itself creates an\r\n  inequality in the apportionment of representatives, greatly to the\r\n  detriment of the free and to the advantage of the slave States.\r\n  This question, so vital to the interests of the free States (but\r\n  which we are told by certain political doctors of modern times is\r\n  to be treated with utter indifference) is one which we hold it to\r\n  be our right to _discuss_; which we hold it the duty of Congress\r\n  in every instance to determine in unequivocal language, and in\r\n  a manner to _prevent_ the spread of slavery and the increase of\r\n  such unequal representation. In short, we claim that the North is\r\n  a _party to the new bargain, and is entitled to have a voice and\r\n  influence in settling its terms_. And in view of the ambitious\r\n  designs of the slave power, we regard the man or the party who\r\n  would forego this right, as untrue to the honor and interest of the\r\n  North and unworthy of its support.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the repeal of the \"Missouri Compromise,\" contained\r\n  in the recent act of Congress for the creation of the territories\r\n  of Nebraska and Kansas, thus admitting slavery into a region till\r\n  then sealed against it by law, equal in extent to the thirteen old\r\n  States, is an act unprecedented in the history of the country, and\r\n  one which must engage the earnest and serious attention of every\r\n  Northern man. And as Northern freemen, independent of all former\r\n  parties, we here hold this measure up to the public execration, for\r\n  the following reasons:\r\n\r\n  That it is a plain departure from the policy of the fathers of\r\n  the republic in regard to slavery, and a wanton and dangerous\r\n  frustration of their purposes and their hopes.\r\n\r\n  That it actually admits _and was intended to admit_ slavery into\r\n  said territories, and thus (to use the words applied by Judge\r\n  Tucker, of Virginia, to the fathers of that commonwealth) \"sows the\r\n  seeds of an evil which like a leprosy hath descended upon their\r\n  posterity with accumulated rancor, visiting the sins of the fathers\r\n  upon succeeding generations.\" That it was sprung upon the country\r\n  stealthily and by surprise, without necessity, without petition,\r\n  and without previous discussion, thus violating the cardinal\r\n  principle of republican government, which requires all legislation\r\n  to accord with the opinions and sentiments of the people.\r\n\r\n  That on the part of the South it is an open and undisguised\r\n  breach of faith, as contracted between the North and South in\r\n  the settlement of the Missouri question in 1820, by which the\r\n  tranquillity of the two sections was restored; a compromise binding\r\n  upon all honorable men.\r\n\r\n  That it is also an open violation of the compromise of 1850, by\r\n  which, for the sake of peace, and to calm the distempered pulse of\r\n  certain enemies of the Union at the South, the North accepted and\r\n  acquiesced in the odious \"fugitive slave law\" of that year.\r\n\r\n  That it is also an undisguised and unmanly contempt of the pledge\r\n  given to the country by the present dominant party at their\r\n  national convention in 1852, not to \"_agitate the subject of\r\n  slavery in or out of Congress_,\" being the same convention that\r\n  nominated Franklin Pierce to the Presidency.\r\n\r\n  That it is greatly injurious to the free States, and to the\r\n  Territories themselves, tending to retard the settlement and to\r\n  prevent the improvement of the country by means of free labor, and\r\n  to discourage foreign immigrants resorting thither for their homes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST REPUBLICAN STATE CONVENTION.\r\n\r\n\"UNDER THE OAKS,\" JACKSON, MICH., JULY 6, 1854.]\r\n\r\n  That one of its principal aims is to give to the slave States\r\n  such a decided and practical preponderance in all the measures of\r\n  government as shall reduce the North, with all her industry, wealth\r\n  and enterprise, to be the mere province of a few slaveholding\r\n  oligarchs of the South--a condition too shameful to be contemplated.\r\n\r\n  Because, as openly avowed by its Southern friends, it is intended\r\n  as an entering wedge to the still further augmentation of the slave\r\n  power by the acquisition of the other Territories, cursed with the\r\n  same \"leprosy.\"\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the obnoxious measure to which we have alluded\r\n  ought to be _repealed_, and a provision substituted for it,\r\n  prohibiting slavery in said Territories, and each of them.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That after this gross breach of faith and wanton\r\n  affront to us as Northern men, we hold ourselves absolved from all\r\n  \"_compromises_\" (except those expressed in the constitution) for\r\n  the protection of slavery and slave-owners; that we now demand\r\n  measures of protection and immunity for ourselves; and among them\r\n  we demand the _repeal of the fugitive slave law_, and an act to\r\n  abolish slavery in the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That we notice without dismay certain popular\r\n  indications by slaveholders on the frontier of said Territories of\r\n  a purpose on their part to prevent by violence the settlement of\r\n  the country by non-slaveholding men. To the latter we say: Be of\r\n  good cheer, persevere in the right, remember the Republican motto,\r\n  \"THE NORTH WILL DEFEND YOU.\"\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That postponing and suspending all differences with\r\n  regard to political economy or administrative policy, in view of\r\n  the imminent danger that Kansas and Nebraska will be grasped by\r\n  slavery, and a thousand miles of slave soil be thus interposed\r\n  between the free States of the Atlantic and those of the Pacific,\r\n  we will act cordially and faithfully in unison to avert and repeal\r\n  this gigantic wrong and shame.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That in view of the necessity of battling for the first\r\n  principles of republican government, and against the schemes of an\r\n  aristocracy, the most revolting and oppressive with which the earth\r\n  was ever cursed, or man debased, we will co-operate and be known as\r\n  REPUBLICANS until the contest be terminated.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That we earnestly recommend the calling of a general\r\n  convention of the free States, and such of the slaveholding States,\r\n  or portions thereof, as may desire to be there represented, with a\r\n  view to the adoption of other more extended and effectual measures\r\n  in resistance to the encroachments of slavery; and that a committee\r\n  of five persons be appointed to correspond and co-operate with our\r\n  friends in other States on the subject.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That in relation to the domestic affairs of the State\r\n  we urge a more economical administration of the government and a\r\n  more rigid accountability of the public officers: a speedy payment\r\n  of the balance of the public debt, and the lessening of the amount\r\n  of taxation: a careful preservation of the primary school and\r\n  university funds, and their diligent application to the great\r\n  objects for which they were created; and also further legislation\r\n  to prevent the unnecessary or imprudent sale of the lands belonging\r\n  to the State.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That in our opinion the commercial wants of Michigan\r\n  require the enactment of a general railroad law, which, while\r\n  it shall secure the investment and encourage the enterprise of\r\n  stockholders, shall also guard and protect the rights of the public\r\n  and of individuals, and that the preparation of such a measure\r\n  requires the first talents of the State.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions were adopted almost unanimously, and thereupon Isaac\r\nP. Christiancy, as chairman of the committee of sixteen appointed by\r\nthe Kalamazoo convention, came forward and announced the absolute\r\nabandonment of the State ticket and organization of the Free\r\nDemocracy--an act which was greeted with loud and prolonged applause. A\r\ncommittee of ninety, consisting of three from each Senatorial district\r\nin the State, and including the names of Jacob M. Howard, Moses\r\nWisner, Charles M. Croswell, Fernando C. Beaman, and Chas. T. Gorham,\r\nwas next appointed to nominate a State ticket, and the convention\r\nadjourned until evening. At that session, which was held in one of the\r\nvillage halls, a State central committee was chosen, and the committee\r\non nominations reported the following ticket which was unanimously\r\nendorsed by the convention, this closing its formal proceedings:\r\n\r\n             Governor--Kinsley S. Bingham, of Livingston.\r\n            Lieutenant-Governor--George A. Coe, of Branch.\r\n           Secretary of State--John McKinney, of Van Buren.\r\n              State Treasurer--Silas M. Holmes, of Wayne.\r\n             Attorney-General--Jacob M. Howard, of Wayne.\r\n              Auditor-General--Whitney Jones, of Ingham.\r\n    Commissioner of Land Office--Seymour B. Treadwell, of Jackson.\r\n     Superintendent of Public Instruction--Ira Mayhew, of Monroe.\r\n        Member Board of Education--John R. Kellogg, of Allegan.\r\n            (To fill vacancy)--Hiram L. Miller, of Saginaw.\r\n\r\nThe response of the anti-slavery masses to the action of the convention\r\nwas prompt and cordial. Some of the more earnest and enthusiastic\r\nWhigs who had hoped that the Northern wing of their party could be\r\ntransformed into an efficient champion of slavery restriction--Mr.\r\nChandler had shared in this feeling--at first doubted the wisdom of\r\nwhat had been done. They found themselves called upon to make large\r\nsacrifices of cherished traditions and ties, and felt that their\r\nrepresentation upon the fusion State ticket was not in due proportion\r\nto the number of votes they would be expected to contribute to its\r\nelection. But this not unnatural feeling of early disappointment\r\nhad but a brief existence among the Whigs of strong anti-slavery\r\nconvictions. As the good faith of the movement, the spontaneous\r\ncharacter of the popular uprising, and the possibility of accomplishing\r\nanti-slavery union throughout the North became clear, they laid aside\r\nall hesitation and joined with sincere ardor in the work of Republican\r\norganization. Before the close of the summer of 1854 the strong\r\nleaders and the intelligent rank and file of the Michigan Whigs had\r\naccepted the new fellowship, and the action of the Jackson convention\r\nreceived their hearty acquiescence and loyal support. Mr. Chandler\r\nrendered valuable service in the following campaign as an organizer of\r\nRepublicanism throughout Michigan, and put into this work enough of his\r\ncharacteristic vigor to earn from the Democratic papers the title of\r\nthe \"traveling agent\" of the \"new Abolition party.\"\r\n\r\nThere was still among the Whigs a small conservative minority who,\r\nchiefly through the inspiration of pro-slavery sentiment and under\r\nthe leadership of the Detroit _Advertiser_, made a desperate effort\r\nto prevent the abandonment of their party organization. They procured\r\nthe signing of a circular addressed to the Whig committee asking that\r\na State convention should be held, and in compliance with this request\r\na call was issued for a convention to meet at Marshall on October 4.\r\nWhen it assembled it was found that the great majority of its delegates\r\nfavored union with the Republicans. They controlled its proceedings\r\nthroughout, and put in the chair Rufus Hosmer who was then the head of\r\nthe new Republican State central committee, elected a State central\r\ncommittee composed of ardent fusionists, defeated the schemes for the\r\nnomination of a ticket, and issued an address urging the Whigs of\r\nMichigan to unite in this campaign with all other opponents of the\r\nspread of slavery. This decisive action made the Michigan election of\r\n1854 a contest between Republicanism and the Democracy (which held its\r\nconvention at Detroit on September 14, and placed John S. Barry at the\r\nhead of its State ticket).\r\n\r\nThe local result of the Jackson convention was a permanent political\r\nrevolution. In November the Republicans elected their entire State\r\nticket (giving Mr. Bingham 43,652 votes to 38,675 for Mr. Barry),\r\nthree of the four Congressmen, and a Legislature with an overwhelming\r\nmajority in both branches against the Kansas-Nebraska policy. The\r\nRepublican ascendancy thus established in Michigan has never been\r\nimpaired. That party has been victorious in every State election since\r\n1854; and of the Governors since chosen every one who was at that time\r\na resident of the State (Henry H. Crapo did not settle in Michigan\r\nuntil 1856) was a member of the Jackson convention. Michigan has also\r\nsince sent only Republicans to the Senate; every one of them except\r\nThomas W. Ferry (who had barely attained his majority in 1854) was a\r\nprominent actor in the scenes \"under the oaks.\" It has sent seventy-six\r\nRepublicans and only seven Democrats to the House of Representatives,\r\nand the Republicans have controlled both branches of every Legislature\r\nsince 1854. Iowa is the only State which can point to a similar record\r\nof uninterrupted Republican victory. In Vermont the Democrats have been\r\nuniformly defeated, but the opposition ticket in 1854 was not called\r\nRepublican. Of the States which have been admitted since 1854, three\r\n(Kansas, Nebraska and Minnesota) have been steadfastly Republican, but\r\nMichigan surpasses them in the duration, while she equals them in the\r\nquality, of her fidelity to the party of Freedom. Each of the other\r\nNorthern States has at least once chosen an anti-Republican Governor,\r\nwhile Michigan (with Iowa) has been uniformly Republican.\r\n\r\nThe claim that Michigan was the first State to organize and name the\r\nRepublican party cannot be successfully disputed.[5] The convention\r\n\"under the oaks\" of Jackson ante-dates by a week or more all similar\r\nbodies. The first Republican convention in Wisconsin was held at\r\nMadison on July 13, 1854. Its call was issued (July 9) after a number\r\nof Anti-Nebraska meetings had been held in different parts of the\r\nState, and invited \"all men opposed to the repeal of the Missouri\r\ncompromise and the extension of the slave power\" to take part. This\r\nconvention adopted the following as one of its resolutions:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That we accept the issue forced upon us by the slave\r\n  power, and in defense of Freedom, will co-operate and be known as\r\n  Republicans.\r\n\r\nThe Anti-Nebraska men of Massachusetts met in convention on July 19\r\nof the same year, and organized the Republican party in that State by\r\nadopting the following resolution:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That in co-operation with the friends of Freedom in\r\n  sister States, we hereby form the Republican party of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nBut the Republicans did not carry Massachusetts that year, the\r\nAnti-Nebraska vote being cast almost solidly for the successful\r\nKnow-Nothing ticket. In Vermont, on July 13, 1854, a mass convention\r\nwas held of persons \"in favor of resisting, by all constitutional\r\nmeans, the usurpations of the propagandists of slavery.\" Among the\r\nresolutions there adopted was one which closed with these words: \"We\r\npropose and respectfully recommend to the friends of Freedom in other\r\nStates to co-operate and be known as Republicans.\" A State ticket was\r\nnominated, but, the State committees of the various parties being\r\nempowered \"to fill vacancies,\" a fusion ticket was afterward placed in\r\nthe field, voted for and elected under the name of Fusion. On the same\r\nday a convention was held in Columbus, O., which organized a canvass\r\nwhich swept that State at the fall elections; during this campaign\r\nmost of the Anti-Nebraska candidates called themselves Republicans,\r\nand the party formally adopted that name at the State convention in\r\n1855 which nominated Salmon P. Chase for Governor. It will be seen\r\nthat the Jackson convention preceded all these kindred gatherings. To\r\nthis statement may be profitably added the testimony of Henry Wilson,\r\nwho, after thoroughly investigating the whole subject of the origin of\r\nRepublicanism, wrote:[6]\r\n\r\n  But whatever suggestions others may have made, or whatever action\r\n  may have been taken elsewhere, to Michigan belongs the honor of\r\n  being the first State to form and christen the Republican party.\r\n  More than three months before the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska\r\n  bill the Free Soil convention had adopted a mixed ticket, made\r\n  up of Free-Soilers and Whigs, in order that there might be a\r\n  combination of the anti-slavery elements of the State. Immediately\r\n  on the passage of the Nebraska bill, Joseph Warren, editor of\r\n  the Detroit _Tribune_, entered upon a course of measures that\r\n  resulted in bringing the Whig and Free Soil parties together, not\r\n  by a mere coalition of the two, but by a fusion of the elements\r\n  of which the two were composed. In his own language, he \"took\r\n  ground in favor of disbanding the Whig and Free Soil parties and\r\n  of the organization of a new party, composed of all the opponents\r\n  of slavery extension.\" Among the first steps taken toward the\r\n  accomplishment of this vitally important object was the withdrawal\r\n  of the Free Soil ticket. This having been effected, a call for a\r\n  mass convention was issued signed by more than 10,000 names. The\r\n  convention met on the 6th day of July, and was largely attended.\r\n\r\n  A platform drawn by the Hon. Jacob M. Howard, afterward United\r\n  States Senator from Michigan, was adopted, not only opposing the\r\n  extension of slavery, but declaring in favor of its abolition\r\n  in the District of Columbia. The report also proposed the name\r\n  of \"Republican\" for the new party, which was adopted by the\r\n  convention. Kinsley S. Bingham was nominated for Governor, and\r\n  was triumphantly elected; and Michigan, thus early to enter the\r\n  ranks of the Republican party, has remained steadfast to its then\r\n  publicly-avowed principles and faith.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Michigan convention of July 6, 1854, was only one\r\ndevelopment of a vast national agitation. The forces that gave it being\r\nwere at work throughout the continent. Like movements were on foot in\r\nevery Northern State. Kindred bodies met in the same month to take\r\nthe same action. But to the men who gathered on that mid-summer day\r\nin the oak grove at Jackson belongs the honor of being the first to\r\ncomprehend a great opportunity; they were wise enough to improve all\r\nits possibilities, and there founded and named the party of the future.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] Israel Washburn in an address at Bangor, Me.\r\n\r\n[5] The Senator from Virginia has stated that the Republican party\r\noriginated in New England, from Know Nothingism. It is not true, sir;\r\nit had no such origin; it originated in no such place and from no\r\nsuch source. The Republican party was born in Michigan, on the sixth\r\nday of July, 1854. It had no origin from Know Nothingism or any other\r\nthing, except the outrageous, the infamous repeal of the time-honored\r\nMissouri compromise by the Congress of that year. It was christened\r\nthe Republican party at its birth. It is perfectly evident the Senator\r\nfrom Virginia knows nothing at all about the Republican party, its\r\norigin, its ends, or its aims. He does not know anything about its\r\nbirth or its principles. I merely wish to correct the misapprehension\r\non his part that it was born in New England or anywhere else out of the\r\nState of Michigan. There is where it was born, sir; and we glory in the\r\nproduction of such a child.--_Mr. Chandler in the Senate, December 14,\r\n1859, in reply to Senator Mason, of Virginia._\r\n\r\n[6] Wilson's \"Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in America,\" volume 2,\r\npage 412.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST ELECTION TO THE SENATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe abrogation of the Missouri compromise was followed by the arbitrary\r\nenforcement of the Fugitive Slave act in important Northern cities, and\r\nby a determined struggle between freedom and slavery for the possession\r\nof the virgin soil of Kansas. These phases of \"the irrepressible\r\nconflict\" were attended by many exciting incidents which constantly\r\nstrengthened the new anti-slavery party in the North and in the end\r\nmade it the main competitor of the Democracy in the presidential\r\nelection of 1856. The decisive character of its victory in Michigan\r\nin 1854 made Republicanism especially strong in that State, and the\r\nevents of each successive month of 1855 and 1856 added to its power\r\nboth in numbers and in sentiment. Throughout this period Mr. Chandler\r\nlabored, in public and in private, and with earnestness and effect, to\r\ninspire the new party with vigor of conviction and unflinching firmness\r\nof purpose. No man did more than he to make it thoroughly \"radical,\"\r\nand his former prominence as a Whig rendered his efforts especially\r\nfruitful. His earliest Republican speeches did not differ from his\r\nlatest in courage of opinion, in plainness of expression, or in\r\nmanifest sincerity of conviction. On September 12, 1855, he addressed,\r\nwith Henry Wilson, an immense mass-meeting at Kalamazoo, and denounced\r\nthe border-ruffian crimes in Kansas in the strongest terms. On the 30th\r\nof May, 1856, he was one of the speakers at a large meeting held in the\r\ncity of Detroit to consider the assault of Preston Brooks upon Charles\r\nSumner. He there gave expression to Republican indignation in the\r\nplainest language. After fitly describing the era of pro-slavery murder\r\nin Kansas, and the recent crime of \"a cowardly assassin on the very\r\nfloor of the Senate of the United States,\" he offered two resolutions,\r\none demanding the impeachment of Franklin Pierce for his action in\r\nrelation to Kansas, and a second to expel Rust, of Arkansas, for his\r\nattack upon Horace Greeley, and Preston Brooks for his assault on Mr.\r\nSumner. Then he said in substance:\r\n\r\n  This is not a time for argument. It is a time for action, for\r\n  speaking boldly and fearlessly.... This assault is upon the entire\r\n  North. So long have craven doughface representatives sat in her\r\n  places in Congress that the South has come to doubt our manhood....\r\n  We should uphold the hands of our representatives, and tell them\r\n  that an indignity offered to them is an indignity offered to us.\r\n  [Applause.] ... The resolution calling for the impeachment of\r\n  the President is one proper to be offered. He has connived at\r\n  and aided all this Kansas treachery and wrong. He supports the\r\n  bogus Legislature of Kansas and orders its odious laws enforced.\r\n  If Thomas Jefferson was to read his preamble to the Declaration\r\n  of Independence in Kansas, he could be condemned by those laws\r\n  to imprisonment in the penitentiary for two years.... What the\r\n  British did at Lexington, the United States troops, under the\r\n  orders of President Pierce, did at Lawrence. Our fathers resisted\r\n  by all means in their power. We should imitate their example. What\r\n  should we do?... We should send enough men there to put Kansas in a\r\n  peaceable condition.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler also said: \"Had I been on the floor of the Senate when\r\nthat assault occurred, so help me God, that ruffian's blood would\r\nhave flowed,\" and he closed by declaring that Detroit should send one\r\nhundred men to Kansas, and by pledging himself, if that was done, to\r\ndevote his entire income while they were there to aiding in their\r\nmaintenance. He also made a forcible speech at a Kansas relief meeting,\r\nheld in Detroit, to greet Gov. Andrew H. Reeder, on June 2, 1856,\r\nand then headed a subscription paper for the aid of the struggling\r\nFree State men of that territory with the sum of $10,000. Actions and\r\nutterances of this kind in the plastic days of Michigan Republicanism\r\ngave to it that resolute and robust character which has been the source\r\nof its power.\r\n\r\nThe first national convention of the Republican party was held at\r\nPittsburg on the 22d of February, 1856, under a call issued by\r\nthe chairmen of the Republican committees of Ohio, Massachusetts,\r\nPennsylvania, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Michigan. It was attended by\r\ndelegates representing twenty-seven States and territories, and\r\nprovided for the national organization of the Republican party by\r\ncreating a general executive committee and calling a convention, to\r\nmeet at Philadelphia on June 17, to nominate a presidential ticket.\r\nMichigan was represented at Pittsburg by a delegation of eighteen,\r\nheaded by Zachariah Chandler, and including Kinsley S. Bingham, Jacob\r\nM. Howard, and Fernando C. Beaman. Mr. Chandler was also a member of\r\nthe committee which reported the plan for the national organization of\r\nthe Republican party, and he participated briefly in the debates of\r\nthat important gathering. The Michigan convention to elect delegates to\r\nPhiladelphia was held at Ann Arbor, on March 8, 1856, and was addressed\r\nby Mr. Chandler and other prominent Republicans. He was a member of the\r\nPhiladelphia convention, acting as an alternate for Charles T. Gorham,\r\nand, after Fremont was nominated, formally promised that the electoral\r\nvote of Michigan should be given for the ticket. He was there made the\r\nmember for his State of the first Republican National Committee. The\r\nMichigan delegation at Philadelphia originally supported Mr. Seward for\r\nthe presidency, but finally joined in the movement to nominate General\r\nFremont on the first ballot. For the vice-presidency the majority of\r\nthe delegation supported William L. Dayton, but Mr. Chandler, with four\r\nothers, voted for Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\nIn the following campaign Mr. Chandler was among the most active of\r\nthe Republican leaders. He aided liberally in the work of organizing\r\nthe party throughout the State, and spoke at Detroit several times,\r\nand at Kalamazoo, Lapeer, Port Huron, Adrian, Coldwater, and other of\r\nthe important cities and towns of Michigan. He also held one joint\r\ndiscussion with Alpheus Felch, at Olivet, on October 16. The tone of\r\nhis public utterances in 1856 will appear from these extracts from his\r\nspeech at Kalamazoo (on August 27) before an immense mass-meeting,\r\nwhich was also addressed by Abraham Lincoln and Jacob M. Howard:\r\n\r\n  The Republicans of Michigan stand by the constitution, and when\r\n  their defamers proclaim that they are a disunion party, as they\r\n  do so often, they publish what they know to be a falsehood.... We\r\n  are determined to stand by the constitution in all its parts, and,\r\n  more than that, to make our adversaries stand by it in all and\r\n  every part.... Our opponents have ignored this constitution with\r\n  but a single exception. And what is that exception? It is the key\r\n  to their character and their principles. In this whole instrument\r\n  they acknowledge but one clause, and that is the right to reclaim\r\n  fugitive slaves from their hard-earned freedom!\r\n\r\n  We intend to make our opponents stand by this clause: \"The citizens\r\n  of each State shall be entitled to the privileges of all the\r\n  States.\" But how is this at present on the Missouri? The citizens\r\n  of Massachusetts, of New Jersey, of Pennsylvania or of Michigan,\r\n  if they but presume to enter Kansas, are sent back with a guard or\r\n  murdered in cold blood, while the citizens of the South are aided\r\n  on their way to plant in that beautiful territory the accursed\r\n  blight of slavery. We will make them stand by the constitution in\r\n  all its parts, or, by the Eternal, we will have a different state\r\n  of things here. The oak shall bear other fruit than acorns if the\r\n  constitution be not upheld.\r\n\r\n  Here is another clause of that instrument: \"Congress shall make no\r\n  law abridging the freedom of speech or the press.\" How is it in\r\n  Kansas to-day regarding this? If any man shall dare to deny the\r\n  right to hold slaves in that territory he is imprisoned for a term\r\n  of five years.\r\n\r\n  Our opponents must also stand by this clause of the constitution:\r\n  \"A well-regulated militia being necessary of a free state, the\r\n  right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\"\r\n  That clause of the constitution is trampled under foot, and the\r\n  Democratic platform in sustaining Pierce's administration virtually\r\n  sustains and endorses the disgraceful outrage.\r\n\r\n  Here is another clause: \"No person shall be deprived of life,\r\n  liberty or property without due process of law.\" The whole history\r\n  of the Kansas matter shows how shamefully this clause has been\r\n  rejected by those who uphold the administration.\r\n\r\n  There are but two candidates for the Presidency and but two\r\n  platforms. The issue--the only issue--is: Shall slavery be\r\n  national? Shall it be under our protection, or shall it be under\r\n  the protection of the slave States only? The whole question of\r\n  platforms is in that. It is the only question.... The policy of\r\n  this government for twenty-five years has been pro-slavery. The\r\n  first act toward breaking that policy was the election of Banks\r\n  as Speaker last winter. It was the first of what I hope will be a\r\n  series of victories.\r\n\r\n  A few years ago there was great commotion in the land. We were told\r\n  \"the Union is in danger.\" \"What shall be done?\" That was the first\r\n  question. What was the answer of the men in power? \"Use the utmost\r\n  power of the government; the Union must be saved.\" Armed men went\r\n  through the streets of Boston. Troops were ordered there in great\r\n  numbers. Ships of war were sent to Massachusetts Bay. What was the\r\n  terrible danger of the Union? There was a Negro lost! A slave had\r\n  run away! A poor African had escaped from his master and--lo, the\r\n  Union was in danger! \"Use all the power of the government; the laws\r\n  must be enforced.\" Other troops were ordered there. The militia\r\n  were called out. They surrounded the jail. A sloop of war was sent.\r\n  Burns was borne back to his master and the Union was saved!\r\n\r\n  There came a later cry, \"the Union is in danger.\" This time it\r\n  was heard from bleeding Kansas. Armed bands were committing\r\n  daily depredations. This appeal reached the government, and what\r\n  answer is made by the party in power? \"I see nothing to call for\r\n  executive interference.\" \"Nothing?\" Yet an empire is being crushed.\r\n  \"Nothing?\" Yet houses are being robbed and burned, and helpless\r\n  women and children murdered! \"No cause for interference?\" The\r\n  reason is plain. There was no Negro lost.\r\n\r\nMichigan fulfilled the pledge made in her behalf at Philadelphia by\r\nMr. Chandler, and gave to the Fremont electors 71,762 votes, while the\r\nBuchanan ticket received but 52,136 and the Fillmore strength was only\r\n1,660. The Republicans thus more than trebled their majority of 1854,\r\nand in this year carried all of the four Congressional districts of the\r\nState. Their victory in the legislative districts was overwhelming, and\r\nthey elected twenty-nine of the thirty-one Senators, and sixty-three of\r\nthe eighty Representatives. The term of Lewis Cass as Senator of the\r\nUnited States expired on the 4th of the following March, and his State\r\nhad thus decided that he should give place to a representative of its\r\nearnest and aggressive Republican sentiment. Mr. Chandler was at once\r\nrecognized as the leading candidate for the position by reason of his\r\npositive qualities, his personal strength with the business classes\r\nof the State and the masses of the people, and his prominence as a\r\nrepresentative of the strong Whig element in the Republican ranks. The\r\nsenatorial canvass was an earnest one, but it was from the outset clear\r\nthat Mr. Chandler was the first choice of decidedly the largest number\r\nof legislators, and that no other man possessed his popular following.\r\nSome unavailing efforts were made to combine against him the friends\r\nof all other candidates, but the fact that he was also \"the second\r\nchoice\" of many members defeated this plan, and the Republican caucus\r\nmet at Lansing on January 8, 1857, with his marked lead in the contest\r\nstill unimpaired. Three ballots were taken at its first session, the\r\nthird giving Mr. Chandler a clear majority of all the votes cast. The\r\ncaucus then adjourned until the following day, when he received a still\r\nstronger support on the fourth ballot and was formally nominated on the\r\nfifth. The following is the record of the balloting:\r\n\r\n                             FIRST SESSION.

The scene which followed\r\nhas been thus described by an eyewitness: \"This was the only time in\r\nan acquaintance of nearly thirty years that I ever saw Mr. Chandler\r\nabashed. When brought before the caucus he trembled with emotion, and\r\nit was several minutes before he could compose himself to even briefly\r\nreturn his thanks. He has often said that it was the only time that his\r\ncourage and nerve absolutely failed him and that he completely broke\r\ndown. The rejoicing was so hearty and unselfish that it overcame him,\r\nand he trembled like a child.\" On the 10th of January the two branches\r\nof the Legislature voted for Senator, the Democrats complimenting\r\nGeneral Cass with their ineffectual votes. The record of the balloting\r\nwas as follows:\r\n\r\n                         SENATE.  HOUSE.

Among the members\r\nof the Legislature whose votes made him the first Republican Senator\r\nfrom Michigan were Thomas W. Ferry, in later years his colleague in the\r\nSenate, Omar D. Conger, who became afterward a Republican leader in the\r\nlower branch of Congress, and George Jerome, a most intimate political\r\nand personal friend throughout life.\r\n\r\nThe Senate of the Thirty-fifth Congress met in special session at\r\nWashington, on March 4, 1857, Franklin Pierce having convened it at the\r\nrequest of his successor, who was inaugurated on that day. The names\r\nupon its rolls were these:\r\n\r\n  Clement C. Clay, Jr., and Benj. Fitzpatrick, of Alabama;\r\n\r\n  Robert W. Johnson and Wm. K. Sebastian, of Arkansas;\r\n\r\n  David C. Broderick and Wm. M. Gwin, of California;\r\n\r\n  James Dixon and Lafayette S. Foster, of Connecticut;\r\n\r\n  Martin W. Bates and James A. Bayard, of Delaware;\r\n\r\n  Stephen R.

Fitch, of Indiana;\r\n\r\n  James Harlan and Geo. W. Jones, of Iowa;\r\n\r\n  John J. Crittenden and John B. Thompson, of Kentucky;\r\n\r\n  Judah P. Benjamin and John Slidell, of Louisiana;\r\n\r\n  W. P. Fessenden and Hannibal Hamlin, of Maine;\r\n\r\n  Anthony Kennedy and James A. Pearce, of Maryland;\r\n\r\n  Charles Sumner and Henry Wilson, of Massachusetts;\r\n\r\n  Zachariah Chandler and Chas. E. Stuart, of Michigan;\r\n\r\n  Albert G. Brown and Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi;\r\n\r\n  James S. Green and Trusten Polk, of Missouri;\r\n\r\n  James Bell and John P. Hale, of New Hampshire;\r\n\r\n  John R. Thomson and William Wright, of New Jersey;\r\n\r\n  Preston King and William H. Seward, of New York;\r\n\r\n  Asa Biggs and David S. Reid, of North Carolina;\r\n\r\n  Geo. E. Pugh and Benj. F.

Butler, of South Carolina;\r\n\r\n  John Bell and Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee;\r\n\r\n  Samuel Houston and Thos. J. Rusk, of Texas;\r\n\r\n  Jacob Collamer and Solomon Foot, of Vermont;\r\n\r\n  R. M. T. Hunter and James M. Mason, of Virginia;\r\n\r\n  James R. Doolittle and Charles Durkee, of Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NATIONAL CAPITOL AT WASHINGTON.]\r\n\r\nThis Senate met in the old chamber now occupied by the Supreme Court,\r\nbut around which then clustered fresh memories of Clay, Webster,\r\nCalhoun and their cotemporaries. The Secretary, Asbury Dickins,\r\ncalled the body to order, and in the absence of John C. Breckenridge,\r\nVice-President elect, James M. Mason of Virginia was chosen to preside\r\ntemporarily. After the roll was called of the members with unexpired\r\nterms, the list of newly-elected Senators was read. As they responded\r\nto their names they advanced to the front of the presiding officer's\r\ndesk, in groups of four, to take the oath of office. The first group\r\nwere Bates, Bayard, Bright and Broderick; the second consisted of\r\nSimon Cameron, Zachariah Chandler, Jefferson Davis and James Dixon.\r\nThis scene was the subject, twenty-two years later,[7] of the most\r\neffective speech ever delivered by Mr. Chandler; probably no speech\r\never uttered in the Senate more thoroughly touched the popular heart or\r\nwas more widely read. Of the men who were then United States Senators,\r\nparts and witnesses of this scene, Fitzpatrick, Sebastian, Broderick,\r\nDixon, Bates, Mallory, Iverson, Douglas, Bright, Crittenden, Thompson,\r\nSlidell, Fessenden, Kennedy, Pearce, Sumner, Wilson, Green, Hale,\r\nThomson, Wright, King, Seward, Pugh, Wade, Allen, Simmons, Evans,\r\nButler, John Bell, Jas. Bell, Andrew Johnson, Houston, Rusk, Collamer,\r\nFoot, Mason and Durkee (perhaps others) preceded Mr. Chandler to the\r\ngrave. Of this number, one (Broderick) was killed in a duel and two\r\ncommitted suicide (Rusk killed himself at Nacogdoches, Tex., on July\r\n29, 1857, and Preston King on August 15, 1865, and while collector of\r\nthe port of New York, jumped heavily weighted into the Hudson river).\r\n\r\nOf the members of this Senate Hamlin, Wilson (his original name was\r\nJeremiah Jones Colbath) and Johnson became Vice-Presidents, and\r\nJohnson, on the death of Abraham Lincoln, became President. Mr. Hamlin\r\nwas the only one still in the Senate at the time of Mr. Chandler's\r\ndeath, and his service had not been continuous but was broken by his\r\nVice-Presidential term. Sons of Cameron and Bayard were in 1879 in the\r\nseats occupied by their fathers in 1857. Seward became Secretary of\r\nState, Cameron Secretary of War, Fessenden Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nand Harlan and Chandler Secretaries of the Interior. Durkee became\r\nGovernor of Utah, Jones Minister to Colombia and Cameron Minister to\r\nRussia. Jones was, on his return from Colombia, arrested for treason\r\nand confined in Fort Warren. Bright was expelled for treasonable\r\ncorrespondence with the enemy; Polk was expelled for treason, and\r\nSebastian, who retired from the Senate when Arkansas seceded from\r\nthe Union, was also expelled, but after the war, ample proof being\r\nfurnished that he was and always remained true to the Union, the\r\nresolution of expulsion was rescinded. Doolittle, Trumbull, Dixon and\r\nFoster, who were Republicans in 1857, afterward joined the Democracy,\r\nand Mr. Seward also ceased to be in sympathy with the party to which\r\nhe was indebted for his greatest honors. Gwin identified himself with\r\nthe Confederacy, then became _aide_ to the unfortunate Maximilian, by\r\nwhom he was created \"Duke of Sonora,\" and is back again at Washington\r\nas a lobbyist. Douglas and John Bell were defeated candidates for the\r\nPresidency in 1860. Houston was Governor of Texas when the ordinance\r\nof secession passed and was deposed from his office by the disunion\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nJefferson Davis, who swore to support the constitution and the Union\r\nat the same instant with Mr. Chandler, within four years rebelled\r\nagainst the government and became President of the so-called \"Southern\r\nConfederacy.\" Slidell, the most skilful of the disunion leaders, and\r\nMason were appointed by the rebel government Commissioners to Great\r\nBritain, and while on their way across the ocean were seized by Captain\r\nWilkes, commanding the United States steamer San Jacinto, taken from\r\nthe British vessel Trent, and carried to Boston harbor, where they\r\nwere confined in Fort Warren on a charge of treason. This seizure the\r\nDepartment of State declined to uphold, and on the demand of Great\r\nBritain the \"embassadors\" were released. Slidell died abroad in merited\r\nobscurity. Benjamin became Secretary of War of the Confederacy, and\r\nafter its downfall emigrated to England, became a British citizen,\r\nand is a prosperous lawyer in London. Toombs was Confederate Secretary\r\nof State, and is still living in Georgia, crying as he did in 1861\r\n\"death to the Union.\" Mallory was Confederate Secretary of the Navy,\r\nand for a time after the war was imprisoned in Fort Lafayette. Hunter\r\nwas also Secretary of State of the Confederacy; since the war he has\r\nbeen Treasurer of Virginia, but with the political revolution of 1879\r\nretired to private life and poverty. Clay was a Confederate Senator\r\nand diplomatic agent; in 1865 he was imprisoned in Fortress Monroe.\r\nFitzpatrick was the original nominee for Vice-President on the Douglas\r\nticket in 1860, but declined; he became a rebel but without prominence.\r\nRobert W. Johnson was a Confederate Senator and afterward practiced law\r\nin Washington. Yulee (whose original name was David Levy) retired from\r\nthe Senate to join the Confederacy, ceased to be conspicuous, and is\r\nnow president of a railroad in Florida. Iverson was a Brigadier-General\r\nin the rebel army, as was also Toombs. Brown was Captain in the\r\nConfederate army and a member of the Confederate Senate. Butler died\r\nduring the following recess of Congress, and Evans, his colleague, died\r\nbefore the war. All of these Southern Senators, who retired with their\r\nStates in 1861 were afterward formally expelled from the Senate.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Chandler entered the Senate the House of Representatives was\r\ncontrolled by the Democrats, but out of 234 members ninety-two were\r\nfilled with the fresh blood of the Republican party. Some of these\r\nmen were then distinguished, and others have become so since, but of\r\nthe entire number of Representatives only twelve yet remain in either\r\nbranch of Congress. Henry L. Dawes is a Senator from Massachusetts,\r\nLafayette Grover from Oregon, Justin S. Morill from Vermont, Zebulon\r\nB. Vance from North Carolina, George H. Pendleton from Ohio, and L. Q.\r\nC. Lamar from Mississippi. Samuel S. Cox, a Representative from Ohio\r\nin 1857, is now a Representative from New York. Alex. H. Stephens of\r\nGeorgia, Alfred M. Scales of North Carolina, John H. Reagan of Texas,\r\nOtho R. Singleton of Mississippi, and John D. C. Atkins of Tennessee\r\nare again members of the House. Stephens was Vice-President of the\r\nConfederacy; Scales was Captain, Colonel and Brigadier-General in the\r\nrebel army; Singleton was Aid-de-camp to Gen. Robert E. Lee; and Atkins\r\nwas Lieutenant-Colonel of the Fifth Confederate Tennessee regiment, and\r\nafterward a member of the Confederate Congress.\r\n\r\nOthers who were members of the House in 1857 afterward added to the\r\nreputations they then enjoyed. Schuyler Colfax has been Vice-President.\r\nA. H. Cragin, R. E. Fenton, Thomas L. Clingman, Frank P. Blair, Jr.,\r\nJohn W. Stevenson, Edwin D. Morgan, Joshua Hill, and George S. Houston\r\nhave been United States Senators. Israel Washburn has been Governor of\r\nMaine, John Letcher of Virginia, and C. C. Washburn of Wisconsin. N. P.\r\nBanks was a General in the Union army, and is United States Marshal of\r\nMassachusetts. Daniel E. Sickles was also a General in the Union army\r\nand afterward Minister to Spain. Francis E. Spinner was for many years\r\nTreasurer of the United States. John Sherman has been a Senator, and is\r\nSecretary of the Treasury. Elihu B. Washburne was Minister to France.\r\nJohn A. Bingham is Minister to Japan, and Horace Maynard to Turkey.\r\nAnson Burlingame was Minister to China, and afterward the embassador\r\nof that empire to negotiate treaties with foreign powers. William A.\r\nHoward is Governor of Dakota, and John S. Phelps of Missouri. The roll\r\nof the dead of the Thirty-fifth House of Representatives far exceeds\r\nthat of the living.\r\n\r\nZachariah Chandler entered the Senate of the United States with an\r\nabiding faith in Northern civilization and its right to supremacy,\r\nwith a wise distrust of Southern professions, with a just hatred of\r\ninstitutions poisoned by slavery, with a determination to attack\r\ntreason wherever found, with an unquestioning belief that his cause was\r\nright and its defeat impossible, and with as resolute a spirit as ever\r\ncrossed the threshold of the Senate chamber. His nature was without an\r\natom of compromise, and was strong in the rugged qualities of courage,\r\nhonesty, sincerity, firmness, and moral intrepidity.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] \"The Jeff. Davis speech,\" March 3, 1879.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN CONSPIRACY--THE ELECTION OF ABRAHAM\r\nLINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler became a Senator of the United States at the time when\r\nthe Southern followers of John C. Calhoun had determined that the\r\npreservation of slavery was impossible without disunion, and had\r\ncommenced preparations for that desperate measure of defense. The heavy\r\nvote given to Fremont in the North, the failure of the attempt to plant\r\nslavery in Kansas, the widening schism in the Democracy itself on\r\nthe issue of slavery-extension, and the certainty that the census of\r\n1860 would greatly increase the voting power in Congress of the North\r\nand Northwest--all made it plain that the South could not reinforce\r\nits waning strength with new slave States. Its leaders saw that the\r\nalternative before them was a systematic repression of slavery pointing\r\ntoward its ultimate extinction, or the creation of a new government\r\npretending to be a republic but \"with its foundations laid, its\r\ncorner-stone resting upon, the great truth that the negro is not equal\r\nto the white man, that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is\r\nhis natural and normal condition.\"[8] Every civilized instinct urged\r\nthem to assent to peaceful and gradual emancipation, but they chose the\r\nalternative of disunion from a belief that in no other way could the\r\npolitical ascendancy so long enjoyed by the ruling classes of the South\r\nbe maintained. The administration of James Buchanan was their period\r\nof preparation. Whatever of needed assistance his sympathy failed to\r\nsupply was furnished by his imbecility of purpose. In his Cabinet and\r\nin federal offices throughout the South active disunionists plotted\r\nand labored to make all things ready for rebellion and unready for\r\nits suppression. Chronic compromisers, Northern believers in slavery,\r\nand State Rights theorists were their useful allies. In Congress they\r\nthreatened and bullied, and month by month made the demands of slavery\r\nmore arrogant and exacting, scheming to kindle the war spirit of the\r\nSouth and to widen the breach between the sections, until they could\r\noffer to the North the ultimatum of abject surrender to the slave\r\npower or disunion and civil strife. The representatives of the North\r\nat Washington met these early developments of treason in various\r\nmoods; there was no lack among them of those who were inclined to\r\nsubmit; there were many who disbelieved in the reality of the purpose\r\nunderlying Southern vaporing and bluster, and this class included\r\nearnest and able Republicans; but there were also some who did not\r\ndoubt that the slave power would try secession before accepting defeat,\r\nand who, yielding not one inch of the right to menaces, proposed to\r\ntreat disunion, whether threatened or attempted, as treason and to\r\ndenounce and resist it as such.\r\n\r\nEarly in his Senatorial career Mr. Chandler became convinced that\r\nthe purpose of rebellion was a well-defined one at the South, that\r\npreparations to make it successful were in active progress, and that\r\nthe longer the crisis was delayed the more difficult would be the\r\ntask of its suppression. Between 1857 and 1861 his comments to his\r\nintimate friends on the outlook were exceedingly gloomy, and he often\r\ndeclared that he saw no possible escape from war. If the government\r\nwas to be maintained on the basis on which it was founded and was\r\nnot to be revolutionized in the interest of slavery, he believed\r\nthat an armed conflict with the men who had determined to change its\r\ncharacter was inevitable. He did not underestimate their ambition,\r\ntheir desperateness of purpose, or their readiness for violence.\r\nBut neither in public nor in private did he quail before them in any\r\ndegree, and his only plan of action was the simple, straightforward and\r\ncharacteristic one of meeting their threats with defiance and their\r\ntreason with all the force required for its punishment. In a time of\r\nvacillation, feebleness and moral cowardice, and while he was still\r\nnew in the Senate and hampered by his own inexperience and the usages\r\nof that body, what he did say and all his acts and influence were\r\nimportant contributions to that invigorating of Northern sentiment\r\nwhich the times so greatly demanded and which alone made possible the\r\nnational uprising of 1861.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of record, the first time Zachariah Chandler's voice\r\nwas heard in the Senate chamber, he asked that \"Cornelius O'Flynn\r\nhave leave to withdraw his memorial and papers from the files of the\r\nSenate.\" The first caucus he attended was that in which the Republican\r\nminority decided to make a vigorous protest against the unfairness\r\nof its treatment in the appointment of the Senate committees of the\r\nThirty-fifth Congress. In his first speech he added, on the floor\r\nof the Senate, to the protest of his party an equally vigorous\r\nremonstrance against the complete ignoring of the commercial importance\r\nof the Northwest in the selection of members of the Committee on\r\nCommerce. In his second speech (on the proposition to increase the\r\narmy) he said in significant language: \"If they will show to me that\r\nthey require a force in Utah to put down rebellion I will vote for it,\r\nI care not whether it be one regiment or one hundred regiments.\" His\r\nfirst prepared address in the Senate was delivered on the 12th day\r\nof March, 1858, and had as its theme that most reckless of the slave\r\npower's efforts at self-extension, the attempt to force upon Kansas\r\nwhat was known as the Lecompton constitution.\r\n\r\nThis was a pro-slavery instrument, framed by a constitutional\r\nconvention elected and controlled by Border-Ruffians, apparently\r\nratified at an election whose managers allowed no one to vote against\r\nit but only to vote for it with slavery or for it without slavery (even\r\nthe \"without\" was fraudulent, because property in slaves already in\r\nKansas was in any event guaranteed until 1864), and overwhelmingly\r\nrejected at the only election which in any degree fairly represented\r\nthe opinions of the genuine settlers of the territory. Mr. Chandler's\r\nspeech on this topic, the absorbing one of that day, was prepared with\r\nmuch care and delivered from manuscript. Portions of it were read to\r\nSenators Cameron, Wade and Hamlin before it was uttered. While it was\r\nspoken with the impulsive manner that generally characterized his\r\nspeeches, it was the result of long deliberation and of such careful\r\nstudy of phraseology as was necessary to make it explicit and forcible.\r\nIt was listened to by a large audience. Mr. Chandler had in private\r\nconversation spoken with much vigor of the duty of the Republican party\r\nin case the Lecompton constitution of Kansas was accepted and the new\r\nState admitted under that instrument, and his remarks had been freely\r\nquoted. His reputation for radicalism of opinion and plainness of\r\nspeech had also reached Washington, and there was a general interest\r\nfelt in his first prepared address. He began speaking about fifteen\r\nminutes after the Senate was called to order (in the chamber now\r\noccupied by the Supreme Court) and held the floor for nearly three\r\nhours. The spectators included many members of the House, among them\r\nJohn Sherman, since Senator and Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander\r\nH. Stephens, afterward Vice-President of the Confederacy, and John A.\r\nLogan, now well-known as both soldier and Senator. The address was\r\none of power and was attended by marked effect.[9] It contained this\r\ndescription of the fate of three Michigan emigrants to Kansas:\r\n\r\n  Men have been hunted down by sheriffs and by _posses_ from other\r\n  States, by border-ruffians--everywhere under the color of law. Sir,\r\n  the State of Michigan has over a thousand of her people in Kansas\r\n  to-day. Three of her citizens, and many other good men, have been\r\n  murdered in cold blood. Two of them, Barbour and Brown, I know\r\n  were as good men as can be found on the face of the earth. The\r\n  other--Gay--was Mr. Pierce's Land Agent for the territory. He was a\r\n  Nebraska pro-slavery Democrat. He was met one day, with his son, on\r\n  the road, and asked whether he was for Free-State or pro-slavery.\r\n  He had become a little Free-Statish in his views, and, not dreaming\r\n  of danger, he said: \"I am a Free-State man,\" and he was shot down,\r\n  and his son, in attempting to defend his father, received a bullet\r\n  in his hip, and is now a cripple in Michigan. I speak with some\r\n  feeling. My own constituents, my own people, have been brutally\r\n  murdered, and I should be recreant to my trust if I did not speak\r\n  with feeling on this subject. I know the men from Michigan who are\r\n  in Kansas to be as good men as can be found within these United\r\n  States, and when any one says the emigrants from Michigan to the\r\n  territory of Kansas are picked from the purlieus of cities I tell\r\n  him he knows nothing about the subject and that it is not true.\r\n  They are as good men as the State of Michigan produces; they are\r\n  honest and brave; they know their rights and, knowing, dare defend\r\n  them.\r\n\r\nBut those parts of the speech which most thoroughly stirred his hearers\r\nand fell with unaccustomed force on ears which rarely heard such\r\ndefiant tones, were these:\r\n\r\n  I cannot permit this bill to pass without protest. It was conceived\r\n  and executed in fraud.... It is one of the series of aggressions on\r\n  the part of the slave power which, if permitted to be consummated,\r\n  must end in the subversion of the constitution and the Union.... It\r\n  strikes a death-blow at State sovereignty and popular rights....\r\n  When Missouri applied for admission as a slave State ... the North\r\n  objected. They declared it was agreed to that no more slave States\r\n  should be admitted into the Union.... Agitation ran high. The South\r\n  then as now threatened a dissolution of the Union. The North then\r\n  as now denied her power to dissolve it.... During this excitement\r\n  the hearts of brave men quailed.... A new compromise was made....\r\n  As a part of this compromise slavery was forever prohibited north\r\n  of 36° 30'.... The compromise was acquiesced in.... Peace again\r\n  reigned through the land, ... and this peace continued until the\r\n  discovery of the new doctrine of popular sovereignty.... This is\r\n  called a new compromise.... We are told we must accept it because\r\n  the Union is in danger.... But that set of people who have been\r\n  in labor and suffering and trial for so long a time on account of\r\n  the Union have passed off the stage. In their places are men who\r\n  love this glorious Union and love it as it was made by the fathers;\r\n  men who will not whine \"danger to the Union,\" but brave men who\r\n  will fight for this Union to the death.... The old women of the\r\n  North who have been in the habit of crying out \"the Union is in\r\n  danger\" have passed off the stage. They are dead. Their places will\r\n  never be supplied, but in their stead we have a race of men who\r\n  are devoted to this Union and devoted to it as Jefferson and the\r\n  fathers made it and bequeathed it to us.\r\n\r\n  Any aggression upon the constitution has been submitted to by the\r\n  race who have gone off the stage. They were ready to compromise any\r\n  principle, any thing. The men of the present day are a different\r\n  race. They will compromise nothing; they are Union-loving men; they\r\n  love all portions of the Union; and they will sacrifice anything\r\n  but principle to save it. They will, however, make no sacrifice of\r\n  principle. Never! Never! No more compromises will ever be submitted\r\n  to to save the Union! If it is worth saving, it will be saved; but\r\n  if you sap and undermine its foundations it must topple. It will be\r\n  the legitimate result of your own action. The only way that we ever\r\n  shall save this Union and make it as permanent as the everlasting\r\n  hills will be by restoring it to the original foundations upon\r\n  which the fathers placed it....\r\n\r\n  The people of Kansas are almost unanimously opposed to this\r\n  constitution; yet you propose to force it upon them without their\r\n  consent. It cannot be done. The government has not bayonets enough\r\n  to force a constitution upon the necks of any unwilling people....\r\n  It is our purpose to avoid the shedding of blood upon the soil of\r\n  the United States by civil war. While I will not charge on the\r\n  supporters of the Lecompton constitution the purpose, in civil\r\n  war, of shedding blood upon the soil of the United States, I do\r\n  charge that they, and they alone, will be responsible for every\r\n  drop of blood that may be shed in consequence of the adoption of\r\n  that constitution. I trust in God civil war will never come; but\r\n  if it should come, upon their heads, and theirs alone, will rest\r\n  the responsibility of every drop that may flow. I trust in God that\r\n  this question will never be pushed to that extremity, for I would\r\n  have less respect for the people of Kansas than I now have if I\r\n  supposed they would tamely submit to have a constitution thrust\r\n  down their throats without authority of law, and against law,\r\n  without making resistance. I would disown them as the descendants\r\n  of the men who fought our revolutionary battles if I did not think\r\n  they would resist any illegal attempts to force a constitution upon\r\n  them.\r\n\r\nA speech of such vigor of opinion was not without marked effect. There\r\nwas a disposition among the less radical Republicans to rate it as\r\nimprudent, and there were some attempts at rebuking Mr. Chandler for\r\nbeing so outspoken. He received these criticisms good-humoredly, but\r\nfelt confident of his position and constantly defended it. The effect\r\nof his demonstration on the Democratic side was marked; the new Senator\r\nfrom Michigan surprised his political opponents by the directness and\r\nforce of his attack, but won from them the respect always accorded\r\nto boldness and candor. Mr. Chandler also showed spirit on little as\r\nwell as great occasions. In the latter part of the following April,\r\nthe Democrats attempted to coerce the Republicans into voting upon the\r\nsame bill for the admission of Kansas. Without any ill-temper, but with\r\nno lack of earnestness, Mr. Chandler arose, and said: \"I understand\r\ngentlemen on the other side to say that no adjournment shall take place\r\nuntil this question is disposed of. If that is their determination I\r\ncan assure them that no adjournment will take place until the 7th of\r\nJune. When I say that no adjournment will take place until that time,\r\nI mean what I say. I propose to take a recess until 9 o'clock, and I\r\nadvise gentlemen to bid farewell to their families for thirty days at\r\nleast.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1858 fuel was added to the anti-slavery flame by the Dred Scott\r\ndecision, in which the majority of the Judges of the Supreme Court\r\naffirmed, that as a matter of history the negroes at the time of the\r\nformation of the constitution \"had no rights which the white man was\r\nbound to respect,\" that as a principle of law neither emancipated\r\nslaves nor the emancipated descendants of slaves were entitled to\r\nclaim the rights and privileges which the constitution provides for\r\nand secures to citizens of the United States, and that under a correct\r\nconstitutional construction acts excluding slavery from the territories\r\nwere without validity. This utterance was rendered especially obnoxious\r\nby the fact that the court, while leaving Dred Scott in slavery on the\r\nground that the United States tribunals had no jurisdiction in his\r\ncase, practically asserted jurisdiction for the purpose of deciding\r\n(outside of the real issues of the trial as limited by its own\r\nfinding) that Congress could not exclude slavery from the territories.\r\nIn reference to this decision Mr. Chandler said in the Senate on the\r\n17th of February, 1859:\r\n\r\n  What did General Jackson do when the Supreme Court declared the\r\n  United States Bank constitutional? Did he bow in deference to\r\n  the opinion of the court? No, ... he said he would construe the\r\n  constitution for himself, that he was sworn to do it. I shall do\r\n  the same thing. I have sworn to support the Constitution of the\r\n  United States, and I have sworn to support it as the fathers made\r\n  it and not as the Supreme Court have altered it. And I never will\r\n  swear allegiance to that.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1859, \"Old John Brown\" made his memorable attempt to\r\nliberate the enslaved negroes of the South by the descent upon Harper's\r\nFerry. The rashness of his unaided attack on a giant wrong is protected\r\nfrom ridicule by a heroism worthy of Thermopylæ and by a death which\r\nSidney's last hours did not surpass in moral grandeur. Mr. Chandler,\r\nwith deep respect for Brown's motives and the unique simplicity of\r\nhis character, was earnest in condemnation of his methods and of the\r\nutter foolhardiness of his effort. Congress was not in session when\r\nBrown seized Harper's Ferry and convulsed Virginia with fright, and Mr.\r\nChandler was not in Washington. When Congress did meet in December,\r\nBrown had just been hanged, and the excitement was still feverish. A\r\nSenate committee, consisting of Mason of Virginia, Jefferson Davis,\r\nFitch of Indiana, Democrats, and Collamer and Doolittle, Republicans,\r\nwas at once appointed to investigate the raid, and while the resolution\r\nproviding for it was under consideration Mr. Chandler made one of his\r\ntelling speeches. In it he thus ridiculed \"the reign of terror\" at the\r\nSouth:\r\n\r\n  Senators ask us why we have no sympathy with Virginia in this\r\n  instance. Sir, we do not understand this case at all. What are the\r\n  facts? Seventeen white men and five unwilling negroes surround\r\n  and capture a town of 2,000 people, with a United States armory,\r\n  any quantity of arms and ammunition, and with 300 men employed in\r\n  it--as I am informed, employed in it under a civil officer--and\r\n  hold it for two days. These I understand to be the facts, and you\r\n  ask, Why have we not sympathy? We do not understand any such case\r\n  as that. The Senator from Mississippi (Mr. Brown) asks, What would\r\n  we say if North Carolina and Virginia were to attack the armory at\r\n  Springfield? I do not know what is the population of Springfield,\r\n  but I will guarantee if any seventeen or twenty-two of the Generals\r\n  ... of the States of Virginia and North Carolina were to attack\r\n  Springfield, if there was not a man within five miles of there, the\r\n  women would bind them in thirty minutes and would not ask sympathy\r\n  and the matter would not be deemed of sufficient importance to ask\r\n  for a committee of investigation on the part of the corporation.\r\n  Why, sir, Governor Wise compared the people of Harper's Ferry to\r\n  sheep, as the public press state. That is a libel on the sheep. For\r\n  I never saw a flock of fifty or a hundred sheep in my life that had\r\n  not a belligerent ram among them. We do not understand any such\r\n  panic as this. If seventeen or one hundred men were to attack a\r\n  town of the size of Harper's Ferry anywhere throughout the region\r\n  with which I am acquainted, they would simply be put in jail in\r\n  thirty minutes, and then they would be tried for their crimes and\r\n  they would be punished and there would be no row made about it.\r\n\r\nThe pointed passage of the speech was the one in which he thanked a\r\nSouthern Governor for demonstrating so conspicuously that treason was a\r\ncrime punishable by death. He said,\r\n\r\n  I am in favor of the resolution because the first execution for\r\n  treason that has ever occurred in the United States has just taken\r\n  place. John Brown has been executed as a traitor in the State of\r\n  Virginia, and I want it to go upon the records of the Senate in\r\n  the most solemn manner to be held up as a warning to traitors,\r\n  come they from the North, South, East or West. Dare to raise your\r\n  impious hands against this government, its constitution and its\r\n  laws--and you hang!... Threats have been made year after year for\r\n  the last thirty years, that if certain events happen this Union\r\n  will be dissolved. It is no small matter to dissolve this Union.\r\n  It means a bloody revolution or it means a halter. It means the\r\n  successful overturn of this government or it means the fate of John\r\n  Brown, and I want that to go solemnly on the record of this Senate!\r\n\r\nThese were the speeches of a man untried in public life and still in\r\nthe early years of his first Congressional term. The Senate which\r\nhe thus addressed listened also to Charles Sumner's magnificent\r\nphilippics--blows \"struck with the club of Hercules entwined with\r\nflowers,\" to the philosophic eloquence of Seward in his moral prime, to\r\nWade's sturdy fearlessness of speech, to the wit of Hale, and to the\r\nvigorous oratory of Fessenden. But no man measured more accurately\r\nthan Zachariah Chandler the political forces of that day, no man\r\nbranded the hatching treason with his blunt precision and homely power,\r\nand no man asserted with more boldness the courage and the purpose\r\nof the North. In that hour resolute words were useful in themselves;\r\nbut the lapse of twenty years has shown that Mr. Chandler was then as\r\nclear-sighted as he was intrepid in spirit and plain in speech.\r\n\r\nThis unsparing denunciation of treason to plotting traitors was not\r\nwithout personal peril. Mr. Chandler became a Senator at a time when\r\nthe South had unleashed its brutality at Washington and regarded\r\nresistance to its demands as justifying violence and insult. Horace\r\nGreeley, while visiting Washington, was assaulted and injured in the\r\nCapitol grounds by Rust of Arkansas, on account of some criticisms\r\nin the _Tribune_ on Congressional action. Preston Brooks committed\r\n(on the 22d of May, 1856) his assault on Charles Sumner in the Senate\r\nchamber, a crime which was publicly upheld by Toombs, Slidell, Davis\r\nand other Southern leaders, and which led South Carolina to unanimously\r\nre-elect the ruffian to the House when he resigned after the adoption\r\nof a vote of censure. Henry Wilson's denunciation of this attack upon\r\nhis colleague as \"brutal, murderous, and cowardly\" was followed by a\r\nchallenge from Brooks, to which he responded by arming himself and\r\nby a note declaring that while he repudiated the duelling code he\r\n\"religiously believed in the right of self-defense in the broadest\r\nsense.\" John Woodruff, a Connecticut Representative, having stigmatized\r\nBrooks's act as a \"mean achievement of cowardice,\" was tendered a\r\nduelling challenge which he declined to receive. Anson Burlingame\r\npursued another course. Of the assault on the Massachusetts Senator,\r\nhe said: \"I denounce it in the name of the constitution it violates. I\r\ndenounce it in the name of the sovereignty of Massachusetts, which was\r\nstricken down by the blow. I denounce it in the name of humanity. I\r\ndenounce it in the name of civilization, which it outraged. I denounce\r\nit in the name of that fair play which bullies and prize-fighters\r\nrespect.\" To this the response was a challenge from Brooks, which\r\nMr. Burlingame accepted, and, selecting Canada as the spot for the\r\nmeeting, had the satisfaction of seeing the representative of South\r\nCarolina chivalry refuse to abide by the code he had himself invoked.\r\nWilliam McKee Dunn, of Indiana, was challenged by Rust, of Arkansas,\r\nfor words spoken in the House, and, naming \"rifles at sixty paces\" as\r\nthe weapons, learned that such was not the \"satisfaction\" desired by\r\nSouthern \"gentlemen.\" Owen Lovejoy denounced the crimes of slavery\r\nin front of the Speaker's desk in the House, with the fists of angry\r\nSoutherners shaking in his face, and amid their yells and threats.\r\nPotter, of Wisconsin, cooled off the hot blood of Roger A. Pryor by\r\naccepting his duelling challenge and selecting bowie-knives as the\r\nweapons. Amid all this there was much chronic servility among Northern\r\nmembers to Southern insolence, which gave pungent force to Thaddeus\r\nStevens's sarcasm (uttered during the prolonged contest over the\r\nSpeakership of the Thirty-sixth Congress) that he could not blame the\r\nSouth for trying intimidation, for they had \"tried it fifty times and\r\nfifty times, and had always found weak and recreant tremblers in the\r\nNorth.\" Mr. Chandler entered the Senate with the firm resolution that\r\nhe would not be bullied, that he would not submit to bluster, and that\r\nif occasion came he would fight without hesitation. His decision did\r\nnot spring from love of quarrel or mere passion, but was the fruit\r\nof mature reflection and was based upon a clear purpose. He saw that\r\nthe Southerners in Congress vapored and threatened for effect; that\r\nthey believed that Northern men would not fight, and that they would\r\nbe permitted to offer unlimited insults without arousing resentment.\r\nThe public sentiment of the North was against duelling or fisticuffs,\r\nand the Southerners supposed--and sincerely--that this was the result\r\nof cowardice and not of conscience. This condition of opinion was of\r\ndecided assistance to the conspirators who were plotting disunion at\r\nthe South, and the stigma of pusillanimity was the source of no little\r\npractical weakness with the North. Under these circumstances Mr.\r\nChandler fully determined--as did Mr. Wade, Mr. Hamlin, Mr. Cameron,\r\nand one or two other Senators--that if occasion offered, so that\r\njustice should be clearly upon his side, he would fight. This was a\r\ndeliberate purpose, not reached through any admiration for fighting\r\nmen, nor through belief in force as a method of argument, but from\r\na conviction that the moral effect of such a demonstration of the\r\npersonal courage of Northern representatives would be of service to the\r\nnation. Mr. Chandler knew himself to be physically capable of meeting\r\nalmost any assailant; he prepared himself for a collision by muscular\r\nexercise and the practice of marksmanship, and, while he did not seek,\r\nhe made no effort to avoid, an encounter.\r\n\r\nOn February 5, 1858, there was a personal altercation in the House of\r\nRepresentatives between Galusha A. Grow, of Pennsylvania, afterward\r\nSpeaker, and Lawrence M. Keitt, of South Carolina, who was killed in\r\nbattle, during the rebellion, at the head of a Confederate brigade.\r\nMr. Harris of Illinois, an Anti-Nebraska Democrat, had offered a\r\nresolution for the appointment of a committee to ascertain by an\r\ninvestigation whether the Lecompton constitution was the work in any\r\njust sense of the people of Kansas. Coming from such a source, the\r\nresolution would have received a majority of votes in the House,\r\nbut its opponents resorted to parliamentary stratagem to prevent\r\nits passage, \"filibustering\" for several hours. Amid the attending\r\nexcitement there was a very heated colloquy between Grow and Keitt,\r\nwhich ended in blows on both sides, Keitt being the first to strike.\r\nGrow resisted, and a general melee followed which was participated\r\nin by many members. The affair was afterward adjusted, and both\r\napologized to the House but without apologizing to each other. This\r\noccurrence impressed Mr. Chandler deeply, and, as soon as he heard of\r\nit, he went to the Hall of Representatives, and assured Mr. Grow of\r\nhis approval and his readiness to render any desired aid. It was the\r\nfirst outbreak of the kind which came within his personal observation,\r\nand confirmed him in his belief that it was the duty of the Northern\r\nminority to resist all encroachments upon their personal and official\r\nrights. Not long afterward a colloquy occurred in the Senate between\r\nSimon Cameron and Senator Green of Missouri, in which the lie was\r\ngiven, and only the prompt interference of Vice-President Breckenridge,\r\nwho was in the chair, prevented a personal altercation. The Democrats\r\nwere insisting upon a vote upon the bill to admit Kansas under the\r\nLecompton constitution, while the Republicans were endeavoring to\r\nsecure longer time for debate. It was about 4 o'clock in the morning\r\nwhen the offensive words were exchanged. Vice-President Breckenridge\r\nat once rapped with his gavel, and commanded both Green and Cameron\r\nto take their seats. After order had been restored, Senator Green\r\ncontinued his remarks, and, referring to Cameron, said: \"I will not\r\nuse a harsh word now; it will be out of order. But if I get out of\r\nthis Senate chamber I shall use a harsh word in his (Cameron's) teeth,\r\nfor there no rule of order will correct me.... As to any question of\r\nveracity between that Senator and myself, in five minutes after the\r\nSenate adjourns we can settle it.\" Mr. Cameron's reply was: \"I desire\r\nto say, if these remarks are intended as a threat, they have no effect\r\nupon me.\" The debate was continued at length, but a small group of\r\nSenators was soon after seen in earnest conference in a cloak-room. It\r\nwas composed of Senators Chandler, Cameron, Wade and Broderick, and\r\nthe result of the consultation was, that by the advice of his friends\r\nMr. Cameron armed himself, and prepared for self-defense in case he\r\nwas attacked by Green. The Senate remained in continuous session for\r\nover eighteen hours, and for some time after the quarrel. Meanwhile Mr.\r\nGreen's passion cooled, and the expected collision did not take place\r\n(explanations were ultimately made by both in the Senate chamber). But\r\nwhen the Senate adjourned, Mr. Chandler accompanied Mr. Cameron to his\r\nlodgings, as a measure of precaution. Out of this affair grew a formal\r\nagreement between Mr. Chandler, Mr. Cameron and Mr. Wade, which was\r\nreduced to writing, and sealed with the understanding that its contents\r\nshould not be made public until after the death of all the signers. His\r\ncopy of this historic document is still among Mr. Chandlers papers,\r\nbut it will not be made public while Mr. Cameron lives. Of its purport\r\none,[10] who knew intimately the men and the circumstances and motives\r\nof this act, has written:\r\n\r\n  The assaults of the violent Southern leaders upon some of\r\n  the ablest and purest Republicans in the Senate, known to be\r\n  non-combatants, finally became unbearable to some of the less\r\n  scrupulous Republicans, until, in the midst of one of the most\r\n  denunciatory tirades of one of the fire-eaters, there was noticed\r\n  a little group of the lately-admitted Republicans in a side\r\n  consultation on the floor of the Senate. Precisely what was said in\r\n  consultation is not known to the writer, nor is it likely that it\r\n  will transpire during the lifetime of either of the three gentlemen\r\n  engaged. It is, however, known that the group was composed of\r\n  Senators Wade, Cameron, and Chandler; that it was agreed between\r\n  them substantially that the business of insulting Republican\r\n  Senators on the floor of the Senate had gone far enough, and that\r\n  it must cease; and further, that, in case of any renewed insolence\r\n  to any other Republican Senator of the character which had been\r\n  practiced, it should be the duty of one of the three to take up the\r\n  quarrel and make it his own to the full extent of the code--to the\r\n  death if it need be. The compact was not only made, but signed and\r\n  sealed, and remains sealed to this day. Its import, however, became\r\n  known, and the demeanor of the Southern fire-eaters, though still\r\n  violent and disloyal, soon after became courteous personally toward\r\n  Republican Senators.\r\n\r\n  They did, however, feel around a little to ascertain whether the\r\n  whisperings as to the fighting Senators could be relied on. They\r\n  had a scheme to assault Senator Chandler in the street, but a\r\n  little inquiry as to his strength and skill led to its sudden\r\n  abandonment. A blustering Southerner took offense at the remarks\r\n  of Senator Wade, who had said in relation to an assertion made by\r\n  him, that such a statement would only come from a liar or a coward.\r\n  Of course this could not be borne by the high-toned cavalier, and\r\n  his friend, or agent, or servitor called on Senator Wade, not with\r\n  a formal challenge, but to ascertain how Wade would probably act\r\n  in the event of a challenge. As soon as Wade pierced the diplomacy\r\n  of the agent so far as to become aware of his purpose, he told him\r\n  to tell the old coward that he dare not fight. This was not quite\r\n  satisfactory. The agent or spy seemed anxious to know what kind of\r\n  weapons Wade would choose in case of a contest. On learning this,\r\n  Wade said, \"rifles at twenty paces, with a white paper the size of\r\n  a dollar pinned over the heart of each combatant; and tell him, if\r\n  I do not hit the one on his breast at the first shot, he may fire\r\n  at me all day.\"\r\n\r\n  These inquiries seemed to cure all further desire on the part of\r\n  the chivalry for personal combats. Threats, however, continued to\r\n  be made of street assaults and caning, generally pointing to the\r\n  more prominent of the non-combatants in the Republican ranks.\r\n\r\n  Certain of the Republicans went thoroughly armed all the time,\r\n  and these, for weeks together, took turns in walking with their\r\n  non-belligerent colleagues to and from the Capitol, to protect them\r\n  from personal assault.\r\n\r\nThe decided practical value of Mr. Chandler's bearing at that time\r\nand of his known determination to maintain his official and personal\r\nrights at all physical hazards cannot be doubted. It made itself\r\nfelt among his associates on both sides of the Senate chamber, and\r\nearned for him early recognition at Washington as a bold and staunch\r\nleader of his party. Personal influence was the natural outgrowth\r\nof positive qualities so fearlessly displayed, and he became a man\r\nwhose opinions were sought and whose energy in execution was prized\r\nby his fellow-Senators. A close personal intimacy with Mr. Wade, Mr.\r\nHamlin and Mr. Cameron sprang up at this time, and general agreement\r\nof opinion on public questions led them into concerted action as\r\nrepresentatives of the more \"radical\" element. Much of their work was\r\nbeneath the surface and is not a matter of record, but the results of\r\ntheir efforts at that crisis to infuse vigor by all possible means into\r\nthe lifeless national sentiment of the North and to prepare the people\r\nfor the coming struggle were important and durable.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler was heard with interest during the sessions of 1858-59-60\r\non other questions than those connected with the conflict over slavery.\r\nHis speech (on Feb. 17, 1859) in opposition to the bill appropriating\r\n$30,000,000 to \"facilitate the acquisition of Cuba by negotiation\"\r\nattracted some attention. Its scope and tenor will appear from this\r\nextract:\r\n\r\n  This is a most extraordinary proposition to be presented to the\r\n  Congress of the United States at this time. With a Treasury\r\n  bankrupt, and the government borrowing money to pay its expenses,\r\n  and no efficient remedy proposed for that state of things; with\r\n  your great national works in the Northwest going to decay, and\r\n  no money to repair them; without harbors of refuge for your\r\n  commerce, and no money to construct them; with a national debt of\r\n  $70,000,000, which is increasing, in a time of profound peace,\r\n  at the rate of $30,000,000 per annum--the Senate of the United\r\n  States is startled by a proposition to borrow $30,000,000. And\r\n  for what, sir? To pay just claims against the government, which\r\n  have been long deferred? No, sir; you have no money for any\r\n  such purpose as that. Is it to repair your national works on\r\n  the Northwestern lakes, to repair your harbors, to rebuild your\r\n  light-houses? No, sir; you have no money for that. Is it to build\r\n  a railroad to the Pacific, connecting the Eastern and Western\r\n  slopes of this Continent by bands of iron, and open up the vast\r\n  interior of the Continent to settlement? No, sir; you say that\r\n  is unconstitutional. What, then, do you propose to do with this\r\n  $30,000,000? Is it to purchase the island of Cuba? No, sir; for\r\n  you are already advised in advance that Spain will not sell the\r\n  island; more, sir, you are advised in advance that she will take a\r\n  proposition for its purchase as a national insult, to be rejected\r\n  with scorn and contempt. The action of her Cortes and of her\r\n  government, on the reception of the President's message, proves\r\n  this beyond all controversy. What, then, do you propose to do with\r\n  this $30,000,000?... It is a great corruption fund for bribery and\r\n  for bribery only.... But let us admit for the sake of argument\r\n  that this proposition is brought forward in good faith and will be\r\n  successfully terminated. What do any of the Northwestern States\r\n  gain by the purchase of this island of Cuba? I know something of\r\n  Cuba, something of its soil, something of the climate, something of\r\n  its people, their manners and customs, something of their religion\r\n  and something of their crimes. I spent a winter in the interior\r\n  of the island of Cuba a few years since and can, therefore, speak\r\n  from personal knowledge.... Much of the soil of the island is rich\r\n  and exceedingly productive, but it is in no way comparable to the\r\n  prairies and bottom lands of the great West. You can go into almost\r\n  any of your territories and select an equal number of acres and\r\n  you will have a more valuable State than you can possibly make out\r\n  of Cuba.... You propose to pay $200,000,000 for the island, $10 an\r\n  acre for every acre of land on it.... You are selling infinitely\r\n  better lands, and have millions upon millions of acres of them, at\r\n  $1.25 per acre. You propose to pay $200,000,000--nearly $200 a head\r\n  for every man, woman and child, including negroes, on the island.\r\n  And for what? For the right to govern one million of the refuse of\r\n  the earth.\r\n\r\nDuring this same period Mr. Chandler was very active in helping on the\r\nwork of Republican organization throughout the country. In the campaign\r\nof 1858 in Michigan, he spoke repeatedly in the larger towns of that\r\nState, great audiences gathering to hear him, and answering with\r\ngrowing enthusiasm his vigorous attacks on the administration and its\r\nmaster, the slave power. The result was that Moses Wisner, Republican,\r\nwas elected Governor by a vote of 65,202 to 56,067 for Charles E.\r\nStuart, Democrat. The Republicans also carried every Congressional\r\ndistrict (William A. Howard obtained his seat after a contest with\r\nGeorge B. Cooper) and had a large majority in both branches of the\r\nLegislature. That body, on meeting in January, 1859, elected Kinsley\r\nS. Bingham to the Senate, and Michigan has always since that year been\r\nrepresented in the upper branch of Congress by two Republicans. Charles\r\nE. Stuart, whom Mr. Bingham succeeded, was a man of ability who had\r\nmanfully refused to support the Lecompton outrage, and with Stephen A.\r\nDouglas and David C. Broderick had been classed as an Anti-Nebraska\r\nDemocrat. Mr. Bingham was a thorough Republican, and during his brief\r\nSenatorial term (he died in October, 1861,) stood side by side with his\r\ncolleague on all political questions.\r\n\r\nIn the Presidential campaign of 1860 Mr. Chandler labored with untiring\r\nzeal to secure Mr. Lincoln's election. Early in the fall he spoke with\r\nmarked effect in the State of New York. Throughout August, September,\r\nand October he addressed a series of great mass-meetings at different\r\npoints in Michigan (at Hillsdale 8,000 people gathered to hear him,\r\nat Cassopolis 10,000, at Paw Paw 5,000, and at Kalamazoo 20,000).\r\nIn October he visited Illinois, speaking at Mr. Lincoln's home\r\n(Springfield) on the 17th of that month.[11] His last speech in that\r\ncampaign was made in the Republican wigwam at Detroit on November 1,\r\nand was alive with the spirit of victory and the firm purpose to secure\r\nits rewards. On the day of election his State answered his appeals with\r\nan increased Republican majority, giving Lincoln 88,480 votes to 65,057\r\nfor Douglas, 805 for Breckenridge, and 405 for Bell.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] Speech of Alexander H. Stephens at Savannah on March 21, 1861,\r\nafter his election to the rebel Vice-Presidency.\r\n\r\n[9] Of this speech the New York _Courier and Enquirer_ said: \"The\r\nspeech of Mr. Chandler on the 12th places him among the first debaters\r\nof the country. No more unanswerable exposition of the usurpation in\r\nKansas has been made.\" The Chicago _Tribune_ said: \"Mr. Chandler made\r\nhis first formal speech in the Senate to-day. That body paid him the\r\ncompliment of unwavering attention through the whole of his able and\r\neffective speech. The passage in which he described the murder of\r\nBrown, Barbour and Gay ... excited the sympathies and passions of his\r\naudience to a pitch rarely observed in parliamentary debate.\"\r\n\r\n[10] The Hon. James M. Edmunds, for many years Commissioner of the Land\r\nOffice, and afterward postmaster of the Senate and of Washington City.\r\n\r\n[11] The Springfield _Journal_ of October 18 said: \"Senator Chandler,\r\nof Michigan, made yesterday one of the best speeches to which our\r\ncitizens have had the pleasure of listening during the campaign.... The\r\nmeeting was a magnificent one and the greatest enthusiasm prevailed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nSERVICES TO THE CAUSE OF THE PROTECTION OF HOME INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nZachariah Chandler as a Republican Senator was a thorough Whig in\r\nboth his advocacy of an enlightened national system of Internal\r\nImprovements and his constant and efficient championship of the cause\r\nof the Protection of American Industries. It has been justly said that\r\n\"the Great West of to-day owes its unequaled growth and progress, its\r\npopulation, productiveness and wealth, primarily, to the framers of the\r\nfederal constitution, by which its development was rendered possible,\r\nbut more immediately and palpably to the sagacity and statesmanship\r\nof Jefferson, the purchaser of Louisiana; to the genius of Fitch and\r\nFulton, the projector and achiever, respectively, of steam navigation;\r\nto De Witt Clinton, the early, unswerving and successful champion\r\nof artificial inland navigation; and to Henry Clay, the eminent,\r\neloquent, and effective champion of the diversification of our national\r\nindustry through the Protection of Home Manufactures.\" No man knew\r\nbetter or acknowledged more fully the truth of this analysis than\r\nMr. Chandler. His own State abounded with evidences of its justice,\r\nand his firm faith in the protective principle was also strengthened\r\nby the teachings of his practical mercantile experience and by his\r\ngeneral commercial sagacity. No State presents to-day more abundant\r\nproofs of the beneficence of \"the American system\" than Michigan, and\r\nno personal contributions to the protection of its interests and the\r\ndiversification of its industries equaled those given on every possible\r\noccasion by Mr. Chandler throughout his prolonged Senatorial service.\r\n\r\nPolitical economy has been well defined as \"the science of labor-saving\r\napplied to the action of communities, its aim being to save labor\r\nfrom waste, from misapplication, and from loss through constrained\r\nidleness.\" The objects of Protection are the ennobling of labor and\r\nthe enhancing of its productiveness, and its method is interdicting\r\nan unwholesome competition which looks no farther than securing mere\r\ncheapness of production at whatever cost of human energy, comfort\r\nand enlightenment. There has never been an intelligent and sincere\r\nprotectionist without a thorough faith in the vast importance and\r\ninherent nobility of Labor. On this as on all great questions Mr.\r\nChandler's convictions were radical, and he was right fundamentally.\r\nHe had been himself a laborer. The store, the farm, the factory, the\r\nwork-shop, are all one in this--their duties are labor. Mr. Chandler\r\nknew the worth of free labor. He had witnessed its seed-planting and\r\nwonderful fruitage of development in Michigan, and he honored the\r\nstrong, hardy, intelligent and self-reliant race who were the laborers\r\nthere, and of whom he was one. He had early opportunity to make this\r\nplain in the Senate. Hammond of South Carolina, a true representative\r\nof that turbulent, rebellious State and of the embodied insolence of\r\nits master class and of the man-owner's contempt for free labor, made\r\nat this time his notorious \"mud-sill\" speech. \"There must be laborers\r\nin every community, a low, degenerate class, who hew the wood and\r\ndraw the water, ... the mud-sills of society, in effect they are\r\nslaves;\" this was its idea. It was a frank avowal of the estimate put\r\nby the slaveholding oligarchy upon the Northern laborers, upon the men\r\nwho have made this country what it is. Mr. Chandler was then young\r\nin the Senate, and had spoken but rarely, but to this insult to his\r\nconstituency he was quick to reply. In his speech of March 12, 1858,\r\nthe first in which he addressed the Senate at any length, he said:\r\n\r\n  It is an attack upon my constituents. Under the Senator's version,\r\n  under his exposition of slavery, nine-tenths of the people of\r\n  the North are or have been at some time slaves; for nine-tenths\r\n  of the people of the North have at some time been hirelings and\r\n  laborers. We do not feel degraded by being laborers. We believe it\r\n  to be respectable.... Travel on any road in the State of Michigan,\r\n  and you will find flourishing farms on almost every 160 acres,\r\n  with comfortable dwellings, and a high state of improvement and\r\n  cultivation.... You will find the owners of these farms with four\r\n  or five sons of their neighboring farmers hired out by the day\r\n  or the month or the year.... These young men go to service or\r\n  labor until they get money enough to buy a farm; then they, too,\r\n  become the employers of labor.... These men are never degraded by\r\n  labor.... They are the foundations of society there. Some of these\r\n  men who are at work by the month during the summer on farms are in\r\n  the Legislature making laws for us in the winter.\r\n\r\nThere was more of it to the same effect--honest, indignant words in\r\ndefense of free Northern labor, and in eulogy of the men who toiled.\r\nAnd the tone of these portions of the speech was wholesomely defiant,\r\nwithout a shade of truckling to Southern insolence. Nine years later,\r\nin discussing proposed tariff amendments in 1867, Mr. Chandler said\r\nin the Senate, \"I thank God we are able to pay good prices to our\r\nlaborers.\" These utterances indicate the vein in which he always made\r\nhis voice heard and influence felt whenever the interests and rights of\r\nlabor were challenged either by speech or attempted legislation.\r\n\r\nThe tariff controversy in the United States dates back half a\r\ncentury. This republic in its colonial days was agricultural. There\r\nwere no mines nor manufactures. Each house did its own spinning and\r\nweaving. There were small shops for the making and repairing of a\r\nfew articles, and luxuries and fine goods for the rich were imported\r\nfrom the factories of Europe. The great labor-saving appliances of\r\nthe nineteenth century did not exist even in imagination. The water\r\npower of the country was unused and its boundless wealth of minerals\r\nunknown. The people were farmers or traders. For them the government\r\nwas founded, and apparently there was no contemplation of anything\r\nbeyond. It was years before a change came, but, once begun, it hurried\r\nwith rapid stride, until to-day more than one-twentieth of the entire\r\npopulation of the United States are engaged in manufacturing, as many\r\nmore are employed in occupations connected with and dependent upon such\r\nenterprises, and the capital invested in productive industries exceeds\r\nby millions of dollars the entire national debt.\r\n\r\nThese changes as they progressed made new demands upon the government.\r\nAfter the development of the steam engine, and after later inventions\r\nand contrivances had cheapened the production of cotton, woolen and\r\nother goods, household spinning-wheels and looms were silent, and\r\nthe United States imported nearly every manufactured article needed\r\nby its people, sending out in return the products of its farms and\r\nplantations, its tobacco, cotton and grain. Year after year this\r\ndraining process went on, the manufacturing towns of Europe growing\r\ngreat and prosperous, the United States widening and increasing in\r\npopulation, but adding little to its wealth. The mill-owners of\r\nEurope bought their cotton in South Carolina or Georgia, transported\r\nit across the Atlantic, made it into cloths, and returned them to\r\nNew York or Charleston. The American purchaser paid the cost of both\r\ntransportations, the cost and profit of manufacture abroad, all the\r\nprofits of middle-men who handled the goods, and all the cost of\r\nexchanges. By this process America toiled, while England and the other\r\nmanufacturing States of Europe reaped the harvest. Thoughtful people,\r\nknowing that capital employed in production feeds, clothes and lodges\r\nthe industrious workman, adds to the wealth of the nation, adds to its\r\nstrength, adds to its power of resistance, and lessens the individual\r\nburden of taxation, and comprehending the inevitable result of the\r\ndrain in progress, asked, Is there no way of preventing this? They\r\nsaw the raw material produced in bountiful profusion, saw the water\r\npower of the country running away to the sea unvexed by use, and\r\nnaturally asked, Is it not possible to bring the miners and smelters,\r\nthe founders, machinists and laborers, the mechanic and manufacturer\r\nof every description, here, to place them beside the raw material, to\r\nutilize this wasted power, and to save the losses and attrition that\r\nare impoverishing the country? When these thoughts took shape in the\r\nactive brains of Americans, the change began. Mills and factories\r\nsprang up by the water-courses. Tall chimneys, clouds of smoke and\r\nglowing furnaces came after. Thus American manufacturing was born.\r\n\r\nBut as the first mills and factories were established, these\r\ndiscoveries were made: In building a mill in England the laborers and\r\nmechanics could be hired at wages from twenty to forty per cent. lower\r\nthan prevailed on this continent. The cost of machinery, most of it\r\nbeing brought from Europe, was also greater. Foreign manufacturers\r\ncould hire their capital from the immense reservoir of Europe, where\r\nit had been accumulating for centuries, at from four to six per\r\ncent. interest. Here the borrower must pay eight or ten per cent. or\r\neven higher. There was another and even graver matter presented to\r\nthe consideration of the pioneer manufacturer. Labor in Europe was\r\ncheap--so cheap that, combined with abundant capital and low interest,\r\nit enabled the foreign manufacturer to pay two ocean transportations\r\nand yet undersell an American competitor at the very door of his own\r\nmill. Should the American mechanic be asked to toil for the pauper\r\nwages of Europe? Should it be the policy of this government to gather\r\nabout its factories the hungry-eyed, ill-clad, impoverished, ignorant\r\nand hopeless crowds which are found in the manufacturing towns of the\r\nold world? Could American institutions endure this? Where the people\r\nare all agriculturists, except under very extraordinary circumstances\r\nthey need never want for food, and such circumstances are rarely\r\nchargeable to misgovernment or to bad laws. The farming classes are\r\nwidely scattered; they are conservative and self-reliant, not given\r\nto mobs and outbreaks, nor to obeying the will of self-constituted\r\nleaders as do men gathered in great masses. But the men of mills\r\nand shops and factories, unless they are well paid, must suffer;\r\nand when they suffer their discontent threatens society itself.\r\nDespotic governments may apply the gag of a bayonet or the silence of\r\na musket ball, but this is not possible in a republic resting upon\r\nthe uncompelled support of all the people. Plainly, if a government,\r\nconstituted as is this, is to be preserved, the mechanics, the laborers\r\nin mills and mines, in shops and factories, must be paid enough to\r\nsupport themselves and their families in comfort, to educate their\r\nchildren and to permit the thrifty to make savings. If the time ever\r\ncomes when the millions of American workers upon whose assent this\r\ngovernment exists are reduced to the condition of the pauper labor\r\nof Europe, this republic and its golden promises of freedom will\r\nmost certainly ignobly perish from the face of the earth. From such\r\ncircumstances and ideas as these sprang the doctrine, accepted by\r\nalmost all of the earlier statesmen of the republic, that the revenue\r\nsystem of the United States must be so modeled as to stimulate domestic\r\nmanufactures, protect them from ruinous foreign competition, and\r\npromote that diversification of industry which is so essential to the\r\nprosperity and independence of free labor.\r\n\r\nThe first tariff measure (passed by the First Congress and approved by\r\nGeorge Washington) imposed but low duties, but in some of its details\r\npractically recognized the protective principle, and in its preamble\r\ndeclared one of its purposes to be \"the protection and encouragement\r\nof Domestic Manufacture.\" From 1807 to 1815 the United States was in a\r\ngreat degree driven from the ocean. A part of that time it was involved\r\nin a war with Great Britain, with an embargo laid upon its ports.\r\nDuring these years the home manufacturer had no foreign competition\r\nto fear, and factories sprang up to meet the local demands, drawing\r\nabout them laborers and their families, making a quick market for\r\nthe productions of the soil, and placing consumer and producer side\r\nby side. But this was the result of accident and not of deliberate\r\npolicy. The scene changed when the raising of the embargo brought into\r\nthe country a flood of manufactured articles representing cheap labor,\r\ncheap interest and cheap capital. Then came the demand for the levying\r\nof such duties on the products of foreign labor as would protect the\r\nAmerican manufacturer and enable him to pay a suitable compensation\r\nto the American workman. The first response to this was the tariff of\r\n1816, justly styled \"The Planters' and Farmers' Tariff,\" because it\r\ngave protection to coarser commodities which least required it, and\r\nwithheld it from those articles in whose production others were to\r\nbe used. Eight years afterward came a third tariff varying little in\r\nits general features, but with rates of duties slightly increased.\r\nFour years later (in 1828) was enacted the first thoroughly American\r\nprotective tariff, but it was soon destroyed by the act of July 12,\r\n1832 (the outcome of the Nullification controversy), which completely\r\nabolished its protective features. Within a few months, through the\r\nexertions of Mr. Clay, this measure was modified by what was known\r\nas the compromise tariff act, which continued in force until the\r\npassage of the protective tariff of 1842. This was in time displaced\r\nby the free-trade tariff, which went into force four years later, in\r\nJune, 1847. It was followed in 1861 (March 23) by the Morrill tariff,\r\na thoroughly protective measure, which with some modifications yet\r\nremains on the statute books.\r\n\r\nIn 1816, notwithstanding it had just emerged from war, the country's\r\nindustrial condition was at least hopeful, but the consequences of\r\nthe tariff of that year promptly manifested themselves. The American\r\nmanufacturer was undersold at the door of his mill by the foreigner;\r\nfactories closed, wages shrunk and the demand for labor diminished.\r\nPrices of all kinds of planter's and farmer's produce declined in\r\nturn, and to industrial prostration was speedily added agricultural\r\ndepression. Henry Clay pronounced the seven years preceding 1824 the\r\nmost disastrous this nation had ever known. But almost from the moment\r\nof its passage the country felt the impetus of the protective tariff of\r\n1828. Furnace doors were thrown open; foundries were built; the cobwebs\r\nthat had gathered about factory machinery disappeared in the whir of\r\nbusy wheels; labor came again into demand; immigration increased; the\r\nproducts of farms and plantations brought good prices; and the public\r\nrevenue grew until the national debt was extinguished. Prosperity thus\r\nbecame universal throughout the land. When this protective tariff of\r\n1828 gave way to the gradual reductions in duties of the compromise\r\nmeasure of 1832, there followed a repetition of the scenes that\r\nsucceeded the tariff of 1816. From 1837 to 1842 mills and furnaces were\r\nclosed, wages were reduced, laborers sought in vain for employment, the\r\npoor-houses were filled and manufacturers, farmers and planters became\r\nbankrupts together. Even the public treasury was unable to borrow at\r\nhome as small a sum as $1,000,000 at any rate of interest, and the\r\ngreat banking houses of Europe refused it credit, so that it was forced\r\nto the humiliation of selling its securities at ruinous discounts. The\r\npassage of the protective tariff of 1842 marks the date of another\r\nbusiness revival. Old mines were re-worked and new ones were opened.\r\nMill-fires were re-lighted and new mills sprang up in all directions.\r\nMoney became abundant, and public and private incomes exceeded all\r\nprecedent. Farmers and planters secured easy markets and ample prices\r\nfor their produce, and laborers' homes grew bright with plenty. Then\r\ncame the Free-Trade tariff of 1846 and the commercial decadence which\r\nculminated in the disasters of 1857. California and its gold delayed\r\nthe catastrophe but could not avert it. From the moment of the repeal\r\nof the protective tariff, the inflow of British iron and cloth began\r\nand the receding tide carried back American gold, impoverishing\r\nthe country. Industry was stricken to the earth, and day by day\r\nsaw the dependence of the United States on foreign markets growing\r\nuntil when the crash came it was complete. The vast flood of gold\r\nfrom California had gone into European vaults and in its stead could\r\nonly be shown receipts for foreign goods consumed and the wrecks of\r\nAmerican industries. The Morrill tariff was followed by an unparalleled\r\nmercantile and manufacturing development, which not even the disastrous\r\neffects of an inflated currency (in 1873-76) could more than briefly\r\ncheck.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler, who knew well these facts, and had learned \"the American\r\ndoctrine\" in the days of Clay, had taken his seat in the Senate when\r\nthe crash of 1857 came, and was active in demanding and shaping that\r\nrevolution in the revenue system which has made the United States one\r\nof the great manufacturing nations of the world. He was an ardent\r\nchampion of the Morrill tariff (of 1861), and aided materially in\r\nperfecting its details, watching with special vigilance those of\r\nits provisions which affected the vast interests of the Northwest.\r\nHe believed in the largest possible application of the protective\r\nprinciple, and favored aiding every American producer and every\r\nAmerican manufacturer who could complain on valid grounds of foreign\r\ncompetition. Every demand for protection, which gave reasonable promise\r\nof increasing the yield of any staple or of developing a new industry,\r\nreceived his energetic support. To any revenue measure or proposition,\r\nwhich seemed to him calculated to advance foreign at the expense of\r\nAmerican interests, he was uncompromisingly hostile. The abrogation of\r\nthe Reciprocity treaty with Canada he labored most assiduously to bring\r\nabout, and he resisted with all his characteristic pertinacity each\r\nsuccessive effort to restore a compact which imposed such heavy burdens\r\nupon the lumbermen, salt manufacturers, and farmers of the Northwest.\r\nThroughout his Senatorial term all measures affecting duties in\r\nany form or proposing any modification in their schedules found him\r\nalert, well-informed, and determined to maintain the protective policy\r\nagainst any assault.[12] Very much the greater, and undoubtedly the\r\nmost effective, part of his labors for an American tariff was put\r\nforth in committee-rooms and in the earnest use of argument and\r\ninfluence with fellow-Congressmen; he relied much more upon this work\r\nthan upon speech-making for results--and results he always ranked far\r\nabove display or mere publicity. Still he spoke not unfrequently on\r\ntariff questions, and a few quotations will illustrate satisfactorily\r\nhis positions and methods. This passage shows how radical was his\r\nprotectionism:\r\n\r\n  This nation to-day should be an exporter of iron instead of an\r\n  importer. There is no valid reason why we should buy one single\r\n  pound of iron from any other nation on the globe. Our mountains\r\n  are filled with the purest ores on the face of the earth.... If I\r\n  had my way I would absolutely prohibit the introduction of foreign\r\n  iron.\r\n\r\nThe context does not sustain an absolutely literal construction of the\r\nlast sentence. Mr. Chandler had seen Michigan when its copper mines\r\nwere unworked, its limitless riches of iron undiscovered, its salt\r\ndeposits unknown, and its pine forests unfelled. He had seen these\r\nindustries passing through various stages of prosperity and disaster\r\nas they were affected by prevailing tariffs, now shielded by a wise\r\npolicy of protection and now at the mercy of foreign producers, who at\r\ntimes (to use their own admission) \"voluntarily incur immense losses\r\nin order to destroy American competition and to gain and keep control\r\nof American markets.\" He saw these industries grow from nothing,\r\nuntil the annual yield of Michigan's copper mines became 20,266 tons,\r\nof its iron mines 1,125,231 tons, and of its salt wells 1,885,884\r\nbarrels, and until its lumber product expanded to the enormous total of\r\n2,700,000,000 feet in one season. They thus became powerful interests,\r\nemploying a great host of laborers and offering support to thousands\r\nof families. These facts and the tone of what Mr. Chandler said on\r\nkindred topics make it plain that by the absolute prohibition of the\r\nintroduction of foreign iron he meant not an embargo, but the affording\r\nof such ample protection to the iron industries of the entire country\r\nas would make it impossible for the products of foreign cheap labor to\r\ncompete in its markets with those of American labor, and as would make\r\nthe United States a seller and not a buyer of iron and its wares.\r\n\r\nWith all his earnestness as a protectionist, he kept the interests\r\nof labor predominant in his consideration of this subject. For\r\ninstance, in some remarks upon the lumber tariff, he said: \"It is\r\nperfectly well known that the great value of lumber is in the labor\r\nand the transportation, and while we in the United States are paying\r\nour laborers (in lumber) $2 a day, they are in the British Provinces\r\npaying but from 75 cents to $1 per day.\" And he steadily voted for\r\nsuch protection of the lumber trade as would enable producers engaged\r\nin that business to pay large wages, and opposed every suggestion\r\nwhich looked to impoverishing or pauperizing the American artisan. He\r\nuniformly upheld American industry and labor of every kind against\r\nthe competition of the world. He felt that the highest civilization\r\ncan only be secured through that policy of industrial diversification\r\nwhich brings consumer and producer side by side, and he favored giving\r\nit the widest possible scope. He frequently declared, \"I cannot vote\r\nto discriminate against any particular branch,\" and he firmly believed\r\nin protecting everything his country could produce. His vigilance in\r\ncaring for all interests and his grasp of the practical details of\r\ntariff legislation will appear from one or two brief citations from\r\nspeeches made in 1867 on proposed modifications of the Morrill tariff.\r\nThe duty on pig-metal was then $9 per ton, and it was proposed in the\r\nnew bill to admit scrap-iron on the payment of a duty of $3. On this\r\nproposition Mr. Chandler said:\r\n\r\n  The effect of this tariff will be to admit all the rails in the\r\n  world into the United States at a duty of $3 a ton. We will\r\n  become the recipients of all the scrap-iron in the world.... And\r\n  the effect will be to put out every blast furnace in the United\r\n  States, and stop the mining in every mountain in the country....\r\n  The expense of re-rolling bars is only about $30 a ton. You\r\n  admit scrap-iron at this nominal duty, and the result will be to\r\n  utterly destroy the revenue you now receive from iron--you will\r\n  import nothing but at the duty of $3 per ton. This scrap-iron is\r\n  worth two or three times as much as pig-metal. Pig-metal has to\r\n  be puddled once. It costs to-day $28 per ton to put pig-metal\r\n  into scrap, and yet you put a duty of $9 per ton on pig-metal\r\n  and propose a mere nominal duty of $3 per ton on scrap.... This\r\n  is absolutely abandoning the whole iron interests of the United\r\n  States, save and excepting the rolling-mills.... The State of\r\n  Pennsylvania takes about 300,000 tons of Lake Superior ore to mix\r\n  with her inferior ore, and transports it by water 700 or 800 miles,\r\n  and afterward by land carriage--a very expensive carriage--from\r\n  50 to 300 miles. This ore is mixed with the Pennsylvania ores,\r\n  and transported then a long distance at very great expense. The\r\n  demand for pig-iron is for rolling.... Calling material nothing,\r\n  it costs the manufacturers $60 per ton of scrap-iron to take the\r\n  ore and the coal from the mine and deliver at the works, every\r\n  cent of which is labor.... There are in the world 100,000 miles of\r\n  railroads, of which 36,000 are in the United States, and 64,000 in\r\n  the rest of the world. These railroads are laid, on an average,\r\n  with rails weighing 56 pounds to the yard, and use 49,000 tons\r\n  net to the mile. This gives the 64,000 miles abroad 3,136,000\r\n  tons of iron. This has to be re-rolled on an average once in ten\r\n  years; consequently one-tenth of this amount is let loose upon some\r\n  country every year in the shape of scrap-iron. That would make the\r\n  amount of railroad scrap alone 313,600 tons per annum, which it is\r\n  proposed to admit at a duty of $3 a ton, and which it costs to-day\r\n  $60 a ton to put in the form of scrap in the United States. This\r\n  is Free Trade in the broadest sense. It is worse than that.... It\r\n  will build up rolling-mills, but it will break down every forge\r\n  in the United States.... It will stop our mines in Michigan that\r\n  yield ores richer than any other in the world.... It will make this\r\n  country the _entrepôt_ for the scrap-iron of the world.\r\n\r\nHe would not build up the rolling-mill at the expense of the mine and\r\nthe blast-furnace. He would not build up one industry upon the ruins of\r\nany other. His many speeches and his more numerous votes in the Senate\r\nall indicated the same clear purpose to avoid discrimination against\r\nhome interests where possible, and to protect everything American\r\nagainst everything of foreign production.\r\n\r\nOne phase of this many-sided question which made a deep impression upon\r\nMr. Chandler remains to be mentioned. In common with all thoughtful\r\nAmericans, during the course of the rebellion he realized the priceless\r\nvalue of the large-brained, energetic and highly-skilled American\r\nmechanic. He had marked these men in every brigade, upon every field of\r\nthe war, enabling commanders to overcome obstacles which without them\r\nwould have been insurmountable. He had seen mills and factories and\r\nshops pouring into the storehouses of the government the multitudinous\r\narticles without which a successful prosecution of the war would\r\nhave been impossible, and that, too, with a rapidity which was as\r\namazing as it was unexampled. He was from his early manhood a strong\r\nprotectionist. But when he realized what the American working-men had\r\ndone for the country and for freedom, and how its protected trades had\r\nserved the government in its hour of trial, he was still more confirmed\r\nin the wisdom of the system which fosters American industry and secures\r\nto the country the priceless heritage of prosperous and intelligent\r\nlaborers and mechanics.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] The following letter is written by a gentleman thoroughly familiar\r\nwith the history of tariff legislation at Washington for many years:\r\n\r\n                                        WASHINGTON, D. C., Jan. 5, 1880.\r\n\r\nSome eight years ago, when a serious reduction in the copper tariff was\r\nproposed, I know that Mr. Chandler rendered valuable aid in bringing\r\nthe facts before the Senate in his clear, terse way--going straight\r\nto the mark. Then, as always in practical matters, his prompt manner,\r\nhis business knowledge, and his immense power of will made him the man\r\nto be called on, and he ever responded to the call, and had a power\r\nwonderful indeed to \"push things.\" When the act to reduce internal\r\nrevenue taxes--which had passed the House almost unanimously, and had\r\nbeen perfected by the mutual labors of Congressional committees and\r\nrepresentative business men--was before the Senate for final action in\r\nMarch, 1868, an effort was made by Senator Fessenden, of Maine, to add\r\nto it as a \"rider\" a clause affecting the copper tariff, which would\r\nsurely have delayed if not defeated the measure. Senator Chandler spoke\r\nten minutes, putting concentrated power in his words, and showing the\r\ngreat importance of passing the act and the needless mischief that must\r\ncome of saddling it with another question. He succeeded in defeating\r\nthe Fessenden amendment, the act passed without it, and it reduced the\r\nannual burden of internal revenue taxation some $60,000,000 (all this\r\ninternal).\r\n\r\nThe Senator's views on tariff legislation were broad and comprehensive,\r\nrecognizing the interdependence of all branches of industry and the\r\nimportance of such action as should bear with equal justice on all:\r\nknowing no East, nor West, nor South--no petty and narrow jealousy\r\nbetween farmer and merchant and manufacturer--but seeking the wise care\r\nand healthy growth o£ a varied home industry all over the land.\r\n\r\nOn these subjects he showed practical sagacity and the same moral\r\ncourage and bold vigor that marked his great efforts for freedom and\r\njustice to all in the last and grandest year, which so nobly closed\r\na public career which will live and grow in the minds of future\r\ngenerations. Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                                      GILES B. STEBBINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nSERVICES TO NORTHWESTERN COMMERCIAL INTERESTS AND THE CAUSE OF INTERNAL\r\nIMPROVEMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon the day following that on which Mr. Chandler first took his seat\r\nin the Senate Judah P. Benjamin of Louisiana offered a resolution, from\r\na special committee in regard to the formation of committees, amending\r\nthe thirty-fourth rule of the Senate by providing that thereafter the\r\nstanding committees of that body (their members are selected by the\r\nSenate itself and not by its presiding officer) should be appointed\r\nat the commencement of each session of Congress. The Committee on\r\nCommerce then, and from that time until the special session in the\r\nspring of 1875, consisted of seven members. Mr. Benjamin's resolution\r\nwas adopted, and on March 9th the standing committees for the special\r\nsession were, on motion of Mr. Seward of New York, announced. The\r\nCommittee on Commerce was composed of Messrs. Clay of Alabama,\r\nchairman, Benjamin of Louisiana, Bigler of Pennsylvania, Toombs of\r\nGeorgia, Reid of North Carolina, Bright of Indiana, and Hamlin of\r\nMaine. Mr. Chandler was assigned to the Committee on the District of\r\nColumbia, of which Mr. Brown of Mississippi was chairman. Mr. Hamlin\r\nof Maine was also appointed on this inferior committee, giving it two\r\nRepublican members, while the Committee on Commerce had but one. The\r\ngeneral assignment of places to the minority was so inadequate and\r\nunfair that a Republican caucus (the first Mr. Chandler attended)\r\nhad been called to consider the matter. Mr. Chandler, although a new\r\nmember, was one of its speakers and gave strong expression to his\r\nsense of the injustice with which both his party and the Northwest\r\nhad been treated. It was decided to make a formal protest against the\r\nconstitution of the committees, and, as a result of this consultation,\r\nwhen Mr. Seward's motion was made, Mr. Fessenden of Maine, as the\r\nspokesman of the Republicans, denounced the unfairness of the majority\r\nwith force and vigor. In his remarks he said \"that there was not an\r\nindividual member of the Republican party in the Senate who deemed\r\nthat a just and fair division had been made in the appointment of the\r\ncommittees, especially two or three of them.\" He also declared that\r\nthere was not a just and fair division with reference to questions\r\ncoming before the committees, and then gave this illustration: \"Take,\r\nfor instance, the Committee on Commerce. On that committee the\r\nRepublican party, numbering twenty out of the sixty-one members of the\r\nSenate, is assigned, of the whole number of seven, one member.... The\r\ninterests of the whole lake region, the interests of New England and of\r\nNew York, involving, as those large portions of the country do, such\r\nan infinite superiority of all its commerce, are found with only two\r\nmembers out of the seven.\" Mr. Hamlin here corrected Mr. Fessenden's\r\nstatement, by saying, \"My colleague is mistaken.... The interests of\r\nwhich he speaks have only _one_ member on that committee, not two.\" Mr.\r\nHamlin was right; there was but one member of the Committee on Commerce\r\nto represent the immense interests of the country of the Great Lakes of\r\nthe Northwest and of the whole of New England and New York, and that\r\nsingle member was himself. But the Republican protest, well-grounded as\r\nit was, proved then unavailing.\r\n\r\nAt the first regular session of the Thirty-fifth Congress, beginning\r\nin December, 1857, Mr. Allen, of Rhode Island, presented under the\r\nrule a new list of the standing committees of the Senate for adoption.\r\nThat on Commerce was only changed by the substitution of Mr. Allen\r\nfor Mr. Bright of Indiana, increasing its New England but diminishing\r\nits Western membership. Messrs. Hamlin, Chandler and Wilson again made\r\nvigorous remonstrances against the unjust formation of the standing\r\ncommittees as a whole. This was Mr. Chandler's first speech in the\r\nSenate, and it was as follows:\r\n\r\n  I find in the \"Globe\" of yesterday the following announcement: \"The\r\n  caucus of all parties in the Senate has agreed to constitute the\r\n  committees as follows.\" And then follows a list in detail. This\r\n  announcement, as I understand it, is incorrect. I believe that no\r\n  such caucus has been held. I am informed that a Democratic caucus\r\n  was held, and the committees made up, leaving certain blanks to be\r\n  submitted to the Republicans for them to fill. They saw fit to fill\r\n  these blanks, under protest. No such caucus as is announced in the\r\n  statement which I have read was ever held. No assent has ever been\r\n  given by the Republicans of this Senate to any such formation of\r\n  committees as is there announced.\r\n\r\n  I rise, sir, to protest against this list of committees as\r\n  presented here. Never before, in the whole course of my\r\n  observation, have I seen a large minority virtually ignored in a\r\n  legislative body upon important committees. This is the first time\r\n  that I have ever witnessed such a total, or almost total, ignoring\r\n  of a large and influential minority. But, sir, whom and what does\r\n  this minority represent? It represents--I believe I am correct in\r\n  saying--more than half--certainly nearly one-half--of all the free\r\n  white inhabitants of these United States; it represents two-thirds\r\n  of all the commerce of the United States; and more than two-thirds\r\n  of the revenues of the United States; and yet this minority,\r\n  representing the commerce and revenues of the nation, is expected\r\n  to be satisfied with one place upon the tail end of a committee of\r\n  seven on Commerce. I may almost say that that committee is of more\r\n  importance to the Northwest than all the other committees of this\r\n  body, but the great Northwest is totally ignored upon a committee\r\n  in which it takes so deep an interest. Not a solitary member of\r\n  this body from that portion of the country is honored with a\r\n  position on that committee, and yet you have been told of the\r\n  hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of commerce which is there\r\n  looking for protection to this body.\r\n\r\n  Sir, we are not satisfied, and we desire to enter our protest\r\n  against any such formation of committees as is here presented. But\r\n  we would say to the gentlemen on the other side of the chamber; You\r\n  have the power to-day; you can elect your committees as you see\r\n  fit; you can give us one representative on a committee of five, or\r\n  one on a committee of seven, or none on any of the committees, if\r\n  you think proper. Exercise that power in your own discretion; but,\r\n  gentlemen, beware! for the time is not far distant when the measure\r\n  you mete out to us to-day shall be meted to you again.\r\n\r\nSenators Pugh, Bayard, Gwin and Brown, from the Democratic side,\r\ndefended the list as presented by Mr. Allen, and his resolution for its\r\nappointment was adopted by a strict party vote of thirty to nineteen.\r\nThe Republican protests were again unheeded by the Senate, but in less\r\nthan four years Mr. Chandler's prediction, that the situation would be\r\nreversed, was fulfilled.\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Chandler entered the Senate there had been some work done\r\nby the United States upon the most serious natural obstacle to the\r\nnavigation of the Great Lakes, the tortuous channels and extensive\r\nshoals at the mouth of the St. Clair river, known as the \"St. Clair\r\nFlats.\" Largely through Senator Cass's efforts an appropriation of\r\n$45,000 had been made in the Thirty-fourth Congress (it was passed over\r\nFranklin Pierce's veto) for this work, and this sum had been expended\r\nunder the supervision of Major Whipple in the clearing out of a channel\r\nthrough the shoals of about 6,000 feet in length, 150 feet in width,\r\nand nine feet in depth at low water. This improvement, valuable as it\r\nwas, did not prove at all adequate, and was made much less useful in\r\nthe few following years by a lessening in the depth of the water of\r\nLake St. Clair. The rapidly-growing commerce of the lakes manifestly\r\ndemanded the early construction and permanent maintenance through these\r\nshoals of a first-class ship canal, which could be safely used in all\r\nconditions of water and weather by vessels of the largest class. Mr.\r\nChandler clearly perceived the necessity for this important national\r\nwork, determined to rest not until its completion, and commenced\r\nat once his attack on the great obstacles in its way--namely, the\r\ndisposition of the older States to undervalue the commercial importance\r\nof the Northwest, and the traditional hostility of the Democracy to\r\nall internal improvements. The first measure, which (on January 14,\r\n1858) Mr. Chandler gave notice of his intention to introduce, was a\r\nbill \"making an additional appropriation for deepening the channel of\r\nthe St. Clair Flats;\" when introduced it was referred to the Committee\r\non Commerce. There an effort was made to strangle it by persistent\r\ninaction. Accordingly, on April 24, Mr. Chandler introduced in the\r\nSenate a resolution instructing the Committee on Commerce to report\r\nback this bill for action by the Senate. This resolution not receiving\r\nimmediate consideration, on May 3 he called it up and demanded a vote.\r\nMr. Clay, the chairman of the committee, opposed it with much temper,\r\nand moved to lay it on the table, but this motion was lost by one vote.\r\nMr. Clay then attacked Mr. Chandler's resolution as insulting to the\r\nCommittee on Commerce, and said he spurned the idea that the committee\r\ncould be instructed to report in favor of a certain appropriation for\r\na certain work, and that he should despise himself if he was capable\r\nof obeying such instructions. Mr. Hamlin, the sole Republican member,\r\nexpressed his gratification at the fact that the Senator from Michigan\r\n(Mr. Chandler) had offered this resolution; he thought that it was\r\nappropriate, and that the action of the committee called for such\r\ninstructions. Mr. Clay having inquired, \"What is the use of having a\r\nCabinet or an engineer corps, if the Senate is to take these matters\r\ninto its own hands?\" Mr. Hamlin replied, \"What is the use of a Senate,\r\nif the Committee on Commerce, or the Cabinet officers, or the engineer\r\ncorps, are to control these matters?\" and insisted that the Committee\r\non Commerce was a creature of the Senate, within its control, and that\r\nif it differed from the Senate in regard to any proposition before\r\nit, that body had the right to instruct the committee what action\r\nto take. He added that because the committee had agreed to make no\r\nappropriation excepting for certain specific matters, it did not follow\r\nthat the Senate must adopt its views, and be controlled thereby;\r\nthat the servant had no right nor authority to bind the master, and\r\nthat the committee was the servant of the Senate. Mr. Clay finally\r\nyielded the point that the Senate had the right to order a committee\r\nto report back the bill, but still objected to the proposition to\r\nhave it instructed to specify a certain amount to be appropriated, and\r\nMr. Chandler consented to modify his resolution so as to instruct the\r\ncommittee to report back the bill for the action of the Senate without\r\nrecommendation as to the amount of the appropriation. Mr. Benjamin,\r\nat this point, moved, as a substitute for the pending resolution, a\r\ngeneral order to the committee to report on all public works upon\r\nwhich there had been any expenditure, and this motion prevailed. Mr.\r\nChandler, who was after a specific point and not a mere generality,\r\naccepted this as a defeat, and began anew by giving notice on the spot\r\nthat he should ask leave at a subsequent day to introduce a bill for\r\nthe improvement of the St. Clair Flats, making an appropriation of\r\n$55,000, this being the amount estimated by the United States engineers\r\nas necessary at that time. On May 10 he presented this bill, but the\r\nSenate refused to refer it, and adopted a motion to lay it upon the\r\ntable. Mr. Chandler met this second defeat without discouragement,\r\nand later in the session did succeed after two efforts in procuring\r\nthe addition of this item of $55,000 to the civil appropriation bill.\r\nBut the threat of an executive veto of the whole measure, if this\r\nappropriation was not omitted, proved potent with the Senate, and it\r\nwas ultimately stricken out. Mr. Chandler closed his last speech on\r\nthis measure at that session, with a demand for a vote by yeas and\r\nnays, and these words:\r\n\r\n  I want to see who is friendly to the great Northwest, and who is\r\n  not--for we are about making our last prayer here. The time is\r\n  not far distant when, instead of coming here and begging for our\r\n  rights, we shall extend our hands and _take_ the blessing. After\r\n  1860 we shall not be here as beggars.\r\n\r\nOf this resolute struggle of his first Congressional session, Mr.\r\nChandler said in an address at St. Johns, in Michigan, on Oct. 17, 1858:\r\n\r\n  When I took my seat in the Senate I supposed every section of\r\n  the country would be fairly heard in the details of business.\r\n  There were twenty Republican Senators representing two-thirds\r\n  the revenue, business and wealth of the country. How were they\r\n  placed on committees? Out of seven in the Committee on Commerce\r\n  they had one. I call attention to this fact. It bears the mark\r\n  of design. How does this work?... I introduced at an early day a\r\n  bill appropriating money for the St. Clair Flats, and it went to\r\n  this Southern Committee on Commerce. I procured all the necessary\r\n  maps and plans and estimates, and gave them into their charge.\r\n  One hundred days rolled away and they had not deigned to examine\r\n  them. I then introduced a resolution instructing them to report.\r\n  Subsequently I introduced a bill myself which was laid on the\r\n  table. By the most untiring efforts I succeeded in getting the\r\n  desired appropriation tacked upon an appropriation bill and passed.\r\n  But the President's friends threatened a veto of the whole bill\r\n  unless this was stricken out--and that was done. Thus committees\r\n  were packed against us and we were thwarted at every turn.\r\n  Thousands of dollars can be obtained for almost any creek in the\r\n  South, while the inland seas of the North are denied a dollar, and\r\n  we are left to take care of ourselves the best we can.\r\n\r\nThe second session of the Thirty-fifth Congress began in December,\r\n1858, and on the 21st of that month Mr. Chandler moved to take his St.\r\nClair Flats bill from the table. This time it was passed by a vote\r\nof 29 to 22, and sent to the House where it encountered a vigorous\r\nopposition but was finally passed, its introducer working for it\r\nwith the utmost energy in the committee-rooms, on the floor, and by\r\nprivate solicitation. It reached Mr. Buchanan in the last days of that\r\nCongress, and he killed it by withholding his signature but without\r\na formal veto. The Thirty-sixth Congress met in December, 1859, and\r\non the 4th of January Mr. Chandler's bill to deepen the St. Clair\r\nFlats channel made its appearance. On February 2 Mr. Buchanan informed\r\nCongress, in a special message, of his reasons for \"pocketing\" the\r\nmeasure at the last session. This veto took the position that the\r\nimprovement of harbors and the deepening of the channels of rivers\r\nshould be done by the respective States, and suggested that Michigan\r\nin conjunction with Upper Canada should provide the necessary means to\r\ncarry out the contemplated improvements in the channels of commerce\r\nbetween those two countries, whereas the plain fact was that the\r\ninterest of that State in such works was a mere tithe of that of\r\nthe whole Northwest. Mr. Chandler reviewed this message at length\r\nin the Senate on February 6, exposing Mr. Buchanan's misstatements\r\nin detail, and denouncing the Democratic construction of the\r\nconstitution. Jefferson Davis at once came to the defense of the veto\r\non constitutional grounds, and a running debate followed on the subject\r\nbetween Messrs. Chandler and Bingham of Michigan, Hamlin, Crittenden,\r\nDavis, Toombs, Wigfall and others. Mr. Crittenden condemned the veto,\r\nwhile Toombs and Wigfall joined Davis in its defense. Thus the plotters\r\nof rebellion assumed a hypocritical attitude as defenders of the\r\nconstitution. Their treasonable daggers were yet concealed beneath\r\ntheir Senatorial togas, as they stood in their high places and assumed\r\na virtue that they never had, that of being patriots with a deep regard\r\nfor the fundamental law of the land. No action followed this debate,\r\nbut on February 20 Mr. Chandler moved that his bill be made the special\r\norder for the 23d. This motion prevailed, but when that day arrived\r\nthe Senate refused to proceed with its consideration, Mr. Chandler\r\nprotesting against this delay in a speech pointing out the necessity\r\nfor prompt action. On March 13 he moved to take the bill from the table\r\nbut the Senate refused. Six days later he renewed the motion with the\r\nsame result. Eleven days after that he did succeed in getting the\r\nmeasure made the special order for April 10, but again other business\r\ndisplaced it, and so no action was taken before adjournment. The second\r\nsession of this Congress commenced in December, 1861, with civil war\r\nimminent and no chance for the consideration of any project of internal\r\nimprovement. At the meeting of the next Congress the Democracy found\r\nitself in a petty minority, and remained powerless at Washington for\r\nmany years. As soon as it became plain that rebellion could not destroy\r\nthe life of the nation, Mr. Chandler brought forward again his bill for\r\nthe improvement of the channels at the head of Lake St. Clair, and with\r\nthe powerful support of his colleagues and the commercial interests of\r\nthe Northwest obtained without difficulty from Republican Congresses\r\nsuch appropriations as were required for the prompt construction of a\r\ngreat ship-canal, ranking to-day among the most important and useful\r\nof the public works of this continent. Its history and statistics are\r\ngiven in this extract from an official report for the year ending June\r\n30, 1879:\r\n\r\n  This canal (according to its present plan) was projected by Col.\r\n  T. J. Cram, of the Corps of Engineers, in August, 1866, as the\r\n  best method of improving navigation at the mouth of the St. Clair\r\n  river. He proposed opening the lower tortuous reach of the south\r\n  channel, and making a direct cut from its mouth proper to deep\r\n  water in Lake St. Clair. His project was approved, and construction\r\n  began on the 20th of August, 1867, under contract with Mr. John\r\n  Brown of Thorold, Canada. The original plan was a straight canal\r\n  300 feet wide in the clear, and 13 feet deep at low stage of water,\r\n  protected by dykes 5 feet in height and 58 feet wide on top, built\r\n  of the material dredged from the channel and thrown behind a pile\r\n  and timber revetment. The canal was completed in the autumn of\r\n  1871, and turned over to the charge of Maj. O. M. Poe, Corps of\r\n  Engineers, on the 11th of December. As completed, the banks are\r\n  7,221 feet in length, and constructed mostly of dredged sand thrown\r\n  behind a revetment consisting of piling in two rows driven 13 feet\r\n  apart and parallel, and capped with a timber superstructure 5\r\n  feet high, the front row being supplemented with a single row of\r\n  sheath-piling to prevent the sand bank from washing back into the\r\n  canal. As originally planned, the reverse faces of the embankment\r\n  were to be permitted to take their natural slope, but as it was\r\n  found that the banks if left so would be gradually washed away,\r\n  they were secured eventually by a pile and plank revetment. The\r\n  timbers in the superstructure were carbolized to prevent rotting,\r\n  but the process proved a disastrous failure, owing to its imperfect\r\n  application, and the timbers thus treated are as a general rule\r\n  at this date a mere shell with a core of dry rot. The banks were\r\n  planted with willows and sodded in some places. The history of\r\n  the work since Major Poe took charge, excepting as regards the\r\n  deepening of the channel for 200 feet of its width to a depth of 16\r\n  feet, as projected by that officer, has been a monotonous routine\r\n  of stopping leaks on the canal face, due to the imperfection of the\r\n  single row of sheath-piling, which permits the sand to be sucked\r\n  through by passing vessels, and propeller-wheels working near the\r\n  revetment. These leaks have been stopped from time to time at\r\n  various points by various devices, such as marsh sod, etc.... The\r\n  deepening of the canal was begun under Major Poe's direction by\r\n  contract with Mr. John Brown of Thorold, Canada, in June, 1873, and\r\n  finished September 23, 1878, under the direction of Major Weitzel,\r\n  who had in the meanwhile relieved Major Poe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SHIP-CANAL AT THE ST. CLAIR FLATS.]\r\n\r\n  Up to the time when the canal was turned over as completed to Major\r\n  Poe, it cost in construction and repair $472,837.84. There was\r\n  subsequently expended by Majors Poe and Weitzel $101,533.63, partly\r\n  in repairs, but mainly in deepening the canal; and afterward,\r\n  up to the close of the present fiscal year, $19,162.78 were\r\n  expended in repairs and protection. It will thus be seen that the\r\n  canal has thus far cost $586,111.56 in construction, improvement\r\n  and repair.... Colonel Cram's original estimate of the cost of\r\n  this work was $428,754. The whole amount appropriated has been\r\n  $590,000. The annual cost of maintenance is $5,000. There are two\r\n  light-houses on the banks.\r\n\r\nThe value of the commerce which annually passes between the willow-clad\r\npiers of the canal is estimated by hundreds of millions, and in every\r\nseason its cost has been more than made good by the disasters and\r\ndelays it has averted. Mr. Chandler regarded his efforts to secure its\r\nconstruction as the hardest fight of his Congressional service, and\r\nthere is nothing in his public life more thoroughly characteristic\r\nof the man than the skill, energy, and persistence with which he\r\nchampioned this measure in the face of the strongest obstacles, and\r\nin spite of repeated defeats, session after session and Congress\r\nafter Congress, until entire success crowned his labors. Many others\r\nco-operated with him and aided in securing the ultimate victory; but\r\ncircumstances and his indomitable will placed him at the front in the\r\ndecisive struggle, and this great public work is an enduring monument\r\nof the value of his services to the vast commercial interests of the\r\nNorthwest.\r\n\r\nAt the second session of the Thirty-fifth Congress the earnest protests\r\nof the year before bore fruit, and the Committee on Commerce then\r\nappointed was composed of Senators Clay of Alabama, chairman, Bigler\r\nof Pennsylvania, Toombs of Georgia, Reid of North Carolina, Allen\r\nof Rhode Island, Hamlin of Maine, and Chandler of Michigan. This\r\ncommenced Mr. Chandler's connection with that committee; he remained a\r\nmember of it throughout all his Senatorial terms, and was its chairman\r\nand inspiring spirit during the years of its greatest activity and\r\nusefulness. It is one of the most important standing committees of the\r\nSenate of the United States, and during Mr. Chandler's chairmanship\r\nits labors were gradually increased, partly through the growing\r\nbusiness and commerce of the country, and partly by having new topics\r\nassigned for its consideration and action, because of the prompt\r\nattention and rigid scrutiny given to all matters coming under the\r\nsupervision of Mr. Chandler as its head. To this committee are referred\r\nunder the rules nominations of collectors of customs, appraisers\r\nof merchandise, surveyors of customs, of officers appointed to or\r\npromoted in the revenue marine service, of the chief officers in the\r\nlife-saving service, and of all incumbents of consular positions. It\r\nalso considers bills fixing the compensation of such officers; bills\r\nrelating to marine hospitals and the customs, consular and life-saving\r\nservices; bills concerning the interests of the commercial marine of\r\nthe country, including the registry, enrollment and license of vessels,\r\ntheir inspection and measurement, tonnage-tax, entrance and clearance\r\nfees, names and official numbers, the lights to be carried, the\r\nsteam pressure allowed, the providing of small boats and life-saving\r\napparatus on passenger steamers, and restrictions upon the number of\r\npassengers or kind of freight; and bills granting medals for heroic\r\nservice in saving life in case of shipwreck or similar disaster. To it\r\nare referred all measures for the improvement of rivers and harbors\r\nin the interests of commerce; for the construction of breakwaters,\r\nharbors of refuge, ship-canals, and locks for slack-water navigation;\r\nfor the building of bridges across navigable rivers, or other waters of\r\nthe United States; for the establishment of ports of entry and ports\r\nof delivery; for the establishment of customs collection districts\r\nor changing the boundaries thereof; granting American registers to\r\nforeign vessels (usually passed where a wreck of a foreign vessel has\r\nbeen purchased and rebuilt by an American citizen); and relating to\r\nthe duties and districts of supervising and subordinate inspectors\r\nof steam craft. There is hardly any conceivable question relating to\r\nvessels of the United States that Congress has not power to act upon,\r\nand such matters, unless pertaining to the naval service, are always\r\nreferred to the respective committees on commerce of the Senate and\r\nHouse, Congress as a rule following their recommendations where no\r\npolitical question is involved. In addition to an immense mass of\r\nmeasures coming under the classes enumerated, the Senate Committee on\r\nCommerce, during Mr. Chandler's connection with it, considered and\r\nreported bills to admit ship-building material free of duty, to prevent\r\nthe extermination of the fur-bearing seals of Alaska, authorizing the\r\nappointment of shipping commissioners, and defining a gross of matches.\r\nAll these facts are recited to show the great variety of questions that\r\nare referred to the Senate Committee on Commerce--greater than are sent\r\nto any other Congressional committee.\r\n\r\nNo particular changes took place in the _personnel_ of this committee\r\nas already given until in the last year of Buchanan's administration.\r\nAt the closing session of the Thirty-sixth Congress it consisted of\r\nC. C. Clay, chairman, Bigler, Toombs, Clingman, Saulsbury, Hamlin,\r\nand Chandler. Senator Hamlin having been elected Vice-President,\r\nresigned (in January, 1861) his Senatorship, and Mr. Baker of Oregon\r\nwas appointed to fill the vacancy thus caused on this committee. In the\r\nmiddle of January Mr. Clay resigned to join the rebellion, and A. 0. P.\r\nNicholson of Tennessee was made a member of the committee in his place.\r\nOn the 24th of January, 1861, by the unanimous consent of the Senate,\r\nthe Vice-President filled all the vacancies on the standing committees\r\ncaused by the retiring of the Southern Senators, and the Committee\r\non Commerce then, as re-constituted, consisted of Senators Bigler,\r\nchairman, Clingman, Saulsbury, Chandler, Baker, and Nicholson.\r\n\r\nAt the special session of the Thirty-seventh Congress (in March,\r\n1861) the Senate committees were radically reorganized, and the\r\nnew Committee on Commerce, the first appointed by the Republican\r\nparty, consisted of Zachariah Chandler, chairman, Preston King, Lot\r\nM. Morrill, Henry Wilson, Thomas L. Clingman, Willard Saulsbury, and\r\nAndrew Johnson. Mr. Chandler continued in the chairmanship until he\r\nceased to be a member of the Senate in 1875. Mr. Clingman soon joined\r\nthe rebels, and his place on the committee was filled by Mr. Ten\r\nEyck of New Jersey. From session to session changes were made in its\r\nmembership, and among the names on its rolls during the fourteen years\r\nthat Mr. Chandler sat at the head of its table were Edwin D. Morgan,\r\nJames H. Lane, Solomon Foot, Timothy O. Howe, James W. Nesmith, Justin\r\nS. Morrill, John A. J. Creswell, George F. Edmunds, James R. Doolittle,\r\nWilliam P. Kellogg, George E. Spencer, Roscoe Conkling, William A.\r\nBuckingham, J. R. West, John H. Mitchell, John B. Gordon, George R.\r\nDennis, and George S. Boutwell. Mr. Chandler was succeeded in the\r\nchairmanship when he left the Senate by Roscoe Conkling of New York;\r\nsoon after he was re-elected in 1879 the Democrats regained control,\r\nand the Committee on Commerce of the Forty-sixth Senate was organized\r\nby them. Mr. Chandler was made a member of it, and at the time of his\r\ndeath it consisted of Senator Gordon of Georgia, chairman, Ransom of\r\nNorth Carolina, Randolph of New Jersey, Hereford of West Virginia, Coke\r\nof Texas, Conkling of New York, McMillan of Minnesota, Jones of Nevada,\r\nand Chandler of Michigan.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler's business principles were carried out in his committee\r\nwork as thoroughly as they had been in his mercantile career. He\r\nbelieved that what was worth doing at all was worth doing well. It was\r\nthe custom of the Senate Committee on Commerce to assemble formally\r\nonce a week, for the consideration of such petitions and bills as had\r\nbeen referred to it for action. Whenever the appointed hour for meeting\r\narrived Mr. Chandler was always in his seat, while its other members\r\nbut rarely displayed anything like his promptitude. It annoyed the\r\nchairman to have any one late, and it was his custom to proceed with\r\nbusiness as soon as a quorum was present, or if no quorum appeared\r\nwithin fifteen or twenty minutes, to assume that there was one and\r\ncommence work; no protests against this course were ever made by\r\nthe tardy or absent members. The location of the room of the Senate\r\nCommittee on Commerce during Mr. Chandler's whole term of Senatorial\r\nservice was in the northwest corner of the capitol, on the floor\r\nleading to the galleries. Its windows look down upon the city of\r\nWashington, with the broad, historic Potomac and the forest-crowned\r\nVirginia hills the distance, and the sunset view from them--including\r\nthe blue glimmering river, the golden gossamer clouds, the green\r\nfoliage upon the brow of the hills in the extreme horizon--could never\r\nbe excelled in an artist's most vivid conception.\r\n\r\nThe first bill reported by Mr. Chandler as chairman of the Committee on\r\nCommerce was one to provide for the collection of duties on imports and\r\nfor other purposes. He brought it in five days after the appointment\r\nof the committee at the first session of the Thirty-seventh Congress,\r\nand asked that it should be put upon its passage at once. A single\r\nobjection carried it over under the rules until the next day, when it\r\nwas passed by a vote of 36 to 6. The scope of the bill was extensive.\r\nIt provided for confiscating to the United States all vessels belonging\r\nto rebels, for closing ports of entry in rebellious States, and for\r\nthe employment of additional revenue cutters. It also authorized the\r\nPresident under certain circumstances to declare by proclamation\r\nStates, sections, or parts of States, in insurrection against the\r\nUnited States, and prohibited all commercial intercourse between such\r\ninsurrectionary States, or parts of States, and the rest of the Union\r\nso long as the insurrection should continue. It was thus among the\r\nearliest and most important of the war measures.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to occupy space with the details[13] of the\r\nenormous mass of business transacted by the Senate Committee on\r\nCommerce during Mr. Chandler's chairmanship. It was in those years\r\nthat the sentiment of every section, in favor of extending the\r\nfostering care of the government to the aid of internal commerce,\r\nwas consolidated and organized until it bore down all opposition and\r\ncompletely reversed the general policy and practice of the United\r\nStates. How important and complete this revolution was will appear\r\nfrom the table of the appropriations for river, harbor and kindred\r\nimprovements made at successive Congressional sessions since the\r\nfoundation of the republic.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler was the firm friend of an intelligently-planned and\r\ngeneral system of internal improvements. His labors, and those of men\r\nlike him, have borne fruit in manifold aids to commerce scattered over\r\nriver, lake and ocean--light-houses, breakwaters, harbors of refuge,\r\nstraightened and deepened channels, ship-canals and improved natural\r\nhighways. He was prompt to recognize the claims of all sections, but\r\nwas especially vigilant in regard to the necessities of the Northwest,\r\nand his memory will long be cherished throughout the region of the\r\nGreat Lakes as that of the most ardent and efficient champion of its\r\ncommercial development.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE GIVING THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY APPROPRIATIONS BY CONGRESS\r\n      FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF RIVERS AND HARBORS AND THE CONSTRUCTION\r\n      OF SHIP-CANALS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE GOVERNMENT:\r\n\r\n  ==============================================================\r\n                     YEARS.

James B. Eads for the jetty improvements at the mouth of\r\n  the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n  The total of these appropriations during the years of Mr.\r\n  Chandler's term as chairman was $45,610,800, or more than one-half\r\n  of the entire amount.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] Mr. Chandler entered the Senate when Congress was under the\r\ncontrol of Democratic majorities. He was in the minority, but he never\r\nfeared to assert his views, and denounce measures of doubtful advantage\r\nto the best interests of the country. The policy of the dominant party\r\nhad been uniformly adverse to internal improvements--especially to\r\nmaking appropriations for harbor and river improvements. Soon after\r\ntaking his seat, Mr. Chandler brought this important subject before\r\nthe Senate, and insisted upon the necessity of fostering and aiding\r\ninternal commerce. He introduced several measures, with this object in\r\nview.... These improvements were not then considered; but his vigorous\r\nspeeches and persistent efforts subsequently compelled their partial\r\nrecognition, and Mr. Chandler was placed on the Committee of Commerce,\r\nof which he was made chairman when the Republican party came into\r\npower, and so continued to the end of his Senatorial labors. It is\r\nnot too much to say, for it is only the truth, that to Mr. Chandler's\r\nuntiring zeal in this capacity, the country is indebted for many of\r\nthose magnificent harbor and river improvements, which have been made\r\nsince the Republican party came into power. Says a recent writer--an\r\nexcellent authority, \"The evidences of their utility are seen on every\r\nhand, scattered along our seaboard, along our extended lake coast,\r\nand upon all our rivers. The beneficent effects of these improvements\r\nare demonstrated by our vastly-increased and increasing commerce, its\r\ngreater safety, the economy with which the work is performed, the\r\nextraordinary development of our agricultural and mineral resources\r\nand the increased compensation of productive labor.\" Reference is\r\nthus made to Mr. Chandler's efforts in behalf of those great internal\r\nimprovements in aid of the commerce and internal development of the\r\ncountry, in order to demonstrate his peculiar fitness for the position\r\nwhich he has just been commissioned to fill.--_Editorial of the\r\nWashington Chronicle of Oct. 20, 1875, announcing the appointment of\r\nZachariah Chandler as Secretary of the Interior._\r\n\r\n[14] There were no appropriations for these purposes prior to 1822.\r\n\r\n[15] This sum was contained in bills which were passed over the\r\nPresident's veto and included the first appropriation for the St. Clair\r\nFlats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE OUTBREAK OF THE REBELLION--NO COMPROMISE OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news of the election of Abraham Lincoln to the Presidency of the\r\nUnited States--through strictly constitutional methods, by a large\r\nmajority of the electoral vote and by a plurality of over half a\r\nmillion in the popular vote--was received with cheering and expressions\r\nof joy in many of the Southern cities. The men who exulted there were\r\nthose who believed that with this pretext sectional passion could\r\nbe kindled into instant rebellion, and they at once set about the\r\nwork of consummating disunion before the close of the term of the\r\ntraitorous and imbecile administration of James Buchanan. On Nov. 12,\r\n1860, South Carolina ordered the election of a convention to take\r\nthe formal step of secession, and the other cotton States promptly\r\nfollowed its example. Congress met on the 3d of December, and listened\r\nto a message from President Buchanan, in which he said: \"After much\r\nserious reflection I have arrived at the conclusion that no power to\r\ncoerce into submission a State which is attempting to withdraw, or\r\nhas actually withdrawn, from the confederacy, has been delegated to\r\nCongress or to any other department of the Federal government. It is\r\nmanifest upon an inspection of the constitution that this is not among\r\nthe specific and enumerated powers granted to Congress; and it is\r\nequally apparent that its exercise is not 'necessary and proper for\r\ncarrying into execution' any one of these powers.\" On December 20 South\r\nCarolina adopted its ordinance of secession. Mississippi did likewise\r\non Jan. 9, 1861, Florida on January 10, Alabama on January 11, Georgia\r\non January 18, Louisiana on January 26, and Texas on February 1. On\r\nFeb. 4, 1861, a convention of delegates from the seceding States met in\r\nthe city of Montgomery and proceeded to form and organize the \"Southern\r\nConfederacy.\" These events were attended by popular demonstrations\r\nthroughout the South, in which the Union was denounced with unstinted\r\nbitterness and its power defied with the utmost audacity, and by the\r\nactive drilling of the local militia and the organization of large\r\nbodies of armed men. More than all this, the officers of the United\r\nStates in that section abandoned their positions, and sub-treasuries,\r\npost-offices, large sums of money, arsenals, arms, ammunition,\r\nfortifications, and vessels of the United States were seized in all the\r\nleading cities of the South, and used to prepare for war upon the power\r\nfrom which they had been stolen. The value of the government property\r\nthus confiscated by the rebels before the nation fired a shot was not\r\nless than $30,000,000. On Jan. 5, 1861, the United States steamer Star\r\nof the West was fired upon in the harbor of Charleston and driven\r\nout to sea, and within that month a bloodless siege of Fort McRae at\r\nPensacola compelled its surrender to rebel forces by a United States\r\ngarrison. Amid these events the traitors in Buchanan's Cabinet boldly\r\nresigned their portfolios, and Southern Congressmen with insolent words\r\nleft their seats at the capitol \"to join their States.\" The President\r\nhimself was fitly described by Henry Winter Davis as \"standing\r\nparalyzed and stupefied amid the crash of the falling republic, still\r\nmuttering, 'Not in my time; not in my time; after me the deluge.'\"\r\n\r\nThere were three ways of meeting these overt acts of high treason,\r\nnamely: (1.) Submitting, either by sympathy and connivance, by frank\r\nsurrender, or by an equally effective supineness. (2.) Meekly offering\r\nto rampant rebellion the bribe of fresh concessions to slavery. (3.)\r\nTreating armed secession as treason and its promoters as traitors,\r\nand dealing with it and them as such. The first method did not lack\r\nfor supporters outside of the South. Thousands of Northern Democrats\r\njustified secession and promised the cotton States support. Their\r\npapers predicted that in case of war \"it would be fought in the\r\nNorth,\"[A] that \"no Democrat would be found to raise an arm against his\r\nbrethren of the South,\"[16] and that \"if troops should be raised in\r\nthe North to march against the people of the South, a fire in the rear\r\nwould be opened upon such troops which would either stop their march\r\naltogether or wonderfully accelerate it.\"[17] The Mayor of the great\r\ncity of New York suggested in his annual message that that metropolis\r\nmight well consider if the time did not seem to be at hand when it\r\ncould profitably throw off allegiance to the United States and erect\r\nitself into \"a free city.\" In public meetings and in party conventions\r\nlike utterances were heard and applauded, all justifying the\r\ndeclaration of Lawrence M. Keitt in the city of Charleston that \"there\r\nare a million of Democrats in the North who, when the Black Republicans\r\nattempt to march upon the South, will be found a wall of fire in their\r\nfront.\" These sympathizers with rebellion were reinforced by the\r\nholders of anti-coercion theories, by commercial timidity, and--most\r\nunexpectedly--by some Republican sentiment in favor of permitting\r\npeaceful separation rather than facing civil war. This sentiment was\r\nfortunately short-lived and not cowardly in its origin, but it found an\r\nadvocate in, and was given public expression by, the most influential\r\nRepublican journalist of that period, Horace Greeley, and it did much\r\nto encourage rebel arrogance and to distract the national councils.\r\nBut that was the most numerous class which comprised the men who\r\nproposed to meet actual civil war with servile tenders to traitors in\r\narms of new guarantees for slavery and with humble petitions for their\r\nacceptance. With the meeting of Congress in December, 1860, these\r\ngentlemen became the conspicuous figures at Washington, and for three\r\nmonths labored industriously upon compromise schemes, every one of\r\nwhich was, in its essence, a proposition that Freedom should do homage\r\nto Slavery, and that the verdict of the people at the polls should\r\nbe shamefully reversed to placate men who had deliberately plotted\r\ntreason, and who again and again rejected with frank contempt offers\r\nof \"conciliation.\" There were some who co-operated in these movements\r\nfor the sake of gaining time and keeping the border States out of\r\nrebellion until Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated, but the great source\r\nof the compromise clamor of that winter was either some feeling of\r\nfriendliness to the slave power or moral flaccidity.\r\n\r\nIt need not be said that Mr. Chandler was not found in either of these\r\nclasses. For three years he had regarded this crisis as imminent. He\r\ndid not believe that the South would now abandon its cherished dream\r\nof independent empire for any compromise. He did not propose to shrink\r\nback one inch before armed rebellion or to surrender one iota of\r\nprinciple to traitorous threats. He went to Washington determined to\r\nmaintain the supremacy of the government at every cost, to listen to no\r\nplans of concession, to offer to disunionists only the alternative of\r\nobedience to the constitution or the penalties of treason, and to labor\r\nincessantly to stir into indignant action the slumbering sentiment of\r\nnationality in the hearts of the Northern people. It is in such hours\r\nthat men of his indomitable stamp step to the front, and he became at\r\nonce a pioneer leader of that uncompromising and tireless spirit which\r\nwas the citadel of the Union cause. He spoke but rarely on political\r\nquestions during the last session of the Thirty-sixth Congress, but was\r\nactive in all the Republican consultations of that eventful period. In\r\nthem he steadfastly opposed any policy that savored of bending to or\r\ntemporizing with rebellion, and in the face of not a little Republican\r\ndemoralization urged that the crisis should be met with the spirit\r\nof Jackson and of Cromwell. Speaking of this session he afterward\r\nsaid: \"If I could have had my way, when treason was proclaimed on the\r\nfloor of the Senate the traitor would never have gone free from the\r\ncapitol.\" With the Southern leaders he was frank in his denunciations\r\nof their course and plans. In a chance conversation at this time with\r\nthe craftiest of their number, Slidell of Louisiana, he asked how the\r\npending struggle would end, and Slidell replied, \"Oh, we will all go\r\nout, and the Union will be broken up.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what are you going to do with the mouth of the Mississippi?\" said\r\nMr. Chandler.\r\n\r\n\"We will, of course, have to seize and hold that,\" was the answer, \"but\r\nwe will not tax your commerce.\"\r\n\r\nTo this, Mr. Chandler's indignant response was, \"We own that river, Mr.\r\nSlidell; we bought and paid for it; and, by the Eternal, we are going\r\nto keep it. It was a desert when we bought it, and we will make it a\r\ndesert again before we will let you steal it from us.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler labored assiduously to thwart the plots of the rebel\r\nleaders, and to make such preparation as was possible for the coming\r\nstrife. It was at this time that he formed that close intimacy with\r\nEdwin M. Stanton, which continued until the death of \"the Carnot of the\r\nUnited States.\" Mr. Stanton, as the Attorney-General of the Buchanan\r\nCabinet in its closing months, rendered service of the largest value\r\nto the nation by urging vigorous measures on his imbecile chief, by\r\nboldly confronting the traitors who were among his colleagues, and\r\nby secretly and promptly informing the Republican leaders of each\r\nnew development of the disunion conspiracy as revealed in Cabinet\r\nconsultations. His information and counsels furnished sure guidance at\r\na time of the greatest peril, and this it was that led to the early\r\nappointment by Mr. Lincoln to the Secretaryship of War of a man whom\r\nthe public then chiefly knew as a minor Cabinet officer in a detested\r\nadministration. Mr. Chandler always rated Mr. Stanton's services to the\r\nUnion cause in the early months of 1861 as second only in value to his\r\nherculean labors in the War Department; placed the highest estimate\r\nupon his ability, vigor, and patriotism; aided greatly in securing\r\nhis appointment and confirmation as one of Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet;\r\nremained his firm friend and counselor, and was largely instrumental\r\nin obtaining from President Grant the nomination to the justiceship of\r\nthe Supreme Court which so shortly preceded his death. It was also at\r\nthis time that Mr. Chandler began to distrust the political fidelity of\r\nMr. Seward, whose spoken suggestions of compromise and whose persistent\r\nnegotiations with rebel emissaries, however diplomatic in origin and\r\nintent, were fruitful sources of Southern hope and Northern weakness.\r\nTime increased rather than diminished this dislike, and Mr. Chandler\r\nwas always an impatient critic of Mr. Seward's influence upon the\r\nLincoln administration, and saw in the course of the Secretary of State\r\nof Andrew Johnson's Cabinet only the fulfillment of his own suspicions\r\nand predictions.\r\n\r\nThe secret history of these exciting days, teeming with incident and\r\nconcealing many startling revelations, has yet been but sparingly\r\nwritten; it is doubtful if the veil will ever be more than slightly\r\nlifted. Mr. Chandler himself guarded scrupulously from public knowledge\r\nmuch that was well known to him and a few associates and would have\r\nshed light on the hidden springs of actions of vast moment. This class\r\nof information he treated as state secrets, whose perishing with\r\nthe actors in the great drama was desirable for public reasons. A\r\nwell-known Washington journalist, who dined one day with Mr. Chandler\r\nand Mr. Wade, and listened with interest to their reminiscences of \"war\r\ntimes,\" suggested to these gentlemen that their recollections should be\r\nrecorded while they were still fresh for the benefit of history, and\r\ndid succeed at first in obtaining their consent to an arrangement by\r\nwhich the two \"war Senators\" were to devote one evening in each week\r\nto the relation of the inside history of the period between the fall\r\nof 1860 and the end of Johnson's administration. These narratives were\r\nto be taken down by a stenographer, whose notes were to be written\r\nout, carefully compiled, and subjected to the revision of Messrs.\r\nChandler and Wade. The manuscript was then to be sealed and placed in\r\nsuch keeping as should make it certain that it would not be published\r\nuntil the lapse of many years. On the following Saturday night the\r\nliterary gentleman was promptly at Mr. Chandler's residence with the\r\nstenographer. Mr. Wade shortly afterward came in, and at once said:\r\n\"I have been thinking this matter over, Chandler, and you must allow\r\nme to decline. There is no use in telling what we know unless we tell\r\n_the whole truth_, and if I tell the whole truth I shall blast too\r\nmany reputations. These things would be interesting and valuable if\r\nthey were preserved in a book, but they would not be as valuable as\r\nthe reputations that would be destroyed. The days we were going to\r\ntalk about were exciting days, when good men made mistakes, and their\r\nmistakes ought to be forgotten.\" Mr. Chandler promptly assented, and\r\nthe reminiscences were never written.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate at this time Mr. Chandler's course was bold and\r\nstraightforward. On Feb. 19, 1861, he denounced on its floor \"traitors\r\nin the Cabinet and imbeciles in the Presidential chair.\" He steadfastly\r\nopposed the Crittenden Compromise, well described by Charles Sumner\r\nas \"the great surrender to slavery,\" and the circumstances of his\r\nopposition to \"the Peace Congress\" attracted national attention then\r\nand afterward. The Legislature of Virginia in January, 1861, adopted\r\nresolutions inviting a conference of delegates from the various States\r\nto meet at Washington on February 4, and consider how the pending\r\n\"unhappy controversy\" could be adjusted by (of course) some plan giving\r\n\"to the people of the slaveholding States adequate guarantees for the\r\nsecurity of their rights.\" Twenty-two States answered this invitation,\r\nand their representatives, presided over by John Tyler, deliberated in\r\nWashington for nineteen days, and in the end recommended to Congress a\r\nso-called \"compromise measure,\" which was thus justly characterized at\r\nthe time: \"Forbearing all details, it will be enough to say that they\r\nundertook to give to slavery positive protection in the constitution,\r\nwith new sanction and immunity--making it, notwithstanding the\r\ndetermination of the fathers, national instead of sectional; and, even\r\nmore than this, making it one of the essential and permanent parts of\r\nour republican system.\" Its origin and its avowed object made this body\r\ndistrusted from the outset by the sincere anti-slavery men, who did\r\nnot believe that it could accomplish anything except to still farther\r\ndebauch the public mind of the North. The result proved that it was\r\ncalled in the interest of slavery, and was designed to strengthen\r\nthat system. Mr. Chandler from the outset opposed all Republican\r\nparticipation in this Congress, and, through the urgent recommendations\r\nof its Senators, Michigan was one of the five Northern States which did\r\nnot send delegates. But after the Congress had met and was at work, it\r\nwas thought that the friends of freedom on its floor might be able to\r\naccomplish something if they were increased in numbers, and accordingly\r\napplication was made to Mr. Chandler and Mr. Bingham to procure the\r\nappointment by their State of delegates who could take their seats\r\nbefore final action was reached. Under such circumstances those\r\ngentlemen telegraphed to Lansing a request for the appointment of a\r\ndelegation, and followed the message up with letters of the same tenor,\r\nwhich, although in the nature of private communications to Governor\r\nBlair, were shown at Lansing, and soon appeared in the newspapers; they\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, Feb. 11, 1861.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR GOVERNOR: Governor Bingham and myself telegraphed you on\r\n  Saturday, at the request of Massachusetts and New York, to send\r\n  delegates to the Peace or Compromise Congress. They admit that we\r\n  were right and that they were wrong; that no Republican States\r\n  should have sent delegates but they are here, and cannot get away.\r\n  Ohio, Indiana and Rhode Island are caving in, and there is danger\r\n  of Illinois; and now they beg of us for God's sake to come to their\r\n  rescue, and save the Republican party from rupture. I hope you will\r\n  send _stiff-backed_ men or none. The whole thing was gotten up\r\n  against my judgment and advice, and will end in thin smoke. Still I\r\n  hope as a matter of courtesy to some of our erring brethren, that\r\n  you will send the delegates. Truly your friend,\r\n\r\n                                                            Z. CHANDLER.\r\n\r\n  _His Excellency Austin Blair._\r\n\r\n  P. S. Some of the manufacturing States think a fight would be\r\n  awful. Without a little blood-letting, this Union will not, in my\r\n  estimation, be worth a rush.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, Feb. 10, 1861.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR: When Virginia proposed a convention in Washington, in\r\n  reference to the disturbed condition of the country, I regarded\r\n  it as another effort to debauch the public mind and a step toward\r\n  obtaining that concession which the imperious slave power so\r\n  insolently demands. I have no doubt, at present, but that was the\r\n  design. I was therefore pleased that the Legislature of Michigan\r\n  was not disposed to put herself in a position to be controlled\r\n  by such influences. The convention has met here, and within a\r\n  few days the aspect of things has materially changed. Every free\r\n  State, I think, except Michigan and Wisconsin, is represented, and\r\n  we have been assured by friends upon whom we can rely, that, if\r\n  those two States should send delegations of true, unflinching men,\r\n  there would probably be a majority in favor of the constitution\r\n  as it is, who would frown down the rebellion by the enforcement\r\n  of laws. These friends have urged us to recommend the appointment\r\n  of delegates from our State, and in compliance with their\r\n  request, Mr. Chandler and myself telegraphed to you last night.\r\n  It cannot be doubted that the recommendations of this convention\r\n  will have a very considerable influence upon the public mind and\r\n  upon the action of Congress. I have a great disinclination to\r\n  any interference with what should properly be submitted to the\r\n  wisdom and discretion of the Legislature, in which I place great\r\n  reliance. But I hope I shall be pardoned for suggesting that it\r\n  may be justifiable and proper by any honorable means to avert the\r\n  lasting disgrace which will attach to a free people who, by the\r\n  peaceful exercise of the ballot, have just released themselves from\r\n  the tyranny of slavery, if they should now succumb to treasonable\r\n  threats, and again submit to a degrading thraldom. If it should be\r\n  deemed proper to send delegates, I think if they could be here by\r\n  the 20th it would be in time. I have the honor, with much respect,\r\n  to be, Yours truly,\r\n\r\n                                                          K. S. BINGHAM.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of Michigan refused to follow even these\r\nrecommendations (although an effort to make the two Senators\r\nthemselves delegates received a strong support), and that State was\r\nnot represented at any stage of the abortive Peace Congress. On the\r\n27th of February Senator Powell of Kentucky presented to the Senate\r\nnewspaper copies of these letters, and then moved to lay aside the\r\narmy appropriation bill which was pending, in order that the Senate\r\ncould proceed at once to amend the constitution. He added that it\r\nmight \"better be at that than be appropriating money to support an\r\narmy that is to be engaged, it seems, in the work of blood-letting.\"\r\nMr. Chandler followed by stating that the letter was a private one of\r\nwhich no copy had been preserved, but that whether the printed copy was\r\naccurate or not he adopted it as his, and would at another time speak\r\non the questions it involved. He added: \"The people of Michigan are\r\nopposed to all compromises. They do not believe that any compromise is\r\nnecessary; nor do I. They are prepared to stand by the constitution of\r\nthe United States as it is, to stand by the government as it is; aye,\r\nsir, to stand by it to blood if necessary.\" On the 2d of March Mr.\r\nChandler made his promised speech in reply to Mr. Powell. He commenced:\r\n\"I desire to ask the Senator whether, after we have adopted this or\r\nany other compromise, he is prepared to go with me, and with the\r\nUnion-loving men of this nation, for enforcing the laws of the United\r\nStates in the thirty-four States of this Union.\" Powell's response was:\r\n\"I am for enforcing the laws in all the States that are within the\r\nUnion, but I am opposed to making war on the States that are without\r\nthe Union. I am opposed to coercing the seceded States.... We have no\r\nright, under the constitution, to make war on those States.\" Upon this\r\nfrank admission from one of its most ardent advocates of the utter\r\nfruitlessness of compromise, this confession that it would be a sale\r\nwithout consideration, Mr. Chandler's comment was: \"That is just what\r\nI expected; it is just what I want the North to know; that those men\r\nwho profess to be for the Union with an 'if' are against it under all\r\ncircumstances.\" He then quoted the letter of Thomas Jefferson written\r\nat Paris on Nov. 13, 1787, to Colonel Smith, and closing as follows:\r\n\r\n  And what country can preserve its liberties if the rulers are not\r\n  warned from time to time that the people preserve the spirit of\r\n  resistance? Let them take up arms! The remedy is to set them right\r\n  as to facts; pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost\r\n  in a century or two? The Tree of Liberty must be refreshed from\r\n  time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its\r\n  natural manure.\r\n\r\nAnd with this authority of Thomas Jefferson on \"a little blood-letting\"\r\nas his text, Mr. Chandler spoke nearly an hour, denouncing the\r\ntreason about him with unsparing vigor and branding the Democracy\r\nas responsible for the impending crime against the nation. In the\r\nface of such distempers he did not hesitate to pronounce war for the\r\nsuppression of rebellion the only adequate remedy. The tone and style\r\nof this speech will appear from these extracts:\r\n\r\n  This is not a question of compromise. It is a question whether\r\n  we have or have not a government. If we have a government it is\r\n  capable of making itself respected abroad and at home. If we\r\n  have not a government, let this miserable rope of sand which\r\n  purports to be a government perish, and I will shed no tears\r\n  over its destruction. Sir, General Washington reasoned not so\r\n  when the whisky rebellion broke out in Pennsylvania; he called\r\n  out the _posse comitatus_ and enforced the laws. General Jackson\r\n  reasoned not so when South Carolina in 1832 raised the black flag\r\n  of rebellion; he said: \"By the Eternal, I will hang them;\" and he\r\n  would have done it.\r\n\r\n  After these illustrious examples, we are told that six States\r\n  have seceded, and the Union is broken up, and all we can do is\r\n  to send commissioners to treat with traitors with arms in their\r\n  hands; treat with men who have fired upon your flag; treat with\r\n  men who have seized your custom-houses, who have erected batteries\r\n  upon your great navigable waters, and who now stand defying your\r\n  authority! What will be the result of such a treaty? You would\r\n  stand disgraced before the nations of the earth, your naval\r\n  officers would be insulted by the Algerines, your bonds would not\r\n  be worth the paper on which they are written, to-morrow. If you\r\n  submitted to this degradation your government would stand upon a\r\n  par with the governments of South America and the Central American\r\n  States.\r\n\r\n  Sir, I will never submit to this degradation. If the right is\r\n  conceded to any State to secede from the Union, without the consent\r\n  of the other States, I am for immediate dissolution; and if the\r\n  State which I have the honor in part to represent will not follow\r\n  that advice, I, for one, upon my own responsibility and alone,\r\n  will resign my seat in this body, and leave this government, so\r\n  soon as I can prepare the small matters I shall have to arrange,\r\n  _for emigration to some country where they have a government_.\r\n  I would rather join the Comanches; _I will never live under a\r\n  government that has not the power to enforce its laws_.... I see\r\n  before me some of those men who have been fighting this corrupt\r\n  organization (the Democratic party) for the last twenty years,\r\n  who now turn about in dismay at the threatened disruption of the\r\n  government. Why are they terror-stricken? Why do they not stand\r\n  firm and denounce you as infamously connected with a plundered\r\n  treasury instead of cowering before your threats? This thing has\r\n  gone far enough.... Sir, this Union is to stand; it will stand\r\n  when your great-grandchildren and mine shall have grown gray--aye,\r\n  when they shall have gone to their last account, and their\r\n  great-grandchildren shall have grown gray. But the traitors who\r\n  are to-day plotting against this Union are to die. I do not say,\r\n  literally, that they are all to die personally and absolutely; but\r\n  they are soon to pass from the stage, and better and purer men\r\n  are to take their places. God grant that that consummation, \"so\r\n  devoutly to be wished,\" may be early accomplished!...\r\n\r\n  For the Union-loving men of this nation, for the true patriots of\r\n  the land, there is no reasonable concession that I would not most\r\n  cheerfully make; but for those men who profess to be Union men and\r\n  who are Union men with an \"if\"; who will take all the concessions\r\n  we will give them--all that they demand--and then turn about and\r\n  say \"your Union is dissolved,\" I have no respect; and for them I\r\n  will do nothing. For the men who love this Union, who are prepared\r\n  to march to the support of the Union, who will stand up in defense\r\n  of the old flag under which their fathers fought and gloriously\r\n  triumphed, I have not only the most profound respect, but to their\r\n  demands I can scarce conceive anything that I would not yield. But,\r\n  sir, when traitorous States come here and say, unless you yield\r\n  this or that established principle or right, we will dissolve the\r\n  Union, I would answer in brief words--no concession, no compromise;\r\n  aye, give us strife even to blood before yielding to the demands of\r\n  traitorous insolence.\r\n\r\nThis \"blood letter\" (as it was commonly termed) Mr. Chandler was often\r\ncalled upon to meet in the course of his subsequent public life, and\r\nhe never failed to justify its writing or to stand by its language. In\r\nthe extra session of the Senate in March, 1861, John C. Breckenridge\r\nalluded to \"Senatorial threats of blood-letting,\" and Mr. Chandler\r\nretorted by re-reading Jefferson's letter and re-asserting the purpose\r\nto meet attempted treason with force. In the last session of the\r\nThirty-seventh Congress (on Feb. 13, 1863) William A. Richardson of\r\nIllinois said in a debate upon a war loan measure:\r\n\r\n  The Senator from Michigan, at the outset of this controversy,\r\n  declared in a letter to the Governor of the State of Michigan, that\r\n  this government was not worth a rush without some blood-letting.\r\n  Standing in array against all our history for seventy years,\r\n  standing in array against the peace of the country for seventy\r\n  years, the constitution itself in every proceeding from that time\r\n  to this being but compromise, he declared at the outset against any\r\n  compromise for the peace of the country, and he is responsible to a\r\n  very large extent for the arbitrament of war that is now upon us.\r\n  He is responsible for those consequences that are now flowing to\r\n  us from the position assumed then strongly by him at the head of a\r\n  dominant party in the country.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler was prompt in meeting this attack, and said:\r\n\r\n  Mr. President: I do not propose to-day to go over my record. It has\r\n  been made before the country and the world. There let it stand.\r\n  So far as my loyalty and devotion to the country are concerned,\r\n  I doubt if any man ever seriously attempted to cast suspicion on\r\n  them. But, as I said before, my record is made. I stand upon it\r\n  and am proud of it in all its entirety. The Senator alluded to the\r\n  blood-letting letter, as it is called in Michigan. That letter\r\n  has been discussed before the people of that State. Thousands and\r\n  tens of thousands, and, for aught I know, hundreds of thousands\r\n  of copies of it, were scattered broadcast throughout that State.\r\n  What were the circumstances under which that letter was written?\r\n  We had traitors in this body proclaiming from day to-day that this\r\n  government was then destroyed, and there was no rebuke from the\r\n  Senator of Illinois or his friends. There was no rebuke from the\r\n  administration then in power, whom he aided in placing there. They\r\n  proclaimed that the government was entirely destroyed; and that it\r\n  should never be restored. Senators proclaimed on this floor that\r\n  you might give them a blank sheet of paper and allow them to fill\r\n  it as they pleased, and still they would not live with us under the\r\n  same government.... Here in this hall and in the other chamber,\r\n  and on the streets wherever you went, you heard traitors declare\r\n  that the government was ended, declare that if you attempted to\r\n  coerce the rebel States it would lead to war. I believed then, as I\r\n  believe now, that they intended to break up this government; that\r\n  they intended a disruption of the nation. And I believed then, as\r\n  I believe now, that without the intervention of armed force to put\r\n  down armed rebels and traitors, your government was destroyed.\r\n  Believing it, I so wrote to the governor of a sovereign State--a\r\n  confidential note, it is true, but that is of no account. I stand\r\n  by that letter precisely as it was written. A majority of the\r\n  people of this nation believe to-day, as I believed then, that\r\n  there was and could be but one way to save the nation, and that\r\n  was by putting down armed rebels by force. That is what I believed\r\n  then, what I believe now.\r\n\r\n  Another thing the Senator says: Nobody is more responsible for this\r\n  bloody and wicked war than myself. Mr. President, let us look a\r\n  little into the matter of responsibility. There is a responsibility\r\n  somewhere, and a fearful responsibility, for this rebellion and\r\n  this dreadful war, but that responsibility is not upon my soul....\r\n  You may go through all the ranks of rebeldom, aye, sir, you may\r\n  take all the officers of your regular army, who have deserted by\r\n  hundreds and violated their oath, and gone into the ranks of the\r\n  enemy, and are fighting to overturn the government; go and poll the\r\n  whole of them, and you cannot find one that ever co-operated with\r\n  me politically. They are all Democrats, every man. Yes, sir, and go\r\n  among the officers of the navy who have deserted and gone over to\r\n  the enemy, and are now fighting against their flag and attempting\r\n  to overturn this government; poll them, and among all the hundreds\r\n  of them you cannot find a single Republican--not one. No, sir, they\r\n  are all Democrats, every man. You may go and poll the whole four or\r\n  five hundred thousand men the rebels have now in arms against this\r\n  government, and you cannot find a man who was ever a Republican or\r\n  who even sympathized with the Republicans. They are all Democrats\r\n  or \"Union men\" such as we had here two years ago, men who had\r\n  professed to be for the Union when their hearts were with the\r\n  enemies of the government. Sir, go among the Northern sympathizers\r\n  with the rebellion, the men who are proclaiming to-day that this\r\n  government is overturned, and that it will never be restored, who\r\n  are to-day denouncing your currency and saying that your money is\r\n  not worth the paper upon which it is written; search through all\r\n  the sympathizers with this rebellion, and you cannot find a man who\r\n  ever co-operated with me politically--not one. They are Democrats,\r\n  but yet, forsooth, I am responsible for this war.... I have no\r\n  responsibility for this rebellion, nor have the party with which\r\n  I act. We have with perfect unanimity, in every instance, come up\r\n  to the support of the government. When the government demanded\r\n  400,000 men, every single individual on this side of the house\r\n  voted to give them 500,000 men. And when they demanded $400,000,000\r\n  to support the government, every man on this side of the house\r\n  voted to give them $500,000,000 to save the nation. Sir, we have\r\n  been ready under all circumstances to make any and every sacrifice\r\n  so that this nation might be saved. Our armies are in large force\r\n  and ably commanded; they are ready to advance and crush the\r\n  hydra-headed monster of rebellion. Aye, sir, but we have an enemy\r\n  insidious and dangerous. The seat of the rebellion is to-day not in\r\n  Richmond, it is among the copper-headed traitors of the North, and\r\n  if this government is overturned, if we should fail in saving the\r\n  government, it will be, not from the force of rebels in our front,\r\n  but because of the accursed traitors in our rear.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a debate in the Senate on Feb. 16, 1866, upon\r\nreconstruction topics, Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana said:\r\n\r\n  When the good and the patriotic, North and South, representing the\r\n  yearning hearts of the people at home, came here in the winter\r\n  and spring of 1861, in a peace congress, if possible to avoid\r\n  this dreadful war, then the Senator from Michigan announced to\r\n  his Governor and the country that this Union was scarcely worth\r\n  preserving without some blood-letting. His cry before the war\r\n  was for blood. Allow me to say that when the Senator's name is\r\n  forgotten because of anything he says or does in this body, in\r\n  future times it will be borne down upon the pages of history as the\r\n  author of the terrible sentiment that the Union of the people that\r\n  our fathers had cemented by the blood of the Revolution and by the\r\n  love of the people; that that Union, resting upon compromise and\r\n  concession, resting upon the doctrine of equality to all sections\r\n  of the country; that that Union which brought us so much greatness\r\n  and power in the three-quarters of a century of our life; that\r\n  that Union which had brought us so much prosperity and greatness\r\n  until we were the mightiest and proudest nation on God's footstool;\r\n  that that grand Union was not worth preserving unless we had some\r\n  blood-letting. Mr. President, it is not the sentiment of the\r\n  Senator's own heart; it is the expression of a bitter political\r\n  hostility; but it will carry him down to immortality; he is sure of\r\n  living in history; he has gained that much by it.\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. Chandler's response was instant. He said:\r\n\r\n  The Senator from Indiana has arraigned me upon an old indictment\r\n  for having written a certain letter in 1861. It is not the first\r\n  time I have been arraigned on that indictment of \"blood-letting.\"\r\n  I was arraigned for it upon this floor by the traitor John C.\r\n  Breckenridge, and I answered the traitor John C. Breckenridge,\r\n  and after I gave him his answer he went out to the rebel ranks\r\n  and fought against our flag. I was arraigned by another Senator\r\n  from Kentucky, and by other traitors upon this floor; I expect to\r\n  be arraigned again. I wrote the letter, and I stand by the letter\r\n  and what is in it. What was the position of the country when the\r\n  letter was written? The Democratic party as an organization had\r\n  arrayed itself against this government--a Democratic traitor in the\r\n  Presidential chair, and Democratic traitors in every department\r\n  of this government, Democratic traitors preaching treason upon\r\n  this floor and preaching treason in the hall of the other House,\r\n  Democratic traitors in your army and in your navy, Democratic\r\n  traitors controlling every branch of this government. Your flag\r\n  was fired upon and there was no response. The Democratic party\r\n  had ordained that this government should be overthrown, and I, a\r\n  Senator from the State of Michigan, wrote to the Governor of that\r\n  State \"unless you are prepared to shed blood for the preservation\r\n  of this great government the government is overthrown.\" That is\r\n  all there was in that letter. That I said, and that I say again.\r\n  And I tell that Senator, if he is prepared to go down in history\r\n  with the Democratic traitors who then co-operated with him, I am\r\n  prepared to go down on that \"blood-letting\" letter, and I stand by\r\n  the record as made.\r\n\r\n  Because I wrote to the Governor of my State that unless he was\r\n  prepared to shed blood for the preservation of this government\r\n  it was overthrown, now I aim to be arraigned as going down to be\r\n  remembered in history! Yes, sir, I shall be remembered, and I\r\n  am proud of the record. May it stand, and stand as long as this\r\n  government stands! When that Senator and the men who co-operated\r\n  with him shall have gone down to eternal infamy my record will be\r\n  brilliant.\r\n\r\nIn the closing session of Mr. Chandler's Congressional service Senator\r\nBenjamin H. Hill of Georgia, in the course of a reply (on May 10, 1879)\r\nto a declaration of his on the previous day that \"there were twelve\r\nSenators on the other side whose seats were obtained and are held by\r\nfraud and violence,\" again read and commented upon \"the blood letter.\"\r\nMr. Chandler promptly answered as follows:\r\n\r\n  Mr. President, this is the fourth time since 1861 that allusion\r\n  has been made to a letter written by me to the Governor of the\r\n  State of Michigan; first it appeared in a newspaper published in\r\n  Detroit; a copy was sent to me and a copy was likewise sent to\r\n  the late Senator Powell. The letter was a private note written to\r\n  the Governor and no copy retained. Senator Powell approached me\r\n  with his copy of the letter and asked if it was correct. I told\r\n  him I did not know; I had written to the Governor of Michigan a\r\n  private note and had kept no copy and could not say whether this\r\n  was correct or not. He told me that if it was a correct copy he\r\n  would wish to make use of it, and if it was not he did not propose\r\n  to make use of it. I said, \"Sir, I will adopt it, and you may make\r\n  any use of it you please.\" So to-day that is my letter. If not\r\n  originally written by me, it is mine by adoption.\r\n\r\n  And, Mr. President, what were the circumstances under which that\r\n  letter was written? I had been in this body then nearly four years\r\n  listening to treason day by day and hour by hour. The threat, the\r\n  universal threat daily, hourly, was, \"Do this or we will dissolve\r\n  the Union; if you do not do that we will dissolve the Union.\"\r\n  Treason was in the White House, treason in the Cabinet, treason\r\n  in the Senate, and treason in the House of Representatives; bold,\r\n  outspoken, rampant treason was daily and hourly uttered. The threat\r\n  was made upon this floor in my presence by a Senator, \"You may\r\n  give us a blank sheet of paper and let us fill it up as we please,\r\n  and then we will not live with you.\" And another Senator stood\r\n  here beside that Senator from Texas and said, \"I stand by the\r\n  Senator from Texas.\" Treason was applauded in the galleries of this\r\n  body, and treason was talked on the streets, in the street cars,\r\n  in private circles; everywhere it was treason--treason in your\r\n  departments, traitors in the White House, traitors around these\r\n  galleries, traitors everywhere!\r\n\r\n  The flag of rebellion had been raised; the Union was already\r\n  dissolved, we were told; the rebel government was already\r\n  established with its capital in Alabama; \"and now we will negotiate\r\n  with you,\" was said to us. Upon what basis would you negotiate?\r\n  Upon what basis did you call your peace convention? With rampant\r\n  rebellion staring us in the face! Sir, it was no time to negotiate.\r\n  The time for negotiation was past.\r\n\r\n  Sir, this was the condition of affairs when that letter was\r\n  written; and after Mr. Powell had made his assault upon me in this\r\n  body for it I responded, relating what I have related here now with\r\n  regard to it, and I said, \"I stand by that letter,\" and I stand by\r\n  it now. What was there in it then, and what is there in it now? The\r\n  State of Michigan was known to be in favor of the constitution and\r\n  the Union and the enforcement of the laws, even to the letting of\r\n  blood if need be, and that was all there was and all there is in\r\n  that letter. Make the most of it!\r\n\r\n  The Senator from Georgia says that I did not shed any blood. How\r\n  much blood did he shed?[18] [Laughter.] Will somebody inform us the\r\n  exact quantity of blood that the Senator from Georgia shed?\r\n\r\n  Mr. HILL, of Georgia: The difference between us is that I was not\r\n  in favor of shedding anybody's blood.\r\n\r\n  Mr. CHANDLER: Nor I, except to punish treason and traitors. Sir,\r\n  the Senator is not the man to stand up on this floor and talk\r\n  about other men saving their own blood. He took good care to put\r\n  his blood in Fort Lafayette where he was out of the way of rebel\r\n  bullets as well as Union bullets. He is the last man to stand up\r\n  here and talk to me about letting the blood of others be shed.\r\n\r\n  Mr. President, I was then, as I am now, in favor of the government\r\n  of the United States. Then, as now, I abhorred the idea of State\r\n  sovereignty over National sovereignty. Then, as now, I was prepared\r\n  even to shed blood to save this glorious government. Then, as now,\r\n  I stood up for the constitution and the Union. Then, as now, I was\r\n  in favor of the perpetuity of this glorious government. But the\r\n  Senator from Georgia, was, as he testified before a committee, \"a\r\n  Union secessionist.\" I have the testimony here before me. Will\r\n  somebody explain what that means--\"a Union secessionist?\" Mr.\r\n  President, I should like to see the dictionary wherein a definition\r\n  can be found of \"a Union secessionist!\" I do not understand the\r\n  term. He says they have the right to have a solid South, but a\r\n  solid North will destroy the government. Why, Mr. President, the\r\n  South is no more solid to-day than it was in 1857.... It has been\r\n  solid ever since, and it was no quarrel with the North that made\r\n  it solid. It was solid because it was determined either to \"rule or\r\n  ruin\" this nation. It tried the \"ruin\" scheme with arms; and now,\r\n  having failed to ruin this government with arms, it comes back to\r\n  ruin it by withholding supplies to carry on the government. Sir,\r\n  the men have changed since 1857. There is now but one member on\r\n  this floor who stood here with me on the 4th of March, 1857. The\r\n  men have changed, the measures not at all. You then fought for the\r\n  overthrow of this government, and now you vote and talk for the\r\n  same purpose. You are to-day, as you were then, determined either\r\n  to rule or ruin this government, and you cannot do either.\r\n\r\nThis letter was also for years constantly quoted and denounced by the\r\nDemocratic press of Michigan with the hope of by this means breaking\r\nthe Senator's hold upon the confidence of the people of his State. He\r\nuniformly met these attacks, not only without the shadow of apology,\r\nbut with the most emphatic defiance. On the stump he repeatedly\r\ndeclared that \"that letter was a good one,\" that he would not qualify\r\na sentence nor retract a word of it, that he \"stood by it\" without\r\nreservation, and that he believed when he wrote it and knew afterward\r\nthat it pointed out the only path in which the nation could then walk\r\nwith honor and with safety. Time has shown that Mr. Chandler was right\r\nand that the men who deprecated his boldness were wrong, and that the\r\nreal statesmanship of the winter of 1860-61 was that which proposed not\r\nto parley with, but to draw the sword upon, \"foul treason.\" The paper\r\nwhich at that time first printed \"the blood letter\" and made it the\r\ntext for unsparing and constant denunciation of its author was edited\r\nby a man who grew to be one of the foremost of American journalists,\r\nand--always hostile to Republicanism--published in 1879 the chief\r\nNorthwestern organ of Independent opinion, which said, in announcing\r\nMr. Chandler's sudden death in its city: \"To superior intellectual\r\nendowments he united a force of will and resolution of purpose that\r\nhesitated at no obstacle. Few men ever displayed in a more remarkable\r\ndegree the courage of opinions. No dread of unpopularity, no fear of\r\nconsequences, ever troubled him. His famous 'blood-letting letter,'\r\nwritten near the opening of the Southern rebellion, was a faithful\r\nmanifestation of the man. When frightened party chiefs of the North\r\nwere running up and down with peace propositions to placate Southern\r\nfire-eaters and patch up a new truce between free civilization and\r\nslave barbarism, Zach. Chandler stood up in his place in the Senate\r\nand in terms of intense, bitter scorn, denounced all such efforts as\r\nthe pitiful manifestations of political cowardice and folly. He had no\r\nword of regret to utter upon the departure of the Southern Senators;\r\nbut told them that the North would whip them back, and that in their\r\nhumiliation the bond of nationality would be strengthened. He had no\r\ndread of the threatened blood-letting, but believed it to be the only\r\nway of curing the Southern ulcer, and that the nation would afterward\r\nbe the healthier for it.\" And\r\n\r\n         \"Thus the whirligig of Time brings in his revenges.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] Bangor, Me., \"Union.\"\r\n\r\n[17] Detroit, Mich. \"Free Press.\"\r\n\r\n[18] An allusion to the common report that, during a secret session\r\no£ the Confederate Senate, William. L. Yancey received injuries in a\r\npersonal encounter with H. H. Hill from which he finally died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CIVIL WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln reached Washington on the 23d of February, 1861, having\r\ncome from Harrisburg _incognito_, and in advance of the announced\r\ntime, because of threats of assassination. Mr. Chandler was one of the\r\nfirst persons informed of his arrival, called upon him at once, and\r\nwas in frequent consultation with him thereafter with reference to the\r\nformation of his Cabinet and the policy to be pursued toward the South.\r\nMr. Chandler earnestly opposed placing any but the most uncompromising\r\nUnion men at the head of the departments, urged bold and decisive\r\nmeasures toward armed traitors for the sake of the moral effect of such\r\na course, and advised the most emphatic declarations in the inaugural\r\nof the President's intention to enforce the laws at all hazards. Mr.\r\nLincoln had seriously thought of inviting two gentlemen from the\r\nSouthern States to seats in his Cabinet, the names chiefly considered\r\nby him being those of Alexander H. Stephens of Georgia, and James\r\nGuthrie of Kentucky. Mr. Chandler strongly opposed any such concession\r\nto the rampant dis-unionism of the slave States, and the hostility\r\nof the wing of the party with which he acted finally led Mr. Lincoln\r\nto abandon his original plan and select Edward Bates of Missouri and\r\nMontgomery Blair as the Southern members of the Cabinet. Mr. Chandler\r\nalso advised that Breckenridge, Wigfall, and other avowedly disloyal\r\nCongressmen should be arrested at once, and urged that the \"Secession\r\nCommissioners,\" when they came to Washington, should be dealt with\r\nsummarily as traitors and not be permitted to even informally negotiate\r\nwith the Administration. He always believed that this summary\r\ntreatment of rebellion at the outset would have greatly curtailed its\r\ndimensions, but the President was guided by Mr. Seward and others,\r\nwhose counsels were different and who hoped to prevent the impending\r\nwar by mildness. Accordingly the inaugural was almost apologetic in\r\ntone toward the South; throughout March, men like Stephen A. Douglas\r\ninquired whether the Administration meant peace or war; flagrant\r\ntreason was still defiantly uttered on the floor of Congress, and John\r\nForsyth and M. J. Crawford, embassadors from the \"Confederacy,\" spent\r\nweeks in Washington holding relations with the new Secretary of State\r\nwhich, if not \"official,\" looked like a concession in fact of the\r\npractical independence of the seceded States. The first official favor\r\nMr. Chandler asked from President Lincoln was the appointment of his\r\nlife-long friend, James M. Edmunds, as Commissioner of the General Land\r\nOffice, and Mr. Edmunds was promptly nominated to that position and\r\nconfirmed by the Senate.\r\n\r\nAt noon on March 4, 1861, Vice-President Hamlin took the chair of the\r\nSenate and directed the secretary to read this proclamation convening\r\nan extra session of that body:\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT of THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS, Objects of interest to the United States require that the\r\n  Senate should be convened at twelve o'clock on the 4th of March\r\n  next, to receive and act upon such communications as may be made to\r\n  it on the part of the Executive: Now, therefore, I, James Buchanan,\r\n  President of the United States, have considered it to be my duty\r\n  to issue this, my proclamation, declaring that an extraordinary\r\n  occasion requires the Senate of the United States to convene\r\n  for the transaction of business, at the capitol in the city of\r\n  Washington, on the 4th day of March next, at twelve o'clock at noon\r\n  on that day, of which all who shall at that time be entitled to act\r\n  as members of that body are hereby required to take notice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [L. S.]]\r\n\r\n    Given under my hand and the seal of the United States at\r\n        Washington, the 11th day of February, in the year of our\r\n        Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, and of the\r\n        independence of the United States of America the eighty-fifth.\r\n\r\n                                                         JAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n  By the President: J. S. BLACK, _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\nSixteen new Senators then took the oath of office, and at fifteen\r\nminutes past one o'clock James Buchanan and Abraham Lincoln entered the\r\nSenate chamber, arm in arm, accompanied by Senators Foote, Baker and\r\nPearce, members of the Committee of Arrangements, and were conducted\r\nto seats in front of the secretary's desk. In a few moments afterward,\r\nthose assembled in the Senate chamber proceeded to the platform on the\r\ncentral portico of the eastern front of the capitol, to listen to the\r\ninaugural address of the President elect. Then the oath of office was\r\nadministered to him by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and the\r\nadministration of the government by the Republican party had commenced.\r\nThe business of this extra session of the Senate was chiefly limited to\r\nthe confirmation of executive appointments, although there were some\r\nexciting discussions upon the political situation. Mr. Chandler, on\r\ntaking possession (as the new chairman) of the room of the Committee\r\non Commerce, had his righteous wrath at the men who had availed\r\nthemselves of their official positions to plot treason against the\r\ngovernment still further stimulated by finding in one of the drawers\r\nof the large committee table the original draft of the secession\r\nordinance of Alabama, which had been prepared in the national capitol\r\nby Senator Clement C. Clay, his predecessor in the chairmanship of\r\nthe committee.[19] This illustration of Southern perfidy Mr. Chandler\r\ncarefully kept, and at his death it was among his private papers. The\r\nexecutive session of the Senate closed on March 28, 1861, and Mr.\r\nChandler at once returned to Detroit.\r\n\r\nAt 5.20 A. M. on April 12, 1861, a mortar in the rebel battery on\r\nSullivan's Island in the harbor of Charleston fired a shell into Fort\r\nSumter. This was the announcement to the world of the decision of the\r\nrebels to delay no longer, but to at once\r\n\r\n                                  \"ope\r\n    \"The purple testament of bleeding war.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 13th Major Anderson abandoned the unequal contest, and\r\nsurrendered the blazing ruins of his fortress to Beauregard; on the\r\n14th his garrison marched out with the honors of war; and on the 15th\r\nAbraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers, a force which it was\r\nbelieved would trample out rebellion in ninety days. The North answered\r\nCharleston's cannon and the President's appeal with a magnificent\r\nassertion of its latent patriotism, and the war spirit flamed up in\r\nevery State. On April 17 the business men of Detroit held a public\r\nmeeting at the invitation of its Board of Trade, at which the firm\r\npurpose to support the government in its contest with treason was\r\nemphatically declared, and all needed assistance in troops and money\r\nwas pledged. Senator Chandler escorted General Cass to this gathering,\r\nand their entrance, arm in arm, typifying as it did the solidification\r\nof the Union sentiment of the North, was followed by long-continued\r\ncheering. Both gentlemen spoke in tones of earnest loyalty and amid\r\nconstant applause. That night the following letter was mailed to\r\nWashington:\r\n\r\n                                        DETROIT, April 17, 1861.\r\n\r\n  _Hon. Simon Cameron._\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR: One of the most distinguished Democrats in this\r\n  country[20] says: \"Don't defend Washington. Don't put batteries on\r\n  Georgetown Heights, but shove your troops directly into Virginia,\r\n  and quarter them there.\"\r\n\r\n  Stand by the Union men in Virginia and you will find plenty of them.\r\n\r\n  By this bold policy you will save Virginia to the Union as well as\r\n  the other border States.\r\n\r\n  There is but one sentiment here. We will give you all the troops\r\n  you can use. We will send you two regiments in thirty days,\r\n  and 50,000 in thirty days more if you want them. General Cass\r\n  subscribed $3,000 to equip the regiments.\r\n\r\n  There are no sympathizers here with treason, and if there were we\r\n  would dispense with their company forthwith. Your friend,\r\n\r\n                                                            Z. CHANDLER.\r\n\r\nMichigan justified her Senator's pledges by promptly raising and\r\nequipping many more troops, than the State was required to furnish\r\nunder the call for 75,000 volunteers, and this correspondence soon\r\nfollowed:\r\n\r\n                                        DETROIT, April 21, 1861.\r\n\r\n  _Hon. Simon Cameron._\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR CAMERON: ... I will esteem it a very great favor if you\r\n  will officially call for at least one more regiment to go to the\r\n  front immediately from this State. You did not call for but one,\r\n  but we have got two all ready, and have raised $100,000 by private\r\n  subscription to equip them. Truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                                            Z. CHANDLER.\r\n\r\n  [REPLY.]\r\n\r\n                                     WASHINGTON, April 29, 1861.\r\n\r\n  _Hon. Z. Chandler._\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR: ... It would give me great pleasure to gratify your\r\n  wishes, but this can only be done in one way. The President has\r\n  determined to accept no more for three months' service, but to add\r\n  to the regular army twenty-five more regiments whose members shall\r\n  agree to serve two years unless sooner discharged. This will enable\r\n  the Department to accept another regiment from your State. Truly\r\n  yours,\r\n\r\n                                      SIMON CAMERON, _Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\nTo this suggestion the response was prompt, and the enlistment of men\r\nand formation of companies for three years' service went briskly on,\r\nMichigan sending only one three-months' regiment to the field. Mr.\r\nChandler was active in stimulating and organizing the war movements at\r\nhome, both by untiring personal labor and by liberal subscriptions of\r\nmoney, until the first regiments were ready for marching orders. He\r\nwas one of the speakers at an imposing Union meeting held in Detroit\r\non April 25, with Lewis Cass in the chair, and he there said: \"A\r\ngreater contest than the Revolutionary war is now about to take place.\r\nIt is to be tested whether a republican government can stand or not.\r\nThe eyes of all Europe are upon us, and we will convince them that\r\nours is the strongest government on earth.\" He also made an earnest,\r\nand in the end successful, effort to procure from the War Department\r\nsuch orders as should obtain for the Michigan men an opportunity for\r\nprompt service against the enemy. It was originally intended to send\r\nthe regiments from his State to Cairo, but his influence accomplished\r\na change in this plan and they were directed to report to Washington\r\nfor immediate duty. In May Mr. Chandler went to the capital to aid in\r\npreparing for their reception and to urge upon the authorities, who\r\nwere then declining the profuse offers of troops, the importance of\r\naccepting all the regiments tendered by his own and other States and\r\nof promptly attacking the constantly growing rebellion by invading\r\nits territory and interfering with the organization of its armies.\r\nOn the 17th of May, 1861, the First Regiment of Michigan Volunteers\r\narrived in Washington, Col. O. B. Willcox commanding. They were met at\r\nthe depot by Senator Chandler and escorted to quarters he had aided\r\nin securing for them in a business block on Pennsylvania Avenue. Mr.\r\nChandler was active in providing for their comfort, purchased supplies\r\nfor them out of his own private purse, was present at their parade when\r\nthey were formally mustered into the service of the United States by\r\nAdjutant-General Thomas, and asked the Secretary of War to send them at\r\nonce to the front for active duty. His request was complied with and\r\nthis regiment was prominent in the first important military movement of\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nAfter he had seen the Michigan troops well cared for, Mr. Chandler, on\r\nthe 19th of May, in company with Senators Wade and Morrill and John\r\nG. Nicolay, the private secretary of President Lincoln, sailed for\r\nFortress Monroe to visit General Butler, and see the condition of his\r\nnewly-organized army. On the following day the party started to return\r\non the steamer Freeborn, and as they were passing through Hampton Roads\r\nheard heavy cannonading, which proved to be an artillery duel between\r\nthe steamer Monticello and a battery erected by the rebels at Sewell's\r\nPoint, where the Elizabeth river empties into Hampton Roads. The\r\nFreeborn went at once to the assistance of the Monticello, and being of\r\nlight draft approached within 300 yards of the battery and opened fire\r\nwith her guns. The columbiads of the Virginians were soon disabled, and\r\nthe rebels were scattered in every direction, Mr. Chandler pronouncing\r\nthe spectacle \"the best ball-playing he had ever seen.\" On her voyage\r\nup the Potomac the Freeborn seized two suspicions boats, and found them\r\nloaded with a company of fifty rebel soldiers on their way to join\r\n\"the Confederate army.\" Both vessels were brought to the Navy Yard at\r\nWashington and they were the first prizes taken during the war, and the\r\nmen on board were the first rebel prisoners captured.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 23d of May, the Union forces at Washington crossed\r\nthe Potomac and proceeded to seize and fortify advantageous positions\r\non Virginia soil. The First Michigan accompanied the famous Zouave\r\nregiment by ferry-boats to Alexandria, taking possession of that city\r\nin the night. Mr. Chandler went with the Michigan men, and was the only\r\ncivilian who was allowed to accompany this wing of the expedition. He\r\nwas with a detachment of soldiers who surprised and captured a party of\r\nforty rebel dragoons, including four officers, and he was in Alexandria\r\nwhen Colonel Ellsworth fell and private Brownell instantly avenged his\r\ndeath. Of this event, since obscured by four years of carnage, but\r\nwhich then first brought to excited millions some sense of the dreadful\r\nrealities of war, he was the first to bear the news to the authorities\r\nat Washington.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler remained at the capital some weeks, working industriously\r\nin helping on the preparations for war, and urging the most vigorous\r\nand sweeping measures upon the Administration. He believed and said\r\nrepeatedly that the call for 75,000 men for three months was a mistake.\r\nHe was no optimist, and never thought that a rebellion, so carefully\r\norganized and left so long undisturbed, could be subdued without a\r\ndesperate and bloody struggle. He thought that 500,000 rather than\r\n75,000 volunteers should have been called for to serve through the\r\nwar, and judged that the effect of such a proclamation upon the\r\ncountry, and particularly upon the South, would have been salutary, as\r\nshowing the determination of the government to crush the rebellion at\r\nonce and forever. While the raw levies of volunteers were massing in\r\nWashington in May and June, there was a lamentable lack of discipline\r\nand organization. The commissary department of the army was feeble and\r\ninefficient, and there was a want of proper and sufficient food for the\r\nsoldiers. Mr. Chandler's executive capacity was very useful then to the\r\nSecretary of War in assisting in the organization of a commissariat\r\nand in procuring supplies and equipments, and he spent no small sum\r\nin obtaining food for the soldiers when the regular rations were not\r\nforthcoming. Although entirely without military training, Mr Chandler's\r\nbusiness experience, his quick perception, and his clear judgment made\r\nhis services at this period of confusion and mismanagement of great\r\nvalue to the country. In June he returned to Michigan for a few days,\r\nand on the 21st of that month spoke (with the Hon. Charles M. Croswell)\r\nat Adrian, on the occasion of the presentation by the ladies of that\r\ncity of a stand of colors to a volunteer regiment in camp there.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of July, 1861, the Thirty-seventh Congress met in extra\r\nsession, and adjourned on the 6th of August, after having enacted laws\r\nto increase the army and navy, and to provide the means and authority\r\nnecessary for the vigorous prosecution of the war. The scope of the\r\nwork undertaken by this Congress was far greater than that of any\r\npreceding session. Many of the members had but little experience in\r\nlegislative matters, but their patriotism was sincere and ardent, and\r\ntheir acts embodied the national purpose to maintain the integrity of\r\nthe republic at any cost. On the second day of the session Mr. Chandler\r\nsaid in the Senate:\r\n\r\n  I desire to give notice that I shall to-morrow or on some\r\n  subsequent day introduce a bill to confiscate the property of\r\n  all Governors of States, members of the Legislature, Judges of\r\n  Courts, and all military officers above the rank of lieutenant\r\n  who shall take up arms against the United States, or aid or abet\r\n  treason against the government of the United States, and that said\r\n  individual shall be forever disqualified from holding any office of\r\n  honor, emolument or trust under this government.\r\n\r\nThis bill was introduced on July 15, and was referred to the Committee\r\non the Judiciary; it reported back a measure of much narrower scope,\r\nwhich was passed, and is known as the confiscation act of 1861. The\r\norigin of Mr. Chandler's bill was the fact that John Y. Mason of\r\nVirginia, who had been expelled from the Senate for treason, owned a\r\nlarge amount of property in Pennsylvania, and so indignant were the\r\npeople of the county in which it was located at his treachery, that a\r\nguard was kept over it constantly to prevent its destruction by a mob.\r\nMr. Chandler believed it was important that the government should be\r\nenabled to legally seize for its own use such property as this; there\r\nwere also many officers of the army and navy who were undecided whether\r\nto go with the rebellion or remain at their posts. He wished to add\r\nto the penalties of treason to affect them, as well as those wealthy\r\ncitizens of Washington and Maryland who had formerly been in office\r\nand who sympathized with the rebellion and gave the South as much\r\nencouragement as they dared. His proposition proved then too vigorous\r\nto obtain the endorsement of his colleagues, but within a year its\r\nprinciple received Congressional sanction. During this session (on July\r\n18) Mr. Chandler said in the Senate with characteristic force:\r\n\r\n  The Senator from Indiana says there are three parties in the\r\n  country. I deny it, sir. There are but two parties, patriots and\r\n  traitors--none others in this body nor in the country. I care not\r\n  what proposition may be brought up to save the Union, to preserve\r\n  its integrity, patriots will vote for it; and I care not what\r\n  proposition you may bring up to dissolve the Union, to break up\r\n  this government, traitors will vote for that. And those are the\r\n  only two parties there are in the Senate or the country.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to add that Mr. Chandler voted at this session\r\nfor every measure to organize armies and to raise means for their\r\nmaintenance, and that he favored at all times vigorous and summary\r\nmeasures in dealing with the enemies of the republic.\r\n\r\nGeneral McDowell's \"invasion of Virginia\" on May 23 was followed by\r\nseveral weeks of military inactivity on the Potomac, broken only by a\r\ndash of the Union cavalry into Fairfax Courthouse and the skirmish at\r\nVienna, where a regiment of Ohio troops, who were backed on a railroad\r\ntrain into a rebel ambuscade, lost twenty men. On July 16 the Union\r\narmy began a forward movement against the rebels who were found in\r\nposition about and along a creek known as Bull Run. After a short\r\nand indecisive engagement on that day, General McDowell commenced to\r\nconcentrate his forces for an attack on Beauregard's line, but various\r\ndelays prevented any definite movement until Sunday, July 21. On that\r\ndate was fought the battle of Bull Run, ending in a complete Union\r\ndefeat, attended by severe losses and a panic-stricken retreat by many\r\nregiments, and followed by great national dismay and alarm. An inquiry\r\ninto the blundering strategy, political half-heartedness, and poor\r\ngeneralship, which were the causes of this unnecessary and most serious\r\nreverse, are foreign to the purpose of this work. Mr. Chandler was one\r\nof a large number of members of Congress who joined the army on the eve\r\nof battle, and watched its progress to the final disaster. The First\r\nMichigan was among the regiments engaged in the thickest of the fight,\r\nand the Second and Third were in the brigade of Gen. I. B. Richardson,\r\nwhich acted as a rear-guard in the retreat of the army and prevented\r\ndefeat from becoming a total rout. Mr. Chandler himself aided in\r\nhalting and rallying the panic-stricken fugitives,[21] and reached\r\nWashington late at night, covered with mud and wearied with travel\r\nand hunger. He drove at once to the White House, where he found Mr.\r\nLincoln despondent, exhausted with his labors, and greatly depressed\r\nby the defeat and the loss of life involved. Mr. Chandler urged upon\r\nthe President the necessity of vigorous measures, the wisdom of calling\r\nfor more troops, and the certainty that the North would follow the\r\nAdministration in meeting a reverse with undismayed and redoubled\r\nenergies. He asked Mr. Lincoln to issue an order for the enrolling of\r\n500,000 men at once, \"to show to the country and the rebels that the\r\ngovernment was not discouraged a whit, but was just beginning to get\r\nmad.\" Mr. Chandler's vitality, the timely vigor of his bold words, and\r\nhis overwhelming earnestness acted as a tonic upon the over-burdened\r\nExecutive, and he left Mr. Lincoln cheered, encouraged and resolute.\r\nThe governors of the loyal States were at once appealed to for more\r\ntroops, and the answer of the North to Bull Run was the rush of tens\r\nof thousands of men into camp and the organization of great armies\r\nalong the Potomac, the Ohio and the Mississippi. Secretary Stanton,\r\nwho knew of this midnight interview, estimated its effect upon the\r\ncourse of events as of the utmost importance, and repeatedly said that\r\nMr. Chandler's opportunely-manifested courage and vigor then saved the\r\nUnion from a great peril.\r\n\r\nIn the task of reorganizing the army after Bull Run, of clearing\r\nWashington of fugitives, and of extracting order from chaos, Mr.\r\nChandler rendered important aid to the authorities, and after the\r\nadjournment returned to Michigan and threw his strong energies into\r\nthe work of raising and equipping troops. This letter (which was not\r\nfollowed by any practical results, owing to various causes) is of\r\ninterest as showing the spirit of those days:\r\n\r\n                                         DETROIT, Aug. 27, 1861.\r\n\r\n  _Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War._\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR CAMERON: A Colonel Elliott, member of the Canadian\r\n  Parliament, is desirous of raising a regiment of Canadian cavalry\r\n  for the war against treason. I don't know how the Administration\r\n  may look upon this proposition, but there are many reasons in favor\r\n  of its acceptance.\r\n\r\n  1. Colonel Elliott is a brave and experienced officer.\r\n\r\n  2. He is in favor of the closest union between the Canadas and the\r\n  United States, and believes that this fraternal union upon the\r\n  battle-field would tend strongly to cement a yet closer connection.\r\n\r\n  3. It would satisfy England that hands-off was her best policy.\r\n\r\n  The moment it is proven that black men are used in the Southern\r\n  army _against us_, I propose to recruit a few regiments of negroes\r\n  in Canada myself to meet that enemy, and I think this would be an\r\n  opening wedge for the movement of emancipation.\r\n\r\n  My colleague will introduce Colonel Elliott to you and explain more\r\n  at length. Truly, your friend,\r\n\r\n                                                            Z. CHANDLER.\r\n\r\nTo this same period also belongs this characteristic defense of his\r\nState and the Northwest against what Mr. Chandler believed--and with\r\nreason--to be an unjust statement:\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the New York World_:\r\n\r\n  My attention has been called to an article in your valuable and\r\n  patriotic paper in which you say: \"The extreme Northern States,\r\n  from Maine to Michigan, have not done their duty, and it is high\r\n  time that State pride aroused them to emulate the noble example\r\n  of New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island.\" As I am sure you\r\n  would not willingly do injustice to Michigan, I ask you to state\r\n  editorially, the population and the number of regiments in the\r\n  field for the war from each of the States whose example is to be\r\n  emulated. Michigan had at Bull Run one three-months' regiment (now\r\n  recruiting and in for the war) and three regiments for the war,\r\n  _and not a private soldier in camp in the State_. Since that time\r\n  she has sent seven regiments for the war, making ten regiments now\r\n  present in the army, in addition to which she furnished to other\r\n  States over 2,000 men, _now in the field_, for the reason that the\r\n  government would accept no more men from Michigan at that time,\r\n  and the patriotic ardor of our citizens could not be restrained.\r\n  We have now in camp nearly 4,000 men, and shall send two regiments\r\n  this week and two more within a few days.\r\n\r\n  The Northwest has done her whole duty; how is it with the East?\r\n  The Northwest has exceeded every call made upon her, and yet you\r\n  lack men and are denuding over 2,000 miles of border territory of\r\n  troops for the defense of Washington. If New York, Pennsylvania,\r\n  New Jersey, and the New England States cannot defend Washington, in\r\n  God's name what can they do? The Northwest will defend the lines\r\n  from the mountains of Virginia to the Rocky Mountains. She will\r\n  sweep secession and treason from the valley of the Mississippi,\r\n  aye, _and will defend the Potomac, too, if she must_. But is\r\n  not this Union worth as much to New York, Pennsylvania, and\r\n  Massachusetts as to the Northwest? Why, then, so tardy in supplying\r\n  troops? Had five of the forty Northwestern regiments now on the\r\n  Potomac been with Lyon he would have won the battle and cleared\r\n  Missouri! Had five been with Mulligan he would now be in possession\r\n  of Lexington! Could ten of them be sent into Kentucky to-morrow (in\r\n  addition to what they have) they would clear the State of secession\r\n  in ten days, and threaten Tennessee! Could ten be sent to Rosecrans\r\n  he would clear the mountains of Virginia and threaten the rear of\r\n  the grand army! But, no; this cannot be done--because the East will\r\n  not do her duty. If she does not at once, the whole world will cry\r\n  shame. Respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                                            Z.

Simon Cameron, Secretary of War._\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR: The time for delivering a battle upon the Potomac has\r\n  now passed, and something _must and can be done_. In my opinion the\r\n  following plan is still feasible, and will close the war:\r\n\r\n  Let Rosecrans be ordered immediately to Kentucky with his army\r\n  of veteran Northwestern troops. Substitute an equal or larger\r\n  number of Eastern troops with an Eastern general, who will act\r\n  strictly upon the defensive. Send your Northwestern troops now\r\n  upon the Potomac to Cairo _at once_. Send Pope (if he is the man)\r\n  to Missouri with sufficient arms to supply all the Northwestern\r\n  regiments in readiness to march on the 1st day of December. Let an\r\n  abundance of transports and material be provided at Cairo and St.\r\n  Louis, by that date (December 1st).\r\n\r\n  Give the order, \"Forward,\" and _then cut the wires_.\r\n\r\n  Stop all official communication with the Army of the Northwest.\r\n  That army, if thus untrammeled, will _spend New Year's day in New\r\n  Orleans_, _via_ Memphis, and will reach Washington _via_ Richmond\r\n  by the 1st of May next.\r\n\r\n  In the meantime Sherman, Butler, and Burnside can take care of\r\n  South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, and North Carolina will fall\r\n  of itself with Virginia and the Gulf States.\r\n\r\n  Is this plan feasible?\r\n\r\n  None but a traitor will say you Nay, for you and I know that\r\n  200,000 Northwestern soldiers, with Rosecrans's and Lyon's\r\n  veterans, _can_ and _will go wherever they are ordered_, and _on\r\n  time_.\r\n\r\n  As to your Army of the Potomac, select 100,000 men of your city\r\n  regiments which look well on parade, and keep them for reviews.\r\n  Send the balance to the Gulf States. We want none of them out West.\r\n\r\n  We will, by recruiting during the winter, keep our Grand Army up to\r\n  200,000 men, and furnish garrisons as fast as needed for captured\r\n  towns. Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                                            Z. CHANDLER.\r\n\r\nCongress re-assembled for its regular session in December, 1861,\r\nand Mr. Chandler was called upon (on Jan. 17, 1862) to present\r\nthe credentials of the Hon. Jacob M. Howard as his colleague from\r\nMichigan, _vice_ Kinsley S. Bingham, who had died suddenly in the\r\npreceding October. Mr. Howard remained a Senator for ten years, winning\r\ndistinction in that position. Throughout his term his relations with\r\nhis colleague were intimate and cordial, and the foremost merchant\r\nand the first lawyer of Michigan stood side by side in the Senate in\r\nthe support of every important measure which had for its object the\r\nencouragement of loyal sentiment, or the strengthening of the military\r\nand financial arms of the government, or the prompt suppression of the\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] Mr. Clay (C. C. Clay, Jr., of Alabama), chairman of the Committee\r\non Commerce, drew up in the room of that committee the original\r\nordinance of secession for the State of Alabama, while he, a rebel\r\ntraitor, was drawing the pay of this government. It was drawn upon\r\ngovernment paper, written with government ink, and copied by a clerk\r\ndrawing $6 a day from this government.

These gentlemen, armed with Maynard rifles and navy\r\nrevolvers, sprang from their carriages some three miles this side of\r\nCentreville, and, presenting their weapons, in loud voices commanded\r\nthe fugitives to halt and turn back. Their bold and determined manner\r\nbrought most at that point to a stand-still. Many on horseback, who\r\nattempted to dash by them, had their horses seized by the bits. Some of\r\nthe fugitives who were armed menaced these gentlemen. None, however,\r\nwere permitted to pass until the arrival of the Second New Jersey\r\nRegiment, on its way to the battle-ground, turned back the flying\r\nsoldiers and teamsters.--_Washington Intelligencer, July 22, 1861._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMITTEE ON THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the Congressional recess of the autumn of 1861 gross\r\nmismanagement led to the annihilation at Ball's Bluff of a brigade of\r\nUnion troops, led by Senator Edward D. Baker of Oregon. They had been\r\nsent across the Potomac in flat-boats and skiffs, were left without\r\nadequate support, and, being surrounded by a vastly superior force of\r\nrebels, were driven to the edge of the river, and there either killed,\r\nwounded, captured, or driven into hiding places along the banks. Their\r\ncommanding officer, who displayed throughout a high order of personal\r\ncourage, was shot at the head of his line before the final rout.\r\nGeneral Baker was a man of eloquence and many gallant qualities, and\r\nhis death created a profound impression; that he was sacrificed by\r\nmilitary incapacity cannot be doubted.\r\n\r\nCongress met on Dec. 2, 1861, and on the first business day of the\r\nsession Mr. Chandler offered a motion for the expulsion of John C.\r\nBreckenridge, who had at last joined the rebels, and it was unanimously\r\nadopted. On December 5 he introduced this resolution:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That a committee of three be appointed to inquire into\r\n  the disasters at Bull Run and Edward's Ferry (subsequently changed\r\n  to Ball's Bluff), with power to send for persons and papers.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler said, in explanation of his motion, that these reverses\r\nhad been attributed to politicians, to civilians, to everything but\r\nthe right cause, and that it was due to the Senate and to the country\r\nthat they should be investigated and that the blame should rest where\r\nit belonged. After some discussion the Senate adopted the resolution\r\nwith only three dissenting votes, first amending it by providing for\r\na joint committee of both branches, and by enlarging the scope of\r\nits inquiries so as to include \"the conduct of the war.\" The House\r\nconcurred in the action, and the famous \"Committee on the Conduct of\r\nthe War\" was thus created. On December 17, Mr. Chandler moved that the\r\nVice-President should appoint the Senate members, adding: \"I do not\r\nknow what the parliamentary usage may be in a case of this kind. If\r\nthat usage would give me the position of chairman, I wish to say that,\r\nunder the circumstances, I do not wish to accept it.\" Mr. Chandler\r\nhad also privately requested Mr. Hamlin to appoint Senator Wade to\r\nthe chairmanship, saying it was important that a lawyer should be\r\ngiven that place, and his desires were followed in both respects.\r\nThe first committee, as announced at that time, consisted of the\r\nfollowing Congressmen: On the part of the Senate, Benjamin F. Wade,\r\nZachariah Chandler and Andrew Johnson; on the part of the House,\r\nDaniel W. Gooch of Massachusetts, John Covode of Pennsylvania, George\r\nW. Julian of Indiana, and Moses F. Odell of New York. Of the original\r\ncommittee, George W. Julian is the only one who survived Mr. Chandler.\r\nWhen Andrew Johnson was appointed Military Governor of Tennessee, he\r\nresigned his position upon the committee, and Senator Joseph A. Wright\r\nof Indiana took his place. Mr. Wright served but a year, and after\r\nthe expiration of his term the Senate branch of the committee in the\r\nThirty-seventh Congress consisted of only Mr. Chandler and Mr. Wade.\r\nWilliam Blair Lord, now one of the official reporters of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, was appointed its clerk and stenographer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ZACHARIAH CHANDLER IN 1862.]\r\n\r\nThe tone of the Congressional discussion upon Mr. Chandler's\r\nproposition shows that this was regarded as an exceedingly important\r\nstep, for the resolution clothed the committee with powers of very\r\nunusual magnitude, which, if abused, must have seriously embarrassed\r\nthe Administration. Mr. Lincoln and Secretary Cameron, as well as\r\nGeneral Scott and General McClellan, opposed its appointment at the\r\noutset, but Mr. Chandler took prompt and successful measures to assure\r\nthe President that, if the plans of its projectors were carried\r\nout, the committee would be used only to strengthen the hands of\r\nthe Executive, and promised that it should be made a help and not a\r\nhindrance to the vigorous prosecution of the war. On this point the\r\nHon. James M. Edmunds, who was thoroughly informed as to the secret\r\nhistory of that period, has said:\r\n\r\n  The writer knows that the Administration was not without fear\r\n  that this was an unfriendly measure. A member of the Cabinet\r\n  expressed such fears to him, and said that the President had not\r\n  only expressed doubts as to the wisdom of the movement, but also\r\n  fears that the committee might, by unfriendly action, greatly\r\n  embarrass the Executive. On being told by the writer that the\r\n  measure was not so intended, but, on the contrary, that it was the\r\n  intention of the mover to bring the committee to the aid of the\r\n  Administration, he expressed much gratification, and said it was\r\n  of the utmost importance to bring such purpose to the knowledge\r\n  of the President in some authoritative way, and at the earliest\r\n  moment possible. This conversation was at once reported to Senator\r\n  Chandler, whereupon both he and Senator Wade went immediately to\r\n  the President and the Secretary of War, and assured them that it\r\n  was their purpose to bring the whole power of the committee to the\r\n  aid of the Executive. From this moment the most cordial relations\r\n  existed between the committee and the Administration.[22]\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln and Secretaries Cameron and Stanton ultimately\r\nplaced great reliance upon the committee, and constantly, throughout\r\nthe war, it gave them the most valuable assistance. Mr. Wade and Mr.\r\nChandler were deeper in the confidence of Secretary Stanton, from\r\ntheir connection with it, than were any other members of Congress, and\r\ndifferences of aim and opinion between them were exceedingly rare.\r\n\r\nUpon organizing for work the committee found itself confronted with\r\nan enormous task, inquiries into every phase of the organization and\r\nmanagement of the Union armies being referred to it for consideration.\r\n\"Upon the conduct of the war,\" to quote from its own report, \"depended\r\nthe issue of the experiment inaugurated by our fathers, after the\r\nexpenditure of so much blood and treasure--the establishment of a\r\nnation founded upon the capacity of man for self-government. The nation\r\nwas engaged in a struggle for its existence; a rebellion, unparalleled\r\nin history, threatened the overthrow of our free institutions, and the\r\nmost prompt and vigorous measures were demanded by every consideration\r\nof honor, patriotism, and a due regard for the prosperity and happiness\r\nof the people.\" And its sphere of duty was the constant watching of the\r\ndetails of movements, upon whose result depended such vast interests,\r\nas well as the safety of thousands of lives. The committee, in laying\r\nout its work, followed the suggestion of Mr. Chandler, which was,\r\nfirst, to obtain such information in respect to the conduct of the war\r\nas would best enable them to point out the mistakes which had been made\r\nin the past, and the course that promised to ensure the avoidance of\r\ntheir repetition; second, to collect such information as the many and\r\nlaborious duties of the President and Secretary of War prevented them\r\nfrom obtaining, and to lay it before them with those recommendations\r\nand suggestions which the circumstances seemed to demand. Working in\r\nsuch a field, the committee soon became a second Cabinet council,\r\nand its proceedings were constantly at the President's hand. Its\r\nsessions were nearly perpetual, and almost daily its members were in\r\nconsultation with the President or the Secretary of War. Many of its\r\ntransactions were never committed to paper, and, as the members were\r\nsworn to the strictest secrecy, will never be revealed. Secretary\r\nStanton was frequently present while the committee was in session, and\r\nits door was always open to him. There was never any lack of harmony\r\nbetween him and its chief members, but, on the contrary, the utmost\r\nconfidence was exchanged, and this committee was the right arm of the\r\nWar Department in the darkest days of the rebellion. Repeatedly, after\r\nthe examination of some important witness, did Mr. Chandler or Mr.\r\nWade go at once to the White House with the official stenographer,\r\nwhen Mr. Stanton would be sent for and the stenographic notes of the\r\nevidence would be read to the President and Secretary of War for their\r\ninformation and guidance. From such conferences there sprang many\r\nimportant decisions, and the files and records of the committee were\r\nconstantly referred to and relied upon as sources of exceedingly useful\r\nknowledge and hints both at the White House and at the War Department.\r\n\r\nMany subjects presented themselves for investigation, any one of which\r\nwould, in ordinary times, have required the exclusive attention of a\r\nseparate committee, and to follow out every line of inquiry suggested\r\nwas manifestly a practical impossibility. Therefore the committee\r\ndecided not to undertake any investigations into what might be\r\nconsidered side issues, but to keep their attention directed entirely\r\nto the essential features of the war, so that they could ascertain and\r\ncomprehend the necessities of the armies and the causes of disaster\r\nor complaint, and the methods of supplying the one and remedying the\r\nother. Attempts were made repeatedly to use its power to punish enemies\r\nor to avenge private grievances, but its members adhered resolutely to\r\nthe straightforward course originally marked out as the path of its\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nThe first subject which the committee carefully inquired into was the\r\ndefeat at Bull Run. Many witnesses were examined, chiefly officers\r\nwho were engaged in the battle--Generals Scott, McDowell, Meigs,\r\nHeintzelman, Butterfield, Fitz-John Porter, and others. The testimony\r\nwas very voluminous, but the committee reached an early and unanimous\r\nopinion as to the causes of the disaster. Their report, written by Mr.\r\nWade, said: \"That which now appears to have been the great error was\r\nthe failure to occupy Centreville and Manassas at the time Alexandria\r\nwas occupied, in May. The position at Manassas controlled the railroad\r\nconnections in all that section of the country.... The next cause of\r\ndisaster was the delay in proceeding against the enemy until the time\r\nof the three months' men was nearly expired. The enemy were allowed\r\ntime to collect their forces and strengthen their position by defensive\r\nworks.... There had been but little time devoted to disciplining\r\nthe troops and instructing them, even in regiments; hardly any\r\ninstruction had been given them in brigade movements, and none at all\r\nas divisions.\" General McDowell prepared a plan of campaign, which\r\nwas approved by the Cabinet, and the 9th of July was fixed upon as the\r\nday for the advance; but the movement did not commence until a week\r\nlater than the appointed time. Transportation was deficient, and there\r\nwas much delay resulting from lack of discipline among the troops, and\r\nwhen the battle came the Union forces were fatigued and not in good\r\nfighting condition. \"But,\" said the report, \"the principal cause of\r\nthe defeat was the failure of General Patterson to hold the troops of\r\nGeneral Johnston in the valley of the Shenandoah.\" Patterson had 23,000\r\nmen, while Johnston had but 12,000. Still, Patterson disobeyed the\r\norders of General Scott, which were to make offensive demonstrations\r\nagainst General Johnston so as to detain his army at Winchester, and\r\nif he retreated to follow him and keep up the fight. Those orders\r\nwere repeated every day for more than a week in the telegraphic\r\ncorrespondence between Scott and Patterson. Finally, General Scott\r\nheard of a large force moving from Patterson's front, and telegraphed,\r\n\"Has not the enemy stolen a march on you?\" To this Patterson replied,\r\n\"The enemy has stolen no march upon me,\" while at that very time his\r\nlarge army was watching an empty camp and Johnston was far on his way\r\nto reinforce the rebels at Manassas. Patterson did not discover that\r\nJohnston had gone until he was miles distant, and the consequence\r\nwas that McDowell had both Beauregard and Johnston to fight, while\r\nPatterson, with 23,000 men, was lying idle in his camp. This is the\r\nsubstance of the report of the Committee on the Conduct of the War\r\non the battle of Bull Run, and was the official announcement to the\r\ncountry of the inefficiency of the organization and generalship of the\r\nArmy of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nBut before the committee was organized the men who were responsible\r\nfor this failure had been displaced, and General McClellan had been\r\nmade the commander-in-chief. He had taken the reins of authority amid\r\nnational acclamations, and was then at the height of a remarkable\r\npopularity, which it is now known was adroitly stimulated for political\r\npurposes by the conservative press. But on the investigation into the\r\nsecond subject taken up by the committee (the disaster at Edward's\r\nFerry or Ball's Bluff) facts came to the knowledge of its members\r\nwhich created the suspicion in their minds that General Stone, who was\r\ncharged with the blame of that defeat, and who, as the scape-goat, was\r\narrested and imprisoned in Fort Lafayette, was not alone responsible\r\nfor the calamity, but that the real fault would be found higher up.\r\nThis suspicion they were never able to substantiate by absolute proof,\r\nand it was not expressed in any of their reports.\r\n\r\nThe third topic taken up by the committee was the military management\r\nof the Western Department, under General Fremont. This was an inquiry\r\nof special importance, for the reason that that officer, upon taking\r\ncommand at St. Louis, issued a proclamation declaring free all slaves\r\nwhose masters were engaged in rebellion against the United States.\r\nThis order caused a great excitement throughout the country, and the\r\nRepublican party was widely divided in opinion as to its legality\r\nand propriety. President Lincoln was conservative on the question,\r\nand revoked the Fremont order, much to the disappointment of Mr.\r\nChandler and the other more \"advanced\" Republicans. Hence the committee\r\napproached the subject with unusual interest, and, after a thorough\r\ninvestigation, made an elaborate report. That part of this document\r\nwhich relates to General Fremont's order in regard to slaves was signed\r\nby Messrs. Wade, Chandler, Julian, and Covode, and showed the ground on\r\nwhich these gentlemen then stood with regard to emancipation; it was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  But that feature of General Fremont's administration which\r\n  attracted the most attention, and which will ever be most prominent\r\n  among the many points of interest connected with the history of\r\n  that department, is his proclamation of emancipation. Whatever\r\n  opinion may be entertained with reference to the time when the\r\n  policy of emancipation should be inaugurated, there can be no doubt\r\n  that General Fremont at that early day rightly judged in regard\r\n  to the most effective means of subduing this rebellion. In proof\r\n  of that, it is only necessary to state that his successor, when\r\n  transferred to another department, issued a proclamation embodying\r\n  the same principle, and the President of the United States has\r\n  since applied the same principle to all the rebellious States; and\r\n  few will deny that it must be adhered to until the last vestige of\r\n  treason and rebellion is destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe committee heartily endorsed General Fremont's administration,\r\ndeclaring it to have been \"eminently characterized by earnestness,\r\nability, and the most unquestionable loyalty.\" They also examined into\r\nvarious minor military matters and movements, including, particularly,\r\nrebel barbarities and the return of slaves to their masters by the army.\r\n\r\nIt was as a member of the Committee on the Conduct of the War in the\r\nThirty-seventh Congress, and from the evidence taken in its inquiries,\r\nthat Mr. Chandler obtained the mass of information which enabled him\r\nto make the most important of his war speeches, that of July 16,\r\n1862, in which he exposed so conclusively General McClellan's utter\r\nincompetence. Ample as was the foundation of facts upon which rested\r\nthis effective arraignment of conspicuous incapacity, the attack was\r\none requiring genuine boldness, for it defiantly invited a storm of\r\ndenunciation and, if it had failed of justification by the event, would\r\nhave certainly ended its maker's political career. Notwithstanding\r\nhis tardiness, his timidity, his inefficiency as a commander in the\r\nfield, and his political sympathy with the more unpatriotic classes\r\nof the Northern people, General McClellan was still strong with the\r\npeople and entrusted with great powers. The Democracy warmly commended\r\nhis sentiments and methods, and labored incessantly to prevent any\r\ndiminution of his hold upon the public confidence. The Army of the\r\nPotomac yet regarded him as \"the young Napoleon,\" and its corps\r\ncommanders were, with but few exceptions, his personal adherents. The\r\nlong-suffering President was submitting with patience to his unjust\r\ncomplaints, after having labored incessantly to stimulate into activity\r\nhis chronic sluggishness, fearful, with characteristic over-caution,\r\nlest his summary removal should divide the North and breed a dangerous\r\ndisaffection in the face of the enemy among his troops. Many who did\r\nnot believe in the sincerity or ability of the man also smothered\r\ntheir distrust, for fear that criticism would only weaken the common\r\ncause and with the hope that even in his nerveless hands the mighty\r\nweapon of the national resources would at last fall--even if by its\r\nown weight only--on the enemy with decisive force. At this juncture,\r\nand under these circumstances, Mr. Chandler, with characteristic vigor\r\nof statement and plainness of speech, placed before the Senate and the\r\ncountry the demonstration of McClellan's imbecility.\r\n\r\nOriginally Mr. Chandler believed that McClellan's selection as the\r\npractical successor of General Scott was a wise one, and hoped to see\r\nhis organizing capacity in camp supplemented by enterprise and courage\r\nin the field. Distrust first sprang up with the persistent inaction\r\nof the Army of the Potomac throughout the last months of 1861, and it\r\nwas strengthened by contact with the man himself and the study of his\r\ncharacter and his plans. An illustration of how this change of opinion\r\nwas brought about is given in an incident which occurred in the room\r\nof the Committee on the Conduct of the War. That committee sent for\r\nGeneral McClellan as soon as they took up matters relating to his\r\ncommand, in order to consult with him informally as to the situation.\r\nThis was in January, 1861, while he was in Washington \"organizing\" his\r\narmy, and while there was no little impatience felt because he did\r\nnot move. He was not formally summoned before the committee then, but\r\nsimply called in for general consultation. After the regular business\r\nwas finished, Mr. Chandler asked him bluntly why he did not attack\r\nthe rebels. General McClellan replied that it was because there were\r\nnot sufficient means of communication with Washington; he then called\r\nattention to the fact that there were only two bridges and no other\r\nmeans of transportation across the Potomac.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler asked what the number of bridges had to do with an advance\r\nmovement, and McClellan explained with much detail that it was one\r\nof the most important features of skillful strategy that a commander\r\nshould have plenty of room to retreat before making an attack. To this\r\nMr. Chandler's response was:\r\n\r\n\"General McClellan, if I understand you correctly, before you strike at\r\nthe rebels you want to be sure of plenty of room so that you can run in\r\ncase they strike back!\"\r\n\r\n\"Or in case you get scared,\" added Senator Wade.\r\n\r\nThe commander of the Army of the Potomac manifested indignation at this\r\nblunt way of putting the case, and then proceeded at length to explain\r\nthe art of war and the science of generalship, laying special stress\r\nupon the necessity of having lines of retreat, as well as lines of\r\ncommunication and supply, always open. He labored hard to make clear\r\nall the methods and counter-methods upon which campaigns are managed\r\nand battles fought, and, as he was an accomplished master of the theory\r\nof war, succeeded in rendering himself at least interesting. After he\r\nhad concluded, Mr. Wade said:\r\n\r\n\"General, you have all the troops you have called for, and if you\r\nhaven't enough, you shall have more. They are well organized and\r\nequipped, and the loyal people of this country expect that you will\r\nmake a short and decisive campaign. Is it really necessary for you to\r\nhave more bridges over the Potomac before you move?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not that,\" was the answer, \"not that exactly, but we must bear in mind\r\nthe necessity of having everything ready in case of a defeat, and keep\r\nour lines of retreat open.\"\r\n\r\nWith this remark General McClellan left the room, whereupon Mr. Wade\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\"Chandler, what do you think of the science of generalship?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know much about war,\" was the reply, \"but it seems to me that\r\nthis is infernal, unmitigated cowardice.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee, after this interview, made a careful inquiry into the\r\nstrength of the rebel forces confronting the elaborate intrenchments\r\nabout Washington, and became convinced that the army at and about\r\nManassas was a handful compared with the magnificent body of troops\r\nunder McClellan's command. They submitted these facts to the President\r\nand his Cabinet at a special session held for that purpose, and urged\r\nthe importance of an instant advance. With one single exception (a\r\nCabinet officer) the heads of the departments and the committee agreed\r\nthat an offensive movement from the line of the Potomac into Virginia\r\nwas important and must be made. General McClellan promised that his\r\narmy should start, but it did not. Toward the close of the winter\r\nthe President ordered a general advance, but the Army of the Potomac\r\nstill remained immobile. Finally, on March 10, under the peremptory\r\norders of the President, it did advance to Centreville and found there\r\ndeserted camps, wooden guns, weak intrenchments, and traces of the\r\nretreat of not more than a single full corps of rebel troops. It was\r\nduring this most aggravating delay that members of the committee had\r\nanother characteristic interview with General McClellan. On the 19th of\r\nFebruary a sub-committee waited upon the Secretary of War[23] to ask\r\nwhy the army was idle, and why the city of Washington and the North\r\nside of the Potomac river were crowded with troops when the enemy was\r\nall in Virginia. Mr. Wade said that it was a disgrace to the nation\r\nthat Washington was thus allowed to remain to all intents and purposes\r\nin a state of siege. To this Secretary Stanton replied that the\r\ncommittee could not feel more keenly upon this subject than did he,\r\nthat he did not go to bed at night without his cheek burning with\r\nshame at this disgrace, and that the subject had received his earnest\r\nattention, but he had not been able to change the situation as he\r\nwished. General McClellan was then sent for, and Secretary Stanton\r\nstated to him the object of the visit, and repeated the inquiries as to\r\nwhy an advance movement was not made into Virginia, the rebels driven\r\naway from Washington, and the soldiers who were idle in their camps in\r\nand around the city sent to active duty.\r\n\r\nGeneral McClellan answered that he was considering the matter, but\r\nthat instant action was impossible, although he hoped that he would\r\nsoon be able to decide what ought to be done. The committee asked what\r\ntime he would require to reach a decision. He replied that it depended\r\nupon circumstances; that he would not give his consent to have the\r\ntroops about Washington sent over to the Virginia side of the Potomac\r\nwithout having their rear protected more fully, and better lines of\r\nretreat open; that he designed throwing a temporary bridge across the\r\nriver as soon as possible, and making a permanent structure of it at\r\nhis leisure. That would make three bridges, and then the requisite\r\nprecautions would be completed.\r\n\r\nMr. Wade replied, with great impatience, that with 150,000 of the best\r\ntroops the world ever saw, there was no need of more bridges; that the\r\nrebels were inferior in numbers and condition, and that retreat would\r\nbe treason. \"These 150,000 men,\" Mr. Wade said, \"could whip the whole\r\nConfederacy if they were given a chance; if I was their commander I\r\nwould lead them across the Potomac, and they should not come back until\r\nthey had won a victory and the war was ended, or they came in their\r\ncoffins.\" Mr. Wade spoke strongly and plainly throughout the interview,\r\nand the Secretary of War endorsed every word he uttered. The committee\r\nhad another conference with Secretary Stanton on the following day at\r\nhis residence, at which it was decided that they should co-operate\r\nwith him in an effort to persuade President Lincoln either to displace\r\nMcClellan or to compel him to commence an active campaign at once.\r\nOn the 25th of February this conference with the President was held,\r\nand it was followed by others, Senators Chandler and Wade finally\r\nthreatening to make the laggardness of the commander of the Army of the\r\nPotomac a subject of debate in the Senate, and to offer a resolution\r\ndirecting the President to order an advance forthwith. The first result\r\nwas what the committee were so anxious to accomplish. In March, the\r\narmies commenced to move, and McClellan, at last taking the field in\r\nperson, pushed out to Centreville, and then followed up this delayed\r\nadvance by his flank movement to the Peninsula, driving the rebels out\r\nof Yorktown by a month's work with the shovel, and following General\r\nJohnston up to Williamsburg, where a bloody victory was won, but its\r\nfruits were left ungathered. This campaign was short, bloody, and\r\nblundering, ending with the battle of Malvern Hill, which was also\r\ndeprived of its proper importance by McClellan's failure to follow up\r\nhis advantage with a prompt advance upon Richmond, and which thus in\r\nthe end amounted to but little more than another Union reverse. Mr.\r\nChandler always firmly believed that had McClellan moved toward the\r\nrebel capital and not toward his gunboats after Malvern Hill, the war\r\nwould have been shortened by two years.\r\n\r\nWhen it first became evident that General McClellan was, by sullenness\r\nand incapacity, throwing away advantages gained by the heroism of his\r\ntroops on the Peninsula, Mr. Chandler determined to denounce him on\r\nthe floor of the Senate, but was restrained by Mr. Stanton, who urged\r\nthat, while the campaign was still in active progress, there was yet\r\nsome hope of a change for the better, and that to destroy confidence in\r\na commanding officer under such circumstances might injure the army\r\nin the field. After Malvern Hill these reasons ceased to have force,\r\nand Mr. Chandler commenced the careful preparation of his speech. This\r\ntime the Secretary of War endorsed the timeliness as well as the truth\r\nof the _expose_, and the Committee on the Conduct of the War by formal\r\nvote authorized the use of the testimony taken before it and not yet\r\nmade public. After he had gathered and grouped the facts which formed\r\nthe basis of his arraignment, Mr. Chandler submitted them to a friend\r\nupon whose good judgment and sincerity he greatly relied, and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Knowing all these facts, as I do, what is my duty?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer was: \"Beyond all question, these facts ought to be laid\r\nbefore the country, for the knowledge of them is essential to its\r\nsafety. But they will create a storm that will sweep either you or\r\nMcClellan from public life, and it is more than probable that you will\r\nbe the victim.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler said: \"I did not ask your opinion of the consequences, but\r\nof my duty.\"\r\n\r\nTo this it was replied: \"The speech ought to be made, and no one else\r\nwill make it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler simply said: \"It will be made to-day; come and hear it.\"\r\nAnd he did make it, in the midst of a running discussion on a bill \"to\r\nprovide for the discharge of state prisoners and others,\" which was the\r\nspecial order in the Senate for that day (July 16, 1862).\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler commenced by briefly reciting the history of the\r\nappointment of the committee, and then gave from the evidence taken at\r\nits sessions a compact summary of the causes of the Bull Run disaster,\r\nfortifying each point with citations from the testimony. After closing\r\nthis part of his speech he proceeded to review the Ball's Bluff\r\ncatastrophe, saying:\r\n\r\n  Were the people discouraged, depressed? Not at all. Untold\r\n  thousands rushed into the shattered ranks, eager to wipe out\r\n  the stain and stigma of that defeat (Bull Run). From the East,\r\n  the West, the North, and the Middle States, thousands and tens\r\n  of thousands and hundreds of thousands came pouring in, until\r\n  the government said, \"Hold, enough.\" The Army of the Potomac,\r\n  denuded in August of three-months' men and scarcely numbering\r\n  50,000 efficient men, swelled in September to over 100,000, in\r\n  October to 150,000, in November to 175,000 and upward, until,\r\n  on the 10th day of December, the morning rolls showed 195,400\r\n  men, and thirteen regiments not reported, chiefly intended for\r\n  the Burnside expedition, but all under the command of General\r\n  McClellan. During the months of October, November, and December,\r\n  the weather was delightful and the roads fine. The question began\r\n  to be asked in October, when will the advance take place? All had\r\n  the most unbounded confidence in the army and its young general,\r\n  and were anxiously waiting for a Napoleonic stroke. It came, but\r\n  such a stroke! That a general movement was being prepared the\r\n  whole country had known for weeks; but when the terrific blow was\r\n  to be struck no one knew save the commander of the Army of the\r\n  Potomac. The nation believed in its young commander; the President\r\n  relied upon him, and all, myself included, had the most unbounded\r\n  confidence in the result of the intended movement. It came! On the\r\n  21st of October, McCall's division, 12,000 strong, was ordered\r\n  to Drainesville upon a reconnoissance. Smith's division, 12,000\r\n  strong, was ordered to support him. McCall's reconnoissance\r\n  extended four miles beyond Drainesville, and to within nine miles\r\n  of Leesburg. Stone, on Sunday, was informed of McCall's and Smith's\r\n  advance, and directed to make a slight demonstration upon Leesburg.\r\n  How? He could do it in but one way, and that was by crossing the\r\n  river and moving upon it. [Mr. Chandler here introduced a mass of\r\n  testimony and official orders to show that Col. E. D. Baker, whom\r\n  General Stone sent across the Potomac at Ball's Bluff, had ample\r\n  reasons to believe that he would be sustained in that advance,\r\n  and reinforced if necessary. He proceeded:] Thus it is shown that\r\n  Colonel Baker had reason to expect reinforcements, for the enemy\r\n  were to be pushed upon their flank by General Gorman.\r\n\r\n  At two o'clock on Monday morning Colonel Devens crossed the river\r\n  upon a reconnoissance with 400 men at Ball's Bluff, opposite\r\n  Harrison's Island, as directed by General Stone. At daylight\r\n  Colonel Baker was ordered to cross to the support of Colonel\r\n  Devens. I have read his orders. One scow and two small boats were\r\n  their only means of transportation. At eight o'clock on Monday\r\n  morning the fight commenced by Colonel Devens, and Colonel Baker\r\n  was placed in command, as is alleged, with discretionary orders.\r\n  Colonel Baker knew that Smith and McCall were at Drainesville,\r\n  or within striking distance, that our troops were crossing at\r\n  Edward's Ferry, or, in other words, that 40,000 effective men\r\n  were within twelve miles of him, and that at least 30,000 were\r\n  upon the Virginia side of the Potomac, and that, in the nature of\r\n  things, he must be reinforced. He did not know that at half-past\r\n  ten A.M., of Monday, or two and one-half hours after Colonel Devens\r\n  commenced the fight, the divisions of Smith and McCall commenced\r\n  their retreat by the express orders of General McClellan. He knew\r\n  that Colonel Devens was contending with greatly superior forces,\r\n  and, like a gallant soldier as he was, he hastened to his relief\r\n  with all the force he could cross with his inadequate means of\r\n  transportation.\r\n\r\n  Colonel Baker has been charged with imprudence and rashness; but\r\n  neither the facts nor the testimony support the charge. Instead\r\n  of rashly or imprudently advancing into the enemy's lines, as\r\n  was alleged, he did not move ten rods from the Bluff, and the\r\n  only sustaining witness to this charge was one officer, who swore\r\n  that he thought Colonel Baker imprudently exposed himself to the\r\n  enemy's bullets. This kind of rashness is usually pardoned after\r\n  the death of the perpetrator. At two o'clock P. M. Colonel Baker\r\n  found himself in command of about 1,800 men upon Ball's Bluff,\r\n  including Devens's men and three guns, and the fighting commenced.\r\n  The alternatives were fight and conquer, surrender, or be captured.\r\n  That noble band of heroes and their gallant commander understood\r\n  these terrible alternatives as well upon that bloody field as we\r\n  do now, and nobly did they vindicate their manhood. During all\r\n  those long hours, from two o'clock P. M. until the early dusk of\r\n  evening, the gallant Baker continued the unequal contest, when he\r\n  fell pierced by three bullets and instantly expired. A council\r\n  of war was called (after the frightful death-struggle over his\r\n  lifeless remains and for them), and it was decided that the only\r\n  chance of an escape was by cutting through the enemy and reaching\r\n  Edward's Ferry, which was at once decided upon; but, while\r\n  forming for the desperate encounter, the enemy rushed upon our\r\n  little band of heroes in overpowering numbers, and the rout was\r\n  perfect.... How many were killed in battle, how many drowned in\r\n  the relentless river, will never be correctly known; suffice it\r\n  to say, our little force was destroyed. Why was this little band\r\n  permitted to be destroyed by a force little more than double its\r\n  numbers in presence of 40,000 splendid troops? Why were McCall and\r\n  Smith ordered back at the very moment that Baker was ordered to\r\n  cross? If we wanted Leesburg, McCall could have taken it without\r\n  the loss of a man, as his movement in mass had already caused its\r\n  evacuation, and the enemy did not return in force until after\r\n  McCall had retreated. If we did not wish to capture Leesburg, why\r\n  did we cross at all? Of what use is \"a slight demonstration\" even,\r\n  without results? These are questions which the people will ask,\r\n  and no man can satisfactorily answer. Why were not reinforcements\r\n  sent from Edward's Ferry to Colonel Baker? The distance was only\r\n  three-and-a-half miles. We had 1,500 men across at two o'clock on\r\n  Monday, and the universal concurrent testimony of officers and men\r\n  is that a reinforcement of even 1,000 men--some say 500, and one\r\n  gallant captain swears that with 100 men he could have struck them\r\n  upon the flank,--would have changed the result of the day. Why were\r\n  not reinforcements sent? Stone swears, as I have already shown,\r\n  that there were batteries between Edward's Ferry and Ball's Bluff\r\n  which would have utterly destroyed any force he could have sent to\r\n  Baker's relief, and that Baker knew it. But Stone was not sustained\r\n  by a single witness; on the contrary, all swear that there were\r\n  not, to their knowledge, and that they did not believe there were\r\n  any, and a civilian living upon the spot, and in the habit of\r\n  passing over the ground frequently, swears there were none; and\r\n  again, Stone, when questioned as to the erection of forts under the\r\n  range of his guns upon his second examination, swears positively\r\n  that there is not a gun now between Edward's Ferry and Ball's\r\n  Bluff, and never has been. Why, then, were not reinforcements sent\r\n  from Edward's Ferry? Let the men who executed and planned this\r\n  horrible slaughter answer to God and an outraged country. General\r\n  Banks swears that his orders were such from General McClellan,\r\n  that, upon his arrival at Edward's Ferry, although his judgment was\r\n  against crossing, he did not feel himself at liberty to decline\r\n  crossing, and he remained upon the Virginia side until Thursday....\r\n  So much for the wholesale murder at Ball's Bluff.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler next attacked General McClellan's disastrous\r\nprocrastination. Describing the lapse of an army of 150,000 men into\r\na state of chronic inaction in its intrenchments about Washington\r\nafter the Ball's Bluff disaster, he laid before the Senate and the\r\ncountry documents which proved these facts: In October, 1861, the Navy\r\nDepartment requested that 4,000 men might be detailed to hold Matthias\r\nPoint on the lower Potomac, after the gunboats should have shelled\r\nout the rebels, who were then in possession, and thus in control of\r\nthe navigation of that important river. General McClellan agreed to\r\nfurnish the infantry; twice the Navy Department prepared its vessels\r\nfor the expedition, but the troops did not report for duty, so that,\r\nfinally, the gunboats were necessarily detailed for other service, and\r\nthe unnecessary, expensive and humiliating blockade of the Potomac\r\ncontinued for months. Mr. Chandler then proceeded:\r\n\r\n  Why was this disgrace so long submitted to? No man knows or\r\n  attempts to explain. Month after month one of the most splendid\r\n  armies the world had ever seen, of 200,000 men, permitted itself\r\n  and the national capital to be besieged by a force _never_\r\n  exceeding one-half its own number.\r\n\r\n  During the month of December, the nation became impatient. The\r\n  time had arrived and passed when we were promised a forward\r\n  movement. The roads were good, the weather splendid, the army\r\n  in high condition, and eager for the fray. How long the roads\r\n  and weather would permit the movement, no man could predict;\r\n  still there was no movement. The generals, with great unanimity,\r\n  declared that the army had reached its maximum of proficiency\r\n  as volunteers, but still there was no movement. Under these\r\n  circumstances, the Committee on the Conduct of the War asked an\r\n  interview with the President and Cabinet, and urged that the winter\r\n  should not be permitted to pass without action, as it would lead\r\n  to an incalculable loss of life and treasure by forcing our brave\r\n  troops into a summer campaign, in a hot and to them inhospitable\r\n  climate. The President and Cabinet were united in the desire that\r\n  an immediate advance should be made, but it was not made, although\r\n  we were assured by General McClellan that it would be very soon,\r\n  that he had no intention of going into winter quarters, and he did\r\n  not! While the enemy erected comfortable huts at Centreville and\r\n  Manassas for their winter quarters, our brave and eager troops\r\n  spent the most uncomfortable winter ever known in this climate\r\n  under canvas, as thousands and tens of thousands of invalid\r\n  soldiers throughout the length and breadth of the land will attest.\r\n  Why did not the army move in all December, or why did it not go\r\n  into winter quarters? No man knows, nor is any reason assigned.\r\n\r\n  On the 1st day of January, 1862, and for months previous to that\r\n  date, the armies of the republic were occupying a purely defensive\r\n  position upon the whole line from Missouri to the Atlantic, until\r\n  on or about the 27th of January the President and Secretary of War\r\n  issued the order forward. Then the brave Foote took the initiative,\r\n  soliciting 2,000 men from Halleck to hold Fort Henry after he had\r\n  captured it with his gunboats. They were promptly furnished, and\r\n  Henry fell; then Donelson, with its 15,000 prisoners; then Newbern,\r\n  and the country was electrified. Credit was given where credit was\r\n  due. Do-nothing strategy gave way to an \"immediate advance upon\r\n  the enemy's works,\" and the days of spades and pickaxes seemed\r\n  to be ended. On the 22d of February a forward movement upon our\r\n  whole line was ordered, but did not take place. The Army of the\r\n  Potomac was not ready; but on the 10th of March it moved, against\r\n  the protest of the commanding general and eight out of twelve of\r\n  the commanders of divisions; but the President was inexorable, and\r\n  the movement must be made. It proceeded to Centreville, and there\r\n  found deserted huts, wooden artillery, and intrenchments which\r\n  could and can be successfully charged by cavalry. It proceeded\r\n  to Manassas, and found no fortifications worthy of the name,\r\n  a deserted, abandoned camp, and dead horses for trophies. The\r\n  enemy, less than 40,000 men, had leisurely escaped, carrying away\r\n  all their artillery, baggage, arms, and stores. Our Army of the\r\n  Potomac, on that 10th day of March, showed by its muster-roll a\r\n  force of 230,000 men. Comment is needless! The Grand Army of the\r\n  Potomac proceeded toward Gordonsville, found no enemy, repaired the\r\n  railroad, and then marched back again.\r\n\r\n  Why this Grand Army of the Potomac did not march upon Richmond has\r\n  never been satisfactorily explained, and probably never will be.\r\n  One reason assigned was lack of transportation; but there were two\r\n  railroads, one by way of Acquia Creek and Fredericksburg, the\r\n  other via Manassas and Gordonsville, which could have been repaired\r\n  at the rate of ten miles per day, and our army was ample to guard\r\n  it. Had this overwhelming force proceeded directly to Richmond by\r\n  these lines, it would have spent the 1st day of May in Richmond,\r\n  and ere this the rebellion would have been ended. This grand army,\r\n  _ably_ commanded, was superior to any army the world has seen for\r\n  five hundred years. Napoleon I. never fought 130,000 men upon\r\n  one battle-field. Yet this noble army was divided and virtually\r\n  sacrificed by some one. Who is the culprit?\r\n\r\n  Before the advance upon Manassas, General McClellan changed his\r\n  plans, and demanded to be permitted to leave the enemy intrenched\r\n  at Centreville and Manassas; to leave the Potomac blockaded, and\r\n  to take his army to Annapolis by land, and there embark them for\r\n  the rear of the enemy to surprise him. In the council of war\r\n  called upon this proposition, the commanding general and eight out\r\n  of twelve of the commanders of divisions (and here permit me to\r\n  say that I am informed that seven out of the eight generals were\r\n  appointed upon the recommendation of General McClellan) voted that\r\n  it was not safe to advance upon the wooden guns of Centreville, and\r\n  to adopt the new plan of campaign. The President and the Secretary\r\n  of War overruled this pusillanimous decision, and compelled\r\n  McClellan to \"move immediately upon the enemy's works.\" He marched,\r\n  and the trophies of that memorable campaign are known to the Senate\r\n  and the country.\r\n\r\n  At Fairfax, General McClellan changed his plan and decided not to\r\n  advance upon the rebels with his whole force, but to return to\r\n  Alexandria, divide his army, and embark for Fortress Monroe and\r\n  Yorktown. It was decided that 45,000 men should be left for the\r\n  defense of the capital, and he was permitted to embark. After much\r\n  delay (unavoidable in the movement of so vast a force, with its\r\n  enormous material) the general-in-chief himself embarked. Soon\r\n  after he sailed it came to the knowledge of the Committee on the\r\n  Conduct of the War that the capital, with its vast accumulation\r\n  of material of war, had been left by General McClellan virtually\r\n  without defense, and the enemy's whole force, large or small, was\r\n  untouched in front. [Mr. Chandler here introduced the official\r\n  testimony to prove that General McClellan had so denuded Washington\r\n  as to compel the President to interpose and detain General\r\n  McDowell's corps for its adequate defense. He then said:] The\r\n  country has been deceived. It has been led to believe that the\r\n  Secretary of War or somebody else has interfered with General\r\n  McClellan's plans, when he had an army that could have crushed any\r\n  other army on the face of the earth. One hundred and fifty-eight\r\n  thousand of the best troops that ever stood on God's footstool were\r\n  sent down to the Peninsula and placed under command of General\r\n  McClellan; and yet the whole treasonable press of the country has\r\n  been howling after the Secretary of War because of his alleged\r\n  refusal to send reinforcements to General McClellan. As I said the\r\n  other day, he has sent every man, every sabre, every bayonet, every\r\n  horse, that could be spared from any source whatever to increase\r\n  that grand army under General McClellan in front of Richmond. Why\r\n  did he not enter Richmond? We shall see.... It is not for me, sir,\r\n  to state the strength of McClellan's army at this time; but I know\r\n  it is 158,000 men, less the number lost by sickness and casualties.\r\n  Does any man doubt that this army, ably handled, was sufficiently\r\n  strong to have captured Richmond and crushed the rebel army? I\r\n  think not, if promptly led against the enemy; but instead of that,\r\n  it sat down in malarious swamps and awaited the drafting, arming,\r\n  drilling, and making soldiers of an army to fight it, and in the\r\n  meantime our own army was rapidly wasting away. Unwholesome water,\r\n  inadequate food, overwork, and sleeping in marshes, were rapidly\r\n  filling the hospitals, and overloading the return boats with the\r\n  sick. Sir, we have lost more men by the spade than the bullet,\r\n  five to one, since the army started from Yorktown under McClellan.\r\n  Had the soldiers been relieved from digging and menial labor by\r\n  the substitution of negro laborers, the Army of the Potomac would\r\n  to-day, in my estimation, contain 30,000 more brave and efficient\r\n  soldiers than it does. Had it been relieved from guarding the\r\n  property of rebels in arms, many valuable lives would have been\r\n  saved. Yorktown was evacuated after a sacrifice of more men by\r\n  sickness than the enemy had in their works when our army landed at\r\n  Fortress Monroe. The battle of Williamsburg was fought by a small\r\n  fraction of our army, and the enemy routed. During the battle,\r\n  General McClellan wrote a dispatch, miles from the field of battle,\r\n  saying he should try to \"hold them in check\" there.... He would try\r\n  to \"hold them in check!\" He could not hold them. He could not stop\r\n  his eager troops from chasing them. After a small fraction of his\r\n  army had whipped their entire force and had been chasing them for\r\n  hours, he penned that dispatch and sent it to the Secretary of War,\r\n  and, if I remember aright, it was read in one of the two houses of\r\n  Congress. As you may suppose from that dispatch, there was no great\r\n  eagerness in following up that victory. Three Michigan regiments\r\n  were not only decimated, they were divided in twain, in that\r\n  bloody battle at Williamsburg. They fought there all day without\r\n  reinforcements. One Michigan regiment went into the trenches and\r\n  left sixty-three dead rebels, killed by the bayonet, weltering in\r\n  their blood. But who has ever heard, by any official communication\r\n  from the head of the army, that a Michigan regiment was in the\r\n  fight at Williamsburg? I do not blame him for not giving credit\r\n  where credit is due, for I do not believe he knew anything more of\r\n  that fight than you or I.\r\n\r\n  When that battle was fought and won, all the enemy's works were\r\n  cleared away, and we had an open road to Richmond. There was not a\r\n  single fortification between Richmond and Williamsburg. All we had\r\n  to do was to get through those infernal swamps, march up, and take\r\n  possession of Richmond. What did we do? We found the worst swamp\r\n  there was between Richmond and Williamsburg, and sat right down\r\n  in the center of it and went to digging. We sacrificed thousands\r\n  and tens of thousands of the bravest troops that ever stood on\r\n  the face of God's earth, digging in front of no intrenchments, and\r\n  before a whipped army of the enemy. We waited for them to recruit;\r\n  we waited for them to get another army. They had a levy _en masse_.\r\n  They were taking all the men and boys between the ages of fifteen\r\n  and fifty-five, and magnanimously we waited weeks and weeks and\r\n  weeks for them to bring these forced levies into some sort of\r\n  consistency as an army. The battle of Fair Oaks was fought. There\r\n  the enemy found again a little fraction of our army, very much\r\n  less than half, and they brought out their entire force. I have it\r\n  from the best authority that they had not a solitary regiment in\r\n  or about Richmond that was fit to put in front of an enemy that\r\n  they did not bring to Fair Oaks and hurl upon our decimated army.\r\n  Again the indomitable bravery of our troops (of the men, of private\r\n  soldiers, the indomitable energy of Michigan men and New Jersey\r\n  men--but I will not particularize, for all the troops fought like\r\n  lions), and the fighting capacity of our army not only saved it\r\n  from being utterly destroyed by an overwhelming force, but gave us\r\n  a triumphant victory. The enemy went back to Richmond pell-mell.\r\n  I have been informed by a man who was there at the time, that two\r\n  brigades of fresh troops could have chased the whole Confederate\r\n  army through the city of Richmond and into the James river, so\r\n  utter was their rout and confusion.\r\n\r\n  And what did we do then? We found another big swamp, and we sat\r\n  down in the center of it and went to digging. We began to throw up\r\n  intrenchments when there were no intrenchments in our front, no\r\n  enemy that was not utterly broken. We never took advantage of the\r\n  battle of Fair Oaks. Again Michigan soldiers were cut to pieces\r\n  by hundreds. Go into the Judiciary square hospital in this city,\r\n  and you will find more than half the occupants are Michigan men\r\n  who were shot at Fair Oaks and Williamsburg, men who stood until\r\n  a regiment of 1,000 men was reduced to 105, and even then did not\r\n  run. Sir, these men have been sacrificed, uselessly sacrificed.\r\n  They have been put to hard digging, and hard fare, and hard\r\n  sleeping, and if there was any hard fighting to do they have been\r\n  put to that; and, besides all this, at night they have had to guard\r\n  the property of rebels in arms. They have been so sacrificed that\r\n  two or three of the Michigan regiments to-day cannot bring into the\r\n  field 250 men each out of 1,000 with whom they started.\r\n\r\n  Fair Oaks was lost; that is to say, we won a brilliant victory,\r\n  but it did us no good; we did not take advantage of it. Of course\r\n  it would have been very unfair to take advantage of a routed army\r\n  [laughter]; it would not have been according to our \"strategy.\" We\r\n  magnanimously stopped, and commenced digging. There was no army in\r\n  our front, there were no intrenchments in our front; but we did not\r\n  know what else to do, and so we began to dig and ditch, and we kept\r\n  digging and ditching until the rebels had impressed and drilled and\r\n  armed and made soldiers of their entire population. But that was\r\n  not enough; they sent Jackson up on his raid to Winchester, and\r\n  we waited for him to come back with his twenty or thirty thousand\r\n  men. We heard that Corinth was being evacuated, and of course\r\n  it would have been very unfair to commence an attack until they\r\n  brought their troops from Corinth, and so we waited for the army at\r\n  Corinth to get to Richmond. After the rebels had got all the troops\r\n  they ever hoped to raise from any source, we did not attack them,\r\n  but they attacked us, as we had reason to suppose they would. They\r\n  attacked our right wing, and, as I am informed upon what I must\r\n  deem reliable authority, they hurled the majority of their entire\r\n  force upon our right wing of 30,000 men, and during the whole of\r\n  that Thursday our right wing of 30,000 men held their ground, and\r\n  repulsed that vast horde of the enemy over and over again, and held\r\n  their ground at night. Of course you will say a reinforcement of\r\n  twenty or thirty thousand men was sent to these brave troops that\r\n  they might not only hold their ground the next day, but send this\r\n  dastardly army into Richmond a second time, as at Fair Oaks. No,\r\n  sir, nothing of the sort was done.\r\n\r\n  At night, instead of sending them reinforcements, they were ordered\r\n  to retreat. That was \"strategy!\" The moment they commenced their\r\n  retreat, as is said in the dispatches, the enemy fought like\r\n  demons. Of course they would. Who ever heard of a retreating army\r\n  that was not pursued by the victors like demons, except in the\r\n  case of rebel retreats? No other nation but ours was ever guilty\r\n  of stopping immediately after a victory. Other armies fight like\r\n  demons after a victory, and annihilate the enemy, but we do not.\r\n  Our left wing and center remained intact. A feint was made upon\r\n  the left and center, and I have here, not the sworn testimony, but\r\n  the statement of one of the bravest men in the whole Army of the\r\n  Potomac--I will not give his name, but a more highly honorable man\r\n  lives not--that when his regiment was ordered under arms, he had\r\n  no doubt that he was going to march into Richmond. He believed the\r\n  whole force of the enemy had attacked our right wing; he believed\r\n  there was nothing but a screen of pickets in front; and he thought\r\n  that now our great triumph was to come off. His men sprang into\r\n  line with avidity, prepared to rush into Richmond and take it at\r\n  the point of the bayonet. He never discovered his error until he\r\n  saw a million and a half dollars' worth of property burned in\r\n  front of his regiment, and then he began to think that an advance\r\n  upon Richmond was not intended. And it was not! We had been at\r\n  work there and had lost 10,000 men in digging intrenchments; we\r\n  had spent months in bringing up siege guns, and we abandoned\r\n  those intrenchments without firing one gun. Our army was ordered\r\n  to advance on the gunboats instead of on Richmond. This colonel\r\n  told me that his regiment fought three days and whipped the enemy\r\n  each day, and retreated each night. The left wing and center were\r\n  untouched until they were ordered to retreat. No portion of our\r\n  vast force had been fought except the right wing under Porter, and\r\n  they whipped the enemy the first day.\r\n\r\n  This is called strategy! Again, sir, I ask, Why was this great\r\n  Army of the Potomac of 230,000 men divided? Human ingenuity could\r\n  not have devised any other way to defeat that army; Divine wisdom\r\n  could scarcely have devised any other way to defeat it than that\r\n  which was adopted. There is no army in Europe to-day that could\r\n  meet the Army of the Potomac when it was 230,000 strong, the best\r\n  fighting material ever put into an army on the face of the earth.\r\n  Why was that grand army divided? I simply charge that grave and\r\n  serious errors have been committed, and, as I have said, no other\r\n  way could have been devised to defeat that army. If the 158,000\r\n  men that were sent to General McClellan had been marched upon the\r\n  enemy, they could have whipped all the armies the Confederates\r\n  have, and all they are likely to have for six months. One hundred\r\n  and fifty-eight thousand men are about as many as can be fought on\r\n  any one battle-field. One hundred and fifty-eight thousand men are\r\n  a vast army, a great deal larger army than that with which Napoleon\r\n  destroyed 600,000 of the Austrians in a single year. One hundred\r\n  and fifty-eight thousand men ably handled can defeat any force\r\n  the Confederates can raise; and that is the force that went down\r\n  to the Peninsula. But, sir, it lay in ditches, digging, drinking\r\n  rotten water, and eating bad food, and sleeping in the mud, until\r\n  it became greatly reduced in numbers, and of those that were left\r\n  very many were injured in health. Still they fought; still they\r\n  conquered in every fight, and still they retreated, because they\r\n  were ordered to retreat.\r\n\r\n  Sir, I have deemed it my duty to present this statement of facts to\r\n  the Senate and the country. I know that I am to be denounced for so\r\n  doing, and I tell you who will denounce me. There are two classes\r\n  of men who are sure to denounce me, and no one else, and they are\r\n  traitors and fools. The traitors have been denouncing every man who\r\n  did not sing pæans to \"strategy,\" when it led to defeat every time.\r\n  The traitors North are worse than the traitors South, and sometimes\r\n  I think we have as many of them in the aggregate. They are meaner\r\n  men; they are men who will come behind you and cut your throat in\r\n  the dark. I have great respect for Southern traitors who shoulder\r\n  their muskets and come out and take the chances of the bullets\r\n  and the halter; but I have the most superlative contempt for the\r\n  Northern traitors, who, under the pretended guise of patriotism,\r\n  are stabbing their country in the dark.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this speech was profound. It enraged McClellan's friends\r\nto the highest pitch; it was not supported at the time by any like\r\nutterance in Congress, and at first many who believed it to be true\r\ncondemned, or at least deprecated, the fierceness of the attack;\r\nbut those who knew that \"the young Napoleon\" at heart preferred a\r\npro-slavery compromise to the conquest of a durable and honorable\r\npeace, and who had marked with righteous indignation the attempt of\r\nhis _claquers_ to make the Secretary of War the scape-goat for his\r\nown blunders, greeted with enthusiasm the signal courage of the man\r\nwho, in the face of abuse, prejudice, and popular blindness, dared to\r\ntell with words of rugged force this story of disastrous imbecility.\r\nMr. Chandler disregarded the remonstrances of weak friends, and met\r\nwithout quailing the storm of vituperation he had invited. Events\r\nmade themselves his justifiers and within four months[24] President\r\nLincoln, with the full approval of the patriotic masses of the North,\r\nrelieved General McClellan from all command and abruptly terminated\r\nhis military career. Nothing contributed more to this salutary change\r\nthan Mr. Chandler's arraignment, of which it has been well said, that\r\n\"with words resembling battles he told the American people that they\r\nwere leaning upon a broken reed, that 'the idol of the soldiers' was\r\nas incapable of helping them as the idols of the heathen, and that\r\nMcClellan was only digging graves for the brave men who followed him\r\nand a last ditch for the cause he defended; he shocked by his language\r\nthe mass of the people into a right comprehension of the death's dance\r\nthis military Jack-o'-lantern was leading them through the swamps of\r\nVirginia.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler, who took this step after full deliberation and not\r\nfrom any passing impulse, rated the McClellan speech as his most\r\nimportant public service, alike in its necessity, its timeliness,\r\nand its results. He also felt that it involved more real hazard,\r\nand made larger demands upon his courage, than any other act of his\r\nSenatorial career, for such relentless invective could scarcely fail\r\nto mortally wound either its object or its maker. Had time shown that\r\nhe had uttered calumnies and not the sober truth, he would have been\r\ninevitably driven from public life; and even when he spoke, the men who\r\nthoroughly doubted McClellan were still a small minority. History has\r\nshown that his indictment was as true in substance as it was unsparing\r\nin terms and bold in spirit.\r\n\r\nTwo other matters naturally group themselves with this speech: Mr.\r\nChandler distrusted McClellanism in the Army of the Potomac as\r\nthoroughly as he did McClellan. The investigations of this committee\r\nconvinced him that General Pope's campaign was so unfortunate because\r\nof the insubordination of General McClellan's friends among the corps\r\ncommanders, and led him to believe that the same cause crippled the\r\nmovements of both Burnside and Hooker, who, if faithfully supported,\r\nwould have won decisive victories. So strong were his convictions on\r\nthese points, that when General Grant became commander-in-chief he\r\ncalled upon the Secretary of War and requested him to make out a list\r\nof the incompetent, suspected and insubordinate generals of the Army of\r\nthe Potomac, to be furnished to that officer so that he would be able\r\nto place them where they could do the least harm in the service. This\r\nSecretary Stanton promised to do. A few days afterward Mr. Chandler\r\ncalled again at the War Department, and, learning that this had not\r\nyet been done, said, \"I will make out the list myself and send it to\r\nGrant;\" and he did so, Major-Gen. C. C. Washburn being its bearer.\r\nMr. Chandler carefully studied and vigilantly watched the Fitz-John\r\nPorter case, and approved of the findings of the court-martial, except\r\nthe failure to inflict the death penalty, which he believed that the\r\ncharacter and consequences of Porter's action fully merited. The\r\nattempt to secure the reversal of this verdict and the re-instatement\r\nin the army of the dismissed officer aroused his sternest indignation,\r\nand he fought it resolutely at every stage--and successfully, while\r\nhe remained in the Senate. He spoke at length on this subject in that\r\nbody on Feb. 21, 1870, declaring that he did so in fulfillment of a\r\nvoluntary pledge given some years before in the same chamber to General\r\nPope, \"that justice should be done to him and to his campaign in the\r\nvalley of Virginia, even although I were called upon to vindicate him\r\nfrom my seat in the Senate.\" After rehearsing the facts connected with\r\nPope's movement, which was planned to create a diversion of Lee's\r\narmy for the extrication of McClellan's forces from the Peninsula, in\r\nconformity with the suggestion of Gen. James S. Wadsworth, and showing\r\nthat Pope had frequently requested to be relieved from the hazardous\r\nwork laid out for him and that he had only a force of 42,000 men\r\nscattered between Harper's Ferry and Acquia Creek, Mr. Chandler said:\r\n\r\n  I asked him in the presence of the committee: \"What is to prevent\r\n  you from being struck by a superior force of the enemy and\r\n  overwhelmed?\" Said he: \"Nothing on earth is more probable than\r\n  that I shall be struck by a superior force and shall be whipped;\r\n  but I will keep my troops near the mountains, and there are no\r\n  ten miles where there is not a gulch up which I can take my men\r\n  and small-arms, and, by abandoning my artillery and baggage,\r\n  save my men; I shall probably be whipped, but it must be done.\"\r\n  Any military man can see and appreciate the difficulties and\r\n  responsibilities of so desperate a campaign. \"Yet,\" said he, \"it\r\n  must be done.\"\r\n\r\n  Well, sir, General Pope started on that campaign. Had he announced\r\n  to the newspaper press of Washington, or of the North, the number\r\n  of his men or his object, the object itself would have been\r\n  defeated. General Pope did what I believe is allowable in war: he\r\n  perpetrated a _ruse de guerre_. He sent his scouts all through the\r\n  mountains of Virginia proclaiming that he had an army of 120,000\r\n  men. And, sir, he fooled the newspaper correspondents of the city\r\n  of Washington and of the whole North. General Pope, when he started\r\n  on that campaign, had no more idea of going to Richmond than he had\r\n  of following Elijah to Heaven in a chariot of fire without seeing\r\n  death. He started with one single object, and that was to save the\r\n  army of McClellan, or to do all that was in his power to save it.\r\n  He massed his troops, and that terrible battle of Cedar Mountain\r\n  was fought; and by that battle he not only fooled the people of\r\n  this country, but he fooled the rebels. The rebels believed that\r\n  he had 120,000 men, and that, unless they fought him and crushed\r\n  him before he could unite with the Army of the Potomac, their cause\r\n  was lost; and he drew upon his shoulders with that little force the\r\n  whole rebel army, so that, when McClellan started for Yorktown,\r\n  there was not even a popgun fired at his troops. The _ruse_ was\r\n  a perfect success, and, as I told General Pope then, \"I consider\r\n  that your campaign has been one of the most brilliant that has been\r\n  fought up to this time\"--which was February, 1863--\"you saved two\r\n  armies; you first saved the Army of the Potomac, and then you saved\r\n  your own.\"\r\n\r\n  Sir, General Pope fought for eleven days, fought night and day,\r\n  fought the whole rebel army with his little force, his force never\r\n  having exceeded 70,000 men,--comprising not simply his own army,\r\n  but also General Burnside's forces, and the 20,000 men who had in\r\n  thirty days been brought up from the Army of the Potomac, and of\r\n  whom Porter's corps was part. The force which he had met with these\r\n  was that originally in his front, but overwhelmingly augmented by\r\n  that rebel force from which McClellan, with his 90,000 men, had to\r\n  be delivered by a demonstration in their rear. He fought for time.\r\n  He defended every brook, every barn, every piece of woods, every\r\n  ravine. He fought for time for the Army of the Potomac to reach him\r\n  and unite with him, so as to crush the advancing and overwhelming\r\n  force of the rebels.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler then reviewed at length (and with copious citations from\r\nthe testimony of eye-witnesses and the official orders) the facts as\r\nto Fitz-John Porter's course in Pope's campaign, adding extracts from\r\nthe reports of rebel officers which had come into the possession of the\r\ngovernment since the war, and closed as follows:\r\n\r\n  Mr. President, if I had more time I should like to go more fully\r\n  into this subject; but I cannot. The court, after forty-five days\r\n  spent in careful investigation, brought in unanimously the verdict\r\n  against Porter. Many of the members of that court were in favor of\r\n  sentencing him to suffer death. It is rumored, and many believe,\r\n  that the only reason the death-penalty was not inflicted was the\r\n  fear that Mr. Lincoln, whose kindness of heart was so well-known,\r\n  would not execute the sentence; and, hence, they unanimously\r\n  brought in the verdict they did. It was first carefully examined\r\n  _seriatim_ by the then Secretary of War and the President. No more\r\n  just tribunal ever investigated a case, I presume to assert, than\r\n  this tribunal, and there its finding stands.\r\n\r\n  It may be asked, How came it that a misunderstanding, almost as\r\n  universal as complete, was suffered to be put upon the country?\r\n  General Pope himself says: \"The next day it (my report) was\r\n  delivered to General Halleck; but by that time influences of\r\n  questionable character, and transactions of most unquestionable\r\n  impropriety, which were well known at the time, had entirely\r\n  changed the purposes of the authorities. It is not necessary,\r\n  and, perhaps, would scarcely be in place, for me to recount these\r\n  things.\"\r\n\r\n  It is as well known to others present as to me that, during\r\n  that gloomy, eventful Sunday which succeeded the last battle on\r\n  Saturday, the 30th of August, the President and Mr. Stanton were\r\n  overrun and overcome with statements that, unless McClellan was\r\n  restored to command \"the army would not fight.\" These statements\r\n  came from men who did not mean it should fight, who could not in\r\n  the exigency of the moment be displaced. The President was able\r\n  afterward to relieve McClellan and court-martial Porter. Had he\r\n  lived, he would have seen justice to General Pope awarded also. It\r\n  remains for me, while I live, to do my portion of that duty.\r\n\r\n  There is one other point to which I wish to allude. During this\r\n  very trial--during the very pendency of the trial--Fitz-John Porter\r\n  said, in the presence of my informant, who is a man whom most of\r\n  you know, and who is to-day in the employment of Congress, and\r\n  whose word I would take as soon as I would most men's--though\r\n  I told him I would not use his name, but I will give his sworn\r\n  testimony, taken down within two minutes after the utterance was\r\n  made--Fitz-John Porter said in his presence: \"I was not true to\r\n  Pope, and there is no use in denying it.\" Mr. President, what was\r\n  \"not true to Pope\"? If he was not true to Pope, whom was he true\r\n  to? Being true to Pope was being true to the country; \"not true\r\n  to Pope\" was being a traitor to the country. Sir, \"not true to\r\n  Pope\" meant the terrible fight of the 30th of August, with all the\r\n  blood and all the horrors of that bitter day; \"not true to Pope\"\r\n  meant the battle of Antietam, with its thousands of slain and its\r\n  other thousands maimed; \"not true to Pope\" meant the first battle\r\n  of Fredericksburg, with its 20,000 slain and maimed; \"not true\r\n  to Pope\" covered the battles of the Wilderness and Cold Harbor,\r\n  and all the dreadful battles that followed. Had Fitz-John Porter\r\n  been true to his government, Jackson would have been destroyed\r\n  on the 29th of August, and on the 30th the rebels could scarcely\r\n  have offered any resistance to our victorious army. \"Not true to\r\n  Pope\" meant 300,000 slain and 2,000,000,000 of additional dollars\r\n  expended.\r\n\r\n  Sir, I wish to put this on the record for all time, that it may\r\n  remain. Let Fitz-John Porter thank God that he yet lives, and that\r\n  he was not living at that time under a military government. I told\r\n  General Pope, in the first interview I had with him, that I had but\r\n  one fault to find in the whole conduct of the campaign. He asked,\r\n  \"What is that?\" Said I, \"That you ever allowed Fitz-John Porter to\r\n  leave the battle-field alive!\"\r\n\r\nIn 1877 Porter at last succeeded, by the most persistent effort, in\r\nobtaining the order for the re-examination of his case, and when Mr.\r\nChandler re-entered the Senate in 1879, he found himself confronting\r\nan organized movement to secure that officer's restoration to his\r\nold rank with full pay since the date of his dishonorable dismissal\r\nfrom the army. To this contemplated action he proposed to offer the\r\nmost strenuous resistance, and the last volumes he drew from the\r\nCongressional Library were authorities he wished to consult in the\r\npreparation of his argument against the reversal of the Porter finding.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler's positive opinions in the McClellan and Porter cases were\r\nshared by his colleagues of the Committee on the Conduct of the War\r\nof the Thirty-seventh Congress, and are justified by their elaborate\r\nreports covering the history of the Army of the Potomac from the\r\nbattle of Ball's Bluff to the close of the Fredericksburg campaign.\r\nThe Thirty-eighth Senate adopted a resolution continuing the existence\r\nof this committee, and, the House concurring, the old members, so\r\nfar as they were in Congress, were re-appointed. Senator Harding of\r\nOregon took the place of Mr. Wright, and afterward Mr. Buckalew of\r\nPennsylvania succeeded Mr. Harding. From the House, Mr. B. F. Loan of\r\nMissouri was appointed as the successor of Mr. Covode. Wm. Blair Lord\r\nwas re-elected clerk and stenographer. This committee also devoted\r\nmuch of its time to the troubles of the Army of the Potomac. General\r\nBurnside had resigned the command because of a misunderstanding with\r\nthe President, brought about by the interference of Gens. John Cochrane\r\nand John Newton, and General Hooker was appointed in his place, with\r\nGeneral Halleck as commander-in-chief. But Halleck disliked Hooker,\r\nand forced his resignation by overruling his plans and countermanding\r\nhis orders, General Meade succeeding. The committee examined closely\r\ninto this matter, reaching the conclusion that Hooker had not been\r\nfairly dealt with, and incidentally disposing of the false statement\r\nthen current that that officer was intoxicated at the battle of\r\nChancellorsville, and was defeated from that cause. The committee\r\ncondemned Hooker's removal, and Mr. Chandler firmly believed in his\r\ncourage, patriotism and ability, and regarded him as the victim of\r\ncircumstances. These facts make it an interesting coincidence that\r\nthese two men--both bold, frank and positive in their respective\r\nspheres of public activity--should have died sudden and painless deaths\r\nwithin the same week.\r\n\r\nThe committee did not believe that the selection of General Meade\r\nfor the command of the Army of the Potomac was a fortunate one,\r\nand doubted his ability to properly control his subordinates. While\r\nthere is no reference to the matter in their report on this subject,\r\nit is a fact that they recommended the removal of General Meade from\r\ncommand, and the re-instatement of Hooker. On the 4th of March, 1864,\r\nMr. Chandler and Mr. Wade called upon the President, and told him that\r\nthey believed it to be their duty, impressed as they were with the\r\ntestimony the committee had taken, to lay a copy of it before him, and\r\nin behalf of the army and the country demand the removal of General\r\nMeade, and the appointment of some one more competent to command. The\r\nPresident asked what general they could recommend; they said that for\r\nthemselves they would be content with General Hooker, believing him to\r\nbe competent, but not being advocates of any particular officer, they\r\nwould say that if there was any one whom the President considered more\r\ncompetent, then let him be appointed. They added that \"Congress had\r\nappointed the committee to watch the conduct of the war; and unless\r\nthis state of things should be soon changed it would become their duty\r\nto make the testimony public which they had taken, with such comments\r\nas the circumstances of the case seemed to require.\" General Meade was\r\nnot removed, but General Grant was, within a week, given command as\r\ngeneral-in-chief, and assumed personal direction of the movements of\r\nthe Army of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nDuring 1864 and 1865 the committee (besides considering many minor\r\nmatters) also investigated, with care:\r\n\r\n1. The disastrous assault upon Petersburg on July 30, 1864; their\r\nreport exonerated General Burnside from the responsibility for\r\nthe repulse, and held that the disaster was attributable to the\r\ninterference with his plans of General Meade, whose course in the\r\nmatter was severely censured.\r\n\r\n2. The unsuccessful expedition of 1864 up the Red river in Louisiana,\r\nwhich the committee (Mr. Gooch dissenting) emphatically condemned.\r\n\r\n3. The first Fort Fisher expedition, the committee, in its report,\r\napproving of General Butler's course in withdrawing from the projected\r\nassault.\r\n\r\nDuring the inquiry into the Petersburg fiasco, the sub-committee were\r\nin session at General Grant's headquarters, and Mr. Chandler was his\r\nguest, renewing there an early acquaintance and laying the foundations\r\nof their future close friendship. Some incidents of their intercourse\r\nwere characteristic.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sherman had just reached Savannah, and the mystery of the\r\nobjective point of his great \"march to the sea\" had thus been solved\r\nfor the public. This memorable exploit was discussed at length between\r\nGeneral Grant and Mr. Chandler. The former said that the suggestion\r\nwas Sherman's, and so was the entire plan of the campaign. Sherman had\r\nurged it for a long time before he (Grant) would consent, but finally\r\nthe conditions were ripe, and the order was given. General Grant added\r\nthat Sherman was the only man in the army whom he would have entrusted\r\nthis campaign to, as he was especially adapted for such a command, and\r\nsaid: \"Congress ought to do something for Sherman. He deserves a great\r\ndeal more credit and honor than he has ever received.\" \"What can we do\r\nfor him?\" asked Mr. Chandler. \"Increase his rank,\" was the reply. \"We\r\nhave made you lieutenant general,\" responded Mr. Chandler, laughingly,\r\n\"and I suppose we could make him a general, and thus put him over you.\"\r\n\"Do it,\" said Grant, promptly. \"If he carries this campaign through\r\nsuccessfully, do it. I would rather serve under Sherman than any man I\r\nknow.\" General Grant also said that when he received a dispatch that\r\nThomas had attacked Hood, he felt that a great victory was already won.\r\nHe added: \"I did not have any anxiety about the result; when Thomas\r\nattacks, a victory is sure. He is a slow man, but he is the surest man\r\nI know. Once in motion, he is the hardest man to fight in this army.\r\nHe never precipitates a battle unless he is all ready, and knows his\r\npoints, and you may rest easy when he attacks, for the next news will\r\nbe the enemy's rout. When Thomas once gets in motion the rebels have\r\nnot force enough to stop him.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the final adjournment of the Thirty-eighth Congress (on March 4,\r\n1865) it continued the existence of the Committee on the Conduct of the\r\nWar for ninety days, in order to afford it time to finish its work.\r\nDuring this period it closed up some pending inquiries and prepared\r\nits final reports. Its last action was an examination into General\r\nSherman's unauthorized and unfortunate negotiations with General\r\nJohnston, which the committee disapproved and that officer's superiors\r\npromptly repudiated. The final report of the committee bears the date\r\nof the 22d of May, 1865, and its closing passages are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Your committee, at the close of the labors in which the most\r\n  of them have been engaged for nearly four years past, take\r\n  occasion to submit a few general observations in regard to their\r\n  investigations. They commenced them at a time when the government\r\n  was still engaged in organizing its first great armies, and before\r\n  any important victory had given token of its ability to crush\r\n  out the rebellion by the strong hand of physical power. They\r\n  have continued them until the rebellion has been overthrown, the\r\n  so-called Confederate government been made a thing of the past,\r\n  and the chief of that treasonable organization is a proclaimed\r\n  felon in the hands of our authorities. And soon the military and\r\n  naval forces, whose deeds have been the subjects of our inquiry,\r\n  will return to the ways of peace and the pursuits of civil life,\r\n  from which they have been called for a time by the danger which\r\n  threatened their country. Yet while we welcome those brave veterans\r\n  on their return from fields made historical by their gallant\r\n  achievements, our joy is saddened as we view their thinned ranks\r\n  and reflect that tens of thousands, as brave as they, have fallen\r\n  victims to that savage and infernal spirit which actuated those who\r\n  spared not the prisoners at their mercy, who sought by midnight\r\n  arson to destroy hundreds of defenseless women and children,\r\n  and who hesitated not to resort to means and to commit acts so\r\n  horrible that the nations of the earth stand aghast as they are\r\n  told what has been done. It is a matter for congratulation that,\r\n  notwithstanding the greatest provocations to pursue a different\r\n  course, our authorities have ever treated their prisoners humanely\r\n  and generously, and have in all respects conducted this contest\r\n  according to the rules of the most civilized warfare....\r\n\r\n  Your committee would refer to the record of their labors to show\r\n  the spirit and purpose by which they have been governed in their\r\n  investigations. They have not sought to accomplish any purpose\r\n  other than to elicit the truth; to that end have all their labors\r\n  been directed. If they have failed at any time to accomplish that\r\n  purpose, it has been from causes beyond their control. Their work\r\n  is before the people, and by it they are willing to be judged.\r\n\r\nThe volumes which contain the official record of the proceedings of the\r\nCommittee on the Conduct of the War are and always must be regarded as\r\nthe most valuable single magazine of historical material relating to\r\nthe Great Rebellion. They have been liberally used in the preparation\r\nof every important account of our civil strife yet published, and the\r\nmen, who shall in the light of another century estimate the greatness\r\nand significance of that \"throe of progress,\" will inevitably look\r\nin their pages to the graphic narratives of those who were parts\r\nof memorable movements and actors in famous battles as a means of\r\ninformation, and to the conclusions of those who prosecuted inquiries\r\nso zealously when the events were yet fresh in the memory as a source\r\nof guidance. Infallibility is not a human attribute, and the work of\r\nthis committee was not free from misapprehension and mistake. Time,\r\nwhich has shown some of its errors and will correct others, has also\r\nsustained the essential justice of its most important conclusions,\r\nwhich will stand unreversed on the pages of impartial history.\r\n\r\nBut the chief value of the labors of this committee is not to be\r\nfound in its collection of rich materials for the future chronicler.\r\nTo its unrecorded but potent influence upon the conduct of the war,\r\nadequate justice has not yet been done. Its unwearied investigations\r\nconstantly exposed corruption, incompetence, and insubordination, and\r\nplaced in the hands of the authorities the means of discovering and\r\npunishing the knavish, the weak, and the disloyal. Its activity was\r\na perpetual prompter to energy, and a vigilant detective by the side\r\nof inefficiency and disaffection. As the result of its labors, the\r\nunsuccessful, the half-hearted, and the traitorous gave way to the\r\nable and the patriotic; because of the knowledge of its relentless\r\nquestioning, indolent men were vigilant, and laxity was transformed\r\ninto vigor. Its unremitting labors stayed up the hands of the War\r\nSecretary in the heaviest hours of his great task, and usefully\r\ninformed the counsels and shaped the decisions of the White House. If\r\nits every session had been permanently secret, and not a line of its\r\nproceedings existed as a public record, there would still remain an\r\nineffaceable transcript of the results of its action in the correcting\r\nof mistakes of organization and that crushing of sham generalship which\r\nalone made final victory possible.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] In \"The Republic\" magazine of April, 1875.\r\n\r\n[23] Edwin M. Stanton had succeeded Simon Cameron on Jan. 13. 1862.\r\n\r\n[24] On Nov. 7, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE VIGOROUS PROSECUTION OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nConscription, taxation, and the reverses of the Union arms in the\r\nsummer of 1862 in Virginia and elsewhere materially affected the\r\npolitical currents of the ensuing fall, and the tide of reaction\r\nagainst the war feeling reached its highest flood in the closing\r\nelections of that year. Horatio Seymour was then chosen Governor of\r\nNew York; the States of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and\r\nIllinois gave anti-Republican majorities, and ten of the principal\r\nNorthern States, which in 1860 rolled up over 200,000 Republican\r\nmajority, gave over 35,000 to the Opposition, while the footings of\r\ntheir Congressional delegations showed a Democratic majority of ten\r\nreplacing a Republican preponderance of forty-one. In Michigan a\r\nsuccessful effort was made to fuse all the \"conservative\" elements in a\r\nso-called \"Union movement,\" which obtained some support from lukewarm\r\nRepublicans and was thus enabled to manifest unusual strength. Its\r\nplatform was dissent from \"radical\" measures in general, and the force\r\nof its attacks was centered upon Senator Chandler and his record, as\r\nrepresenting the most aggressive type of Republicanism. He accepted\r\nthis challenge unhesitatingly, and fought the campaign through without\r\na hint at retraction or an apologetic word. He defended the \"blood\r\nletter\" and the \"McClellan speech\" on every stump; he repeated before\r\nthe people the bold utterances with which he had stirred the Senate;\r\nhe declared to every audience that his record he would not qualify by\r\na hair's breadth, and that by it he was prepared to stand or fall;\r\nand he denounced with unstinted severity the weakness of some of his\r\ncritics and the disloyalty of others.[25] The brunt of the battle in\r\nhis State fell upon him, and the vigor and courage of his personal\r\ncanvass attracted widespread attention. He spoke in all the leading\r\ncities of Michigan during the campaign, and worked uninterruptedly\r\nuntil the day of election. The result was the casting of 68,716 votes\r\nfor the Republican State ticket to 62,102 for the \"Union\" candidates,\r\nand the choice of five Republicans out of the six members of Congress,\r\nand of a Legislature constituted as follows: Senate--18 Republicans\r\nand 14 Fusionists; House--63 Republicans and 37 Fusionists. This\r\nLegislature, on assembling in January, 1863, re-elected Mr. Chandler\r\nto the Senate in accordance with the unmistakable wish of his party\r\nand the universal expectation. The most strenuous efforts were made\r\nto detach Republican support from him, but they failed utterly. In\r\nthe caucus the vote was taken _viva voce_, and it was unanimous for\r\nMr. Chandler. In the Legislature he received the support of the\r\nrepresentatives of his party as well as that of one or two members\r\nchosen by the Fusionists. The Opposition selected a candidate of\r\nRepublican antecedents, and its vote was divided as follows: James F.\r\nJoy, 45; Alpheus Felch, 2; Hezekiah G. Wells, 1; Solomon L. Withey, 1.\r\nIn his address of thanks before the nominating caucus, Mr. Chandler\r\nsaid: \"I do not claim my re-election as a personal tribute. It is,\r\nrather, a tribute to principle. It indicates that the patriotic sons\r\nof Michigan stand firm in support of the government and a vigorous\r\nprosecution of the war.\"\r\n\r\nNot only did he thus modestly measure the significance of his\r\nre-election, but he bent every energy to make that felt which the\r\npeople meant. Strafford's motto of \"Thorough\"--although the spirit was\r\nthat of Hampden and Pym and not of the apostate Earl--expresses the\r\nfixity of purpose and the ardor of zeal with which he strove to make\r\nirresistible the blows of the Union against its assailants. Before the\r\npeople, on the floor of the Senate, within the White House, at the\r\nprivate offices of the War Department, in committee-room, and as part\r\nof his daily intercourse with men of all ranks and classes, he urged\r\nthe use of every resource for the defense of the nation and demanded\r\nthe sternest punishment of those who had dared\r\n\r\n            \"to lay their hand upon the ark\r\n    \"Of her magnificent and awful cause.\"\r\n\r\nAs a Senator his vote was recorded for every important war measure,\r\nrelating to the revenues, the finances, and the armies of the Union.\r\nUpon the great questions of public policy which bore so powerfully\r\non the progress of the struggle he uniformly led his party. At the\r\nfirst Congressional session of the war he urged the employment of\r\nconfiscation as a legitimate and effective weapon for checking and\r\npunishing rebellion; the measure he introduced at that time proved to\r\nbe too sweeping to receive an immediate enactment, but within a few\r\nmonths Congress did advance on this subject to his ground. When General\r\nButler declared that the slaves who fled to his camp from work upon\r\nthe rebel intrenchments were \"contraband of war,\" and reported his\r\naction to the authorities at Washington and asked for instructions, Mr.\r\nChandler was one of the first to appreciate the adroit wisdom of that\r\nepigrammatic construction of military law, and his co-operation with\r\nSecretary Cameron in urging the approval of General Butler's action\r\nupon the President and General Scott was very valuable and effective.\r\nImmediately after the battle of Bull Run he, with Mr. Sumner and\r\nMr. Hamlin, called upon Mr. Lincoln with a proposition to organize\r\nand arm the colored people. Mr. Chandler even then favored the full\r\nexercise of the President's constitutional war powers, and urged that\r\nthey should be used, first, to set the slaves free; and, second, to\r\nmake the slaves themselves aid the work of abolishing slavery and\r\nmaintaining the Union. He believed that this institution was the\r\nbackbone of the South, that the war was brought on to save it from the\r\ncivilizing tendencies of the age, and that among the first steps taken\r\nby the Federal government, when thus assailed by slavery, should be\r\nthe proclaiming of freedom to all bondsmen and the guaranteeing of the\r\nprotection of the government to the free. He argued that such a policy,\r\npromptly declared, would produce chaos in the South, would subject the\r\nConfederate government to the danger of local uprisings of the negroes,\r\nand would thus make victory easy. But the Administration was not\r\nprepared to take a step so far in advance of popular opinion, and for\r\nsome months the prevailing policy was one which prohibited the soldiers\r\nof the Union from protecting or harboring fugitive slaves, and in some\r\ninstances made slave-hunters of the troops. When General Fremont, on\r\nthe 31st of August, issued his proclamation in Missouri, declaring\r\nfree all slaves belonging to persons engaged in the rebellion, Mr.\r\nChandler was among those who most heartily approved this step. The\r\nPresident was alarmed, as he feared the country was not ready for such\r\nan act, and greatly modified the Fremont proclamation, as he also did a\r\nstill more sweeping order of General Hunter in the following May. Mr.\r\nChandler's disappointment at this was extreme, but within a few months\r\nhe saw emancipation resorted to by the Administration as a war measure,\r\nand a death-blow dealt to \"the relic of barbarism.\" That part of the\r\nreport for 1861 of Simon Cameron as Secretary of War, which urged the\r\nmost summary attacks upon the institution of slavery as the surest\r\nmeans of dealing mortal blows to the rebellion, and which Mr. Lincoln\r\nsuppressed, Mr. Chandler heartily endorsed, and every manifestation by\r\nNorthern commanders of a disposition to make their armies defenders\r\nof the slave system aroused his indignation. The act of March 13,\r\n1862, prohibiting by an article of war the use of the troops for the\r\nreturning of fugitive slaves to their masters, he earnestly supported,\r\nand the act of April 16, 1862, abolishing slavery in the District of\r\nColumbia, was a measure in which he especially interested himself, and\r\nwhose final passage he celebrated by an entertainment given to its\r\nmost devoted friends at his rooms in the National Hotel of Washington.\r\nThe abortive colonization schemes which were tried about this time, at\r\nMr. Lincoln's urgent recommendation, Mr. Chandler privately opposed\r\nas utterly inadequate and as a mere diversion of force into useless\r\nchannels, but for public reasons he made no open resistance to the\r\nexperiment. For the laws of June 19, 1862, forever prohibiting slavery\r\nin the territories, and of June 28, 1864, repealing the fugitive slave\r\nstatutes, it need not be said that he labored with unflagging industry.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler was very active in advocating the use of colored troops\r\nas soldiers, being months in advance of the Administration in this\r\nrespect; he urged this policy upon the authorities unsuccessfully\r\nfor weeks, and then worked earnestly to secure legislation from\r\nCongress authorizing the enrollment and enlistment of negroes. This\r\nmovement was so strenuously resisted at the capitol that in the end a\r\ncompromise was effected upon a bill, which was approved on July 16,\r\n1862, authorizing the receiving of colored men as laborers in the\r\narmy to dig trenches and do other work of non-combatants. But after\r\nthe Emancipation Proclamation black men were accepted as soldiers by\r\norder of the President, and regularly enrolled and paid. Mr. Chandler\r\nalways believed that that proclamation and the enlistment of freedmen\r\nin the army were two of the most powerful blows at the rebellion,\r\nand often remarked, when talking upon the subject, that they were\r\nworth 300,000 men. While the controversy over this important step\r\nwas unsettled, General Butler, at New Orleans, found himself in need\r\nof reinforcements, and was actually compelled to organize and arm\r\nseveral regiments of colored soldiers, whom he knew to be especially\r\nwell adapted to the performance of a certain class of duties in that\r\nregion which could not be done by soldiers from the North, who were\r\nnot acclimated. This step on his part followed his definite refusal,\r\nunder instructions from Washington, to permit General Phelps to do\r\nthe same thing (that officer resigning for this very reason.) While\r\nthe correspondence on this whole topic was in progress with the\r\nauthorities, General Butler appealed to Senator Chandler, writing him\r\nlong letters showing the sanitary necessity of having negro garrisons\r\nin some localities, and touching upon the other phases of the question.\r\nHe also asked the Senator's aid in securing arms and equipments for\r\nthese colored troops, and obtained from him valuable assistance in\r\npushing on the requisitions at the War Department in defiance of\r\nofficial \"red tape.\" On this general question Mr. Chandler said in the\r\nSenate, on June 28, 1864:\r\n\r\n  I believe that this rebellion is to be crushed, is to be\r\n  exterminated, and I believe that every man who favors it, whether\r\n  he be a member of this body or a member of the Southern army, is\r\n  to be crushed and to be exterminated, unless he repents. That is\r\n  what I believe.... I thank God the nation has risen to the point of\r\n  using every implement that the Almighty and common sense have put\r\n  in its hands to crush the rebellion.... We do not need another man\r\n  from north of the Potomac. Let us bring the loyal men of the South\r\n  in to put down treason in the South, and there are men enough and\r\n  more than enough to do it. We have heard enough about not using\r\n  black men to put down this rebellion. I would use every thing that\r\n  God and nature had put in my hands to put down this rebellion; but\r\n  first I would use the black element, bring every negro soldier who\r\n  can fight into the army. A negro is better than a traitor. I say\r\n  this advisedly. I consider a loyal negro better than a secession\r\n  traitor, either in the North or the South. I prefer him anywhere\r\n  and everywhere that you please to put him. A secession traitor is\r\n  beneath a loyal negro. I would let a loyal negro vote; I would let\r\n  him testify; I would let him fight; I would let him do any other\r\n  good thing and I would exclude a secession traitor.\r\n\r\nThe seizure of the rebel emissaries, Mason and Slidell, by Captain\r\nWilkes, on the British steamer Trent, was heartily applauded by Mr.\r\nChandler, and he opposed with much earnestness their surrender at the\r\ndemand of Great Britain. Mr Seward's policy in the matter seemed to him\r\nto be humiliating and the possibility of a second war, in case Captain\r\nWilkes was sustained, he did not dread, believing that the nation would\r\ntreble its military strength in the face of such a danger, that the\r\nSouth would suffer from an alliance with a country so long regarded as\r\nthe hereditary foe of the American people, and that the end would be\r\nthe conquest and annexation of the British American provinces. He was\r\ngreatly incensed by Great Britain's prompt concession of belligerent\r\nrights to the South and by its blustering bearing in the Trent case,\r\nand at one time suggested a policy of non-intercourse with that power,\r\nwhich he regarded as an inveterate enemy. In later years he advocated\r\nthe most vigorous pushing of \"the Alabama claims,\" and at the time\r\nof the British war with Abyssinia offered in the Senate a resolution\r\nrecognizing King Theodore as a \"belligerent\" in the general terms of\r\nthe Queen's proclamation of May, 1861 in regard to the Confederacy.\r\nHe never ceased to believe that the United States, in the settlement\r\nof its war claims with Great Britain, ought to have refused to accept\r\nanything less than the annexation of the Canadas.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler in the Senate favored imposing severe penalties on the\r\ngold gambling in Wall street, which affected so injuriously the\r\nnational credit. In the preparation of the internal revenue laws of\r\n1862, imposing a large number of taxes and affecting vast interests,\r\nhe gave exceedingly valuable aid, his own business experience and his\r\nfamiliarity with commercial details making his suggestions practical\r\nin form and wise in scope. Every measure to secure the stringent\r\nenforcement of the laws for the punishment of treason received his\r\nhearty support, and his denunciation of traitors and their open or\r\nsecret allies continued to be vigorous and unsparing.[26] His industry\r\ntime alone seemed to restrain, for his zeal was inexhaustible and his\r\nmagnificent physical powers bore the tremendous strain unyieldingly.\r\nHis public record during the four years of the war makes it possible\r\nto apply to him, without extravagance, Lord Clarendon's description of\r\nHampden: \"He was of a vigilance not to be tired out or wearied by the\r\nmost laborious, and of parts not to be imposed on by the most subtle or\r\nsharp, and of a personal courage equal to his best parts.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"little, nameless, unremembered acts\" of these days were of\r\nno slight aggregate importance and thoroughly illustrate the\r\ncharacteristics of the man. There was no reasonable service that he\r\nwas not quick to render to any volunteer who applied to him for aid. A\r\nblue uniform gained for its wearer prompt admittance to his room and\r\na careful hearing for any request. Repeatedly private soldiers saw\r\nhim leave men of rank and influence to listen to their stories, and\r\nlay aside matters of pressing moment to act upon their complaints or\r\nrelieve their distress.[27]\r\n\r\nHe visited the hospitals to seek out Michigan men whom he could\r\nhelp, and to see that they were properly provided for, while their\r\napplications for furloughs and for discharges, if entrusted to his\r\ncare, were so pushed as to obtain prompt action from the authorities\r\nin spite of routine and official tardiness. He advanced large sums of\r\nmoney to help destitute and invalid soldiers homeward,[28] or to aid\r\nthe friends of fallen or wounded men upon their melancholy errands.\r\nUpon all occasions he was especially attentive to the humblest\r\napplicants, and the ease of the private soldier in distress and need\r\ntouched his sympathies the most quickly. His was a familiar figure in\r\nall the departments, often accompanied with a squad of sick, crippled,\r\neven ragged, veterans, in search of delayed furloughs, or of arrears\r\nof pay, or of the medical examinations preceding invalid discharges,\r\nor of some service which \"red tape\" had delayed. In the words of one\r\nwho possessed abundant opportunities for obtaining knowledge, \"This\r\ncould be said of Mr. Chandler to a greater extent than of any other\r\npublic man I ever saw, that he would spare no pains in doing even\r\nlittle things for men who were of the smallest consequence to one in\r\nhis position. He would take great trouble in hunting up minor matters\r\nfor enlisted men, and this it was that made him so popular among the\r\nsoldiers.\" His activity in their behalf was not limited by State lines;\r\nhe answered any appeals that came to him, although he was especially\r\nprompt and vigilant in helping the \"Michigan boys.\"[29]\r\n\r\nAt the War Department Mr. Chandler was as well known as (and was\r\nreputed to be scarcely less powerful than) the Secretary himself. Mr.\r\nStanton's brusqueness never daunted him, and few stood upon such terms\r\nof privileged intercourse with that no less irascible than great man.\r\nRepeatedly he elbowed his way through the crowded ante-chamber of the\r\nSecretary's office, pushed past protesting orderlies, strode up to Mr.\r\nStanton's private desk, and obtained by emphatic personal application\r\nsome order which subordinates could not grant in a case needing prompt\r\naction.[30] Where other men would have encountered rebuff he rarely\r\nfailed. In connection with this phase of his public activity these\r\nletters are of interest:\r\n\r\n                                  DETROIT, Mich., July 29, 1862.\r\n\r\n  _Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War._\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR: Brigadier-General Richardson, of this State, is reported\r\n  as being absent from duty without leave. This is not true. He is\r\n  absent on sick leave, and is not able to join his command. Will\r\n  you not, in accordance with the wishes of the whole delegation,\r\n  assign him to the command of Michigan soldiers now being raised?\r\n  His presence here, and the assurance that he is to command, will\r\n  greatly stimulate enlistments. We are proud of him as one of the\r\n  best fighting generals of the army. Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                                            Z. CHANDLER.\r\n\r\n                                         DETROIT, July 31, 1862.\r\n\r\n  _Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War._\r\n\r\n  SIR: There is a fine company of ninety-five splendid men guarding\r\n  _three rebel prisoners_ at Mackinac. Would it not be well to put\r\n  those rascals in some tobacco warehouse or jail and send these\r\n  troops where they are needed? General Terry would like a command in\r\n  some other division than the one he is in. Can you not accommodate\r\n  him? The soldiers at Mackinac are anxious for active service and\r\n  are well drilled. Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                                            Z. CHANDLER.\r\n\r\n                                          DETROIT, Aug. 9, 1862.\r\n\r\n  _Adjutant-General Thomas._\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR: Are the boys of the Michigan First (Bull Run prisoners)\r\n  exchanged yet? I promised them it should be done at once, and now\r\n  find them enlisting again under the supposition that it has been\r\n  done. The list is with the Secretary of War. Our quota is full, and\r\n  our blood is up. They were yesterday paying $10 for a chance to\r\n  enter some of the regiments. Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                                            Z. CHANDLER.\r\n\r\n                                         DETROIT, Aug. 28, 1862.\r\n\r\n  _Hon. Wm. A. Howard._\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR: Will you say from me to the Secretary of War that I\r\n  deem it of vital importance that some one be authorized to open\r\n  and examine rebel correspondence passing through the Detroit\r\n  postoffice? Mr. Smith (of the postoffice) informs me that letters\r\n  come through directed to rebels at Windsor. Truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                                            Z. CHANDLER.\r\n\r\n                                         DETROIT, Nov. 15, 1863.\r\n\r\n  _Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War._\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR: I telegraphed you to-night to send heavy guns and\r\n  ammunition to the lakes. The reason was this: Upon examination\r\n  I found that we could improvise a navy in about two hours which\r\n  could cope with any rebel armament which could be placed upon the\r\n  lakes, _if we had big guns_. But my investigation furnished one\r\n  68-pounder, condemned, and four 32-pounders, without powder, at\r\n  Erie; and this was our whole armament on the lakes, except one\r\n  32-pounder upon the Michigan, and a few 6, 10 and 12-pounders. We\r\n  must have guns of large calibre at each of the principal ports.\r\n  If you cannot spare eleven-inch guns immediately send us some\r\n  eight-inch or some old 68-pounders, with ammunition. A tug,\r\n  costing not over $30,000, with one eleven-inch gun on board and\r\n  a crew of twenty men, could destroy a million dollars' worth of\r\n  property on the lakes every twenty-four hours, and we would be\r\n  powerless. She would sink the Michigan with one judiciously-placed\r\n  shell. We are not alarmed, but we want big guns and _must have\r\n  them_. The lake marine is scarcely second to the ocean in tonnage\r\n  and value, and it must be protected. We had no idea of our defenses\r\n  until the late scare. Truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                                            Z. CHANDLER.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler's influence with public men and in the private councils\r\nof the nation's leaders at Washington was throughout the war always\r\ninvigorating. From the very outset, and while the patriotic instinct\r\nof the North was \"still, as it were, in the gristle and not yet\r\nhardened into the bone,\" he urged upon the executive authorities\r\nsummary measures, and the striking of hard and quick blows. He advised\r\nthem to arrest traitors while their treason was still in the bud.\r\nHe urged them to make early and incessant attacks on the enemy, and\r\ncounseled implicit reliance on the devotion and loyalty of the North.\r\nThe Union cause saw no hour so dark that the eye of his courage could\r\nnot penetrate its gloom; the rebellion won no victory that shook his\r\nabsolutely \"dauntless resolution.\" Every suggestion of peace except on\r\nthe basis of Freedom and the national supremacy he denounced. Every\r\nhint of conciliating armed traitors he scouted as, in Hosea Biglow's\r\nphrase, mere \"tryin' squirt-guns on the infernal Pit.\" To the real\r\nstatesmanship of that period he thus gave expression in a public\r\ndinner at Washington early in 1863: \"We must accept no compromise; a\r\npatched-up peace will be followed by continued war and anarchy.\" He\r\nchafed like a caged lion before half-heartedness, imbecility and delay.\r\nHis sincerity and his earnestness revived the discouraged and aroused\r\nhope, and his strong convictions inspired men of weaker moral fibre\r\nwith something of his own inflexibility. He never hesitated to use\r\nplain words in dealing with the nation's enemies, he never lost faith,\r\nand he never admitted the possibility of defeat. At the White House\r\nhis visits were ever welcome, his advice received, and the virility\r\nof his understanding and the fervor of his patriotism recognized. Mr.\r\nChandler appreciated to the full extent the innate strength of Abraham\r\nLincoln's remarkable character and its rare loftiness, and, different\r\nas were their dispositions and widely divergent as often were their\r\nopinions, he never lost confidence in the President's aims and never\r\nceased to be one of his trusted counselors. Many features of executive\r\npolicy he condemned plainly and boldly to the President himself,\r\nbut frankness and sincerity prevented his criticisms from becoming\r\nunpalatable, and Mr. Lincoln often acknowledged his indebtedness to the\r\npractical wisdom and the tireless zeal of the Michigan Senator.\r\n\r\nCecil said to Sir Walter Raleigh, \"I know that you can toil terribly.\"\r\nThis Mr. Chandler did through those eventful years. His labor was\r\nwithout cessation. The great demands upon the energies of the public\r\nman were equaled by appeals for private effort which he would not\r\ndecline, and in every channel of profitable work for the Union cause\r\nhe made his strong will and his aggressive vitality felt. Industry,\r\nso unusual and efficient, multiplied the power of his Roman firmness,\r\nand these qualities, guided by his strong understanding, high courage,\r\nsincerity of conviction, and the ardor of his patriotism, made him a\r\nleader of men in years when leadership without strength was impossible.\r\nHis impress is upon the events of that era, and of the war for\r\nEmancipation and the Union he could say with Ulysses, \"I am part of\r\nall that I have met.\" Through the tempest of civil strife his strong\r\nspirit battled its way unflinchingly to the goal, and title was fitly\r\nbestowed in the people's knighting of Zachariah Chandler as \"The Great\r\nWar Senator.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[25] I pity the man who, in this hour of peril, stands back and says,\r\n\"this is an abolition war, and I won't go.\" ... There are but two\r\nclasses of men now in the United States, and there are no middle men;\r\nthese two classes are patriots and traitors. Between these two you must\r\nchoose. A man might as well cast himself into the gulf that separated\r\nDives from Lazarus as to stand out in this hour of trial.--_Speech at\r\nIonia on September 6._\r\n\r\nIt has taken time to educate us. If we had won certain victories the\r\nwar would have been over, but the cause would have remained. The\r\nproclamation pronouncing emancipation, for which God bless Abraham\r\nLincoln, is educating the people, and soon we will be ready to go\r\nforward.... We can never secure a permanent peace until we strike a\r\ndeath-blow at the cause of the war.--_Speech at Jackson on October 7._\r\n\r\n[26] Extract from a debate in the Senate on April 12, 1864:\r\n\r\nMR. POWELL, of Kentucky: The Senator from Michigan, if I understood\r\nhim, said that I was now the friend of traitors?\r\n\r\nMR. CHANDLER: You did understand me properly. You have been the friend\r\nof traitors, and I voted to expel you, as a traitor, from this body.\r\n\r\nMR. POWELL: Do I understand you to say that I am now the friend of\r\ntraitors and of treason?\r\n\r\nMR. CHANDLER: You co-operated with traitors, and I have never known you\r\nto cast a vote that was not in favor of rebellion.\r\n\r\n[27] It is exceedingly gratifying to witness the marked attention Mr.\r\nChandler bestows on soldiers. One day I happened to be in his room,\r\nwhen a major-general and a senator came in. Shortly after a sprightly\r\nyoung soldier came to the door. When about to enter, the young man\r\nhesitated to interrupt their conversation, but Mr. Chandler at once\r\ngave his attention to the soldier, who, on being asked to take a seat\r\nand tell what he desired, said he was a paroled prisoner and wished a\r\nfurlough home, and that he had been told that all he had to do was to\r\napply to him and he would be sure to get it. Mr. Chandler immediately\r\ntook his papers and secured the furlough for him.--_Washington letter\r\nof 1863._\r\n\r\n[28] Mr. Chandler said that during the late war, while he was in\r\nWashington, he loaned our soldiers several thousands of dollars, in\r\nsmall sums of from $2 to $10 each, but that the whole amount was repaid\r\nto him with the exception of about $10, and he was satisfied that the\r\npoor men who owed him that small amount had given their lives for their\r\ncountry.--_Hon. M. S. Brewer in the House of Representatives, Jan. 28,\r\n1880._\r\n\r\n[29] This tribute comes from a well-known officer of the Michigan\r\nvolunteer regiments:\r\n\r\n                                              DETROIT, February 3, 1880.\r\n\r\nCould all the acts of kindness and aid rendered by Senator Chandler to\r\nthe soldiers of Michigan, their families and friends, during the war,\r\nand especially to those who filled the ranks, be gathered together\r\nand written out, the volumes that contained them would be large and\r\nnumerous. No soldier, however humble, ever applied to him, when in\r\ndistress or trouble, that he did not receive a patient hearing and, if\r\npossible, speedy aid. No soldier's wife, father, mother, or other kin\r\never wrote him a letter that was not answered. To these facts there are\r\nthousands who can testify to-day, and many thousands more who could do\r\nso were they not in their graves.\r\n\r\nIn those dark days he was always sanguine of the final triumph of our\r\narmies, and he always assured the soldiers of his positive convictions\r\nthat in the end they would be victorious. None except those who had\r\nexperience can ever know what cheerful assurances and hopeful words\r\nfrom those high in authority did to nerve men for the work of severe\r\ncampaigns.\r\n\r\nThe trials and fatigues of army life, and the uncertainty of the\r\nfinal results, were lessened vastly by the assuring words of brave,\r\nindomitable men like Zachariah Chandler. All honor to his memory, as\r\nalso to the memory of his great associates in high places during those\r\nmemorable days!\r\n\r\n                                                            R. A. ALGER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[30] This anecdote is related by a prominent Michigan officer: I\r\naccompanied Senator Chandler once to the War Department to secure the\r\nre-instatement of a paymaster who, it had been clearly ascertained,\r\nhad been unjustly dismissed. The papers were in the possession of the\r\nproper bureau, and action had been promised, but was delayed. A great\r\nbody of eager applicants were gathered about the Secretary's door,\r\nwhich was guarded by two sentries with crossed bayonets. He pushed\r\nrapidly through the mass of people to the entrance of the private\r\noffice, where the sentinel said, \"The Secretary is very busy, Mr.\r\nSenator.\" \"I know he is,\" was Mr. Chandler's response, and laying a\r\nhand on each bayonet he pushed them up over our heads, opened the door,\r\nand we were in Mr. Stanton's presence. Once there, he commenced a\r\nvigorous denunciation of the tardiness of the Department, upbraided the\r\nSecretary because no action had yet been taken in the case according\r\nto promise, and astonished me by the earnestness of his criticisms.\r\nMr. Stanton heard him pleasantly, said when he stopped, \"Are you all\r\nthrough, Chandler?\" and then gave the order we needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN OF 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Republican reverses of the fall of 1862 were not repeated in 1863.\r\nGettysburg and Vicksburg, the anti-draft riots in New York, and the\r\nformal acceptance of Vallandigham as a trusted party leader by the\r\nDemocracy stimulated and strengthened the Union spirit of the North,\r\nand the State elections of that year were emphatic endorsements of\r\nthe party of freedom and of its policy. The political verdicts of\r\nthe spring of 1864 were equally gratifying to the friends of liberty\r\nand the advocates of a vigorous prosecution of the war, and, with\r\nthe accession of General Grant to the command of the Union armies\r\nand his \"advance all along the line,\" it became evident that nothing\r\nbut discord among the Republicans could deprive them of a sweeping\r\nvictory in the presidential election. The masses of that party were\r\nunequivocally in favor of Mr. Lincoln's renomination; the common people\r\nsaw one of themselves in the White House and fully met his firm trust\r\nin them with an answering confidence. But among men of influence within\r\nthe Republican ranks there was an exceedingly earnest opposition to\r\nhis second candidacy. Some of this sprang from rival aspirations;\r\nmore of it from disappointed office-seeking and from personal pique;\r\nbut there was outside and above such considerations a strong feeling,\r\nentirely disinterested in origin and honorable in character, and held\r\nby thousands of sincere men, that the President was unduly conservative\r\nin policy and that a man of more aggressive temperament ought to be\r\nelected in his stead. There were also not a few experienced politicians\r\nwho regarded the personal opposition to Mr. Lincoln as sufficiently\r\nformidable to jeopard party success, and who were inclined to think\r\nthat the selection of some candidate who was not identified with the\r\nexisting Administration, and thus would not be compelled to defend\r\nits acts, was demanded on the ground of superior \"availability.\" The\r\nanti-Lincoln wing of the party at that time included such men as\r\nMr. Chase and Mr. Greeley, was represented by many of the leading\r\nnewspapers, including the entire New York press except the _Times_,\r\nand counted among its especially active members not a few of the most\r\nearnest and devoted of the original Abolitionists.\r\n\r\nIn this chaotic condition of party sentiment a call appeared (in April,\r\n1864) addressed \"To the Radical Men of the Nation,\" and requesting them\r\nto meet by representatives in convention at Cleveland, O., on May 31.\r\nThose of its signers who were best known were B. Gratz Brown, Lucius\r\nRobinson, John Cochrane, Frederick Douglass, Elizabeth Cady Stanton,\r\nGeorge B. Cheever, James Redpath, Wendell Phillips and Emil Pretorious.\r\nIts tone will appear from this paragraph:\r\n\r\n  The imbecile and vacillating policy of the present Administration\r\n  in the conduct of the war, being just weak enough to waste its men\r\n  and means to provoke the enemy, but not strong enough to conquer\r\n  the rebellion--and its treachery to justice, freedom and genuine\r\n  democratic principles in its plan of reconstruction, whereby the\r\n  honor and dignity of the nation have been sacrificed to conciliate\r\n  the still-existing and arrogant slave power, and to further the\r\n  ends of unscrupulous partisan ambition--call in thunder tones upon\r\n  the lovers of justice and their country to come to the rescue of\r\n  the imperiled nationality and the cause of impartial and universal\r\n  freedom threatened with betrayal and overthrow.\r\n\r\n  The way to victory and salvation is plain. Justice must be throned\r\n  in the seats of national legislation, and guide the executive will.\r\n  The things demanded, and which we ask you to join us to render\r\n  sure, are the immediate extinction of slavery throughout the whole\r\n  United States by Congressional action, the absolute equality of\r\n  all men before the law without regard to race or color, and such a\r\n  plan of reconstruction as shall conform entirely to the policy of\r\n  freedom for all, placing the political power alone in the hands of\r\n  the loyal, and executing with vigor the law for confiscating the\r\n  property of the rebels.\r\n\r\nThis document was widely published, and the New York _Tribune_ in\r\nadvance approved the calling of this convention, although it did not in\r\nthe end support its action. The call was answered by about 350 persons\r\nfrom fifteen States; while very few of them were men of more than\r\nlimited reputation, yet they made up a body representing widespread\r\nconvictions strongly and sincerely held. Ex-Governor W. F. Johnston\r\nof Pennsylvania was the temporary and Gen. John Cochrane of New York\r\nthe permanent presiding officer of the convention. It nominated John\r\nC. Fremont for President, and General Cochrane for Vice-President, and\r\nadopted a platform exceedingly radical in terms, including declarations\r\nin favor of unconditional emancipation, a one-term presidency, the\r\nMonroe doctrine, and the wholesale confiscation of the property of the\r\nrebels. Two letters were received by it which at the time produced a\r\nstrong impression. In one of them, Lucius Robinson, then Comptroller of\r\nNew York, severely condemned \"a weak Executive and Cabinet,\" and urged\r\nthe nomination of General Grant, \"a man who has displayed the qualities\r\nwhich give all men confidence.\" In the second, Wendell Phillips\r\nattacked a Republican administration with that polished invective which\r\nhad made him one of the most formidable assailants of the slave power.\r\nHe wrote:\r\n\r\n  For three years the Administration has lavished money without\r\n  stint and drenched the land in blood, and it has not yet\r\n  thoroughly and heartily struck at the slave system. Confessing\r\n  that the use of this means is indispensable, the Administration\r\n  has used it just enough to irritate the rebels and not enough to\r\n  save the state. In sixty days after the rebellion broke out the\r\n  Administration suspended _habeas corpus_ on the plea of military\r\n  necessity--justly. For three years it has poured out the treasure\r\n  and blood of the country like water. Meanwhile slavery was too\r\n  sacred to be used; that was saved lest the feelings of the rebels\r\n  should be hurt. The Administration weighed treasure, blood, and\r\n  civil liberty against slavery, and, up to the present moment, has\r\n  decided to exhaust them all before it uses freedom heartily as a\r\n  means of battle.... A quick and thorough reorganization of States\r\n  on a democratic basis--every man and race equal before the law--is\r\n  the only sure way to save the Union. I urge it, not for the black\r\n  man's sake alone, but for ours--for the nation's sake. Against\r\n  such recognition of the blacks Mr. Lincoln stands pledged by\r\n  prejudice and avowal. Men say, if we elect him he may change his\r\n  views. Possibly. But three years have been a long time for a man's\r\n  education in such hours as these. The nation cannot afford more. At\r\n  any rate the constitution gives this summer an opportunity to make\r\n  President a man fully educated. I prefer that course.\r\n\r\n  The Administration, therefore, I regard as a civil and military\r\n  failure, and its avowed policy ruinous to the North in every point\r\n  of view. Mr. Lincoln may wish the end--peace and freedom--but he\r\n  is wholly unwilling to use the means which can secure that end.\r\n  If Mr. Lincoln is re-elected I do not expect to see the Union\r\n  reconstructed in my day, unless on terms more disastrous to liberty\r\n  than even disunion would be. If I turn to General Fremont, I see a\r\n  man whose first act would be to use the freedom of the negro as his\r\n  weapon; I see one whose thorough loyally to democratic institutions\r\n  without regard to race, whose earnest and decisive character, whose\r\n  clear-sighted statesmanship and rare military ability justify my\r\n  confidence that in his hands all will be done to save the state\r\n  that foresight, skill, decision, and statesmanship can do.\r\n\r\nGenerals Fremont and Cochrane promptly accepted the nominations\r\nthus tendered them. General Fremont resigned his commission in the\r\narmy before doing so, and in his letter of acceptance accused the\r\nAdministration of \"incapacity and selfishness,\" of \"managing the war\r\nfor personal ends,\" of giving to the country \"the abuses of a military\r\ndictation without its unity of action and vigor of execution,\" and of\r\n\"feebleness and want of principle\" in its dealings with other powers.\r\nHe further vindicated the Cleveland action by declaring that, \"if\r\nMr. Lincoln had remained faithful to the principles he was elected\r\nto defend, no schism could have been created,\" and added: \"If the\r\nconvention at Baltimore will nominate any man whose past life justifies\r\na well-grounded confidence in his fidelity to our cardinal principles,\r\nthere is no reason why there should be any division among the really\r\npatriotic men of the country.\" There was a lack of any popular response\r\nto this demonstration, and it at once appeared--and, in fact, this was\r\nthe sum of the original expectations of its shrewder promoters--that\r\nthis movement was only formidable as a rallying point for any serious\r\ndisaffection which might spring up in the future.\r\n\r\nThe \"Union National\" convention assembled at Baltimore on June 7,\r\nwith every State, except those still wholly in possession of the\r\nrebels, represented upon its floor. It adopted a platform denouncing\r\nany peace by compromise, endorsing the Administration, and demanding\r\nthe abolition of slavery by constitutional amendment. Abraham Lincoln\r\nwas renominated for the Presidency, receiving every vote save that of\r\nthe delegation of Missouri radicals who supported General Grant, and\r\nAndrew Johnson was on the first ballot nominated for Vice-President as\r\nthe representative of the Union men of the South. The response of the\r\nmasses and the leading papers of the Republican organization to this\r\naction was prompt and hearty; but, notwithstanding this encouraging\r\nfact, the political horizon grew rapidly darker. General Grant was in\r\nthat summer fighting a series of bloody battles on and about the banks\r\nof the James, whose immediate results were indecisive, the attendant\r\nsteady reduction of Lee's available force not being then apparent at\r\nthe North. In like manner, Sherman was forcing his way through the\r\nmountainous regions between Chattanooga and Atlanta, winning no great\r\nvictories and losing thousands of men; the mortal effects of his blows\r\nat the rebels are evident now, but could not be seen then. General\r\nEarly, in July, swept down the Shenandoah and over the Potomac, burning\r\nChambersburg and threatening the defenses of Washington, finally\r\nmaking good his retreat. In the face of this military situation, so\r\nencouraging to discontent and so calculated to invite criticism, the\r\npremium on gold rose rapidly to its highest war point. This disastrous\r\ndepreciation of the paper money of the government was materially\r\nhelped by the unexpected resignation, on June 30, of Secretary of the\r\nTreasury Salmon P. Chase. Differences of opinion as to some details\r\nof department management were assigned as the cause of this step,\r\nbut its real origin was much deeper, and Mr. Chase's course was\r\nuniversally ascribed, and was undoubtedly due, to lack of sympathy\r\nwith and confidence in the Administration. The effect of a change in\r\nso important a position at such a critical moment was profound, and it\r\ngave a powerful stimulus to Republican disaffection. This was followed\r\nby the abortive peace negotiations at Niagara Falls with C. C. Clay, J.\r\nP. Holcombe and G. N. Sanders. That this was a crafty scheme to place\r\nthe Administration in a false position before both the North and the\r\nSouth cannot now be doubted. It failed to yield all that its projectors\r\nhoped, but it did ensnare Mr. Greeley most disagreeably, and it had the\r\neffect of furnishing the enemy with grounds for charging the President\r\nwith being \"hostile to peace except on impossible conditions.\" It\r\nalso materially augmented the public restlessness and deepened the\r\nvague apprehensions which naturally sprang from such exhibitions of\r\ncross-purposes among the leaders of the national cause. Another event\r\nfollowed which was of still graver moment:\r\n\r\nThe problem of the reconstruction of the Southern States after the\r\ndefeat of the rebel armies was from the outset surrounded with grave\r\ndifficulties, and the views held upon this subject by the ablest\r\nRepublicans were diverse and conflicting. Bills and resolutions\r\nembodying various theories of reconstruction were presented in\r\nCongress early in the war, but nothing was done with them, and no\r\ndefinite policy was fixed by enactment or even determined upon in\r\nprivate consultations. On Dec. 8, 1863, and in connection with the\r\ntransmission to Congress of his third annual message, Mr. Lincoln\r\nissued a proclamation offering amnesty to all rebels (with a few\r\nconspicuous exceptions) who should take an oath of loyalty, and\r\ndeclaring that whenever, in any of the seceded States, persons to the\r\nnumber of not less than one-tenth of the votes cast in such States at\r\nthe presidential election of 1860, having first taken and abided by the\r\nprescribed oath, should re-establish a State government, republican in\r\nform and recognizing the permanent freedom of the slaves, it should\r\n\"be recognized as the true government of the State.\" This plan Mr.\r\nLincoln explained and defended at length in the message, and under it\r\nprovisional governments were soon organized in Louisiana and Arkansas,\r\nand application was made for the admission of their Senators and\r\nRepresentatives to Congress. The President's action in this respect did\r\nnot receive congressional sanction and was not endorsed by the majority\r\nof his supporters at the capitol. Many held that the subject was one\r\nwhich was wholly within the control of the legislative branch of the\r\ngovernment, and that his proclamation was itself an unwarrantable\r\nassumption of authority by the Executive. Others objected strenuously\r\nto the \"one-tenth clause,\" as oligarchical in tendency and certain to\r\nleave the real advantages of position within easy reach of the disloyal\r\nmajority in any State thus reconstructed. As a rule those who opposed\r\nMr. Lincoln's scheme favored establishing provisional governments in\r\nthe South until there should spring up a loyal majority, which could be\r\nsafely trusted with political power. Congress, therefore, referred the\r\nmessage and proclamation to special committees, refused to recognize\r\nthe Louisiana and Arkansas governments, and passed on the last day of\r\nthe session a reconstruction act differing radically in terms from the\r\nPresident's plan. Its bill provided that provisional governors should\r\nbe appointed with the consent of the Senate, that an enrollment of\r\nwhite male citizens should be made when armed resistance ceased in\r\nany State, and that when a majority of the citizens so enrolled took\r\nthe oath of allegiance the loyal people should be entitled to elect\r\ndelegates to a convention to establish a State government; upon the\r\nadoption of an anti-slavery constitution by such a convention it was\r\nto be certified to the President, who, with the assent of Congress,\r\nwas to recognize the government thus established as \"the lawful State\r\ngovernment.\" This measure the President defeated by withholding his\r\nsignature. On July 8, 1864, he issued a second proclamation upon the\r\nsubject, setting forth that he had not signed this bill because \"less\r\nthan one hour\" intervened between its passage and the adjournment of\r\nCongress, and because he was not ready by its approval to be inexorably\r\ncommitted to this or any other specific plan of reconstruction which\r\nwould set aside the _quasi_-governments of Louisiana and Arkansas and\r\nthus repel their citizens from further efforts in the same direction.\r\nHe added that he was not yet prepared to admit the \"constitutional\r\ncompetency of Congress to abolish slavery in the States,\" although he\r\ndid earnestly desire that it should cease through the adoption of a\r\nconstitutional amendment. The proclamation closed by declaring that he\r\nwas satisfied with the terms of the bill, and by pledging the hearty\r\nco-operation of the Executive with all who might avail themselves\r\nof the method therein laid down to return to their places in the\r\nUnion. In response to this proclamation, which treated the process\r\nof reconstruction as a matter of executive discretion merely, there\r\nwas published early in August a vigorously worded and cogently argued\r\nmanifesto, addressed \"To the Supporters of the Government,\" and signed\r\nby Senator Benjamin F. Wade and Representative Henry Winter Davis, as\r\nchairmen of the committees of their respective houses upon the _status_\r\nof the rebel States. This document commenced with the declaration that\r\nits authors had \"read without surprise, but not without indignation,\"\r\nthe President's proclamation, and proceeded as follows:\r\n\r\n  The President, by preventing this bill from becoming a law, holds\r\n  the electoral votes of the rebel States at the dictation of his\r\n  personal ambition. If those votes turn the balance in his favor, is\r\n  it to be supposed that his competitor, defeated by such means, will\r\n  acquiesce? If the rebel majority assert their supremacy in those\r\n  States, and send votes which elect an enemy of the government,\r\n  will we not repel his claims? And is not that civil war for the\r\n  presidency inaugurated by the votes of rebel States? Seriously\r\n  impressed with these dangers, Congress, \"the proper constitutional\r\n  authority,\" formally declared that there are no State governments\r\n  in the rebel States, and provided for their erection at a proper\r\n  time; and both the Senate and House of Representatives rejected\r\n  the Senators and Representatives chosen under the authority of\r\n  what the President calls the free constitution and government of\r\n  Arkansas. The President's proclamation \"holds for naught\" this\r\n  judgment, and discards the authority of the Supreme Court and\r\n  strides headlong toward the anarchy his proclamation of the 8th of\r\n  December inaugurated. If electors for President be allowed to be\r\n  chosen in either of those States, a sinister light will be cast\r\n  on the motives which induced the President to \"hold for naught\"\r\n  the will of Congress rather than his governments in Louisiana and\r\n  Arkansas. That judgment of Congress which the President defies was\r\n  the exercise of an authority exclusively vested in Congress by\r\n  the constitution to determine what is the established government\r\n  in a State, and in its own nature and by the highest of judicial\r\n  authority binding on all other departments of the government....\r\n  A more studied outrage on the legislative authority of the people\r\n  has never been perpetrated. Congress passed a bill; the President\r\n  refused to approve it, and then by proclamation puts as much of\r\n  it in force as he sees fit, and proposes to execute those parts\r\n  by officers unknown to the laws of the United States and not\r\n  subject to the confirmation of the Senate! The bill directed the\r\n  appointment of provisional governors by and with the advice and\r\n  consent of the Senate. The President, after defeating such a law,\r\n  proposes to appoint without law, and without the advice and consent\r\n  of the Senate, military governors for the rebel States! He has\r\n  already exercised this dictatorial usurpation in Louisiana, and he\r\n  defeated the bill to prevent its limitation....\r\n\r\n  The President has greatly presumed on the forbearance which the\r\n  supporters of his administration have so long practiced, in view\r\n  of the arduous conflict in which we are engaged, and the reckless\r\n  ferocity of our political opponents. But he must understand that\r\n  our support is of a cause and not of a man; that the authority of\r\n  Congress is paramount and must be respected; and that the whole\r\n  body of the Union men of Congress will not submit to be impeached\r\n  by him of rash and unconstitutional legislation; and if he wishes\r\n  our support, he must confine himself to his executive duties--to\r\n  obey and execute, not make the laws--to suppress by arms armed\r\n  rebellion, and leave political reorganization to Congress.\r\n\r\n  If the supporters of the government fail to insist on this, they\r\n  become responsible for the usurpations which they fail to rebuke,\r\n  and are justly liable to the indignation of the people, whose\r\n  rights and security, committed to their keeping, they sacrifice.\r\n  Let them consider the remedy for these usurpations, and, having\r\n  found it, fearlessly execute it!\r\n\r\nThe damaging force of this attack was undoubted. Mr. Wade was a\r\nveteran of the anti-slavery \"Old Guard,\" and was known through the\r\nNorth to be as sturdy, true and honest as he was \"radical\" in his\r\nRepublicanism. No man sat in the House who surpassed--but few men\r\nthen in public life equaled--Henry Winter Davis in mental vigor, in\r\nbrilliant accomplishments, and in moral fearlessness. Originally sent\r\nto Congress by the Maryland \"Americans,\" it was his vote which elected\r\nMr. Pennington to the Speakership in 1859; to the formal censure of\r\nthat act by his Legislature he replied by telling the men who voted\r\nfor it to take their message back to their masters, for only to their\r\nmasters, the people, would he reply. He made a magnificent fight\r\nagainst secession in his State, and waged there a still more gallant\r\nbattle for emancipation, winning both. In the House he spoke always\r\nwith force, often with impassioned eloquence, and the Republican\r\nranks contained no champion more ardent in patriotism or more firmly\r\nattached to the fundamental principles of Freedom. The formal uniting\r\nof these two men, both able, influential and unquestionably sincere,\r\nin strictures so severe upon the President, materially invigorated the\r\n\"radical\" opposition to the Baltimore ticket, increased Republican\r\ndiscouragement, and furnished the Opposition with additional ground\r\nfor accusing the President of the gross use of arbitrary power. The\r\nseries of events thus recapitulated naturally gave to the action of the\r\nCleveland convention a fresh importance, and by the fall of 1864 it had\r\nbecome a factor of moment in the political calculations of the year.\r\n\r\nGreatly encouraged by the evident demoralization of the dominant\r\nparty, the Democrats held their national convention at Chicago on\r\nAugust 29. Its platform in effect declared the war \"a failure,\" and\r\nits ticket consisted of George B. McClellan, representing war without\r\nvigor, and George H. Pendleton, representing peace by compromise. The\r\nmost conspicuous figure on its floor was Clement L. Vallandigham, a\r\nbanished traitor _posing_ as a martyr, and the sedition which was\r\nthinly disguised in its deliberations was boldly shouted to cheering\r\nmobs about its hall and in front of the great hotels which its\r\ndelegates thronged. The character and action of this body made clear\r\nthe issues of 1864; in Mr. Seward's apt language, the people were\r\ncalled upon to decide whether they would have \"McClellan and Disunion\r\nor Lincoln and Union.\" To make the latter the accepted alternative was\r\nimpossible without complete Republican harmony, and to restore that\r\nfully and promptly was plainly a matter of the first importance. This\r\ntask was undertaken by Mr. Chandler, whose relations with all parties\r\npeculiarly fitted him for the work. He was a pronounced \"radical,\" and\r\nhad steadfastly opposed many features of Mr. Lincoln's policy;[31] but\r\nhonest disagreement of opinion had not impaired his full confidence\r\nin the man, and that firm grasp upon the practical aspects of all\r\npolitical questions, which was one of his marked characteristics then\r\nas always, prevented him from putting in jeopardy essentials by unduly\r\nmagnifying differences as to details. To the wisdom of renominating\r\nMr. Lincoln he assented, and his election he believed necessary to the\r\npreservation of the government. With Mr. Wade he was on terms of the\r\nclosest intimacy; both Mr. Davis and General Fremont were his personal\r\nfriends; and his record and public attitude gave him a claim upon\r\nthe attention of the \"radicals\" everywhere. His qualifications as a\r\nmediator were thus numerous and apparent, and were rounded out by his\r\npolitical experience and sagacity.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler commenced work by visiting Mr. Wade at his home in Ohio,\r\nbeing accompanied thither by his intimate friend and adviser, the Hon.\r\nGeorge Jerome of Detroit. The Ohio senator's vigorous common sense was\r\nMr. Chandler's ally in the long interview that followed, and it only\r\nrequired a thorough review of the situation to convince him that, if\r\nLincoln was defeated, the Union cause, and not an individual, would\r\nbe the sufferer. Mr. Wade, however, urged that Mr. Lincoln himself\r\nshould make some sacrifices of opinion and preference in the face of\r\nthe common danger, that the \"radical\" element of the Republicans was\r\nentitled to more considerate treatment at his hands, and that, at\r\nleast, his Cabinet, which was wholly within his control, should not\r\ncontain men who were obnoxious to the stanchest members of his own\r\nparty. Mr. Wade then denounced in the strongest terms the presence\r\nin and influence upon the Administration of Montgomery Blair, whom\r\nhe believed to be at heart a Democrat. Later years have shown how\r\nwell-grounded were the doubts then felt of Mr. Blair's political\r\ntrustworthiness, doubts which were, even in 1864, general and strong\r\nenough to lead the Baltimore convention to declare in its platform\r\nthat it regarded \"as worthy of public confidence and official trust\r\nonly those who cordially endorsed\" its principles. Mr. Wade readily\r\nagreed, as the result of this conference, to pursue any course that\r\nshould command the approval of his associate in the manifesto, and Mr.\r\nChandler left him to visit Mr. Lincoln at Washington and Henry Winter\r\nDavis at Baltimore. He obtained from the President what were practical\r\nassurances that Mr. Blair should not be retained in the Cabinet in the\r\nface of such strong opposition if harmony would follow his removal. Mr.\r\nDavis promptly recognized the logic of the situation, and expressed his\r\nwillingness to accept Blair's displacement as an olive branch and give\r\nhis earnest support to the Baltimore ticket.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler next proceeded to New York, and opened negotiations there\r\nwith the managers of the Fremont movement. He had expected Mr. Wade to\r\njoin him, but was disappointed in this; he met at the Astor House the\r\nHon. David II. Jerome of Saginaw and the Hon. Ebenezer O. Grosvenor of\r\nJonesville, with whom he frequently counseled, and he also obtained the\r\nassistance of George Wilkes of the _Spirit of the Times_. Mr. Wilkes\r\nwas well known as the master of a pure and vigorous English, and no war\r\ncorrespondent equaled him in accurate, lucid and graphic descriptions\r\nof important movements and famous battles. The public, however, did\r\nnot know the extent of his political ability, of his skill in affairs\r\nand of his patriotic energy, and these qualities proved of the highest\r\nusefulness to Mr. Chandler in the completion of his delicate mission.\r\nWithout the aid so intelligently and zealously rendered by Mr. Wilkes,\r\nMr. Chandler doubted whether complete success would have been possible.\r\nThe negotiations were protracted for some days, but ultimately the\r\nleaders of the Fremont organization agreed that, if Mr. Blair (whom\r\nGeneral Fremont regarded as a bitter enemy) left the Cabinet and all\r\nother sources of Republican opposition to the Baltimore nominees were\r\nremoved, the Cleveland ticket should be formally withdrawn from the\r\nfield. While these conferences were in progress Mr. Chandler learned\r\nthat the editor of one of the influential evening papers of New York,\r\nwho had originally doubted the propriety of Mr. Lincoln's renomination,\r\nhad concluded that his election was not possible and had prepared \"a\r\nleader\" urging his withdrawal, the holding of a second convention, and\r\nRepublican union upon either General Fremont or some other candidate\r\nwho could command the solid party support. It was not until the day\r\nof the intended publication of the article and after it was in type\r\nthat Mr. Chandler learned of its existence, and then by instant and\r\nearnest efforts he obtained its withholding until the result of\r\nhis labors could be known. Ultimately all obstacles yielded to his\r\npersistence and skill, and he started for the capital to inform Mr.\r\nLincoln of the close of the negotiations and to ask the fulfillment of\r\nthe assurances concerning Mr. Blair's removal. On reaching Washington\r\nhe went instantly to the White House, was admitted to an immediate\r\nprivate interview with the President in preference to a great throng\r\nof visitors, and reported in detail the successful result of his\r\nlabors. On the day of this call upon Mr. Lincoln (Sept. 22, 1864) the\r\nnewspapers published General Fremont's letter withdrawing his name as a\r\npresidential candidate. In it he said:\r\n\r\n  The presidential contest has in effect been entered upon in such a\r\n  way that the union of the Republican party has become a paramount\r\n  necessity. The policy of the Democratic party signifies either\r\n  separation or re-establishment with slavery. The Chicago platform\r\n  is simply separation. General McClellan's letter of acceptance is\r\n  re-establishment with slavery. The Republican candidate is, on the\r\n  contrary, pledged to the re-establishment of the Union _without_\r\n  slavery, and, however hesitating his policy may be, the pressure of\r\n  his party will, we may hope, force him to it. Between these issues\r\n  I think that no man of the Liberal party can remain in doubt. I\r\n  believe I am consistent with my antecedents and my principles in\r\n  withdrawing--- not to aid in the triumph of Mr. Lincoln, but to do\r\n  my part toward preventing the election of the Democratic candidate.\r\n  In respect to Mr. Lincoln, I continue to hold exactly the\r\n  sentiments contained in my letter of acceptance. I consider that\r\n  his administration has been politically, militarily and financially\r\n  a failure, and that its necessary continuance is a cause of regret\r\n  to the country.\r\n\r\nOn the following day this correspondence took place:\r\n\r\n                  EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, Sept. 23, 1864.\r\n\r\n  _Hon. Montgomery Blair._\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR: You have generously said to me more than once that,\r\n  whenever your resignation could be a relief to me, it was at my\r\n  disposal. That time has come. You very well know that this proceeds\r\n  from no dissatisfaction of mine with you personally or officially.\r\n  Your uniform kindness has been unsurpassed by that of any friend,\r\n  and while it is true that the war does not seem greatly to add to\r\n  the difficulties of your department, as to those of some others, it\r\n  is not too much to say, which I most truly can, that in the three\r\n  years and a half during which you have administered the general\r\n  postoffice I remember no single complaint against you in connection\r\n  therewith. Yours as ever,\r\n\r\n                                                        ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n                                  POSTOFFICE DEPARTMENT, Sept. 23, 1864.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR: I have received your note of this date referring to\r\n  my offer to resign whenever you would deem it advisable for the\r\n  public interest that I should do so, and stating that in your\r\n  judgment that time has come. I now, therefore, formally tender my\r\n  resignation of the office of Postmaster-General.\r\n\r\n  I cannot take leave of you without renewing the expression of my\r\n  gratitude for the uniform kindness which has marked your course\r\n  toward me.\r\n\r\n                               Yours truly,\r\n                                                                M. BLAIR.\r\n\r\n  _To the President._\r\n\r\nMr. Blair's resignation was accepted by the majority of Republicans\r\nthroughout the North as a \"cleansing of the Cabinet,\"[32] and party\r\nlines were at once re-formed. The \"radicals\" became earnest supporters\r\nof the Baltimore ticket, no Republican demand for a new nomination or a\r\nsecond convention appeared, Mr. Davis ceased his trenchant criticisms,\r\nand Mr. Wade took the stump and made a series of exceedingly effective\r\nspeeches in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Military success also came with its\r\npowerful help. General Sherman crowned his campaign by the capture of\r\nAtlanta, General Grant drew the coils of \"the anaconda\" daily tighter\r\nabout the rebel capital, and General Sheridan fairly \"swept\" Early from\r\nthe valley of the Shenandoah. The results of the September elections\r\nhad been dubious in significance, but those of October were decisive\r\nRepublican victories and preceded an overwhelming triumph in November.\r\nMr. Chandler (who had in 1863 taken an active share in the campaigns in\r\nNew York and Illinois,[33] Michigan not holding any general election\r\nin that year) returned from his labors of mediation to his own State\r\nand spoke to almost daily mass-meetings in its chief towns throughout\r\nthe month of October. Michigan gave to the Lincoln electors a majority\r\nof 16,917, and sent only Republicans to the Thirty-ninth Congress. Mr.\r\nChandler's contribution to this result was not unimportant, but it\r\nwas of meagre value compared with his labors upon a broader field in\r\nhealing grave dissensions and in quietly removing a cause of danger\r\nwhich was deeply founded, and which, although now almost forgotten, was\r\nthen of no slight actual proportions and of very serious possibilities.\r\nIt was characteristic of the man that this self-prompted and successful\r\nservice, one of the greatest he ever rendered to Republicanism, was\r\nrarely mentioned by him afterward, and never as if it was more than\r\nwas due to the cause of his political faith nor as if it gave him any\r\nespecial claim upon the party gratitude.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[31] Mr. Chandler explained the ground of his opposition to the ten\r\nper cent. loyal basis plan of reconstruction proposed by Mr. Lincoln\r\nfor the admission of Louisiana and Arkansas. There were not more\r\nthan seven or eight members of the Senate with him at the beginning\r\nof the session on that question, although there was a large majority\r\nbefore its close. The Democrats did not believe in this ten per cent.\r\ndoctrine, and they voted with those who did not believe in admitting\r\nthose States without guarantees. This admission was finally prevented\r\nby a night of filibustering. Only six Republicans remained and voted\r\nduring that night. The result, however, proved that those six men were\r\nright, and that Mr. Lincoln and the others were wrong. If Louisiana and\r\nArkansas had been admitted, then we would have been compelled to admit\r\nall the other States in the same way, and to-day we would have eleven\r\nrebel States in the Union. Those two States, Louisiana and Arkansas,\r\nhad become the most intensely rebel of all the States that were in\r\nrebellion.--_Report of his speech, before the Republican caucus at\r\nLansing on Jan. 6, 1869._\r\n\r\n[32] Mr. Greeley's comment in the New York \"Tribune\" was: \"Precisely\r\nwhy Mr. Lincoln thought this action called for at this moment, rather\r\nthan at any other time in the last four months, we are not told.\" This\r\nchapter shows that Mr. Chandler could have \"told\" him.\r\n\r\n[33] If the North had been a unit the rebellion would long ago have\r\nbeen crushed. But the rebels found out we were not a unit at any time,\r\nso they persevered, so they invaded Pennsylvania, so they hoped to take\r\nWashington, and to raise insurrection all over the land. The only hope\r\nof the South to-day is in the traitors of the North.... They will fail\r\nin the contest. Instead of having established a slave empire they will\r\nhave, by their own acts, destroyed all the securities that slavery\r\never possessed. They will have swept away all the compromises by which\r\nslavery has been tolerated by a forbearing people.--_Senator Chandler\r\nat Springfield, Ill., on Sept. 7, 1863._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE ADMINISTRATION OF ANDREW JOHNSON--RECONSTRUCTION AND IMPEACHMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening of April 14, 1865, Abraham Lincoln was assassinated\r\nat Ford's theater in the city of Washington. The universal grief was\r\nfitly described by Disraeli, who said, in the British Commons, that the\r\ncharacter of the victim and the circumstances of his death took the\r\nevent \"out of all the pomp of history and the ceremonial of diplomacy;\r\nit touched the heart of nations and appealed to the domestic sentiment\r\nof mankind.\" Its effect upon the American people was profound, and it\r\ndeepened vastly the public appreciation of the essential barbarity of\r\nthe prejudices, passions and ambitions which had plunged the republic\r\ninto civil war.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Committee on the Conduct of the War returned on\r\nthe evening of this crime from Richmond, having made an unsuccessful\r\nattempt to visit North Carolina for the purpose of taking testimony in\r\nregard to the Fort Fisher expedition. On the following morning they\r\nmet, and addressed a formal note to Andrew Johnson, who had, while a\r\nSenator, served upon that committee, expressing the wish of his \"old\r\nassociates\" to call upon him and acquaint him with \"many things which\r\nthey had seen and heard at Richmond.\" They were promptly admitted to\r\nhis apartments at the Kirkwood House, and were among the first to talk\r\nfreely with the man who had been so tragically made President of the\r\nnewly-restored Union. Mr. Johnson had just been sworn into office by\r\nChief Justice Chase in the presence of some of the Cabinet and a few\r\nCongressmen, and naturally the conversation chiefly turned upon the\r\npursuit of the assassins, and the proper punishment of the men who\r\nhad inspired or countenanced this crime, as well as of its actual\r\ncommitters. As a sequel of this conference, an important meeting was\r\nheld on the following day (Sunday, April 16, 1865) in the President's\r\nrooms. By appointment Senators Chandler and Wade and John Covode (an\r\noriginal member of the Committee on the Conduct of the War, then a\r\ncontestant for a seat in the House) called upon Mr. Johnson, and\r\nproceeded to consider with him what policy should be pursued toward\r\nthe chiefs of the conquered rebellion. They believed that the public\r\ninterest required that examples should be made of a few of the more\r\nguilty of the Southern traitors, and urged such a course upon the\r\nPresident. They found him--confronted as he was with the danger of\r\nassassination, and recollecting his own sufferings as a Southern\r\nUnionist--eager for measures of extreme rigor, and were compelled at\r\nthe outset to seek to moderate a violence of intention on his part,\r\nwhich was certain to defeat the aim they were anxious to secure,\r\nnamely: that of impressing the public with a sense of the justice as\r\nwell as the severity of the punishment of deliberate and inexcusable\r\ntreason. Andrew Johnson's disposition was to give to the contemplated\r\nproceedings rather a revengeful than a sternly retributive complexion.\r\nThe relations of Mr. Chandler, Mr. Wade and Mr. Covode with their\r\nformer fellow-committeeman were then exceedingly intimate, and they\r\nlabored to restrain his vehemence and to direct his determination into\r\na channel of action which should be just and not passionate, and should\r\nthus yield wholesome influences. It had been suggested that Davis\r\nand other fugitive rebels should be allowed to escape to Mexico or\r\nEurope, and the question of their punishment thus evaded; this plan was\r\npromptly condemned by all the participants in the conference, and there\r\nwas a general agreement that the leaders of the rebellion should be\r\narrested as rapidly as possible and held to answer for their offenses.\r\nThe next question that arose related to the best method of procedure\r\nafter these men had been captured, and then it was decided than Gen.\r\nBenjamin F. Butler should be sent for to give his advice as a lawyer.\r\nMr. Covode undertook this errand and soon returned with him. Mr.\r\nChandler then stated to General Butler the subject of the conference,\r\nand the President added that he was anxious to make a historical\r\nexample of the leading traitors, for its moral effect upon the future,\r\nand took exceedingly extreme ground on this point, much more so than\r\nthe other gentlemen were willing to approve. All of those present\r\nexpressed their opinions in turn, after Mr. Johnson had concluded, and\r\nall agreed upon one point, namely: that in the case of the seizure of\r\nJefferson Davis he should be summarily punished by death. Mr. Chandler\r\nremarked, with emphasis:\r\n\r\n\"You have only to hang a few of these traitors and all will be peace\r\nand quiet in the South. A few men have done the mischief, and the\r\nmasses of the people were misled by them. They have put the country\r\nin great peril to gratify their political ambition and they ought to\r\nsuffer the penalty of treason as a warning to all men hereafter.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Andrew Johnson replied that Mr. Chandler could not know the\r\nfull enormity of the crime Davis and his associates had committed,\r\nthat Northern men could never realize the sufferings the rebellion had\r\nbrought upon the loyal people of the South, and that no punishment\r\ncould be too severe. He added that he was determined that a precedent\r\nshould be established that would be forever a terror to such men as had\r\nconspired to overthrow the government.\r\n\r\nAfter some further conversation, the President asked General Butler\r\nfor his professional opinion, as to whether Davis, Benjamin, Floyd,\r\nWigfall, and the other civil officers of the Confederacy, could be\r\ntried by a military commission. General Butler replied that if they\r\ncould be arrested in the insurrectionary States--in any locality\r\nunder military control and where no civil authority existed or was\r\nrecognized--they could be arraigned before such a tribunal, but a court\r\nof this character would have no jurisdiction if the criminals should\r\nget upon foreign soil, or, before being apprehended, reach any district\r\nwhere the civil law was in force. Mr. Chandler then urged that Davis\r\nshould, by all means, be secured before he had a chance to leave the\r\nseceded States; and inquired as to the situation of the troops in the\r\nSouth and the probability of their defeating an attempt by Davis to\r\nfly through Mexico, or by boat on the Gulf. President Johnson replied\r\nthat no way was open for his escape, but that he would be captured,\r\ndead or alive. The supposition that Davis was implicated in the\r\nassassination plot was then discussed with some difference of opinion,\r\nand finally the President asked General Butler to indicate a plan for\r\nthe prosecution and punishment of Davis and his associates, for the use\r\nof the government. General Butler consented and the conference ended.\r\n\r\nWith the preparation of the memorandum thus requested, General Butler\r\noccupied almost his entire time for several weeks, investigating\r\nprecedents, and examining authorities with the utmost thoroughness.\r\nDuring this work he was repeatedly in consultation with Mr. Chandler,\r\nwho saw all of his notes and made many suggestions; before its\r\ncompletion, Davis had been captured and sent to Fortress Monroe.\r\nGeneral Butler's plan was submitted to President Johnson in the latter\r\npart of May, 1865. It was long and elaborate, was based upon an\r\nexhaustive examination of the history of all military tribunals, and\r\nset forth in substance these propositions:\r\n\r\n1. That Davis could be tried by a military commission, having been\r\ncaptured while in rebellion in a locality where no lawful civil\r\nauthority existed. This tribunal could sit at Fortress Monroe, where\r\nDavis was a prisoner, as that was still within the military lines.\r\n\r\n2. That this commission should be composed of the thirteen officers\r\nof the highest rank in the army; this provision would have made it\r\nconsist of Lieut.-Gen. U. S. Grant; Major-Generals H. W. Halleck, W.\r\nT. Sherman, George G. Meade, Philip H. Sheridan, George H. Thomas, and\r\nBrigadier-Generals Irwin McDowell, Wm. S. Rosecrans, Philip St. George\r\nCooke, John Pope, Joseph Hooker, W. S. Hancock, and John M. Schofield.\r\n\r\n3. That in case of conviction, before the sentence should be executed,\r\nDavis should be allowed an opportunity to appeal to the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States; this would silence criticism, secure Davis all\r\nhis legal rights, and establish a precedent which might stand for all\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n4. That the only doubt that existed as to the conviction of Davis\r\nwas to be found in the question of the jurisdiction of the military\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\n5. That the prosecution should hold Davis's assumption of military\r\nauthority against the United States as the overt act of treason, and\r\nthat his military orders, his commissions of officers, his official\r\nannouncements of himself as \"commander-in-chief of the military and\r\nnaval forces of the Confederate States,\" his official reviews of\r\ntroops, the official reports made to him by commanders of armies in\r\nrebellion, should be proven to establish the case.\r\n\r\n6. That the record of the oaths taken by him as an officer in the\r\nUnited States army, as a Senator, and as Secretary of War, should be\r\nshown with evidence that he had violated them.\r\n\r\n7. That the various acts of cruelty to prisoners of war committed\r\nby his orders should be proven; other minor counts could also be\r\nintroduced in the indictment to secure an accumulation of charges.\r\n\r\nGeneral Butler's memorandum further set forth that the prosecution\r\nshould expect to be met by the defense:\r\n\r\n1. With the question of jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n2. With an attempt to prove the right of secession.\r\n\r\n3. With the claim that the duty of allegiance to a state was superior\r\nto the duty of allegiance to the general government.\r\n\r\n4. With the claim that the acts of which Davis was accused were\r\nperformed by him as the head of a _de facto_ government, to which\r\noffice he had been elected under forms of law.\r\n\r\n5. With the further point that the recognition of this _de facto_\r\ngovernment by the United States in the exchange of prisoners, in the\r\nacceptance of terms of surrender, in the observance of flags of truce,\r\nand in correspondence of various kinds, amounted to such a recognition\r\nof the existence of a government with which it was at war, as must\r\nprevent the United States from claiming that participation therein was\r\ntreason.\r\n\r\nThese were the chief points which General Butler thought the defense\r\nwould set up, and in his brief he grouped a powerful array of\r\nprecedents and decisions upon which the prosecution could rest its\r\ncase and meet these objections. During the early stages of this work,\r\nMr. Chandler, General Butler and others, who firmly held that stern\r\npunishment should be meted out to a few conspicuous rebels--not in a\r\nspirit of vengeance, but from a belief that salutary results would\r\nfollow if it should be established as a historical fact that in the\r\nUnited States treason is a high crime whose penalty is death--were\r\nconstantly anxious lest the President should by some violent act or\r\nword destroy the moral effect of their position. In public he said\r\nrepeatedly at this time that \"the penalties of the law must be in a\r\nstern and inflexible manner executed upon conscious, intelligent and\r\ninfluential traitors,\" but his private utterances far outstripped\r\nthis language, and were often scarcely less than bloodthirsty. Mr.\r\nChandler, on one occasion, came away from the White House greatly\r\ndisturbed by Mr. Johnson's disposition to treat this subject with mere\r\nanger, and characteristically said to Senator Wade and Mr. Hamlin,\r\n\"Johnson has the nightmare, and it is important that he should be\r\nwatched.\" General Butler's memorandum Mr. Chandler heartily approved\r\nas clear in scope, just in spirit, and certain to prove effective in\r\noperation, but, by the time it was fully completed, a great change\r\nhad taken place in the disposition of the President. In April he was\r\nin favor of hanging every body; in June he was opposed to hanging\r\nany one. He finally ignored entirely the memorandum which General\r\nButler had drawn up at his request, and decided that Davis should be\r\ntried by the civil authorities at Richmond, where his crimes had been\r\ncommitted. As a result the arch-rebel was allowed to remain in prison\r\nat Fortress Monroe for nearly two years, because of the lack of a\r\ncivil court competent to take jurisdiction of his case. In 1866 he was\r\nindicted and arraigned, and in 1867 was admitted to bail; a year later\r\na _nolle prosequi_ was entered, and the case against him dismissed.\r\nBefore this matter had reached its second stage even, Mr. Chandler had\r\nbecome convinced that Andrew Johnson had determined to desert the party\r\nwhich had elevated him to the vice-presidency, and with that knowledge\r\nceased to act as his adviser and became one of the most active of his\r\npolitical enemies. The leniency of the course finally pursued toward\r\nDavis Mr. Chandler then and afterward regarded as a grave public\r\nmistake, and believed that the failure to enforce the death penalty\r\nwhere it was so thoroughly deserved was exceedingly unfortunate in its\r\ninfluence upon popular opinion, and did more than any other one cause\r\nto encourage the disloyal classes of the South in their plans for\r\nultimately recapturing the political supremacy they had forfeited by\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nPrecisely the causes which led Andrew Johnson so quickly back into\r\nclose fellowship with the men whom he had regarded as his inveterate\r\nenemies will never be known. It is probable that originally they\r\nwere slight, but his temperament rapidly widened disagreement into\r\nirreconcilable hostility. His maudlin speech on Inauguration-day so\r\nincensed many of his supporters that the Republican senators, at a\r\nformal gathering, actually considered a proposition (urged by Mr.\r\nSumner) to request him to resign the office he had disgraced. The\r\nconference decided against such a step, but Mr. Johnson heard of the\r\nmovement, and regarded those who approved it with much bitterness;\r\nhis hatred of them undoubtedly fed his growing dislike for the party\r\nof which they were influential leaders. Again, he was a thorough\r\nrepresentative of the \"poor whites\" of the South. He felt their\r\njealousy of the planting aristocracy which monopolized political power\r\nin his section, and this made him such a vigorous opponent of the\r\nsecession conspiracy which that oligarchy organized and led. But he\r\nalso shared in the prejudice of his own class against the negroes,\r\nand, when he saw the disposition of the Republicans to accord to the\r\nfreedmen equal rights and privileges before the law, he refused to\r\njoin in that movement and set doggedly about defeating such plans.\r\nPrecisely how great Mr. Seward's influence over him was at this time\r\nis not clear, but it is certain that the change in his attitude toward\r\nRepublicanism was simultaneous with the slow recovery of his Secretary\r\nof State from the blows of Payne's dagger. His combative obstinacy also\r\nmade him fiercely resent the vigorous criticisms which his \"policy\"\r\nof reconstruction invited when first announced; Congress did not meet\r\nfor months after his accession to the presidency, and its leaders were\r\nnot in position to check his course, either by organized remonstrance\r\nor by legislative interposition; the rebels who had been denouncing\r\nhim savagely were prompt to flatter his vanity and to offer promises\r\nof support; and, as a result, when the Thirty-ninth Congress met on\r\nDecember 4, 1865, the break between the President and the Republican\r\nparty had passed beyond mending. Mr. Johnson entered at once upon\r\nthat shameful course, which included the betrayal of those who had\r\ntrusted him and the disgrace of his high office by lamentable public\r\nexhibitions of passion and boorishness, and which led to great and\r\ndurable public injury by trebling the difficulties surrounding the\r\ndelicate and important work of reconstructing the \"Confederacy.\" Mr.\r\nChandler's distrust of the President commenced with his change of tone\r\nin regard to the punishment of treason and with the first manifestation\r\nof his intention to assume full control of reconstruction and to\r\npractically restore the rebels to power in the subdued States. They\r\nhad one stormy interview at the White House, in which Mr. Chandler,\r\nafter touching upon the implicit character of his confidence in the\r\nPresident during their senatorial service, denounced his new course as\r\na violation of his sacred pledges and a base surrender to traitors, and\r\nleft him indignantly and forever. From that time he regarded Andrew\r\nJohnson as a public enemy, whose opportunities for evil were to be\r\nlessened by every possible lawful restriction. He did not oppose the\r\nefforts made by his more hopeful associates in December, 1865, to\r\nre-establish harmony between the Capitol and the White House, but he\r\npredicted their failure. All the legislation which diminished Johnson's\r\npower for harm he ardently supported. The bills to admit Nebraska and\r\nColorado (the Colorado bill failed at this time) he was especially\r\nactive in pushing, from a belief that it was important to increase the\r\nRepublican ascendency in the Senate while there was an uncertainty as\r\nto how much strength the \"Johnson men\" proper (Senators Doolittle,\r\nDixon, Norton, and Cowan) might develop. It was largely through Mr.\r\nChandler's untiring exertions, also, that the Fortieth Senate elected\r\nBenjamin F. Wade as its President, and thus made him the acting\r\nVice-President of the United States, a position of the very highest\r\nresponsibility in the then critical state of national affairs.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler aided in shaping and passing the reconstruction measures\r\nof 1866-'67-'68, not for the reason that they precisely embodied his\r\nideas of the true method to be pursued, but because they presented a\r\nplan upon which the Republicans could be united, which was practicable,\r\nand which promised to reorganize the Southern States on the basis of\r\nthe supremacy of the loyal elements in their population. When Andrew\r\nJohnson took the first step in unfolding his \"policy\" (by his general\r\namnesty proclamation and by the appointment of a provisional governor\r\nfor North Carolina, both acts bearing the date of May 29, 1865) the\r\n\"Confederacy\" had ceased to exist, its chieftain was a captive, its\r\narmies were prisoners of war on parole, its capacity for resistance had\r\nbeen consumed in the furnace of battle, but its bitterness still glowed\r\nand the prejudices and ambitions which gave it being were undestroyed.\r\nThe amnesty proclamation relieved, with a few exceptions, those who\r\nbore arms against the government and the most virulent supporters of\r\nrebellion who remained at home from all pains and penalties on the sole\r\ncondition that they should subscribe to an oath of future loyalty.\r\nThe provisional government proclamations permitted all persons thus\r\namnestied, who were voters according to laws of the States previous\r\nto the rebellion, to elect delegates to conventions to amend the\r\nlocal constitutions and restore the States to their \"constitutional\r\nrelations with the federal government.\" By this process the loyal\r\ncolored men of the South were denied the right to participate in the\r\nwork of reconstruction and the entire machinery of reorganization was\r\nplaced in the control of men whose hands were yet red with Union blood.\r\nTheir discretion was only hampered by three conditions, compliance\r\nwith which was made essential to the presidential approval of their\r\nwork. They were required to annul the secession ordinances, to formally\r\nrecognize the abolition of slavery, and to repudiate all debts created\r\nto promote rebellion. Beyond this, the disloyal classes of the South\r\nwere left in undisputed mastery of the situation. The control of the\r\ninsurgent States, and of the lives and fortunes of the loyalists,\r\nwhite and black, were surrendered absolutely to the men who but a few\r\nweeks before had been wrecked in the catastrophe which overwhelmed the\r\nrebellion. That they were prompt to improve this unexpected, undeserved\r\nand mistaken leniency need not be said. Their use of their new power\r\nwas both presumptuous and intolerant. In elections, which proscribed\r\nUnion men as unworthy of trust, conventions were chosen which accepted\r\nungraciously the mere fact of emancipation, and which repudiated\r\nthe rebel debts only under repeated presidential compulsion. State\r\ngovernments were then organized, which placed men whose disloyalty had\r\nbeen conspicuous in responsible positions, and which sent unamnestied\r\nleaders of the rebellion in the field and in council to Washington as\r\nclaimants of Congressional seats. The State legislation which followed\r\nembodied in shameful laws the unquenched diabolism of the slave power.\r\nIn statutory phraseology these enactments declared, \"politically and\r\nsocially this is a white man's government,\" and, impudently asserting\r\nthat Congress was without any power over the matter, the men who had,\r\nin form, admitted the death of slavery proceeded to establish peonage\r\nin its stead. No body of laws adopted by any civilized nation in\r\nthis century has equaled in studied injustice and cruelty those by\r\nwhich the \"Johnson governments\" of 1865 and 1866 sought to prevent\r\nthe freedmen from rising from the level of admitted and hopeless\r\ninferiority, and to convince the blacks that in ceasing to be slaves\r\nthey had only become serfs. Colored people were denied the right to\r\nacquire or dispose of public property. It was made a crime for a negro\r\nto enter a plantation without the consent of its owner or agent.\r\nFreedmen were declared vagrants, and punished as such for preaching\r\nthe gospel without a license from some regularly organized church.\r\nColored men failing to pay capitation tax were declared vagrants and\r\nthe sale of their services was permitted as a penalty. Black persons\r\nwere prohibited from renting or leasing lands except in incorporated\r\ntowns or villages. Their owning or bearing arms was declared to be a\r\nviolation of the peace. For a negro to break a labor contract was made\r\nan offense punishable by imprisonment. Colored laborers on farms were\r\nprohibited from selling poultry or farm products, and it was made a\r\nmisdemeanor to purchase from them. This class was also denied the right\r\nof forming part of the militia, and it was made an offense for any\r\nfreedman to enter a religious or other assembly of whites, or go with\r\nthem into any rail car or public conveyance. White persons \"usually\r\nassociating themselves with freedmen, free negroes, or mulattoes\"\r\nwere also declared to be vagrants in the eye of the law. The colored\r\npeople were prohibited from practicing any art, trade or business\r\nexcept husbandry, without special license from the courts. And most\r\ninfamous of all were the statutes for the compulsory apprenticeship\r\nof colored children with or without the consent of parents, which\r\npractically re-established over the next generation of the freed people\r\nslavery with the whipping-post and overseer's lash. One State by joint\r\nresolution tendered thanks to Jefferson Davis \"for the noble and\r\npatriotic manner in which he conducted the affairs of _our_ government\r\nwhile President of the Confederacy,\" and other resolutions were adopted\r\ndeclaring that \"nothing more is required for the restoration of law\r\nand order but the withdrawal of federal bayonets.\" [The fell spirit\r\nand tendency of the reaction which was thus revealed found still more\r\nsignificant expression in the revolting butchery in and around the\r\nMechanic's Institute of New Orleans on the 30th of July, 1866.] Some\r\nof these infamous measures were adopted in all the insurrectionary\r\nStates, others in only some of them, but without exception the new\r\nSouthern governments which Andrew Johnson's \"policy\" created were\r\nfounded upon the traditions of the slave system and the memories of\r\n\"the lost cause.\" The objection that the President had, in thus taking\r\nthe work of reconstruction into his own hands, usurped authority\r\ndevolved upon Congress by the constitution, was a strong one, but it\r\nreceived but little popular attention. Anger at the results of that\r\n\"policy\" obscured the mere disapproval of its methods. When it was seen\r\nthat the rebellion had merely changed its theater of action, and that\r\nwhat it lost on the battle-field it proposed to secure by legislation,\r\nthere was but one opinion among the masses of the people who had\r\nheartily supported the war and were sincerely anxious to preserve its\r\nfruits. Their emphatic demand was that the illegal and reactionary\r\ngovernments set up by the President should be overturned, and the South\r\nreconstructed in the interests of loyalty and liberty. Congress, as\r\npart of its stubborn contest with Andrew Johnson, undertook this work.\r\nIt refused to recognize the pretended State governments or to admit\r\ntheir Congressmen. It divided the territory of the conquered States\r\ninto five military districts, and placed it under the control of the\r\narmy until a juster system of reconstruction could be applied. It then\r\nprovided that in the calling of conventions to frame new constitutions\r\ncolored men should be permitted to vote; that those revised instruments\r\nmust confer the elective franchise upon all loyal colored people\r\nand all whites not disfranchised for rebellion; that the work of\r\nthe conventions must be submitted to the colored and white people\r\nnot disfranchised for approval; that the Thirteenth and Fourteenth\r\nAmendments to the national constitution must be ratified; and that\r\nthe State constitutions so adopted must be submitted to and accepted\r\nby Congress. Upon this general plan the South was reconstructed, not\r\nwithout much friction, not wholly to the satisfaction of the men who\r\nmarked out this course of procedure, but with the faith (or at least\r\nthe trust) on their part that it would restore that section to the\r\nUnion with genuinely free institutions, that it would protect the\r\nemancipated slave in his rights, and that it would substitute for\r\ndisloyal communities States controlled by those whose interests and\r\ntraditions lay with the national cause. The reconstruction laws were\r\nnot vengeful in character; the aim of the men who passed them was not\r\nretaliation, not even retribution except in so far as the application\r\nof mild penalties to treason might increase the security of the future.\r\nTo prevent a repetition of the terrible struggle which had just closed\r\nwas the aim; that a political system had been devised, which both\r\nrecognized human rights, and by its natural operations would exclude\r\nfrom political power the men who had plunged the country into civil\r\nwar, was the hope. Within ten years the scheme failed utterly, and what\r\nit was designed to prevent had been accomplished upon its ruins. No\r\nbody of laws can maintain itself in the face of organized murder and\r\nterrorism which authority refuses to either punish or prevent.\r\n\r\nThe reconstruction measures, while they commanded Mr. Chandler's\r\ngeneral assent, were laxer in details than he would have made them.\r\nHe felt, as Thaddeus Stevens said, that much that they ought to\r\nhave contained was \"defeated by the united forces of self-righteous\r\nRepublicans and unrighteous Copperheads,\" but held that the bills\r\nwhich were passed deserved support as a whole on the ground that it\r\nwas not wise to \"throw away a great good because it is not perfect.\"\r\nSchuyler Colfax closed one of his speeches upon this subject as\r\nfollows: \"Loyalty must govern what loyalty preserved.\" Mr. Chandler\r\ncomplimented him warmly and said, \"You got it all into one sentence,\"\r\nand that doctrine and the belief in equal rights for citizens of\r\nevery color guided his share of the work upon all measures affecting\r\nreconstruction. His chief regret was that the process of this\r\nreorganization was not prolonged until the loyal sentiment of the South\r\nhad become strong enough and intelligent enough to maintain itself. If\r\nhis wishes had prevailed, the provisional governing of that section\r\nwould have been continued until the education of the blacks, the death\r\nof the rebel leaders, and the extinguishment by time of the prejudices\r\nand animosities of the war had accomplished such a wholesome revolution\r\nin sentiment throughout that section as would in itself have been a\r\nloyal and durable reconstruction. As this was not possible, he spared\r\nno effort to make successful the experiment which was attempted; if\r\nothers had been as resolute and faithful as he, it would not have\r\nfailed. He did not share in the disposition of so many Republicans to\r\nabandon what had been just commenced because of the imperfection of its\r\nfirst fruits. He stood manfully for the maintenance by Northern opinion\r\nand by the aid of the United States of the loyal State governments\r\nof the South, not claiming they were faultless, but because they\r\nwere based on justice and were far better than that which would take\r\ntheir place if they fell. When they were assailed by assassination,\r\nby massacre, and by systematic terrorizing, he believed that it was\r\nthe duty of the general government to use all its authority and all\r\nits force to protect its citizens in their rights and to prevent the\r\nharvesting by unpunished traitors of the fruits of atrocities as\r\nbrutal and bloody as Saint Bartholomew. The policy of political murder\r\ntriumphed finally at the South, not through any weakness of such men as\r\nhe, nor through any failure upon his part to denounce that vast crime.\r\nHe labored strenuously to kindle Northern opinion into such a flame\r\nof just wrath as would have made impossible that victory of organized\r\nbrutality.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler, was often described by political opponents as \"the\r\nrelentless enemy of the South;\" nothing was farther from the fact.\r\nThat small minority of the Southern people, who ruled that section\r\nwith oligarchical power before and during the war, who organized and\r\nled the rebellion, and who have now regained supremacy by outrage and\r\nmurder, he always distrusted and attacked. But the great majority of\r\nthe people of the South--the blacks whom those men rob of their rights\r\nand the whites whom they mislead--he profoundly pitied, and their\r\ncause he espoused. For them he demanded equal rights before the law, a\r\nfree ballot box, the common school, and an opportunity to prove their\r\nmanhood. Those who resisted a policy so just and civilizing he was\r\nquick to denounce in unstinted terms, and upon them he did not waste\r\nconciliation. They--not \"the South\"--found him the inappeasable, but\r\nstill \"the avowed, the erect, the manly foe.\"\r\n\r\nIn the elections of 1866 the issues were chiefly those connected with\r\nreconstruction, and Mr. Chandler as usual spoke in his own and other\r\nWestern States, exposing the malign results of Mr. Johnson's \"policy\"\r\nand in advocacy of the Congressional plan and the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nThe general tenor of his speeches will appear from this extract from an\r\naddress delivered at Detroit, at the close of the political campaign:\r\n\r\n  These perjured traitors are permitted to live here, but we say\r\n  to them they can never again hold office unless Congress by a\r\n  two-thirds vote shall remove the disability; why, a man who has\r\n  committed perjury alone, right here in Michigan, you would not\r\n  allow to testify before a justice of the peace in the most petty\r\n  case. But we forget the perjury of the rebels which would send them\r\n  to the State prison, we forget the hanging which follows treason,\r\n  and say to them simply, that for the future they can never hold\r\n  office. Personally I am not in favor of the last clause of this\r\n  section which gives Congress the power to remove this disability by\r\n  a two-thirds vote. I would have let this race of perjured traitors\r\n  die out, out of office, and educate the rising generation to\r\n  loyalty. But it is in the amendment and I advocate its adoption as\r\n  it is.\r\n\r\nOften during the progress of the obstinate struggle between Andrew\r\nJohnson and Congress his attempts to evade law and his encroachments\r\nupon the powers vested in the legislative branch of the government led\r\nto the serious consideration in the House of Representatives of the\r\nquestion of impeachment. Several resolutions ordering the preferring\r\nof charges against him at the bar of the Senate were presented without\r\naction, but on the 7th of January, 1867, the Hon. J. M. Ashley of\r\nOhio offered a preamble, beginning, \"I do impeach Andrew Johnson,\r\nVice-President and acting President of the United States, of high\r\ncrimes and misdemeanors. I charge him with usurpation of power and\r\nviolation of law in that he has corruptly used the appointing\r\npower; ... corruptly used the pardoning power; ... corruptly used\r\nthe veto power; ... corruptly disposed of public property; ... and\r\ncorruptly interfered in elections.\" With this preamble was a resolution\r\nreferring the charges to the Judiciary Committee to inquire if the\r\nPresident had been guilty of acts which were \"calculated to overthrow,\r\nsubvert or corrupt the government.\" By a vote of 108 yeas to 39 nays\r\nthis reference was ordered, but no report was made until November\r\n25, 1867, and then a resolution of impeachment was submitted by Mr.\r\nBoutwell in behalf of the majority of the committee. On December 7,\r\nthis resolution was rejected by a vote of 57 to 108. Encouraged by\r\nthis result Mr. Johnson, who had suspended Edwin M. Stanton from the\r\nSecretaryship of War during the Congressional recess of 1867, and whose\r\naction had been disapproved by the Senate under the Tenure of Civil\r\nOffice act, undertook to force Mr. Stanton out by a second suspension\r\non February 21, 1868, accompanied by an order appointing Gen. Lorenzo\r\nThomas Secretary _ad interim_. Mr. Stanton declined to acknowledge the\r\nPresident's power to take this step, refused to give place to General\r\nThomas, and for many days and nights remained in constant occupation\r\nof the department offices. The House of Representatives at once\r\narraigned the President before the Senate for this attempted violation\r\nof the Tenure of Office act, and his trial followed. Chief Justice\r\nChase presided; the proceedings lasted from February 25 until May 26,\r\n1868; and in the end Mr. Johnson was acquitted, exactly the number of\r\nRepublican Senators necessary to defeat conviction voting with the\r\nDemocratic minority. These proceedings Mr. Chandler watched with the\r\nliveliest interest, and the failure of the impeachment was one of\r\nthe most bitter disappointments of his political career. He sincerely\r\nbelieved that Johnson's course fully merited a verdict of \"guilty,\"\r\nand he felt that the great difficulties surrounding the problem of the\r\nloyal reconstruction of the South would disappear if the executive\r\ndepartment of the government was administered with the Jacksonian vigor\r\nand patriotism of Benjamin F. Wade. Mr. Stanton's refusal to permit the\r\nPresident to displace him without the consent of the Senate he endorsed\r\nwith the utmost heartiness, and, while the Secretary remained in his\r\noffice to prevent its seizure by Mr. Johnson's _ad interim_ appointee,\r\nMr. Chandler spent night after night with him, and did all that was\r\npossible to strengthen his resolution and to lighten his voluntary\r\nconfinement. On one occasion, when there were signs of an intention on\r\nthe part of the claimant to use force, Mr. Chandler, General Logan,\r\nand a few others gathered together about a hundred trusty men, who\r\noccupied the basement of the department, and there did garrison duty\r\nuntil the danger was past. During Johnson's trial Mr. Chandler was not\r\nforgetful of his position as a judge, and was an attentive listener to\r\nthe evidence and the arguments before and in the court of impeachment.\r\nHe was restive under the length of the proceedings, however, and did\r\nadvise the managers on the part of the House to push the case along\r\nas rapidly as possible, urging that the public interest required the\r\nending of the general suspense. He felt then, and said afterward, that\r\nthe delay was used to effect combinations with, and apply pressure to,\r\nindividual Senators, which would induce them to favor acquittal. That\r\nthis was done he never doubted, and he repeatedly denounced in the\r\nstrongest terms, both in public and private, the action of the seven\r\nRepublicans (Senators Fessenden, Trumbull, Grimes, Henderson, Fowler,\r\nRoss and Van Winkle) who voted \"not guilty\" with the Democrats and\r\nthe \"Johnson men.\" He was especially indignant at the course of Mr.\r\nFessenden and Mr. Trumbull, and on several occasions in after years\r\ncame into sharp personal collision with them during the Senate debates.\r\nThe final failure of the impeachment movement he felt as a blow. One\r\nwho knew him well has said: \"He believed that republican government was\r\nat stake and impeachment a necessity. Never was there a time when he\r\ncame so near despairing of the republic as at that event.\"\r\n\r\nThe Thirty-ninth and Fortieth Congresses remained in nearly continuous\r\nsession for over three years \"watching the White House.\" Outside of\r\nthe exciting political topics which received so large a share of their\r\nattention, they were compelled to deal with important financial,\r\ncommercial and material questions affecting vitally the general\r\ninterest. The currency and public debt demanded simplification; the tax\r\nsystem was to be changed from a war to a peace footing; the commercial\r\nwrecks of many years called for a bankrupt law; bounties were to be\r\nequalized, pensions provided, and war claims adjusted on wise bases;\r\nneglected internal improvements clamored for renovation and extension;\r\nthe ocean commerce required national care; and innumerable minor\r\ninterests, long neglected under the stress of civil war, needed instant\r\nattention. Mr. Chandler worked with characteristic energy and practical\r\nwisdom in all these branches of legislative activity, and rendered\r\npublic services of varied and permanent usefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENCY OF GENERAL GRANT--THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the presidential election of 1868 Mr. Chandler was even more than\r\nusually active, both as an organizer and speaker. He delivered nearly\r\nforty addresses in his own State, which gave to the Grant and Colfax\r\nticket 31,492 majority, and elected a Republican Congressman in each\r\nof its six districts. The Legislature chosen at the same time had 66\r\nRepublican majority upon joint ballot, and re-elected Mr. Chandler\r\nfor his third Senatorial term, the Democratic vote being cast for the\r\nHon. Sanford M. Green of Bay City. In the Republican caucus there\r\nwas practically no opposition to Mr. Chandler's renomination, and\r\nhe received on the first and only ballot 78 votes, 13 other ballots\r\nbeing cast for seven gentlemen by way of personal compliment. The\r\ninauguration of President Grant, on March 4, 1869, renewed Mr.\r\nChandler's influence with the executive branch of the government, and\r\nthe political and personal friendship between him and the modest,\r\nresolute, and illustrious soldier who succeeded Andrew Johnson grew\r\nmutually stronger and more appreciative from that day.\r\n\r\nVery much of the legislation of President Grant's first term, which\r\nreceived Mr. Chandler's vigilant attention and absorbed no small share\r\nof his energy, related to the details of the public business, and\r\nfurnishes no biographical material of permanent interest. He supported\r\nthe Fifteenth Amendment in all its stages, and also the Civil Rights\r\nbills, which he regarded as incomplete, but still as the taking of\r\nsteps in the direction of justice.[34] It was his firm purpose to\r\ncontribute his share toward making American citizenship mean something,\r\nfor both black and white, and, if life was spared, to cease not his\r\nlabors until the humblest freeman in the United States should be in\r\nfirm possession of every natural and constitutional right, should have\r\nfree access to an honest ballot-box, should suffer no proscription for\r\nhis political opinions, and should be amply protected in his liberty to\r\nthink, say, go, and do as he pleased within the limitations laid down\r\nby law for the regulation of the conduct of all. The battle, in which\r\nhe was so eager and stalwart a leader, will not be finished until that\r\nresult is forever secured.\r\n\r\nEarly in General Grant's term the friends of Edwin M. Stanton\r\ndetermined to secure for him such an official appointment as should be\r\ncongenial to his tastes and guarantee him an adequate support in old\r\nage. His iron constitution resisted the enormous labors of the civil\r\nwar successfully. For many months he worked from fifteen to twenty\r\nhours in each day; his assistant secretaries were energetic and trained\r\nmen of affairs, but their strength successively gave way in attempting\r\nto keep up with their chief. When the strain was finally withdrawn, it\r\nwas perceived that his own powers were greatly exhausted. Rest restored\r\ntheir tone somewhat, and he made one or two legal arguments and public\r\naddresses, which showed that his intellectual vigor was undiminished,\r\nbut these efforts were followed by extreme nervous prostration. Under\r\nthese circumstances, Mr. Stanton's friends determined to secure for\r\nhim a judicial appointment. For such a position he was qualified by\r\neminent professional attainments, and this fact and the permanency\r\nof tenure made the tender of a place upon the bench grateful to him.\r\nAccordingly, when Judge Grier resigned his position as a member of\r\nthe Supreme Court, Mr. Stanton's appointment to the vacant Associate\r\nJusticeship was at once urged upon President Grant. Mr. Chandler was\r\nvery active in this matter and pressed it with all his energy. The\r\neffort was successful, and on Dec. 20, 1869, this nomination was sent\r\nto the Senate and promptly confirmed. Four days afterward, and before\r\nhis commission was made out, Mr. Stanton's overtaxed constitution\r\nbroke down, and he died after a brief illness, in the fifty-fifth\r\nyear of his age, as thorough a sacrifice to the nobility of his own\r\npatriotic devotion during the war as the bravest soldier who fell on\r\nany of its battle-fields. During his fatal illness, Mr. Chandler was a\r\nfrequent watcher at his bedside, and was one of the last persons with\r\nwhom the dying statesman conversed. After his death it was found that\r\nthe man who had controlled the disbursement of hundreds of millions\r\nhad died poor, and had not left an estate adequate to the support of\r\nhis children. Congress directed a year's salary of a Justice of the\r\nSupreme Court to be paid to his heirs. Mr. Chandler and others of his\r\nfriends also set on foot a movement to raise a national memorial fund.\r\nA meeting of Republicans was called at the residence of Congressman\r\nSamuel Hooper of Massachusetts, and a committee was there appointed\r\nwho collected over $140,000 (Mr. Chandler contributing $10,000 and\r\nPresident Grant $1,000), which was invested in United States bonds and\r\nplaced in the hands of a few trustees, of whom Surgeon-General Barnes\r\nof the army was chairman, for the benefit of the Stanton family.\r\n\r\nDuring General Grant's term the subject of \"war claims\" commenced to\r\nattract national attention. Originally the Republican Congresses dealt\r\nliberally with the South in the matter of compensation for damages\r\ninflicted upon its loyal citizens during the rebellion. By a series of\r\ncarefully-guarded laws (and by a few private relief measures passed to\r\nmeet exceptional cases) a large sum was paid to residents of the rebel\r\nStates who suffered war losses, and were able to produce satisfactory\r\nproof of their fidelity to the Union. In this matter the national\r\ngovernment certainly went to the extreme verge of generosity. The\r\nexperience attending the disbursement of the money thus appropriated\r\nestablished conclusively the fraudulent and outrageous character of a\r\nlarge percentage of these claims. In thousands of cases investigation\r\nshowed conclusively that arrant rebels were willing to swear that they\r\nhad been \"Union men,\" and that small losses had, by false affidavits,\r\nbeen magnified into great sums. As reconstruction broke down, and\r\nthe survivors of the rebellion gained in strength at the Capitol, a\r\nnew danger arose. No statute of limitations barred the indefinite\r\npresentation of claims to Congress, and it soon became evident that,\r\nnot merely Southern loyalists, but avowed rebels who suffered losses\r\nin the war were looking to the general government for compensation\r\nfor the damages which their own treason had invited. The movement on\r\nthe Treasury in their interest did not take on the form of an attack\r\nin front, but by the flank. It commenced with plausible applications\r\nfor the \"relief\" of Southern institutions and corporations, and not\r\nof individuals. It further manifested itself in propositions for such\r\na relaxation of the terms of the laws and regulations governing this\r\nclass of claims as would abolish all distinctions of \"loyalty\" and put\r\nthe \"Confederate\" upon an equal footing with the Union applicant for\r\nthis kind of \"relief.\" The precise dimensions of this scheme, which\r\nhas been well characterized as \"an attempt to make the United States\r\npay to the South what it cost it to be conquered in addition to what\r\nit cost to conquer it,\" have not yet fully appeared, but the cloven\r\nhoof has been sufficiently revealed to justly arouse and alarm the\r\nloyal sentiment of the North. Mr. Chandler's record upon this question\r\naffords a striking illustration of the soundness of his judgment as to\r\nthe scope and tendency of any particular line of public policy. When\r\nthis subject first demanded attention, he took the position which his\r\nparty substantially assumed ten years later. His clear and practical\r\nmind saw what the consequences would be of any general reimbursement of\r\nwar losses, and he strenuously resisted the taking of any false steps\r\nat the outset. Thus, on March 2, 1865, upon the bill to pay Josiah O.\r\nArmes for the destruction of property within the rebel lines, he said\r\nin the Senate:\r\n\r\n  I hope this bill will not pass the Senate.... If you pass it, if\r\n  you set this precedent, if you say to every rebel and every loyal\r\n  man, and every man throughout the South, by the passage of this\r\n  bill, that you intend to pay for every dollar of property that has\r\n  been destroyed by order of our generals, you will give a more fatal\r\n  blow to the credit of the government than by any other act that you\r\n  can perform in this body. I should look upon the passage of this\r\n  bill as a national calamity, and one that we cannot afford at this\r\n  time to bring on our heads. It will do more to shake the faith of\r\n  our own citizens and of the moneyed centers of the world in the\r\n  credit of your securities than any other act you could perform.\r\n\r\nIn his address before the Republican caucus which renominated him for\r\nthe Senate in January, 1869, he also said:\r\n\r\n  The moment this government begins to allow claims for damages\r\n  accruing to individuals during the war in the South, it is placed\r\n  in a position of great peril. Every rebel in the South who lost a\r\n  haystack or barn by fire during the war will prove his loyalty and\r\n  secure damages. It requires the greatest vigilance to prevent some\r\n  of these claims from being allowed, as they are continually being\r\n  pressed upon Congress, and probably will be for many years. The\r\n  laws of war do not require nor justify the allowance of this class\r\n  of claims even to loyal men. If they are loyal, then they have\r\n  served the government, and that is compensation enough. If they are\r\n  disloyal, they have no claim.\r\n\r\nThese quotations indicate his original position on this issue, taken in\r\nthe days when it had received but the slightest public attention. They\r\nare exactly in the line of the vigorous utterances upon the same topic\r\nwhich formed one of the important features of his public addresses in\r\n1879, when the subject had aroused marked popular interest, and other\r\nleaders had stepped up to the platform he had so long occupied.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Chandler did more than strenuously oppose the payment of the\r\n\"war claims\" of Southern disloyalists; his farsightedness placed in\r\ntheir path a serious practical obstacle. In 1873, a Colonel Pickett,\r\nwho had been confidentially connected with the War Department of\r\nthe \"Confederacy,\" came to Washington and offered to sell to the\r\nauthorities a vast quantity of the archives of the rebel government,\r\nwhich he had secreted before the capture of Richmond. Congress was\r\nnot in session, and the Secretary of War, having no authority in law,\r\nrefused to buy the documents. Mr. Chandler was in that city at the\r\ntime, and Pickett was referred to him as a man of means and as one who\r\nwould be apt to appreciate the importance of such a purchase. After\r\none or two calls, Mr. Chandler determined that the matter deserved\r\ninvestigation at least. He asked for a schedule of the documents and\r\nfor a statement of their prices. Pickett promptly furnished the former\r\nand offered to sell them for $250,000. Mr. Chandler, after a careful\r\nexamination of the schedule, replied with a proposition that, if the\r\npapers corresponded with the list furnished, he would pay $75,000 for\r\nthem. This offer was at last accepted, and Mr. Chandler deposited that\r\nsum in a Washington bank, subject to Pickett's order after a thorough\r\nexamination of the documents had been made. Confidential clerks\r\nwere at once set at work upon them, and it was found that they even\r\nsurpassed their owner's representations as to value. The purchase was\r\ntherefore completed, and the documents became the private property\r\nof Mr. Chandler, who had them locked up in a vault. When Congress\r\nmet, a bill was passed authorizing the Secretary of War in general\r\nterms to purchase the archives of the Confederate government if it\r\nwas ever possible, and appropriating $75,000 for this purpose. As\r\nsoon as the bill became a law Mr. Chandler transferred the documents\r\nto the Secretary of War, and they are now in the possession of that\r\ndepartment and constitute one of the most valuable and useful features\r\nof its record of the rebellion. The amount that has been saved to the\r\ngovernment by this purchase, in furnishing evidence to defeat rebel\r\nclaims, already exceeds many-fold the original price. Case after case\r\nin the Quartermaster-General's office, before the Southern Claims\r\nCommission, and before the Court of Claims has been defeated by\r\nevidence found among these papers.[35] One single conspicuous instance\r\nin which they saved to the Treasury more than four times their entire\r\ncost attracted much deserved attention at the time. On Nov. 16, 1877,\r\nan effort was made by leading Southern Democrats in the House of\r\nRepresentatives to pass under a suspension of the rules, and without\r\ndebate, a joint resolution, ordering the immediate payment of several\r\nhundred thousand dollars to mail contractors in the rebel States who\r\nforfeited their contracts at the commencement of the rebellion. An\r\nobjection from the Hon. Omar D. Conger prevented action on that day,\r\nbut the resolution came up again on Feb. 15, 1878. Representative John\r\nH. Reagan of Texas, who had been the Postmaster-General of the rebel\r\nCabinet, then took charge of the measure, and assured the House that\r\nthe resolution was a purely formal matter, that it only provided for\r\nthe payment of liabilities incurred before the war commenced, and that\r\nthe rebel government had never paid these men for the same services.\r\nThe Hon. Edwin Willits of Michigan, by a timely examination of the\r\nphraseology of the resolution, discovered that it provided for the\r\npayment of these contractors, not down to the actual beginning of\r\nthe rebellion, but until May 31st, 1861, many weeks after the rebel\r\ngovernment had been formed and after the firing upon Fort Sumter.\r\nCalling attention to this fact, he obtained the further postponement of\r\nthe consideration of the resolution. When it came up again (on March\r\n8, 1878) Mr. Willits came to the House armed with a volume of the\r\nrebel statutes and with important extracts from documents contained\r\nin the rebel archives. With this evidence he demonstrated in ten\r\nminutes' time, beyond question, that the rebel government had assumed\r\nthe payment of this class of claims, that it confiscated United States\r\nmoney and applied it to that purpose, that the men so paid agreed\r\nto refund to the rebel treasury any money subsequently given them\r\non this account by the United States, and that the joint resolution\r\nwas but an attempt to pay a second time contracts already paid and\r\nalso properly declared forfeited through treason. The scene attendant\r\nupon this _expose_ was a dramatic one, and it resulted in the virtual\r\nabandonment then of the measure by those who were responsible for it.\r\nThis result would not have been possible, had not the rebel archives\r\nthus opportunely yielded up their secrets. Their possession by the\r\ngovernment is undoubtedly worth millions to the Treasury.\r\n\r\nIn 1871, the second term of Jacob M. Howard, as Senator from\r\nMichigan, expired, and Thomas W. Ferry, then a member of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, was chosen as his successor. With his new colleague\r\nMr. Chandler's relations were always close and cordial, and upon the\r\nquestions of reconstruction, equal rights, and the national supremacy\r\ntheir accord was complete. Mr. Ferry rapidly attained distinction in\r\nthe upper branch of Congress, and was for several successive years the\r\nPresident _pro tempore_ of the Senate. The death of Vice-President\r\nWilson in 1875 made him Acting Vice-President of the United States,\r\nand he held that responsible position throughout the trying weeks of\r\nthe electoral dispute of 1876-'7, when his good sense, the perfect\r\ndiscretion of his course, and the dignity and impartiality with which\r\nhe discharged duties of the gravest character amid vast and dangerous\r\nexcitement, both deserved and received universal praise. Mr. Ferry was\r\nre-elected during this critical period, and, as Mr. Chandler's term as\r\nSecretary of the Interior was then about to close, it was suggested\r\nin some quarters that Michigan should send him back to the Senate in\r\nMr. Ferry's stead. The quality of Mr. Chandler's fidelity as a friend\r\nand of his estimate of Mr. Ferry's public usefulness were shown in the\r\nfact that, anxious as he avowedly was to become again a Senator, these\r\nsuggestions obtained from him only peremptory negatives, and his advice\r\nand influence contributed to Mr. Ferry's unopposed re-election. Mr.\r\nHoward died suddenly at Detroit from apoplexy shortly after the close\r\nof his Senatorial service. As further illustrating the nature of the\r\nfriendship existing between him and his colleague from Michigan, and\r\nthe estimation in which he was held by the eminent men with whom he\r\ncame in contact, this private letter from Mr. Chandler to President\r\nGrant, with an endorsement made thereon by the latter, is here given:\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, Sept. 21, 1870.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR: Secretary Cox has done my colleague an unintentional\r\n  but a serious injury.\r\n\r\n  In 1869 the whole Michigan delegation united in recommending the\r\n  Rev. W. H. Brockway, one of the most popular Methodist clergymen in\r\n  the State, for Indian Agent.\r\n\r\n  He was nominated and confirmed, but acquiesced in the transfer\r\n  of Indian affairs to the military. Since the adjournment of\r\n  Congress, my colleague made a personal request to the Secretary\r\n  of the Interior, that the Rev. Mr. Brockway be commissioned as\r\n  Indian Agent for Michigan. Instead of sending the commission, he\r\n  has sent a man from New Jersey to attend to our Indian affairs.\r\n  This has given offense to the most numerous and powerful religious\r\n  denomination in the State and seriously injured my colleague. I ask\r\n  for my colleague that the New Jersey commission may be immediately\r\n  revoked, and Mr. Brockway may be at once commissioned....\r\n\r\n  It is really important that this be done at once. Very\r\n  respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                                            Z. CHANDLER.\r\n\r\n  _To President U. S. Grant._\r\n\r\n  AUTOGRAPHIC ENDORSEMENT BY PRESIDENT GRANT.\r\n\r\n  Referred to the Secretary of the Interior.\r\n\r\n  I think Mr. Brockway might with great propriety be assigned to the\r\n  Indian agency in his own State, to which he has once been appointed\r\n  and confirmed.\r\n\r\n  He is a minister, and therefore the new rule adopted will not be\r\n  violated by his appointment.\r\n\r\n  I want, besides, to accommodate Senator Howard, whom I regard as an\r\n  able supporter of the Republican party and of the Administration.\r\n\r\n  Sept. 22, 1870.                                            U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler was a member of one or two of the special Congressional\r\ncommittees appointed to investigate those atrocious political murders\r\nwhich made infamous the return of the disloyal classes to power in the\r\nSouth. This general subject received no small share of his attention;\r\nthe facts which investigation disclosed deepened his conviction\r\nof the essential barbarity of much that passes for civilization in\r\nthat section, and added to the inflexibility of his opposition to a\r\npolitical system, which was responsible for the atrocious crimes of the\r\nKu-Klux-Klan, \"the Mississippi plan,\" the White League, and the \"rifle\r\nclubs,\" and for the horrible massacres of Colfax and Coushatta, of\r\nHamburg and Ellenton.\r\n\r\nTwo of his speeches in the Senate in 1871 and 1872 attracted general\r\nattention and were widely republished. One of them was delivered on\r\nJanuary 18, 1871, in reply to Mr. Casserly of California, who had\r\nchallenged a comparison between the records of the Republican and\r\nDemocratic parties. In the course of twenty minutes Mr. Chandler\r\nrapidly sketched the services of the Republican party in defeating the\r\nDemocratic plot to surrender the territories to slavery, in crushing a\r\nDemocratic rebellion, in emancipating four million slaves, in building\r\na trans-continental railway to the Pacific coast, in inviting the\r\nsettlement of the Great West by a homestead law, in establishing the\r\nnational banking system, in maintaining the public credit against\r\nDemocratic attack, and in reconstructing the South on the basis of\r\nfreedom and loyalty. He closed as follows:\r\n\r\n  These measures were carried, not with the Democratic party, but\r\n  in spite of the Democratic party. Sir, we are not to be arraigned\r\n  here and put on the defensive, certainly not by that old Democratic\r\n  party.\r\n\r\n  And now, Mr. President, they ask us to do what? To forgive the past\r\n  and let by-gones be by-gones. You hear on the right hand and on the\r\n  left, from every quarter, \"Let by-gones be by-gones; let us forget\r\n  the past and rub it out.\" Sir, we have no disposition to forget\r\n  the past. We have a record of which we are proud. We have a record\r\n  that has gone into history. There we propose to let it stand. We\r\n  never propose to blot out that record. There are no thousand years\r\n  in the world's history in which so much has been accomplished for\r\n  human liberty and human progress as has been accomplished by this\r\n  great Republican party in the short space of ten years. Blot out\r\n  that record? Never, sir, never! It is a record that will go down\r\n  in history through all times as the proudest ever made by any\r\n  political party that ever existed on earth. But, sir, do gentlemen\r\n  of the Democratic party want to blot out their record? I do not\r\n  blame them for wanting to, for that record is a record of treason.\r\n  It, too, has gone into history, and there it must stand through all\r\n  ages. Sir, the young men of this country are looking at these two\r\n  records, and they are making up their minds as to which they desire\r\n  their names to go down to history upon; and I am happy to say that\r\n  of the young men now coming upon the stage of action, nine out of\r\n  every ten are joining this great Republican party. They desire that\r\n  their record shall be associated with those who saved this great\r\n  nation, and not with those who attempted its overthrow. The day\r\n  is far distant when that old Democratic party that attempted to\r\n  overthrow this government will again be entrusted with power by the\r\n  people of this nation.... Mr. President, if this record of the two\r\n  parties does not please my Democratic friends, I have only to say\r\n  to them that they made it deliberately and they have got to stand\r\n  by it.\r\n\r\nOn June 6, 1872, Mr. Chandler replied in the Senate to that part of\r\nMr. Sumner's elaborate attack upon General Grant in which he declared\r\nthat Edwin M. Stanton had said, in his last days, \"General Grant cannot\r\ngovern this country.\" The excessive egotism, which marred Mr. Sumner's\r\ncharacter and which inspired that unfortunate speech, was always a\r\ncause of impatience with Mr. Chandler, and this display of it aroused\r\nhis anger. In his reply, he challenged squarely the credibility of Mr.\r\nSumner's statement. He first read from Mr. Stanton's reported speeches,\r\nto show that their enthusiastic and repeated commendation of General\r\nGrant by name proved that Mr. Sumner's assertion that Mr. Stanton had\r\nalso said, \"In my speeches I never introduced the name of General\r\nGrant; I spoke for the Republican cause and the Republican party,\" was\r\nexactly contrary to the fact. He then proceeded:\r\n\r\n  Mr. President, I had occasion with Mr. Wade, formerly Senator from\r\n  Ohio, as member of the Committee on the Conduct of the War, to see\r\n  Mr. Stanton, I think once a day on an average, during the whole\r\n  war, and I was in the habit of visiting him up to the time of his\r\n  death, and never, under any circumstances, did he express in my\r\n  presence any but the highest opinion of General Grant, both as to\r\n  his military capacity and as to his civil capacity.\r\n\r\n  Mr. President, on the Friday before the death of E. M. Stanton, I\r\n  had occasion to visit him in company with two friends, members of\r\n  the other House, one Hon. Judge Beaman, then a member for Michigan,\r\n  the other Judge Conger, now a member from Michigan. We had that\r\n  day a long interview of not less than an hour and a half, wherein\r\n  Mr. Stanton expressed the highest opinion of President Grant, both\r\n  as to his military and civil capacity. I awaited an interview with\r\n  these parties before making this statement, and their recollection\r\n  is the same as my own. I have likewise held two or three interviews\r\n  with Senator Wade since then, and his recollection of the\r\n  expressions of the late E. M. Stanton is equally strong as my own\r\n  to-day. Mr. Stanton said, in the presence of two witnesses, \"The\r\n  country knows General Grant to be a great warrior; I know he will\r\n  prove a great civilian.\" ...\r\n\r\n  Mr. President, the relations between the President of the\r\n  United States and the late Secretary Stanton were of remarkable\r\n  kindliness. Never did I hear either express any but the highest\r\n  esteem and regard for the other.... I think the last interview\r\n  he ever had was the interview with me in the presence of these\r\n  two living witnesses.... Surgeon-General Barnes was his attending\r\n  physician at the hour of his death. According to his testimony,\r\n  from the hour I last saw him up to the time of his death, there was\r\n  no change, so far as can be known.\r\n\r\n  In another part of this speech the President is arraigned as a\r\n  great gift-taker. Sir, General Grant was a great taker. Few men\r\n  have ever been as eminent as takers. He took Fort Donelson with\r\n  some twenty or thirty thousand soldiers; and he took Shiloh, and\r\n  took Vicksburg, and took the Wilderness, and took Murfreesboro'\r\n  and Appomattox and all the rebel material of war. He, with his\r\n  army, took the shackles from 4,000,000 slaves. And, sir, after he\r\n  had taken the vitals out of the rebellion, he was urged by his\r\n  friends to accept a small donation to take himself out of the\r\n  hands of poverty, a thing that has been done by all nations and by\r\n  all grateful peoples in all ages of the world. Sir, he is to be\r\n  arraigned as a great gift-taker because he accepted the voluntary\r\n  contributions of a grateful people!\r\n\r\n  Why, sir, there were few men of capacity, few men of fitness to\r\n  occupy positions under this government who did not subscribe,\r\n  gratefully, anxiously subscribe, to that fund to relieve U. S.\r\n  Grant from his poverty. And yet, he is to be arraigned here as a\r\n  gift-taker, as though that was a crime!\r\n\r\n  Mr. President, there are two classes of people in this world,\r\n  and we see specimens of them both. We have great _o-ra-tors_ and\r\n  great men of business. On this floor our _o-ra-tors_ have occupied\r\n  the time of this session to the exclusion of business, and while\r\n  these _o-ra-tors_ have been wasting the time of this body to the\r\n  detriment of the business of the nation, willing to indulge in\r\n  windy orations at the expense of the government, U. S. Grant,\r\n  President of the United States, has been managing the affairs of\r\n  this nation better than they were ever managed before. While your\r\n  _o-ra-tors_ were here delivering windy words, he was paying the\r\n  national debt faster than these _o-ra-tors_ could count it. While\r\n  they were _o-ra-ting_, he was negotiating treaties and attending\r\n  to the civil service of the nation. While they were _o-ra-ting_\r\n  on this floor during the war, he was winning victories in the\r\n  bloodiest part of the fight. And now, while they are _o-ra-ting_\r\n  on this floor, he is endearing himself to the hearts of the\r\n  whole people of this land as no other man ever did. Stanton was\r\n  prophetic; he is not only great in war, but he is greater as a\r\n  civilian.\r\n\r\nThe act of March 3, 1873, which raised the annual salaries of\r\nCongressmen from $5,000 to $7,500, gave also to this increase a\r\nretroactive effect and made it apply to the members of Congress who\r\npassed the measure and whose official terms ended on that very day.\r\nPublic opinion did not approve of any aspect of this change, but it\r\ncondemned vehemently the voting by Congressmen to themselves of $5,000\r\neach for services already rendered and in addition to liberal salaries\r\nfixed at the time of their acceptance of office. So emphatic were the\r\nmanifestations of popular wrath at both this act and its methods,\r\nthat the next Congress promptly repealed \"the salary grab,\" as it was\r\ncommonly called. Mr. Chandler's integrity and good sense kept him\r\nfrom any participation in this obnoxious performance. He opposed the\r\nincrease of compensation earnestly in the Senate, voted against it\r\nat all stages of the contest, and refused to accept his \"back pay.\"\r\nWhen the bill had been passed and the increased salary had been placed\r\nto his credit on the Senate books, he went to the Treasury with his\r\ncolleague and they deposited the difference between the old and the new\r\nrate to the credit of the government, writing the following letter to\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury:\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, March 28, 1873.\r\n\r\n  SIR: Herewith find drafts on the Treasury, one of $3,906.80 payable\r\n  to Z. Chandler, the other of $3,920, to T. W. Ferry, being avails\r\n  of retroactive increase of salary passed during the expiring days\r\n  of and for the Forty-second Congress, and this day placed in our\r\n  hands by the Secretary of the Senate.\r\n\r\n  Not willing to gain what we voted against, we request that the same\r\n  be applied toward the cancellation of any of the six per cent.\r\n  interest-bearing obligations of the nation. Lest such return be\r\n  distorted into possible reflection upon the propriety of dissimilar\r\n  disposition by others, you will oblige us much by giving no\r\n  publicity to the matter. Very respectfully, yours,\r\n\r\n                                                            Z. CHANDLER,\r\n                                                            T. W. FERRY.\r\n\r\nThe amount refunded was the exact difference between the sums allowed\r\nunder the old and the increased rate. The new law gave an increase of\r\nsalary for the term, without mileage. The old law allowed $5,000 less\r\nsalary, but gave mileage in addition. Mr. Chandler and Mr. Ferry took\r\nthe amount due them under the old system, and returned the additional\r\nsum which was allowed them under the new. The spirit of scrupulous\r\nhonesty which dictated this proceeding is shown in the last sentence\r\nof the joint letter, asking that publicity might not be given to their\r\naction. They took this step voluntarily and not under any constraint\r\nfrom public opinion.\r\n\r\nIn the general elections of 1870 and 1872 Mr. Chandler was exceedingly\r\nactive, making the usual number of public addresses, and also\r\ndevoting much time to organization and to the general distribution of\r\npolitical literature. The latter branch of party effort had become\r\nthe special province of the Republican Congressional Committee.\r\nFor more than twenty years there have been two distinct executive\r\norganizations within the Republican party, independent of each other,\r\nbut always working in harmony, namely: The National Committee, and the\r\nCongressional Committee. The latter is composed of a Representative\r\nin Congress from each State, chosen by the Republican members of the\r\nrespective delegations. No man can serve upon this committee unless\r\nhe holds a seat in Congress, and States which have no Republican\r\nCongressmen are unrepresented in its membership. Mr. Chandler and\r\nJames M. Edmunds were the founders of the Congressional Committee as\r\na practical and influential working body; their plans and efforts\r\nfirst made it a power in American politics, and it remained under\r\ntheir joint control until Mr. Chandler became chairman of the National\r\nCommittee. The special objects which it aimed to accomplish were the\r\nsecuring of a uniform treatment of political topics by newspapers\r\nand speakers throughout the country, and the circulation (under the\r\nfranking privilege, or otherwise) of instructive and timely documents.\r\nDuring the reconstruction era it also devoted much attention to the\r\nwork of Republican organization in the South, where special efforts\r\nwere necessary to form into effective voting masses the emancipated\r\nslaves, not yet freed from the blindness of bondage or familiar\r\nwith the responsibilities of citizenship. But the great aim of the\r\ncommittee--all else that it did was subsidiary to that--was the\r\ncirculation of political literature. This end it sought to reach by\r\ntwo methods: First, by the publication and mailing to individuals and\r\nto local committees in all parts of the country of such Congressional\r\nspeeches as treated thoroughly and effectively any phase of the\r\ncurrent political situation; second, by furnishing the Republican\r\npress, through the medium of weekly sheets of carefully prepared\r\nmatter, with accurate information as to the facts underlying existing\r\nissues and with suggestions as to their best treatment before the\r\npeople. Obviously this work could be done to much better advantage\r\nat Washington than elsewhere, for the capital city is the focus of\r\nthe thousand currents of political opinion and the depository of\r\nthe official statistics of the nation. Hence it was deemed wise\r\nto establish a system of guidance from that point of the public\r\ndiscussions of each national campaign, so that increased intelligence,\r\ncohesion, and efficiency could be given to the general attack on\r\nthe enemy; this idea--which is, in brief, that the systematizing of\r\nthe political education of the people is an important element of\r\nwell-planned party warfare--James M. Edmunds always held tenaciously;\r\naided by Mr. Chandler's friendship, influence, means, and co-operation,\r\nhe proved its soundness most conclusively.\r\n\r\nEarly in his Senatorial service Mr. Chandler was made the chairman\r\nof this committee, and Mr. Edmunds its secretary. The two men were\r\nadmirably matched. Mr. Edmunds was a natural planner, keen in his\r\nintuitions, shrewd in observation, and a skillful judge of the bearing\r\nand tendency of party and public policies. In determining what was the\r\nmost promising line of attack, where the weakest points of the enemy's\r\nlines were to be found, wherein the strength of any position lay, or\r\nwhat strategy would make victory the most certain and complete, he had\r\nno superior. When his acute and experienced judgment was reinforced by\r\nMr. Chandler's vigor in execution, influence with public men, and large\r\nwealth great results never failed to follow. These two men quickly made\r\nthe Congressional Committee one of the most powerful agencies of party\r\nwarfare known in American politics. In many campaigns its influence was\r\nalmost literally felt in every Northern township, and its labors were\r\nnot without some effect, more frequently greater than less, in unifying\r\nand invigorating the contest in every Congressional district from\r\nMaine to Texas and Florida to Oregon. Its work was done quietly, but\r\nmost thoroughly; its managers rather shunned than courted publicity;\r\nand the people at large, who were informed and inspired by its labors,\r\nknew nothing of its methods and activity, hardly the fact of its\r\nexistence. From 1866 to 1874 Mr. Chandler was very active in connection\r\nwith this committee, and never failed to provide the agencies and the\r\nresources for the adequate carrying on of its work. When its treasury\r\ngrew empty his private check made good any deficiency, and repeatedly\r\nhis advances upon its account reached tens of thousands of dollars.\r\nHis confidence in Secretary Edmunds was implicit, and the latter's\r\nmature recommendations never failed because of any lack of means. In\r\n1870 the work of this committee was especially productive; its value\r\nbecame much more clearly apparent then than had ever been the case\r\nbefore, and Mr. Chandler repeatedly said to the President and other\r\nRepublican leaders, \"Judge Edmunds is the Bismark of this campaign.\" In\r\n1872 Mr. Edmunds first suggested the necessity of meeting the Greeley\r\nmovement by the thorough searching of the files of the New York\r\n_Tribune_ and of Mr. Greeley's record, for the ample material therein\r\ncontained which would make impossible his support by the Democratic\r\nmasses. Mr. Chandler approved of this plan, and promised that the\r\nmoney needed should be forthcoming. Before all the work was completed,\r\nhis advances had reached nearly $30,000. At times, in the course of\r\nefforts of this character, Mr. Edmunds guided the pens of upward of\r\nthree hundred writers gathered under his general supervision, while\r\nthe results of their labors informed the editorial pages of thousands\r\nof Republican newspapers, and thus reached millions of voting readers.\r\nFor some time, also, a monthly periodical named _The Republic_ was\r\nissued, which preserved in durable form the most careful and elaborate\r\narticles prepared under the committee's supervision. This work of the\r\npolitical enlightenment of the people, clearly the most rational agency\r\nof party warfare, has never been executed on this continent with the\r\nthoroughness, intelligence and efficiency which marked the labors of\r\nthe Congressional Committee when Mr. Chandler was at its head and Mr.\r\nEdmunds was its executive officer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES M. EDMUNDS.]\r\n\r\nThe man whose name is so closely coupled in these pages with that\r\nof Mr. Chandler deserves the grateful and lasting remembrance of the\r\nRepublican party. James M. Edmunds was a natural politician of the\r\nbest type. Patriotic instincts and sincere convictions were interwoven\r\nwith his nature. The party whose tendencies satisfied those instincts,\r\nand whose policies most nearly accorded with those convictions, he\r\nserved loyally and with rare capacity; more than this, he served it\r\nunselfishly. He cared nothing for prominence, and never sought after\r\nreputation. He made no speeches, he rarely shared in any public\r\ndemonstration, he held no conspicuous positions, he manifested no\r\npersonal ambition, but for twenty years he was the trusted counselor\r\nof famous men at the capital, his influence was felt in national\r\nlegislation and party movements, and important events with which his\r\nname never was and never will be connected received the impress of his\r\nacute observation and sagacious judgment. Especially in Republican\r\npolitical management was he a wise and strong \"power behind the\r\nthrone.\" Mr. Edmunds was a native of Western New York, but emigrated\r\nto Michigan in 1831. He was for many years a prominent business man\r\nat Ypsilanti, Vassar and Detroit, in that State, and was always\r\npolitically active. The Whigs sent him repeatedly to the Legislature,\r\nand made him their (unsuccessful) candidate for Governor in 1847. He\r\nwas chairman of the Republican State Central Committee from 1855 to\r\n1861, and Controller of the city of Detroit for two of those years.\r\nAt the commencement of Mr. Lincoln's administration he removed to\r\nWashington, and was there successively Commissioner of the General\r\nLand Office, Postmaster of the Senate, and Postmaster of the city of\r\nWashington. Personally he was a tall and spare man, exceedingly plain\r\nin his manners and simple in his tastes, utterly without either the\r\nliking for or faculty of display, retiring in disposition, firm of\r\npurpose, of strict integrity, and exact in his dealings and habits.\r\nMr. Edmunds's remarkable strength as a politician consisted in his\r\nexperience, in his lack of any personal aspirations, in his skill\r\nin controlling men and the accuracy of his judgment as to their\r\nmotives, and in an almost prophetic ability to reason out the probable\r\ndirection and effect of any given plan of action. He became a man\r\nwhom those charged with great responsibilities could profitably and\r\nsafely consult, and his well-considered and shrewd advice often had\r\ndecisive weight at the White House, on the floors of Congress, and\r\nin the private councils of eminent men. Outside of the Congressional\r\nCommittee, he did much campaign work in directing organization and\r\nsuggesting plans. He was one of the founders of the Union League,\r\nand directed its operations during the years of its great political\r\nusefulness in the South. It may be said without exaggeration that no\r\nsingle member of the Republican party ever rendered it services as\r\ngreat and as slightly requited as were those of James M. Edmunds.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler's close friendship with Mr. Edmunds covered a period of\r\nnearly half a century, and included an implicit confidence in the man\r\nhimself and in his prudence and the sagacity of his judgment. The\r\ncomment made upon their intimacy by one who knew them both well was,\r\n\"Sometimes it seemed to me that no man could be as wise as Mr. Chandler\r\nbelieved that Judge Edmunds was.\" They were in almost constant\r\nconsultation upon public questions, their co-operation was ever hearty,\r\nand this friendship the Senator valued as a priceless possession. \"In\r\ndeath they were not divided;\" the dispatch, which announced that Mr.\r\nChandler's busy life had ended so suddenly in Chicago, came to Mr.\r\nEdmunds while infirm in health; it affected him powerfully, and his\r\nspirit did not pass from under the shadow of this blow; within a few\r\nweeks his own death followed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[34] To a letter of confidence and congratulation, written to him\r\nat the time of his last Senatorial election, by a committee of the\r\ncolored citizens of East Saginaw, Mich., Mr. Chandler replied (under\r\ndate of Feb. 20, 1879): \"I hope to be able to assist in the grand but\r\nunfinished work of securing equal political rights for every citizen of\r\nthis country, black as well as white, South as well as North.\"\r\n\r\n[35] The value of this class of documents will further appear from two\r\nquotations from the official \"Digest of the Report of the Southern\r\nClaims Commission upon the Disallowed Claims,\" only two being taken\r\nwhere many might be. \"Claim No. 193\" was preferred before this\r\nCommission by W. R. Alexander of Dickson, Ala., for $13,443, for cotton\r\nand horses furnished to the Union army. Mr. Alexander produced evidence\r\nto show, and swore himself, that he had been a consistent Union man.\r\nThe Digest (1 vol., p. 55) says: \"Among the papers of the rebel\r\ngovernment found at Richmond is a letter, now in the War Department, a\r\ncopy of which Adjutant-General Townsend has furnished to us. It reads\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"'DICKSON, Ala., August 1, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"SIR: I have heard that the War Department was scarce of arms, and I\r\nhave taken it upon myself to look up all the old muskets I can find and\r\nI now send them to you, and I hope they will kill many a Yankee. I have\r\nhad one musket fixed to my notion, which I send with the others for a\r\nmodel. All here are delighted with our victory, both white and black.\r\nYours, respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                                       WM. R. ALEXANDER.\r\n\r\n\"P. S. I send these guns, ten in number, to the Ordnance Department,\r\nRichmond, Virginia.\r\n\r\n                                                                W. R. A.\r\n\r\n_\"The Hon. L. P. Walker.\"_\r\n\r\n\"On October 11, 1872, the counsel for the claimant, John J. Key,\r\nEsq., appeared before the Commissioners and requested that the claim\r\nbe withdrawn, admitting the disloyalty of the claimant. The claim is\r\nrejected.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Claim 135\" was preferred by J. P. Levy of Wilmington, N. C., for\r\n$10,000. After he had sworn to his own loyalty, he was called upon\r\nto face some letters found in the rebel archives. The Commission say\r\n(p. 33, 1 vol., Digest): \"The original letters were furnished the\r\nCommission by the War Department from the captured rebel archives, and\r\ncopies of several of them were filed with this report.... We have in\r\nthem the claimant at the outbreak of the war calling upon the rebel\r\ngovernment to punish the superintendent of his brother's plantation\r\nfor insulting the rebel flag; and, again, asking the rebel Congress\r\nto pass a law granting him his brother's plantation on account of his\r\nsignal service to the rebel cause; and, again, offering a ship, to be\r\ncommanded by himself, for the rebel service; also, tendering for the\r\nbenefit of the rebel army, patent fuse train and soda baking-powders,\r\nand boasting and complaining of the large amount due him from the rebel\r\ngovernment for supplies for the rebel army. And now this shameless\r\ntraitor, perjurer and swindler comes before us and swears, with brazen\r\neffrontery, that the government of the United States owes him, as a\r\nloyal adherent to the cause of the Union and the government throughout\r\nthe war of the rebellion, for supplies furnished the army, the sum of\r\n$10,000. We reject this claim.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE MAINTENANCE OF A SOUND CURRENCY AND THE PUBLIC FAITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1873 the bubble of an irredeemable currency, inflated prices, and\r\nwild speculation burst in the United States, and the era of universal\r\nshrinkage, commercial collapse, and industrial stagnation began. The\r\nfinancial condition of the government and the people at once became the\r\nabsorbing topic of public discussion, and for five years the questions\r\nconnected with the currency and the national credit were those which\r\nmost completely absorbed popular attention. Mr. Chandler's share in the\r\nprolonged controversy over the financial problem was a conspicuous one;\r\nhe came into it equipped with clear ideas and a consistent record; he\r\ncontended for the causes of rational finance and public honesty without\r\nwavering in the face of the strongest opposition, and without any\r\ndeparture from sound doctrine; and he saw the courage and persistence\r\nof those with whom he acted finally rewarded by the enlightenment of\r\nthe people, the restoration of a convertible currency, and the raising\r\nof the credit of the United States to the highest standard. For obvious\r\nreasons his record upon all the phases of \"the financial question\"\r\ncan be most satisfactorily treated in a single chapter. That record\r\nwill show that he began at a point to which many other public men\r\nwere brought only by years of education, and it well illustrates the\r\nclearness of his conceptions of the principles underlying questions\r\nconnected with what may be called the practical departments of\r\nstatesmanship.\r\n\r\nNot the least of the difficulties, which at the outset confronted\r\nthe administration of Abraham Lincoln, was the fact that the public\r\ntreasury was empty and the national credit impaired. In October, 1860,\r\nthe government had contracted a five per cent. loan of $7,000,000 at a\r\nsmall premium; four months later, a six per cent. loan had been sold\r\nwith difficulty at about ninety cents on the dollar. It was true,\r\nby way of offset, that the country was in a generally prosperous\r\ncondition. The commercial wrecks of 1857 had disappeared, crops were\r\nabundant, and general business had become again remunerative. This was\r\nan element of national strength, but it was not a quickly available\r\nresource. War meant large immediate expenditure, for which the means\r\nmust be promptly provided. There was no time to create and organize\r\nupon an extensive scale the machinery of direct taxation, and some\r\ndoubts were then felt as to whether the people would not grow restive\r\nunder any general imposition of new burdens. The entire stock of coin\r\nin the North was estimated at but about $121,000,000, while the paper\r\nmoney in existence was exclusively composed of the notes of state\r\nbanks organized under diverse and often insecure systems, and much\r\nof it circulated only at a discount. This condition of the currency\r\ncreated the fear that the rapid negotiation of large government loans\r\ncould not be accomplished without the serious derangement of the money\r\nmarket; the withdrawal of considerable sums from circulation, even\r\ntemporarily, business men believed would be impossible without great\r\ninjury to domestic enterprise and commerce. All these circumstances\r\nforced the government (which found itself facing absolutely without\r\npreparation organized rebellion) to resort at once to the issue of a\r\nnational paper currency in the form of non-interest-bearing treasury\r\nnotes of small denominations. Congress, at its extra session in July,\r\n1861, passed the necessary act for this purpose, and $50,000,000 of\r\nthese notes ($10,000,000 more were subsequently authorized) were placed\r\nin circulation; originally they were made redeemable in coin on demand\r\nat any United States sub-treasury, and thus violated none of the\r\nestablished principles of sound finance. This expedient facilitated\r\nthe negotiation of loans, and provided \"the sinews of war\" for 1861.\r\nBut, when Congress met in December of that year, it had become plain\r\nthat the struggle would be of indefinite duration, and that past\r\nexpenditures would be greatly exceeded in the months to come. To add to\r\nthe embarrassments of the situation, at about this time the banks of\r\nthe North suspended specie payments, and the Treasury Department was\r\ncompelled as a matter of self-protection to also stop redeeming in coin\r\nits own notes then outstanding. It was as a means of escape from this\r\nemergency, that the first issue of greenbacks was authorized (by the\r\nact of Feb. 25, 1862). These notes were not redeemable on demand, but\r\nto secure their free circulation they were made a \"legal tender\" for\r\nall purposes except the payment of duties and of the interest on the\r\npublic debt. The abandonment of the self-operating method of redemption\r\nand the resort to the compulsion of the \"legal tender\" enactment, as\r\na means of keeping these notes in circulation, constituted a step\r\nwhich the Thirty-seventh Congress took with extreme reluctance. A\r\nsmall minority of its members resisted this measure to the last, but\r\nwhat seemed to be the overshadowing necessities of the situation and\r\nthe earnest appeals of Secretary Chase finally forced the passage of\r\nthe law. Mr. Chandler was one of those who, without approving of the\r\nprinciple of this legislation, still voted for it, on the ground that\r\nit was essential to the public safety at that moment and justified\r\nby the urgency of the situation. But he regarded it as a temporary\r\nexpedient, a mere plan for an emergency, and not as a permanent policy.\r\nThe first act authorized the issue of $150,000,000 of \"greenbacks\" and\r\ndirected the retiring of the $60,000,000 of treasury notes previously\r\npaid out; this $150,000,000 Mr. Chandler believed it was possible to\r\nso control and use as to avoid the evils inseparable from inflation.\r\nBut the proposition to double the amount of \"greenbacks,\" which came\r\nin less than half a year from the Treasury officials, he strenuously\r\nopposed. On June 17, 1862, he offered this resolution in the Senate:\r\n\r\n  _Be it Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives_, That\r\n  the amount of \"legal tender\" treasury notes authorized by law shall\r\n  never be increased.\r\n\r\nOn the following day he called up this resolution, and said:\r\n\r\n  The effect of the recommendation (to issue $300,000,000 of \"legal\r\n  tender\" notes) has been most disastrous. The mere recommendation,\r\n  without any action of Congress on the subject, has created such a\r\n  panic, and has so convinced the moneyed centers of the world that\r\n  we are to be flooded with this paper, that gold has risen in price\r\n  from two and three-quarters to seven per cent. premium. National\r\n  credit is precisely like individual credit. It is based, first,\r\n  on the ability to pay; and, second, upon the high and honorable\r\n  principle which would induce the payment of a liability. When the\r\n  proposition to issue treasury notes was first made, it was received\r\n  with great apprehension by Congress and by the nation.... There\r\n  was at that time a vacuum for $50,000,000 that must be filled from\r\n  some source.... I then believed that $100,000,000 was requisite,\r\n  and that $100,000,000 was enough. I believe so now. When you issue\r\n  $100,000,000 of currency you must either find a vacuum or you must\r\n  create one for it. A hundred millions in addition to the existing\r\n  circulation would at any time create great disturbance in the\r\n  financial condition of this country.... The moment you authorize\r\n  the issue of $300,000,000 your coin will rise to ten or twelve\r\n  per cent., and your notes will full to 90 or 85. The result will\r\n  be that the government will be paying just so much more for every\r\n  article it purchases than it would if you kept your circulating\r\n  notes at or about the value of coin.\r\n\r\n  Again, the moment you reduce the value of these notes, even\r\n  to the point at which they now stand, even to seven per cent.\r\n  discount, you drive out of circulation the coin of the country.\r\n  The temptation is too strong to be resisted to use something\r\n  else besides coin for change and for small circulation. Are we\r\n  to be reduced to a shin-plaster circulation, as is the case\r\n  to-day all through the South? That will be the result if you\r\n  force upon the country an amount of circulating notes beyond its\r\n  requirements.... I consider it a duty we owe to the country, a\r\n  duty we owe to ourselves, to proclaim that under no circumstances\r\n  shall a currency, irredeemable in coin, beyond the present issue of\r\n  $150,000,000, be thrust upon the money markets of the country.\r\n\r\nBut the pressure toward a reckless currency expansion was irresistible,\r\nand the pending bill passed. Mr. Chandler's prophecies were promptly\r\nverified, for the gold premium rose and the \"shin-plaster currency\"\r\nmade its appearance with but little delay. Moreover, these issues only\r\nstimulated the thirst they were intended to quench, and the general\r\ninflation of prices soon again produced an apparent scarcity of\r\ncurrency. Early in 1863 a demand came from Mr. Chase for authority to\r\nincrease the \"greenback\" circulation to $400,000,000. Congress granted\r\nthis application, but Mr. Chandler opposed it, saying in the Senate:\r\n\r\n  When the first proposition was made to issue $150,000,000 of\r\n  treasury notes, I favored it; but when the proposition was made to\r\n  increase that to $300,000,000, I opposed it.... I prophesied what\r\n  the result of thus thrusting $300,000,000 of irredeemable paper\r\n  upon an already overstocked market would be. I said it would carry\r\n  up coin to an unlimited extent. The result has proved that my\r\n  predictions were true. Now it is proposed to issue $400,000,000;\r\n  we propose to thrust them upon an already over-supplied market....\r\n  It is our duty to protect the people, so far as in our power, from\r\n  this great depreciation in the specie value of the circulating\r\n  medium, and this we can only do by decreasing its volume.\r\n\r\nThe general positions which he stated thus early Mr. Chandler\r\nfirmly held throughout every stage of the subsequent contest over\r\nthe \"currency question.\" He believed that irredeemable paper money,\r\nalthough issued by the government itself and made a \"legal tender\" by\r\nsupreme authority, was an unmixed evil; that only the most imminent\r\nperil could justify an even temporary resort to its use; that it ought\r\nnever to be employed except within narrow limits; that any excessive\r\nissues, if made, should be promptly called in; that it should be made\r\nredeemable on demand in coin, \"the money of the world,\" at the earliest\r\npossible moment; and that ultimately it should be wholly withdrawn\r\nfrom circulation by the issuing power. Accordingly, he opposed the\r\npropositions to still further increase (to $450,000,000) the issue\r\nof \"greenbacks,\" supported the principle (while objecting to some\r\nof the details) of the act of April 12, 1866, ordering their steady\r\ncontraction, and was opposed to the act of Feb. 4, 1868, stopping\r\nsuch contraction. The reduction in the volume of the \"greenbacks\" he\r\nbelieved to be an indispensable preliminary to the resumption of specie\r\npayments, saying in the Senate: \"The government will never resume so\r\nlong as it has $400,000,000 of outstanding demand notes.\" As he opposed\r\nduring the war excessive issues of the \"greenbacks,\" so after it closed\r\nhe steadily favored the reduction of their volume with the view to the\r\nearly restoration of their convertibility and their final redemption\r\nand canceling. The hesitating and halting policy, which perpetuated all\r\nthe unwholesome influences of inflation and added to the severity of\r\nthe inevitable collapse, was followed against his protest and in the\r\nface of predictions, which were inspired by his intimate knowledge of\r\nnatural commercial laws, and were verified by the event.\r\n\r\nIn the constant discussions of financial measures during the war, Mr.\r\nChandler did not earnestly oppose the frequent resort to the issue of\r\nirredeemable paper without offering as a substitute policies which he\r\nbelieved would yield relief, equally adequate, much less costly, and\r\nfar less unwholesome in tendency. He proposed to provide the means for\r\nmeeting the enormous expenditures required of the government by more\r\nthorough direct taxation and by larger loans; and he believed that\r\nincreased imposts, by strengthening the credit of the government, would\r\ngreatly improve its standing as a borrower in the money markets of\r\nthe world. Briefly, the policy which he favored, in lieu of the mass\r\nof temporary expedients which were adopted, was this: (1.) Declare\r\nthat the issue of \"legal tender\" treasury notes should not exceed\r\n$150,000,000, and thus stop their depreciation by ending all fear\r\nof their inflation. (2.) Tax freely, and by this means convince the\r\nworld that the United States could and would redeem its treasury notes\r\nand pay the interest and principal of its bonds. (3.) Use the credit\r\nthus created to borrow on the most advantageous terms, and avoid all\r\nmeasures that might in any way tend to impair the negotiable value of,\r\nor the general confidence in, the national securities. He developed\r\nthese general ideas repeatedly in his speeches and votes, while\r\nquestions relating to them were before Congress. On May 30, 1862, he\r\nsaid in the Senate:\r\n\r\n  We voted at an early day in the session that we would raise a tax\r\n  of $150,000,000 from all sources.... What was the result of that\r\n  vote? On the very day that that solemn pledge was given to the\r\n  country and the world ... the six per cent. bonds of the United\r\n  States stood at 90 cents on the dollar in the city of New York.\r\n  To-day with an expenditure of more than a million dollars a day,\r\n  ... under this simple pledge in advance, of what you would do, your\r\n  bonds have gone up from 90 cents to above par, and are now sought\r\n  for, not only at home but abroad. If you violate that solemn pledge\r\n  given to your country and to the world, what will be the effect on\r\n  your securities? Let Congress violate that pledge, and you will\r\n  see your bonds not only not worth 104½ but you will see them below\r\n  85.... The world abroad does not believe your simple asseveration\r\n  that you would impose a tax, but the people of this Union do and\r\n  consequently they themselves have carried your bonds from 90 to\r\n  104½. But the world does not take them. Impose your tax; carry out\r\n  your solemn pledges, and you will see your bonds eagerly sought\r\n  for in the moneyed centers of the world.... I hope we shall not\r\n  only carry out this pledge which we have given, but I care not if\r\n  we exceed it.... Under this pledge ... you are now able to borrow\r\n  money at six per cent. instead of seven and three-tenths, and you\r\n  are to-day reaping the reward of your pledge of good faith.\r\n\r\nAll just tax measures Mr. Chandler vigorously supported, as furnishing\r\nthe solid basis of national credit and public integrity, and time\r\nestablished the ability and the willingness of the people to sustain\r\nthis war burden. Had the heavy taxation been accompanied by an\r\nadherence to sound principles in the management of the currency and\r\na resort to borrowing when needed, it would have reduced the cost of\r\nconquering the rebellion by at least $1,000,000,000, probably by nearly\r\none-half.\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of the public credit at a high standard was exceedingly\r\nimportant during the war, but it was of no less moment after the\r\ncollapse of the rebellion, and is as great to-day as it has ever been.\r\nOn no public question was Mr. Chandler more vigilant and outspoken\r\nthan on this. Any attack on the integrity of the national promise\r\nrepresented by the bonds of the United States he denounced vigorously,\r\nwhether it took on the form of the taxation of these securities,\r\nor of propositions to pay them in depreciated currency, or of bald\r\nrepudiation. On May 20, 1862, he said, upon the proposition to tax the\r\nbonds:\r\n\r\n  I believe it to be for the best interest of the government--not\r\n  for the benefit of moneyed men, not for the benefit of moneyed\r\n  institutions, but for the benefit of this government--to proclaim\r\n  in advance that we will never tax these bonds. I believe we\r\n  shall receive the _quid pro quo_ now, to-day, or whenever we\r\n  negotiate. It is for our interest, not for the interest of moneyed\r\n  institutions, to offer these bonds. Here is the best security in\r\n  the world, and we proclaim to the world, if you take these bonds\r\n  they shall never be taxed. I believe we shall realize more to-day,\r\n  or to-morrow, or this year, or next year, for these bonds by that\r\n  course, than if we were to impose a tax of one and a-half, or\r\n  three, or five, or any other per cent. These bonds are negotiable.\r\n  We are the negotiators. They are not in the hands of third parties.\r\n  We are to borrow for our daily wants, ... and I believe it to be\r\n  for the interest of the government to declare in advance that there\r\n  shall never be a tax of any sort, kind or description upon these\r\n  bonds which we are now offering to the world in such enormous\r\n  quantities.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler said, in 1868, in a public address at Battle Creek, Mich.,\r\n(on August 24):\r\n\r\n  The national debt is a sacred obligation upon this government,\r\n  and it is to be paid, every dollar of it. But it is a Democratic\r\n  debt, every dollar. If anybody should talk of repudiation it should\r\n  be the Republican party, who had no instrumentality in creating\r\n  it. But did you ever hear a Republican talk of repudiating it? It\r\n  is a large debt. It is the price we pay for government. Is the\r\n  government worth the cost? If it is, then the debt is not only an\r\n  honest debt, but it has been worthily contracted. The Democrats\r\n  propose to pay this debt in greenbacks, and they propose to pay the\r\n  greenbacks by issuing more greenbacks. What do we gain by that?\r\n  Issue $2,500,000,000 more greenbacks and they would not be worth\r\n  the paper they are printed on, because the supply would flood the\r\n  country and be greater than the demand.... It is a measure of\r\n  fraudulent repudiation. In five or ten years the country might\r\n  recover financially, but we would never wipe out the national\r\n  disgrace that would follow that repudiation. It means the absolute\r\n  annihilation of all values. These extra issues would be utterly\r\n  worthless.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler accordingly voted for the act of March 18, 1869, which\r\nformally declared that the United States would redeem its \"greenbacks\"\r\nand pay the interest and principal of its long term bonds in coin, and\r\nwhich was simply a new pledge that the government would do what it was\r\nalready honorably bound to do both by fair construction of its own\r\nlegislation and by the explicit and repeated promises of its agents.\r\nThe full maintenance of the public faith, both as a matter of honor\r\nand of wise policy, he always upheld, and saw his arguments sustained\r\nand his prophecies made good in the steady improvement of the nation's\r\ncredit and the refunding of its debt at greatly reduced rates of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nOf the national banking system Mr. Chandler was an original supporter.\r\nHe regarded it as certain to become a lasting feature of the fiscal\r\nsystem of the United States, and as destined to ultimately furnish\r\nthe paper money of the Union. The uniformity of its circulation, the\r\nsecurity afforded to bill-holders, and the excellent results attending\r\nits method of governmental supervision, he considered as unanswerable\r\narguments in favor of its permanent maintenance. It was his firm\r\nopinion that ultimately these banks would furnish all the national\r\ncurrency, and that their notes would supplant the \"greenbacks.\" If\r\nnational banking should be kept free, and redemption in coin required\r\nby law, he believed that the result would be a thoroughly-secured and\r\nreadily-convertible paper currency, whose volume would be controlled\r\nby commercial demand and not by legislative caprice or political\r\nagitation, and which would lubricate and not obstruct the machinery of\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nWhen the national bank bill first made its appearance in Congress,\r\nMr. Chandler (in February, 1863) favored it as a measure of relief\r\noffering a quick market for $300,000,000 of government bonds, and as\r\nsure to supply \"a better currency than the local banks now furnish.\"\r\nHolding the views he did, he supported the measures which promised to\r\nsubstitute bank notes for \"greenbacks,\" although he opposed those which\r\ncontemplated any expansion of the aggregate volume of both issues. For\r\ninstance, in 1870, when the inflation element in Congress introduced a\r\nbill to add $52,000,000 to the national bank circulation (banking was\r\nnot then free, it not being deemed prudent to leave the issue unlimited\r\nwhile all the paper money was irredeemable), he offered on January 31\r\nan amendment to make the sum $100,000,000 and to withdraw \"greenbacks\"\r\nto an amount equal to the bank notes issued under this provision. He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n  The simple effect of my proposition, if adopted, will be to keep\r\n  the circulation to a dollar where it is. If no new banks are\r\n  started, no greenbacks are withdrawn, and if banks are started\r\n  anywhere, then an amount of greenbacks must be withdrawn equal to\r\n  the amount of national bank bills put in circulation. Should the\r\n  whole $100,000,000 be taken we will be just $100,000,000 nearer to\r\n  specie payments than we are to-day, ... and in the meantime the\r\n  amount of national currency will not be changed in the slightest\r\n  degree.\r\n\r\n  MR. SUMNER: There is salvation in that.\r\n\r\n  MR. CHANDLER: Of course there is salvation in it; that is why I\r\n  offer it.\r\n\r\nAll proposals made at the time to increase the aggregate paper\r\ncirculation he resisted, saying:\r\n\r\n  That is a step in the wrong direction.... If you let it go out\r\n  that this is to be the policy of Congress, you will see gold go\r\n  up immediately, ... because it will show that the Congress of the\r\n  United States is in favor of expansion instead of a reduction of\r\n  the currency.\r\n\r\nAfter the panic of 1873, when there was such a universal clamor for\r\nfurther inflation, and scores of propositions were introduced to add\r\nmany millions to the existing volume of \"greenbacks\" and of bank notes,\r\nMr. Chandler again insisted at all proper opportunities that resumption\r\nwas the most essential step toward financial soundness, and that the\r\nsubstitution of bank notes for \"greenbacks\" would aid greatly both\r\nin reaching and in maintaining specie payment. On Feb. 18, 1874, he\r\noffered an amendment to a pending bill, directing \"the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury to retire and destroy one dollar in 'legal tender' notes\r\nfor each and every dollar of additional issue of bank notes,\" and spoke\r\nupon this proposition at length. He did not urge it as a complete\r\nremedy for the existing situation (contraction and resumption would\r\nalone furnish that), but he said:\r\n\r\n  This is a step in the right direction. In 1865 I advocated upon\r\n  this floor the substitution of bank notes for greenbacks as a step\r\n  toward the resumption of specie payments, and a rapid step toward\r\n  that resumption. I am now simply advocating what I advocated then.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler's wishes on this subject were not gratified at that time\r\nnor during his life, but before his death he saw the demand that the\r\nTreasury should cease to be a bank of issue approved by the soundest\r\nfinancial sentiment of the country. His belief, that the paper money\r\nof the Union should be furnished by commercial institutions operating\r\nunder properly regulated governmental supervision, that is, by the\r\nnational banking system perfected and enlarged, has been long held by\r\nthe ablest and clearest students of monetary problems in the United\r\nStates; it is to-day constantly growing in popular strength, and the\r\nresult it aims at will form part of any durable settlement of \"the\r\ncurrency question.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1873 the vacillating and halting financial policy of the\r\nnation--which had tried and abandoned contraction, and while looking\r\ntoward the resumption of specie payments had, in fact, retreated\r\nfrom it--bore fruit in speculative collapses, followed by a panic in\r\nbusiness circles and widespread commercial disaster. Congress met\r\namid the crumbling of unsound enterprise, and was called upon to meet\r\na terrified demand for a renewed inflation of the already excessive\r\nvolume of irredeemable paper. To cure the fever, men demanded more\r\nmiasma. To repair the ruin, which all history proved to be the natural\r\nresult of an oversupply of currency, it was proposed to still further\r\nincrease that supply. Measures to this end were introduced at once,\r\nand pushed with great vehemence. They were sustained by a misled but\r\npowerful public sentiment, which was especially strong in the West\r\nand influenced the great mass of that section's representatives at\r\nWashington. Mr. Chandler never served his country better than he did in\r\nthat hour. Unmoved by the clamor about him, and refusing to listen to\r\nthe cries of even his own people when they demanded false leadership,\r\nhe firmly resisted every measure of inflation and every suggestion\r\nthat added embarrassments to the business of the future, or increased\r\nthe difficulties of preserving the public faith. The pressure in favor\r\nof the inflation bill which President Grant vetoed was unusually\r\nstrong. The Western Congressmen were almost a unit for its passage,\r\nbut no solicitations, no force of numbers, prevented Mr. Chandler from\r\nopposing and denouncing it. His speech in opposition to this bill (on\r\nJan. 20, 1874) commenced with one of his terse sentences, which went\r\nstraight to the marrow of the situation, and furnished a motto for the\r\ncause he championed. It was, \"We need one thing besides more money,\r\nand that is better money.\" This phrase furnished the text for many\r\naddresses and editorials, and stood upon the title-page of the weekly\r\ncircular issued by the friends of a sound currency in Boston during the\r\ncontroversy which preceded the passage of the Resumption act of 1875.\r\nIn the same speech Mr. Chandler said:\r\n\r\n  To insure prosperity we ought to have something permanent,\r\n  something substantial. Then the business of the country will\r\n  conform itself to the facts and regulate itself accordingly. This\r\n  panic (of 1873) was exceptional, as indeed all panics are. A panic\r\n  among men is precisely like a panic among animals. I once saw\r\n  2,000 horses stampede, and they were just as the same number of\r\n  thousands of men would be in a panic. It is the feeling of animal\r\n  fear, and one encourages the other, and so it goes on until it\r\n  becomes a perfect insane rush for something, nobody knows what.\r\n  Prior to this late panic, as is well known, many of our capitalists\r\n  had over-invested in wild railroad schemes; they had undertaken to\r\n  do impossible things; when the panic struck them it ought not to\r\n  have had the least effect outside of Wall street and operators in\r\n  railroad stocks. But the panic swept like a tornado all over the\r\n  land, affected values everywhere, values of all kinds. Whoever had\r\n  money in bank sought to draw it out and hide it away. The panic\r\n  was universal, and yet this nation was never more prosperous than\r\n  it was the day before the panic struck. And to-day there is as\r\n  much money in the Union as there was then. Every dollar that was\r\n  here then is here now. Besides, the enormous borrowers, the men\r\n  who would pay any price for money--one-half per cent. a day, one\r\n  per cent. a day, or any other given price--have failed and gone\r\n  out of the market. And now the money is seeking the legitimate\r\n  channels of commerce for interest and use.... The best time for the\r\n  resumption of specie payment that has occurred since the suspension\r\n  was in 1865, at the close of the war, when gold had fallen from\r\n  over 200 to 122. In a few days values had shrunk, and the people\r\n  of the nation were comparatively out of debt, and were ready then\r\n  for a resumption of specie payments, but the government was not.\r\n  The government owed more than $1,000,000,000, that was maturing\r\n  daily in the shape of compound interest notes, seven-thirties and\r\n  other obligations that must be funded or disposed of. Hence the\r\n  government was not prepared for specie payments at that time,\r\n  although the people were.... From that day to this we have been\r\n  drifting and floating further and further away every hour from the\r\n  true path--the resumption of specie payments. I have advocated\r\n  from the first the earliest possible payment in coin. I believe\r\n  there is no other standard of value that will stand the test, and\r\n  I believe the time has arrived, or very nearly arrived, for coming\r\n  to it. I have not the same timidity in fixing a date that some of\r\n  my friends on this floor have. I believe that if we were to resolve\r\n  to-day that we would resume the payment of our greenbacks in coin\r\n  on the 1st day of January, 1875, and authorize the Secretary of\r\n  the Treasury to borrow $100,000,000 in coin to be used in the\r\n  redemption of the greenbacks, and sell no more gold until the 1st\r\n  of January, 1875, on that day we would have $200,000,000 of coin\r\n  in the Treasury for the redemption of the greenbacks. I am not\r\n  particular as to date. I merely suggest the 1st of January, 1875.\r\n  But I would accept an earlier date than that if it were deemed more\r\n  advisable, but certainly I would not extend it more than six months\r\n  thereafter....\r\n\r\n  It is no part of the business of this government to issue an\r\n  irredeemable currency. We cannot afford to place ourselves beside\r\n  the worn-out governments of Europe--we cannot afford to place\r\n  ourselves on a par with Hayti and Mexico. We are too rich a people\r\n  to do it; and it is a disgrace to us as a nation that we have\r\n  allowed it to continue one single hour beyond the hour when it was\r\n  in our power to remedy the wrong.\r\n\r\n  The proposition to increase our paper currency is a step in the\r\n  wrong direction, and I, for one, am utterly opposed to taking\r\n  even one step in the wrong direction when I know what the right\r\n  direction is.\r\n\r\nAs part of the same general discussion, Mr. Chandler made a carefully\r\nprepared financial speech in the Senate on Feb. 18, 1874, in which\r\nhe first graphically sketched the history of \"wild-cat banking\" in\r\nMichigan, and then said:\r\n\r\n  After the failure of these banks the cry was still, \"More money;\r\n  and we must have more money; the country is suffering for more\r\n  money.\" The cry was responded to, and more money was furnished.\r\n  The Treasury of the State of Michigan, already owing $5,000,000,\r\n  undertook to furnish more money, and the State issued treasury\r\n  notes _ad libitum_, and the \"more money\" men got more money until\r\n  the value of the state treasury notes, which have been paid to the\r\n  last dollar at par, ran down to thirty-seventy cents on the dollar;\r\n  and almost every city in the State, including the city of Detroit,\r\n  responded to the cry of \"more money,\" and issued shin-plasters;\r\n  and individuals, realizing that \"more money\" was needed, issued\r\n  shin-plasters. So the State of Michigan was flooded with more money.\r\n\r\n  Well, sir, you can see at a glance that the State of Michigan\r\n  needed more money. We had as a people been speculating almost to a\r\n  man. It was not confined to the merchant, the banker, the man of\r\n  wealth; but the mechanic, the farmer, the laborer, every man who\r\n  could buy a piece of property of any sort, kind, or description,\r\n  bought it, ran in debt, laid out a town, sold the lots, gave a\r\n  mortgage, and then wanted \"more money\" to pay that mortgage.\r\n\r\n  When the collapse came it was absolute; there was no mistake about\r\n  it; the collapse was perfect. Then the people of Michigan had\r\n  enough of \"more money;\" and when our constitutional convention\r\n  met, as it did a few years later, they put into the constitution a\r\n  clause prohibiting the Legislature forever from chartering a bank\r\n  or affording the means of furnishing \"more money;\" and the people\r\n  acquiesced in it. They had enough of the \"more money\" cry; and for\r\n  twenty-five years there was no more cry in the State of Michigan\r\n  for irredeemable money.... The losses to which I have referred did\r\n  not fall upon the moneyed men of the State of Michigan, the men\r\n  who were in sound condition. They fell upon the laboring man, the\r\n  farmer, and the mechanic. They fell upon the men who could least\r\n  afford to submit to the loss. So it is now. Why, sir, our values\r\n  are fixed by a foreign market, and in coin. There is not a bushel\r\n  of corn or a bushel of wheat raised in Indiana, or Illinois, or\r\n  Michigan, the value of which is not fixed by the foreign value\r\n  in coin of that particular article. When you enhance the cost of\r\n  production by an inferior currency you put that loss upon the\r\n  producer, and the loss falls not upon the wealthy man, but upon the\r\n  laborer and producer. Money will take care of itself all over the\r\n  world. If it is not safe in this country, it will find a country\r\n  where it is safe, and it will go to that country, no matter where\r\n  that may be. Hence, capital requires no protection whatever from\r\n  this body; money will take care of itself; but the poor man, the\r\n  laboring man, the man who submits to all the losses from this\r\n  depreciated currency, is the man who suffers all the pain and all\r\n  the injury that are inflicted by this false legislation....\r\n\r\n  Now, sir, we come to the crash of 1873. On the 15th day of\r\n  September, 1873, this nation was in a more prosperous condition\r\n  than perhaps it had been for the last twenty-five years. Every\r\n  branch of industry was prosperous, every interest of the people\r\n  was prosperous; but in a day, at the drop of the ball at twelve\r\n  o'clock on the 16th of September, the panic struck. What produced\r\n  this tremendous panic and crash in this great and prosperous\r\n  country? It was over-speculating in railroad securities. It was by\r\n  men undertaking to do what it was utterly impossible for them to\r\n  do, to wit, for individuals to float untold millions by their own\r\n  credit; and when the people became alarmed for fear the crash would\r\n  come, the crash came, and there was no salvation from it. But, sir,\r\n  on that very self-same day the nation was more prosperous than it\r\n  had been for the last twenty years in all its interests--business,\r\n  banking and every other. The crash ought not to have extended one\r\n  yard beyond Wall street and the few producers of railroad iron who\r\n  were manufacturing for these defunct railroads. But, sir, the panic\r\n  was so great that it spread until it became universal, and values\r\n  sank until there seemed to be no bottom, and everybody was affected\r\n  throughout the length and breadth of this broad land.\r\n\r\n  But, Mr. President, that panic was of short duration. Many failures\r\n  took place, and particularly among stock and railroad operators;\r\n  but the main business of the country still went on with a few\r\n  notable exceptions. Some manufacturers stopped for the want of\r\n  money; others stopped for the want of credit. The men that had\r\n  been issuing their paper without intending to pay it, issuing\r\n  millions of dollars of paper which they knew they could not meet\r\n  at maturity, trusting in luck to meet their obligations--those\r\n  men cannot borrow money; their lines are full everywhere; nobody\r\n  will loan them money; but, sir, upon undoubted security money is\r\n  to-day cheaper than it has been at any time for the last twenty\r\n  years. These great borrowers, without the expectation of paying at\r\n  maturity, are to-day all out of the market. No man will loan money\r\n  to a person who does not pay at maturity. Every man that desires to\r\n  borrow money for legitimate business can borrow it to-day cheaper\r\n  than he could borrow it at any time in the last twenty years. Sir,\r\n  you may legislate for this class who have over-speculated, you may\r\n  legislate for the benefit of the men who have built factories,\r\n  built steamboats, built mills, bought mills, bought mines, bought\r\n  everything for sale, and given their paper knowing they could not\r\n  meet it unless they could borrow the money over again; you may\r\n  legislate them $100,000,000 or $1,000,000,000, and you will not\r\n  help them in the slightest degree....\r\n\r\n  Now, Mr. President, I will ask the attention of the Senate while\r\n  I show the effect upon the purchasing value of money of issuing\r\n  your greenback circulation from the day it was first issued to the\r\n  present time. In 1862 we commenced the issue of greenbacks. In\r\n  January, 1862, the premium on gold was 2.5 per cent.; in February\r\n  it was 3.5; in March, 1.8; in April, 1.5; in May, 1.3; in June,\r\n  6.5; in July, 15.5; in August, 14.5; in September, 18.5; in\r\n  October, 28.5, in November, 31.1; in December, 32.3. It will be\r\n  remembered that the then circulating medium (which was at that time\r\n  state bank notes) amounted to about $200,000,000. This circulation\r\n  was increased during the year 1862 by the addition of $147,000,000\r\n  in greenbacks, and that increase of circulation carried the value\r\n  of gold from 102.5 on the 1st of January to 132.3 on the 31st day\r\n  of December following.\r\n\r\n  In 1863 the necessities of the government compelled us to increase\r\n  the greenback circulation to a yet larger extent. We issued during\r\n  that year $263,500,000 additional, carrying up our greenback\r\n  circulation to $411,200,000, in addition, of course, to our bank\r\n  circulation, whatever it may have been. During the month of January\r\n  of that year the premium on gold was 45.1 per cent.; during\r\n  February, 60.5; March, 54.5; April, 51.5; May, 48.9; June, 44.5;\r\n  July, 30.6; August, 25.8; September, 34.2; October, 47.7; November,\r\n  48; December, 51.1. In other words, the average rate of premium\r\n  upon gold during that whole year was 45.2 per cent. I hold in my\r\n  hand a paper showing the cash value of this emission for 1863. The\r\n  emission of greenbacks at that time was $411,200,000. The average\r\n  premium on gold was 45.2 per cent. The actual cash purchasing value\r\n  of that $411,000,000, during the year 1863, was $283,195,000, and\r\n  that was the whole purchasing value of that money during that year.\r\n\r\n  Then we come to the next year, 1864. That year, we increased our\r\n  circulating medium by the addition of $237,900,000, making the\r\n  whole amount $649,100,000. In 1864 the price of gold was, in\r\n  January, 155.5; February, 158.6; March, 162.6; April, 172.7; May,\r\n  176.3; June, 219.7; July, 258.1, or less than 40 cents on the\r\n  dollar in coin for your greenbacks after you had carried the amount\r\n  up to $649,000,000. In August the price was 254.1; in September,\r\n  222.5; in October, 207.2; in November, 233.5; in December, 227.5.\r\n  There is not a man here who does not remember, nor is there a\r\n  farmer or mechanic throughout the length and breadth of the land\r\n  who does not remember, that he then paid 60 cents for cotton goods\r\n  that he had been in the habit of buying for 12½ cents, and that he\r\n  paid for everything else in the same ratio. The merchant took care\r\n  that he met with no loss; but the laboring man, the farmer, the man\r\n  of muscle, was the man who submitted to this great loss, while the\r\n  merchant and while every man with money took care of himself.\r\n\r\n  During that year the average price of gold was 203.3 per cent., or\r\n  your money was a fraction less than 48½ cents on the dollar during\r\n  the whole year. You had out that year $649,100,000, and the value\r\n  of gold was 203.3, and the purchasing value of your $649,100,000\r\n  was $319,281,000, and that was the whole of it.\r\n\r\n  In 1865 you again increased the volume of your circulating medium\r\n  by the amount of $49,800,000; making the whole amount of your\r\n  circulation $698,900,000. During the month of January, 1865, the\r\n  price of gold was 216.2; during February, 205.5; in March, 173.8;\r\n  in April, 148.5; and after that it stood at 135.6, 140.1, 142.1,\r\n  143.5, 143.9, 145.5, 147, 146.2. The average of the year 1865 was\r\n  157.3; and what was the purchasing value of your greenbacks that\r\n  year? Every man here will remark that that year we were disposing\r\n  of our bonds at the rate of hundreds of millions of dollars a\r\n  month; money was passing through the Treasury almost without limit.\r\n  We had $1,000,000,000 that must be negotiated, and negotiated at\r\n  once--seven-thirties and compound-interest notes and other floating\r\n  liabilities that must be funded; and during that year the war had\r\n  closed, and while we were negotiating at this enormous rate, the\r\n  price of gold fell to 153.3, and during that year the purchasing\r\n  value of our circulation attained a higher rate than during any\r\n  other year. That year, although our circulation of greenbacks was\r\n  $698,900,000, and the premium on gold 57.3, the actual purchasing\r\n  value of that $698,900,000 was $444,310,000.\r\n\r\n  In 1866 we retired $90,000,000, leaving $608,900,000, and the\r\n  average premium on gold that year was 40.9 per cent. The purchasing\r\n  value of the $608,900,000, with the premium on gold at 40.9, was\r\n  $432,150,000.\r\n\r\n  The next year, 1867, we retired $72,300,000, and premium on\r\n  gold fell to 38.2. So we went on reducing until we got down to\r\n  $400,000,000, and then we struck 14.9, 11.7, 12.4 and 14.7 as the\r\n  premium on gold. There the matter has stood, and I have here from\r\n  year to year, the purchasing value for each year....\r\n\r\n  Mr. President, what we want is purchasing value, because the\r\n  intrinsic value is measured by the purchasing value. There is\r\n  not a bushel of wheat that goes from your State or from mine the\r\n  purchasing value of which is not fixed by the gold value on the\r\n  other side of the Atlantic. We are shipping millions and tens of\r\n  millions and hundreds of millions of our agricultural products\r\n  every year, and the value of these products is fixed in gold on the\r\n  other side of the Atlantic; and yet by this increase of circulation\r\n  we enhance the value of everything that the producer raises, but\r\n  when the product comes to the market its value must be fixed by its\r\n  price in gold across the Atlantic....\r\n\r\n  Mr. President, I know of no way to substitute the Treasury of the\r\n  United States for the banking experience of the last ten centuries.\r\n  We have the experience of the past, we have the experience of our\r\n  own nation, we have the experience of the world. Now, do we propose\r\n  to throw aside this experience, and to launch our boat upon a wild\r\n  and uncertain sea, an ocean of expansion and no payments?\r\n\r\n  Sir, there are very few persons within the range of my acquaintance\r\n  who desire expansion of an irredeemable currency. Certainly the\r\n  people of Michigan have had abundance of experience of that kind.\r\n  But wherever you go you will find two classes of men who are making\r\n  a great noise about \"more money.\" One is the speculator, the\r\n  impecunious speculator, who has, perhaps, bought real estate and\r\n  given a mortgage, and thinks that his only chance is to reduce the\r\n  value of your currency until it falls so low that the people would\r\n  rather take his land than hold your money; and the other is the man\r\n  who has issued his paper without intending to pay when it matures,\r\n  and who can borrow no more money upon any terms until he pays what\r\n  he already owes.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of January, 1875, the act for the resumption of specie\r\npayments became a law. Mr. Chandler was a member of the Senate when\r\nthis bill passed. He had but one objection to it; the time fixed\r\nfor resumption was unnecessarily remote. Neither present exigency\r\nnor needed preparation required the delay, and he believed it to be\r\nopposed alike to economy, patriotism, and public honor. But it was\r\nthe best that could be secured; insistence upon an earlier date would\r\nhave divided the friends of resumption, prevented the passage of any\r\nbill at that time, and postponed the day of specie payments. For these\r\nreasons Mr. Chandler favored the measure, and a few weeks later,\r\nwhen he retired from the Senate, it was with the consciousness that\r\nhe had only voted for an irredeemable and inconvertible currency to\r\nmeet the imperious exigencies of civil war, that he had opposed its\r\nundue expansion, that he had sustained every measure of contraction\r\ncalculated to lessen the difficulties of the return to a sound basis,\r\nand that he finally had crowned his Senatorial career by support\r\nof a measure which insured the return of the government to the\r\nconstitutional standard of values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nSECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR IN THE CABINET OF PRESIDENT GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nEighteen Hundred and Seventy-four was a year of unusual political\r\ndisaster. The prevalent commercial depression both naturally and\r\nseriously injured the party in power, and this and other causes\r\ncombined to produce a general relaxation of Republican vigor, which\r\nbore its inevitable fruit in a series of damaging reverses in the fall\r\nelections throughout the Union. The contest in Michigan was complicated\r\nby an organized movement on the part of the opponents of Prohibition\r\nto secure a repeal of that State's stringent law against the liquor\r\ntraffic, and to more surely reach that end its License League formed\r\nan alliance with the Democracy, by which the latter was greatly aided.\r\nThe result was that the Republican plurality upon the State ticket\r\nwas reduced to 5,969 in a total vote of 221,006, that three of the\r\nnine Congressional districts were carried by the Opposition, and that\r\na Legislature was chosen in which the Republican majority upon joint\r\nballot was but ten. Upon this body, so closely divided, devolved the\r\nchoice of an United States Senator. To a man of Mr. Chandler's positive\r\nqualities and aggressive methods an active public life was impossible\r\nwithout creating strong enmities, and the attention which, had he been\r\nmore subtle, he would have given to conciliating hostility his direct\r\nnature preferred to devote to showing appreciation of friendship. The\r\nequality of parties in the Legislature, and the passing disposition\r\namong Republicans to look with disfavor upon what has been since\r\ntermed \"stalwart leadership,\" supplied the local opposition to Mr.\r\nChandler with the looked-for opportunity for successfully resisting\r\nhis re-election. Michigan Republicanism as a whole gave him its\r\nusual hearty support, and, so far as the contest was waged within\r\nthe recognized lines of partisan warfare, his personal triumph was\r\nflattering and signal. In the regular caucus he received fifty-two\r\nvotes against five ballots cast for three other candidates, and his\r\nnomination was made unanimous with but one dissenting voice. A small\r\nRepublican minority refused to participate in the caucus, and after\r\na prolonged and exciting struggle a combination was formed between\r\nsix of these men and the solid Democratic and Liberal Opposition,\r\nwhich (on the second ballot in the legislative joint convention) gave\r\nprecisely the necessary majority of all the votes cast to Isaac P.\r\nChristiancy, then one of the Justices of the Supreme Court of Michigan.\r\nMr. Christiancy was an original Republican, but had in some instances\r\nin the past so far satisfied the Democrats by his public course that\r\nhe had been once re-elected to the Supreme Bench without opposition,\r\nhis name having been placed at the head of the Democratic State ticket\r\nafter his nomination by his own party. This fact materially facilitated\r\nthe coalition which secured Mr. Chandler's defeat. Like results in\r\npending Senatorial contests in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Nebraska showed\r\nthat more than merely local influences had contributed to bring about\r\nthis event.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler, with that strong faith in his own position which was so\r\nuseful a characteristic of the man, did not believe that his defeat\r\nwas possible until it was accomplished. His disappointment was keen,\r\nbut he bore it manfully, and, assuring his friends that he should be\r\n\"a candidate for _that seat_ when Judge Christiancy's term ended,\" he\r\nstarted for Washington to close up his eighteen years of continuous\r\nSenatorial service. Many and sincere were the expressions of grief\r\namong earnest Republicans everywhere at what seemed to be the abrupt\r\ntermination of the public career of so influential a man. Mr. Chandler\r\nhimself was as strongly affected by his fear that Republicanism might\r\nhave received a severe blow from the method by which his re-election\r\nhad been prevented as by any sense of mere personal failure. In a\r\nletter written in the following March, in response to an invitation\r\nfrom the great majority of the Republican legislators of Michigan to\r\naddress them on political topics, he said:\r\n\r\n  Thanking you cordially for your continued confidence, I assure\r\n  you most sincerely that when I enlisted in the Republican ranks\r\n  it was for the whole war, which, I trust, is to be continued\r\n  until the complete and final triumph of Republican principles,\r\n  the pacification of the whole people, and the establishment of\r\n  equal and exact justice for all men in every section of our common\r\n  country. It will be my pride to prove to my friends, and to my\r\n  enemies, if there are such, that I can be useful as a private\r\n  soldier. In all the future contests of the Republican party with\r\n  its opponents you may order me into the ranks with full confidence\r\n  that I will respond with all my time, if need be, and with such\r\n  ability as I can command.... We shall not yield in the forum the\r\n  great principles which have triumphed in the field, nor shall we\r\n  further waste in internal strife the strength which should be\r\n  organized against our opponents. I have faith in the future of our\r\n  country, because of my confidence in the continued success of the\r\n  Republican party.\r\n\r\nUltimately it became evident that his defeat in 1875 was not a personal\r\ncalamity, he himself afterward saw that it had opened the way for him\r\nto broader fields of public usefulness, and that in what then seemed to\r\nbe a fall he had in fact only \"stumbled up stairs.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the termination of Mr. Chandler's third Senatorial term (on March\r\n3, 1875), his name was connected, both in current rumor and in the\r\ndeliberations of influential men, with several prominent positions.\r\nIt was at one time predicted that he would be nominated for the St.\r\nPetersburg embassy, and at another that he would succeed Mr. Bristow as\r\nSecretary of the Treasury. Ground was not lacking for both reports, but\r\nthe appointment which was actually made involved a far more complete\r\ntest of his faculty of administration than would have attended\r\neither of the others. The Interior Department is the most complex\r\ndivision of the executive branch of the government. A great diversity\r\nof interests are under its charge, and its duties are dissimilar,\r\nwidely ramified, and encumbered with a perplexing multiplicity of\r\ndetails. During President Grant's second term this Department,\r\nnotwithstanding the personal honesty of Secretary Columbus Delano, had\r\nfallen into bad repute. It sheltered abuses and frauds which tainted\r\nthe atmosphere, but were not hunted down and removed by its chiefs.\r\nFrom the scandals which this state of affairs created, Mr. Delano\r\nfinally sought escape by a resignation, which took effect on Oct. 1,\r\n1875. General Grant, who was determined to appoint to the place a man\r\nwhose integrity, sagacity and vigor should make it certain that he\r\nwould not tolerate incompetence and rascality among his subordinates,\r\ntendered the position to Mr. Chandler. After some hesitation, and no\r\nlittle urging by his friends, that gentleman accepted, and on Oct.\r\n19, 1875, his commission as Secretary of the Interior was executed\r\nand sent to him. (His nomination was, on the meeting of Congress in\r\nDecember, promptly confirmed by the Senate, all of the Republican and\r\nthree of the Democratic Senators voting affirmatively, with only six\r\nDemocrats recorded in the negative). Mr. Chandler entered at once\r\nupon the discharge of his new and difficult duties. No man could have\r\nhad less of the professional \"reformer\" about him--in fact he was not\r\nchary of expressing the most contemptuous skepticism concerning much\r\nthat paraded itself as \"reform\"--but the exemplification which he\r\ngave of practical reform was at once thorough and brilliant. Without\r\nostentation, without the faintest savor of cant, he went at his work\r\nin unpretentious, business-like, manful, and clear-sighted fashion. A\r\nfirm believer himself that \"corruption wins not more than honesty,\"\r\nhe gave durable lessons on that theme in every bureau of the Interior\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.[36]]\r\n\r\nThe first step of Mr. Chandler's administration was the infusion of new\r\nblood. He applied to James M. Edmunds for aid in the selection of a\r\nChief Clerk, and was by him advised to tender that important position\r\nto Alonzo Bell, then holding a place in the Treasury. What followed\r\nillustrates some of Mr. Chandler's methods of transacting business:\r\n\r\nMr. Bell, at his desk in the Winder Building, received a dispatch\r\non the afternoon of Nov. 8, 1875, which read: \"The Secretary of the\r\nInterior desires to see you.\" On the next morning at nine o'clock he\r\nwas in waiting in the ante-chamber of Secretary Chandler's office, and\r\nshortly thereafter that gentleman entered. In a few moments Mr. Bell\r\nwas summoned into his room, and Mr. Chandler said, \"Good morning, Mr.\r\nBell. I suppose General Cowen (the then Assistant Secretary) has told\r\nyou what the business with you is?\" Mr. Bell answered, \"I have had a\r\nvery pleasant talk with him, but there has been no business alluded to\r\nby us.\" Mr. Chandler then said, \"I have concluded to appoint you Chief\r\nClerk of the Interior Department; will you accept?\" \"Yes, sir,\" was\r\nthe reply. \"Very well,\" said Mr. Chandler, \"go ahead.\" Mr. Bell went\r\nat once to the Treasury, filed his resignation, and within an hour\r\nreturned to the office of the Secretary of the Interior. He found him\r\nin conference with two Senators, and this conversation followed: \"Mr.\r\nSecretary, I have taken the oath and I am ready to go to work.\" \"Very\r\nwell, do you know where to find the Chief Clerk's room?\" \"No, sir.\"\r\n\"Well, sir, it won't take long to look it up.\" Mr. Bell started on the\r\nsearch for it, and within a few moments had relieved the gentleman\r\ntemporarily in charge, taken possession of its desk, and commenced\r\nbusiness. Mr. Chandler, also on recommendation of Mr. Edmunds, promoted\r\nJohn Stiles from a minor place to the Appointment Clerkship. The\r\nAssistant Secretaryship of the Department he requested the President to\r\ntender to Charles T. Gorham of Michigan, who had lately relinquished\r\nthe embassy of the United States at The Hague. He believed that Mr.\r\nGorham's business training, practical ability and personal attachment\r\nto himself would greatly aid in the reorganization of the Department,\r\nand only felt doubtful as to whether that gentleman would accept the\r\nposition. In the end, Mr. Gorham was induced to take it, and the\r\nAssistant Attorney-Generalship was given to Augustus S. Gaylord of\r\nSaginaw, well-known to Mr. Chandler as a good lawyer and a vigilant\r\nand trustworthy man. These changes in his executive staff the new\r\nSecretary of the Interior regarded as an essential part of the work of\r\ninvestigation and purification which was to be accomplished.[37]\r\n\r\nWithin less than one month after the commencement of Mr. Chandler's\r\nterm, all the clerks in one of the important rooms in the Patent Office\r\nwere summarily removed. Examination had supplied satisfactory proof of\r\ndishonesty in the transaction of the business under their care, and\r\nthe Secretary concluded that all of them were either sharers in the\r\ncorruption or lacked the vigilance necessary for their positions, and\r\nhe declared every desk vacant. To the Hon. Jay A. Hubbell, whom he met\r\non the evening of the day upon which he had taken this vigorous step,\r\nhe said, \"I have been 'reforming' to-day. I have emptied one large room\r\nand have left it in charge of a colored porter, who has the key, who\r\ncannot read and write, and who is instructed to let no one enter it\r\nwithout my orders. I think the public interests are safe so far as that\r\nroom is concerned until I can find some better men to put into it.\" To\r\nthe remonstrances which followed this action he was resolutely deaf,\r\nand to some influential friends of one of the men thus displaced he\r\nsaid significantly, \"That man is competent enough; if he thinks that\r\nthe cause of his removal should be made public, he can be accommodated;\r\nI don't advise him to press it.\" Later in Mr. Chandler's term, and\r\nwithout warning, the monthly pay-rolls of the Patent Office employes\r\nwere placed in the custody of a new officer, and the full name and city\r\naddress of every one who signed them was taken. The result was that for\r\nupward of a score of names no owners appeared, and it was thus found\r\nthat money had been dishonestly drawn in the past by some one through\r\nthe device of fictitious clerkships. It was also ascertained that in\r\na few cases work requiring expert skill had been given to unqualified\r\npersons who had \"farmed it out\" to others at reduced rates, and were\r\nthus receiving pay without rendering service. These disclosures led to\r\nfurther prompt removals of those implicated in the frauds, and to the\r\neradication of the abuses thus exposed. In this bureau some change of\r\nmethods was also made which simplified the transaction of business, and\r\nincreased the facilities for procuring patents while lessening their\r\ncost to the public.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs Mr. Chandler found to be more utterly\r\nunsavory in reputation than any other division of his Department.\r\nBesides securing a new Commissioner and Chief Clerk, he instituted a\r\nseries of quiet inquiries into the methods of doing business there,\r\nand soon determined upon removing a number of subordinates, whose\r\nrecords were unsatisfactory and whose surroundings were suspicious.\r\nHe then sent for the Commissioner and notified him of this decision,\r\nbut that officer replied that they were the most valuable men he had,\r\nand that it would be almost impossible to conduct the business of\r\nthe bureau without them. The urgency of his protest finally induced\r\nMr. Chandler to delay action for a few days. While matters were in\r\nthis state of suspense, President Grant, who was watching with keen\r\ninterest the examination into the Interior Department offices, said\r\nto its Secretary, \"Mr. Chandler, have you removed those clerks in the\r\nIndian Bureau whom we were talking about?\" Mr. Chandler replied, \"No,\r\nsir; the Commissioner said it would be almost impossible to run the\r\noffice without them.\" The President answered, \"Well, Mr. Secretary,\r\nyou can shut up the bureau, can't you?\" The answer was, \"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\"Well then,\" said General Grant, \"have those men dismissed before\r\nthree o'clock this afternoon, or shut up the bureau.\" Mr. Chandler\r\nwent over to the Department, sent for the Commissioner, told him that\r\nthe suspected clerks must go that afternoon if the bureau was closed\r\nas the result, and gave the necessary orders of removal which were\r\npromptly executed. In regard to the dismissal of these men, he said,\r\n\"I haven't evidence that would be regarded in a court as sufficient\r\nto convict them of fraud or dishonesty, but to my mind the proof of\r\ntheir crookedness is strong as Holy Writ.\" This was only one of many\r\ninstances in which President Grant actively interested himself in the\r\nwork of hunting out fraud, and there was no step which Mr. Chandler\r\ntook in the direction of honest and cheaper administration in which he\r\nwas not cordially and powerfully sustained at the White House.\r\n\r\nThe \"Indian Attorneys\" also came under and felt the weight of the new\r\nSecretary's just displeasure. One of the glaring impositions practiced\r\nupon the ignorant aborigines was that of inducing them, winter after\r\nwinter, to send \"agents\" to Washington to look after their interests,\r\nupon representations made to them that the government would otherwise\r\ndeprive them of some of their rights. Many of these men were paid eight\r\ndollars a day and their expenses, while others contracted for certain\r\nsums secured on the property of the Indians. In fact, these \"attorneys\"\r\nrendered no needed service and preyed upon the ignorance of their\r\nclients. These men Mr. Chandler banished from his Department; he also\r\ndeclined to allow the payment of claims preferred by representatives of\r\nthe Indians for \"expenses incurred in procuring legislation,\" on the\r\nground that such outlay was illegal and immoral. His decision on these\r\npoints was embodied in this order (addressed on Dec. 6, 1875, to the\r\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs, and still governing the proceedings of\r\nthat bureau), which saved large sums of money to the Indians:\r\n\r\n  Hereafter no payment shall be made and no claim shall be approved\r\n  for services rendered for or in behalf of any tribe or band of\r\n  Indians in the procurement of legislation from Congress or from any\r\n  State Legislature, or for the transaction of any other business for\r\n  or in behalf of such Indians before this Department or any bureau\r\n  thereof, or before any other Department of the government, and no\r\n  contract for the performance of such services will hereafter be\r\n  recognized or approved by the Indian Office or the Department.\r\n  Should legal advice or assistance be needed in the prosecution or\r\n  defense of any suit involving the rights of any Indian or Indians,\r\n  before any court or other tribunal, it can be procured through the\r\n  Department of Justice.\r\n\r\n  This regulation will govern the Indian Office, and application\r\n  for compensation for such services must not be forwarded to the\r\n  Department for action hereafter, it being understood that the\r\n  regularly-appointed Indian Agent, the Commissioner of Indian\r\n  Affairs and the Secretary of the Interior are competent to protect\r\n  and defend the rights of Indians in all respects, without the\r\n  intervention of other parties, and without other compensation than\r\n  the usual salaries of their respective offices.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler's experience as Secretary of the Interior made him a\r\nfirm believer in President Grant's policy of seeking to civilize\r\nthe American savages by dealing with them through the agency of the\r\nChristian churches. Originally he favored turning the management of\r\nIndian affairs over to the military arm of the government, but actual\r\ncontact with this knotty problem convinced him that the so-called\r\n\"peace policy\" was, with all its conceded imperfections, the true one.\r\nHe held that, if firmly adhered to and improved as experience should\r\ndictate, it would ultimately yield the largest and best returns. To\r\nmake any policy successful he knew that honest and competent service\r\nwas indispensable, and that he spared no efforts to secure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  President Grant.\r\n  Lot M.

Tyner.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT GRANT'S CABINET--1876-'77.\r\n\r\n[From a Sketch by Mrs. C. Adele Fassett.]]\r\n\r\nIn the Pension Bureau there was also some wholesome investigation, and\r\nthe efficiency of its administration and the vigilance of its scrutiny\r\ninto fraudulent claims upon the government were materially increased,\r\nwith the result of saving to the Treasury hundreds of thousands of\r\ndollars annually. In the Land Office a series of extensive frauds in\r\nwhat was known as \"Chippewa half-breed scrip\" were discovered during\r\nthe first six months of Mr. Chandler's term. The matter was one that\r\nhad been brought to the attention of the Department under other\r\nSecretaries, but no detection of rascality had followed. Mr. Chandler\r\nordered a thorough investigation, which was pushed vigorously by Mr.\r\nGorham and Mr. Gaylord. The end was the breaking up of a strong and\r\ncorrupt combination, the prompt removal of all officers connected with\r\nits past operations, and the reporting of the facts to the proper\r\nCongressional committees for further action. The Secretary also ordered\r\na consolidation of the seven stationery divisions of the Department\r\ninto one central office, securing thereby a lessened cost of management\r\nwhich was and is worth $20,000 annually to the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe result of this exhibition of executive vigor need not be described\r\nin detail. Under the impetus of shrewd insight, disciplined business\r\nhabits, and firm purpose, the _morale_ of the various bureaux improved\r\nrapidly. Abuses withered up, inefficiency became industry, and fraud\r\ntook flight.[38] The Interior Department became a strongly-officered\r\nand well-administered branch of the government. Men saw that it had\r\nat last a head who meant that his subordinates should be honest and\r\nshould render efficient service, and who could push his intentions into\r\nacts. Mr. Chandler, who had originally doubted as to whether he could\r\nstill command his old mercantile faculty of mastering and managing a\r\nhost of details, convinced both himself and others that this was still\r\none of his powers. His administration made evident the benefits of the\r\nsupervision of the public business by a practical man of affairs, and\r\nno member of President Grant's Cabinets made a record more enviable for\r\nunostentatious and efficient discharge of duty.\r\n\r\nThe anecdotes of Mr. Chandler's Cabinet service are many and\r\nentertaining. He commenced by arming himself for the chronic battle\r\nof all heads of departments with the claimants of patronage. One of\r\nhis first orders prohibited clerks from recommending applicants for\r\nposition, and another provided him with a statement of the number\r\nof employes in the Department from each Congressional district. A\r\nmemorandum book, containing this information, was constantly by his\r\nside, and was used almost daily. A Congressman would apply for the\r\nappointment to a clerkship of some constituent whom he was anxious to\r\noblige or assist. The record would be produced, and something like this\r\nconversation would follow: \"You see your quota is full, but that don't\r\nmatter; pick out any man you want me to remove and I'll put your man\r\nin his place at once.\" \"But,\" the Congressman would reply, \"I can't\r\ndo that. If I ask you to turn out any of these men I shall get myself\r\ninto hot water.\" \"You don't mean to say that you're asking me to get\r\nmyself into hot water for you?\" the Secretary would answer, and with\r\nthis weapon, thus used half banteringly but still effectively, he,\r\nwith perfect good-nature, turned aside the Congressional pressure for\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nHe also carefully kept memoranda of the official records of his\r\nsubordinates, and charges against any one of them coming from\r\nresponsible sources were certain to be thoroughly investigated. But no\r\nman could be more wrathful at mere backbiting or at efforts for the\r\nsecret undermining of reputation. His repugnance to injustice was no\r\nless keen than his sense of justice. One afternoon a man of clerical\r\naspect and garb called at his office, and said, after introducing\r\nhimself, \"Mr. Chandler, I presume it is your intention to have none but\r\ncorrect people in your Department.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is my intention.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, do you know, sir, that you have a woman in one of the bureaux of\r\nyour Department who is of bad character.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, I do not know that I have any such persons in my Department.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you didn't know it, Mr. Chandler, and so I decided to come\r\nand inform you.\"\r\n\r\nThe name of the clerk in question was then given and the charges\r\nagainst her made still more explicit. Mr. Chandler listened quietly,\r\nand finally picked up a pen and handed it to his caller, saying,\r\n\"Just put that down in writing, sir, and I will dismiss the woman.\"\r\nThe accuser hesitated and said, \"Now, I hope, Mr. Chandler, you will\r\nnot connect my name with this matter. I don't want to be known.\" The\r\nSecretary thereupon leaned back in his chair and said, \"You know all\r\nabout this woman and I know nothing about her, except what you state\r\nto me; but you want me to put a stain on her reputation upon charges\r\nyou are unwilling to even substantiate with your name. Never! Leave\r\nthe office.\" Upon the abrupt departure of the visitor so dismissed,\r\nMr. Chandler turned to one of his clerks and said, \"He belongs to that\r\nclass of informers who are always willing to stand behind and ruin a\r\nperson, but who don't want to be known. I don't propose to be a party\r\nto any such transaction.\"\r\n\r\nA contractor, whose rascality had been conclusively exposed and whose\r\ncontract had been unceremoniously annulled, came to him one day to\r\nremonstrate. The conversation ran in this wise.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Secretary, I have been badly used----\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad of it,\" interrupted Mr. Chandler; \"you're a scoundrel, and\r\nit's time you were getting your deserts.\"\r\n\r\nThe man attempted explanation, but Mr. Chandler was too impatient\r\nto listen, and finally sent him away with orders to write a letter\r\nsetting forth his grievances, which should be investigated. \"Although,\"\r\nadded he, as the contractor retired, \"it's my opinion that the worst\r\ntreatment you could get would be too good for you.\"\r\n\r\nIn the few cases where genuine hardship followed his quick decisions\r\nand their enforcement, he was ready to make good the injury he had\r\nnot intended to inflict. One morning a prominent officer of the army\r\nentered Mr. Chandler's office with a small pamphlet in his hand and\r\nsaid, \"What kind of a fool is it, Mr. Secretary, that you have at your\r\ndoor distributing tracts?\" Upon Mr. Chandler's denying all knowledge\r\nof this variety of colportage, he said, \"Here is a tract a fellow out\r\nthere gave me, and told me to read it, and said it might be good for my\r\nsoul.\" Mr. Chandler was nettled at this violation of discipline, and\r\nmade inquiries which showed that one of the clerks was distributing\r\ntracts about the Department under circumstances that implied neglect of\r\nhis official duties, and thereupon he was dismissed. In a short time\r\nan earnest letter came to the Secretary from the wife of the displaced\r\nman describing the distress that had been brought upon their home,\r\nwhereupon Mr. Chandler directed his re-instatement, saying, as he\r\nissued the order, \"I guess he won't circulate any more tracts. I don't\r\nobject to their distribution, but when a man is doing the government\r\nbusiness he should give that his attention.\" For a clerk discharged\r\nbecause of dishonesty, no amount of personal solicitation, even by\r\nclose friends of Mr. Chandler, availed anything. At one time when he\r\nwas most vehemently and persistently urged to restore a suspected and\r\ndismissed subordinate, he finally said to the Senator who was pressing\r\nthe matter, \"There is but one way by which you can have that man\r\nre-appointed, and that is to first have me turned out.\"\r\n\r\nIn the early part of his term a letter came to Mr. Chandler from a\r\nman in California, who had a case pending before the Department upon\r\nan appeal from the Commissioner of the Land Office. He wrote that if\r\nthe Secretary would decide that case in favor of the appellant, he\r\nwould remit $300 in gold. Mr. Chandler read it and said to his clerk,\r\n\"Call the attention of the Attorney-General to that, cite the law that\r\nman has violated, and ask the Department of Justice to prosecute the\r\nfellow,\" and this course was taken. At about the same time, a dispatch\r\ncame from the Pacific coast stating that a man was at San Francisco who\r\nclaimed to be Mr. Chandler's brother, and was seeking to borrow money\r\non that statement. To this Mr. Chandler's answer was this telegram: \"I\r\nhave no brother. Arrest the scoundrel.\"\r\n\r\nBy the clerks, whose official record satisfied him, he was universally\r\nliked. He was easily approached, ready to listen, quick to perceive,\r\nand prompt in decision. He scarcely ever gave reasons, but his rapid\r\njudgment was rarely found to require reversal or even revision. With\r\nthose who did business with the Department on honest principles,\r\nand only asked for promptitude and efficiency in its service, his\r\npopularity was great and deserved. The fact that he was at its head was\r\nkept constantly fresh in the minds of all. Soon after the commencement\r\nof his term he exchanged offices with the Commissioner of Patents, thus\r\nobtaining an apartment much more desirable than the one previously\r\noccupied by the Secretaries. One of the Patent Office _attaches_, in\r\nreplying to the comment of somebody who expressed surprise at the fact\r\nthat this change had not been sooner made, said, \"To tell the truth we\r\nhave generally regarded the Secretary himself as an interloper in the\r\nDepartment. Mr. Chandler has started a new order of things.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR'S OFFICE.]\r\n\r\nWhile the investigating mania was at its height, the House Committee on\r\nthe Expenditures of the Interior Department determined to look into his\r\nbooks and business system. He accordingly received from them a formal\r\nletter asking what time would be convenient for the investigation. The\r\nChief Clerk submitted this communication to Mr. Chandler, who said,\r\n\"Tell them to come down any day, and I want you to put the best room\r\nwe have at their disposal, and give them all the facilities you can\r\nto investigate the affairs of any bureau of the Department that they\r\nwant to look into. If they can find anything wrong that I haven't\r\nfound, I shall be very much obliged to them. They will be pumping a dry\r\nwell. The work is done.\" The committee came, but only held a few brief\r\nsessions, and finally never concluded their labors and never made a\r\nreport in relation thereto.\r\n\r\nActive as were Mr. Chandler's party sympathies, and little disposed\r\nas he was to consult his political opponents as to his course, or to\r\nadmit them to any share in the patronage at his disposal, he did not\r\nmanage the Department upon merely partisan principles. He did not\r\nmake removals of Democratic subordinates except for cause; he never\r\nappointed any Republican whom he did not believe to be thoroughly\r\nupright and competent. That to fill any vacancy he always sought to\r\nfind the right kind of Republican was true. His civil service theories\r\nstopped with honesty and efficiency, and did not exclude pronounced\r\npolitical sympathy with the appointing power nor party activity.\r\nStill, he did not on any occasion enforce the payment of political\r\nassessments by his subordinates, and their work for the Republican\r\ncause was left voluntary in character. The nearest approach to mere\r\npartisanship in his use of the appointing power was the giving of\r\nplaces in the Department to crippled soldiers who had been discharged\r\nfrom the employment of the House of Representatives by the Democratic\r\nDoor-keeper, and even in that it was far more the indignation of the\r\npatriot than of the Republican that stirred him. At the close of Mr.\r\nChandler's Secretaryship, the clerks of the Department waited upon\r\nhim in a body, and thanked him for the kindness they had received at\r\nhis hands. While farewells were being exchanged Mr. Schurz, the new\r\nSecretary, came in and was introduced to his staff of subordinates. Mr.\r\nChandler then said:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Secretary, I welcome you to this office. When I came here this\r\n  Department was greatly tainted with corruption, especially in the\r\n  Patent Office and the Indian Bureau. With the aid of the gentlemen\r\n  you see around you, I have been able to cleanse it, and I believe,\r\n  as far as I am able to ascertain, that no abuses exist in the\r\n  bureaux I have named. I had to use the knife freely, and I believe\r\n  this Department stands to-day the peer of any department of the\r\n  government.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler further commended the corps of employes as honest,\r\nfaithful men, and Mr. Schurz replied:\r\n\r\n  I think I am expressing the general opinion of the country when\r\n  I say you have succeeded in placing the Interior Department in\r\n  far better condition than it had been in for years, and that the\r\n  public is indebted to you for the very energetic and successful\r\n  work you have performed. I enter upon the arduous duties with which\r\n  I have been entrusted with an earnest desire to discharge them\r\n  conscientiously, and I shall be happy when leaving the Department\r\n  to have achieved as good a reputation for practical efficiency as\r\n  you have won. I thank you, sir, for this cordial welcome, and I\r\n  will say to the gentlemen to whom you have introduced me that they\r\n  shall have my protection; and I ask from them the same faithful\r\n  assistance they have given you.\r\n\r\nThe tribute which Secretary Schurz at the outset thus paid to the\r\npractical efficiency of his predecessor merely expressed the public\r\nverdict which greeted the close of Mr. Chandler's term. Examination\r\ndid not compel any modifying of this praise, and after Mr. Chandler's\r\ndeath his successor in the Interior Department--a man very exacting\r\nin judgment and one with whom his political differences had been\r\nnumerous--again said: \"In the course of the last two years I have\r\nfrequently discovered in the transaction of public business traces of\r\nhis good judgment and his energetic determination to do what was right.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[36] This massive edifice is popularly known as \"The Patent Office,\"\r\nbecause its main halls are occupied by the magnificent model rooms of\r\nthe Bureau of Patents.\r\n\r\n[37] Much of Secretary Chandler's confidence arises from the well-known\r\nintegrity and personal reliability of the several gentlemen sustaining\r\nthe nearest official relation to him, all of whom were selected by\r\nhis own free choice, and from his own personal knowledge of these\r\nessential characteristics. General Gorham did not seek the office of\r\nAssistant Secretary; the office sought him, and Mr. Chandler himself\r\nwould take no denial. So, also, of Mr. Gaylord, his able and untiring\r\nAssistant Attorney-General for the department. And the same is true of\r\nMr. Partridge, his discreet and trusted private secretary. Surrounded\r\nby such aids he well knows that no material interest can suffer by any\r\ntemporary contingency, such as the one which now occurs.--_Washington\r\ndispatch to the Philadelphia \"City Item\" of Oct. 20, 1875_ (_referring\r\nto Mr. Chandler's temporary absence_).\r\n\r\n[38] No appointment was ever more thoroughly justified by the result\r\nthan Mr. Chandler's. It gave him a new field for his energy and his\r\nmasterly executive ability, and it is conceded that he made the best\r\nSecretary of the Interior that the nation has had in our day. He made\r\nno boasts of what he intended to accomplish, but instituted reforms and\r\nuprooted abuses. He hated dishonest men, and they feared him.--_Gen. J.\r\nR. Hawley, in the \"Hartford Courant.\"_\r\n\r\nOn no occasion was Mr. Chandler known to use his official position for\r\nhis own pecuniary gain--directly or indirectly. His death has ended a\r\nlong career of public service in executive and legislative capacities,\r\nand throughout his hands were ever clean of unjust or illegitimate\r\ngain--nor did his bitterest political foe (and no man evoked stronger\r\npersonal criticism) ever charge, or ever suspect him, with making\r\npersonal profit out of his political station and opportunities.--_T. F.\r\nBayard in the Senate, Jan. 28, 1880._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1876--AT HOME--THE MARSH FARM NEAR LANSING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Michigan delegation to the Cincinnati Convention of 1876 selected\r\nMr. Chandler as the member of the National Republican Committee\r\nfor their State, and at the first formal meeting of that body (at\r\nPhiladelphia, early in July) he was chosen its chairman after a close\r\ntriangular contest between his friends and those of the Hon. A. B.\r\nCornell and Gen. E. F. Noyes. The committee at once opened rooms at\r\nthe Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York, with its Secretary, the Hon. R. C.\r\nMcCormick of Arizona, in immediate charge. Mr. Chandler made frequent\r\nvisits to the headquarters throughout the campaign, superintending the\r\ngeneral plan of operations and meeting with the executive committee; as\r\nelection-day approached his attendance became more constant.\r\n\r\nOriginally he felt confident of Republican victory, not believing that\r\nin the centennial year the American people would render a political\r\nverdict whose result would be the restoration of the disloyal classes\r\nof the South to national supremacy. But, in September, evidences of\r\nRepublican apathy in the important States of Ohio and Indiana--more\r\nespecially in the former, which was the home of the Presidential\r\ncandidate--greatly disturbed him, and made it plain that the situation\r\nwas critical. It had become evident that organized brutality would give\r\nall the close Southern States to the Democrats and even make doubtful\r\nthose which were strongly Republican, and that the merchantable and\r\ncriminal classes of New York city would be so used as to also cast the\r\nelectoral vote of that great State for the Opposition. The gravity of\r\nthe prospect then brought out Mr. Chandler's best qualities of party\r\nleadership. Prompt aid was rendered in Ohio, and the National Committee\r\ndid more than its full share (Mr. Chandler making large personal\r\nadvances) to carry that State in the important October election.\r\nAfter the serious loss of Indiana, measures were at once instituted\r\nto organize the party for decisive work on the Pacific Slope, to see\r\nthat in those Southern States where there was any hope all lawful\r\nmeasures were taken to defeat the plans of \"the rifle clubs\" and \"the\r\nwhite leagues,\" and to carry New York if that was possible. Nothing was\r\nspared that would arouse the spirit of the party, and Mr. Chandler saw\r\nthat the means were forthcoming for every effort that promised to make\r\nsuccess more certain.\r\n\r\nThe elections showed that the calculations of the managers of the\r\nRepublican campaign were accurate, and were also adequate to \"snatching\r\nvictory from the jaws of defeat.\" The effort to save New York failed,\r\nand it and the neighboring States rewarded with their electoral votes\r\nthe unscrupulous and subtle skill of Governor Tilden's personal\r\ncanvass. But the Republican victories beyond the Rocky Mountains,\r\nand the resolute resistance offered in South Carolina, Louisiana and\r\nFlorida, to the seizure of those States by political crimes ranging\r\nfrom shameless fraud to wholesale massacre, still left success with the\r\nRepublicans after a contest without an American parallel in obstinacy,\r\nbitterness and excitement. Mr. Chandler showed throughout the prolonged\r\nelectoral dispute \"the courage which mounteth with the occasion,\" and\r\nhis firmness, vigor and activity were among the important factors in\r\nthe work of saving the fruits of the so narrowly-won victory. As soon\r\nas the smoke lifted from the battle-field his dispatch appeared, \"Hayes\r\nhas 185 votes and is elected,\" and he maintained that position to the\r\nend without a shade of faltering. Knowing that the Republicans were\r\nrightfully entitled to the electoral votes of, at least, Mississippi,\r\nAlabama, Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina, he determined that in\r\nthe three States where the existence of Republican officials afforded\r\nsome ground for hope nothing should be left undone to deprive fraud and\r\nviolence of their prey, and he pushed every measure which seemed needed\r\nto uphold the Republicans of Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina\r\nin their lawful rights. In some of the important closing phases of\r\nthis exciting contest his counsels were not followed. The Electoral\r\nCommission act was not a measure that he approved. Firmly believing\r\nin the constitutional power of the President of the Senate to count\r\nthe electoral votes and announce the result, he held the position that\r\nthat officer should discharge that duty, and that the candidate thus\r\nconstitutionally declared elected should be duly inaugurated at all\r\nhazards; and revolutionary threats were without effect upon his firm\r\npurpose. The negotiations between the opposing party leaders which\r\nattended the closing hours of the struggle, and which culminated in\r\nthe abandonment by the new administration of the Republican State\r\ngovernments of the South, received no sanction from him. He regarded\r\nsuch a policy as essentially perfidious, and as clouding the title\r\nof Mr. Hayes to his high office, a title which Mr. Chandler believed\r\nto be as clear as that possessed by any President chosen since the\r\nformation of the constitution. Much else that attended the surrender\r\nof the South to the bitter enemies of the republic he deprecated as\r\nexceedingly harmful to the party of his faith, as unwise in tendency,\r\nand as unjust in principle. He was not demonstrative in his criticisms\r\nupon the new \"policy,\" and his retirement to private life enabled him\r\nto maintain a general silence upon the subject. But his disapproval of\r\na \"conciliation,\" which he regarded as cowardly in its treatment of\r\nfriends and as foolish in its manifestation of undeserved confidence\r\nin enemies, was profound.[39] Within two years the vindication of his\r\nopinions was complete.\r\n\r\nThe indebtedness of the Republicans to Mr. Chandler's attitude and\r\nefforts in the presidential election of 1876 and the subsequent\r\nelectoral dispute can scarcely be exaggerated. Without his firmness,\r\nthe spirit with which he held his party up to the thorough assertion\r\nof its rights, the liberality with which he advanced the large sums\r\nrequired for legitimate expenditures, and the influence of his\r\nindomitable resolution, the final victory would have been at least\r\nvastly more difficult of attainment, if not actually impossible. In\r\nhim the enemy never found the slightest traces of failing will or\r\nflagging strength. While the excitement was at its height, a Democratic\r\nperiodical published a cartoon, in which Mr. Chandler was caricatured\r\nas standing colossus-like over a yawning chasm, holding up an elephant,\r\nlabeled \"The Republican Vote,\" by a double-handed grasp upon its tail.\r\nThe humor of the rough sketch greatly delighted its subject, and he\r\nkept it with him for the entertainment of his friends. He first saw it\r\nafter one of the Cabinet sessions, when it was produced by President\r\nGrant and passed through the hands of the other Secretaries, until\r\nit reached Mr. Chandler, who, after looking it over, said, gravely\r\npointing out his position in the cartoon: \"Mr. President, one of three\r\nthings is certain: either the rocks upon which my feet are resting\r\nwill crumble, or the elephant's tail will break, or I shall land the\r\nanimal.\" Into the methods of his work he never feared examination. No\r\ncipher dispatch disclosures have cast infamy upon his name, and eager\r\ninvestigation by his political enemies still left his personal honor\r\nuntainted.\r\n\r\nAfter the conclusion of Mr. Chandler's term of Cabinet service, he\r\nremained in Washington for several weeks, and then accompanied General\r\nGrant to Philadelphia, and was one of the party who escorted the\r\nEx-President down the Delaware when, on May 17, 1877, he commenced his\r\ntour around the world. The next two years were spent by Mr. Chandler\r\nin Michigan. His only prolonged absence from his Detroit home during\r\nthis period was caused by a two months' trip to the California coast\r\nin June and July of 1877. A special car was placed at his service by\r\nthe Pacific Railroads (he was one of the earliest and most energetic\r\nsupporters of the trans-continental railway project), and he was\r\naccompanied by Charles T. Gorham of Marshall, H. C. Lewis of Coldwater,\r\nand S. S. Cobb of Kalamazoo. Denver, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, San\r\nFrancisco, and the Yo Semite Valley were visited during the journey,\r\nand everywhere Mr. Chandler was welcomed with noteworthy public\r\nand private entertainments; his attractive social qualities shone\r\nthroughout the jaunt. Not a great traveler, yet he saw during his life\r\nmuch of the world. In 1875, in company with Senators Cameron, Anthony\r\nand others, he visited the leading cities of the South. During one of\r\nthe Congressional recesses of his second term, he passed some months\r\nin Europe, and while still in active business he spent a winter in the\r\nWest Indies. His knowledge of the resources and points of interest of\r\nthe Worth and Northwest was extensive and thorough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAT OF THE MARSH FARM.[40]]\r\n\r\nThe marsh farm, which Mr. Chandler bought near the city of Lansing,\r\nand the experiments in extensive and systematic drainage which he made\r\nthereon, always received a generous share of his attention when he was\r\nin Michigan. This enterprise was one in which he unhesitatingly made\r\nlarge investments with the view of settling definitely questions of\r\nmanifest public importance. In 1857 the State of Michigan gave to its\r\nAgricultural College the public lands in the four townships of Bath, De\r\nWitt, Meridian, and Lansing, which were designated on the surveyor's\r\nmaps as \"swamp lands;\" in the main the sections covered by the grant\r\nwere marshy, although their rectilinear boundaries included some solid\r\nground. Mr. Chandler purchased from the college and other owners a farm\r\nof 3,160 acres, located four miles (by railroad) from Lansing, in the\r\ntowns of Bath and De Witt in Clinton county; it included about 1,900\r\nacres of marsh meadow, 500 acres of tamarack swamp, and 800 acres of\r\noak-opening uplands. The marsh was traversed by a slender water-course,\r\ndeviously connecting some small lakes with a stream known as the\r\nLooking-glass river. The upland portion of the farm was thoroughly\r\nfertile, but its development and cultivation did not specially interest\r\nMr. Chandler, except as furnishing the needed base for his experiments\r\nupon the marsh. He said: \"Michigan contains thousands of acres of\r\nprecisely this kind of land. The drainage of this particular marsh is\r\ndifficult, as much so as is the case with any land in this peninsula\r\nwhich is not a hopeless swamp. If this tract can be reclaimed, others\r\ncan be, and I propose to give the experiment of reclamation a thorough\r\ntrial. I have the money, and I believe I have the pluck. If I succeed,\r\nit will be a good thing for the State, for it will show how to add\r\nmillions of dollars worth of land to its farms. If I fail, it will\r\nalso be a good thing, for it will settle an open question, and no man\r\nneed repeat my attempt.\" He pushed this experiment vigorously from the\r\ntime of its commencement until his death, and gave to it his frequent\r\npersonal supervision: His investments in the marsh farm soon came to\r\nbe counted by many tens of thousands of dollars. Originally, practical\r\nfarmers were inclined to regard his operations as sheer folly, but as\r\nthey saw the purpose, methods and thoroughness of his work, a just\r\nappreciation of its aim followed. Mr. Chandler never disguised the\r\ncharacter of this enterprise. Repeatedly he said to visitors at the\r\nfarm and to friends, \"I have a theory--that is a remarkably expensive\r\nthing to have--and I propose to test it here; it will make me poorer,\r\nbut it may make others richer some time.\" The public value of his\r\nexperiment he believed to be great, and that fact he was quick to make\r\nprominent whenever it seemed necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE \"BIG DITCH\" (WINTER SCENE).]\r\n\r\nThe general plan of drainage operations consisted in connecting by\r\na large ditch Park lake (which has an area of 235 acres) with the\r\nLooking-glass river. This main ditch was constructed by straightening\r\nthe bed of Prairie creek, and possessed descent enough to ensure a slow\r\ncurrent in wet seasons. It is about four miles in length, and averages\r\nfourteen feet in width by four in depth. At intervals of forty rods\r\nare constructed lateral ditches, as a rule five feet in width at the\r\ntop by three in depth. This part of the work had not been completed at\r\nthe time of Mr. Chandler's death, but still the lateral ditching had\r\nreached about fifty miles in aggregate length, and had well drained\r\nabout 1,000 acres in the western end of the marsh near the outlet into\r\nthe Looking-glass. In that portion of the farm the first results of\r\nthe drainage--the rotting down of the peaty surface of the marsh into\r\na vegetable mold--have already manifested themselves satisfactorily.\r\nThe extent to which this decomposition will continue is not completely\r\ntested, nor does it yet appear what will be the full measure of the\r\narability of soil, which will be created by this process, supplemented\r\nby the tile draining which will follow the subsidence of the marsh to\r\na permanent level. This peaty surface varies from two and a half feet\r\nto a rod in depth and promises to become an enormously productive soil.\r\nThe experiments thus far tried upon it have resulted hopefully. Much\r\nof the native grass furnished excellent hay, and stock fatted upon it\r\nthoroughly with no more than the usual allowance of grain. The tame\r\ngrass sown was chiefly Fowl Meadow and Timothy. The former Mr. Chandler\r\nhad seen growing in Holland on reclaimed land, and he determined to\r\ngive it a trial; he was only able to find the seed in the Boston\r\nmarket, and there paid for it four dollars per bushel of eleven pounds.\r\nIt is a species of Red Top, and soon yielded from one and a half to\r\ntwo tons of excellent hay per acre. For four seasons this seeding-down\r\nwith tame grasses was tried with satisfactory results, and then other\r\nexperiments followed. In the fall of 1878, twelve acres of marsh, then\r\nwell seeded-down with grass, were thoroughly plowed by Superintendent\r\nHughes, who, in the following season, raised thereon corn, potatoes,\r\nrutabagas and oats. The results conclusively showed that the marsh\r\npossessed general productiveness, although the experiment itself was\r\nmarred by the unseasonable frosts of 1879. The corn looked well at\r\nthe outset, but was severely injured in the end. The potato crop was\r\na good one, and the yield of oats was also large. In the fall of 1879\r\nanother tract of twelve acres was plowed, and the same experiment was\r\nput in process of repetition. Superintendent Hughes is of the opinion\r\nthat within another year, the reclaimed marsh will produce 100 bushels\r\nof corn to the acre. A short time before his death, Mr. Chandler said\r\nthat, in view of the success which had attended the experiments already\r\ntried, he now felt confident that in time his farm would be pointed\r\nout as an ague-bed transformed into one of the most valuable pieces of\r\nproperty in Central Michigan, and would demonstrate the reclaimability\r\nof large tracts of swamp land in that State. About 500 acres of the\r\nmarsh are seeded with Fowl Meadow grass; about 300 acres of this is\r\nmowed, and the remainder is used for pasturage. Over 400 tons of\r\nexcellent hay were cut there in the season of 1879.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SUPERINTENDENT'S HOUSE AT THE MARSH FARM.]\r\n\r\nOutside of the interest attaching to it by reason of the drainage\r\nexperiments, the Chandler farm would deserve notice as one of the\r\nmost thoroughly equipped and stocked of the new farms of Michigan.\r\nIt is traversed by a state road, and by the Jackson, Lansing and\r\nSaginaw Railroad (which has established a signal station near the\r\nfarm-house). Its buildings are located upon the highest ground. They\r\nare substantially constructed, and surrounded with all the evidences\r\nof thrift. The main house of the farm, which is occupied by the\r\nsuperintendent and his family, is a commodious frame structure, two\r\nstories in height, and conveniently partitioned off into spacious\r\nand airy apartments. Near it is the house-barn (32 by 54 feet in\r\ndimensions) with sheep-sheds adjoining. About a half-mile to the east\r\nare two tenant houses, occupied by families employed on the farm. On\r\nthe east side of the state road, at a distance of half a mile, is a\r\nlarge barn, erected in 1879; its main portion is 41 by 66 feet in\r\ndimensions, with a wing 38 by 90 feet; its height is 44 feet to the\r\nridge; attached are sheds 250 feet in length and \"L\" shaped. This\r\nbarn is largely used for storage purposes, and will receive 250 tons\r\nof hay. The basement of its wing is divided into 60 cattle stalls, 30\r\non each side, with a broad passage through the center. The stalls are\r\ningeniously arranged in the most improved style, and with a special\r\nregard for cleanliness. In the basement of the main barn is a large\r\nroot cellar (capable of holding 2,000 bushels of potatoes, turnips,\r\netc.), stabling accommodations for eight horses, two large box-stalls\r\nfor stallions, a feed-room 20 by 25 feet in size, numerous calf-pens,\r\nand many other conveniences. Located above are two granaries, each\r\n12 by 28 feet in dimensions. Attached to the barn, but in a separate\r\nbuilding, is a 12-horse-power engine, used for cutting feed, and for\r\nother farm purposes. A large automatic windmill and pump supply water\r\nin abundance.\r\n\r\nThe farm is well stocked; on it are seventeen horses, including \"Mark\r\nAntony,\" an imported Normandy stallion, which is a fine specimen of the\r\nPercheron breed. There are also 120 head of handsome graded cattle on\r\nthe farm, 300 sheep graded from Shropshire Down bucks, and 23 pure-bred\r\nEssex swine. In wagons and implements of every kind the equipment\r\nis complete, and all are of the best manufacture and most improved\r\nquality. The force of laborers on the farm as a rule includes five men\r\nin summer and three in winter, large gangs being employed during the\r\ntwo months of the haying season, and also when there is any extensive\r\nfencing or ditching enterprise to be pushed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MAIN BARN OF THE MARSH FARM.]\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler's experiments were closely watched by the farmers of\r\nMichigan. Visits were frequent from them singly, in small parties,\r\nand in club or grange excursions to the marsh, and they always met a\r\nhospitable reception. Letters of inquiry also came from many parts of\r\nthe State, giving evidence of the widespread character of the interest\r\nfelt. Mr. Chandler himself when in Michigan visited the farm at least\r\nonce a month, inspecting the work thoroughly, discussing plans with the\r\nsuperintendent, making suggestions, and giving orders. His experience\r\nas a farmer in his boyhood furnished ideas which were yet useful and\r\na judgment which was well-informed; still he was ready to welcome all\r\ninnovations that promised good results, and he closed many discussions\r\nwith his superintendents by remarking, \"If you come at me with facts,\r\nthat is enough; I never argue against them.\" At the farm he also\r\nfound the most congenial relaxation. He would come there jaded out\r\nwith the excitement and labor of political contest and public life;\r\nin stout clothing and heavy boots he would scour the meadows, examine\r\nditching, look up the stock, oversee labor, and work himself if there\r\nwas an inviting opportunity. A day or two of this life would bring\r\nrest, hearty appetite, and sound sleep, would relieve his nerves from\r\ntension, and restore his vital powers to their natural activity. He\r\nalways rated his visits to the marsh farm as a certain and delightful\r\ntonic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. CHANDLER'S RESIDENCE IN WASHINGTON.]\r\n\r\nIn private life Mr. Chandler kept up the habits which marked his public\r\ncareer. His voluminous correspondence was never neglected. Napoleon's\r\nmethod of leaving letters unopened for three weeks, because within\r\nthat time most of them would need no replies, he reversed. As a rule,\r\nevery communication addressed to Mr. Chandler was promptly answered;\r\nto even mere notes of compliment brief responses were sent. Of course\r\nthis practice made a confidential secretary indispensable, and that\r\nposition was held for some years by a Mr. Miller; after his death (in\r\n1870) it was discreetly and faithfully filled by George W. Partridge.\r\nMatters entrusted to Mr. Chandler's care by constituents always\r\nreceived early attention; the same statement is true of applications\r\nfrom the humblest stranger who preferred a claim upon his attention,\r\nand it includes political enemies as well as friends. Mr. Chandler\r\nregarded meeting these demands as part of his public duties; no other\r\nprominent man of his day gave to such matters a tithe of the time and\r\nenergy devoted to them by him, and this was one source of his hold upon\r\nthe popular affection. Of course much labor was involved, but this was\r\noffset by the fact that in all his duties he was regular, punctual\r\nand systematic; his mercantile training helped him greatly in this\r\nrespect, and it was said of him truly, \"He has never been excelled as\r\na 'business Senator' at Washington.\" While not a student, he was a man\r\nwho prepared for every important action. In his speeches he aimed at\r\nnervous strength and effectiveness. For oratorical finish he cared\r\nnothing, but simple language, terse sentences, some plain word whose\r\nmeaning was an argument in itself--these he sought for unceasingly.\r\nHe apologized for the length of one of his brief speeches because he\r\nhad not had time to make it shorter. Not rarely he would put into a\r\nsentence of ten Saxon words the power of a philippic, and this rough\r\nmissile would crush where mere rhetoric would have only irritated. Mr.\r\nChandler never failed as a speaker to command the popular attention,\r\nand his force and the simplicity of his diction were greatly aided\r\nby the sincerity which illuminated them. The vigor and truth of\r\nconviction, which made him so ardent a champion of the party of his\r\npolitical faith, marked his speeches, and made his appeals potent with\r\nhis hearers. \"His words were simple and his soul sincere.\" In fact,\r\nhis sincerity and honesty were the salient qualities of the man. His\r\nwas not a faultless character; but it was above baseness, and it was\r\nfree from affectation, from cant, and from hypocrisy. The record of his\r\npublic life recalls Emerson's estimate of Bonaparte: \"This man showed\r\nus how much may be accomplished by the mere force of such virtues as\r\nall men possess in less degree--namely, by punctuality, by personal\r\nattention, by courage, and by thoroughness.\" But more honorable to his\r\nmemory is the fact that concerning the man himself can be justly quoted\r\nCarlyle's eloquent tribute to Burns: \"He is an honest man.... In his\r\nsuccesses and his failures, in his greatness and his littleness, he is\r\never clear, simple and true, and glitters with no lustre but his own.\r\nWe reckon this to be a great virtue--to be, in fact, the root of most\r\nother virtues.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. CHANDLER'S RESIDENCE IN DETROIT.] a game of\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler's social nature was a hearty one. His manners were easy,\r\nhe was affable with all, and he was without the slightest tinge of\r\naristocratic tastes or prejudice. No false dignity surrounded him; with\r\nhis friends his laugh was ready; he liked whist, enjoyed a good story,\r\nfound pleasure in social gatherings, was entertaining in conversation,\r\nand easily gave way to the natural jollity of his spirits. Exact\r\nand stern as he often was, his intimates found him a most agreeable\r\ncompanion Few men have ever bound friends to themselves more firmly.\r\n\r\nHe surrounded his homes with the comforts that wealth could supply,\r\nand yet was not ostentatious. His Washington residence he purchased\r\nfor about $40,000 in 1867 from Senor Bareda, the Peruvian Minister.\r\nIt is located on H between Thirteenth and Fourteenth streets, and is\r\na handsome house with spacious parlors and dining room upon the first\r\nfloor; commodious apartments occupy the upper stories, which are\r\nconnected by rich staircases of black walnut. Mr. Chandler's office\r\nwas located in the basement, and has been the scene of many important\r\nconsultations between famous men on questions of party policy and\r\npublic concern. His Detroit home was the mansion on the Northwest\r\ncorner of Fort and Second streets, which he built in 1855-'56. It\r\nis situated in spacious grounds, and is of the plain Roman style of\r\narchitecture, which aims at the simple in outline and massive in\r\neffect. A semi-circular drive and path lead to it through the gate-ways\r\nof a heavy and handsome fence and into a large _porte cochere_. Thence\r\nwide stone steps rise through solid mahogany doors to a broad hall,\r\nwhose floor of inlaid woods is partly hidden by rich rugs. On the\r\nright is the drawing room, a spacious apartment furnished in blue and\r\ngold, and abounding in tasteful ornaments and handsome paintings. In\r\nit stands Randolph Rogers's marble bust of Mr. Chandler, executed\r\nabout 1870. Opposite and connected by folding doors are the library\r\nand dining room. The former's shelves are well filled with the best\r\nworks of standard authors, including many ancient chronicles seldom\r\nfound in private book collections. Back of the dining room and across\r\na transverse hallway is the apartment that was Mr. Chandler's private\r\noffice; its walls are literally covered with shelving containing\r\nCongressional annals and reports and many public documents. The\r\nappointments of the numerous other rooms are tasteful and complete,\r\nand all the surroundings of the house are in keeping with its quiet\r\nelegance. In 1858 Mr. Chandler met there with an accident of nearly\r\nfatal results. He followed his little daughter upon a search for some\r\nescaping gas, and was caught with her in a room in which a large mass\r\nof that inflammable vapor was exploded by a lighted candle. To add\r\nto the danger of the situation the door was closed upon them by a\r\nfrightened servant. Mr. Chandler seized his child and sheltered her\r\nfrom serious danger, and groped his way out blinded and scorched. It\r\nwas then found that his hands and face were badly burned, and the loss\r\nof his eyesight was threatened. Careful treatment and his vigorous\r\nconstitution ultimately brought about a full recovery, and the only\r\ntraces left of the casualty were some slight affections of the facial\r\nmuscles and an unusual pallor of countenance.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler's domestic life was a thoroughly happy one. He married\r\nLetitia Grace Douglass of New York, a noble Christian woman, whose\r\nsocial accomplishments blended dignity with grace, and who met to the\r\nfull her large share of the exacting duties attendant upon public\r\nlife and high station. Their only child was a daughter, Mary Douglass\r\nChandler, who was married, while her father was a Senator, to the Hon.\r\nEugene Hale of Ellsworth, Maine. She inherited many of her father's\r\ntraits, and his affection for her was rooted in the inner fibres of his\r\nstrong nature. Her children, his three little grandsons, often knew him\r\nas a rollicking playfellow, and he counseled with her freely and often,\r\nand she shared in his confidence as well as his love. Throughout his\r\nlife he expressed his appreciation of the devoted attachment of his\r\nwife and child by many acknowledgments that do not belong to a public\r\nchronicle; his will left his great estate to them as his sole heirs,\r\n\"share and share alike.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[39] In the fall of 1877 Mr. Chandler delivered the annual address\r\nbefore the Branch County Agricultural Society, and while in Coldwater\r\nwas the guest of the Hon. Henry C. Lewis of that city, who invited a\r\nfew friends to meet him socially. In the course of the conversation\r\nMr. Chandler said that he was going to his Lansing farm to spend a few\r\ndays. His reticence in regard to the Hayes administration was then a\r\nmatter of remark, and the Hon. C. D. Randall said to him: \"Well, Mr.\r\nChandler, when you get out in the center of your great farm and alone,\r\nyou will have a fine opportunity to express your opinion about the\r\nHayes 'policy.'\" Mr. Chandler's reply was: \"No, sir; that Lansing farm\r\nwill never answer my purpose. To do that I shall have to be on the top\r\nof a high hill behind the meeting-house and with the wind blowing the\r\nother way!\" The audience responded with a hearty laugh.\r\n\r\n[40] The heavy black lines in this map are the boundaries of the\r\nfarm; the waving lines indicate the border of the uplands surrounding\r\nthe marsh.

CHANDLER'S RETURN TO THE\r\nSENATE--\"THE JEFF. DAVIS SPEECH.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe township elections in Michigan in April, 1878, revealed an\r\nastonishing growth in the number of the advocates of an irredeemable\r\npaper currency. \"Hard times,\" Democratic disgust over the result of\r\nthe electoral dispute, and Republican disappointment at \"the Southern\r\npolicy\" of the new administration greatly relaxed existing party ties,\r\nand made the way ready for the expounders of the seductive theory\r\nthat prosperity depends upon a great volume of the currency, and\r\nthat large issues of paper bearing the government stamp must greatly\r\nadd to individual wealth. Throughout the West and South, Republican\r\nand Democratic leaders had fostered these fallacious ideas, and thus\r\nprepared the field of public sentiment for this \"Greenback\" sowing. In\r\nMichigan the result was that the National party (which in 1876 gave\r\nonly 9,060 votes to Peter Cooper for President) in April, 1878, cast\r\nover 70,000 votes for its township candidates, elected a large number\r\nof supervisors in the most populous counties of the State, and showed\r\ngreater strength than either of the old parties in four Congressional\r\ndistricts. This was the gravest situation the Republicans of Michigan\r\nhad ever been called upon to face. A conference of their representative\r\nmen was at once held, at the call of the State Central Committee, and\r\nthe situation was thoroughly discussed. Among those participating\r\nwas Gov. Charles M. Croswell, who said that he believed that the\r\nparty should boldly declare for a sound currency, and resist with all\r\nits power the further spread of financial heresy; for himself, he\r\npreferred defeat on that platform to a victory won by any surrender\r\nto false theories. The endorsement of his views was substantially\r\nunanimous, and an aggressive campaign was determined upon. The State\r\nConvention was promptly called, and met in Detroit on June 13. It was\r\nthe ablest political gathering ever held in Michigan, and its delegates\r\nincluded the foremost men of the party from every county. Mr. Chandler\r\npresided; Governor Croswell was renominated at the head of a strong\r\nState ticket; a platform, admirable for its soundness of doctrine and\r\nclearness of statement[41] (its author was Frederick Morley, formerly\r\neditor of the Detroit _Post_), was adopted; and Mr. Chandler was, amid\r\nthe prolonged cheering of the convention, placed at the head of the\r\nState Committee. He had at that time about completed his plans for\r\na European journey, and it was suggested to him by friends that his\r\nchairmanship of the National Committee afforded a valid excuse for\r\ndeclining this new appointment, which would make him responsible for\r\nthe result of a doubtful fight, with the certainty that defeat would\r\ngreatly impair his political prestige. To this advice Mr. Chandler\r\nsimply replied, \"If Michigan Republicanism goes down, I will go\r\nwith it.\" He promptly canceled all other engagements, appointed his\r\nconfidential secretary, G. W. Partridge, secretary of the committee\r\n(with the consent of its members), and threw his energy and vigor into\r\nthat State campaign. The contest that followed under his leadership\r\npreserved the spirit of the convention and upheld the doctrines of the\r\nplatform. The financial question was discussed in every phase \"upon\r\nthe stump\" and by the press. Mr. Chandler himself spoke in all the\r\nleading cities of the State, and was seconded by many other orators,\r\nincluding James G. Blaine, James A. Garfield, and Stewart L. Woodford,\r\nwhose addresses were masterly examples of the candid, luminous and\r\npopular treatment of a topic usually regarded as too abstruse and dry\r\nfor profitable public discussion. The courage and honesty of this fight\r\nwere justly rewarded. The Republicans carried the State by over 47,000\r\nplurality, and elected every Congressional candidate and a Legislature\r\nwith a large Republican majority upon joint ballot. The victory was\r\na signal one. In no Western State had financial heresy ever been as\r\nresolutely grappled with and as thoroughly beaten, and his prominent\r\nshare in this battle must rank among Mr. Chandler's most unselfish and\r\nhonorable public services.\r\n\r\nAn unforeseen but almost poetically just result of this triumph was\r\nhis own return to Congress. Senator Christiancy's failing health\r\ncompelled him in the winter of 1879 to seek (under physician's\r\nadvice) rest and a change of climate. The President offered him the\r\nembassadorship at Berlin, or at Mexico, or at Lima, and he finally\r\ndecided to accept the latter. His nomination was sent to the Senate\r\non Jan. 29, 1879, and confirmed without reference to a committee. On\r\nFebruary 10, his resignation as Senator was laid before the Michigan\r\nLegislature, and on the 18th that body filled the vacancy by election.\r\nWith the earliest hints of the possibility of Senator Christiancy's\r\nretirement, Republican opinion and the popular expectation had agreed\r\nthat Mr. Chandler would be chosen for the remaining years of what the\r\nRepublicans of Michigan had unsuccessfully sought to make his fourth\r\nterm. This was regarded as due to him, as still more due to the party\r\nwhich had in 1875 been deprived of its choice, and as securing the\r\nrestoration to public activity of a man of national influence and\r\nprominence, at an hour when the sagacity of his political judgment\r\nhad been vindicated by the alarming attitude of the South, and when\r\nthe sturdiest qualities of leadership were needed in Washington. The\r\nlegislative action reflected this strong current of public sentiment.\r\nIn the Republican caucus (held in the new Capitol of that State),\r\nMr. Chandler was nominated for Senator on the first formal ballot,\r\nreceiving sixty-nine of the eighty-nine votes cast. In the Legislature\r\nhe was elected by the vote of every Republican in his seat in either\r\nbranch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MICHIGAN CAPITOL AT LANSING.]\r\n\r\nOn Feb. 22, 1879, Mr. Chandler's credentials were presented and\r\nread in the Senate, and he was escorted by Senator Ferry to the\r\nVice-President's desk, where the official oath was administered to\r\nhim by William A. Wheeler. He took the seat upon the outer row of\r\nthe Republican side, which he had occupied in other Congresses.\r\nThe circumstances of his return to public life attracted national\r\nattention, and his re-appearance in the Senate was everywhere accepted\r\nas significant of the growth of Republican courage and resolution.\r\nBut what followed outstripped all expectation and was dramatic in its\r\naccessories. Upon February 28, he first addressed the Forty-fifth\r\nSenate, speaking briefly upon a bill providing for pension arrears,\r\nand in advocacy of an amendment to make more efficient the methods of\r\ndetecting pension frauds by taking expert examiners from one part of\r\nthe country and sending them to another. In this connection he referred\r\nto his own experience as Secretary of the Interior, saying that he\r\nhad declared that with $100,000 to so use he could save $1,000,000 to\r\nthe Treasury yearly. Upon the same day, he also spoke briefly upon\r\nthe Sundry Civil Appropriation bill, opposing a proposition in it to\r\nre-open a settled claim of the war of 1812, based on expenditures\r\nmade by some of the older States for military purposes. He spoke from\r\nrecollection of a discussion in 1857, when this matter came up, and\r\nshowed that the principal of the claims had been already paid, and\r\nthat this was an attempt to collect compound interest. This measure,\r\nwhich Mr. Chandler repeatedly opposed during his Senatorial career, was\r\nagain defeated at this time. On March 1, a proposition to pay Georgia\r\nover $72,000 compound interest upon advances alleged to have been made\r\nin 1835-'38 in the Creek, Seminole and Cherokee wars was strenuously\r\nand successfully opposed by him. On the 28th of February, a bill had\r\nbeen passed by the Senate making appropriations for the arrearages\r\nof pensions. To this an amendment was offered and adopted extending\r\nto those who served in the war with Mexico the provisions of the law\r\npassed in 1878, giving pensions to the surviving soldiers of 1812. This\r\namendment was adopted without full consideration, and on the evening of\r\nSunday, March 2, a motion was made and carried for a reconsideration.\r\nThen an amendment was offered excluding persons who served in the\r\nConfederate army or held any office under the \"Confederacy\" from the\r\nbenefits of this bill. This amendment was defeated by the votes of the\r\nDemocrats and two Southern Republicans. Another amendment was offered\r\nby Senator Hoar excluding Jefferson Davis from the benefits of any\r\npension bill. An astonishing debate followed. For some hours the Senate\r\nChamber rang with fervent eulogies upon the arch-rebel of the South.\r\nSenator Garland declared that Davis's record would \"equal in history\r\nall Grecian fame and all Roman glory.\" Senator Maxey pronounced him\r\n\"a battle-scarred, knightly gentleman.\" Senator Lamar characterized\r\nthe proposition as a \"wanton insult,\" springing from \"hate, bitter,\r\nmalignant sectional feeling, and a sense of personal impunity;\" he\r\nadded, \"The only difference between myself and Jefferson Davis is that\r\nhis exalted character, his pre-eminent talents, his well-established\r\nreputation as a statesman, as a patriot, and as a soldier enabled\r\nhim to take the lead in a cause to which I consecrated myself;\" he\r\nfurther declared that Davis's motives were as \"sacred and noble as\r\never inspired the breast of a Hampden or a Washington.\" Senator Harris\r\npronounced him \"the peer of any Senator on this floor.\" \"I will not,\"\r\nsaid Senator Coke, \"vote to discriminate against Mr. Davis, for I was\r\njust as much a rebel as he.\" Senator Ransom said, \"I shall not dwell\r\nupon Mr. Davis's public services as an American soldier and statesman.\r\nHe belongs to history, as does that cause to which he gave all the\r\nability of his great nature.\" There was no lack of Republican protest\r\nagainst this apotheosis of unrepentant treason, but it was not wholly\r\nfree from a certain deprecatory tone. The Senators who spoke in support\r\nof Mr. Hoar's proposition rather remonstrated against than denounced\r\nthe assumption that it was their duty to quietly assent to legislation\r\nwhich would place the unamnestied and still defiant representative\r\nof the Great Rebellion on the pension-rolls of the nation. After\r\nthe debate had lasted for over two hours, Mr. W. E. Chandler of New\r\nHampshire, who was watching its progress from the reporters' gallery,\r\nsaid to Senator E. H. Rollins of his State, \"Tell Zach. Chandler that\r\nhe is the man to call Jeff. Davis a traitor.\" Mr. Rollins delivered the\r\nmessage, which was received with a nod of acquiescence in the direction\r\nof the gallery. Senator Morgan of Alabama was speaking at the time,\r\nwith Senator Mitchell of Oregon in the chair. As Mr. Morgan closed,\r\nSenator Chandler rose and said:\r\n\r\n  Mr. President, twenty-two years ago to-morrow, in the old Hall of\r\n  the Senate, now occupied by the Supreme Court of the United States,\r\n  I, in company with Mr. Jefferson Davis, stood up and swore before\r\n  Almighty God that I would support the Constitution of the United\r\n  States. Mr. Jefferson Davis came from the Cabinet of Franklin\r\n  Pierce into the Senate of the United States and took the oath with\r\n  me to be faithful to this government. During four years I sat in\r\n  this body with Mr. Jefferson Davis and saw the preparations going\r\n  on from day to-day for the overthrow of this government. With\r\n  treason in his heart and perjury upon his lips he took the oath to\r\n  sustain the government that he meant to overthrow.\r\n\r\n  Sir, there was method in that madness. He, in co-operation with\r\n  other men from his section and in the Cabinet of Mr. Buchanan, made\r\n  careful preparation for the event that was to follow. Your armies\r\n  were scattered all over this broad land where they could not be\r\n  used in an emergency; your fleets were scattered wherever the winds\r\n  blew and water was found to float them, where they could not be\r\n  used to put down rebellion; your Treasury was depleted until your\r\n  bonds bearing six per cent., principal and interest payable in\r\n  coin, were sold for 88 cents on the dollar for current expenses,\r\n  and no buyers. Preparations were carefully made. Your arms were\r\n  sold under an apparently innocent clause in an army bill providing\r\n  that the Secretary of War might, at his discretion, sell such arms\r\n  as he deemed it for the interest of the government to sell.\r\n\r\n  Sir, eighteen years ago last month I sat in these halls and\r\n  listened to Jefferson Davis delivering his farewell address,\r\n  informing us what our constitutional duties to this government\r\n  were, and then he left and entered into the rebellion to overthrow\r\n  the government that he had sworn to support! I remained here,\r\n  sir, during the whole of that terrible rebellion. I saw our brave\r\n  soldiers by thousands and hundreds of thousands, aye, I might say\r\n  millions, pass through to the theater of war, and I saw their\r\n  shattered ranks return; I saw steamboat after steamboat and\r\n  railroad train after railroad train arrive with the maimed and the\r\n  wounded; I was with my friend from Rhode Island (Mr. Burnside) when\r\n  he commanded the Army of the Potomac, and saw piles of legs and\r\n  arms that made humanity shudder; I saw the widow and the orphan in\r\n  their homes, and heard the weeping and wailing of those who had\r\n  lost their dearest and their best. Mr. President, I little thought\r\n  at that time that I should live to hear in the Senate of the United\r\n  States eulogies upon Jefferson Davis, living--a living rebel\r\n  eulogized on the floor of the Senate of the United States! Sir, I\r\n  am amazed to hear it; and I can tell the gentlemen on the other\r\n  side that they little know the spirit of the North when they come\r\n  here at this day, and, with bravado on their lips, utter eulogies\r\n  upon a man whom every man, woman, and child in the North believes\r\n  to have been a double-dyed traitor to his government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SENATOR CHANDLER DENOUNCING THE EULOGIES UPON \"JEFF.\"\r\nDAVIS.\r\n\r\n[In the Senate Chamber, at 3 A. M., Monday, March 3, 1879.]]\r\n\r\nThis speech was made at about the hour of half-past three in the\r\nmorning of Monday, March 3, 1879. But few people were in the galleries\r\nat that time, and the Senate had lapsed into a listless state. Mr.\r\nChandler's bearing as he arose to speak, and the first sentence that\r\nresounded through the Senate Chamber in his strong voice, aroused\r\ninstant attention. The spectators above listened with new and eager\r\ninterest, Senators came in from the lobbies and cloakrooms, sleep was\r\nshaken off by drowsy _attaches_, and his closing words \"a double-dyed\r\ntraitor to his government\" fell in ringing tones upon an intent\r\naudience and were answered by an applause from the galleries which\r\nthe gavel of the presiding officer could not check. His excited\r\nhearers listened eagerly for a reply, but none came. After some\r\nsilent waiting the presiding officer stated the pending question,\r\nand was about to put it to vote. Senator Thurman then rose and began\r\nthe discussion of another branch of the subject, and no answer was\r\nattempted to Mr. Chandler's just denunciation of the eulogizing of\r\nthe man, whose past history and present attitude unite to make him at\r\nonce the representative of treason's crimes and the embodiment of its\r\nunrepentant spirit. When the vote was taken, one majority was given\r\nfor Mr. Hoar's amendment, and after that result the original amendment\r\nitself was defeated.\r\n\r\nThis speech was a masterpiece in its way--in its brevity, in its\r\nskillful use of the speaker's early official association with Jefferson\r\nDavis, in its vivid epitome of the history of American treason, and in\r\nthe rugged power of its simple language. It most profoundly stirred\r\nthe people. It may be said without exaggeration that years had passed\r\nsince any Congressional utterance had received such public attention.\r\nDemocratic and Southern denunciation of Mr. Chandler followed\r\nabundantly, but this was wholly overshadowed by the enthusiasm of the\r\nresponse of the patriotic sentiment of the Union to his indignant\r\nrefusal to let treason raise its head in insolence without branding it\r\nas it deserved. The Northern press reprinted the speech with unstinted\r\npraise. Public men hastened in person, by telegraph, and through the\r\nmails to tender their congratulations. Letters of fervent thanks poured\r\nin by the hundreds; from utter strangers, from the rich and the humble,\r\nfrom veteran soldiers, from mothers whose sons were buried on Southern\r\nbattle-fields, from the colored men, from the Republicans of the South,\r\nfrom every State and Territory came the expressions of gratitude for\r\nthe utterance given at so opportune a moment and with such force to the\r\nloyal feeling of the republic. It was this spontaneous approval of the\r\nmasses of the people that Mr. Chandler especially prized.\r\n\r\nOn March 18, 1879, the extra session of the Forty-sixth Congress\r\ncommenced, and the Democrats made their abortive attempt to force the\r\nrepeal of the laws relating to the supervision of national elections by\r\nwithholding appropriations. Their reactionary programme (the striking\r\nof the last vestige of the war measures from the statute books was even\r\nthreatened) and revolutionary menaces aroused the North, and in the end\r\nthey quailed before the rising popular wrath. Mr. Chandler denounced\r\ntheir schemes vigorously on the floor of the Senate, even charging\r\nexplicitly that twelve of the Southern Senators \"held their seats by\r\nfraud and violence.\" He also earnestly opposed all propositions to\r\ncompel the unlimited coinage of the silver dollar of 412½ grains, a\r\nmeasure which would have given to the country a superabundance of\r\nsilver currency of depreciated value to the exclusion of gold. His\r\nlast Congressional speech was this carefully prepared and forcible\r\n\"arraignment of the Democratic party,\" of which tens of thousands of\r\ncopies were circulated throughout the Union in the following campaign:\r\n\r\n  We have now spent three months and a half in this Capitol, not\r\n  without certain results. We have shown to the people of this nation\r\n  just what the Democratic party means. The people have been informed\r\n  as to your objects, ends, and aims. By fraud and violence, by\r\n  shot-guns and tissue ballots, you hold a present majority in both\r\n  Houses of Congress, and you have taken an early opportunity to show\r\n  what you intend to do with that majority thus obtained. You are\r\n  within sight of the promised land, but like Moses of old we propose\r\n  to send you up into the mountain to die politically.\r\n\r\n  Mr. President, we are approaching the end of this extra session,\r\n  and its record will soon become history. The acts of the Democratic\r\n  party, as manifested in this Congress, justify me in arraigning\r\n  it before the loyal people of the United States on the political\r\n  issues which it has presented, _as the enemy of the nation_ and as\r\n  the author and abettor of rebellion.\r\n\r\n  1. I arraign the Democratic party for having resorted to\r\n  revolutionary measures to carry out its partisan projects, by\r\n  attempting to coerce the Executive by withholding supplies, and\r\n  thus accomplishing by starvation the destruction of the government\r\n  which they had failed to overthrow by arms.\r\n\r\n  2. I arraign them for having injured the business interests of\r\n  the country by forcing the present extra session, after liberal\r\n  compromises were tendered to them prior to the close of the last\r\n  session.\r\n\r\n  3. I arraign them for having attempted to throw away the results of\r\n  the recent war by again elevating State over National Sovereignty.\r\n  We expended $5,000,000,000 and sacrificed more than 300,000\r\n  precious lives to put down this heresy and to perpetuate the\r\n  _national life_. They surrendered this heresy at Appomattox, but\r\n  now they attempt to renew this pretension.\r\n\r\n  4. I arraign them for having attempted to damage the business\r\n  interests of the country by forcing silver coin into circulation,\r\n  of less value than it represents, thus swindling the laboring-man\r\n  and the producer, by compelling them to accept 85 cents for a\r\n  dollar, and thus enriching the bullion-owners at the expense of the\r\n  laborer. Four million dollars a day is paid for labor alone, and\r\n  by thus attempting to force an 85 cent dollar on the laboring-man\r\n  you swindle him daily out of $600,000. Twelve hundred million\r\n  dollars are paid yearly for labor alone, and by thus attempting to\r\n  force an 85-cent dollar on the laboring-man you swindle him out of\r\n  $180,000,000 a year. The amount which the producing class would\r\n  lose is absolutely incalculable.\r\n\r\n  5. I arraign them for having removed without cause experienced\r\n  officers and employes of this body, some of whom served and were\r\n  wounded in the Union army, and for appointing men who had in the\r\n  rebel army attempted to destroy this government.\r\n\r\n  6. I arraign them for having instituted a secret and illegitimate\r\n  tribunal, the edicts of which have been made the supreme governing\r\n  power of Congress in defiance of the fundamental principles of the\r\n  constitution. The decrees of this junta are known although its\r\n  motives are hidden.\r\n\r\n  7. I arraign them for having held up for public admiration that\r\n  arch-rebel, Jefferson Davis, declaring that he was inspired by\r\n  motives as sacred and as noble as animated Washington; and as\r\n  having rendered services in attempting to destroy the Union which\r\n  will equal in history Grecian fame and Roman glory. [Laughter on\r\n  the Democratic side and in portions of the galleries.] You can\r\n  laugh. The people of the North will make you laugh on the other\r\n  side of your faces!\r\n\r\n  8. I arraign them for having undertaken to blot from the\r\n  statute-book of the nation wise laws, rendered necessary by the war\r\n  and its results, and insuring \"life, liberty and the pursuit of\r\n  happiness\" to the emancipated freedmen, who are now so bulldozed\r\n  and ku-kluxed that they are seeking peace in exile, although urged\r\n  to remain by shot-guns.\r\n\r\n  9. I arraign them for having attempted to repeal the wise\r\n  legislation which excludes those who served under the rebel flag\r\n  from holding commissions in the army and navy of the United States.\r\n\r\n  10. I arraign them for having introduced a large amount of\r\n  legislation for the exclusive benefit of the States recently in\r\n  rebellion, which, if enacted, would bankrupt the national Treasury.\r\n\r\n  11. I arraign them for having conspired to destroy all that the\r\n  Republican party has accomplished. Many of them breaking their\r\n  oaths of allegiance to the United States and pledging their\r\n  lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honors to overthrow this\r\n  government, they failed, and thus lost all they pledged.\r\n\r\n  _Call a halt._ The days of vaporing are over. The loyal North is\r\n  aroused and their doom is sealed.\r\n\r\n  I accept the issue on these arraignments distinctly and\r\n  specifically before the citizens of this great republic. As a\r\n  Senator of the United States and as a citizen of the United States,\r\n  I appeal to the people. It is for those citizens to say who is\r\n  right and who is wrong. I go before that tribunal confident that\r\n  the Republican party is right and that the Democratic party is\r\n  wrong.\r\n\r\n  They have made these issues; not we; and by them they must stand or\r\n  fall. This is the platform which they have constructed, not only\r\n  for 1879 but for 1880. They cannot change it, for we will hold them\r\n  to it. They have made their bed, and we will see to it that they\r\n  lie thereon.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[41] The Michigan Republicans have done well. Their platform has about\r\nit the clear ring of honest conviction, undulled by any half-hearted\r\nand halting compromise. So lucid and courageous an enunciation of\r\nthe financial creed of the Republican party has certainly not been\r\nmade this year, nor has the irreconcilable hostility of the party to\r\nall forms of tampering with public credit and national honor been so\r\nresolutely and judiciously stated as by the Detroit Convention.--_New\r\nYork Times, June 14, 1878._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE CAMPAIGN OF 1879--MR. CHANDLER'S LAST DAYS--DEATH AND FUNERAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe closing hours of the Forty-fifth Congress and the extra session\r\nof the Forty-sixth may be said to have revealed Mr. Chandler to the\r\ncountry. While he had been well known he had not been truly known. He\r\nthen became a central figure in the public attention. His utterances\r\nwere universally discussed, and with discussion came a juster\r\nappreciation of the man. The people at last saw him as he was, the\r\npossessor of strong common-sense, a cool and indefatigable worker, a\r\nsagacious and fearless leader, a man who had never sacrificed principle\r\nto policy, who had never compromised with crimes against liberty or\r\nthe nation's honor, whose most malignant enemies had not accused\r\nhim of being influenced by corrupt motives, and one gifted with the\r\nrare capacity of saying the right thing at the right time in terse,\r\nimpromptu sentences, in epigrams which became political mottoes.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1879 followed closely upon the mid-summer adjournment\r\nof Congress, and invitations to address the people came to Mr. Chandler\r\nfrom a score of States. No public speaker was in more urgent demand, or\r\naroused a keener interest. The popular gatherings, which, during the\r\nsummer and fall, greeted his every appearance from the shores of the\r\nGreat Lakes to the Atlantic seaboard, amounted to a genuine ovation.\r\nHis first address was delivered before the Republican State Convention\r\nof Wisconsin, at Madison, on July 23. In August he made six speeches\r\nin Maine to immense mass meetings. In September he visited Ohio, and\r\nspoke at Sandusky, Toledo, Warren, Cleveland, and other important\r\npoints. His audiences in that State were uniformly large, and his\r\nWarren speech was delivered in the afternoon to an enormous crowd,\r\none of the greatest ever called together upon such an occasion in the\r\nWestern Reserve. He was greatly pleased by an invitation, which came to\r\nhim at about this time, from Senator G. F. Hoar, to visit Massachusetts\r\nin October. It was unexpected, and he had believed that the Republican\r\nleaders in the Bay State were inclined to look upon him with distrust.\r\nHe accepted it promptly, and spoke to enthusiastic audiences in Boston,\r\nWorcester, Lynn and Lowell. Some brief remarks made at a dinner of\r\nthe Middlesex Club, in which he urged the national importance of the\r\npending contest, were especially useful in stimulating Republican\r\nactivity and directing it into proper channels. He next addressed\r\nmeetings in New York at Flushing, Albany, Troy, Potsdam, Lowville\r\nand Buffalo, amid increasing public interest. On returning home from\r\nthat State in the last days of October, he revisited Wisconsin, and\r\nspoke to great crowds at Milwaukee, Oshkosh and Janesville, returning\r\nto Chicago, where, on the evening of October 31st, he made the last\r\naddress of his life.\r\n\r\nThe striking evidences of his hold upon the popular confidence, which\r\nmanifested themselves during the summer and fall of 1879, led to the\r\nfrequent mention of Mr. Chandler as a possible presidential candidate\r\nin 1880. His friends in his own State were eager to formally present\r\nhis name to the National Convention, and the Republican press of\r\nMichigan united in earnestly advocating such a course. This movement\r\nalso manifested strength in other States, and steadily increased in\r\nimportance up to the hour of his death. Although Mr. Chandler was not\r\ninsensible to this growing sentiment, little or nothing was done by\r\nhim to promote it; he favored the renomination of General Grant, and\r\nthe presidential ambition he rated as the most fatal malady to which\r\npublic men are subject.[42] To one friend, who spoke of the popular\r\nfeeling and his own desire in this matter, Mr. Chandler replied: \"You\r\nmay vaccinate me with the presidency and scratch it deep, but it won't\r\ntake.\" To another he said: \"No! no! Men recover from the small-pox,\r\ncholera and yellow fever, but never from the presidential fever. I\r\nhope I will never get it.\" The movement in that direction, which his\r\ndeath so abruptly checked, was spontaneous and sincere, and that it was\r\ngrowing in strength was undoubted. What limit that growth might have\r\nreached and with what result can only be conjectured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GRAND PACIFIC HOTEL AT CHICAGO.\r\n\r\n[Where Mr. Chandler died on the night of October 31, 1879.]]\r\n\r\nRepeatedly, during the arduous labors of the year, did Mr. Chandler's\r\nphysical powers manifest signs of rebellion against excessive effort.\r\nIn one of his Ohio speeches his voice suddenly failed, compelling\r\nhim to cease speaking. He suffered several times from what seemed to\r\nbe violent attacks of indigestion, and was on one or two occasions\r\ndangerously distressed by them. At Janesville he caught a severe cold,\r\nbut when he reached Chicago, on the last day of his life, he seemed to\r\nbe in his usual robust health, and showed but slight signs of fatigue.\r\nThose who called upon him on that day at the Grand Pacific Hotel noted\r\nhis fine spirits. His address in that city was delivered before the\r\nYoung Men's Auxiliary Republican Club in McCormick Hall, and he never\r\nspoke with more animation, nor more effectively. The audience applauded\r\nalmost every sentence, and under that stimulus he rose to even more\r\nthan his usual fervor of speech. His ringing sentence, \"The mission\r\nof the Republican party will not end until you and I, Mr. Chairman,\r\ncan start from the Canada border, travel to the Gulf of Mexico, make\r\nBlack Republican speeches wherever we please, vote the Black Republican\r\nticket wherever we gain a residence, and do it with exactly the same\r\nsafety that a rebel can travel throughout the North, stop wherever\r\nhe has a mind to, and run for judge in any city he chooses,\" was\r\nfollowed by cheer after cheer, until the entire audience was standing\r\nand shouting. After closing his speech, Mr. Chandler returned to the\r\nGrand Pacific Hotel; a few friends chatted with him in his rooms for\r\na short time, and at about midnight Representative Edwin Willits of\r\nMichigan, who had been one of his hearers, made a short call, and\r\ncongratulated him upon the power of his closing appeal. After that, no\r\nman saw Mr. Chandler alive. At seven o'clock on the following morning,\r\nin accordance with orders, one of the employes of the hotel knocked\r\nat his door. There was no answer, and a look over the transom showed\r\na figure lying in an unnatural attitude on the edge of the bed with\r\nthe feet almost touching the floor. In alarm the room was entered with\r\na pass-key, and Mr. Chandler was found in a half reclining posture,\r\nwith his coat about his shoulders, unconsciousness having apparently\r\nseized him while he was attempting to rise and summon help. Medical aid\r\nwas promptly at hand, but life was extinct. \"A Power had passed from\r\nearth.\" Zachariah Chandler was dead!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUST PROFILE OF ZACHARIAH CHANDLER.\r\n\r\n[A sketch from Leonard W. Volk's plaster cast.]]\r\n\r\nThe news spread at once throughout the great city in which he had so\r\nsuddenly fallen; friends were soon by his bedside, while a large crowd\r\ngathered about the hotel. A coroner's jury was at once impaneled,\r\nlistened to the testimony of the physicians, and returned a verdict\r\nthat death had resulted from cerebral hemorrhage. Impressions of the\r\nfeatures were taken by Leonard W. Volk, the eminent sculptor, and the\r\nlifeless body was then arranged by kind, if strange, hands for the\r\nfuneral casket. Before its removal to Detroit, thousands who cherished\r\nthe memory of the man looked mournfully upon the dead face.\r\n\r\nThe telegraph bore the intelligence of this sudden death promptly\r\nthroughout the country, and the announcement was answered by unusual\r\ndemonstrations of national grief. Throughout the cities and towns of\r\nMichigan, at Washington, and in many other places where his name was\r\nwell known, the insignia of mourning were at once displayed. Public\r\nmen sent prompt dispatches of sympathy to his family, upon whom the\r\nblow had fallen with prostrating force. Especially significant were the\r\nnewspaper tributes to the memory of the bold, resolute, and successful\r\nleader of men, whose star had not set, but had gone out at the zenith.\r\nThe President of the United States issued this official order:\r\n\r\n                            EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, Nov. 1, 1879.\r\n\r\n  The sad intelligence of the death of Zachariah Chandler, late\r\n  Secretary of the Interior, and during so many years Senator from\r\n  the State of Michigan, has been communicated to the government\r\n  and to the country, and, in proper respect to his memory, I\r\n  hereby order that the several executive departments be closed to\r\n  public business, and their flags, and those of their dependencies\r\n  throughout the country, be displayed at half-mast on the day of his\r\n  funeral.\r\n\r\n                                                            R. B. HAYES.\r\n\r\nFrom the Executive Mansion also came this dispatch of personal\r\ncondolence:\r\n\r\n                                WASHINGTON, D. C., Nov. 1, 1879.\r\n\r\n  _Mrs. Z. Chandler._\r\n\r\n  Mrs. Hayes joins me in the expression of the most heartfelt\r\n  sympathy with you in your great bereavement.\r\n\r\n                                                            R. B. HAYES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEN. U. S. GRANT'S TRIBUTE.\r\n\r\n[His endorsement on W. A. Gavett's official notification, as a member\r\nof the Detroit Commandery K. T. to attend Mr. Chandler's funeral.]]\r\n\r\nThe following proclamation was published by the Governor of Michigan:\r\n\r\n                        EXECUTIVE OFFICE, LANSING, Nov. 1, 1879.\r\n\r\n  _To the People of Michigan_:\r\n\r\n  An eminent citizen has suddenly been taken from us. Zachariah\r\n  Chandler was found dead in his room at the Grand Pacific Hotel in\r\n  Chicago early this morning. For nineteen years he has represented\r\n  this State in the National Senate. He held this exalted position\r\n  at the most perilous period in the history of the nation, and\r\n  unfalteringly supported every measure for the maintenance of the\r\n  Union. A member of the Cabinet under the recent administration\r\n  of President Grant, he proved himself a public officer of keen\r\n  sagacity, of incorruptible integrity and of admirable ability. A\r\n  resident of Michigan during the whole period of his manhood, he has\r\n  been active in advancing the interests of the State and promoting\r\n  its growth. By his energy he secured a competence, and by his\r\n  integrity the confidence of all. A statesman and a leader among\r\n  men, he combined in an unusual degree qualities which commanded\r\n  respect and admiration. Taken from us so unexpectedly, we cannot\r\n  but deeply feel and deplore his loss. I, therefore, as a tribute to\r\n  his memory and to his public services, hereby direct the several\r\n  State offices to be closed to public business, the flags to be\r\n  displayed at half-mast, and the other demonstrations of public\r\n  grief usual to be made, on the day of his funeral.\r\n\r\n                                                    CHARLES M. CROSWELL.\r\n\r\nAn unofficial tribute, highly prized by Mr. Chandler's friends, was\r\nthat of Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, who wrote upon the reverse of a funeral\r\norder issued by the Detroit Commandery of Knights Templar (shown him by\r\nW. A. Gavett) these lines:\r\n\r\n  A nation, as well as the state of Michigan, mourns the loss of one\r\n  of her most brave, patriotic and truest citizens. Senator Chandler\r\n  was beloved by his associates and respected by those who disagreed\r\n  with his political views. The more closely I became connected with\r\n  him the more I appreciated his great merits.\r\n\r\n                                                             U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n  GALENA, Ill., Nov. 9, 1879.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Sunday, November 2, an escort of the militia and of\r\nthe people of Chicago accompanied the body of the dead Senator from\r\nthe Grand Pacific Hotel to the depot, and delivered it to a committee\r\nof prominent citizens of Michigan, who had arrived to receive it. The\r\nburial-case was wrapped in the national flag, and, when it had been\r\nplaced in the car, its lid was opened and the face exposed. The train\r\nstopped at Niles, Kalamazoo, Marshall, Jackson, and Ann Arbor, and at\r\neach place crowds came on board to look at the remains. When Detroit\r\nwas reached, thousands of grief-stricken people were at the depot, and\r\nin solemn procession they joined the military escort in the march to\r\nthe Chandler mansion. There a few loving friends received and looked\r\nupon the silent and lifeless form. To gratify the earnest desire of the\r\nmany who wished to behold again the strong, earnest face of Zachariah\r\nChandler before it was forever covered from mortal sight, the body was\r\nremoved on the morning of November 5 to the City Hall, where it lay\r\nuntil one o'clock; a guard of honor kept watch at the head and foot of\r\nthe casket, and on either hand, for five hours, a double file of men\r\nand women passed in steady march. Thousands of mournful glances were\r\ngiven at the placid face of the dead, and many affecting incidents made\r\ntouching this parting tribute of the people. Then, from the City Hall,\r\nthe body was borne to the Fort street residence for the last time. The\r\nday was cold and blustering; a blinding snow-storm set in. Yet the\r\nstreets were thronged by the sad multitude, while every train brought\r\nfrom Michigan and from other States hundreds to increase the sorrowing\r\nconcourse; among them were men of great reputations founded on useful\r\nand honorable public careers. After impressive funeral services at the\r\nhouse, the remains of Michigan's great Senator, escorted by the militia\r\nof Detroit and of the neighboring cities, by the United States troops,\r\nby civic societies, by Governors, Senators, Congressmen, Legislators\r\nof Michigan and of other States, and by hundreds of friends, passed\r\nslowly through the streets draped in mourning, and lined with dense\r\ncrowds of people who braved the storm to pay this last honor to\r\nZachariah Chandler. At the gates of Elmwood Cemetery the militia and\r\ncivic societies halted, presenting arms as the hearse rolled slowly on\r\nunder its trees. Upon a high knoll, fronting on Prospect Avenue, it\r\nhalted; the coffin was drawn slowly out, poised a moment over an open\r\ngrave, lowered to its resting-place, and \"I am the resurrection and the\r\nlife\" rose up in solemn tones above the sobbings of family and friends.\r\nLiving green branches and flowers fell softly down upon the casket, and\r\na new mound grew up beside where Senator Chandler's brother already lay.\r\n\r\nThus was Zachariah Chandler buried. Living, he was honored. Dead, he\r\nwas mourned. Though dead, his labors and his example remain, and they\r\nform his fittest monument.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[42] This letter, written to a prominent Republican of the Pacific\r\ncoast, did not reach the gentleman to whom it was addressed until after\r\nMr. Chandler's death, and was then given to the public:\r\n\r\n                                   REPUBLICAN STATE CENTRAL COMMITTEE, }\r\n                                   DETROIT, Mich., Sept. 23, 1879.     }\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR: Your favor of 11th inst. is at hand, and contents noted.\r\n\r\nThe prospects for the success of the Republican party in the national\r\nelection next year look much more favorable now than they did the year\r\npreceding the election in 1876. Republicans are united, and earnestly\r\npreparing for success as the only hope of saving the country from the\r\nshot-gun rule of the Confederate Democracy. The Tammany bolt promises\r\nto give us New York both this year and next.\r\n\r\nOhio is sure to go Republican, and there is hardly a doubt that every\r\nNorthern State having a general election this fall will score a victory\r\nin favor of a free ballot and an honest count.\r\n\r\nEach Territory is entitled to two delegates in the National Republican\r\nConvention, under the rules heretofore adopted. I am under the\r\nimpression now that Grant's chances for the nomination are better than\r\nthose of any other person; but unless he is nominated without a contest\r\nhe will be out of the field, and there will be a trial of strength\r\nbetween the friends and supporters of a few stalwart radicals.\r\n\r\nNo unknown man of lukewarm sentiments or obscure antecedents will be\r\nnominated.\r\n\r\nIt is very possible that Michigan will present a name in the convention\r\nas well as Maine, New York, Ohio, and perhaps other States; but I know\r\nnothing special in regard to the matter, only that, if General Grant is\r\na candidate, no one else will be. Very truly, yours,\r\n\r\n                                                            Z. CHANDLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE LAST SPEECH\r\n\r\n                                  OF\r\n\r\n                          ZACHARIAH CHANDLER,\r\n\r\n      DELIVERED IN MCCORMICK HALL, IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO, ON THE\r\n                 NIGHT OF HIS DEATH, OCTOBER 31, 1879.\r\n\r\n   [Republished by permission of Ritchie & Williston, Stenographers,\r\n                   Room 23, Howland Block, Chicago.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. CHAIRMAN AND FELLOW-CITIZENS: It has become the custom of late to\r\nrestrict the lines of citizenship. In the Senate of the United States\r\nand in the halls of Congress you will hear citizenship described as\r\nconfined to States, and it is denied that there is such a thing as\r\nnational citizenship. I to-night address you, my fellow-citizens\r\nof Chicago, in a broad sense as fellow-citizens of the United\r\nStates of America. [Applause.] A great crime has been committed,\r\nmy fellow-citizens--a crime against this nation, a crime against\r\nrepublican institutions throughout the world; a crime against civil\r\nliberty, and the criminal is yet unpunished--that is to say, he is not\r\npunished according to his deserts. [Applause.] And I shall to-night\r\ndevote myself chiefly to the history of a crime, and shall endeavor to\r\nhold up the criminal to your execration. [Renewed applause.]\r\n\r\nBut, first, it is proper for me to allude to certain matters of\r\nnational importance, which are at this present moment living issues.\r\nTwelve years ago an idea was started in the neighboring State of Ohio,\r\ncalled the \"Ohio idea,\" which spread and bore fruit in different\r\nStates. That idea was to pay something with nothing. [Laughter] From\r\nthis Ohio idea sprang up a brood of other ideas. For example, the\r\ngreenback idea, an unlimited issue of irredeemable currency, and a\r\nparty was inaugurated in different States called the greenback party.\r\nIt took root in Michigan last year, had a vigorous growth, put forth\r\nlimbs, blossomed liberally, bore no fruit, and died. [Laughter and\r\ncheers.] Therefore, I shall pay no attention to the greenback party. It\r\nis not a living issue. [Laughter.] But the Ohio idea is still a living\r\nissue, and even during the last session of Congress a demand was made,\r\nand persistently made, to repeal the Resumption act that had been in\r\nexistence for years. The resumption of specie payment was virtually\r\naccomplished when, in 1874-5, that Resumption act became a law, for\r\nat that time we made that act so strong that there was no power on\r\nearth that could defeat the resumption of specie payments after it had\r\nonce been inaugurated. [Applause.] We authorized the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury to use any bonds ever issued by the government, and in any\r\namount that was necessary, to carry forward to success specie payments,\r\nas soon as the time arrived for the resumption. We carefully guarded\r\nthat law. True, we are under an obligation to the man who executed\r\nthe law, but the resumption of specie payments was as much a fixed\r\nfact when that law was signed as it is to-day, and all the powers on\r\nearth combined could not break that resumption when it had once been\r\ninaugurated.\r\n\r\nBut this Ohio idea, as I said, was to pay off your bonds with\r\ngreenbacks. Well, my fellow-citizens, we have paid off $160,000,000 of\r\nyour bonds in greenbacks within the last sixty or ninety days, and what\r\nmore do you want? Ah! But the Ohio idea was something different from\r\nthat. It was, as I said before, to pay something with nothing, and up\r\nto the final adjournment of the last regular session of Congress the\r\nattempt was still made to issue irredeemable paper and force it upon\r\nthe creditors of the nation. Now, if this paper which they propose\r\nto issue in paying off the bonds of your government was properly and\r\ntruthfully described, it would read thus: \"The government of the United\r\nStates for value received\"--for it was for value received; no greenback\r\nwas ever issued except for value received; no bond of the government\r\nwas ever issued except for value received--\"for value received, the\r\ngovernment of the United States promises to pay nothing to nobody,\r\nnever.\" [Applause and laughter.] That was the paper with which it was\r\nproposed by these men, entertaining then, and now entertaining the\r\n\"Ohio idea,\" to redeem the bonds of your government.\r\n\r\nNow, you have heard, I presume, here in Chicago, the denunciation of\r\nthe holders of your government bonds. The \"bloated bondholder\" was a\r\nterm of reproach, both on the floor of Congress and in the streets of\r\nChicago and all over these United States. But who were the bloated\r\nbondholders? Why, my friends, every single man who has a dollar in the\r\nsavings bank is a bloated bondholder, for there is not a savings-bank\r\nin the land, which ought to be entrusted with a dollar, whose funds\r\nare not invested in the bonds of your government. [Applause.] There\r\nis not a widow or orphan who has a fund to support the widow in her\r\nwidowhood and the orphan in its orphanage, in a trust company, who\r\nis not a bloated bondholder; for there is not a trust company in the\r\nland that ought to be trusted which has not a large proportion of its\r\nfunds in the bonds of your government. Every man who has his life\r\ninsured, or his house insured, or his barn, or his lumber, or who has\r\nany insurance, is a bloated bondholder; for there is not an insurance\r\ncompany, life, fire, marine, or of any other class of insurance, that\r\nought to be trusted, which has not its funds invested in bonds of\r\nyour government. You may go to the books of the Treasury to-morrow and\r\ninquire and you will find ninety-nine men who own $100 and less of the\r\nbonds of your government, directly or indirectly, where you will find\r\none man who owns $10,000 or more. And these men, entertaining the Ohio\r\nidea, would ruin the ninety-nine poor men for the possible chance of\r\ninjuring the one-hundredth rich man. And yet you may destroy the bonds\r\nof the rich man and you do him no harm, for he has but a small amount\r\nof his vast wealth in the bonds of your government, while the poor man,\r\nowning $100 or under as his little all, is utterly ruined. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nYou would not find a man, woman, or child in America who would touch\r\nthe kind of paper I have described, if proffered to them. You say you\r\nwould stop the interest on your bonded debt. Very well! The holder of\r\nyour bonds would say: \"You do not propose to pay any interest. I hold\r\na bond for value received, with a given amount of interest payable on\r\na given day. Now I will hold your bonds until you men entertaining\r\nthe Ohio idea are buried in your political graves, and then I will\r\nappeal to an honest people, to an honest government, to pay an honest\r\ndebt.\" [Applause] \"But,\" say these men, \"pay off your foreign bonds.\"\r\nI see men before me who remember the days of General Jackson, and they\r\nlikewise remember that in the time of General Jackson the government\r\nof France owed to the citizens of the United States $5,000,000, which\r\nFrance did not refuse to pay, but neglected to pay. It ran along\r\nfrom decade to decade, unpaid. General Jackson sent for the French\r\nminister and said: \"Unless that $5,000,000 due to the citizens of the\r\nUnited States is paid, I will declare war against France.\" [Applause.]\r\nGeneral Jackson was remonstrated with. It would disturb the commercial\r\nrelations, not only of this country, but the world. Said he, \"Unless\r\nFrance pays that $5,000,000, by the Eternal, I will declare war against\r\nFrance.\" [Applause.] Every man, woman and child and the King of France\r\nknew that he would do it, and the $5,000,000 was paid to the United\r\nStates. It is not $5,000,000 that your government owes to the citizens\r\nof the world, but it is more than fifty times five million, and it is\r\nscattered in every nation with which we have commercial relations, or\r\nwhere money is found to invest in your bonds. You say you will stop\r\nthe interest on those bonds. How long do you think it would be before\r\na British fleet would come sailing to your coast, followed by a French\r\nfleet, and a German fleet, and a Russian, and an Austrian, and a\r\nSpanish and an Italian fleet, and the British Admiral would step ashore\r\nand say: \"I have $50,000,000 of the bonds of this government belonging\r\nto the citizens of Great Britain, which I am ordered to collect!\" The\r\nanswer is: \"Your account is correct, sir. The government of the United\r\nStates owes just $50,000,000 to the citizens of Great Britain, and here\r\nis your money, sir.\"\r\n\r\n[Mr. Chandler, suiting the action to the word, held out a sheet of\r\npaper with $50,000,000 written upon it, and the audience burst out into\r\nloud and long-continued laughter.]\r\n\r\nThe British Admiral looks at it and says: \"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, money. Don't you see? Why, it is a first mortgage on all the\r\nproperty of all the citizens of all the United States.\" [Laughter.]\r\n\"Don't you see the stamp of the government?\" [Laughter.]\r\n\r\nSays the Admiral: \"Where is it payable?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nowhere.\" [Laughter and applause.]\r\n\r\n\"To whom is it payable?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody.\" [Laughter.]\r\n\r\n\"When is it made payable?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never.\" [Renewed laughter and cheers.]\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" says the Admiral, \"I don't know any such money. My orders are\r\nto collect this $50,000,000 in the coin of the world, and unless it is\r\nso paid my orders are to blockade every port of these United States,\r\nand here are all the navies of the earth to assist me, and to burn down\r\nevery city that my guns will reach.\"\r\n\r\nHonesty is the best policy with nations as well as with individuals.\r\n[Cheers.] \"Well,\" they say, \"perhaps you are right about this bond\r\nbusiness. It is an open question, and we will abandon that, but the\r\nnational banks--down with the national banks! [Laughter and applause.]\r\nAbolish national banks and save interest.\" What do you want to abolish\r\nthe national banks for? That is a living issue to-day--a present\r\nproposition of the Democratic party that I propose to hold up to your\r\nabhorrence before I get through to-night. What do you want to \"down\r\nwith the national banks\" for? I was in the Senate of the United States\r\nwhen that national banking law was passed. I was a member of that\r\nbody and voted upon every proposition made in it. I had had a little\r\nexperience in state banks myself. [Laughter and applause.] Michigan had\r\na very large state bank circulation at one time [loud applause], and\r\nwe called that \"money\" in those days wild-cat money [laughter], and\r\nit was very wild. [Renewed laughter and applause.] Chicago also had\r\na little experience in those days as well as Michigan. In those days\r\nit was necessary for any man liable to receive a five-dollar note to\r\ncarry a counterfeit detector with him for three purposes. First, to\r\nascertain whether there ever was such a bank in existence. [Laughter\r\nand applause.] Second, to ascertain whether the bill was counterfeit,\r\nand, third, to ascertain whether the bank had failed [laughter]--and as\r\na rule it had failed. [Laughter and applause.] Now, we had two objects\r\nin view in getting up that national banking law. First, we wanted to\r\nfurnish an absolutely safe circulating medium, so that no loss could\r\nensue to the bill-holder. Second, we wanted to furnish a market for\r\nour bonds which had become somewhat of a drug. We might just as well\r\nhave put in state bonds as security for those bank notes. It would have\r\nbeen just as legal, just as right, but we didn't know which one or how\r\nmany of those rebel States would repudiate their bonds, and therefore\r\nwe didn't put in any. [Laughter and applause.] We might just as well\r\nhave put in railroad bonds, but we didn't know how many railroads\r\nwould default in their interest. We might just as well have put in real\r\nestate, but we didn't know whether the neighbors of the banker would\r\nappraise the real estate at its actual cash-selling value. [Applause\r\nand laughter.] And therefore we put in the bonds of your government at\r\n90 cents on the dollar; so that to-day for every single 90 cents of\r\nnational bank notes afloat there is 100 cents--(worth 102½ cents)--of\r\nthe bonds of your government deposited with the Treasurer of the United\r\nStates for the redemption of the 90 cents. [Applause.] And you don't\r\nknow and you don't care whether the bank is located in Oregon, in\r\nTexas, in South Carolina, Mississippi, New York or Illinois, because\r\nyou know there is 102½ cents to-day of the bonds of your government\r\ndeposited with the Treasurer of the United States for the redemption of\r\nevery 90 cents of national bank notes you hold. You don't know and you\r\ndon't care whether the bank whose note you have in your pocket failed\r\nyesterday, last week, or last year, or whether it ever failed. And you\r\nnever find that out, for if trouble comes the bonds are sold and your\r\nbank notes are redeemed the day after, or the week after, or the year\r\nafter your bank has failed, precisely the same as though it had never\r\nfailed. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nNow you say, \"Call in your bonds; abolish the national bank notes.\"\r\nVery well! You pass a law to-morrow repealing the charters of all your\r\nnational banks. Call in the national bank notes! Every national bank in\r\nAmerica takes the exact amount of the circulation which it has, either\r\nin silver or gold or greenbacks, to the Treasury, leaves it there\r\nto redeem its notes, takes the bonds and distributes them among the\r\nstockholders of that bank, and the day after you have called in every\r\nnational bank note that you have out, you pay the self-same amount of\r\ninterest on your bonds that you paid the day before, not one farthing\r\nmore nor less. You don't gain one cent, but you lose $16,500,000 of\r\ntaxes paid this year and last year and every year upon the stock of\r\nthe national banks to national, state and municipal governments.\r\n[Applause.] You gain nothing, and you lose $16,500,000. You distress\r\nthe whole community of these United States by compelling your banks\r\nto call in $850,000,000, now loaned and now being used in commerce,\r\nmanufactures and all the industries of the nation. You distress the\r\npeople by forcing a recall of that amount. No, my friends, in my\r\njudgment you had better devote yourselves to something you understand,\r\nand let the national banks alone. [Applause and laughter.]\r\n\r\nBut they say, \"There is one thing that we know we are right on, and\r\nthat is the free coinage of silver.\" Every man who holds 85 cents worth\r\nof silver shall go to the Treasury or the mints of the United States\r\nand take a certificate of deposit for 100 cents, which shall pass as\r\nmoney. This was the Warner bill. This the Democratic party as a party\r\nwas committed to, and is committed to, and on the very last day of the\r\nextra session by a majority vote of one, and only one, in the Senate of\r\nthe United States we substantially laid that bill upon the table, every\r\nRepublican voting aye, and every Democrat, except four or five, voting\r\nno. [Applause.] Now, to-day, the laboring man can take gold or silver\r\nor paper, as he chooses, for his day's labor. I am in favor of the\r\ndual standard. I am in favor of a silver dollar with 100 cents in it.\r\nI am in favor of an honest dollar anywhere you can find it [cheers],\r\nand I stand by an honest dollar. To-day the laboring man can take gold\r\nor silver or paper, and they are all of equal value, because they are\r\nall interchangeable into each other. The paper dollar costs nothing; a\r\nsilver dollar costs the government 85 cents--a fraction more now; it\r\nhas been a fraction less. But all three are of equal value. Now the\r\nvery moment you commence issuing those certificates of deposit freely\r\nto every man having bullion you banish gold from your circulating\r\nmedium and make it an article of traffic and nothing else; and you have\r\nbut a single standard, and that is a depreciated standard. Now there is\r\npaid out in these United States every day for labor alone $4,000,000.\r\nBy compelling the substitution of the silver dollar alone, you swindle\r\nthe laboring man out of $600,000 a day. The laboring man who receives\r\na dollar gets but 85 cents. The man who receives $10 a week gets\r\n$8.50, and no more. The farmer who sells a horse, or the man who sells\r\na load of lumber, or a load of wheat, or anything else amounting\r\nto $100, receives but $85, and no more. You have but one single\r\nstandard, and that the silver standard, which, having banished gold,\r\nis worth precisely the metal that is in it. Who is benefited by this\r\nsubstitution? Why, my friends, not a living mortal is benefited, except\r\nthe bullion-owner and the bullion-speculator. I do not charge these\r\nmen with being bribed to pass that law, because I have no proof of it;\r\nbut I do say that the bullion-owners and the bullion-speculators can\r\nafford to pay $10,000,000 in bullion for the privilege of swindling the\r\nlaboring men of the country out of 15 per cent. of all their earnings.\r\n[Applause.] They say, \"That may all be true; we don't know how it is;\r\nwe have not been bribed\"--and I never knew a man that would own up that\r\nhe was bribed in my life. [Laughter.] I don't say that they are, but I\r\ndo say that they are engaged in a mighty mean business. [Laughter and\r\napplause.]\r\n\r\nBut there is another question which is of vital interest to every\r\nman, woman and child in America, and that is this question of the\r\nenormous rebel claims against your government. I hold in my hand a\r\nlist of the claims now before the two houses of Congress, and being\r\npressed--cotton claims, claims for the destruction of property, for\r\nquartermaster's stores, for every conceivable thing that war could\r\nproduce. I have a list of claims right here [holding up several sheets\r\nof paper containing names and amounts] aggregating many hundreds of\r\nmillions. And the only thing to-day--the Senate and the House both\r\nbeing under the control of those Southern rebels--the only protection,\r\nthe only barrier between the Treasury of the United States and those\r\nrebel claims is a presidential veto [cheers], and thank God for the\r\nveto! [Long-continued applause.] But these claims are not all. There\r\nare claims innumerable which they dare not yet present. You may go\r\nthrough every State in the South, and somewhere, hidden away, you will\r\nfind a claim for every slave that ever was liberated. In the files of\r\nthe Senate and the House you will find demands for untold millions of\r\ndollars to improve streams that do not exist--where you will have to\r\npump the water to get up a stream at all. [Laughter and applause.]\r\nDemands for untold millions to build the levees of the Mississippi\r\nriver! We have already given the Southern people 32,000,000 of acres of\r\nland which would be reclaimed by those levees, and now they propose to\r\nbankrupt your Treasury by telling you, people of the North, to build\r\nthe levees to make the lands which you gave them valuable.\r\n\r\nTo show you that I am not over-stating this idea of Southern claims, I\r\nwill read you a petition which is now being circulated throughout the\r\nSouth:\r\n\r\n\"We, the people of the United States, most respectfully petition your\r\nhonorable bodies to enact a law by which all citizens of every section\r\nof the United States may be paid for all their property destroyed by\r\nthe governments and armies on both sides, during the late war between\r\nthe States, in bonds, bearing 3 per cent. interest per annum, maturing\r\nwithin the next one hundred years.\"\r\n\r\nEvery soldier who served in the Northern army has been paid. Every\r\ndollar's worth of property furnished to the Northern army has been paid\r\nfor. Every widow or orphan of a wounded soldier entitled to a pension\r\nhas been pensioned, so that there is no claim from the North; but this\r\nmeans that you shall do for the South precisely what you have done for\r\nyour own soldiers.\r\n\r\nBut I have not yet reached the milk in this cocoa-nut. [Laughter.]\r\n\r\n\"And we also petition that all soldiers, or their legal\r\nrepresentatives, of both armies and every section, be paid in bonds\r\nor public lands for their lost time [laughter], limbs, and lives\r\nwhile engaged in the late unfortunate civil conflict.\" [Laughter and\r\napplause.]\r\n\r\nThat all soldiers be paid for their lost time while fighting to\r\noverthrow your government! That they shall be paid for their lost limbs\r\nand their lost lives while fighting to overthrow your government!\r\n\r\nAh, my fellow-citizens, they are in sober, serious, downright earnest.\r\nThey have captured both houses of Congress, and the only obstacle to\r\nthe payment of these infamous claims is the presidential veto, and\r\nthere is not a man before me who has not a personal, direct interest in\r\nseeing to it that the rebels do not capture the balance of Washington.\r\n[Applause.] These rebel States are solid--solid for repudiating your\r\ndebt, solid for paying these rebel claims; they have repudiated their\r\nindividual debts through the bankrupt law; they have repudiated their\r\nState debts by scaling, and then refusing to pay the interest on\r\nwhat has been scaled; they have repudiated their municipal debts by\r\nrepealing the charters of their cities, towns, and villages. And do\r\nyou think they are more anxious to pay the debt contracted for their\r\nsubjugation than they are to pay their own honest debts? I tell you,\r\nNo. They mean repudiation, and do not mean that your debt shall be of\r\nany more value than their own. When you trust them you are making a\r\nmistake, and I do not believe you will ever do it again. [Laughter and\r\napplause, and voices: \"We won't!\"]\r\n\r\nBut we have a matter under consideration to-night of vastly more\r\nimportance than all the financial questions that can be presented to\r\nyou, and that is, Is this or is it not a Nation! We had supposed for\r\ngenerations that this was a Nation. Our fathers met in convention\r\nto frame a constitution, and they found some difficulty in agreeing\r\nupon the details of that constitution, and for a time it was a\r\nmatter of extreme doubt whether any agreement could be reached.\r\nAcrimonious debate took place in that convention, but finally a spirit\r\nof compromise prevailed, and the constitution was adopted by the\r\nconvention and submitted to the people of these United States. Not to\r\nthe States, but to the people of the United States, and the people\r\nof the United States adopted the constitution that was framed by the\r\nfathers, and for many long years the whole people of the United States\r\nbelieved that we had a Government. The whisky rebellion broke out in\r\nPennsylvania, and was put down by the strong arm of the Government,\r\nand we still believed that we had a Government. We continued in that\r\nbelief until the days of General Jackson, when South Carolina raised\r\nthe flag of rebellion against the Government. Armed men trod the soil\r\nof South Carolina and threatened that unless the tariff was modified to\r\nsuit their views they would overthrow the Government. This was under\r\nthe leadership of John C. Calhoun, in carrying out his doctrine. Old\r\nGeneral Jackson took his pipe out of his mouth when he was told that\r\nCalhoun was in rebellion against the Government, and said: \"Let South\r\nCarolina commit the first act of treason against this Government, and,\r\nby the Eternal, I will hang John C. Calhoun!\" and every man, woman, and\r\nchild in America, including Calhoun, knew that he would do it, and the\r\nfirst act of treason was not committed against the Government, for even\r\nthe State of South Carolina, under the leadership of John C. Calhoun,\r\nhad bowed to its power.\r\n\r\nWe remained under that impression until I first took my seat in\r\nthe Senate on the 4th day of March, 1857. Then, again, treason was\r\nthreatened on the floor of the Senate and on the floor of the House.\r\nThey said then: \"Do this or we will destroy your Government. Fail\r\nto do that, and we will destroy your Government.\" One of them in\r\ntalking to brave old Ben. Wade one day repeated this threat, and\r\nthe old man straightened himself up and said: \"Don't delay it on my\r\naccount.\" [Laughter.] Careful preparations were made to carry out\r\nthese treasons. Jefferson Davis stepped out of the Cabinet of Franklin\r\nPierce, as Secretary of War, into the Senate of the United States, and\r\nbecame chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs. There was an\r\ninnocent-looking clause in the general appropriation bill which read\r\nthat the Secretary of War might sell such arms as he deemed it for\r\nthe interest of the government to dispose of. Under that apparently\r\ninnocent clause, your arsenals were opened; your arms and implements\r\nof war went together with your ammunition; your accoutrements followed\r\nyour arms; your navy was scattered wherever the winds blew and\r\nsufficient water was found to float your ships, where they could not\r\nbe used to defend your government. The credit of the government, whose\r\n6 per cent. bonds in 1857 sold for 122 cents on the dollar, was so\r\nutterly prostrated and debased that in February, 1861--four years\r\nafterward--bonds payable, principal and interest in gold, bearing 6\r\nper cent., were sold for 88 cents on the dollar, with no buyers for\r\nthe whole amount. Careful preparations were made for the overthrow\r\nof your government, and when Abraham Lincoln [cheers] took the oath\r\nof office as President of the United States [cheers], you had no\r\narmy, no navy, no money, no credit, no arms, no ammunition, nothing\r\nto protect the national life. Yet with all these discouragements\r\nstaring us in the face, the Republican party undertook to save your\r\ngovernment. [Applause.] We raised your credit, created navies, raised\r\narmies, fought battles, carried on the war to a successful issue, and,\r\nfinally, when the rebellion surrendered at Appomattox, they surrendered\r\nto a Government. [Applause.] They admitted that they had submitted\r\ntheir heresy to the arbitrament of arms and had been defeated, and\r\nthey surrendered to the government of the United States of America.\r\n[Applause.] They made no claims against this government, for they had\r\nnone. In the very ordinance of secession which they had signed they\r\nhad pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to the\r\noverthrow of this government, and when they failed to do it, they lost\r\nall they had pledged. [Cries of \"Good.\"] They made no claims against\r\nthe government because they had none. They asked, and asked as a boon\r\nfrom the government of the United States, that their miserable lives\r\nmight be spared to them. [Applause.] We gave them their lives. They had\r\nforfeited all their property--we gave it back to them. We found them\r\nnaked and we clothed them. They were without the rights of citizenship,\r\nhaving forfeited those rights, and we restored them. We took them to\r\nour bosoms as brethren, believing that they had repented of their sins.\r\nWe killed for them the fatted calf, and invited them to the feast, and\r\nthey gravely informed us that they had always owned that animal, and\r\nwere not thankful for the invitation. [Great laughter and cheers.] By\r\nthe laws of war, and by the laws of nations, they were bound to pay\r\nevery dollar of the expense incurred in putting down that rebellion.\r\nGermany compelled France to pay $1,000,000,000 in gold coin for a brief\r\ncampaign. The seceding States were bound by the laws of war and by the\r\nlaws of nations to pay every dollar of the debt contracted for their\r\nsubjugation, but we forgave them that debt, and, to-day, you are being\r\ntaxed heavily to pay the interest on the debt that they ought to have\r\npaid. [Applause.] Such magnanimity as was exhibited by this nation to\r\nthese rebels has never been witnessed on earth [applause], and, in my\r\nhumble judgment, will never be witnessed again. [Cheers.] Mistakes we\r\nundoubtedly made, errors we committed, and I will take my full share of\r\nresponsibility for the errors, for I was there, and voted upon every\r\nproposition; but, in my humble judgment, the greatest mistake we made,\r\nand the gravest error we committed was in not hanging enough of these\r\nrebels to make treason forever odious. [Prolonged cheers.] Somebody\r\ncommitted a crime. Either those men who rose in rebellion committed\r\nthe greatest crime known to human law, or our own brave soldiers, who\r\nwent out to fight to save this government, were murderers. Is there a\r\nman on the face of the earth who dares to get up and say that our brave\r\nsoldiers, who bared their breasts to the bullets of the rebels, were\r\nanything but patriots? [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nAnd now, after twenty years--after an absence of four years from the\r\nSenate--I go back and take my seat, and what do I find? The self same\r\npretensions are rung in my ears from day to-day. I might close my eyes\r\nand leave my ears open to the discussions that are going on daily\r\nin Congress, and believe that I had taken a Rip Van Winkle sleep of\r\ntwenty years. [Applause.] Twenty years ago they said, \"Do this or we\r\nwill shoot your government to death! Fail to do that or we will shoot\r\nyour government to death!\" To-day I go back and find these paroled\r\nrebels, who have never been relieved from their parole of honor to\r\nobey the laws, saying: \"Do this! obey our will, or we will starve your\r\ngovernment to death! Fail to obey our will, and we will starve your\r\ngovernment to death!\" Now, if I am to die, I would rather be shot dead\r\nwith musketry than be starved to death. [Laughter and applause.]\r\n\r\nThese rebels--for they are just as rebellious now as they were twenty\r\nyears ago--there is not a particle of difference--these rebels to-day\r\nhave thirty-six members on the floor of the House of Representatives,\r\nwithout one single constituent, and in violation of law those\r\nthirty-six members represent 4,000,000 people, lately slaves, who are\r\nas absolutely disfranchised as if they lived in another sphere, through\r\nshot-guns, and whips, and tissue ballots; for the law expressly says,\r\nwherever a race or class is disfranchised they shall not be represented\r\nupon the floor of the House. [Applause.] And these thirty-six members\r\nthus elected constitute three times the whole of their majority upon\r\nthe floor of the House. Now, my fellow-citizens, this is not only\r\na violation of law, but it is an outrage upon all the loyal men of\r\nthese United States. [Applause.] It ought not to be. It must not be.\r\n[Applause.] And it shall not be. [Tremendous cheers.]\r\n\r\nTwelve members of the Senate--and that is more than their whole\r\nmajority--twelve members of the Senate occupy their seats upon that\r\nfloor by fraud and violence, and I am saying no more to you in Chicago\r\nthan I said to those rebel generals to their faces on the floor of the\r\nSenate of the United States. [Enthusiastic applause.] Twelve members\r\nof that Senate were thus elected, and with majorities thus obtained\r\nby fraud and violence in both houses, they dare to dictate terms to\r\nthe loyal men of these United States. [Applause.] With majorities thus\r\nobtained they dare to arraign the loyal men of this country, and say\r\nthey want honest elections. [Laughter and applause.] They are mortally\r\nafraid of bayonets at the polls. We offered them a law forbidding any\r\nman to come within two miles of a polling place with arms of any\r\ndescription, and they promptly voted it down [laughter and applause],\r\nfor they wanted their Ku-Klux there. They were afraid, not of Ku-Klux\r\nat the polls, but of soldiers at the polls. Now, in all the States\r\nnorth of Mason and Dixon's line and east of the Rocky Mountains there\r\nis less than one soldier to a county. [Laughter.] There is about\r\ntwo-thirds of a soldier to a county. [Laughter and applause.] And, of\r\ncourse, about two-thirds of a musket to a county. [Laughter.] Now,\r\nwould not this great county of Cook tremble if you saw two-thirds of a\r\nsoldier parading himself up and down in front of the city of Chicago.\r\n[Loud and long-continued applause and laughter.] But they are afraid to\r\nhave inspectors. What are they afraid to have inspectors for? The law\r\ncreating those inspectors is imperative that one must be a Democrat and\r\nthe other a Republican. They have no power whatever except to certify\r\nthat the election is honest and fair. And yet they are afraid of those\r\ninspectors, and then they are afraid of marshals at the polls. Now,\r\nwhile the inspectors cannot arrest, the marshals under the order of\r\nthe court can arrest criminals; therefore, they said: \"We will have\r\nno marshals.\" What they want is not free elections, but free frauds\r\nat elections. They have got a solid South by fraud and violence. Give\r\nthem permission to perpetrate the same kind of fraud and violence in\r\nNew York city and in Cincinnati and those two cities with a solid South\r\nwill give them the presidency of the United States; and once obtained\r\nby fraud and violence, by fraud and violence they would hold it for\r\na generation. To-day eight millions of people in those rebel States\r\nas absolutely control all the legislation of this government as they\r\ncontrolled their slaves while slavery was in existence. Through caucus\r\ndictation now I find precisely what I found twenty years ago when I\r\nfirst took my seat in Congress. In a Democratic Congress, composed of\r\ntwenty-eight Southern Democrats and sixteen Northern Democrats, they\r\ndecreed that Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois should be degraded and\r\ndisgraced from the Committee on Territories, and there were but just\r\ntwo Northern Democratic senators who dared even to enter a protest\r\nagainst the outrage. To-day there are thirty-two Southern Democratic\r\nsenators to twelve Northern, and out of the whole twelve there is not\r\na man who dares protest against anything. [Applause.] I say, that\r\nthrough this caucus dictation, these eight millions of Southern rebels\r\nas absolutely control the legislation of this nation as they controlled\r\ntheir slaves when slavery existed.\r\n\r\nNow, if every man within the sound of my voice should stand up in this\r\naudience and hold up his right hand and swear that a rebel soldier was\r\nbetter than a Union soldier, I would not believe it. [Laughter and\r\napplause.] I would hold up both of my hands and swear that I did not\r\nbelieve it. [Cheers.] And yet, to-day, in South Carolina, in Alabama,\r\nin Louisiana, in Mississippi and in several other States the vote of a\r\nrebel soldier counts more than two of the votes of the brave soldiers\r\nof Illinois; for they vote for the negro as well as for themselves, and\r\ntheir vote weighs just double the weight of that of the brave soldier\r\nin Illinois. It is an outrage upon freedom, an outrage upon the gallant\r\nsoldiers of Illinois and Michigan. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nNow, my fellow-citizens, I have undertaken to show you the condition\r\nin which the country was placed when the Republican party assumed the\r\nreins of power. When the Republican party took the reins of power, the\r\ncountry had no money, no credit, no arms, no ammunition, no navy, no\r\nmaterial of war. When the Republican party took the reins of power in\r\nits hands, there was no nation poor enough to do you reverence. You\r\nwere the derision of the nations of the earth. You had but one ally\r\nand friend on earth, and that was little Switzerland. [Applause.]\r\nRussia sent her fleet to winter here for her own protection, but there\r\nwas not a nation on God's earth, that did not hope and pray that your\r\nrepublican government might be overthrown, and there was no nation on\r\nearth poor enough to do you reverence. We fought that battle through;\r\nwe raised the nation's dignity, and the nation's honor, the national\r\npower and the national strength, until now, to-day, after eighteen\r\nyears of Republican rule, there is no nation on earth strong enough\r\nnot to do you reverence. [Loud and continued applause.] We took your\r\nnational credit when it was so low that your bonds were selling at 88\r\ncents on the dollar, bearing six per cent. interest and no takers,\r\nand we elevated your credit up, up, up, up, up until to-day your\r\nfour per cent. bonds are selling at a premium in every market of the\r\nearth. [Applause.] So your credit stands higher than the credit of any\r\nother nation. [Applause.] We saved the national life and we saved the\r\nnational honor, and yet, notwithstanding all this, there are those\r\nwho say that the mission of the Republican party is ended and that it\r\nought to die. If there ever was a political organization that existed\r\non the face of this globe, which, so far as a future state of rewards\r\nand punishments is concerned, is prepared to die, it is that old\r\nRepublican party. [Cheers.] But we are not going to do it. [Laughter\r\nand applause.] We have made other arrangements. [Renewed laughter and\r\ncheers.]\r\n\r\nThe Republican party is the only party that ever existed, so far as\r\nI have been able to ascertain--so far as any record can be found,\r\neither in sacred or profane history--it is the only party that ever\r\nexisted on earth which had not one single, solitary, unfulfilled\r\npledge left [cheers]--not one [renewed cheers]; and I defy the worst\r\nenemy the Republican party ever had to name one single pledge it gave\r\nto the people who created it which is not to-day a fulfilled and an\r\nestablished fact. [Cheers.] The Republican party was created with one\r\nidea, and that was to preserve our vast territories from the blighting\r\ncurse of slavery. We gave that pledge at our birth, that we would save\r\nthose territories from the withering grasp of slavery, and we saved\r\nthem. [Voices. \"Yes, we did.\"] It is our own work. We did it. [Cheers.]\r\nBut we did more than that; we not only saved your vast territories\r\nfrom the blighting curse of slavery, but we wiped the accursed thing\r\nfrom the continent of North America. [Tremendous cheering.] We pledged\r\nourselves to save your national life, and we saved your national\r\nlife. We pledged ourselves to save your national honor, and we saved\r\nyour national honor. [Applause.] We pledged ourselves to give you a\r\nhomestead law, and we gave you a homestead law. [Applause.] We pledged\r\nourselves to improve your rivers and your harbors, and we improved your\r\nrivers and your harbors. [Applause.] We pledged ourselves to build\r\na Pacific railroad, and we built a Pacific railroad. [Applause.] We\r\npledged ourselves to give you a college land bill, and we gave it to\r\nyou; and, not to weary you, the last pledge ever given and the last to\r\nbe fulfilled was that the very moment we were able we would redeem the\r\nobligations of this great government in the coin of the realm, and on\r\nthe first day of January, 1879, we fulfilled the last pledge ever given\r\nby the Republican party. [Cheers and long-continued applause.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, you say: \"Your mission is ended and you\r\nought to die.\" [Laughter and applause.] Well, my fellow-citizens, if\r\nwe should die to-day, or to-morrow, our children's children to the\r\ntwentieth generation would boast that their ancestors belonged to that\r\nglorious old Republican party [applause] that wiped that accursed\r\nthing, slavery, from the escutcheon of this great government. [Cheers.]\r\nAnd they would have a right to boast throughout all generations.\r\n\r\nSenator Ben. Hill of Georgia said, in my presence, that he was an\r\n\"ambassador\" from the sovereign State of Georgia [laughter] to the\r\nSenate of the United States. Suppose Ben. Hill should be caught in\r\nAfrica or India, or some of those Eastern nations, and should get\r\ninto a little difficulty, do you think he would raise the great flag\r\nof Georgia over his head [laughter] and say: \"That will protect me.\"\r\n[Renewed laughter and applause.] My fellow-citizens, you may take the\r\nbiggest ship that sails the ocean, put on board of her the flags of all\r\nthe States that were lately in the rebellion against this government,\r\nraise to her peak the stars and bars of the rebellion, start her with\r\nall her bunting floating to the breeze, sail her around the world, and\r\nyou would not get a salute of one popgun from any fort on earth. [Loud\r\nand continued laughter and applause.] Take the smallest ship that sails\r\nthe ocean, mark her \"U. S. A.\"--United States of America--raise to her\r\npeak the Stars and Stripes, and sail her around the world, and there\r\nis not a fort or a ship-of-war of any nation on God's footstool that\r\nwould not receive her with a national salute. [Cheers.] And yet the\r\nRepublican party has done all this. We took your government when it was\r\ndespised among the nations, and we have raised it to this high point of\r\nhonor; and yet you tell us we ought to die. [Laughter and applause.]\r\n\r\nSuppose there was a manufacturing concern here that failed about the\r\nyear 1837, and the citizens of Chicago thought it very important that\r\nit be reorganized and resume business. You would buy the property for\r\nfifty cents on the dollar and reorganize it under your general laws,\r\nelect officers, and look about for a competent man to manage it.\r\nFinally you find what you believe to be the very man for that business\r\nand put him in possession. He finds that the machinery is not up to\r\nthe progress of the age, and goes and buys new. He brings order out of\r\nconfusion, he manages the business so that the stock of the concern\r\nrises to par; dividends are paid semi-annually and they grow larger\r\nand larger. The stock rises to two hundred, and none for sale. After\r\neighteen years of successful management the manager comes in with his\r\naccount-current and his check for the half-yearly dividend, and lays it\r\nbefore the president and the directors. The president has had a little\r\nconversation with his directors, and says:\r\n\r\n\"This statement is very satisfactory, but we have concluded that after\r\nthe first day of July next we shall not require your services any\r\nlonger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" says the manager, \"what have I done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing that is not praiseworthy. We will give you a certificate\r\nthat we think you have managed this establishment with great ability\r\nand great success. We will certify that we think you have no equal in\r\nthe city of Chicago or State of Illinois. Everything you have done\r\nis praiseworthy, and we give you full credit for it; but eighteen\r\nyears ago one of our employes was caught stealing and sent to the\r\npenitentiary. He has now served his time out, and we propose to put him\r\nin your place.\" [Prolonged laughter and cheers.] Wouldn't you say that\r\nthe president and all of the directors should be put into a lunatic\r\nasylum on suspicion at once? [Applause and laughter.]\r\n\r\nNow, I tell you, Mr. Chairman, the mission of the Republican party is\r\nnot ended. [Cheers.] I tell you, furthermore, Mr. Chairman, that it has\r\njust begun. [Cheers.] I tell you, furthermore, that it will never end\r\nuntil you and I can start from the Canada border, travel to the Gulf of\r\nMexico, make black Republican speeches wherever we please [applause],\r\nvote the black Republican ticket wherever we gain a residence [cheers],\r\nand do it with exactly the same safety that a rebel can travel\r\nthroughout the North, stop wherever he has a mind to, and run for judge\r\nin any city he chooses.\r\n\r\n[This hit at the Democratic candidate for judge of the Cook County\r\nSuperior Court, who was a rebel soldier during the war, set the\r\naudience wild, and they cheered and swung their hats and handkerchiefs\r\nfrantically.]\r\n\r\nI hope after you have elected him judge he won't bring you in a bill\r\nfor loss of time. [Laughter.]\r\n\r\nYou are going to hold an election next Tuesday which is of importance\r\nfar beyond the borders of Chicago. The eyes of the whole nation\r\nare upon you. By your verdict next Tuesday you are to send forth\r\ngreeting to the people of the United States, saying, that either\r\nyou are in favor of honest men, honest money, patriotism, and a\r\nNational Government [cheers], or that you are in favor of soft money,\r\nrepudiation, and rebel rule. [Cheers.] It is a good symptom, Mr.\r\nChairman, to see 600 young men like you in line, prepared to carry the\r\nflag of the Republican party forward to victory. [Cheers.] It is a good\r\nsymptom to see 600 young men like my friend, the chairman here, in the\r\nfront ranks, ready to fight the battles of their country now, and vote\r\nas they shot during the war. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nNow, I want every single man in this vast audience to consider himself\r\na committee of one to work from now until the polls close on Tuesday\r\nnext. [Cheers.] Find a man who might stay away, who has gone away\r\nand might not return; secure one man besides yourself to go to the\r\npolls and vote the Republican ticket; and if you cannot find such a\r\nman, try to convert a sinner from the error of his way. [Applause.]\r\nYou have got too much at stake to risk it at this election. The times\r\nare too good. Iron brings too much. Lumber is too high. Your business\r\nis too prosperous. Your manufactories are making too much money for\r\nyou to afford to turn this great government over to the hands of\r\nrepudiating rebels. You cannot do it. Shut up your stores. Shut up your\r\nmanufactories. Go to work for your country, and spend two days, and on\r\nthe night of election, Mr. Chairman, send me a dispatch, if you please,\r\nthat Chicago has gone overwhelmingly Republican. [Loud cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DORIC PILLAR OF MICHIGAN.\r\n\r\nA MEMORIAL ADDRESS,\r\n\r\nDELIVERED IN THE FORT STREET PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, DETROIT, MICH.,\r\nTHURSDAY MORNING, NOV. 27, 1879,\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nTHE REV. ARTHUR T. PIERSON, D. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There were giants in the earth in those days,\" is the simple record of\r\nthe age before the flood.\r\n\r\nThere has been no age without its giants; not, perhaps, in the narrow\r\nsense of great physical stature, but in the broader sense of mental\r\nmight, capacity to command and control. Such men are but few, in\r\nthe most favored times, and it takes but few to give shape to human\r\nhistory and destiny. Their words shake the world; their deeds move and\r\nmold humanity; and, as Carlyle has suggested, history is but their\r\nlengthened shadows, the indefinite prolonging of their influence even\r\nafter they are dead.\r\n\r\nOne of these giants has recently fallen, at the commanding signal\r\nof One who is far greater than any of the sons of men, and at whose\r\ntouch kings drop their sceptre, and, like the meanest of their slaves,\r\ncrumble to dust.\r\n\r\nThis giant fell among us. We had seen him as he grew to his great\r\nstature and rose to his throne of power. He moved in our streets; he\r\nspoke in our halls; in our city of the living was his earthly home,\r\nand in our city of the dead is his place of rest. He went from us\r\nto the nation's capital, to represent our State in the Senate of\r\nthe republic; he belonged to Michigan, and Michigan gave him to the\r\nUnion; but he never forgot the home of his manhood. Here his dearest\r\ninterests clustered, and his deepest affections gathered; and here his\r\nmost loving memorial will be reared. As he belonged peculiarly to this\r\ncongregation, surely it is our privilege to weave the first wreath to\r\ngarland his memory.\r\n\r\nThe annual Day of Thanksgiving is peculiarly a national day, since\r\nit is the only one in the year when the whole nation is called upon\r\nby its chief magistrate to give thanks as a united people. By common\r\nconsent, it is admitted proper that, on that day, special mention be\r\nmade of matters that affect our civil and political well-being. There\r\nis therefore an eminent fitness in a formal commemoration upon this day\r\nof the life and labors of our departed Senator and statesman.\r\n\r\nWith diffidence I attempt the task that falls to me. The time is too\r\nshort to admit even a brief sketch of a life so long in deeds, so\r\neventful in all that makes material for biography; a life full, not\r\nonly of incidents, but of crises; moreover, I am neither a senator nor\r\na statesman, and feel incompetent to review a career which only the\r\nkeen eye of one versed in affairs of state can apprehend or appreciate\r\nin its full significance; but, if you will indulge me, I will,\r\nwithout conscious partiality or partisanship, calmly give utterance\r\nto the unspoken verdict of the common people as to our departed\r\nfellow-citizen; and try to hint at least a few of the lessons of a life\r\nthat suggests some of the secrets of success.\r\n\r\nHistory is the most profitable of all studies, and biography is the key\r\nof history. In the lives of men, philosophy teaches us by examples. In\r\nthe analysis of character, we detect the essential elements of success\r\nand discern the causes of failure. Virtue and vice impress us most in\r\nconcrete forms; and hence even the best of all books enshrines as its\r\npriceless jewel the story of the only perfect life.\r\n\r\nTo draw even the profile of Mr. Chandler's public career the proper\r\nlimits of this address do not allow. There is material, in the twenty\r\nyears of his senatorial life, which could be spread through volumes.\r\nHis advocacy of the great Northwest, whose champion he was; his\r\nmaster-influence, first as a member, and then as the chairman of the\r\nCommittee of Commerce; his bold, keen dissection of the Harper's Ferry\r\npanic; his sagacious organization of the presidential contests; his\r\nplain declarations of loyalty to the Union as something which must be\r\nmaintained at cost both of treasure and of blood; his large practical\r\nfaculty for administration, made so conspicuous during stormy times;\r\nhis efficiency as a member of the standing Committee on the Conduct of\r\nthe War; his exposure of those who were responsible for its failures,\r\nand his defense of those who promoted its successes, his marked\r\ninfluence in changing not only the channel of public sentiment, but\r\nthe current of events; his watchful guardianship of popular interests,\r\npolitical and financial; his intelligence and activity in senatorial\r\ndebates; his attentive and persistent study of the problem of\r\nreconstruction; and his fearless resistance to all Southern aggression\r\nand intimidation, are among the salient points of that long and\r\neventful public service, whose scope is too wide to allow at this hour\r\neven a hasty survey.\r\n\r\nBut, happily, it is quite needless that in such a presence I should\r\ntrace in detail the events of his life; to us he was no stranger; and\r\nthe mark he has made upon our memory and our history is too deep not\r\nto last. His footprints are not left upon treacherous and shifting\r\nquicksands; and no wave of oblivion is likely soon to wash them away.\r\n\r\nZachariah Chandler had nearly completed his sixty-sixth year; forty-six\r\nyears he had been a resident of the City of the Straits. New Hampshire\r\nwas the State of his nativity: Michigan was, in an emphatic sense,\r\nthe State of his adoption. In our city his first success was won in\r\nmercantile pursuits, where also was the first field for the exhibition\r\nof his energy, ability and integrity. Here, as this century passed\r\nits meridian hour, he passed the great turning-point in his career;\r\nand his large capacities and energies were diverted into a political\r\nchannel. First, Mayor of the city, then nominated for Governor; when,\r\nmore than twenty years ago, a successor was sought for Lewis Cass in\r\nthe Senate, this already marked man became the first representative of\r\nthe Republican party of this State in that august body at Washington.\r\nThere, for a period of eighteen years, he sat among the mightiest men\r\nof the nation, steadily moving toward the acknowledged leadership of\r\nhis party, and the inevitable command of public affairs. After three\r\nterms in the Senate, his seat was occupied for a short time by another;\r\nbut, upon the resignation of Mr. Christiancy, he was, with no little\r\nenthusiasm, re-elected, and was in the midst of a fourth term, when\r\nsuddenly he was no more numbered among the living. It may be doubled\r\nwhether, at this time, any one man, from Maine to Mexico, swayed the\r\npopular mind and will with a more potent sceptre than did he; and many\r\nconfidently believe and affirm that, had death spared him, he would\r\nhave been lifted by the omnipotent voice and vote of the people to the\r\nPresidency of the Republic.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler took his seat in the Senate in those days of strife when\r\nthe storm was gathering, which, on the memorable 12th of April, 1861,\r\nburst upon our heads, in the first gun fired at Fort Sumter. He entered\r\nthe Senate chamber, to take the oath of office, in company with some\r\nwhose names are now either famous or infamous for all time. On the one\r\nhand, there was Jefferson Davis; on the other Hannibal Hamlin, Charles\r\nSumner, Benjamin F. Wade and Simon Cameron.\r\n\r\nThose were days when history is made fast. Every day throbbed with\r\nbig issues. Kansas was a battle-ground of freedom; and the awful\r\nstruggle between State Sovereignty and National Unity was gathering,\r\nlike a volcano, for its terrible outbreak. The Republican Senator from\r\nMichigan took in, at a glance, the situation of affairs. Devoted as\r\nhe was to the State, whose able advocate and zealous friend he was;\r\nearnest and persistent as he was, in promoting the commercial and\r\nindustrial interests of the lake region; he was yet too much a patriot\r\nto forget the whole country; and as the great conflict, which Mr.\r\nSeward named \"irrepressible,\" moved steadily on toward its crisis, he\r\narmed himself for the encounter and planted his feet upon the rock of\r\nunalterable allegiance to the Union; and from that position he never\r\nswerved.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler was a zealous party-man; in the eyes of some he was a\r\npartisan, in the strenuous advocacy of some measures; but I believe\r\nthat when history frames her ultimate, impartial verdict, she will\r\naccord to him a candid, conscientious adherence to what he believed\r\nto be a fundamental principle, absolutely essential to our national\r\nlife. He saw the South breathing hot hate toward the North, planning\r\nand threatening to rend the Union asunder. To him it was not a question\r\nsimply of liberty and slavery, of sectional prejudice, of political\r\nanimosity; but a matter of life or of death. He saw the scimitar of\r\nsecession raised in the gigantic hand of war--but what was it that it\r\nwas proposed to cleave in twain at one blow? A living, vital form!\r\nthe body of a nation, with its one grand framework, its common brain\r\nand heart, its network of arteries and veins and nerves. It was not\r\ndissection as of a corpse--it was vivisection as of a corpus--that\r\nsharp blade, if it fell, would cut through a living form, and leave\r\ntwo quivering, bleeding parts, instead. Divide the nation? Why, the\r\nsame mountain ranges run down our eastern and western shores; the same\r\ngreat rivers, which are the arteries of our commerce, flow through both\r\nsections. Our republic is a unit by the decree of nature, that marked\r\nour nation's area and arena by the lines of territorial unity, a unit\r\nby the decree of history that records one series of common experiences;\r\nand, aside from the decree of nature and of history, it is one by the\r\ndecree of necessity, for we could not survive the separation. Those\r\nwere the decisive days, and they showed whose heart was yearning toward\r\nthe child; and God said, as he saw a unanimous North pleading with Him\r\nto arrest the falling sword and spare the living body of a nation's\r\nlife--\"Give her the child, for she is the mother thereof!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler has been charged with violent and even vindictive feeling\r\ntoward what he deemed disloyalty and treason.\r\n\r\nYou have heard the story of the Russians, chased by a hungry pack of\r\nwolves, driving at the height of speed over the crisp snow, finding\r\nthe beasts of prey gaining fast upon them, and throwing out one living\r\nchild after another to appease the maw of wolfish hunger, while the\r\nrest of the family hurried on toward safety.\r\n\r\nThere are sagacious statesmen that have declared, for a quarter of\r\na century, that State Rights represents the pack of wolves and the\r\nSovereignty of the Union the imperilled household. For scores of years,\r\nthe encroachments of the South became more and more imperious and\r\nalarming.\r\n\r\nConcession after concession was made, offering after offering flung to\r\nthe sacrifice, but only to be followed by a hungrier clamor and demand\r\nfor more; and, at last, even men of peace said, \"We must stop right\r\nhere and fight these wolves;\" and, when it becomes a question of life\r\nand death, men become desperate.\r\n\r\nI have never supposed myself to be a strong partisan. As a man, a\r\ncitizen, and a Christian, I have sought to find the true political\r\nfaith, and, finding it, to hold it, firmly and fearlessly. The question\r\nof the unity of our nation and the sovereignty of the national\r\ngovernment has ever seemed to me to be of supreme moment, transcending\r\nall mere political or party issues; and, as a patriot, I cannot be\r\nindifferent to it.\r\n\r\nWhen the long struggle between State Rights and National Sovereignty\r\ngrew hot and broke out into civil war, it was a matter of tremendous\r\nconsequence that the Union be preserved. History stood pointing, with\r\nsolemn finger, to the fate of the republics of Greece and Switzerland,\r\nreminding us that confederation alone will not suffice to keep a nation\r\nalive. Mexico, at our borders, was a warning against dismemberment\r\nor the loss of the supremacy of a republican unity. And men of all\r\nparties forgot party issues in patriotic devotion. It may be a question\r\nwhether State Sovereignty, however fatal to national life, deserved\r\nthe hideous name of treason, before the war. But, after the matter had\r\nbeen referred to the arbitrament of the sword, and had been settled at\r\nsuch cost of blood and treasure, it can never henceforth be anything\r\nbut treason, again to raise that issue. Hence, even men that were\r\ntemperate in their opposition to Southern aggressions before the war,\r\nnow are impatient. They set their teeth with the resolution of despair,\r\nand say, \"We make no further effort to escape this issue, and we throw\r\nout no more offerings of concession. We shall fight these wolves; and\r\neither State Rights or National Sovereignty shall die.\"\r\n\r\nThis was Mr. Chandler's position; if it was a mistaken one, it is the\r\nunspoken verdict of millions of the best men of all parties in the\r\nwhole country; and every new concession to this great national heresy\r\nis only making new converts to the necessity of a firm and fearless\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nSome one has suggested that the old division of the church into\r\nmilitant and triumphant is no longer sufficient; we must add another,\r\nnamely, the church termagant. In our country both sections were\r\nmilitant, and one was triumphant; the other has been very termagant\r\never since. General Grant, at his reception in Chicago, declared that\r\nthe war for the Union had put the republic on a new footing abroad. A\r\nquarter of a century ago, by political leaders across the sea, \"it was\r\nbelieved we had no nation. It was merely a confederation of States,\r\ntied together by a rope of sand, and would give way upon the slightest\r\nfriction. They have found it was a grand mistake. They know we have\r\nnow a nation, that we are a nation of strong and intelligent and brave\r\npeople, capable of judging and knowing our rights, and determined on\r\nall occasions to maintain them against either domestic or foreign foes;\r\nand that is the reception you, as a nation, have received through me\r\nwhile I was abroad.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same day we have a significant voice from the South, General\r\nToombs, in response to a suggestion that Governors of various States\r\nand prominent Southern men should unite in congratulations to the\r\nex-President on his return, telegraphs in these words: \"I decline to\r\nanswer except to say, I present my personal congratulations to General\r\nGrant on his safe return to his country. He fought for his country\r\nhonorably and won. I fought for mine and lost. I am ready to try it\r\nover! Death to the Union!\"\r\n\r\nHere we have simply two representative utterances; one is the voice\r\nof a solid North; the other is, we fear, the voice of a South that\r\nis much more \"solid\" than we could wish. It is no marvel if, after a\r\nwar of so many years, that cost so many lives and so much money, and\r\nleft us to drag through ten years of a financial slough, loyal men are\r\nimpatient and even angry, when they discover that the question is still\r\nan unsettled one, and that we have not even conquered a peace! Even\r\nthe interpretation now attached to this seditious utterance by General\r\nToombs himself, that \"the result of war was death to the Union, and\r\nthat the present government is a consolidated one, not a confederacy,\"\r\ndoes not essentially relieve the matter.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler could not brook what he regarded as sentiments rendered\r\ndoubly treasonable by the fact that a long, bitter but successful war\r\nhad burned upon them with a hot iron the brand of treason. He fought\r\nthose sentiments, and it was as under a black flag that announced \"no\r\nquarter.\" But this does not prove malicious or vindictive feeling\r\ntoward misguided men who hold such views. There is a difference between\r\nfighting a principle and fighting a person. In fact the only way to\r\nprevent fighting men is often a vigorous and timely opposition to\r\ntheir measures. And if we wish to avoid another war, and that a war of\r\nextermination, the ballot must obviate the necessity for the bullet: we\r\nmust stand together, and by our voice and vote, by tongue and pen, by\r\nour laws and our acts, in the use of every keen weapon, exterminate the\r\nheresy of State Rights. We need not do this in hate toward the South:\r\na true love even for the South demands it, for to them as to us it is\r\na deadly foe to all true prosperity and national existence. How can a\r\nman who candidly looks upon the present attitude of the South as both\r\nsuicidal and nationally destructive be calm and cool? The philippics of\r\nDemosthenes were bitter, but they were the mighty beatings of a heart\r\nthat pulsed with the patriotism that could not see liberty throttled\r\nwithout sounding a loud and indignant alarm. The North owes a big debt\r\nto every man who at this crisis will not suffer an imperilled republic\r\nto sleep.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler was not a college graduate. His early training was got in\r\nthe New England common school and academy. Yet he was in a true sense\r\nan educated man: for education is \"not a dead mass of accumulations,\"\r\nbut self-development, \"power to work with the brain,\" to use the hand\r\nin cunning and curious industries, to use the tongue in attractive and\r\neffective speech, to use the pen in wise, witty or weighty paragraphs.\r\nSomehow he had learned to hold, with a master hand, the reins of his\r\nown mind, and make his imagination and reason and memory and powers of\r\nspeech obey his behests. That is no common acquirement: it is something\r\nbeyond all mere acquirement; it is the infallible sign and seal of\r\nculture. His addresses, even on critical occasions, were unwritten,\r\nand, in some cases, could not have been elaborated, even in the mind;\r\nyet in vigor of thought, logical continuity and consistency, accuracy\r\nof diction, and even rhetorical grace, few public speakers equal them.\r\n\r\nThe power to command the popular ear is a rare power, whether it be a\r\ngift of nature or a grace of culture. With Mr. Chandler it was held\r\nand wielded as a native sceptre. He had the secret of rhetorical\r\nadaptation; he could at once go down to the level of the people and\r\nyet lift them to his level. They understood what he said and knew what\r\nhe meant. He threw himself into their modes of thought and habits of\r\nspeech; he culled his illustrations mainly from common life. If he\r\nsacrificed anything, it was rhetorical elegance, never force; his one\r\naim was to compel conviction.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of his diction was a prime element and secret of his\r\npower. He did not speak as one who had to say something, but as one\r\nwho had something to say, and whose whole aim was to say it well; with\r\nclearness, plainness, force and effect. If he could not have both\r\nweight and lustre, he would have weight.\r\n\r\nWalter Scott has exposed the absurdity of \"writing down\" to children,\r\nand shown that it is really writing up, to make oneself so simple as\r\nto be plain even to the child-mind. Simplicity is the highest art. To\r\nhave thought faintly gloom and glimmer through obscure language, like\r\nstars through a haze or mist, may serve to impress the ignorant with a\r\nsupposed profundity in the speaker; but it is no more a sign of such\r\nprofundity than muddy water signifies depth in a stream; it may suggest\r\ndepth because you can see no bottom, but it means shallowness! It is\r\na lesson that all of us may learn through the life of our departed\r\nSenator, that the first element of good speaking is thought; and the\r\nsecond a form of words fitting the thought, which, like true dress,\r\nshall not call attention to itself but to the idea or conception which\r\nit clothes. Any man who is long to hold the ear of the people must\r\ngive them facts and thoughts worth knowing and thinking of, in words\r\nwhich it will not take a walking dictionary or living encyclopædia\r\nto interpret, or a philosopher to untangle from the skein of their\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler was such a man, a man for the people. Free from all\r\nstately airs and stilted dignities, he took hold of every political\r\nand national question with ungloved hands. He understood and used the\r\nlanguage of home life, which is the \"universal dialect\" of power. His\r\nspeeches were packed with vigorous Saxon. He thought more of the short\r\nsword, with its sharp edge and keen point and close thrust, than of\r\nthe scholar's labored latinity, with its longer blade, even though it\r\nmight also have a diamond-decked hilt; and in this, as in not a few\r\nother conspicuous traits, he was master of the best secrets that gave\r\nthe great Irish agitator, O'Connell, his strange power of moving the\r\nmultitude. His last speech, even when read, and without the magnetism\r\nof his personal presence, may well stand as the last of his utterances.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of Mr. Chandler's style of oratory amounted to\r\nruggedness, in the sense in which we apply that word to the naked\r\nnaturalness of a landscape, whose features have not been too much\r\nmodified by art. There is in oratory an excessive polish, which\r\nsuggests coldness and deadness. Some speakers sharpen the blade until\r\nthere is no blade left, the mistaken carefulness of their culture\r\nbrings everything to one dead level of faultlessness; there is nothing\r\nto offend, and nothing to rouse and move. Demosthenes said that\r\nkinésis--not \"action,\" but motion, or rather that which moves--is the\r\nfirst, second, third requisite of true oratory. He is no true speaker\r\nwho simply pleases you: he must stir you to new thought, new choice,\r\nnew action.\r\n\r\nWe must beware of the polish that is a loss of power, and, like a\r\nlapidary, not grind off points, but grind into points. Demosthenes was\r\nmore rugged than Cicero; but he pricked men more with the point of his\r\noratorical goad. Men heard the silver-tongued Roman and said, \"How\r\npleasantly he speaks!\" They heard the bold Athenian and shouted, \"Let\r\nus go and fight Philip!\"\r\n\r\nCarlyle says, \"He is God's anointed king whose simple word can melt a\r\nmillion wills into his!\" That melting wills into his own is the test of\r\neloquence in the orator; and a rugged simplicity has held men in the\r\nvery fire of the orator's ardor and fervor, till they were at white\r\nheat, and could be shaped at will; while the most scholarly display of\r\nculture often leaves them unmoved, to gape and stare with wonder, as\r\nbefore the splendors of the Aurora Borealis, and feel as little real\r\nwarmth. Emerson is right: \"There is no true eloquence unless there is a\r\nman behind the speech,\" and men care not what the speech is if the man\r\nbe not behind it, or, on the other hand, what the speech is, if the man\r\nbe behind it! And so it is that Richard Cobden compelled even Robert\r\nPeel, who loved truth and candor, to become a convert to his free-trade\r\nopinions; and so it was that John Bright, another model of a simple\r\nutterance with a sincere man behind it, swayed such a mighty sceptre\r\nover the people of Britain. The mere declaimer or demagogue may win a\r\ntemporary hearing; but the man who leaves a lasting impress on the mind\r\nof the people must have in himself some real worth.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Chandler's executive ability reference has been made. It\r\nwas never better illustrated than in his vigorous and faithful\r\nadministration as Secretary of the Interior. It was Hercules in the\r\nAugean stables again--purging the department of incompetency and\r\ndishonesty. He sent a flood through the Patent Office, that swept all\r\nthe clerks out of one room; and another through the Indian Bureau,\r\nthat cleaned out its abuses and exposed its frauds. It is said that\r\nthe reconstruction of that department saved millions annually to the\r\ntreasury of the nation. Mr. Schurz, in becoming his successor, paid\r\na very handsome tribute to the retiring Secretary, acknowledging the\r\ngreat debt of the country to Mr. Chandler's energy and fidelity, and\r\nmodestly declaring that he could hope for no higher success than to\r\nkeep and leave the department where he found it.\r\n\r\nIf there be any one thing for which the Senator from Michigan stood\r\nabove most men it was in this practical business ability. He had, in\r\nrare union, \"talent\" and \"tact.\" His good sense, clear views, ready\r\nand retentive memory, prompt decision, patience and perseverance, quick\r\ndiscernment and instinctive perception of the fitness of ways to ends,\r\nqualified him for energetic and successful administration anywhere.\r\nWebster said, \"There is always room at the top.\" Even the pyramid waits\r\nfor the capstone, which must be, itself, a little pyramid. And he who\r\nhas inborn or inbred fitness for the top place will find his way there;\r\nno other will long stay there, even if some accident lifts him to the\r\nnominal occupancy of such a position.\r\n\r\nHe had rare tact, that indefinable quality of which Ross says, that\r\n\"it is the most exquisite thing in man.\" Literally it means \"touch,\"\r\nand is suggested by the delicacy often found in that mysterious sense.\r\nIt describes, though it cannot define, the nice, skillful, innate\r\ndiscernment and discrimination which tells one what to say and do, even\r\non critical occasions; how to reach and \"touch\" men, when a blunder\r\nwould be fatal. This wisdom of instinct may be cultivated but cannot be\r\nacquired; and it seems to be close of kin with that common sense which,\r\nthough by no means exceedingly \"common,\" represents a sound intuitive\r\nsense in common matters, such as would be the common sense or verdict\r\nof wise and sagacious minds.\r\n\r\nThe Senator impressed men as one whose powers were varied and\r\nversatile. Thomas F. Marshall, the \"Kentucky orator,\" maintained that\r\nfine speaking, writing and conversation depend on a different order of\r\ngifts. \"A speech cannot be reported, nor an essay spoken. Fox wrote\r\nspeeches; nobody reads them. Sir James Mackintosh spoke essays; nobody\r\nlistened. Yet England crowded to hear Fox, and reads Mackintosh. Lord\r\nBolingbroke excelled in all, the ablest orator, finest writer, most\r\nelegant drawing-room gentleman in England.\"\r\n\r\nWhether or not this philosophy be sound and this estimate correct, we\r\nshall all agree that few men combine power of speech with force in\r\ncomposition and grace in conversation. Our departed Senator certainly\r\nhad more than the common share of versatility. That last speech at\r\nChicago thrilled a vast audience when spoken, and kindled a flaming\r\nenthusiasm; yet it reads like the compact and complete sentences of the\r\nessayist.\r\n\r\nVersatility, however, is not to be coveted where it implies a lack of\r\nconcentration. An anonymous writer has left us a very discriminating\r\ncomparison of two great British statesmen. He likens Canning's mind to\r\na convex speculum which scattered its rays of light upon all objects;\r\nwhile he likens Brougham's to a concave speculum which concentrated the\r\nrays upon one central, burning, focal point. There are some men who\r\npossess, to a considerable degree, both the power to scatter and the\r\npower to gather the rays. At times they exhibit varied and versatile\r\nability, they touch delicately and skillfully many different themes or\r\ndepartments of thought and action; but when crises arise which demand\r\nthe whole man, they become in the best sense men of one idea, for one\r\nthought fills and fires the soul; every power is concentrated in one\r\nburning purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Senator, whose deserved garland we are weaving, was one of these\r\nmen. There were times when he seemed to turn his hand with equal\r\nease to a score of employments; now giving wise counsel in gravest\r\nmatters, now playfully entertaining guests at his table; now studying\r\nthe deep philosophy of political economy, now holding a Senate in\r\nrapt attention; now reorganizing a department of state; now pushing\r\na new measure through Congress; now closeted with the President over\r\nthe issues of a colossal campaign, and again conducting a pleasure\r\nexcursion; to-day leading on the hosts of a great party, and to-morrow\r\nmanaging the affairs of an extensive farm. But, when the destiny of\r\nthe nation hung in the balance, or history waited with uplifted pen to\r\nrecord on her eternal scroll the final decision of some great question,\r\nhe gathered and condensed into absolute unity all the powers of mind\r\nand heart and will, and flung the combined weight of his whole manhood\r\ninto the trembling scale. When he felt that a thing must be, a mountain\r\nwas no obstacle to surmount, a host of foes no occasion for dismay.\r\nWith intensity of conviction, with contagious courage and enthusiasm,\r\nwith indomitable resolution, with tireless energy of action, he\r\nwent ahead, and weaker men had to follow; his conviction persuaded\r\nthe hesitating, his courage emboldened the timid, his determination\r\ninspired the irresolute. He was the unit that, in the leading place,\r\nmakes even the cyphers swell the sum of power.\r\n\r\nIt is no slight praise of Mr. Chandler to say that he was a man of\r\nindustry; the results he reached were won by work. There is a great\r\ndeal of blind talk about genius. That there is such a thing, apart\r\nfrom the practical faculty of application, even great men have doubted\r\nor boldly denied; but certain it is that there is such a thing as\r\nthe genius of industry, and that rules the world! Alexander Hamilton\r\ndisclaimed any other genius than the profound study of a subject. He\r\nkept before him a theme which he meant to master, till he explored it\r\nin all its bearings and his mind was filled with it. Then, to quote\r\nhis words, \"the effort which I make the people are pleased to call the\r\nfruit of genius. It is the fruit of labor and thought.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so for us all there is no royal road to a true success. We must\r\nsimply plod on, along the plain, hard, plebeian path of honest toil,\r\nand climb up the hills, if we would get on and up at all. Spinoza\r\ngrandly says that that there is no foe or barrier to progress like\r\n\"self-conceit and the laziness which self-conceit begets.\" We venture\r\nto add that no conceit is surer to beget laziness than the conceit\r\nof \"conscious genius.\" Our peril is to learn to do our work easily;\r\nthat means poor work, if indeed any work at all, shallow acquirements,\r\nsuperficial attainments, and no real scholarly or heroic achievements.\r\n\r\nOur regretted Senator did not despise honest work, and never claimed\r\nto be a genius. He had a hearty contempt for all that aristocracy of\r\nintellect that frowns on mental toil.\r\n\r\nHe spoke without manuscript, and without memorizing; or, as we say,\r\n\"extempore.\" That is another much-abused word. Extemporaneous speech\r\nis not the utterance of words that shake the world, or any considerable\r\npart of it, unless such speech be the fruit not of that time, but,\r\nas Dr. Shedd says, \"of all time previous.\" But when the orator first\r\nbecomes master of his theme and then of the occasion, and is thus\r\nfitted to deal with the real vital issues before the people, he may,\r\nwithout having put pen to paper, or having framed a single sentence\r\nbeforehand, often find himself master also of his audience. The careful\r\nstudy of his subject, the habit of thinking in words, and of weighing\r\nwords when he reads and talks, scoops out a channel in the mind; and\r\nwhen he rises to speak he finds his thought flowing naturally and\r\neasily in this channel.\r\n\r\nNo man can carefully read Mr. Chandler's public utterances without\r\ndetecting a brevity and terseness, a simplicity and plainness, an\r\naccuracy and vigor, and often a rhetorical beauty, which shew care in\r\npreparation. These qualities are not the offspring of indolence. Years\r\nof drill lie back of the exact and daring touches with which the artist\r\nmakes the canvas speak and the marble breathe; and the extempore speech\r\nof the eloquent orator tells of long, hard discipline that has taught\r\nhim how to think and how to talk; it may have taken him fifty years to\r\nlearn how to hold and sway an audience at will for fifty minutes. The\r\nease and grace of true oratory are the signs of previous exertion; of\r\nthat systematic exercise of the intellect that has suggested for our\r\ntraining schools the name, gymnasia. The laws of brain and of brawn do\r\nnot differ much in this respect. Men are not born athletes, either in\r\nmind or muscle; and to all who have a true desire to succeed, in any\r\nsphere of life, the one voice that, with the growing emphasis of the\r\nsuccessive centuries, speaks to us, is, \"Whatsoever thy hand findeth\r\nto do, do it with thy might.\" Your sword may be short; \"add a step to\r\nit!\" it may be dull; add force to the blow or the thrust. There is no\r\nencouragement from history, more universally to be appropriated by\r\nus, than the testimony she furnishes to the power and value of honest\r\nendeavor. To will and to work is to win. The highest endowments assure\r\nno achievements; all success is the crown of patient toil!\r\n\r\nWhile thus speaking a word in favor of hard work, one word of caution\r\nand of qualification may not be out of place. I think God means that\r\nthe sudden decease of public men when in life's prime, shall not be\r\nwithout warning. No thoughtful man fails to feel the force of this\r\nfact that somehow the average duration of human life, especially on\r\nthese shores and among men of mark, is shortening; and that apoplexy,\r\nparalysis, angina pectoris, cerebral hemorrhage, and softening of the\r\nbrain are amazingly common among brain-workers. The fatality among\r\njournalists is especially startling.\r\n\r\nWe are a fast-living and a fast-dying people. Our habits are bad. We\r\nwork hard half the time and worry the other half. We eat and sleep\r\nirregularly; we tax our powers unduly, keeping the bow bent until\r\nthe string snaps simply from constant tension, lack of relaxation.\r\nWe turn night into day, without restoring the balance by turning day\r\ninto night. We live in an atmosphere of excitement, and push on to\r\nthe verge of death before we know our peril or realize our risk. We\r\nare tempted to put stimulus in the place of strength, that we may do,\r\nunder unnatural pressure, what we cannot do by nature's healthy powers.\r\nInstead of repairing the engine, we crowd fuel into the boiler and get\r\nup more steam; and, by and by, something breaks, or bursts, and the\r\nmachinery is a wreck.\r\n\r\nI believe it is not hard work that kills us, so much as work under\r\nwrong conditions. To do, with the aid of even mild stimulants, like tea\r\nand coffee, not to say tobacco, opium, quinine, etc., what we cannot\r\ndo by the natural strength, is the worst kind of overwork; and yet our\r\npublic men are subject, to such strain, that they are almost driven to\r\nsuch resorts. Where they ought to stop, and sleep and rest, they \"key\r\nup\" with a kind of artificial strength, and get the habit of unnatural\r\nwakefulness; and then wonder why they are victims of insomnia.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tyndall, one of the most tireless men of brain in our day,\r\nsays to the students of University College, London: \"Take care of\r\nyour health! Imagine Hercules, as oarsman in a rotten boat; what can\r\nhe do there but, by the very force of his stroke, expedite the ruin\r\nof his craft! Take care of the timbers of your boat!\" And Dr. Beard\r\nadds: \"To work hard without overworking, to work without worrying, to\r\ndo just enough without doing too much--these are the great problems\r\nof our future. Our earlier Franklin taught us to combine industry\r\nwith economy; our 'later Franklin' taught us to combine industry with\r\ntemperance; our future Franklin--if one should arise--must teach us how\r\nto combine industry with the art of taking it easy.\"\r\n\r\nThe qualities that fitted Mr. Chandler for the conduct of affairs were,\r\nhowever, not purely intellectual; they belonged in part to another and\r\na higher order, viz.: the emotions and affections.\r\n\r\nHe had great intensity of nature. Even his political opponents could\r\nnot doubt the positiveness of his conviction and the profoundness of\r\nhis sincerity; and here, as Carlyle justly says, must be found the\r\nbase blocks in the structure of all heroic character. It is no small\r\nthing to be able to command even from an antagonist the concession and\r\nconfession of one's sincerity. Candor atones for a host of faults.\r\nMen will, at the last, forgive anything else in a man who tries to be\r\ntrue to his own convictions and to their interests. The utterances of\r\nimpulse and even of passion, stinging sarcasm and biting ridicule,\r\nunjust charges and assaults, all are easy to pardon in one whose\r\nsincerity and intensity of conviction betray him into too great heat;\r\nmen would rather be scorched or singed a little in the burning flame\r\nof a passionate earnestness than freeze in the atmosphere of a human\r\niceberg--beneath whose rhetorical brilliance, they feel the chill of a\r\ncold, calculating insincerity and hypocrisy that upsets their faith in\r\nhuman honesty.\r\n\r\nHe was also peculiarly independent and intrepid. The determination to\r\nbe loyal, both to his convictions and to his country, inspired him to a\r\nbold, brave utterance and invested him with a courage and confidence\r\nthat were almost contagious. We cannot but admire the political\r\nfidelity expressed by Burke, in his famous defense before the electors\r\nof Bristol, when he said: \"I obeyed the instructions of nature and\r\nreason and conscience; I maintained your interests, as against your\r\nconvictions.\" Few men have ever dared to say and do what Mr. Chandler\r\nhas, in the face of such political risks and even such personal peril.\r\nOne brief address delivered by him in the Senate, soon after he resumed\r\nhis seat, will stand among the classics of our language, and, if I may\r\nso say, among the \"heroics\" of our history.\r\n\r\nHe was also a man of great political integrity. In the long career of a\r\npublic life spanning more than a quarter of a century, no suspicion of\r\ndishonesty or disloyalty has ever stained his character or reputation.\r\nMichigan may safely challenge any Senatorial record of twenty years to\r\nsurpass his, either in the quantity or quality of public service.\r\n\r\nThose who knew him best affirm that he was, politically and personally,\r\nan incorruptible man. The position of a legislator is one of proverbial\r\nperil. From the days of Pericles and Augustus till now, the men\r\nwho make laws and guide national affairs are peculiarly in danger\r\nof defiling their consciences by \"fear or favor.\" Bribery sits in\r\nthe vestibule of every law-making assembly. Greed holds out golden\r\nopportunity for getting enormous profits from unlawful or questionable\r\nschemes and investments. Ambition lifts her shining crown, and offers\r\na throne of commanding influence if you will bow down and worship,\r\nor even make some slight concession in favor of, the devil. Only a\r\nlittle elasticity of conscience, a little blunting of the moral sense;\r\na little falsehood, or perjury, or treachery, under polite names; a\r\nlending of one's name to doubtful schemes; and there is a rich reward\r\nin gains to the purse and gratifications to the pride, which more than\r\npay for the trifling loss of self-respect. And so not a few who go\r\nto Congress with unsullied reputation, come back smutched with their\r\nparticipation in \"Credit Mobilier\" and \"Pacific Railroad\" schemes, or\r\nany one of the thousand forms of fraud.\r\n\r\nSo far as I know, Mr. Chandler has never been charged with complicity\r\nas to dishonest and disgraceful measures such as have sometimes made\r\nthe very atmosphere of the Capitol a stench in the nostrils of the pure\r\nand good. His name does not stand on the pay-roll of Satan, but with\r\nthe honored few whose eyes have never been blinded by a bribe and whose\r\nrecord has never been blotted with political dishonor.\r\n\r\nTo have simply done one's duty is no mean victory. To stand--like the\r\nanvil beneath the blows of the hammer--and firmly resist the force of\r\na repeated temptation is grand and heroic. To be venal is no venial\r\nfault; no price which can be weighed in gold can pay a man for the sale\r\nof one ounce of his manliness. Conscience is a Samson, whose locks are\r\neasily shorn, but they never grow again; whose eyes, once put out or\r\nseared with a hot iron, no prayer will restore. And men, as great and\r\nwise as Bacon, have like him been compelled to confess to their own\r\nmeanness and the mercenary character of their virtue.\r\n\r\nOne of the worst signs of the times is this corruptibility of popular\r\nleaders. One of the greatest of European journals moves like a\r\nweather-vane, just as the day's wind blows. Much of the best talent of\r\nEurope is for sale for or against despotism. Some of the most gifted\r\nmen in the House of Lords are of plebeian birth, bought by the bribe of\r\na title, as Harry Brougham himself was, when his great influence became\r\na terror to the aristocracy; and the Duke of Newcastle is said to have\r\nbought one-third of the House of Commons. There is scarce a measure,\r\nhowever infamous, that may not be pushed through our common councils\r\nand legislative bodies if the lobbyists are only \"influential and\r\nnumerous,\" and the money is only plenty enough. Let us give God thanks\r\nfor every man in the community who is not on the auction block to be\r\nknocked down to the highest bidder. In these days of abounding fraud\r\nand falsehood, men are beginning to feel the value of simple honesty.\r\nWe have, in our admiration of the genius of intellect, forgotten the\r\ngenius of goodness, which has power to inspire men with heroism. Better\r\nto strengthen a few timid hearts in loyalty to principle than to have\r\ndeserved the encomium of Augustus, who \"found Rome brick, and left\r\nit marble.\" The Earl of Chatham refused to keep a million pounds of\r\ngovernment funds in the bank and pocket the proceeds; as Edmund Burke,\r\non becoming paymaster-general, first of all introduced a bill for the\r\nreorganization of that department of public service, refusing to enrich\r\nhimself, through the emoluments of that lucrative office, at public\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nNo wonder George the Second should have said of such \"honesty\" that it\r\nis an \"honor to human nature!\" Such words were worthy of a king, but\r\nit is only a crowned head bowing to royal natures that need no crown\r\nto tell that they are kingly. The distinguished Hungarian exile will\r\nnever be forgiven for saying that he would praise anything and anybody\r\nto aid Hungary. There is an instinct in the great heart of humanity\r\nwhich not even wickedness kills, that no quality is so fundamental to\r\ncharacter as absolute loyalty to truth, it is the base-block of the\r\nwhole structure; and great has been many a \"fall,\" where there is no\r\nbetter foundation than the treacherous and shifting quicksands of what\r\nis called \"policy,\" and which is to many the only standard of honesty.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler was known in politics as an enthusiastic and radical\r\nadvocate of his party and its measures. It was not in him to do\r\nanything by halves, and it is difficult to see why one may not as\r\nnaturally be zealous in politics as in religion; in fact, none are\r\nmore likely to charge upon him partisanship than those who in their\r\nattachment to the opposite party shew their own lack of moderation.\r\n\r\nIt has been well said that religion demands \"a faith, a polity and a\r\nparty.\" The faith and the polity belong to it as necessary features;\r\nthe party is that on which it depends for organization and onward\r\nmovement. There is a philosophy, a political creed and economy, which\r\nare to the state what religion is to the church; and no man can be a\r\npatriot without a political faith and polity and party; though he may\r\nstand alone, he represents all three. He may be in the largest sense a\r\npatriot, and adopt the sublime motto of Demosthenes, \"Not father, nor\r\nmother, but dear native land!\" yet his patriotism may compel him, us he\r\nlooks at the matter of his country's interest, to take a position on\r\nthe side of a political party, and to hold it in the face of ridicule\r\nand reproach and even of a pelting hail of hate. Others may not be\r\nwrong in their espousal of a different political creed, but he is not\r\nwrong, but right, in his honest adherence to his. It is so in religion;\r\nan honest, intelligent man is loyal to his own denomination, yet is\r\nhe none the less, because of that, a Christian in the breadth of his\r\ncharity.\r\n\r\nIn fact, religion is not the only sphere where self-sacrifice, for duty\r\nand for conscience, may be pressed even to martyrdom. St. Ignatius,\r\nfacing the wild beasts in the arena, calmly said, \"I am grain of God; I\r\nmust be ground between teeth of lions to make bread for God's people.\"\r\nThat was the grand confession of a Christian martyr. Tell me, how much\r\nlower down in the scale of the heroic does he belong who, for the sake\r\nof the best good of a constituency blinded by passion or prejudice,\r\nlike the great English statesman, consents to be hurled from his shrine\r\nas the idol of the people, and calmly says, \"I am under no obligation\r\nto be popular, but I am under bonds to myself to be true!\" When\r\nRegulus refused to buy his own liberty and life, at the cost of Rome's\r\ndisgrace, and persuaded the Senate to reject the very overtures which\r\nhe was commissioned to convey, himself returning as his pledge required\r\nhim if the negotiations were unsuccessful, and surrendering himself to\r\nthe will of his enemies that Carthage might put him to death by slow\r\ntorture, it seems to me something like the martyr-spirit burned in that\r\nbosom. And, if there be nothing akin to moral martyrdom in bravely\r\nstanding in one's place and boldly holding one's ground, advocating\r\nwhat one believes to be the only true creed in politics, and the only\r\ntrue policy for the country, in face of sneer and threat, daring the\r\nblade and the bullet, the open affront and the secret assault, for the\r\nsake of being true to one's self and to one's native land--if there\r\nbe nothing sublime and heroic in all this, the verdict of reason is\r\nunsound.\r\n\r\nThis lamented statesman had also a genial temper, which won for him a\r\nhost of friends. Public men are prone to one of two extremes; either\r\nthe hypocritical suavity of the demagogue, or the arbitrary bluntness\r\nand curtness of the despot. Some swing away from the fawning airs of\r\nthe puppy, but it is toward the repulsive manners of the bear. The man\r\nwho, as you tip your hat with a polite good morning, sweeps by, saying,\r\n\"I haven't time,\" is too often the typical man of affairs, who thinks\r\nthe quick dismission of applicants and intruders is the price of all\r\nenergetic public service. It is said of the great French statesman,\r\nRichelieu, that he could say \"No.\" so gracefully and winningly, that\r\na man once became applicant for a position, upon which he had not\r\nthe least claim, just to hear the great Cardinal refuse. If common\r\ntestimony may be trusted, Michigan's esteemed Senator seldom lost the\r\nhearty cordiality and courtesy of his manners, even under the fretting\r\nfriction of public cares.\r\n\r\nI am tempted to add that, though a representative Republican, Mr.\r\nChandler was, in the best sense, a democrat. He weighed a man according\r\nto the worth of his manhood. He could recognize true manliness beneath\r\na black skin as well as a white one, and behind the rough dress of\r\na poor man, as behind broadcloth; and, because he was the friend of\r\nhumanity and of human rights, you will find some of his warmest friends\r\namong the common people and in the lower ranks.\r\n\r\nI think both justice and generosity demand that among the tributes\r\nwe weave for him, there should be distinct and emphatic mention of\r\nthis simplicity of character. He was a man among men. From the first,\r\nhe had none of those assumptions of conscious superiority that mark\r\nthe aristocrat. If anything, he was rather careless than careful of\r\nhis dignity, and would sooner shock than mock the fastidious airs\r\nand tastes of those who prate about culture, or pride themselves on\r\ntheir \"nobility.\" Fox quaintly said, of the elder Pitt, that he \"fell\r\nup stairs\" when he was elevated to the peerage. Many a man cannot\r\nstand going up higher. He becomes haughty, proud; he affects dignity,\r\nhe lords it over God's heritage, he becomes too big with conscious\r\nsuperiority. Like Jeshurun, he waxes fat and kicks. He falls up stairs,\r\nif not down.\r\n\r\nThe warm, soft, genial side of Mr. Chandler's nature was unveiled in\r\nsocial life and most of all in the domestic circle. The play of his\r\nsmile, the roar of his laughter, the delicacy and tenderness of his\r\nsympathy, his stalwart defense of those whom he loved, the childlike\r\ntraits that drew him to children and drew children to him, none\r\nappreciate as do those who knew him best as friend, husband and father.\r\nThe man of public affairs, he could lay one hand firmly on the helm of\r\nstate, while with the other he fondly pressed his grandchildren to his\r\nbosom, or playfully roused them to childish glee.\r\n\r\nThis aspect of his many-sided character makes his death an irreparable\r\nloss to his own household. Even the great grief of a nation cannot\r\nrepresent by its \"extensity,\" the intensity of the more private sorrow\r\nthat secludes itself from the public eye. He was, to those whom he\r\nspecially loved, both a tower for strength, and a lover and friend for\r\ncomfort and sympathy. Those who were \"at home\" with him and especially\r\nthose who were the peculiar treasures of his heart, knew him as no\r\nothers could. Happy is the minister who forgets not his parish at\r\nhome--the church that is in his own house--and happy is the public man,\r\nwhose private life is not simply the revelation of the hard, coarse and\r\nunattractive side of his character.\r\n\r\nThat is I am sure no ordinary occurrence, which has made forever\r\nmemorable the Calends of this November. Death, however frequent and\r\nfamiliar by frequency, can never, to the thoughtful, be an event\r\nof common magnitude; the exchange of worlds cannot be other than\r\na most august experience. But this death has about it colossal\r\nproportions; it stands out and apart like a mountain in a landscape.\r\nIt is recognized as a calamity not only to a household, but to the\r\ncity, the State, the Nation; and it may be doubted whether, since\r\nthe assassination of Abraham Lincoln, any single announcement has so\r\nstartled the public mind and moved the popular heart as when on the\r\n1st day of November it was announced that Zachariah Chandler was found\r\nsleeping his last sleep.\r\n\r\nUlysses S. Grant is a man of few words--and like his shot and shell\r\nthey weigh a good deal and are well aimed. Let us hear his verdict on\r\nMr. Chandler:\r\n\r\n  \"A nation, as well as the State of Michigan, mourns the loss of one\r\n  of her most brave, patriotic and truest citizens. Senator Chandler\r\n  was beloved by his associates and respected by those who disagreed\r\n  with his political views. The more closely I became connected with\r\n  him the more I appreciated his great merits.\r\n\r\n                                                            U. S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n  \"GALENA, Ill., Nov. 9, 1879.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that it is no ordinary man who has departed from among\r\nus. It is not \"a self-evident truth that all men are created equal,\"\r\nif we mean equality of gifts and graces, capacity, opportunity or even\r\nresponsibility; and the people of these United States do not need to be\r\ntold that Mr. Chandler was no common man. It was by no accident that he\r\nheld in succession, and filled with success, posts of such importance\r\nand trusts of such magnitude. He did not drift into prominence; he\r\nrose by sheer force of character and by the fitness of things. Born\r\nto be a leader, endowed with those qualities that mark a man destined\r\nto leadership, having rare business faculty, and sagacity, tact and\r\ntalent, large capacity for organization and administration, his hand\r\nwas naturally at the helm.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler's leadership reached beyond and beneath the visible\r\nconduct of affairs. As Moses was the inspiration, of which Aaron was\r\nthe expression, he was often the power behind the throne. He who has\r\nnow left us, forever, belonged to the illustrious few who were the\r\nspecial counselors of Mr. Lincoln and the instigators of many of his\r\nwisest and best measures. There is an inner history of the war which\r\nhas never been written and never will be. The lips that alone could\r\ndisclose those secrets are fast closing in eternal silence, and the\r\nscroll will find no man worthy to loose its seals.\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler could not have been wholly ignorant of the risk he ran in\r\nhis laborious and prolonged campaign-work; but when his country seemed\r\nin peril his tongue could not keep silence. Just before starting on his\r\nlast journey westward, he said to me: \"In my judgment the crisis now\r\nupon us is more important than any since Lee surrendered, and as grave\r\nas any since Sumter was fired on.\" Those who knew him best will not be\r\nsurprised that, with such an impression of the magnitude of the issues\r\nnow before the American people, he could not spare himself, but gave\r\nhimself without reserve to his country, sacrificing his life itself on\r\nthe altar of his own patriotism.\r\n\r\nAnd so our stalwart statesman has fallen, and we have a new lesson on\r\nhuman mortality. Anaxagoras, when told that the Athenians had condemned\r\nhim to die, calmly added, \"And nature, them!\" All our riches, honors,\r\ndignities cannot stay the steps of the great destroyer. The manliest\r\nand mightiest leaders, and the humblest and meanest followers bow alike\r\nto the awful mandate of death. And as Massilon said at the funeral of\r\nthe Grand Monarch, \"God only is great!\"\r\n\r\nOf how little consequence after all are all the things that perish.\r\nTemporal things derive all their true value from their connection with\r\nthe invisible and eternal. How small will all appear as they recede\r\ninto the dim distance at the dying hour and the world to come confronts\r\nus with its awful decisions of destiny! What grandeur and glory are\r\nimparted to our humblest sphere of service, here, when touched and\r\ntransformed by the power of an endless life!\r\n\r\nWe have reason to be glad that the popular recognition of Mr.\r\nChandler's abilities and services has been so prompt and hearty as to\r\nafford him not a little satisfaction. Posthumous tributes are sometimes\r\nmelancholy memorials, reminding us of the monumental sepulchres of\r\nmartyr-prophets.\r\n\r\nRobert Burns's mother said about his monument, as she bitterly\r\nremembered how the poet of Ayr had been left to starve, \"Ah, Robbie, ye\r\nasked them for bread and they hae ge'en ye a stane!\" It can never be\r\nsaid that our departed Senator had to wait for another generation to\r\npronounce a just or generous verdict upon his career; the trophies of\r\nvictory and of popular esteem were strewn along the whole line of his\r\nmarch; and his last tour of the Northwest was a perpetual ovation.\r\n\r\nThere is to my mind no little inspiration of comfort in the fact that\r\nnot even human malice can falsify history. Men sometimes get more\r\nthan their share of praise or of blame while they live; but sooner or\r\nlater the cloud of incense or the mist of prejudice clears away and\r\nthe real character is more plainly seen. We can afford to leave the\r\nfinal verdict to another generation if need be, grateful as it is to be\r\nappreciated by the generation which we seek to serve.\r\n\r\nBut it is still more inspiring to know that God rules this world, and\r\nreigns over the affairs of men. If He marks the flight and the fall of\r\nthe sparrow, we may be sure that no man rises to the seat of power or\r\nsinks to the grave without His permission.\r\n\r\nGod is not dead, and cannot die. Generations pass away while He remains\r\nthe same. His hand is on the helm, whatever human hand seems to have\r\nhold, and is still there when the most trusted helmsman relaxes his\r\ndying grasp. If God's hand is not in our history, all its records are\r\nmisleading, and all its course a mystery. Admit the divine factor,\r\nand, from the strange unveiling of this hidden Western world until\r\nthis day, our national life appears like one colossal crystal; it has\r\nunity, transparency and symmetry. We can understand Plymouth Rock, the\r\nrevolution, the French and Indian wars, the war of 1812, the great\r\nrebellion, the Kansas problem and the California problem, the Indian\r\nquestion and the Chinese question, Romanism and Communism, Eastern\r\nconservatism and Western radicalism, the freedmen and the emigrant,\r\nstate rights and national sovereignty--all are the subordinate factors\r\nwhose harmonizing, reconciling, assimilating factor is the divine\r\npurpose and plan in our history. My friends, the republic has a divine\r\ndestiny to fulfill. The Great Pilot is steering the ship of state for\r\nher true haven. Scylla threatens on one side, Charbydis on the other;\r\nbut He knows the channel. The stormy Euroclydon may strike her, tear\r\nher sails to tatters and snap her ropes like burnt tow, and splinter\r\nher masts to fragments; but He holds the winds in his fists. Let us not\r\nfear. We have only to love, trust and obey the God of our Fathers and\r\nHe will guide us safely and surely through all darkness and danger.\r\nThe sins that reproach our people are the only foes we have to fear;\r\nthe righteousness that exalts a nation the only ally we need to covet.\r\nIf the people of Michigan would rear a grand monument to the heroic\r\nmen who have adorned our history, let us be true to the principles\r\nwhich they have defended, and to the God who gave them to us as His\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nThe DORIC PILLAR OF MICHIGAN has fallen; but the State stands, and\r\nGod can set another pillar in its place. There is stone in the\r\nquarry--columns are taking shape to-day in our homes and schools and\r\nchurches; and in God's time they shall be raised to their place. Let us\r\nonly be sure that in the shrine of our nation God finds a throne, and\r\nnot the idols of this world, and not even the earthquake shock shall\r\nshatter the symmetric structure of the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n  Silently corrected simple spelling, grammar, and typographical\r\n  errors.\r\n\r\n  Retained anachronistic and non-standard spellings as printed.\r\n\r\n  Enclosed italics font in _underscores_.\r\n\r\n  Enclosed bold font in =equals=.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Zachariah Chandler, by Detroit Post and Tribune",
