Years before, it had been foretold, and\r\nnow it was to happen. Years before, it had been declared, by competent\r\nauthority, that among the implications of the Constitution was that of\r\nthe power of the General Government to Emancipate the Slaves, as a War\r\nmeasure.  Hence, in thus commencing the War of the Rebellion, the South\r\nmarched with open eyes upon this, as among other of the legitimate and\r\nlogical results of such a War.\r\n\r\nPatrick Henry, in opposing the ratification by Virginia of the Federal\r\nConstitution, had declared to the Slaveholders of that State that \"Among\r\nten thousand implied powers\" which Congress may assume, \"they may, if we\r\nbe engaged in War, liberate every one of your Slaves, if they please, *\r\n* * Have they not power to provide for the General Defense and Welfare?\r\nMay they not think that these call for the abolition of Slavery?  May\r\nthey not pronounce all Slaves Free? and will they not be warranted by\r\nthat power?  * * *  They have the power, in clear, unequivocal terms,\r\nand will clearly and certainly exercise it.\"\r\n\r\nSo, too, in his great speech of May 25, 1836, in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, John Quincy Adams had declared that in \"the last great\r\nconflict which must be fought between Slavery and Emancipation,\"\r\nCongress \"must and will interfere\" with Slavery, \"and they will not only\r\npossess the Constitutional power so to interfere, but they will be bound\r\nin duty to do it, by the express provisions of the Constitution itself.\"\r\nAnd he followed this declaration with the equally emphatic words: \"From\r\nthe instant that your Slave-holding States become the theatre of War\r\n--civil, servile, or foreign--from that instant, the War powers of\r\nCongress extend to interference with the Institution of Slavery in every\r\nWay by which it can be interfered with.\"\r\n\r\nThe position thus announced by these expounders of the Constitution--the\r\none from Virginia, the other from Massachusetts--was not to be shaken\r\neven by the unanimous adoption, February 11, 1861, by the House of\r\nRepresentatives on roll call, of the resolution of Mr. Sherman, of Ohio,\r\nin these words:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That neither the Congress of the United States nor the people\r\nor governments of the non-Slaveholding States have the Constitutional\r\nright to legislate upon or interfere with Slavery in any of the\r\nSlaveholding States in the Union.\"\r\n\r\nEx-President J. Q. Adams's cogent exposition of the Constitution,\r\ntwenty-five years before, in that same House, demonstrating not only\r\nthat Congress had the right but the Constitutional power to so\r\ninterfere--and his further demonstration April 15, 1842, of his\r\nstatement that under the laws of War, \"when a Country is invaded, and\r\ntwo hostile armies are set in martial array, the Commanders of both\r\nArmies have power to Emancipate all the Slaves in the invaded\r\nterritory\"--as not to be overcome by a mere vote of one House, however\r\nunanimous.  For the time being, however, it contributed, with other\r\ncircumstances, to confuse the public mind and conscience.  Indeed as\r\nearly as May of 1861, the attitude of our Government and its troops\r\ntoward Negro Slaves owned or used by Rebels in rebellious States, began\r\nto perturb the public, bother the Administration, and worry the Military\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in Major-General McClellan's proclamation to the Union men\r\nof West Virginia, issued May 26, 1861, he said:\r\n\r\n\"The General Government cannot close its ears to the demand you have\r\nmade for assistance.  I have ordered troops to cross the river.  They\r\ncome as your friends and brothers--as enemies only to armed Rebels, who\r\nare preying upon you; your homes, your families, and your property are\r\nsafe under our protection.  All your rights shall be religiously\r\nrespected, notwithstanding all that has been said by the Traitors to\r\ninduce you to believe our advent among you will be signalized by an\r\ninterference with your Slaves.  Understand one thing clearly: not only\r\nwill we abstain from all such interference, but we will, on the\r\ncontrary, with an iron hand crush any attempt at insurrection on their\r\npart.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the very next day, May 27, 1861, Major-General\r\nButler, in command of the \"Department of  A Virginia,\" wrote to\r\nLieutenant-General Scott as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Since I wrote my last dispatch the question in regard to Slave property\r\nis becoming one of very serious magnitude.  The inhabitants of Virginia\r\nare using their Negroes in the batteries, and are preparing to send the\r\nwomen and children South.  The escapes from them are very numerous, and\r\na squad has come in this morning to my pickets bringing their women and\r\nchildren.  Of course these cannot be dealt with upon the theory on which\r\nI designed to treat the services of able-bodied men and women who might\r\ncome within my lines, and of which I gave you a detailed account in my\r\nlast dispatch.  I am in the utmost doubt what to do with this species of\r\nProperty.\r\n\r\n\"Up to this time I have had come within my lines men and women with\r\ntheir children, entire families, each family belonging to the same\r\nowner.  I have, therefore, determined to employ, as I can do very\r\nprofitably, the able-bodied persons in the party, issuing proper food\r\nfor the support of all, and charging against their services the expense\r\nof care and sustenance of the non-laborers, keeping a strict and\r\naccurate account as well of the services as of the expenditure, having\r\nthe worth of the services, and the cost of the expenditure, determined\r\nby a Board of Survey, to be hereafter detailed.  I know of no other\r\nmanner in which to dispose of this subject and the questions connected\r\ntherewith.\r\n\r\n\"As a matter of Property to the Insurgents, it will be of very great\r\nmoment, the number that I now have amounting, as I am informed, to what,\r\nin good times, would be of the value of sixty thousand dollars.  Twelve\r\nof these Negroes, I am informed, have escaped from the batteries on\r\nSewall's Point, which, this morning, fired upon my expedition as it\r\npassed by out of range.  As a means of offense, therefore, in the\r\nEnemy's hands, these Negroes, when able-bodied, are of the last\r\nimportance.  Without them the batteries could not have been erected, at\r\nleast for many weeks.\r\n\r\n\"As a Military question it would seem to be a measure of necessity to\r\ndeprive their masters of their services.  How can this be done?  As a\r\npolitical question and a question of humanity, can I receive the\r\nservices of a father and mother, and not take the children?  Of the\r\nhumanitarian aspect I have no doubt.  Of the political one I have no\r\nright to judge.  I therefore submit all this to your better judgment,\r\nand as the questions have a political aspect, I have ventured, and I\r\ntrust I am not wrong in so doing, to duplicate the parts of my dispatch\r\nrelating to this subject, and forward them to the Secretary of War.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply to the duplicate copy of this letter received by him, Secretary\r\nCameron thus answered:\r\n\r\n                         \"WASHINGTON, May 30, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"SIR: Your action in respect to the Negroes who came within your lines\r\nfrom the service of the Rebels is approved.  The Department is sensible\r\nof the embarrassments which must surround officers conducting Military\r\noperations in a State by the laws of which Slavery is sanctioned.\r\n\r\n\"The Government cannot recognize the rejection by any State of the\r\nFederal obligations, nor can it refuse the performance of the Federal\r\nobligations resting upon itself.  Among these Federal obligations,\r\nhowever, none can be more important than that of suppressing and\r\ndispersing armed combinations formed for the purpose of overthrowing its\r\nwhole Constitutional authority.\r\n\r\n\"While, therefore, you will permit no interference by the persons under\r\nyour command, with the relations of Persons held to Service under the\r\nlaws of any State, you will, on the other hand, so long as any State,\r\nwithin which your Military operations are conducted, is under the\r\ncontrol of such armed combinations, refrain from surrendering to alleged\r\nmasters any Person who may come within your lines.\r\n\r\n\"You will employ such Persons in the services to which they may be best\r\nadapted, keeping an account of the labor by them performed, of the value\r\nof it, and the expenses of their maintenance.  The question of their\r\nfinal disposition will be reserved for future determination.\r\n\r\n                              \"SIMON CAMERON,\r\n                              \"Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\"To Major General BUTLER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat tenderness, however, was exhibited by many of the Union Generals\r\nfor the doomed Institution.  On June 3, 1861, from Chambersburg, Pa., a\r\nproclamation signed \"By order of Major General Patterson, F. J. Porter,\r\nAsst.  Adj. General,\" was issued from \"Headquarters Department of\r\nPennsylvania,\" \"To the United States troops of this Department,\" in\r\nwhich they are admonished \"that, in the coming campaign in Virginia,\r\nwhile it is your duty to punish Sedition, you must protect the Loyal,\r\nand, should the occasion offer, at once suppress Servile Insurrection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"General Orders No. 33,\" issued from \"Headquarters Department of\r\nWashington,\" July 17, 1861, \"By command of Brigadier General Mansfield,\r\nTheo. Talbot, Assistant Adjutant General,\" were to this effect:\r\n\"Fugitive Slaves will under no pretext whatever, be permitted to reside,\r\nor be in any way harbored, in the quarters or camps of the troops\r\nserving in this Department.  Neither will such Slaves be allowed to\r\naccompany troops on the march.  Commanders of troops will be held\r\nresponsible for a strict observance of this order.\"  And early in August\r\na Military order was issued at Washington \"that no Negroes, without\r\nsufficient evidence of their being Free or of their right to travel, are\r\npermitted to leave the city upon the cars.\"\r\n\r\nBut Bull Run did much to settle the Military as well as public mind in\r\nproper grooves on this subject.\r\n\r\nBesides employing Negro Slaves to aid Rebellion, by the digging of\r\nditches, the throwing up of intrenchments, and the erection of\r\nbatteries, their Rebel masters placed in their hands arms with which to\r\nshoot down Union soldiers at the Battle of Bull Run, which, as we have\r\nseen, occurred on Sunday, July 21, 1861--and resulted in a check to the\r\nUnion Cause.\r\n\r\nThe terror and confusion and excitement already referred to, that\r\nprevailed in Washington all that night and the next day, as the\r\npanic-stricken crowd of soldiers and civilians poured over the Long\r\nBridge, footsore with running, faint with weariness, weak with hunger,\r\nand parched with thirst and the dust of the rout, can hardly be\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nBut, however panicky the general condition of the inhabitants of the\r\nNational Capital, the Congress bravely maintained its equanimity.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate, on the day following the disaster, a bill  touching the\r\nConfiscation of Property used for insurrectionary purposes being up for\r\nconsideration, the following amendment was offered to it:\r\n\r\n\"And be it further enacted, That whenever any person claiming to be\r\nentitled to the Service or Labor of any other Person under the laws of\r\nany State, shall employ such Person in aiding or promoting any\r\nInsurrection, or in resisting the Laws of the United States, or shall\r\npermit him to be so employed, he shall forfeit all right to such Service\r\nor Labor, and the Person whose Labor or Service is thus claimed shall be\r\nthenceforth discharged therefrom, any law to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding.\"\r\n\r\nThis amendment, emancipating Slaves employed by their masters to aid\r\nRebellion, was adopted by 33 yeas to 6 nays.\r\n\r\nAs showing the feeling expressed right upon the very heels of what\r\nseemed to be a great disaster, and when rumor, at any rate, placed the\r\nvictorious Enemy at the very gates of the Capital City, a few lines from\r\nthe debate may be interesting.\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull said: \"I am glad the yeas and nays have been called to let\r\nus see who is willing to vote that the Traitorous owner of a Negro shall\r\nemploy him to shoot down the Union men of the Country, and yet insist\r\nupon restoring him to the Traitor that owns him.  I understand that\r\nNegroes were in the fight which has recently occurred.  I take it that\r\nNegroes who are used to destroy the Union, and to shoot down the Union\r\nmen by the consent of Traitorous masters, ought not to be restored to\r\nthem.  If the Senator from Kentucky is in favor of restoring them, let\r\nhim vote against the amendment.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Wilson, of Massachusetts, said: \"I shall vote with more heart\r\nthan I vote for ordinary measures, for this proposition.  I hope the\r\nSenate and the House of Representatives will sustain it, and that this\r\nGovernment will carry it out with an inflexibility that knows no change.\r\nThe idea that men who are in arms destroying their Country shall be\r\npermitted to use others for that purpose, and that we shall stand by and\r\nissue orders to our Commanders, that we should disgrace our Cause and\r\nour Country, by returning such men to their Traitorous masters, ought\r\nnot longer to be entertained.  The time has come for that to cease; and,\r\nby the blessing of God, so far as I am concerned, I mean it shall cease.\r\n\r\n\"If there is anybody in this Chamber that chooses to take the other\r\npath, let him do it; let him know what our purpose is.  Our purpose is\r\nto save this Government and save this Country, and to put down Treason;\r\nand if Traitors use bondsmen to destroy this Country, my doctrine is\r\nthat the Government shall at once convert these bondsmen into men that\r\ncannot be used to destroy our Country.  I have no apologies to make for\r\nthis position, I take it proudly.\r\n\r\n\"I think the time has come when this Government, and the men who are in\r\narms under the Government, should cease to return to Traitors their\r\nFugitive Slaves, whom they are using to erect batteries to murder brave\r\nmen who are fighting under the flag of their Country.  The time has come\r\nwhen we should deal with the men who are organizing Negro companies, and\r\nteaching them to shoot down loyal men for the only offence of upholding\r\nthe flag of their Country.\r\n\r\n\"I hope further, Sir, that there is a public sentiment in this Country\r\nthat will blast men who will rise, in the Senate or out it, to make\r\napologies for Treason, or to defend or to maintain the doctrine that\r\nthis Government is bound to protect Traitors in converting their Slaves\r\ninto tools for the destruction of the Republic.\"\r\n\r\nSenator McDougall, of California, said: \"I regard this as a Confiscation\r\nfor Treason, and I am for the proposition.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ten Eyck, said: \"No longer ago than Saturday last I voted in the\r\nJudiciary Committee against this amendment, for two reasons: First, I\r\ndid not believe that persons in Rebellion against this Government would\r\nmake use of such means as the employment of Persons held to Labor or\r\nService, in their Armies; secondly, because I did not know what was to\r\nbecome of these poor wretches if they were discharged.  God knows we do\r\nnot want them in our Section of the Union.  But, Sir, having learned and\r\nbelieving that these persons have been employed with arms in their hands\r\nto shed the blood of the Union-loving men of this Country, I shall now\r\nvote in favor of that amendment with less regard to what may become of\r\nthese people than I had on Saturday.  I will merely instance that there\r\nis a precedent for this.  If I recollect history aright, General\r\nJackson, in the Seminole War, declared that every Slave who was taken in\r\narms against the United States should be set Free,\"\r\n\r\nSo, too, in the House of Representatives, the retrograde of a badly\r\ndemoralized Army, its routed fragments still coming in with alarming\r\nstories of a pursuing Enemy almost at the gates of the city, had no\r\nterrors for our legislators; and there was something of Roman dignity,\r\npatriotism, and courage, in the adoption, on that painfully memorable\r\nBlue Monday, (the first--[Offered by Mr. Crittenden, of Kentucky]--with\r\nonly two dissenting votes, on a yea and nay vote; and, the second\r\n--[Offered by Mr. Vandever, of Iowa.]--with entire unanimity) of the\r\nfollowing Resolutions:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United\r\nStates, That the present deplorable Civil War has been forced upon the\r\nCountry by the Disunionists of the Southern States, now in arms against\r\nthe Constitutional Government, and in arms around the Capital; that in\r\nthis National emergency, Congress, banishing all feelings of mere\r\npassion or resentment, will recollect only its duty to the whole\r\nCountry; that this War is not waged on their part in any spirit of\r\noppression, or for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, or purpose of\r\noverthrowing or interfering with the rights or established Institutions\r\nof those States, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the\r\nConstitution, and to preserve the Union with all the dignity, equality,\r\nand rights of the several States unimpaired; and that as soon as these\r\nobjects are accomplished, the War ought to cease.\"\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the maintenance of the Constitution, the preservation of\r\nthe Union, and the enforcement of the Laws, are sacred trusts which must\r\nbe executed; that no disaster shall discourage us from the most ample\r\nperformance of this high duty; and that we pledge to the Country and the\r\nWorld, the employment of every resource, National and individual, for\r\nthe suppression, overthrow, and punishment of Rebels in arms.\"\r\n\r\nThe first of these Resolutions was intended to calm the fears of the\r\nBorder States--excited by Rebel emissaries; the second, to restore\r\nconfidence and courage to the patriot hearts of Union-men, everywhere.\r\nBoth were effectual.\r\n\r\nAnd here it will hardly be amiss to glance, for an instant, toward the\r\nSenate Chamber; and especially at one characteristic incident.  It was\r\nthe afternoon of August the 1st, 1861,--scarce ten days since the check\r\nto the Union arms at Bull Run; and Breckinridge, of Kentucky, not yet\r\nexpelled from the United States Senate, was making in that Body his\r\ngreat speech against the \"Insurrection and Sedition Bill,\" and upon \"the\r\nsanctity of the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nBaker, of Oregon,--who, as Sumner afterward said: \"with a zeal that\r\nnever tired, after recruiting men drawn by the attraction of his name,\r\nin New York and Philadelphia and elsewhere, held his Brigade in camp,\r\nnear the Capitol, so that he passed easily from one to the other, and\r\nthus alternated the duties of a Senator and a General,\" having reached\r\nthe Capitol, direct from his Brigade-camp, entered the Senate Chamber,\r\nin his uniform, while Breckinridge was speaking.\r\n\r\nWhen the Kentucky Senator \"with Treason in his heart, if not on his\r\nlips,\" resumed his seat, the gray-haired soldier-Senator at once rose to\r\nreply.  \"He began,\"--said Charles Sumner, in alluding to the incident\r\n--\"simply and calmly; but as he proceeded, his fervid soul broke forth in\r\nwords of surpassing power.  As on a former occasion he had presented the\r\nwell-ripened fruits of study, so now he spoke with the spontaneous\r\nutterance of his own mature and exuberant eloquence--meeting the\r\npolished Traitor at every point with weapons keener and brighter than\r\nhis own.\"\r\n\r\nAfter demolishing Breckinridge's position touching the alleged\r\nUnconstitutionality of the measure, and characterizing his other\r\nutterances as \"reproof, malediction, and prediction combined,\" the\r\nPatriot from the Far-West turned with rising voice and flashing eye upon\r\nthe gloomy Kentuckian:\r\n\r\n\"I would ask him,\" said he, \"what would you have us do now--a\r\nConfederate Army within twenty miles of us, advancing, or threatening to\r\nadvance, to overwhelm your Government; to shake the pillars of the\r\nUnion, to bring it around your head, if you stay here, in ruins?  Are we\r\nto stop and talk about an uprising sentiment in the North against the\r\nWar?  Are we to predict evil, and retire from what we predict?  Is it\r\nnot the manly part to go on as we have begun, to raise money, and levy\r\nArmies, to organize them, to prepare to advance; when we do advance, to\r\nregulate that advance by all the laws and regulations that civilization\r\nand humanity will allow in time of battle?  Can we do anything more?  To\r\ntalk to us about stopping, is idle; we will never stop.  Will the\r\nSenator yield to Rebellion?  Will he shrink from armed Insurrection?\r\nWill his State justify it?  Will its better public opinion allow it?\r\nShall we send a flag of Truce?  What would he have?  Or would he conduct\r\nthis War so feebly, that the whole World would smile at us in derision?\"\r\n\r\nAnd then cried the orator-his voice rising to a higher key, penetrating,\r\nyet musical as the blast from a silver trumpet: \"What would he have?\r\nThese speeches of his, sown broadcast over the Land, what clear distinct\r\nmeaning have they?  Are they not intended for disorganization in our\r\nvery midst?  Are they not intended to dull our weapons?  Are they not\r\nintended to destroy our zeal?  Are they not intended to animate our\r\nenemies?  Sir, are they not words of brilliant, polished Treason, even\r\nin the very Capitol of the Nation?\r\n\r\n\"What would have been thought, if, in another Capitol, in another\r\nRepublic, in a yet more martial age, a Senator as grave, not more\r\neloquent or dignified than the Senator from Kentucky, yet with the Roman\r\npurple flowing over his shoulder, had risen in his place, surrounded by\r\nall the illustrations of Roman glory, and declared that the cause of\r\nadvancing Hannibal was just, and that Carthage ought to be dealt with in\r\nterms of peace?  What would have been thought if, after the battle of\r\nCannae, a Senator there had risen in his place and denounced every levy\r\nof the Roman People, every expenditure of its treasure, and every appeal\r\nto the old recollections and the old glories?\"\r\n\r\nThe speaker paused.  The sudden and intent silence was broken by another\r\nvoice: \"He would have been hurled from the Tarpeian rock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" continued the soldier-orator, \"a Senator, himself learned far\r\nmore than myself in such lore, [Mr. Fessenden,] tells me, in a voice\r\nthat I am glad is audible, that he would have been hurled from the\r\nTarpeian Rock!  It is a grand commentary upon the American Constitution\r\nthat we permit these words [Senator Breckinridge's] to be uttered.\r\n\r\n\"I ask the Senator to recollect, too, what, save to send aid and comfort\r\nto the Enemy, do these predictions of his amount to?  Every word thus\r\nuttered falls as a note of inspiration upon every Confederate ear.\r\nEvery sound thus uttered is a word, (and, falling from his lips, a\r\nmighty word) of kindling and triumph to a Foe that determines to\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\n\"For me, I have no such word as a Senator, to utter.  For me\"--and here\r\nhis eyes flashed again while his martial voice rang like a clarion-call\r\nto battle--\"amid temporary defeat, disaster, disgrace, it seems that my\r\nduty calls me to utter another word, and that word is, bold, sudden,\r\nforward, determined, WAR, according to the laws of War, by Armies, by\r\nMilitary Commanders clothed with full power, advancing with all the past\r\nglories of the Republic urging them on to conquest!\r\n\r\n                     *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n\"I tell the Senator,\" continued the inspired Patriot, \"that his\r\npredictions, sometimes for the South, sometimes for the Middle States,\r\nsometimes for the North-East, and then wandering away in airy visions\r\nout to the Far Pacific, about the dread of our people, as for loss of\r\nblood and treasure, provoking them to Disloyalty, are false in\r\nsentiment, false in fact, and false in Loyalty.  The Senator from\r\nKentucky is mistaken in them all.\r\n\r\n\"Five hundred million dollars!  What then?  Great Britain gave more than\r\ntwo thousand million in the great Battle for Constitutional Liberty\r\nwhich she led at one time almost single-handed against the World.  Five\r\nhundred thousand men!  What then?  We have them; they are ours; they are\r\nthe children of the Country; they belong to the whole Country; they are\r\nour sons; our kinsmen; and there are many of us who will give them all\r\nup before we will abate one word of our just demand, or will retreat one\r\ninch from the line which divides right from wrong.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, it is not a question of men or of money in that sense.  All the\r\nmoney, all the men, are, in our judgment, well bestowed in such a cause.\r\nWhen we give them, we know their value.  Knowing their value well, we\r\ngive them with the more pride and the, more joy.  Sir, how can we\r\nretreat?  Sir, how can we make Peace?  Who shall treat?  What\r\nCommissioners?  Who would go?  Upon what terms?  Where is to be your\r\nboundary line?  Where the end of the principles we shall have to give\r\nup?  What will become of Constitutional Government?  What will become of\r\npublic Liberty?  What of past glories?  What of future hopes?\r\n\r\n\"Shall we sink into the insignificance of the grave--a degraded,\r\ndefeated, emasculated People, frightened by the results of one battle,\r\nand scared at the visions raised by the imagination of the Senator from\r\nKentucky on this floor?  No, Sir! a thousand times, no, Sir!  We will\r\nrally--if, indeed, our words be necessary--we will rally the People, the\r\nLoyal People, of the whole Country.  They will pour forth their\r\ntreasure, their money, their men, without stint, without measure.  The\r\nmost peaceable man in this body may stamp his foot upon this Senate\r\nChamber floor, as of old a warrior and a Senator did, and from that\r\nsingle tramp there will spring forth armed Legions.\r\n\r\n\"Shall one battle determine the fate of empire, or a dozen?--the loss of\r\none thousand men, or twenty thousand?  or one hundred million or five\r\nhundred million dollars?  In a year's Peace--in ten years, at most, of\r\npeaceful progress--we can restore them all.  There will be some graves\r\nreeking with blood, watered by the tears of affection.  There will be\r\nsome privation; there will be some loss of luxury; there will be\r\nsomewhat more need for labor to procure the necessaries of life.  When\r\nthat is said, all is said.  If we have the Country, the whole Country,\r\nthe Union, the Constitution, Free Government--with these there will\r\nreturn all the blessings of well-ordered civilization; the path of the\r\nCountry will be a career of greatness and of glory such as, in the olden\r\ntime, our Fathers saw in the dim visions of years yet to come, and such\r\nas would have been ours now, to-day, if it had not been for the Treason\r\nfor which the Senator too often seeks to apologize.\"\r\n\r\nThis remarkable speech was the last utterance of that glorious and\r\ncourageous soul, in the National Senate.  Within three months, his\r\nlifeless body, riddled by Rebel rifle balls, was borne away from the\r\nfatal field of Ball's Bluff--away, amid the lamentations of a Nation\r\n--away, across land and ocean--to lie beside his brave friend Broderick,\r\non that Lone Mountain whose solemn front looks out upon the calm\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nHe had not lived in vain.  In his great speech at the American Theatre\r\nin San Francisco, after his election by Oregon (1860) to represent her\r\nin the United States Senate, he had aroused the people to a sense of\r\nshame, that, as he said: \"Here, in a land of written Constitutional\r\nLiberty it is reserved for us to teach the World that, under the\r\nAmerican Stars and Stripes, Slavery marches in solemn procession; that,\r\nunder the American flag, Slavery is protected to the utmost verge of\r\nacquired territory; that under the American banner, the name of Freedom\r\nis to be faintly heard, the songs of Freedom faintly sung; that, while\r\nGaribaldi, Victor Emanuel, every great and good man in the World,\r\nstrives, struggles, fights, prays, suffers and dies, sometimes on the\r\nscaffold, sometimes in the dungeon, often on the field of battle,\r\nrendered immortal by his blood and his valor; that, while this triumphal\r\nprocession marches on through the arches of Freedom--we, in this land,\r\nof all the World, shrink back trembling when Freedom is but mentioned!\"\r\n\r\nAnd never was a shamed people more suddenly lifted up from that shame\r\ninto a grand frenzy of patriotic devotion than were his auditors, when,\r\nwith the inspiration of his matchless genius, he continued:\r\n\r\n\"As for me, I dare not, will not, be false to Freedom.  Where the feet\r\nof my youth were planted, there, by Freedom, my feet shall ever stand.\r\nI will walk beneath her banner.  I will glory in her strength.  I have\r\nwatched her in history struck down on an hundred chosen fields of\r\nbattle.  I have seen her friends fly from her; her foes gather around\r\nher.  I have seen her bound to the stake; I have seen them give her\r\nashes to the winds.  But when they turned to exult, I have seen her\r\nagain meet them face to face, resplendent in complete steel, brandishing\r\nin her strong right hand a flaming sword, red with Insufferable light!\r\nI take courage.  The People gather around her.  The genius of America\r\nwill, at last, lead her sons to Freedom.\"\r\n\r\nNever were grander utterances delivered by man in all the ages; never\r\nwas there exhibited a more sublime faith; never a truer spirit of\r\nprophecy; never a more heroic spirit.\r\n\r\nHe was then on his way to Washington; on his way to perform the last\r\nacts in the drama of his own career--on his way to death.  He knew the\r\ntime had come, of which, ten years before, he had prophetically spoken\r\nin the House of Representatives, when he said: \"I have only to say that,\r\nif the time should come when Disunion rules the hour, and discord is to\r\nreign supreme, I shall again be ready to give the best blood in my veins\r\nto my Country's Cause.  I shall be prepared to meet all antagonists with\r\nlance in rest, to do battle in every land, in defense of the\r\nConstitution of the Country which I have sworn to support, to the last\r\nextremity, against Disunionists, and all its Enemies, whether of the\r\nSouth or North; to meet them everywhere, at all times, with speech or\r\nhand, with word or blow, until thought and being shall be no longer\r\nmine.\"  And right nobly did he fulfil in all respects his promise; so\r\nthat at the end--as was afterward well said of him by Mr. Colfax--he had\r\nmounted so high, that, \"doubly crowned, as statesman, and as warrior--\r\n\r\n     'From the top of Fame's ladder he stepped to the Sky!'\"\r\n\r\n     [This orator and hero was a naturalized Englishman, and commanded\r\n     an American regiment in the Mexican War.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n                         FREEDOM'S EARLY DAWN.\r\n\r\nOn the day following Baker's great reply to Breckinridge, another\r\nnotable speech was made, in the House of Representatives--notable,\r\nespecially, in that it foreshadowed Emancipation, and, coming so soon\r\nafter Bull Run, seemed to accentuate a new departure in political\r\nthought as an outgrowth of that Military reverse.  It was upon the\r\nConfiscation Act, and it was Thaddeus Stevens who made it.  Said he:\r\n\r\n\"If we are justified in taking property from the Enemy in War, when you\r\nhave rescued an oppressed People from the oppression of that Enemy, by\r\nwhat principle of the Law of Nations, by what principle of philanthropy,\r\ncan you return them to the bondage from which you have delivered them,\r\nand again rivet the chains you have once broken?  It is a disgrace to\r\nthe Party which advocates it.  It is against the principle of the Law of\r\nNations.  It is against every principle of philanthropy.  I for one,\r\nshall never shrink from saying when these Slaves are once conquered by\r\nus, 'Go and be Free.'  God forbid that I should ever agree that they\r\nshould be returned again to their masters!  I do not say that this War\r\nis made for that purpose.  Ask those who made the War, what is its\r\nobject.  Do not ask us.  * * *  Our object is to subdue the Rebels.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" continued he, \"it is said that if we hold out this thing, they\r\nwill never submit--that we cannot conquer them--that they will suffer\r\nthemselves to be slaughtered, and their whole country to be laid waste.\r\nSir, War is a grievous thing at best, and Civil War more than any other;\r\nbut if they hold this language, and the means which they have suggested\r\nmust be resorted to; if their whole country must be laid waste, and made\r\na desert, in order to save this Union from destruction, so let it be.  I\r\nwould rather, Sir, reduce them to a condition where their whole country\r\nis to be re-peopled by a band of freemen than to see them perpetrate the\r\ndestruction of this People through our agency.  I do not say that it is\r\ntime to resort to such means, and I do not know when the time will come;\r\nbut I never fear to express my sentiments.  It is not a question with me\r\nof policy, but a question of principle.\r\n\r\n\"If this War is continued long, and is bloody, I do not believe that the\r\nfree people of the North will stand by and see their sons and brothers\r\nand neighbors slaughtered by thousands and tens of thousands by Rebels,\r\nwith arms in their hands, and forbear to call upon their enemies to be\r\nour friends, and to help us in subduing them; I for one, if it continues\r\nlong, and has the consequences mentioned, shall be ready to go for it,\r\nlet it horrify the gentleman from New York (Mr. Diven) or anybody else.\r\nThat is my doctrine, and that will be the doctrine of the whole free\r\npeople of the North before two years roll round, if this War continues.\r\n\r\n\"As to the end of the War, until the Rebels are subdued, no man in the\r\nNorth thinks of it.  If the Government are equal to the People, and I\r\nbelieve they are, there will be no bargaining, there will be no\r\nnegotiation, there will be no truces with the Rebels, except to bury the\r\ndead, until every man shall have laid down his arms, disbanded his\r\norganization, submitted himself to the Government, and sued for mercy.\r\nAnd, Sir, if those who have the control of the Government are not fit\r\nfor this task and have not the nerve and mind for it, the People will\r\ntake care that there are others who are--although, Sir, I have not a bit\r\nof fear of the present Administration, or of the present Executive.\r\n\r\n\"I have spoken more freely, perhaps, than gentlemen within my hearing\r\nmight think politic, but I have spoken just what I felt.  I have spoken\r\nwhat I believe will be the result; and I warn Southern gentlemen, that\r\nif this War is to continue, there will be a time when my friend from New\r\nYork (Mr. Diven) will see it declared by this free Nation, that every\r\nbondman in the South--belonging to a Rebel, recollect; I confine it to\r\nthem--shall be called upon to aid us in War against their masters, and\r\nto restore this Union.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter of instruction from Secretary Cameron, touching the\r\nFugitive Slave question, dated seven days after Thaddeus Stevens'\r\nspeech, had also an interesting bearing on the subject:\r\n\r\n                         \"WASHINGTON, August 8, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL: The important question of the proper disposition to be made of\r\nFugitives from Service in States in Insurrection against the Federal\r\nGovernment, to which you have again directed my attention in your letter\r\nof July 30, has received my most attentive consideration.\r\n\r\n\"It is the desire of the President that all existing rights, in all the\r\nStates, be fully respected and maintained.  The War now prosecuted on\r\nthe part of the Federal Government is a War for the Union, and for the\r\npreservation of all Constitutional rights of States, and the citizens of\r\nthe States, in the Union.  Hence, no question can arise as to Fugitives\r\nfrom Service within the States and Territories in which the authority of\r\nthe Union is fully acknowledged.  The ordinary forms of Judicial\r\nproceeding, which must be respected by Military and Civil authorities\r\nalike, will suffice for the enforcement of all legal claims.\r\n\r\n\"But in States wholly or partially under Insurrectionary control, where\r\nthe Laws of the United States are so far opposed and resisted that they\r\ncannot be effectually enforced, it is obvious that rights dependent on\r\nthe execution of those laws must, temporarily, fail; and it is equally\r\nobvious that rights dependent on the laws of the States within which\r\nMilitary operations are conducted must be necessarily subordinated to\r\nthe Military exigences created by the Insurrection, if not wholly\r\nforfeited by the Treasonable conduct of parties claiming them.  To this\r\ngeneral rule, rights to Services can form no exception.\r\n\r\n\"The Act of Congress, approved August 6, 1861, declares that if Persons\r\nheld to Service shall be employed in hostility to the United States, the\r\nright to their services shall be forfeited, and such Persons shall be\r\ndischarged therefrom.  It follows, of necessity, that no claim can be\r\nrecognized by the Military authorities of the Union to the services of\r\nsuch Persons when fugitives.\r\n\r\n\"A more difficult question is presented in respect to Persons escaping\r\nfrom the Service of Loyal masters.  It is quite apparent that the laws\r\nof the State, under which only the services of such fugitives can be\r\nclaimed, must needs be wholly, or almost wholly, suspended, as to\r\nremedies, by the Insurrection and the Military measures necessitated by\r\nit.  And it is equally apparent that the substitution of Military for\r\nJudicial measures for the enforcement of such claims must be attended by\r\ngreat inconveniences, embarrassments, and injuries.\r\n\r\n\"Under these circumstances it seems quite clear that the substantial\r\nrights of Loyal masters will be best protected by receiving such\r\nfugitives, as well as fugitives from Disloyal masters, into the service\r\nof the United States, and employing them under such organizations and in\r\nsuch occupations as circumstances may suggest or require.\r\n\r\n\"Of course a record should be kept showing the name and description of\r\nthe fugitives, the name and the character, as Loyal or Disloyal, of the\r\nmaster, and such facts as may be necessary to a correct understanding of\r\nthe circumstances of each case after tranquillity shall have been\r\nrestored.  Upon the return of Peace, Congress will, doubtless, properly\r\nprovide for all the persons thus received into the service of the Union,\r\nand for just compensation to Loyal masters.  In this way only, it would\r\nseem, can the duty and safety of the Government and the just rights of\r\nall be fully reconciled and harmonized.\r\n\r\n\"You will therefore consider yourself as instructed to govern your\r\nfuture action, in respect to Fugitives from Service, by the principles\r\nhere stated, and will report from time to time, and at least twice in\r\neach month, your action in the premises to this Department.\r\n\r\n\"You will, however, neither authorize, nor permit any interference, by\r\nthe troops under your command, with the servants of peaceful citizens in\r\nhouse or field; nor will you, in any way, encourage such servants to\r\nleave the lawful Service of their masters; nor will you, except in cases\r\nwhere the Public Safety may seem to require, prevent the voluntary\r\nreturn of any Fugitive, to the Service from which he may have escaped.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am, General, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                              \"SIMON CAMERON,\r\n                              \"Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\"Major-General B. F. BUTLER,\r\n\"Commanding Department of Virginia,\r\n\"Fortress Monroe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether or not inspired by the prophetic speech of Thaddeus Stevens,\r\naforesaid, the month of August was hardly out before its prophecy seemed\r\nin a fair way of immediate fulfilment.  Major-General John Charles\r\nFremont at that time commanded the Eastern Department--comprising the\r\nStates of Missouri, Kansas, Illinois, and Kentucky-and he startled the\r\nCountry by issuing the following Emancipation proclamation:\r\n\r\n\r\n               \"HEADQUARTERS OF THE WESTERN DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n                    \"St. Louis, August 30, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"Circumstances, in my judgment, of sufficient urgency, render it\r\nnecessary that the commanding general of this Department should assume\r\nthe administrative powers of the State.  Its disorganized condition, the\r\nhelplessness of the civil authority, the total insecurity of life, and\r\nthe devastation of property by bands of murderers and marauders, who\r\ninfest nearly every county of the State, and avail themselves of the\r\npublic misfortunes and the vicinity of a hostile force to gratify\r\nprivate and neighborhood vengeance, and who find an enemy wherever they\r\nfind plunder, finally demand the severest measures to repress the daily\r\nincreasing crimes and outrages which are driving off the inhabitants and\r\nruining the State.\r\n\r\n\"In this condition, the public safety and the success of our arms\r\nrequire unity of purpose, without let or hinderance, to the prompt\r\nadministration of affairs.\r\n\r\n\"In order, therefore, to suppress disorder, to maintain as far as now\r\npracticable the public peace, and to give security and protection to the\r\npersons and property of loyal citizens, I do hereby extend and declare\r\nestablished Martial Law throughout the State of Missouri.\r\n\r\n\"The lines of the Army of Occupation in this State are for the present\r\ndeclared to extend from Leavenworth by way of the posts of Jefferson\r\nCity, Rolla, and Ironton, to Cape Girardeau, on the Mississippi river.\r\n\r\n\"All persons who shall betaken with arms in their hands within these\r\nlines shall be tried by Court-Martial, and if found guilty will be shot.\r\n\r\n\"The property, real and personal, of all persons, in the State of\r\nMissouri, who shall take up arms against the United States, or who shall\r\nbe directly proven to have taken an active part with their Enemies in\r\nthe field, is declared to be confiscated to the public use, and their\r\nSlaves, if any they have, are hereby declared Free men.\r\n\r\n\"All persons who shall be proven to have destroyed, after the\r\npublication of this order, railroad tracks, bridges, or telegraphs,\r\nshall suffer the extreme penalty of the law.\r\n\r\n\"All persons engaged in Treasonable correspondence, in giving or\r\nprocuring aid to the Enemies of the United States, in fomenting tumults,\r\nin disturbing the public tranquillity by creating and circulating false\r\nreports or incendiary documents, are in their own interests warned that\r\nthey are exposing themselves to sudden and severe punishment.\r\n\r\n\"All persons who have been led away from their allegiance, are required\r\nto return to their homes forthwith; any such absence, without sufficient\r\ncause, will be held to be presumptive evidence against them.\r\n\r\n\"The object of this declaration is to place in the hands of the Military\r\nauthorities the power to give instantaneous effect to existing laws, and\r\nto supply such deficiencies as the conditions of War demand.  But this\r\nis not intended to suspend the ordinary Tribunals of the Country, where\r\nthe Law will be administered by the Civil officers in the usual manner,\r\nand with their customary authority, while the same can be peaceably\r\nexercised.\r\n\r\n\"The commanding general will labor vigilantly for the public Welfare,\r\nand in his efforts for their safety hopes to obtain not only the\r\nacquiescence, but the active support of the Loyal People of the Country.\r\n\r\n                              \"J. C. FREMONT,\r\n                         \"Major-General Commanding.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFremont's Proclamation of Confiscation and Emancipation, was hailed with\r\njoy by some Patriots in the North, but was by others looked upon as rash\r\nand premature and inexpedient; while it bitterly stirred the anger of\r\nthe Rebels everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe Rebel Jeff. Thompson, then in command of the Rebel forces about St.\r\nLouis, at once issued the following savage proclamation of retaliation:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"HEADQUARTERS FIRST MILITARY DISTRICT, M. S. G.\r\n\r\n               'St. Louis, August 31, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"To all whom it may concern:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas Major-General John C.  Fremont, commanding the minions of\r\nAbraham Lincoln in the State of Missouri, has seen fit to declare\r\nMartial Law throughout the whole State, and has threatened to shoot any\r\ncitizen-soldier found in arms within certain limits; also, to Confiscate\r\nthe property and Free the Negroes belonging to the members of the\r\nMissouri State Guard:\r\n\r\n\"Therefore, know ye, that I, M. Jeff.  Thompson, Brigadier-General of\r\nthe First Military District of Missouri, having not only the Military\r\nauthority of Brigadier-General, but certain police powers granted by\r\nActing-Governor Thomas C. Reynolds, and confirmed afterward by Governor\r\nJackson, do most solemnly promise that for every member of the Missouri\r\nState Guard, or soldier of our allies, the Armies of the Confederate\r\nStates, who shall be put to death in pursuance of the said order of\r\nGeneral Fremont, I will hang, draw, and quarter a minion of said Abraham\r\nLincoln.\r\n\r\n\"While I am anxious that this unfortunate War shall be conducted, if\r\npossible, upon the most liberal principles of civilized warfare--and\r\nevery order that I have issued has been with that object--yet, if this\r\nrule is to be adopted (and it must first be done by our Enemies) I\r\nintend to exceed General Fremont in his excesses, and will make all\r\ntories that come within my reach rue the day that a different policy was\r\nadopted by their leaders.\r\n\r\n\"Already mills, barns, warehouses, and other private property have been\r\nwastefully and wantonly destroyed by the Enemy in this district, while\r\nwe have taken nothing except articles strictly contraband or absolutely\r\nnecessary.  Should these things be repeated, I will retaliate ten-fold,\r\nso help me God!\"\r\n\r\n                              \"M. JEFF. THOMPSON,\r\n                    \"Brigadier-General Commanding.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"President Lincoln, greatly embarrassed by the precipitate action of his\r\nsubordinate, lost no time in suggesting to General Fremont certain\r\nmodifications of his Emancipation proclamation-as follows:\r\n\r\n\"[PRIVATE.]\r\n               \"WASHINGTON, D.  C., September 2, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR: Two points in your proclamation of August 30th give me\r\nsome anxiety:\r\n\r\n\"First.  Should you shoot a man according to the proclamation, the\r\nConfederates would very certainly shoot our best man in their hands, in\r\nretaliation; and so, man for man, indefinitely.  It is, therefore, my\r\norder that you allow no man to be shot under the proclamation without\r\nfirst having my approbation or consent.\r\n\r\n\"Second.  I think there is great danger that the closing paragraph, in\r\nrelation to the Confiscation of Property, and the liberating Slaves of\r\nTraitorous owners, will alarm our Southern Union friends, and turn them\r\nagainst us; perhaps ruin our rather fair prospect for Kentucky.\r\n\r\n\"Allow me, therefore, to ask that you will, as of your own motion,\r\nmodify that paragraph so as to conform to the first and fourth sections\r\nof the Act of Congress entitled, 'An Act to Confiscate Property used for\r\nInsurrectionary purposes,' approved August 6, 1861, a copy of which Act\r\nI herewith send you.\r\n\r\n\"This letter is written in a spirit of caution, and not of censure.\r\n\r\n\"I send it by a special messenger, in that it may certainly and speedily\r\nreach you.\r\n                              \"Yours very truly,\r\n                              \"A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\"Major-General FREMONT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Fremont replied to President Lincoln's suggestions, as follows:\r\n\r\n                    \"HEADQUARTERS WESTERN DEPARTMENT,\r\n                    \"St.  Louis, September 8, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR: Your letter of the second, by special\r\nmessenger, I know to have been written before you had received my\r\nletter, and before my telegraphic dispatches and the rapid developments\r\nof critical conditions here had informed you of affairs in this quarter.\r\nI had not written to you fully and frequently, first, because in the\r\nincessant change of affairs I would be exposed to give you contradictory\r\naccounts; and., secondly, because the amount of the subjects to be laid\r\nbefore you would demand too much of your time.\r\n\r\n\"Trusting to have your confidence, I have been leaving it to events\r\nthemselves to show you whether or not I was shaping affairs here\r\naccording to your ideas.  The shortest communication between Washington\r\nand St. Louis generally involves two days, and the employment of two\r\ndays, in time of War, goes largely toward success or disaster.  I\r\ntherefore went along according to my own judgment, leaving the result of\r\nmy movement to justify me with you.\r\n\r\n\"And so in regard to my proclamation of the thirtieth.  Between the\r\nRebel Armies, the Provisional Government, and the home Traitors, I felt\r\nthe position bad, and saw danger.  In the night I decided upon the\r\nproclamation and the form of it--I wrote it the next morning and printed\r\nit the same day.  I did it without consultation or advice with any one,\r\nacting solely with my best judgment to serve the Country and yourself,\r\nand perfectly willing to receive the amount of censure which should be\r\nthought due, if I had made a false movement.\r\n\r\n\"This is as much a movement in the War, as a battle, and, in going into\r\nthese, I shall have to act according to my judgment of the ground before\r\nme, as I did on this occasion.  If upon reflection, your better judgment\r\nstill decides that I am wrong in the article respecting the Liberation\r\nof Slaves, I have to ask that you will openly direct me to make the\r\ncorrection.  The implied censure will be received as a soldier always\r\nshould the reprimand of his chief.\r\n\r\n\"If I were to retract of my own accord, it would imply that I myself\r\nthought it wrong, and that I had acted without the reflection which the\r\ngravity of the point demanded.  But I did not.  I acted with full\r\ndeliberation, and upon the certain conviction that it was a measure\r\nright and necessary, and I think so still.\r\n\r\n\"In regard to the other point of the proclamation to which you refer, I\r\ndesire to say that I do not think the Enemy can either misconstrue or\r\nurge anything against it, or undertake to make unusual retaliation.  The\r\nshooting of men who shall rise in arms against an Army in the Military\r\noccupation of a Country, is merely a necessary measure of defense, and\r\nentirely according to the usages of civilized warfare.  The article does\r\nnot at all refer to prisoners of war, and certainly our Enemies have no\r\ngrounds for requiring that we should waive in their benefit any of the\r\nordinary advantages which the usages of War allow to us.\r\n\r\n\"As promptitude is itself an advantage in War, I have also to ask that\r\nyou will permit me to carry out upon the spot the provisions of the\r\nproclamation in this respect.\r\n\r\n\"Looking at affairs from this point of view, I am satisfied that strong\r\nand vigorous measures have now become necessary to the success of our\r\nArms; and hoping that my views may have the honor to meet your approval,\r\n\r\n     \"I am, with respect and regard, very truly yours,\r\n                         \"J. C. FREMONT.\r\n\r\n\"THE PRESIDENT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln subsequently rejoined, ordering a modification of the\r\nproclamation.  His letter ran thus:\r\n\r\n\"WASHINGTON, September 11, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"SIR: Yours of the 8th, in answer to mine of the 2d instant, is just\r\nreceived.  Assuming that you, upon the ground, could better judge of the\r\nnecessities of your position than I could at this distance, on seeing\r\nyour Proclamation of August 30th, I perceived no general objection to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"The particular clause, however, in relation to the Confiscation of\r\nProperty and the Liberation of Slaves, appeared to me to be\r\nobjectionable in its non-conformity to the Act of Congress, passed the\r\n6th of last August, upon the same subjects; and hence I wrote you\r\nexpressing my wish that that clause should be modified accordingly.\r\n\r\n\"Your answer, just received, expresses the preference, on your part,\r\nthat I should make an open order for the modification, which I very\r\ncheerfully do.\r\n\r\n\"It is therefore Ordered, that the said clause of said proclamation be\r\nso modified, held, and construed as to conform to, and not to transcend,\r\nthe provisions on the same subject contained in the Act of Congress\r\nentitled, 'An Act to Confiscate Property used for Insurrectionary\r\nPurposes,' approved August 6, 1861, and that said Act be published at\r\nlength with this Order.\r\n\r\n                         \"Your obedient servant,\r\n                                   \"A.

You will, however, in general avail yourself\r\nof the services of any Persons, whether Fugitives from Labor or not, who\r\nmay offer them to the National Government; you will employ such Persons\r\nin such services as they may be fitted for, either as ordinary\r\nemployees, or, if special circumstances seem to require it, in any other\r\ncapacity with such organization, in squads, companies, or otherwise, as\r\nyou deem most beneficial to the service.  This, however, not to mean a\r\ngeneral arming of them for Military service.\r\n\r\n\"You will assure all Loyal masters that Congress will provide just\r\ncompensation to them for the loss of the services of the Persons so\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n\"It is believed that the course thus indicated will best secure the\r\nsubstantial rights of Loyal masters, and the benefits to the United\r\nStates of the services of all disposed to support the Government, while\r\nit avoids all interference with the social systems or local Institutions\r\nof every State, beyond that which Insurrection makes unavoidable and\r\nwhich a restoration of peaceful relations to the Union, under the\r\nConstitution, will immediately remove.\r\n                              \"Respectfully,\r\n                                   \"SIMON CAMERON,\r\n                                   \"Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\"Brigadier-General T.

Sherman, acting upon his own interpretation\r\nof these instructions, issued a proclamation to the people of South\r\nCarolina, upon occupying the Forts at Port Royal, in which he said:\r\n\r\n\"In obedience to the orders of the President of these United States of\r\nAmerica, I have landed on your shores with a small force of National\r\ntroops.  The dictates of a duty which, under these circumstances, I owe\r\nto a great sovereign State, and to a proud and hospitable people, among\r\nwhom I have passed some of the pleasantest days of my life, prompt me to\r\nproclaim that we have come amongst you with no feelings of personal\r\nanimosity, no desire to harm your citizens, destroy your property, or\r\ninterfere with any of your lawful rights or your social or local\r\nInstitutions, beyond what the causes herein alluded to may render\r\nunavoidable.\"\r\n\r\nMajor-General Wool, at Fortress Monroe, where he had succeeded General\r\nButler, likewise issued a Special Order on the subject of Contrabands,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,\r\n\"FORT MONROE, October 14, 1861.\r\n\"[Special Orders No. 72.]\r\n\r\n\"All Colored Persons called Contrabands, employed as servants by\r\nofficers and others residing within Fort Monroe, or outside of the Fort\r\nat Camp Hamilton and Camp Butler, will be furnished with their\r\nsubsistence and at least eight dollars per month for males, and four\r\ndollars per month for females, by the officers or others thus employing\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"So much of the above-named sums, as may be necessary to furnish\r\nclothing, to be decided by the Chief Quartermaster of the Department,\r\nwill be applied to that purpose, and the remainder will be paid into his\r\nhands to create a fund for the support of those Contrabands who are\r\nunable to work for their own support.\r\n\r\n\"All able-bodied Colored Persons who are under the protection of the\r\ntroops of this Department, and who are not employed as servants, will be\r\nimmediately put to work in either the Engineer's or Quartermaster's\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n\"By command of Major-General Wool:\r\n\r\n\"[Signed]  WILLIAM D.

The Department\r\nemploying these men will furnish the subsistence specified above, and as\r\nan incentive to good behavior (to be withheld at the direction of the\r\nchiefs of the departments respectively), each individual of the first\r\nclass will receive $2 per month, and each individual of the second class\r\n$1 per month, for their own use.  The remainder of the money valuation\r\nof their Labor, will be turned over to the Quartermaster, who will\r\ndeduct from it the cost of the clothing issued to them; the balance will\r\nconstitute a fund to be expended by the Quartermaster under the\r\ndirection of the Commanding officer of the Department of Virginia for\r\nthe support of the women and children and those that are unable to work.\r\n\r\n\"For any unusual amount of Labor performed, they may receive extra pay,\r\nvarying in amount from fifty cents to one dollar, this to be paid by the\r\ndepartments employing them, to the men themselves, and to be for their\r\nown use.\r\n\r\n\"Should any man be prevented from working, on account of sickness, for\r\nsix consecutive days, or ten days in any one month, one-half of the\r\nmoney value will be paid.

WHIPPLE,\r\n\"Assistant Adjutant General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn November 13, 1861, Major-General Dix, in a proclamation addressed to\r\nthe people of Accomac and Northampton Counties, Va., ordered the\r\nrepulsion of Fugitive Slaves seeking to enter the Union lines, in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"The Military Forces of the United States are about to enter your\r\nCounties as a part of the Union.  They will go among you as friends, and\r\nwith the earnest hope that they may not, by your own acts, be forced to\r\nbecome your enemies.  They will invade no rights of person or property.\r\nOn the contrary, your Laws, your Institutions, your Usages, will be\r\nscrupulously respected.  There need be no fear that the quietude of any\r\nfireside will be disturbed, unless the disturbance is caused by\r\nyourselves.\r\n\r\n\"Special directions have been given not to interfere with the condition\r\nof any Person held to domestic service; and, in order that there may be\r\nno ground for mistake or pretext for misrepresent action, Commanders of\r\nRegiments and Corps have been instructed not to permit any such Persons\r\nto come within their lines.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of November, 1861, Major General Halleck issued the\r\nfollowing Genera., Order--which went even further, in that it expelled,\r\nas well as repelled Fugitive Slaves from our lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF MISSOURI,\r\n\"St. Louis, November 20, 1861.\r\n\"[General Orders No. 3.]\r\n\r\n\"I.  It has been represented that important information respecting the\r\nnumber and condition of our Forces, is conveyed to the Enemy by means of\r\nFugitive Slaves who are admitted within our lines.  In order to remedy\r\nthis evil, it is directed that no such Persons be hereafter permitted to\r\nenter the lines of any camp, or of any forces on the march; and that any\r\nnow within such lines be immediately excluded therefrom.\"\r\n\r\nThis Order was subsequently explained in a letter, of December 8, 1861,\r\nfrom General Halleck to Hon. F. P.  Blair, in which he said:\r\n\r\n\" * * * Order No. 3 was in my mind, clearly a Military necessity.\r\nUnauthorized persons, black or white, Free or Slaves, must be kept out\r\nof our camps, unless we are willing to publish to the Enemy everything\r\nwe do or intend to do.  It was a Military and not a political order.  I\r\nam ready to carry out any lawful instructions in regard to Fugitive\r\nSlaves which my superiors may give me, and to enforce any law which\r\nCongress may pass.  But I cannot make law, and will not violate it.  You\r\nknow my private opinion on the policy of Confiscating the Slave Property\r\nof Rebels in Arms.  If Congress shall pass it, you may be certain that I\r\nshall enforce it.  Perhaps my policy as to the treatment of Rebels and\r\ntheir property is as well set out in Order No. 13, issued the day\r\n(December 4, 1861), your letter was written, as I could now describe\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be well also to add here, as belonging to this period of\r\ndoubtfulness touching the status of escaped Slaves, the following\r\ncommunication sent by Secretary Seward to General McClellan, touching\r\n\"Contrabands\" in the District of Columbia:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"DEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\"WASHINGTON, December 4, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"To Major-General GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN, Washington:\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL: I am directed by the President to call your attention to the\r\nfollowing subject:\r\n\r\n\"Persons claimed to be held to Service or Labor under the laws of the\r\nState of Virginia, and actually employed in hostile service against the\r\nGovernment of the United States, frequently escape from the lines of the\r\nEnemy's Forces and are received within the lines of the Army of the\r\nPotomac.\r\n\r\n\"This Department understands that such Persons afterward coming into the\r\ncity of Washington are liable to be arrested by the city police, upon\r\nthe presumption, arising from color, that they are Fugitives from\r\nService or Labor.\r\n\r\n\"By the 4th section of the Act of Congress approved August 6, 1861,\r\nentitled, 'An Act to Confiscate Property used for Insurrectionary\r\npurposes,' such hostile employment is made a full and sufficient answer\r\nto any further claim to Service or Labor.  Persons thus employed and\r\nescaping are received into the Military protection of the United States,\r\nand their arrest as Fugitives from Service or Labor should be\r\nimmediately followed by the Military arrest of the parties making the\r\nseizure.\r\n\r\n\"Copies of this communication will be sent to the Mayor of the city of\r\nWashington and to the Marshal of the District of Columbia, that any\r\ncollision between the Civil and Military authorities may be avoided.\r\n\r\n\"I am, General, your very obedient,\r\n\r\n                              \"WILLIAM H. SEWARD.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n                  \"COMPENSATED GRADUAL EMANCIPATION.\"\r\n\r\nThus far the reader's eye has been able to review in their successive\r\norder some of the many difficulties and perplexities which beset the\r\npathway of President Lincoln as he felt his way in the dark, as it were,\r\ntoward Emancipation.  It must seem pretty evident now, however, that his\r\nchief concern was for the preservation of the Union, even though all\r\nother things--Emancipation with them--had to be temporarily sacrificed.\r\n\r\nSomething definite, however, had been already gained.  Congress had\r\nasserted its right under the War powers of the Constitution, to release\r\nfrom all claim to Service or Labor those Slaves whose Service or Labor\r\nhad been used in hostility to the Union.  And while some of the Union\r\nGenerals obstructed the execution of the Act enforcing that right, by\r\nrepelling and even as we have seen, expelling, from the Union lines all\r\nFugitive Slaves--whether such as had or had not been used in hostility\r\nto us--yet still the cause of Freedom to all, was slowly and silently\r\nperhaps, yet surely and irresistibly, marching on until the time when,\r\nbecoming a chief factor in the determination of the question of \"whether\r\nwe should have a Country at all,\" it should triumph coincidently with\r\nthe preservation of the Republic.\r\n\r\nBut now a new phase of the Slave question arose--a question not\r\ninvolving what to do with Fugitive Slaves of any sort, whether engaged\r\nor not engaged in performing services hostile to the Union cause, but\r\nwhat to do with Slaves whom their panic-stricken owners had, for the\r\ntime being, abandoned in the presence of our Armies.\r\n\r\nThis question was well discussed in the original draft of the report of\r\nthe Secretary of War, December 1, 1861 in which Secretary Cameron said:\r\n\r\n\"It has become a grave question for determination what shall be done\r\nwith the Slaves abandoned by their owners on the advance of our troops\r\ninto Southern territory, as in the Beaufort district of South Carolina.\r\nThe whole White population therein is six thousand, while the number of\r\nNegroes exceeds thirty-two thousand.  The panic which drove their\r\nmasters in wild confusion from their homes, leaves them in undisputed\r\npossession of the soil.  Shall they, armed by their masters, be placed\r\nin the field to fight against us, or shall their labor be continually\r\nemployed in reproducing the means for supporting the Armies of\r\nRebellion?\r\n\r\n\"The War into which this Government has been forced by rebellious\r\nTraitors is carried on for the purpose of repossessing the property\r\nviolently and treacherously seized upon by the Enemies of the\r\nGovernment, and to re-establish the authority and Laws of the United\r\nStates in the places where it is opposed or overthrown by armed\r\nInsurrection and Rebellion.  Its purpose is to recover and defend what\r\nis justly its own.\r\n\r\n\"War, even between Independent Nations, is made to subdue the Enemy, and\r\nall that belongs to that Enemy, by occupying the hostile country, and\r\nexercising dominion over all the men and things within its territory.\r\nThis being true in respect to Independent Nations at war with each\r\nother, it follows that Rebels who are laboring by force of arms to\r\noverthrow a Government, justly bring upon themselves all the\r\nconsequences of War, and provoke the destruction merited by the worst of\r\ncrimes.  That Government would be false to National trust, and would\r\njustly excite the ridicule of the civilized World, that would abstain\r\nfrom the use of any efficient means to preserve its own existence, or to\r\novercome a rebellious and traitorous Enemy, by sparing or protecting the\r\nproperty of those who are waging War against it.\r\n\r\n\"The principal wealth and power of the Rebel States is a peculiar\r\nspecies of Property, consisting of the service or labor of African\r\nSlaves, or the descendants of Africans.  This Property has been\r\nvariously estimated at the value of from seven hundred million to one\r\nthousand million dollars.\r\n\r\n\"Why should this Property be exempt from the hazards and consequences of\r\na rebellious War?\r\n\r\n\"It was the boast of the leader of the Rebellion, while he yet had a\r\nseat in the Senate of the United States, that the Southern States would\r\nbe comparatively safe and free from the burdens of War, if it should be\r\nbrought on by the contemplated Rebellion, and that boast was accompanied\r\nby the savage threat that 'Northern towns and cities would become the\r\nvictims of rapine and Military spoil,' and that 'Northern men should\r\nsmell Southern gunpowder and feel Southern steel.'\r\n\r\n\"No one doubts the disposition of the Rebels to carry that threat into\r\nexecution.  The wealth of Northern towns and cities, the produce of\r\nNorthern farms, Northern workshops and manufactories would certainly be\r\nseized, destroyed, or appropriated as Military spoil.  No property in\r\nthe North would be spared from the hands of the Rebels, and their rapine\r\nwould be defended under the laws of War.  While the Loyal States thus\r\nhave all their property and possessions at stake, are the insurgent\r\nRebels to carry on warfare against the Government in peace and security\r\nto their own property?\r\n\r\n\"Reason and justice and self-preservation forbid that such should be;\r\nthe policy of this Government, but demand, on the contrary, that, being\r\nforced by Traitors and Rebels to the extremity of war, all the rights\r\nand powers of war should be exercised to bring it to a speedy end.\r\n\r\n\"Those who war against the Government justly forfeit all rights of\r\nproperty, privilege, or security, derived from the Constitution and\r\nLaws, against which they are in armed Rebellion; and as the labor and\r\nservice of their Slaves constitute the chief Property of the Rebels,\r\nsuch Property should share the common fate of War to which they have\r\ndevoted the property of Loyal citizens.\r\n\r\n\"While it is plain that the Slave Property of the South is justly\r\nsubjected to all the consequences of this Rebellious War, and that the\r\nGovernment would be untrue to its trust in not employing all the rights\r\nand powers of War to bring it to a speedy close, the details of the plan\r\nfor doing so, like all other Military measures, must, in a great degree,\r\nbe left to be determined by particular exigencies.  The disposition of\r\nother property belonging to the Rebels that becomes subject to our arms\r\nis governed by the circumstances of the case.\r\n\r\n\"The Government has no power to hold Slaves, none to restrain a Slave of\r\nhis Liberty, or to exact his service.  It has a right, however, to use\r\nthe voluntary service of Slaves liberated by War from their Rebel\r\nmasters, like any other property of the Rebels, in whatever mode may be\r\nmost efficient for the defense of the Government, the prosecution of the\r\nWar, and the suppression of Rebellion.  It is clearly a right of the\r\nGovernment to arm Slaves when it may become necessary, as it is to take\r\ngunpowder from the Enemy; whether it is expedient to do so, is purely a\r\nMilitary question.  The right is unquestionable by the laws of War.  The\r\nexpediency must be determined by circumstances, keeping in view the\r\ngreat object of overcoming the Rebels, reestablishing the Laws, and\r\nrestoring Peace to the Nation.\r\n\r\n\"It is vain and idle for the Government to carry on this War, or hope to\r\nmaintain its existence against rebellious force, without employing all\r\nthe rights and powers of War.  As has been said, the right to deprive\r\nthe Rebels of their Property in Slaves and Slave Labor is as clear and\r\nabsolute as the right to take forage from the field, or cotton from the\r\nwarehouse, or powder and arms from the magazine.  To leave the Enemy in\r\nthe possession of such property as forage and cotton and military\r\nstores, and the means of constantly reproducing them, would be madness.\r\nIt is, therefore, equal madness to leave them in peaceful and secure\r\npossession of Slave Property, more valuable and efficient to them for\r\nwar than forage, cotton, military stores.  Such policy would be National\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\n\"What to do with that species of Property is a question that time and\r\ncircumstances will solve, and need not be anticipated further than to\r\nrepeat that they cannot be held by the Government as Slaves.  It would\r\nbe useless to keep them as prisoners of War; and self-preservation, the\r\nhighest duty of a Government, or of individuals, demands that they\r\nshould be disposed of or employed in the most effective manner that will\r\ntend most speedily to suppress the Insurrection and restore the\r\nauthority of the Government.  If it shall be found that the men who have\r\nbeen held by the Rebels as Slaves, are capable of bearing arms and\r\nperforming efficient Military service, it is the right, and may become\r\nthe duty, of this Government to arm and equip them, and employ their\r\nservices against the Rebels, under proper Military regulations,\r\ndiscipline, and command.\r\n\r\n\"But in whatever manner they may be used by the Government, it is plain\r\nthat, once liberated by the rebellious act of their masters they should\r\nnever again be restored to bondage.  By the master's Treason and\r\nRebellion he forfeits all right to the labor and service of his Slave;\r\nand the Slave of the rebellious master, by his service to the\r\nGovernment, becomes justly entitled to Freedom and protection.\r\n\r\n\"The disposition to be made of the Slaves of Rebels, after the close of\r\nthe War, can be safely left to the wisdom and patriotism of Congress.\r\nThe Representatives of the People will unquestionably secure to the\r\nLoyal Slaveholders every right to which they are entitled under the\r\nConstitution of the Country.\"\r\n\r\nThis original draft of the report was modified, at the instance of\r\nPresident Lincoln, to the following--and thus appeared in Secretary\r\nCameron's report of that date, as printed:\r\n\r\n\"It is already a grave question what shall be done with those Slaves who\r\nwere abandoned by their owners on the advance of our troops into\r\nSouthern territory, as at Beaufort district, in South Carolina.  The\r\nnumber left within our control at that point is very considerable, and\r\nsimilar cases will probably occur.  What should be done with them?  Can\r\nwe afford to send them forward to their masters, to be by them armed\r\nagainst us, or used in producing supplies to sustain the Rebellion?\r\n\r\n\"Their labor may be useful to us; withheld from the Enemy it lessens his\r\nMilitary resources, and withholding them has no tendency to induce the\r\nhorrors of Insurrection, even in the Rebel communities.  They constitute\r\na Military resource, and, being such, that they should not be turned\r\nover to the Enemy is too plain to discuss.  Why deprive him of supplies\r\nby a blockade, and voluntarily give him men to produce them?\r\n\r\n\"The disposition to be made of the Slaves of Rebels, after the close of\r\nthe War, can be safely left to the wisdom and patriotism of Congress.\r\nThe Representatives of the People will unquestionably secure to the\r\nLoyal Slaveholders every right to which they are entitled under the\r\nConstitution of the Country.\r\n\r\nSIMON CAMERON.\r\n\"Secretary of War.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe language of this modification is given to show that the President,\r\nat the close of the year 1861, had already reached a further step\r\nforward toward Emancipation--and the sound reasoning upon which he made\r\nthat advance.  He was satisfying his own mind and conscience as he\r\nproceeded, and thus, while justifying himself to himself, was also\r\nsimultaneously carrying conviction to the minds and consciences of the\r\nPeople, whose servant and agent he was.\r\n\r\nThat these abandoned Slaves would \"constitute a Military resource\" and\r\n\"should not be turned over to the Enemy\" and that \"their labor may be\r\nuseful to us\" were propositions which could not be gainsaid.  But to\r\nquiet uncalled-for apprehensions, and to encourage Southern loyalty, he\r\nadded, in substance, that at the close of this War--waged solely for the\r\npreservation of the Union--Congress would decide the doubtful status of\r\nthe Slaves of Rebels, while the rights of Union Slave-holders would be\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\nThe Contraband-Slave question, however, continued to agitate the public\r\nmind for many months--owing to the various ways in which it was treated\r\nby the various Military commanders, to whose discretion its treatment,\r\nin their several commands, was left--a discretion which almost\r\ninvariably leaned toward the political bias of the commander.  Thus, in\r\na proclamation, dated St. Louis, February 23, 1862, Halleck, commanding\r\nthe Department of Missouri, said:\r\n\r\n\"Soldiers! let no excess on your part tarnish the glory of our arms!\r\n\r\n\"The order heretofore issued in this department, in regard to pillaging\r\nand marauding, the destruction of private property, and the stealing or\r\nconcealment of Slaves, must be strictly enforced.  It does not belong to\r\nthe Military to decide upon the relation of Master and Slave.  Such\r\nquestions must be settled by the civil Courts.  No Fugitive Slaves will\r\ntherefore be admitted within our lines or camps, except when especially\r\nordered by the General Commanding.  * * * \"\r\n\r\nAnd Buell, commanding the Department of the Ohio, in response to a\r\ncommunication on the subject from the Chairman of the Military Committee\r\nof the Kentucky Legislature, wrote, March 6, 1862:\r\n\r\n\"It has come to my knowledge that Slaves sometimes make their way\r\nimproperly into our lines, and in some instances they may be enticed\r\nthere, but I think the number has been magnified by report.  Several\r\napplications have been made to me by persons whose servants have been\r\nfound in our camps, and in every instance that I know of the master has\r\nrecovered his servant and taken him away.\"\r\n\r\nThus, while some of our Commanders, like Dix and Halleck, repelled or\r\neven expelled the Fugitive Slave from their lines; and others, like\r\nBuell and Hooker, facilitated the search for, and restoration to his\r\nmaster, of the black Fugitive found within our lines; on the other hand,\r\nFremont, as we have seen, and Doubleday and Hunter, as we shall yet see,\r\ntook totally different ground on this question.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln, however, harassed as he was by the extremists on both\r\nsides of the Slavery question, still maintained that calm statesman-like\r\nmiddle-course from which the best results were likely to flow.  But he\r\nnow thought the time had come to broach the question of a compensated,\r\ngradual Emancipation.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on March 6, 1862, he sent to Congress the following\r\nmessage:\r\n\r\n\"Fellow citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\n\"I recommend the adoption of a joint Resolution by your honorable\r\nbodies, which shall be substantially as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the United States ought to co-operate with any State\r\nwhich may adopt gradual abolishment of Slavery, giving to such State\r\npecuniary aid, to be used by such State in its discretion, to compensate\r\nfor the inconveniences, public and private, produced by such change of\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\"If the proposition contained in the Resolution does not meet the\r\napproval of Congress and the Country, there is the end; but if it does\r\ncommand such approval, I deem it of importance that the States and\r\npeople immediately interested should be at once distinctly notified of\r\nthe fact, so that they may begin to consider whether to accept or reject\r\nit, The Federal Government would find its highest interest in such a\r\nmeasure, as one of the most efficient means of self preservation.\r\n\r\n\"The leaders of the existing Insurrection entertain the hope that this\r\nGovernment will ultimately be forced to acknowledge the Independence of\r\nsome part of the disaffected region, and that all the Slave States North\r\nof such part will then say, 'the Union for which we have struggled being\r\nalready gone, we now choose to go with the Southern Section.'\r\n\r\n\"To deprive them of this hope, substantially ends the Rebellion; and the\r\ninitiation of Emancipation completely deprives them of it, as to all the\r\nStates initiating it.  The point is not that all the States tolerating\r\nSlavery would very soon, if at all, initiate Emancipation; but that,\r\nwhile the offer is equally made to all, the more Northern shall, by such\r\ninitiation, make it certain to the more Southern that in no event will\r\nthe former ever join the latter in their proposed Confederacy.  I say,\r\n'initiation,' because in my judgment, gradual, and not sudden\r\nEmancipation, is better for all.\r\n\r\n\"In the mere financial or pecuniary view, any member of Congress, with\r\nthe census tables and Treasury reports before him, can readily see for\r\nhimself how very soon the current expenditures of this War would\r\npurchase, at fair valuation, all the Slaves in any named State.\r\n\r\n\"Such a proposition on the part of the General Government sets up no\r\nclaim of a right by Federal authority to interfere with Slavery within\r\nState limits, referring, as it does, the absolute control of the subject\r\nin each case to the State and its people immediately interested.  It is\r\nproposed as a matter of perfectly free choice with them.\r\n\r\n\"In the Annual Message last December, I thought fit to say, 'the Union\r\nmust be preserved; and hence all indispensable means must be employed.'\r\nI said this, not hastily, but deliberately.  War has been made, and\r\ncontinues to be an indispensable means to this end.  A practical\r\nreacknowledgment of the National authority would render the War\r\nunnecessary, and it would at once cease.  If, however, resistance\r\ncontinues, the War must also continue; and it is impossible to foresee\r\nall the incidents which may attend, and all the ruin which may follow\r\nit.  Such as may seem indispensable, or may obviously promise great\r\nefficiency toward ending the struggle, must and will come.\r\n\r\n\"The proposition now made, though an offer only, I hope it may be\r\nesteemed no offense to ask whether the pecuniary consideration tendered\r\nwould not be of more value to the States and private persons concerned,\r\nthan are the Institution, and Property in it, in the present aspect of\r\naffairs?\r\n\r\n\"While it is true that the adoption of the proposed resolution would be\r\nmerely initiatory, and not within itself a practical measure, it is\r\nrecommended in the hope that it would soon lead to important practical\r\nresults.  In full view of my great responsibility to my God and to my\r\nCountry, I earnestly beg the attention of Congress and the People to the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\"March 6, 1862.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the above suggestion from the President, a Joint\r\nResolution, in the precise words suggested, was introduced into the\r\nHouse, March 10, by Roscoe Conkling, and on the following day was\r\nadopted in the House by 97 yeas to 36 nays.\r\n\r\nOf the 36 members of the House who voted against this Resolution, were\r\n34 Democrats, and among them were Messrs. Crisfield of Maryland, and\r\nMessrs. Crittenden, Mallory, and Menzies of Kentucky.  These gentleman\r\nafterward made public a report, drawn by themselves, of an interesting\r\ninterview they had held with President Lincoln on this important\r\nsubject, in the words following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"MEMORANDUM OF AN INTERVIEW BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND SOME BORDER\r\nSLAVE-STATE REPRESENTATIVES MARCH 10, 1862.\r\n\r\n\"'DEAR SIR:--I called, at the request of the President, to ask you to\r\ncome to the White House to-morrow morning, at nine o'clock, and bring\r\nsuch of your colleagues as are in town.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'WASHINGTON, March 10, 1862.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday on my return from church I found Mr. Postmaster General Blair\r\nin my room, writing the above note, which he immediately suspended, and\r\nverbally communicated the President's invitation; and stated that the\r\nPresident's purpose was to have some conversation with the delegations\r\nof Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware, in explanation\r\nof his Message of the 6th inst.\r\n\r\n\"This morning these delegations, or such of them as were in town,\r\nassembled at the White House at the appointed time, and after some\r\nlittle delay were admitted to an audience.\r\n\r\n\"After the usual salutations and we were seated, the President said, in\r\nsubstance, that he had invited us to meet him to have some conversation\r\nwith us in explanation of his Message of the 6th; that since he had sent\r\nit in, several of the gentlemen then present had visited him, but had\r\navoided any allusion to the Message, and he therefore inferred that the\r\nimport of the Message had been misunderstood, and was regarded as\r\ninimical to the interests we represented; and he had resolved he would\r\ntalk with us, and disabuse our minds of that erroneous opinion.\r\n\r\n\"The President then disclaimed any intent to injure the interests or\r\nwound the sensibilities of the Slave States.  On the contrary, his\r\npurpose was to protect the one and respect the other; that we were\r\nengaged in a terrible, wasting, and tedious War; immense Armies were in\r\nthe field, and must continue in the field as long as the War lasts; that\r\nthese Armies must, of necessity, be brought into contact with Slaves in\r\nthe States we represented and in other States as they advanced; that\r\nSlaves would come to the camps, and continual irritation was kept up;\r\nthat he was constantly annoyed by conflicting and antagonistic\r\ncomplaints; on the one side, a certain class complained if the Slave was\r\nnot protected by the Army; persons were frequently found who,\r\nparticipating in these views, acted in a way unfriendly to the\r\nSlaveholder; on the other hand, Slaveholders complained that their\r\nrights were interfered with, their Slaves induced to abscond, and\r\nprotected within the lines, these complaints were numerous, loud, and\r\ndeep; were a serious annoyance to him and embarrassing to the progress\r\nof the War; that it kept alive a spirit hostile to the Government in the\r\nStates we represented; strengthened the hopes of the Confederates that\r\nat some day the Border States would unite with them, and thus tend to\r\nprolong the War; and he was of opinion, if this Resolution should be\r\nadopted by Congress and accepted by our States, these causes of\r\nirritation and these hopes would be removed, and more would be\r\naccomplished towards shortening the War than could be hoped from the\r\ngreatest victory achieved by Union Armies; that he made this proposition\r\nin good faith, and desired it to be accepted, if at all, voluntarily,\r\nand in the same patriotic spirit in which it was made; that Emancipation\r\nwas a subject exclusively under the control of the States, and must be\r\nadopted or rejected by each for itself; that he did not claim nor had\r\nthis Government any right to coerce them for that purpose; that such was\r\nno part of his purpose in making this proposition, and he wished it to\r\nbe clearly understood; that he did not expect us there to be prepared to\r\ngive him an answer, but he hoped we would take the subject into serious\r\nconsideration; confer with one another, and then take such course as we\r\nfelt our duty and the interests of our constituents required of us.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Noell, of Missouri, said that in his State, Slavery was not\r\nconsidered a permanent Institution; that natural causes were there in\r\noperation which would, at no distant day, extinguish it, and he did not\r\nthink that this proposition was necessary for that; and, besides that,\r\nhe and his friends felt solicitous as to the Message on account of the\r\ndifferent constructions which the Resolution and Message had received.\r\nThe New York Tribune was for it, and understood it to mean that we must\r\naccept gradual Emancipation according to the plan suggested, or get\r\nsomething worse.\r\n\r\n\"The President replied, he must not be expected to quarrel with the New\r\nYork Tribune before the right time; he hoped never to have to do it; he\r\nwould not anticipate events.  In respect to Emancipation in Missouri, he\r\nsaid that what had been observed by Mr. Noell was probably true, but the\r\noperation of these natural causes had not prevented the irritating\r\nconduct to which he had referred, or destroyed the hopes of the\r\nConfederates that Missouri would at some time range herself alongside of\r\nthem, which, in his judgment, the passage of this Resolution by\r\nCongress, and its acceptance by Missouri, would accomplish.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Crisfield, of Maryland, asked what would be the effect of the\r\nrefusal of the State to accept this proposal, and desired to know if the\r\nPresident looked to any policy beyond the acceptance or rejection of\r\nthis scheme.\r\n\r\n\"The President replied that he had no designs beyond the action of the\r\nStates on this particular subject.  He should lament their refusal to\r\naccept it, but he had no designs beyond their refusal of it.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Menzies, of Kentucky, inquired if the President thought there was\r\nany power, except in the States themselves, to carry out his scheme of\r\nEmancipation?\r\n\r\n\"The President replied, he thought there could not be.  He then went off\r\ninto a course of remark not qualifying the foregoing declaration, nor\r\nmaterial to be repeated to a just understanding of his meaning.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Crisfield said he did not think the people of Maryland looked upon\r\nSlavery as a permanent Institution; and he did not know that they would\r\nbe very reluctant to give it up if provision was made to meet the loss,\r\nand they could be rid of the race; but they did not like to be coerced\r\ninto Emancipation, either by the direct action of the Government or by\r\nindirection, as through the Emancipation of Slaves in this District, or\r\nthe Confiscation of Southern Property as now threatened; and he thought\r\nbefore they would consent to consider this proposition they would\r\nrequire to be informed on these points.\r\n\r\n\"The President replied that 'unless he was expelled by the act of God or\r\nthe Confederate Armies, he should occupy that house for three years, and\r\nas long as he remained there, Maryland had nothing to fear, either for\r\nher Institutions or her interests, on the points referred to.'\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Crisfield immediately added: 'Mr. President, what you now say could\r\nbe heard by the people of Maryland, they would consider your proposition\r\nwith a much better feeling than I fear without it they will be inclined\r\nto do.'\r\n\r\n\"The President: 'That (meaning a publication of what he said), will not\r\ndo; it would force me into a quarrel before the proper time;' and again\r\nintimating, as he had before done, that a quarrel with the 'Greeley\r\nfaction' was impending, he said, 'he did not wish to encounter it before\r\nthe proper time, nor at all if it could be avoided.'\r\n\r\n\"Governor Wickliffe, of Kentucky, then asked him respecting the\r\nConstitutionality of his scheme.\r\n\r\n\"The President replied: 'As you may suppose, I have considered that; and\r\nthe proposition now submitted does not encounter any Constitutional\r\ndifficulty.  It proposes simply to co-operate with any State by giving\r\nsuch State pecuniary aid;' and he thought that the Resolution, as\r\nproposed by him, would be considered rather as the expression of a\r\nsentiment than as involving any Constitutional question.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hall, of Missouri, thought that if this proposition was adopted at\r\nall, it should be by the votes of the Free States, and come as a\r\nproposition from them to the Slave States, affording them an inducement\r\nto put aside this subject of discord; that it ought not to be expected\r\nthat members representing Slaveholding Constituencies should declare at\r\nonce, and in advance of any proposition to them, for the Emancipation of\r\nSlaves.\r\n\r\n\"The President said he saw and felt the force of the objection; it was a\r\nfearful responsibility, and every gentleman must do as he thought best;\r\nthat he did not know how this scheme was received by the Members from\r\nthe Free States; some of them had spoken to him and received it kindly;\r\nbut for the most part they were as reserved and chary as we had been,\r\nand he could not tell how they would vote.\r\n\r\n\"And, in reply to some expression of Mr. Hall as to his own opinion\r\nregarding Slavery, he said he did not pretend to disguise his\r\nAnti-Slavery feeling; that he thought it was wrong and should continue\r\nto think so; but that was not the question we had to deal with now.\r\nSlavery existed, and that, too, as well by the act of the North, as of\r\nthe South; and in any scheme to get rid of it, the North, as well as the\r\nSouth, was morally bound to do its full and equal share.  He thought the\r\nInstitution, wrong, and ought never to have existed; but yet he\r\nrecognized the rights of Property which had grown out of it, and would\r\nrespect those rights as fully as similar rights in any other property;\r\nthat Property can exist, and does legally exist.  He thought such a law,\r\nwrong, but the rights of Property resulting must be respected; he would\r\nget rid of the odious law, not by violating the right, but by\r\nencouraging the proposition, and offering inducements to give it up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here the interview, so far as this subject is concerned, terminated by\r\nMr. Crittenden's assuring the President that whatever might be our final\r\naction, we all thought him solely moved by a high patriotism and sincere\r\ndevotion to the happiness and glory of his Country; and with that\r\nconviction we should consider respectfully the important suggestions he\r\nhad made.\r\n\r\n\"After some conversation on the current war news we retired, and I\r\nimmediately proceeded to my room and wrote out this paper.\r\n                              \"J.

Cobb, Haight, Lehman, and Sheffield) voted in the\r\naffirmative, and but two Republicans (Francis Thomas, and Leary) in the\r\nnegative.  On the 2nd of April, it passed the Senate by a vote of 32\r\nyeas--all Republicans save Messrs. Davis and Thomson--to 10 nays, all\r\nDemocrats.\r\n\r\nMeantime the question of the treatment of the \"Contraband\" in our\r\nMilitary camps, continued to grow in importance.\r\n\r\nOn March 26, 1862, General Hooker issued the following order touching\r\ncertain Fugitive Slaves and their alleged owners:\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS, HOOKER'S DIVISION, CAMP BAKER,\r\n\"LOWER POTOMAC, March 26, 1862.\r\n\r\n\"To BRIGADE AND REGIMENTAL COMMANDERS OF THIS DIVISION:\r\n\r\n\"Messrs.  Nally, Gray, Dummington, Dent, Adams, Speake, Price, Posey,\r\nand Cobey, citizens of Maryland, have Negroes supposed to be with some\r\nof the regiments of this Division; the Brigadier General commanding\r\ndirects that they be permitted to visit all the camps of his command, in\r\nsearch of their Property, and if found, that they be allowed to take\r\npossession of the same, without any interference whatever.  Should any\r\nobstacle be thrown in their way by any officer or soldier in the\r\nDivision, they will be at once reported by the regimental commanders to\r\nthese headquarters.\r\n\r\n\"By command of Brigadier General Hooker;\r\n\r\n\"JOSEPH DICKINSON,\r\n\"Assistant Adjutant General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following day, by direction of General Sickles, the following\r\nsignificant report was made touching the above order:\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS, SECOND REGIMENT, EXCELSIOR BRIGADE.\r\n\"CAMP HALL, March 27, 1862.\r\n\r\n\"LIEUTENANT:--In compliance with verbal directions from Brigadier\r\nGeneral D. E. Sickles, to report as to the occurrence at this camp on\r\nthe afternoon of the 26th instant, I beg leave to submit the following:\r\n\r\n\"At about 3:30 o'clock P. M., March 26, 1862, admission within our lines\r\nwas demanded by a party of horsemen (civilians), numbering, perhaps,\r\nfifteen.  They presented the lieutenant commanding the guard, with an\r\norder of entrance from Brigadier General Joseph Hooker, Commanding\r\nDivision (copy appended), the order stating that nine men should be\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\n\"I ordered that the balance of the party should remain without the\r\nlines; which was done.  Upon the appearance of the others, there was\r\nvisible dissatisfaction and considerable murmuring among the soldiers,\r\nto so great an extent that I almost feared for the safety of the\r\nSlaveholders.  At this time General Sickles opportunely arrived, and\r\ninstructed me to order them outside the camp, which I did, amidst the\r\nloud cheers of our soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"It is proper to add, that before entering our lines, and within about\r\nseventy-five or one hundred yards of our camp, one of their number\r\ndischarged two pistol shots at a Negro, who was running past them, with\r\nan evident intention of taking his life.  This justly enraged our men.\r\n\r\n          \"All of which is respectfully submitted.\r\n\r\n                    \"Your obedient servant,\r\n                    \"JOHN TOLEN.\r\n               \"Major Commanding Second Regiment, E.

The General is of the opinion that\r\nthey bring much valuable information, which cannot be obtained from any\r\nother source.  They are acquainted with all the roads, paths, fords, and\r\nother natural features of the country, and they make excellent guides.\r\nThey also know and frequently have exposed the haunts of Secession spies\r\nand Traitors and the existence of Rebel organizations.  They will not,\r\ntherefore, be excluded.\r\n\r\n\"The General also directs me to say that civil process cannot be served\r\ndirectly in the camps or forts of his command, without full authority be\r\nobtained from the Commanding Officer for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\"I am very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\"E.

The vote on its passage in the Senate was\r\n29 yeas to 14 nays--all the yeas being Republican, and all but two of\r\nthe nays Democratic.\r\n\r\nApril 11th, the Bill passed the House by 92 yeas to 39 nays--all the\r\nyeas save 5 being Republican, and all the nays, save three, being\r\nDemocratic.\r\n\r\nApril 7, 1862, the House adopted a resolution, by 67 yeas to 52 nays\r\n--all the yeas, save one, Republican, and all the nays, save 12,\r\nDemocratic--for the appointment of a Select Committee of nine, to\r\nconsider and report whether any plan could be proposed and recommended\r\nfor the gradual Emancipation of all the African Slaves, and the\r\nextinction of Slavery in Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky,\r\nTennessee, and Missouri, by the people or local authorities thereof, and\r\nhow far and in what way the Government of the United States could and\r\nought equitably to aid in facilitating either of those objects.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th President Lincoln sent the following Message to Congress:\r\n\r\n\"Fellow citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\n\"The Act entitled 'An Act for the release of certain Persons held to\r\nService or Labor in the District of Columbia,' has this day been\r\napproved and signed.\r\n\r\n\"I have never doubted the Constitutional authority of Congress to\r\nabolish Slavery in this District; and I have ever desired to see the\r\nNational Capital freed from the Institution in some satisfactory way.\r\nHence there has never been in my mind any question upon the subject\r\nexcept the one of expediency, arising in view of all the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"If there be matters within and about this Act which might have taken a\r\ncourse or shape more satisfactory to my judgment, I do not attempt to\r\nspecify them.  I am gratified that the two principles of compensation\r\nand colonization are both recognized and practically applied in the Act.\r\n\r\n\"In the matter of compensation, it is provided that claims may be\r\npresented within ninety days from the passage of the Act, 'but not\r\nthereafter;' and there is no saving for minors, femmes covert, insane,\r\nor absent persons.  I presume this is an omission by mere oversight, and\r\nI recommend that it be supplied by an amendatory or Supplemental Act.\r\n\r\n\"ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\"April 16, 1862.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSubsequently, in order to meet the President's views, such an amendatory\r\nor Supplemental Act was passed and approved.\r\n\r\nBut now, Major General Hunter having taken upon himself to issue an\r\nEmancipation proclamation, May 9, 1862, the President, May 19, 1862,\r\nissued a proclamation rescinding it as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas there appears in the public prints what purports to be a\r\nproclamation of Major General Hunter, in the words and figures\r\nfollowing, to wit:\r\n\r\n\"'HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,\r\n'HILTON HEAD, S. C., May 9, 1862.\r\n'[General Orders No.  11.]\r\n\r\n'The three States of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina, comprising\r\nthe Military Department of the South, having deliberately declared\r\nthemselves no longer under the protection of the United States of\r\nAmerica, and having taken up arms against the said United States, it\r\nbecomes a Military necessity to declare them under Martial Law.  This\r\nwas accordingly done on the 25th day of April, 1862.  Slavery and\r\nMartial Law, in a Free Country, are altogether incompatible; the Persons\r\nin these three States--Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina-heretofore\r\nheld as Slaves, are therefore declared forever Free.\r\n\r\n'DAVID HUNTER,\r\n'Major-General Commanding.\r\n\r\n'Official:\r\nED.

And further, that neither General Hunter, nor\r\nany other Commander, or person, has been authorized by the Government of\r\nthe United States to make proclamations declaring the Slaves of any\r\nState Free; and that the supposed proclamation, now in question, whether\r\ngenuine or false, is altogether void, so far as respects such\r\ndeclaration.\r\n\r\n\"I further make known that whether it be competent for me, as\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, to declare the Slaves of any\r\nState or States free, and whether, at any time, in any case, it shall\r\nhave become a necessity indispensable to the maintenance of the\r\nGovernment, to exercise such supposed power, are questions which, under\r\nmy responsibility, I reserve to myself, and which I cannot feel\r\njustified in leaving to the decision of Commanders in the field.  These\r\nare totally different questions from those of police regulations in\r\narmies and camps.\r\n\r\n\"On the sixth day of March last, by a Special Message, I recommended to\r\nCongress the adoption of a Joint Resolution to be substantially as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"' Resolved, That the United States ought to co-operate with any State\r\nwhich may adopt a gradual abolishment of Slavery, giving to such State\r\npecuniary aid, to be used by such State, in its discretion, to\r\ncompensate for the inconveniences, public and private, produced by such\r\nchange of system.'\r\n\r\n\"The Resolution, in the language above quoted, was adopted by large\r\nmajorities in both branches of Congress, and now stands an authentic,\r\ndefinite, and solemn proposal of the Nation to the States and people\r\nmost immediately interested in the subject-matter.  To the people of\r\nthose States I now earnestly appeal--I do not argue--I beseech you to\r\nmake the argument for yourselves--you cannot, if you would, be blind to\r\nthe signs of the times--I beg of you a calm and enlarged consideration\r\nof them, ranging, if it may be, far above personal and partisan\r\npolitics.  This proposal makes common cause for a common object, casting\r\nno reproaches upon any.  It acts not the Pharisee.  The changes it\r\ncontemplates would come gently as the dews of Heaven, not rending or\r\nwrecking anything.  Will you not embrace it?  So much good has not been\r\ndone, by one effort, in all past time, as, in the providence of God, it\r\nis now your high privilege to do.

These\r\nviews amount to convictions, and are deeply impressed upon my mind and\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\"Our cause must never be abandoned; it is the cause of Free institutions\r\nand Self-government.  The Constitution and the Union must be preserved,\r\nwhatever may be the cost in time, treasure, and blood.\r\n\r\n\"If Secession is successful, other dissolutions are clearly to be seen\r\nin the future.  Let neither Military disaster, political faction, nor\r\nForeign War shake your settled purpose to enforce the equal operation of\r\nthe Laws of the United States upon the people of every State.\r\n\r\n\"The time has come when the Government must determine upon a Civil and\r\nMilitary policy, covering the whole ground of our National trouble.\r\n\r\n\"The responsibility of determining, declaring, and supporting such Civil\r\nand Military policy, and of directing the whole course of National\r\naffairs in regard to the Rebellion, must now be assumed and exercised by\r\nyou, or our Cause will be lost.  The Constitution gives you power, even\r\nfor the present terrible exigency.\r\n\r\n\"This Rebellion has assumed the character of a War; as such it should be\r\nregarded, and it should be conducted upon the highest principles known\r\nto Christian civilization.  It should not be a War looking to the\r\nsubjugation of the people of any State, in any event.  It should not be\r\nat all a war upon population, but against armed forces and political\r\norganizations.  Neither Confiscation of property, political executions\r\nof persons, territorial organizations of States, or forcible Abolition\r\nof Slavery, should be contemplated for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"In prosecuting the War, all private property and unarmed persons should\r\nbe strictly protected, subject only to the necessity of Military\r\noperations; all private property taken for Military use should be paid\r\nor receipted for; pillage and waste should be treated as high crimes;\r\nall unnecessary trespass sternly prohibited and offensive demeanor by\r\nthe military towards citizens promptly rebuked.\r\n\r\n\"Military arrests should not be tolerated, except in places where active\r\nhostilities exist; and oaths, not required by enactments,\r\nConstitutionally made, should be neither demanded nor received.\r\n\r\n\"Military Government should be confined to the preservation of public\r\norder and the protection of political right.  Military power should not\r\nbe allowed to interfere with the relations of Servitude, either by\r\nsupporting or impairing the authority of the master, except for\r\nrepressing disorder, as in other cases.  Slaves, contraband under the\r\nAct of Congress, seeking Military protection, should receive it.\r\n\r\n\"The right of the Government to appropriate permanently to its own\r\nservice claims to Slave-labor should be asserted, and the right of the\r\nowner to compensation therefor should be recognized.\r\n\r\n\"This principle might be extended, upon grounds of Military necessity\r\nand security, to all the Slaves of a particular State, thus working\r\nmanumission in such State; and in Missouri, perhaps in Western Virginia\r\nalso, and possibly even in Maryland, the expediency of such a measure is\r\nonly a question of time.\r\n\r\n\"A system of policy thus Constitutional, and pervaded by the influences\r\nof Christianity and Freedom, would receive the support of almost all\r\ntruly Loyal men, would deeply impress the Rebel masses and all foreign\r\nnations, and it might be humbly hoped that it would commend itself to\r\nthe favor of the Almighty.\r\n\r\n\"Unless the principles governing the future conduct of our Struggle\r\nshall be made known and approved, the effort to obtain requisite forces\r\nwill be almost hopeless.  A declaration of radical views, especially\r\nupon Slavery, will rapidly disintegrate our present Armies.\r\n\r\n\"The policy of the Government must be supported by concentrations of\r\nMilitary power.  The National Forces should not be dispersed in\r\nexpeditions, posts of occupation, and numerous armies, but should be\r\nmainly collected into masses, and brought to bear upon the Armies of the\r\nConfederate States.  Those Armies thoroughly defeated, the political\r\nstructure which they support would soon cease to exist,\r\n\r\n\"In carrying out any system of policy which you may form, you will\r\nrequire a Commander-in-chief of the Army, one who possesses your\r\nconfidence, understands your views, and who is competent to execute your\r\norders, by directing the Military Forces of the Nation to the\r\naccomplishment of the objects by you proposed.  I do not ask that place\r\nfor myself, I am willing to serve you in such position as you may assign\r\nme, and I will do so as faithfully as ever subordinate served superior.\r\n\r\n\"I may be on the brink of Eternity; and as I hope forgiveness from my\r\nMaker, I have written this letter with sincerity towards you and from\r\nlove for my Country.\r\n\r\n\"Very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\"GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN,\r\n\"Major-General Commanding.\r\n\r\n\"His Excellency A. LINCOLN, President.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJuly 12, 1862, Senators and Representatives of the Border Slave-holding\r\nStates, having been specially invited to the White House for the\r\npurpose, were addressed by President Lincoln, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"GENTLEMEN:--After the adjournment of Congress, now near, I shall have\r\nno opportunity of seeing you for several months.  Believing that you of\r\nthe Border States hold more power for good than any other equal number\r\nof members, I feel it a duty which I cannot justifiably waive, to make\r\nthis appeal to you.\r\n\r\n\"I intend no reproach or complaint when I assure you that, in my\r\nopinion, if you all had voted for the Resolution in the Gradual\r\nEmancipation Message of last March, the War would now be substantially\r\nended.  And the plan therein proposed is yet one of the most potent and\r\nswift means of ending it.  Let the States which are in Rebellion see\r\ndefinitely and certainly that in no event will the States you represent\r\never join their proposed Confederacy, and they cannot much longer\r\nmaintain the contest.\r\n\r\n\"But you cannot divest them of their hope to ultimately have you with\r\nthem so long as you show a determination to perpetuate the Institution\r\nwithin your own States.  Beat them at elections, as you have\r\noverwhelmingly done, and nothing daunted, they still claim you as their\r\nown.  You and I know what the lever of their power is.  Break that lever\r\nbefore their faces, and they can shake you no more forever.\r\n\r\n\"Most of you have treated me with kindness and consideration, and I\r\ntrust you will not now think I improperly touch what is exclusively your\r\nown, when, for the sake of the whole Country, I ask, 'Can you, for your\r\nStates, do better than to take the course I urge?' Discarding punctilio\r\nand maxims adapted to more manageable times, and looking only to the\r\nunprecedentedly stern facts of our case, can you do better in any\r\npossible event?\r\n\r\n\"You prefer that the Constitutional relations of the States to the\r\nNation shall be practically restored without disturbance of the\r\nInstitution; and, if this were done, my whole duty, in this respect,\r\nunder the Constitution and my oath of office, would be performed.  But\r\nit is not done, and we are trying to accomplish it by War.\r\n\r\n\"The incidents of the War cannot be avoided.  If the War continues long,\r\nas it must, if the object be not sooner attained, the Institution in\r\nyour States will be extinguished by mere friction and abrasion--by the\r\nmere incidents of the War.  It will be gone, and you will have nothing\r\nvaluable in lieu of it.  Much of its value is gone already.\r\n\r\n\"How much better for you and for your people to take the step which at\r\nonce shortens the War and secures substantial compensation for that\r\nwhich is sure to be wholly lost in any other event!  How much better to\r\nthus save the money which else we sink forever in the War!  How: much\r\nbetter to do it while we can, lest the War ere long render us\r\npecuniarily unable to do it!  How much better for you, as seller, and\r\nthe Nation, as buyer, to sell out and buy out that without which the War\r\ncould never have been, than to sink both the thing to be sold and the\r\nprice of it in cutting one another's throats!\r\n\r\n\"I do not speak of Emancipation at once, but of a decision at once to\r\nEmancipate gradually.  Room in South America for colonization can be\r\nobtained cheaply and in abundance, and when numbers shall be large\r\nenough to be company and encouragement for one another, the freed people\r\nwill not be so reluctant to go.\r\n\r\n\"I am pressed with a difficulty not yet mentioned; one which threatens\r\ndivision among those who, united, are none too strong.  An instance of\r\nit is known to you.  General Hunter is an honest man.  He was, and I\r\nhope still is, my friend.  I value him none the less for his agreeing\r\nwith me in the general wish that all men everywhere could be freed.  He\r\nproclaimed all men Free within certain States, and I repudiated the\r\nproclamation.  He expected more good and less harm from the measure than\r\nI could believe would follow.\r\n\r\n\"Yet, in repudiating it, I gave dissatisfaction, if not offense, to many\r\nwhose support the Country cannot afford to lose.  And this is not the\r\nend of it.  The pressure in this direction is still upon me, and is\r\nincreasing.  By conceding what I now ask, you can relieve me, and, much\r\nmore, can relieve the Country in this important point.\r\n\r\n\"Upon these considerations I have again begged your attention to the\r\nMessage of March last.  Before leaving the Capitol, consider and discuss\r\nit among yourselves.  You are Patriots and Statesmen, and as such I pray\r\nyou consider this proposition; and, at the least, commend it to the\r\nconsideration of your States and people.  As you would perpetuate\r\npopular Government for the best people in the World, I beseech you that\r\nyou do in nowise omit this.\r\n\r\n\"Our common Country is in great peril, demanding the loftiest views and\r\nboldest action to bring a speedy relief.  Once relieved, its form of\r\nGovernment is saved to the World, its beloved history and cherished\r\nmemories are vindicated, and its happy future fully assured and rendered\r\ninconceivable grand.  To you, more than to any others, the privilege is\r\ngiven to assure that happiness and swell that grandeur, and to link your\r\nown names therewith forever.\"\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen representing in Congress the Border-States, to whom this\r\naddress was made, subsequently met and discussed its subject matter, and\r\nmade written reply in the shape of majority and minority replies, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nTHE MAJORITY REPLY:\r\n\r\n\"WASHINGTON, July 14, 1862.\r\n\r\n\"TO THE PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned, Representatives of Kentucky, Virginia, Missouri, and\r\nMaryland, in the two Houses of Congress, have listened to your address\r\nwith the profound sensibility naturally inspired by the high source from\r\nwhich it emanates, the earnestness which marked its delivery, and the\r\noverwhelming importance of the subject of which it treats.  We have\r\ngiven it a most respectful consideration, and now lay before you our\r\nresponse.  We regret that want of time has not permitted us to make it\r\nmore perfect.\r\n\r\n\"We have not been wanting, Mr. President, in respect to you, and in\r\ndevotion to the Constitution and the Union.  We have not been\r\nindifferent to the great difficulties surrounding you, compared with\r\nwhich all former National troubles have been but as the summer cloud;\r\nand we have freely given you our sympathy and support.  Repudiating the\r\ndangerous heresies of the Secessionists, we believed, with you, that the\r\nWar on their part is aggressive and wicked, and the objects for which it\r\nwas to be prosecuted on ours, defined by your Message at the opening of\r\nthe present Congress, to be such as all good men should approve.\r\n\r\n\"We have not hesitated to vote all supplies necessary to carry it on\r\nvigorously.  We have voted all the men and money you have asked for, and\r\neven more; we have imposed onerous taxes on our people, and they are\r\npaying them with cheerfulness and alacrity; we have encouraged\r\nenlistments, and sent to the field many of our best men; and some of our\r\nnumber have offered their persons to the enemy as pledges of their\r\nsincerity and devotion to the Country.\r\n\r\n\"We have done all this under the most discouraging circumstances, and in\r\nthe face of measures most distasteful to us and injurious to the\r\ninterests we represent, and in the hearing of doctrines avowed by those\r\nwho claim to be your friends, must be abhorrent to us and our\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\n\"But, for all this, we have never faltered, nor shall we as long as we\r\nhave a Constitution to defend and a Government which protects us.  And\r\nwe are ready for renewed efforts, and even greater sacrifices, yea, any\r\nsacrifice, when we are satisfied it is required to preserve our\r\nadmirable form of Government and the priceless blessings of\r\nConstitutional Liberty.\r\n\r\n\"A few of our number voted for the Resolution recommended by your\r\nMessage of the 6th of March last, the greater portion of us did not, and\r\nwe will briefly state the prominent reasons which influenced our action.\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, it proposed a radical change of our social system,\r\nand was hurried through both Houses with undue haste, without reasonable\r\ntime for consideration and debate, and with no time at all for\r\nconsultation with our constituents, whose interests it deeply involved.\r\nIt seemed like an interference by this Government with a question which\r\npeculiarly and exclusively belonged to our respective States, on which\r\nthey had not sought advice or solicited aid.\r\n\r\n\"Many of us doubted the Constitutional power of this Government to make\r\nappropriations of money for the object designated, and all of us thought\r\nour finances were in no condition to bear the immense outlay which its\r\nadoption and faithful execution would impose upon the National Treasury.\r\nIf we pause but a moment to think of the debt its acceptance would have\r\nentailed, we are appalled by its magnitude.  The proposition was\r\naddressed to all the States, and embraced the whole number of Slaves.\r\n\r\n\"According to the census of 1860 there were then nearly four million\r\nSlaves in the Country; from natural increase they exceed that number\r\nnow.  At even the low average of $300, the price fixed by the\r\nEmancipation Act for the Slaves of this District, and greatly below\r\ntheir real worth, their value runs up to the enormous sum of\r\n$1,200,000,000; and if to that we add the cost of deportation and\r\ncolonization, at $100 each, which is but a fraction more than is\r\nactually paid--by the Maryland Colonization Society, we have\r\n$400,000,000 more.\r\n\r\n\"We were not willing to impose a tax on our people sufficient to pay the\r\ninterest on that sum, in addition to the vast and daily increasing debt\r\nalready fixed upon them by exigencies of the War, and if we had been\r\nwilling, the Country could not bear it.  Stated in this form the\r\nproposition is nothing less than the deportation from the Country of\r\n$1,600,000,000 worth of producing labor, and the substitution, in its\r\nplace, of an interest-bearing debt of the same amount.\r\n\r\n\"But, if we are told that it was expected that only the States we\r\nrepresent would accept the proposition, we respectfully submit that even\r\nthen it involves a sum too great for the financial ability of this\r\nGovernment at this time.  According to the census of 1860:\r\n\r\n                                   Slaves\r\n          Kentucky had ........... 225,490\r\n          Maryland ...............  87,188\r\n          Virginia ............... 490,887\r\n          Delaware ...............   1,798\r\n          Missouri ............... 114,965\r\n          Tennessee .............. 275,784\r\n\r\n          Making in the whole .. 1,196,112\r\n\r\n          At the same rate of valuation these would\r\n          amount to ......... $358,933,500\r\n\r\n          Add for deportation and colonization $100\r\n          each ............... 118,244,533\r\n\r\n          And we have the\r\n          enormous sum of ... $478,038,133\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We did not feel that we should be justified in voting for a measure\r\nwhich, if carried out, would add this vast amount to our public debt at\r\na moment when the Treasury was reeling under the enormous expenditure of\r\nthe War.\r\n\r\n\"Again, it seemed to us that this Resolution was but the annunciation of\r\na sentiment which could not or was not likely to be reduced to an actual\r\ntangible proposition.  No movement was then made to provide and\r\nappropriate the funds required to carry it into effect; and we were not\r\nencouraged to believe that funds would be provided.  And our belief has\r\nbeen fully justified by subsequent events.\r\n\r\n\"Not to mention other circumstances, it is quite sufficient for our\r\npurpose to bring to your notice the fact that, while this resolution was\r\nunder consideration in the Senate, our colleague, the Senator from\r\nKentucky, moved an amendment appropriating $500,000 to the object\r\ntherein designated, and it was voted down with great unanimity.\r\n\r\n\"What confidence, then, could we reasonably feel that if we committed\r\nourselves to the policy it proposed, our constituents would reap the\r\nfruits of the promise held out; and on what ground could we, as fair\r\nmen, approach them and challenge their support?\r\n\r\n\"The right to hold Slaves, is a right appertaining to all the States of\r\nthis Union.  They have the right to cherish or abolish the Institution,\r\nas their tastes or their interests may prompt, and no one is authorized\r\nto question the right or limit the enjoyment.  And no one has more\r\nclearly affirmed that right than you have.  Your Inaugural Address does\r\nyou great honor in this respect, and inspired the Country with\r\nconfidence in your fairness and respect for the Law.  Our States are in\r\nthe enjoyment of that right.\r\n\r\n\"We do not feel called on to defend the Institution or to affirm it is\r\none which ought to be cherished; perhaps, if we were to make the\r\nattempt, we might find that we differ even among ourselves.  It is\r\nenough for our purpose to know that it is a right; and, so knowing, we\r\ndid not see why we should now be expected to yield it.\r\n\r\n\"We had contributed our full share to relieve the Country at this\r\nterrible crisis; we had done as much as had been required of others in\r\nlike circumstances; and we did not see why sacrifices should be expected\r\nof us from which others, no more loyal, were exempt.  Nor could we see\r\nwhat good the Nation would derive from it.\r\n\r\n\"Such a sacrifice submitted to by us would not have strengthened the arm\r\nof this Government or weakened that of the Enemy.  It was not necessary\r\nas a pledge of our Loyalty, for that had been manifested beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt, in every form, and at every place possible.  There was\r\nnot the remotest probability that the States we represent would join in\r\nthe Rebellion, nor is there now, or of their electing to go with the\r\nSouthern Section in the event of a recognition of the Independence of\r\nany part of the disaffected region.\r\n\r\n\"Our States are fixed unalterably in their resolution to adhere to and\r\nsupport the Union.  They see no safety for themselves, and no hope for\r\nConstitutional Liberty, but by its preservation.  They will, under no\r\ncircumstances, consent to its dissolution; and we do them no more than\r\njustice when we assure you that, while the War is conducted to prevent\r\nthat deplorable catastrophe, they will sustain it as long as they can\r\nmuster a man, or command a dollar.\r\n\r\n\"Nor will they ever consent, in any event, to unite with the Southern\r\nConfederacy.  The bitter fruits of the peculiar doctrines of that region\r\nwill forever prevent them from placing their security and happiness in\r\nthe custody of an association which has incorporated in its Organic Law\r\nthe seeds of its own destruction.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot admit, Mr. President, that if we had voted for the Resolution\r\nin the Emancipation Message of March last, the War would now be\r\nsubstantially ended.  We are unable to see how our action in this\r\nparticular has given, or could give, encouragement to the Rebellion.\r\nThe Resolution has passed; and if there be virtue in it, it will be\r\nquite as efficacious as if we had voted for it.\r\n\r\n\"We have no power to bind our States in this respect by our votes here;\r\nand, whether we had voted the one way or the other, they are in the same\r\ncondition of freedom to accept or reject its provisions.\r\n\r\n\"No, Sir, the War has not been prolonged or hindered by our action on\r\nthis or any other measure.  We must look for other causes for that\r\nlamented fact.  We think there is not much difficulty, not much\r\nuncertainty, in pointing out others far more probable and potent in\r\ntheir agencies to that end.\r\n\r\n\"The Rebellion derives its strength from the Union of all classes in the\r\nInsurgent States; and while that Union lasts the War will never end\r\nuntil they are utterly exhausted.  We know that, at the inception of\r\nthese troubles, Southern society was divided, and that a large portion,\r\nperhaps a majority, were opposed to Secession.  Now the great mass of\r\nSouthern people are united.\r\n\r\n\"To discover why they are so, we must glance at Southern society, and\r\nnotice the classes into which it has been divided, and which still\r\ndistinguish it.  They are in arms, but not for the same objects; they\r\nare moved to a common end, but by different and even inconsistent\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n\"The leaders, which comprehend what was previously known as the State\r\nRights Party, and is much the lesser class, seek to break down National\r\nIndependence and set up State domination.  With them it is a War against\r\nNationality.\r\n\r\n\"The other class is fighting, as it supposes, to maintain and preserve\r\nits rights of Property and domestic safety, which it has been made to\r\nbelieve are assailed by this Government.  This latter class are not\r\nDisunionists per se; they are so only because they have been made to\r\nbelieve that this Administration is inimical to their rights, and is\r\nmaking War on their domestic Institutions.  As long as these two classes\r\nact together they will never assent to a Peace.\r\n\r\n\"The policy, then, to be pursued, is obvious.  The former class will\r\nnever be reconciled, but the latter may be.  Remove their apprehensions;\r\nsatisfy them that no harm is intended to them and their Institutions;\r\nthat this Government is not making War on their rights of Property, but\r\nis simply defending its legitimate authority, and they will gladly\r\nreturn to their allegiance as soon as the pressure of Military dominion\r\nimposed by the Confederate authority is removed from them.\r\n\r\n\"Twelve months ago, both Houses of Congress, adopting the spirit of your\r\nMessage, then but recently sent in, declared with singular unanimity the\r\nobjects of the War, and the Country instantly bounded to your side to\r\nassist you in carrying it on.  If the spirit of that Resolution had been\r\nadhered to, we are confident that we should before now have seen the end\r\nof this deplorable conflict.  But what have we seen?\r\n\r\n\"In both Houses of Congress we have heard doctrines subversive of the\r\nprinciples of the Constitution, and seen measure after measure, founded\r\nin substance on those doctrines, proposed and carried through, which can\r\nhave no other effect than to distract and divide loyal men, and\r\nexasperate and drive still further from us and their duty the people of\r\nthe rebellious States.\r\n\r\n\"Military officers, following these bad examples, have stepped beyond\r\nthe just limits of their authority in the same direction, until in\r\nseveral instances you have felt the necessity of interfering to arrest\r\nthem.  And even the passage of the Resolution to which you refer has\r\nbeen ostentatiously proclaimed as the triumph of a principle which the\r\npeople of the Southern States regard as ruinous to them.  The effect of\r\nthese measures was foretold, and may now be seen in the indurated state\r\nof Southern feeling.\r\n\r\n\"To these causes, Mr. President, and not to our omission to vote for the\r\nResolution recommended by you, we solemnly believe we are to attribute\r\nthe terrible earnestness of those in arms against the Government, and\r\nthe continuance of the War.  Nor do we (permit us to say, Mr. President,\r\nwith all respect to you) agree that the Institution of Slavery is 'the\r\nlever of their power,' but we are of the opinion that 'the lever of\r\ntheir power' is the apprehension that the powers of a common Government,\r\ncreated for common and equal protection to the interests of all, will be\r\nwielded against the Institutions of the Southern States.\r\n\r\n\"There is one other idea in your address we feel called on to notice.\r\nAfter stating the fact of your repudiation of General Hunter's\r\nProclamation, you add:\r\n\r\n\"'Yet, in repudiating it, I gave dissatisfaction, if not offense, to\r\nmany whose support the Country cannot afford to lose.  And this is not\r\nthe end of it.  The pressure in this direction is still upon me and is\r\nincreasing.  By conceding what I now ask, you can relieve me, and, much\r\nmore, can relieve the Country, in this important point,'\r\n\r\n\"We have anxiously looked into this passage to discover its true import,\r\nbut we are yet in painful uncertainty.  How can we, by conceding what\r\nyou now ask, relieve you and the Country from the increasing pressure to\r\nwhich you refer?  We will not allow ourselves to think that the\r\nproposition is, that we consent to give up Slavery, to the end that the\r\nHunter proclamation may be let loose on the Southern people, for it is\r\ntoo well known that we would not be parties to any such measure, and we\r\nhave too much respect for you to imagine you would propose it.\r\n\r\n\"Can it mean that by sacrificing our interest in Slavery we appease the\r\nspirit that controls that pressure, cause it to be withdrawn, and rid\r\nthe Country of the pestilent agitation of the Slavery question?  We are\r\nforbidden so to think, for that spirit would not be satisfied with the\r\nliberation of 100,000 Slaves, and cease its agitation while 3,000,000\r\nremain in bondage.  Can it mean that by abandoning Slavery in our States\r\nwe are removing the pressure from you and the Country, by preparing for\r\na separation on the line of the Cotton States?\r\n\r\n\"We are forbidden so to think, because it is known that we are, and we\r\nbelieve that you are, unalterably opposed to any division at all.  We\r\nwould prefer to think that you desire this concession as a pledge of our\r\nsupport, and thus enable you to withstand a pressure which weighs\r\nheavily on you and the Country.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, no such sacrifice is necessary to secure our support.\r\nConfine yourself to your Constitutional authority; confine your\r\nsubordinates within the same limits; conduct this War solely for the\r\npurpose of restoring the Constitution to its legitimate authority;\r\nconcede to each State and its loyal citizens their just rights, and we\r\nare wedded to you by indissoluble ties.  Do this, Mr. President, and you\r\ntouch the American heart, and invigorate it with new hope.  You will, as\r\nwe solemnly believe, in due time restore Peace to your Country, lift it\r\nfrom despondency to a future of glory, and preserve to your countrymen,\r\ntheir posterity, and man, the inestimable treasure of a Constitutional\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, we have stated with frankness and candor the reasons on\r\nwhich we forbore to vote for the Resolution you have mentioned; but you\r\nhave again presented this proposition, and appealed to us with an\r\nearnestness and eloquence which have not failed to impress us, to\r\n'consider it, and at the least to commend it to the consideration of our\r\nStates and people.'\r\n\r\n\"Thus appealed to by the Chief Magistrate of our beloved Country, in the\r\nhour of its greatest peril, we cannot wholly decline.  We are willing to\r\ntrust every question relating to their interest and happiness to the\r\nconsideration and ultimate judgment of our own people.\r\n\r\n\"While differing from you as to the necessity of Emancipating the Slaves\r\nof our States as a means of putting down the Rebellion, and while\r\nprotesting against the propriety of any extra-territorial interference\r\nto induce the people of our States to adopt any particular line of\r\npolicy on a subject which peculiarly and exclusively belongs to them,\r\nyet, when you and our brethren of the Loyal States sincerely believe\r\nthat the retention of Slavery by us is an obstacle to Peace and National\r\nharmony, and are willing to contribute pecuniary aid to compensate our\r\nStates and people for the inconveniences produced by such a change of\r\nsystem, we are not unwilling that our people shall consider the\r\npropriety of putting it aside.\r\n\r\n\"But we have already said that we regard this Resolution as the\r\nutterance of a sentiment, and we had no confidence that it would assume\r\nthe shape of a tangible practical proposition, which would yield the\r\nfruits of the sacrifice it required.  Our people are influenced by the\r\nsame want of confidence, and will not consider the proposition in its\r\npresent impalpable form.  The interest they are asked to give up is, to\r\nthem, of immense importance, and they ought not to be expected even to\r\nentertain the proposal until they are assured that when they accept it\r\ntheir just expectations will not be frustrated.\r\n\r\n\"We regard your plan as a proposition from the Nation to the States to\r\nexercise an admitted Constitutional right in a particular manner, and\r\nyield up a valuable interest.  Before they ought to consider the\r\nproposition, it should be presented in such a tangible, practical,\r\nefficient shape, as to command their confidence that its fruits are\r\ncontingent only upon their acceptance.  We cannot trust anything to the\r\ncontingencies of future legislation.\r\n\r\n\"If Congress, by proper and necessary legislation, shall provide\r\nsufficient funds and place them at your disposal to be applied by you to\r\nthe payment of any of our States, or the citizens thereof, who shall\r\nadopt the Abolishment of Slavery, either gradual or immediate, as they\r\nmay determine, and the expense of deportation and colonization of the\r\nliberated Slaves, then will our States and people take this proposition\r\ninto careful consideration, for such decision as in their judgment is\r\ndemanded by their interest, their honor, and their duty to the whole\r\nCountry.  We have the honor to be, with great respect,\r\n\r\n\"C. A. WICKLIFFE, Ch'man,\r\nCHAS. B. CALVERT,\r\nGARRETT DAVIS,\r\nC. L. L. LEARY,\r\nR. WILSON,\r\nEDWIN H. WEBSTER,\r\nJ. J. CRITTENDEN,\r\nR.

PRESIDENT:--The undersigned, members of Congress from the Border\r\nStates, in response to your address of Saturday last, beg leave to say\r\nthat they attended a meeting, on the same day the address was delivered,\r\nfor the purpose of considering the same.  The meeting appointed a\r\nCommittee to report a response to your address.  That report was made on\r\nyesterday, and the action of the majority indicated clearly that the\r\nresponse, or one in substance the same, would be adopted and presented\r\nto you.\r\n\r\n\"Inasmuch as we cannot, consistently with our own sense of duty to the\r\nCountry, under the existing perils which surround us, concur in that\r\nresponse, we feel it to be due to you and to ourselves to make to you a\r\nbrief and candid answer over our own signatures.\r\n\r\n\"We believe that the whole power of the Government, upheld and sustained\r\nby all the influences and means of all loyal men in all Sections, and of\r\nall Parties, is essentially necessary to put down the Rebellion and\r\npreserve the Union and the Constitution.  We understand your appeal to\r\nus to have been made for the purpose of securing this result.\r\n\r\n\"A very large portion of the People in the Northern States believe that\r\nSlavery is the 'lever-power of the Rebellion.'  It matters not whether\r\nthis belief be well-founded or not.  The belief does exist, and we have\r\nto deal with things as they are, and not as we would have them be.\r\n\r\n\"In consequence of the existence of this belief, we understand that an\r\nimmense pressure is brought to bear for the purpose of striking down\r\nthis Institution through the exercise of Military authority.  The\r\nGovernment cannot maintain this great struggle if the support and\r\ninfluence of the men who entertain these opinions be withdrawn.  Neither\r\ncan the Government hope for early success if the support of that element\r\ncalled \"Conservative\" be withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\"Such being the condition of things, the President appeals to the\r\nBorder-State men to step forward and prove their patriotism by making\r\nthe first sacrifice.  No doubt, like appeals have been made to extreme\r\nmen in the North to meet us half-way, in order that the whole moral,\r\npolitical, pecuniary, and physical force of the Nation may be firmly and\r\nearnestly united in one grand effort to save the Union and the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n\"Believing that such were the motives that prompted your Address, and\r\nsuch the results to which it looked, we cannot reconcile it to our sense\r\nof duty, in this trying hour, to respond in a spirit of fault-finding or\r\nquerulousness over the things that are past.\r\n\r\n\"We are not disposed to seek for the cause of present misfortunes in the\r\nerrors and wrongs of others who now propose to unite with us in a common\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\"But, on the other hand, we meet your address in the spirit in which it\r\nwas made, and, as loyal Americans, declare to you and to the World that\r\nthere is no sacrifice that we are not ready to make to save the\r\nGovernment and institutions of our fathers.  That we, few of us though\r\nthere may be, will permit no man, from the North or from the South, to\r\ngo further than we in the accomplishment of the great work before us.\r\nThat, in order to carry out these views, we will, so far as may be in\r\nour power, ask the people of the Border States calmly, deliberately, and\r\nfairly to consider your recommendations.\r\n\r\n\"We are the more emboldened to assume this position from the fact, now\r\nbecome history, that the leaders of the Southern Rebellion have offered\r\nto abolish Slavery among them as a condition to foreign intervention in\r\nfavor of their Independence as a Nation.\r\n\r\n\"If they can give up Slavery to destroy the Union, we can surely ask our\r\npeople to consider the question of Emancipation to save the Union.\r\n\r\n\"With great respect, your obedient servants,\r\n\r\n\"JOHN W. NOELL,\r\n\"SAMUEL L. CASEY,\r\n\"GEORGE P. FISHER,\r\n\"A. J. CLEMENTS,\r\n\"WILLIAM G. BROWN,\r\n\"JACOB B. BLAIR,\r\n\"W. T. WILLEY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     [The following separate replies, subsequently made, by\r\n     Representative Maynard of Tennessee, and Senator Henderson of\r\n     Missouri, are necessarily given to complete this part of the Border\r\n     State record.]\r\n\r\n                           MR. MAYNARD'S REPLY.\r\n\r\n\"HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, July 16, 1862.\r\n\r\n\"SIR:--The magnitude and gravity of the proposition submitted by you to\r\nRepresentatives from the Slave States would naturally occasion\r\ndiversity, if not contrariety, of opinion.  You will not, therefore, be\r\nsurprised that I have not been able to concur in view with the majority\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n\"This is attributable, possibly, to the fact that my State is not a\r\nBorder State, properly so called, and that my immediate constituents are\r\nnot yet disenthralled from the hostile arms of the Rebellion.  This fact\r\nis a physical obstacle in the way of my now submitting to their\r\nconsideration this, or any other proposition looking to political\r\naction, especially such as, in this case, would require a change in the\r\nOrganic Law of the State.\r\n\r\n\"But do not infer that I am insensible to your appeal.  I am not; you\r\nare surrounded with difficulties far greater than have embarrassed any\r\nof your predecessors.  You need the support of every American citizen,\r\nand you ought to have it--active, zealous and honest.  The union of all\r\nUnion men to aid you in preserving the Union, is the duty of the time.\r\nDifferences as to policy and methods must be subordinated to the common\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\"In looking for the cause of this Rebellion, it is natural that each\r\nSection and each Party should ascribe as little blame as possible to\r\nitself, and as much as possible to its opponent Section and Party.\r\nPossibly you and I might not agree on a comparison of our views.  That\r\nthere should be differences of opinion as to the best mode of conducting\r\nour Military operations, and the best men to lead our Armies, is equally\r\nnatural.  Contests on such questions weaken ourselves and strengthen our\r\nenemies.  They are unprofitable, and possibly unpatriotic.  Somebody\r\nmust yield, or we waste our strength in a contemptible struggle among\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n\"You appeal to the loyal men of the Slave States to sacrifice something\r\nof feeling and a great deal of interest.  The sacrifices they have\r\nalready made and the sufferings they have endured give the best\r\nassurance that the appeal will not have been made in vain.  He who is\r\nnot ready to yield all his material interests, and to forego his most\r\ncherished sentiments and opinions for the preservation of his Country,\r\nalthough he may have periled his life on the battle-field in her\r\ndefense, is but half a Patriot.  Among the loyal people that I\r\nrepresent, there are no half-patriots.\r\n\r\n\"Already the Rebellion has cost us much, even to our undoing; we are\r\ncontent, if need be, to give up the rest, to suppress it.  We have stood\r\nby you from the beginning of this struggle, and we mean to stand by you,\r\nGod willing, till the end of it.\r\n\r\n\"I did not vote for the Resolution to which you allude, solely for the\r\nreason that I was absent at the Capital of my own State.  It is right.\r\n\r\n\"Should any of the Slave States think proper to terminate that\r\nInstitution, as several of them, I understand, or at least some of their\r\ncitizens propose, justice and a generous comity require that the Country\r\nshould interpose to aid in lessening the burden, public and private,\r\noccasioned by so radical a change in its social and industrial\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n\"I will not now speculate upon the effect, at home or abroad, of the\r\nadoption of your policy, nor inquire what action of the Rebel leaders\r\nhas rendered something of the kind important.  Your whole administration\r\ngives the highest assurance that you are moved, not so much from a\r\ndesire to see all men everywhere made free, as from a higher desire to\r\npreserve free institutions for the benefit of men already free; not to\r\nmake Slaves, Freemen, but to prevent Freemen from being made Slaves; not\r\nto destroy an Institution, which a portion of us only consider bad, but\r\nto save institutions which we all alike consider good.  I am satisfied\r\nyou would not ask from any of your fellow-citizens a sacrifice not, in\r\nyour judgment, imperatively required by the safety of the Country.\r\n\r\n\"This is the spirit of your appeal, and I respond to it in the same\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n\"I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                              \"HORACE MAYNARD.\r\n\r\n\"To the PRESIDENT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SENATOR HENDERSON'S REPLY.\r\n\r\n\"WASHINGTON CITY, July 21, 1862.\r\n\r\n\"MR. PRESIDENT:--The pressure of business in the Senate during the last\r\nfew days of the session prevented my attendance at the meeting of the\r\nBorder-State members, called to consider your proposition in reference\r\nto gradual emancipation in our States.\r\n\r\n\"It is for this reason only, and not because I fail to appreciate their\r\nimportance or properly respect your suggestions, that my name does not\r\nappear to any of the several papers submitted in response.  I may also\r\nadd that it was my intention, when the subject came up practically for\r\nconsideration in the Senate, to express fully my views in regard to it.\r\nThis of course would have rendered any other response unnecessary.  But\r\nthe want of time to consider the matter deprived me of that opportunity,\r\nand, lest now my silence be misconstrued, I deem it proper to say to you\r\nthat I am by no means indifferent to the great questions so earnestly,\r\nand as I believe so honestly, urged by you upon our consideration.\r\n\r\n\"The Border States, so far, are the chief sufferers by this War, and the\r\ntrue Union men of those States have made the greatest sacrifices for the\r\npreservation of the Government.  This fact does not proceed from\r\nmismanagement on the part of the Union authorities, or a want of regard\r\nfor our people, but it is the necessary result of the War that is upon\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\"Our States are the battle-fields.  Our people, divided among\r\nthemselves, maddened by the struggle, and blinded by the smoke of\r\nbattle, invited upon our soil contending armies--the one to destroy the\r\nGovernment, the other to maintain it.  The consequence to us is plain.\r\nThe shock of the contest upturns Society and desolates the Land.  We\r\nhave made sacrifices, but at last they were only the sacrifices demanded\r\nby duty, and unless we are willing to make others, indeed any that the\r\ngood of the Country, involved in the overthrow of Treason, may expect at\r\nour hands, our title to patriotism is not complete.\r\n\r\n\"When you submitted your proposition to Congress, in March last, 'that\r\nthe United States ought to co-operate with any State which may adopt a\r\ngradual abolishment of Slavery, giving to such State pecuniary aid, to\r\nbe used by such State in its discretion, to compensate for the\r\ninconveniences, public and private, produced by such change of system,'\r\nI gave it a most cheerful support, and I am satisfied it would have\r\nreceived the approbation of a large majority of the Border States\r\ndelegations in both Branches of Congress, if, in the first place, they\r\nhad believed the War, with its continued evils--the most prominent of\r\nwhich, in a material point of view, is its injurious effect on the\r\nInstitution of Slavery in our States--could possibly have been\r\nprotracted for another twelve months; and if, in the second place, they\r\nhad felt assured that the party having the majority in Congress would,\r\nlike yourself, be equally prompt in practical action as in the\r\nexpression of a sentiment.\r\n\r\n\"While scarcely any one doubted your own sincerity in the premises, and\r\nyour earnest wish speedily to terminate the War, you can readily\r\nconceive the grounds for difference of opinion where conclusions could\r\nonly be based on conjecture.\r\n\r\n\"Believing, as I did, that the War was not so near its termination as\r\nsome supposed, and feeling disposed to accord to others the same\r\nsincerity of purpose that I should claim for myself under similar\r\ncircumstances, I voted for the proposition.  I will suppose that others\r\nwere actuated by no sinister motives.\r\n\r\n\"In doing so, Mr. President, I desire to be distinctly understood by you\r\nand by my constituents.  I did not suppose at the time that I was\r\npersonally making any sacrifice by supporting the Resolution, nor that\r\nthe people of my State were called upon to make any sacrifices, either\r\nin considering or accepting the proposition, if they saw fit.\r\n\r\n\"I agreed with you in the remarks contained in the Message accompanying\r\nthe Resolution, that 'the Union must be preserved, and hence all\r\nindispensable means must be employed.  * * * War has been and continues\r\nto be an indispensable means to this end.  A practical reacknowledgment\r\nof the National authority would render the War unnecessary, and it would\r\nat once cease.  If, however, resistance continues, the War must also\r\ncontinue; and it is impossible to foresee all the incidents which may\r\nattend and all the ruin which may follow it.'\r\n\r\n\"It is truly 'impossible' to foresee all the evils resulting from a War\r\nso stupendous as the present.  I shall be much rejoiced if something\r\nmore dreadful than the sale of Freedom to a few Slaves in the Border\r\nStates shall not result from it.\r\n\r\n\"If it closes with the Government of our Fathers secure, and\r\nConstitutional Liberty in all its purity guaranteed to the White man,\r\nthe result will be better than that having a place in the fears of many\r\ngood men at present, and much better than the past history of such\r\nrevolutions can justify us in expecting.\r\n\r\n\"In this period of the Nation's distress, I know of no human institution\r\ntoo sacred for discussion; no material interest belonging to the citizen\r\nthat he should not willingly place upon the altar of his Country, if\r\ndemanded by the public good.\r\n\r\n\"The man who cannot now sacrifice Party and put aside selfish\r\nconsiderations is more than half disloyal.  Such a man does not deserve\r\nthe blessings of good government.  Pride of opinion, based upon\r\nSectional jealousies, should not be permitted to control the decision of\r\nany political question.  These remarks are general, but apply with\r\npeculiar force to the People of the Border States at present.\r\n\r\n\"Let us look at our condition.  A desolating War is upon us.  We cannot\r\nescape it if we would.  If the Union Armies were to-day withdrawn from\r\nthe Border States without first crushing the Rebellion in the South, no\r\nrational man can doubt for a moment that the adherents of the Union\r\nCause in those States would soon be driven in exile from their homes by\r\nthe exultant Rebels, who have so long hoped to return and take vengeance\r\nupon us.\r\n\r\n\"The People of the Border States understand very well the unfriendly and\r\nselfish spirit exercised toward them by the leaders of this Cotton-State\r\nRebellion, beginning some time previous to its outbreak.  They will not\r\nfail to remember their insolent refusal to counsel with us, and their\r\nhaughty assumption of responsibility upon themselves for their misguided\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\"Our people will not soon forget that, while declaiming against\r\nCoercion, they closed their doors against the exportation of Slaves from\r\nthe Border States into the South, with the avowed purpose of forcing us\r\ninto Rebellion through fears of losing that species of Property.  They\r\nknew very well the effect to be produced on Slavery by a Civil War,\r\nespecially in those States into which hostile Armies might penetrate,\r\nand upon the soil of which the great contests for the success of\r\nRepublican Government were to be decided.\r\n\r\n\"They wanted some intermediate ground for the conflict of arms-territory\r\nwhere the population would be divided.  They knew, also, that by keeping\r\nSlavery in the Border States the mere 'friction and abrasion' to which\r\nyou so appropriately allude, would keep up a constant irritation,\r\nresulting necessarily from the frequent losses to which the owners would\r\nbe subjected.\r\n\r\n\"They also calculated largely, and not without reason, upon the\r\nrepugnance of Non-Slaveholders in those States to a Free Negro\r\npopulation.  In the meantime they intended persistently to charge the\r\noverthrow of Slavery to be the object of the Government, and hostility\r\nto this Institution the origin of the War.  By this means the\r\nunavoidable incidents of the strife might easily he charged as the\r\nsettled purposes of the Government.\r\n\r\n\"Again, it was well understood, by these men, that exemplary conduct on\r\nthe part of every officer and soldier employed by the Government could\r\nnot in the nature of things be expected, and the hope was entertained,\r\nupon the most reasonable grounds, that every commission of wrong and\r\nevery omission of duty would produce a new cause for excitement and a\r\nnew incentive to Rebellion.\r\n\r\n\"By these means the War was to be kept in the Border States, regardless\r\nof our interests, until an exhausted Treasury should render it necessary\r\nto send the tax-gatherer among our people, to take the little that might\r\nbe left them from the devastations of War.\r\n\r\n\"They then expected a clamor for Peace by us, resulting in the\r\ninterference of France and England, whose operatives in the meantime\r\nwould be driven to want, and whose aristocracy have ever been ready to\r\nwelcome a dissolution of the American Union.\r\n\r\n\"This cunningly-devised plan for securing a Gulf-Confederacy, commanding\r\nthe mouths of the great Western rivers, the Gulf of Mexico, and the\r\nSouthern Atlantic ocean, with their own territory unscathed by the\r\nhorrors of war, and surrounded by the Border States, half of whose\r\npopulation would be left in sympathy with them, for many years to come,\r\nowing to the irritations to which I have alluded, has, so far, succeeded\r\ntoo well.\r\n\r\n\"In Missouri they have already caused us to lose a third or more of the\r\nSlaves owned at the time of the last census.  In addition to this, I can\r\nmake no estimate of the vast amount of property of every character that\r\nhas been destroyed by Military operations in the State.  The loss from\r\ngeneral depreciation of values, and the utter prostration of every\r\nbusiness-interest of our people, is wholly beyond calculation.\r\n\r\n\"The experience of Missouri is but the experience of other Sections of\r\nthe Country similarly situated.  The question is therefore forced upon\r\nus, 'How long is this War to continue; and, if continued, as it has\r\nbeen, on our soil, aided by the Treason and folly of our own citizens,\r\nacting in concert with the Confederates, how long can Slavery, or, if\r\nyou please, any other property-interest, survive in our States?'\r\n\r\n\"As things now are, the people of the Border-States yet divided, we\r\ncannot expect an immediate termination of the struggle, except upon\r\ncondition of Southern Independence, losing thereby control of the lower\r\nMississippi.  For this, we in Missouri are not prepared, nor are we\r\nprepared to become one of the Confederate States, should the terrible\r\ncalamity of Dissolution occur.\r\n\r\n\"This, I presume, the Union men of Missouri would resist to the death.\r\nAnd whether they should do so or not, I will not suppose for an instant,\r\nthat the Government of the United States would, upon any condition,\r\nsubmit to the loss of territory so essential to its future commercial\r\ngreatness as is the State of Missouri.\r\n\r\n\"But should all other reasons fail to prevent such a misfortune to our\r\npeople of Missouri, there is one that cannot fail.  The Confederates\r\nnever wanted us, and would not have us.  I assume, therefore, that the\r\nWar will not cease, but will be continued until the Rebellion shall be\r\novercome.  It cannot and will not cease, so far as the people of\r\nMissouri are concerned, except upon condition of our remaining in the\r\nUnion, and the whole West will demand the entire control of the\r\nMississippi river to the Gulf.\r\n\r\n\"Our interest is therefore bound up with the interests of those States\r\nmaintaining the Union, and especially with the great States of the West\r\nthat must be consulted in regard to the terms of any Peace that may be\r\nsuggested, even by the Nations of Europe, should they at any time\r\nunfortunately depart from their former pacific policy and determine to\r\nintervene in our affairs.\r\n\r\n\"The War, then, will have to be continued until the Union shall be\r\npractically restored.  In this alone consists the future safety of the\r\nBorder-States themselves.  A separation of the Union is ruinous to them.\r\nThe preservation of the Union can only be secured by a continuation of\r\nthe War.  The consequences of that continuation may be judged of by the\r\nexperience of the last twelve months.  The people of my State are as\r\ncompetent to pass judgment in the premises as I am.  I have every\r\nconfidence in their intelligence, their honesty, and their patriotism.\r\n\r\n\"In your own language, the proposition you make 'sets up no claim of a\r\nright by Federal authority to interfere with Slavery within State\r\nlimits,' referring, as it does, the absolute control of the subject in\r\neach case to the State and its people immediately interested.  It is\r\nproposed as a matter of perfectly free choice with them.\r\n\r\n\"In this view of the subject I can frankly say to you that, personally,\r\nI never could appreciate the objections so frequently urged against the\r\nproposition.  If I understood you properly, it was your opinion, not\r\nthat Slavery should be removed in order to secure our loyalty to the\r\nGovernment, for every personal act of your administration precludes such\r\nan inference, but you believe that the peculiar species of Property was\r\nin imminent danger from the War in which we were engaged, and that\r\ncommon justice demanded remuneration for the loss of it.\r\n\r\n\"You then believe, and again express the opinion, that the peculiar\r\nnature of the contest is such that its loss is almost inevitable, and\r\nlest any pretext for a charge of injustice against the Government be\r\ngiven to its enemies, you propose to extend to the people of those\r\nStates standing by the Union, the choice of payment for their Slaves or\r\nthe responsibility of loss, should it occur, without complaint against\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n\"Placing the matter in this light, (a mere remuneration for losses\r\nrendered inevitable by the casualties of War), the objection of a\r\nConstitutional character may be rendered much less formidable in the\r\nminds of Northern Representatives whose constituents will have to share\r\nin the payment of the money; and, so far as the Border States are\r\nconcerned, this objection should be most sparingly urged, for it being a\r\nmatter entirely of their 'own free choice,' in case of a desire to\r\naccept, no serious argument will likely be urged against the receipt of\r\nthe money, or a fund for Colonization.\r\n\r\n\"But, aside from the power derived from the operations of war, there may\r\nbe found numerous precedents in the legislation of the past, such as\r\ngrants of land and money to the several States for specified objects\r\ndeemed worthy by the Federal Congress.  And in addition to this may be\r\ncited a deliberate opinion of Mr. Webster upon this very subject, in one\r\nof the ablest arguments of his life.\r\n\r\n\"I allude to this question of power merely in vindication of the\r\nposition assumed by me in my vote for the Resolution of March last.\r\n\r\n\"In your last communication to us, you beg of us 'to commend this\r\nsubject to the consideration of our States and people.'  While I\r\nentirely differ with you in the opinion expressed, that had the members\r\nfrom the Border States approved of your Resolution of March last 'the\r\nWar would now be substantially ended,' and while I do not regard the\r\nsuggestion 'as one of the most potent and swift means of ending' the\r\nWar, I am yet free to say that I have the most unbounded confidence in\r\nyour sincerity of purpose in calling our attention to the dangers\r\nsurrounding us.\r\n\r\n\"I am satisfied that you appreciate the troubles of the Border States,\r\nand that your suggestions are intended for our good.  I feel the force\r\nof your urgent appeal, and the logic of surrounding circumstances brings\r\nconviction even to an unwilling believer.\r\n\r\n\"Having said that, in my judgment, you attached too much importance to\r\nthis measure as a means for suppressing the Rebellion, it is due to you\r\nthat I shall explain.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever may be the status of the Border States in this respect, the\r\nWar cannot be ended until the power of the Government is made manifest\r\nin the seceded States.  They appealed to the sword; give them the sword.\r\nThey asked for War; let them see its evils on their own soil.\r\n\r\n\"They have erected a Government, and they force obedience to its\r\nbehests.  This structure must be destroyed; this image, before which an\r\nunwilling People have been compelled to bow, must be broken.  The\r\nauthority of the Federal Government must be felt in the heart of the\r\nrebellious district.  To do this, let armies be marched upon them at\r\nonce, and let them feel what they have inflicted on us in the Border.\r\nDo not fear our States; we will stand by the Government in this work.\r\n\r\n\"I ought not to disguise from you or the people of my State, that\r\npersonally I have fixed and unalterable opinions on the subject of your\r\ncommunication.  Those opinions I shall communicate to the people in that\r\nspirit of frankness that should characterize the intercourse of the\r\nRepresentative with his constituents.\r\n\r\n\"If I were to-day the owner of the lands and Slaves of Missouri, your\r\nproposition, so far as that State is concerned, would be immediately\r\naccepted.  Not a day would be lost.  Aside from public considerations,\r\nwhich you suppose to be involved in the proposition, and which no\r\nPatriot, I agree, should disregard at present, my own personal interest\r\nwould prompt favorable and immediate action.\r\n\r\n\"But having said this, it is proper that I say something more.  The\r\nRepresentative is the servant and not the master of the People.  He has\r\nno authority to bind them to any course of action, or even to indicate\r\nwhat they will, or will not, do when the subject is exclusively theirs\r\nand not his.\r\n\r\n\"I shall take occasion, I hope honestly, to give my views of existing\r\ntroubles and impending dangers, and shall leave the rest to them,\r\ndisposed, as I am, rather to trust their judgment upon the case stated\r\nthan my own, and at the same time most cheerfully to acquiesce in their\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n\"For you, personally, Mr. President, I think I can pledge the kindest\r\nconsiderations of the people of Missouri, and I shall not hesitate to\r\nexpress the belief that your recommendation will be considered by them\r\nin the same spirit of kindness manifested by you in its presentation to\r\nus, and that their decision will be such as is demanded 'by their\r\ninterests, their honor, and their duty to the whole Country.'\r\n\r\n\"I am very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                              \"J. B. HENDERSON.\r\n\r\n\"To his Excellency,\r\n\"A. LINCOLN, PRESIDENT.\"",
