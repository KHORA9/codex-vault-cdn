We have begun obscurely to recognize that things\r\n   do not go of themselves, and that popular government is not in\r\n   itself a panacea, is no better than any other form except as the\r\n   virtue and wisdom of the people make it so, and that when men\r\n   undertake to do their own kingship, they enter upon, the dangers and\r\n   responsibilities as well as the privileges of the function. Above\r\n   all, it looks as if we were on the way to be persuaded that no\r\n   government can be carried on by declamation.\"\r\n\r\n                 --JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nFirst I am to write a love-story of long ago, of a time some little while\r\nafter General Jackson had got into the White House and had shown the\r\nworld what a real democracy was. The Era of the first six Presidents had\r\nclosed, and a new Era had begun. I am speaking of political Eras. Certain\r\ngentlemen, with a pious belief in democracy, but with a firmer\r\ndetermination to get on top, arose,--and got in top. So many of these\r\ngentlemen arose in the different states, and they were so clever, and\r\nthey found so many chinks in the Constitution to crawl through and steal\r\nthe people's chestnuts, that the Era may be called the Boss-Era. After\r\nthe Boss came along certain Things without souls, but of many minds, and\r\nfound more chinks in the Constitution: bigger chinks, for the Things were\r\nbigger, and they stole more chestnuts. But I am getting far ahead of my\r\nlove-story--and of my book.\r\n\r\nThe reader is warned that this first love-story will, in a few chapters,\r\ncome to an end: and not to a happy end--otherwise there would be no book.\r\nLest he should throw the book away when he arrives at this page, it is\r\nonly fair to tell him that there is another and a much longer love story\r\nlater on, if he will only continue to read, in which, it is hoped, he may\r\nnot be disappointed.\r\n\r\nThe hills seem to leap up against the sky as I describe that region where\r\nCynthia Ware was born, and the very old country names help to summon up\r\nthe picture. Coniston Mountain, called by some the Blue Mountain, clad in\r\nHercynian forests, ten good miles in length, north and south, with its\r\nnotch road that winds over the saddle behind the withers of it. Coniston\r\nWater, that oozes out from under the loam in a hundred places, on the\r\neastern slope, gathers into a rushing stream to cleave the very granite,\r\nflows southward around the south end of Coniston Mountain, and having\r\nturned the mills at Brampton, idles through meadows westward in its own\r\ngreen valley until it comes to Harwich, where it works again and tumbles\r\ninto a river. Brampton and Harwich are rivals, but Coniston Water gives\r\nof its power impartially to each. From the little farm clearings on the\r\nwestern slope of Coniston Mountain you can sweep the broad valley of a\r\ncertain broad river where grew (and grow still) the giant pines that gave\r\nmany a mast to King George's navy as tribute for the land. And beyond\r\nthat river rises beautiful Farewell Mountain of many colors, now\r\nsapphire, now amethyst, its crest rimmed about at evening with saffron\r\nflame; and, beyond Farewell, the emerald billows of the western peaks\r\ncatching the level light. A dozen little brooks are born high among the\r\nwestern spruces on Coniston to score deep, cool valleys in their way\r\nthrough Clovelly township to the broad music of the water and fresh\r\nriver-valleys full of the music of the water and fresh with the odor of\r\nthe ferns.\r\n\r\nTo this day the railroad has not reached Coniston Village--nay, nor\r\nConiston Flat, four miles nearer Brampton. The village lies on its own\r\nlittle shelf under the forest-clad slope of the mountain, and in the\r\nmidst of its dozen houses is the green triangle where the militia used to\r\ndrill on June days. At one end of the triangle is the great pine mast\r\nthat graced no frigate of George's, but flew the stars and stripes on\r\nmany a liberty day. Across the road is Jonah Winch's store, with a\r\nplatform so high that a man may step off his horse directly on to it;\r\nwith its checker-paned windows, with its dark interior smelling of coffee\r\nand apples and molasses, yes, and of Endea rum--for this was before the\r\ndays of the revivals.\r\n\r\nHow those checker-paned windows bring back the picture of that village\r\ngreen! The meeting-house has them, lantern-like, wide and high, in three\r\nsashes--white meeting-house, seat alike of government and religion, with\r\nits terraced steeple, with its classic porches north and south. Behind it\r\nis the long shed, and in front, rising out of the milkweed and the\r\nflowering thistle, the horse block of the first meeting-house, where many\r\na pillion has left its burden in times bygone. Honest Jock Hallowell\r\nbuilt that second meeting-house--was, indeed, still building it at the\r\ntime of which we write. He had hewn every beam and king post in it, and\r\nset every plate and slip. And Jock Hallowell is the man who, unwittingly\r\nstarts this chronicle.\r\n\r\nAt noon, on one of those madcap April days of that Coniston country, Jock\r\ndescended from his work on the steeple to perceive the ungainly figure of\r\nJethro Bass coming toward him across the green. Jethro was about thirty\r\nyears of age, and he wore a coonskin cap even in those days, and trousers\r\ntacked into his boots. He carried his big head bent forward, a little to\r\none aide, and was not, at first sight, a prepossessing-looking person. As\r\nour story largely concerns him and we must get started somehow, it may as\r\nwell be to fix a little attention on him.\r\n\r\n\"Heigho!\" said Jock, rubbing his hands on his leather apron.\r\n\r\n\"H-how be you, Jock?\" said Jethro, stopping.\r\n\r\n\"Heigho!\" cried Jock, \"what's this game of fox and geese you're a-playin'\r\namong the farmers?\"\r\n\r\n\"C-callate to git the steeple done before frost?\" inquired Jethro,\r\nwithout so much as a smile. \"B-build it tight, Jock--b-build it tight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess he'll build his'n tight, whatever it is,\" said Jock, looking after\r\nhim as Jethro made his way to the little tannery near by.\r\n\r\nLet it be known that there was such a thing as social rank in Coniston;\r\nand something which, for the sake of an advantageous parallel, we may\r\ncall an Established Church. Coniston was a Congregational town still, and\r\nthe deacons and dignitaries of that church were likewise the pillars of\r\nthe state. Not many years before the time of which we write actual\r\ndisestablishment had occurred, when the town ceased--as a town--to pay\r\nthe salary of Priest Ware, as the minister was called. The father of\r\nJethro Bass, Nathan the currier, had once, in a youthful lapse, permitted\r\na Baptist preacher to immerse him in Coniston Water. This had been the\r\nextent of Nathan's religion; Jethro had none at all, and was, for this\r\nand other reasons, somewhere near the bottom of the social scale.\r\n\r\n\"Fox and geese!\" repeated Jock, with his eyes still on Jethro's\r\nretreating back. The builder of the meetinghouse rubbed a great, brown\r\narm, scratched his head, and turned and came face to face with Cynthia\r\nWare, in a poke bonnet.\r\n\r\nContrast is a favorite trick of authors, and no greater contrast is to be\r\nhad in Coniston than that between Cynthia Ware and Jethro Bass. In the\r\nfirst place; Cynthia was the minister's daughter, and twenty-one. I can\r\nsummon her now under the great maples of the village street, a virginal\r\nfigure, gray eyes that kindled the face shaded by the poke bonnet, and up\r\nyou went above the clouds.\r\n\r\n\"What about fox and geese, Jock?\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"Jethro Bass,\" said Jock, who, by reason of his ability, was a privileged\r\ncharacter. \"Mark my words, Cynthy, Jethro Bass is an all-fired sight\r\nsmarter that folks in this town think he be. They don't take notice of\r\nhim, because he don't say much, and stutters. He hain't be'n eddicated a\r\ngreat deal, but I wouldn't be afeard to warrant he'd make a racket in the\r\nworld some of these days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jock Hallowell!\" cried Cynthia, the gray beginning to dance, \"I suppose\r\nyou think Jethro's going to be President.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Jock, \"you can laugh. Ever talked with Jethro?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've hardly spoken two words to him in my life,\" she replied. And it was\r\ntrue, although the little white parsonage was scarce two hundred yards\r\nfrom the tannery house.\r\n\r\n\"Jethro's never ailed much,\" Jock remarked, having reference to Cynthia's\r\nproclivities for visiting the sick. \"I've seed a good many different men\r\nin my time, and I tell you, Cynthia Ware, that Jethro's got a kind of\r\npower you don't often come acrost. Folks don't suspicion it.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of herself, Cynthia was impressed by the ring of sincerity in\r\nthe builder's voice. Now that she thought of it, there was rugged power\r\nin Jethro's face, especially when he took off the coonskin cap. She\r\nalways nodded a greeting when she saw him in the tannery yard or on the\r\nroad, and sometimes he nodded back, but oftener he had not appeared to\r\nsee her. She had thought this failure to nod stupidity, but it might\r\nafter all be abstraction.\r\n\r\n\"What makes you think he has ability?\" she asked, picking flowers from a\r\nbunch of arbutus she held.\r\n\r\n\"He's rich, for one thing,\" said Jock. He had not intended a dissertation\r\non Jethro Bass, but he felt bound to defend his statements.\r\n\r\n\"Rich!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, he hain't poor. He's got as many as thirty mortgages round among\r\nthe farmers--some on land, and some on cattle.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did he make the money?\" demanded Cynthia, in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Hides an' wool an' bark--turned 'em over an' swep' in. Gits a load, and\r\nLyman Hull drives him down to Boston with that six-hoss team. Lyman gits\r\ndrunk, Jethro keeps sober and saves.\"\r\n\r\nJock began to fashion some wooden pegs with his adze, for nails were\r\nscarce in those days. Still Cynthia lingered, picking flowers from the\r\nbunch.\r\n\r\n\"What did you mean by 'fox and geese' Jock?\" she said presently.\r\n\r\nJock laughed. He did not belong to the Establishment, but was a\r\nUniversalist; politically he admired General Jackson. \"What'd you say if\r\nJethro was Chairman of the next Board of Selectmen?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\nNo wonder Cynthia gasped. Jethro Bass, Chairman of the Board, in the\r\nhonored seat of Deacon Moses Hatch, the perquisite of the church in\r\nConiston! The idea was heresy. As a matter of fact, Jock himself uttered\r\nit as a playful exaggeration. Certain nonconformist farmers, of whom\r\nthere were not a few in the town, had come into Jonah Winch's store that\r\nmorning; and Jabez Miller, who lived on the north slope, had taken away\r\nthe breath of the orthodox by suggesting that Jethro Bass be nominated\r\nfor town office. Jock Hallowell had paused once or twice on his work on\r\nthe steeple to look across the tree-tops at Coniston shouldering the sky.\r\nHe had been putting two and two together, and now he was merely making\r\nfive out of it, instead of four. He remembered that Jethro Bass had for\r\nsome years been journeying through the town, baying his hides and wool,\r\nand collecting the interest on his mortgages.\r\n\r\nCynthia would have liked to reprove Jock Hallowell, and tell him there\r\nwere some subjects which should not be joked about. Jethro Bass, Chairman\r\nof the Board of Selectmen!\r\n\r\n\"Well, here comes, young Moses, I do believe,\" said Jock, gathering his\r\npegs into his apron and preparing to ascend once more. \"Callated he'd\r\nspring up pretty soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jock, you do talk foolishly for a man who is able to build a church,\"\r\nsaid Cynthia, as she walked away. The young Moses referred to was Moses\r\nHatch, Junior, son of the pillar of the Church and State, and it was an\r\nopen secret that he was madly in love with Cynthia. Let it be said of him\r\nthat he was a steady-going young man, and that he sighed for the moon.\r\n\r\n\"Moses,\" said the girl, when they came in sight of the elms that, shaded\r\nthe gable of the parsonage, \"what do you think of Jethro Bass?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jethro Bass!\" exclaimed honest Moses, \"whatever put him into your head,\r\nCynthy?\" Had she mentioned perhaps, any other young man in Coniston,\r\nMoses would have been eaten with jealousy.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jock was joking about him. What do you think of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never thought one way or t'other,\" he answered. \"Jethro never had much\r\nto do with the boys. He's always in that tannery, or out buyin' of hides.\r\nHe does make a sharp bargain when he buys a hide. We always goes shares\r\non our'n.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia was not only the minister's daughter,--distinction enough,--her\r\nreputation for learning was spread through the country roundabout, and at\r\nthe age of twenty she had had an offer to teach school in Harwich. Once a\r\nweek in summer she went to Brampton, to the Social library there, and sat\r\nat the feet of that Miss Lucretia Penniman of whom Brampton has ever been\r\nso proud--Lucretia Penniman, one of the first to sound the clarion note\r\nfor the intellectual independence of American women; who wrote the \"Hymn\r\nto Coniston\"; who, to the awe of her townspeople, went out into the great\r\nworld and became editress of a famous woman's journal, and knew\r\nLongfellow and Hawthorne and Bryant. Miss Lucretia it was who started the\r\nBrampton Social Library, and filled it with such books as both sexes\r\nmight read with profit. Never was there a stricter index than hers.\r\nCynthia, Miss Lucretia loved, and the training of that mind was the\r\npleasantest task of her life.\r\n\r\nCuriosity as a factor has never, perhaps, been given its proper weight by\r\nphilosophers. Besides being fatal to a certain domestic animal, as an\r\ninstigating force it has brought joy and sorrow into the lives of men and\r\nwomen, and made and marred careers. And curiosity now laid hold of\r\nCynthia Ware. Why in the world she should ever have been curious about\r\nJethro Bass is a mystery to many, for the two of them were as far apart\r\nas the poles. Cynthia, of all people, took to watching the tanner's son,\r\nand listening to the brief colloquies he had with other men at Jonah\r\nWinch's store, when she went there to buy things for the parsonage; and\r\nit seemed to her that Jock had not been altogether wrong, and that there\r\nwas in the man an indefinable but very compelling force. And when a woman\r\nbegins to admit that a man has force, her curiosity usually increases. On\r\none or two of these occasions Cynthia had been startled to find his eyes\r\nfixed upon her, and though the feeling she had was closely akin to fear,\r\nshe found something distinctly pleasurable in it.\r\n\r\nMay came, and the pools dried up, the orchards were pink and white, the\r\nbirches and the maples were all yellow-green on the mountain sides\r\nagainst the dark pines, and Cynthia was driving the minister's gig to\r\nBrampton. Ahead of her, in the canon made by the road between the great\r\nwoods, strode an uncouth but powerful figure--coonskin cap, homespun\r\nbreeches tucked into boots, and all. The gig slowed down, and Cynthia\r\nbegan to tremble with that same delightful fear. She knew it must be\r\nwicked, because she liked it so much. Unaccountable thing! She felt all\r\nakin to the nature about her, and her blood was coursing as the sap\r\nrushes through a tree. She would not speak to him; of that she was sure,\r\nand equally sure that he would not speak to her. The horse was walking\r\nnow, and suddenly Jethro Bass faced around, and her heart stood still.\r\n\r\n\"H-how be you, Cynthy?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, Jethro?\"\r\n\r\nA thrush in the woods began to sing a hymn, and they listened. After that\r\na silence, save for the notes of answering birds quickened by the song,\r\nthe minister's horse nibbling at the bushes. Cynthia herself could not\r\nhave explained why she lingered. Suddenly he shot a question at her.\r\n\r\n\"Where be you goin'?\"\r\n\r\n\"To Brampton, to get Miss Lucretia to change this book,\" and she held it\r\nup from her lap. It was a very large book.\r\n\r\n\"Wh-what's it about,\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Napoleon Bonaparte.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was be?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was a very strong man. He began life poor and unknown, and fought his\r\nway upward until he conquered the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"C-conquered the world, did you say? Conquered the world?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nJethro pondered.\r\n\r\n\"Guess there's somethin' wrong about that book--somethin' wrong. Conquer\r\nthe United States?\"\r\n\r\nCynthia smiled. She herself did not realize that we were not a part of\r\nthe world, then.\r\n\r\n\"He conquered Europe; where all the kings and queens are, and became a\r\nking himself--an emperor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to-know!\" said Jethro. \"You said he was a poor boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you read the book, Jethro?\" Cynthia answered. \"I am sure I can\r\nget Miss Lucretia to let you have it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't know as I'd understand it,\" he demurred.\r\n\r\n\"I'll try to explain what you don't understand,\" said Cynthia, and her\r\nheart gave a bound at the very idea.\r\n\r\n\"Will You?\" he said, looking at her eagerly. \"Will you? You mean it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" she answered, and blushed, not knowing why. \"I-I must be\r\ngoing,\" and she gathered up the reins.\r\n\r\n\"When will you give it to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll stop at the tannery when I come back from Brampton,\" she said, and\r\ndrove on. Once she gave a fleeting glance over her shoulder, and he was\r\nstill standing where she had left him.\r\n\r\nWhen she returned, in the yellow afternoon light that flowed over wood\r\nand pasture, he came out of the tannery door. Jake Wheeler or Speedy\r\nBates, the journeyman tailoress, from whom little escaped, could not have\r\nsaid it was by design--thought nothing, indeed, of that part of it.\r\n\r\n\"As I live!\" cried Speedy from the window to Aunt Lucy Prescott in the\r\nbed, \"if Cynthy ain't givin' him a book as big as the Bible!\"\r\n\r\nAunt Lucy hoped, first, that it was the Bible, and second, that Jethro\r\nwould read it. Aunt Lucy, and Established Church Coniston in general,\r\nbelieved in snatching brands from the burning, and who so deft as Cynthia\r\nat this kind of snatching! So Cynthia herself was a hypocrite for once,\r\nand did not know it. At that time Jethro's sins were mostly of omission.\r\nAs far as rum was concerned, he was a creature after Aunt Lucy's own\r\nheart, for he never touched it: true, gaunt Deacon Ira Perkins,\r\ntithing-man, had once chided him for breaking the Sabbath--shooting at a\r\nfox.\r\n\r\nTo return to the book. As long as he lived, Jethro looked back to the joy\r\nof the monumental task of mastering its contents. In his mind, Napoleon\r\nbecame a rough Yankee general; of the cities, villages, and fortress he\r\nformed as accurate a picture as a resident of Venice from Marco Polo's\r\naccount of Tartary. Jethro had learned to read, after a fashion, to\r\nwrite, add, multiply, and divide. He knew that George Washington and\r\ncertain barefooted companions had forced a proud Britain to her knees,\r\nand much of the warring in the book took color from Captain Timothy\r\nPrescott's stories of General Stark and his campaigns, heard at Jonah\r\nWinch's store. What Paris looked like, or Berlin, or the Hospice of St.\r\nBernard--though imaged by a winter Coniston--troubled Jethro not at all;\r\nthe thing that stuck in his mind was that Napoleon--for a considerable\r\ntime, at least--compelled men to do his bidding. Constitutions crumble\r\nbefore the Strong. Not that Jethro philosophized about constitutions.\r\nExisting conditions presented themselves, and it occurred to him that\r\nthere were crevices in the town system, and ways into power through the\r\ncrevices for men clever enough to find them.\r\n\r\nA week later, and in these same great woods on the way to Brampton,\r\nCynthia overtook him once more. It was characteristic of him that he\r\nplunged at once into the subject uppermost in his mind.\r\n\r\n\"Not a very big place, this Corsica--not a very big place.\"\r\n\r\n\"A little island in the Mediterranean,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"Hum. Country folks, the Bonapartes--country folks?\"\r\n\r\nCynthia laughed.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you might call them so,\" she said. \"They were poor, and lived\r\nout of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was a smart man. But he found things goin' his way. Didn't have to\r\nmove 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at first;\" she admitted; \"but he had to move mountains later. How\r\nfar have you read?\"\r\n\r\n\"One thing that helped him,\" said Jethro, in indirect answer to this\r\nquestion, \"he got a smart woman for his wife--a smart woman.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia looked down at the reins in her lap, and she felt again that\r\nwicked stirring within her,--incredible stirring of minister's daughter\r\nfor tanner's son. Coniston believes, and always will believe, that the\r\nsocial bars are strong enough. So Cynthia looked down at the reins.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Josephine!\" she said, \"I always wish he had not cast her off.\"\r\n\r\n\"C-cast her off?\" said Jethro. \"Cast her off! Why did he do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"After a while, when he got to be Emperor, he needed a wife who would be\r\nmore useful to him. Josephine had become a drag. He cared more about\r\ngetting on in the world than he did about his wife.\"\r\n\r\nJethro looked away contemplatively.\r\n\r\n\"Wa-wahn't the woman to blame any?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Read the book, and you'll see,\" retorted Cynthia, flicking her horse,\r\nwhich started at all gaits down the road. Jethro stood in his tracks,\r\nstaring, but this time he did not see her face above the hood of the gig.\r\nPresently he trudged on, head downward, pondering upon another problem\r\nthan Napoleon's. Cynthia, at length, arrived in Brampton Street, in a\r\nhumor that puzzled the good Miss Lucretia sorely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nThe sun had dropped behind the mountain, leaving Coniston in amethystine\r\nshadow, and the last bee had flown homeward from the apple blossoms in\r\nfront of Aunt Lucy Prescott's window, before Cynthia returned. Aunt Lucy\r\nwas Cynthia's grandmother, and eighty-nine years of age. Still she sat in\r\nher window beside the lilac bush, lost in memories of a stout, rosy lass\r\nwho had followed a stalwart husband up a broad river into the wilderness\r\nsome seventy years agone in Indian days--Weathersfield Massacre days.\r\nThat lass was Aunt Lucy herself, and in just such a May had Timothy's axe\r\nrung through the Coniston forest and reared the log cabin, where six of\r\nher children were born. Likewise in review passed the lonely months when\r\nTimothy was fighting behind his rugged General Stark for that privilege\r\nmore desirable to his kind than life--self government. Timothy Prescott\r\nwould pull the forelock to no man, would have such God-fearing persons as\r\nhe chose make his laws for him.\r\n\r\nHonest Captain Timothy and his Stark heroes, Aunt Lucy and her memories,\r\nhave long gone to rest. Little did they dream of the nation we have lived\r\nto see, straining at her constitution like a great ship at anchor in a\r\ngale, with funnels belching forth smoke, and a new race of men thronging\r\nher decks for the mastery. Coniston is there still behind its mountain,\r\nwith its rusty firelocks and its hillside graves.\r\n\r\nCynthia, driving back from Brampton in the gig, smiled at Aunt Lucy in\r\nthe window, but she did not so much as glance at the tannery house\r\nfarther on. The tannery house, be it known, was the cottage where Jethro\r\ndwelt, and which had belonged to Nathan, his father; and the tannery\r\nsheds were at some distance behind it, nearer Coniston Water. Cynthia did\r\nnot glance at the tannery house, for a wave of orthodox indignation had\r\nswept over her: at any rate, we may call it so. In other words, she was\r\nangry with herself: pitied and scorned herself, if the truth be told, for\r\nher actions--an inevitable mood.\r\n\r\nIn front of the minister's barn under the elms on the hill Cynthia pulled\r\nthe harness from the tired horse with an energy that betokened activity\r\nof mind. She was not one who shrank from self-knowledge, and the question\r\nput itself to her, \"Whither was this matter tending?\" The fire that is in\r\nstrong men has ever been a lure to women; and many, meaning to play with\r\nit, have been burnt thereby since the world began. But to turn the fire.\r\nto some use, to make the world better for it or stranger for it, that\r\nwere an achievement indeed! The horse munching his hay, Cynthia lingered\r\nas the light fainted above the ridge, with the thought that this might be\r\nwoman's province, and Miss Lucretia Penniman might go on leading her\r\nwomen regiments to no avail. Nevertheless she was angry with Jethro, not\r\nbecause of what he had said, but because of what he was.\r\n\r\nThe next day is Sunday, and there is mild excitement in Coniston. For\r\nJethro Bass, still with the coonskin cap, but in a brass-buttoned coat\r\nsecretly purchased in Brampton, appeared at meeting! It made no\r\ndifference that he entered quietly, and sat in the rear slip, orthodox\r\nConiston knew that he was behind them: good Mr. Ware knew it, and changed\r\na little his prayers and sermon: Cynthia knew it, grew hot and cold by\r\nturns under her poke bonnet. Was he not her brand, and would she not get\r\nthe credit of snatching him? How willingly, then, would she have given up\r\nthat credit to the many who coveted it--if it were a credit. Was Jethro\r\nat meeting for any religious purpose?\r\n\r\nJethro's importance to Coniston lay in his soul, and that soul was\r\nnumbered at present ninety and ninth. When the meeting was over, Aunt\r\nLucy Prescott hobbled out at an amazing pace to advise him to read\r\nchapter seven of Matthew, but he had vanished: via the horse sheds; if\r\nshe had known it, and along Coniston Water to the house by the tannery,\r\nwhere he drew breath in a state of mind not to be depicted. He had gazed\r\nat the back of Cynthia's poke bonnet for two hours, but he had an uneasy\r\nfeeling that he would have to pay a price.\r\n\r\nThe price was paid, in part, during the next six days. To do Jethro's\r\nimportance absolute justice, he did inspire fear among his\r\ncontemporaries, and young men and women did not say much to his face;\r\nwhat they did say gave them little satisfaction. Grim Deacon Ira stopped\r\nhim as he was going to buy hides, and would have prayed over him if\r\nJethro had waited; dear Aunt Lucy did pray, but in private. In six days\r\northodox Coniston came to the conclusion that this ninety and ninth soul\r\nwere better left to her who had snatched it, Cynthia Ware.\r\n\r\nAs for Cynthia, nothing was farther from her mind. Unchristian as was the\r\nthought, if this thing she had awakened could only have been put back to\r\nsleep again, she would have thought herself happy. But would she have\r\nbeen happy? When Moses Hatch congratulated her, with more humor than\r\nsincerity, he received the greatest scare of his life. Yet in those days\r\nshe welcomed Moses's society as she never had before; and Coniston,\r\nincluding Moses himself, began thinking of a wedding.\r\n\r\nAnother Saturday came, and no Cynthia went to Brampton. Jethro may or may\r\nnot have been on the road. Sunday, and there was Jethro on the back seat\r\nin the meetinghouse: Sunday noon, over his frugal dinner, the minister\r\nmildly remonstrates with Cynthia for neglecting one who has shown signs\r\nof grace, citing certain failures of others of his congregation: Cynthia\r\nturns scarlet, leaving the minister puzzled and a little uneasy: Monday,\r\nMiss Lucretia Penniman, alarmed, comes to Coniston to inquire after\r\nCynthia's health: Cynthia drives back with her as far as Four Corners,\r\ntalking literature and the advancement of woman; returns on foot,\r\nthinking of something else, when she discerns a figure seated on a log by\r\nthe roadside, bent as in meditation. There was no going back the thing to\r\ndo was to come on, as unconcernedly as possible, not noticing\r\nanything,--which Cynthia did, not without a little inward palpitating and\r\ncuriosity, for which she hated herself and looked the sterner. The figure\r\nunfolded itself, like a Jack from a box.\r\n\r\n\"You say the woman wahn't any to blame--wahn't any to blame?\"\r\n\r\nThe poke bonnet turned away. The shoulders under it began to shake, and\r\npresently the astonished Jethro heard what seemed to be faint peals of\r\nlaughter. Suddenly she turned around to him, all trace of laughter gone.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you read the book?\"\r\n\r\n\"So I am,\" said Jethro, \"so I am. Hain't come to this casting-off yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you didn't look ahead to find out?\" This with scorn.\r\n\r\n\"Never heard of readin' a book in that fashion. I'll come to it in\r\ntime--g-guess it won't run away.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia stared at him, perhaps with a new interest at this plodding\r\ndetermination. She was not quite sure that she ought to stand talking to\r\nhim a third time in these woods, especially if the subject of\r\nconversation were not, as Coniston thought, the salvation of his soul.\r\nBut she stayed. Here was a woman who could be dealt with by no known\r\nrules, who did not even deign to notice a week of marked coldness.\r\n\r\n\"Jethro,\" she said, with a terrifying sternness, \"I am going to ask you a\r\nquestion, and you must answer me truthfully.\"\r\n\r\n\"G-guess I won't find any trouble about that,\" said Jethro, apparently\r\nnot in the least terrified.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to tell me why you are going to meeting.\"\r\n\r\n\"To see you,\" said Jethro, promptly, \"to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know that that is wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"H-hadn't thought much about it,\" answered Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you should think about it. People don't go to meeting to--to look\r\nat other people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thought they did,\" said Jethro. \"W-why do they wear their best\r\nclothes--why do they wear their best clothes?\"\r\n\r\n\"To honor God,\" said Cynthia, with a shade lacking in the conviction, for\r\nshe added hurriedly: \"It isn't right for you to go to church to\r\nsee--anybody. You go there to hear the Scriptures expounded, and to have\r\nyour sins forgiven. Because I lent you that book, and you come to\r\nmeeting, people think I'm converting you.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you be,\" replied Jethro, and this time it was he who smiled, \"so you\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia turned away, her lips pressed together: How to deal with such a\r\nman! Wondrous notes broke on the stillness, the thrush was singing his\r\nhymn again, only now it seemed a paean. High in the azure a hawk wheeled,\r\nand floated.\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't you see I was very angry with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"S-saw you was goin' with Moses Hatch more than common.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia drew breath sharply. This was audacity--and yet she liked it.\r\n\r\n\"I am very fond of Moses,\" she said quickly.\r\n\r\n\"You always was charitable, Cynthy,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Haven't I been charitable to you?\" she retorted.\r\n\r\n\"G-guess it has be'n charity,\" said Jethro. He looked down at her\r\nsolemnly, thoughtfully, no trace of anger in his face, turned, and\r\nwithout another word strode off in the direction of Coniston Flat.\r\n\r\nHe left a tumultuous Cynthia, amazement and repentance struggling with\r\nanger, which forbade her calling him back: pride in her answering to\r\npride in him, and she rejoicing fiercely that he had pride. Had he but\r\nknown it, every step he took away from her that evening was a step in\r\nadvance, and she gloried in the fact that he did not once look back. As\r\nshe walked toward Coniston, the thought came to her that she was rid of\r\nthe thing she had stirred up, perhaps forever, and the thrush burst into\r\nhis song once more.\r\n\r\nThat night, after Cynthia's candle had gone out, when the minister sat on\r\nhis doorsteps looking at the glory of the moon on the mountain forest, he\r\nwas startled by the sight of a figure slowly climbing toward him up the\r\nslope. A second glance told him that it was Jethro's. Vaguely troubled,\r\nhe watched his approach; for good Priest Ware, while able to obey\r\none-half the scriptural injunction, had not the wisdom of the serpent,\r\nand women, as typified by Cynthia, were a continual puzzle to him. That\r\nvery evening, Moses Hatch had called, had been received with more favor\r\nthan usual, and suddenly packed off about his business. Seated in the\r\nmoonlight, the minister wondered vaguely whether Jethro Bass were\r\ntroubling the girl. And now Jethro stood before him, holding out a book.\r\nRising, Mr. Ware bade him good evening, mildly and cordially.\r\n\r\n\"C-come to leave this book for Cynthy,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\nMr. Ware took it, mechanically.\r\n\r\n\"Have you finished it?\" he asked kindly.\r\n\r\n\"All I want,\" replied Jethro, \"all I want.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned, and went down the slope. Twice the words rose to the\r\nminister's lips to call him back, and were suppressed. Yet what to say to\r\nhim if he came? Mr. Ware sat down again, sadly wondering why Jethro Bass\r\nshould be so difficult to talk to.\r\n\r\nThe parsonage was of only one story, with a steep, sloping roof. On the\r\nleft of the doorway was Cynthia's room, and the minister imagined he\r\nheard a faint, rustling noise at her window. Presently he arose, barred\r\nthe door; could be heard moving around in his room for a while, and\r\nafter that all was silence save for the mournful crying of a whippoorwill\r\nin the woods. Then a door opened softly, a white vision stole into the\r\nlittle entry lighted by the fan-window, above, seized the book and stole\r\nback. Had the minister been a prying man about his household, he would\r\nhave noticed next day that Cynthia's candle was burned down to the\r\nsocket. He saw nothing of the kind: he saw, in fact, that his daughter\r\nflitted about the house singing, and he went out into the sun to drop\r\npotatoes.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he reached the barn than this singing ceased. But how was\r\nMr. Ware to know that?\r\n\r\nTwice Cynthia, during the week that followed, got halfway down the slope\r\nof the parsonage hill, the book under her arm, on her way to the tannery;\r\ntwice went back, tears of humiliation and self-pity in her eyes at the\r\nthought that she should make advances to a man, and that man the tanner's\r\nson. Her household work done, a longing for further motion seized her,\r\nand she walked out under the maples of the village street. Let it be\r\nunderstood that Coniston was a village, by courtesy, and its shaded road\r\na street. Suddenly, there was the tannery, Jethro standing in front of\r\nit, contemplative. Did he see her? Would he come to her? Cynthia, seized\r\nby a panic of shame, flew into Aunt Lucy Prescott's, sat through half an\r\nhour of torture while Aunt Lucy talked of redemption of sinners, during\r\nten minutes of which Jethro stood, still contemplative. What tumult was\r\nin his breast, or whether there was any tumult, Cynthia knew not. He went\r\ninto the tannery again, and though she saw him twice later in the week,\r\nhe gave no sign of seeing her.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday Cynthia bought a new bonnet in Brampton; Sunday morning put\r\nit on, suddenly remembered that one went to church to honor God, and wore\r\nher old one; walked to meeting in a flutter of expectancy not to be\r\ndenied, and would have looked around had that not been a cardinal sin in\r\nConiston. No Jethro! General opinion (had she waited to hear it among the\r\nhorse sheds or on the green), that Jethro's soul had slid back into the\r\nmurky regions, from which it were folly for even Cynthia to try to drag\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTo prove that Jethro's soul had not slid back into the murky regions, and\r\nthat it was still indulging in flights, it is necessary to follow him\r\n(for a very short space) to Boston. Jethro himself went in Lyman Hull's\r\nsix-horse team with a load of his own merchandise--hides that he had\r\ntanned, and other country produce. And they did not go by the way of\r\nTruro Pass to the Capital, but took the state turnpike over the ranges,\r\nwhere you can see for miles and miles and miles on a clear summer day\r\nacross the trembling floors of the forest tops to lonely sentinel\r\nmountains fourscore miles away.\r\n\r\nNo one takes the state turnpike nowadays except crazy tourists who are\r\nwilling to risk their necks and their horses' legs for the sake of\r\nscenery. The tough little Morgans of that time, which kept their feet\r\nlike cats, have all but disappeared, but there were places on that road\r\nwhere Lyman Hull put the shoes under his wheels for four miles at a\r\nstretch. He was not a companion many people would have chosen with whom\r\nto enjoy the beauties of such a trip, and nearly everybody in Coniston\r\nwas afraid of him. Jethro Bass would sit silent on the seat for hours\r\nand--it is a fact to be noted that when he told Lyman to do a thing,\r\nLyman did it; not, perhaps, without cursing and grumbling. Lyman was a\r\nprofane and wicked man--drover, farmer, trader, anything. He had a cider\r\nmill on his farm on the south slopes of Coniston which Mr. Ware had\r\nmentioned in his sermons, and which was the resort of the ungodly. The\r\ncider was not so good as Squire Northcutt's, but cheaper. Jethro was not\r\nafraid of Lyman, and he had a mortgage on the six-horse team, and on the\r\nfarm and the cider mill.\r\n\r\nAfter six days, Jethro and Lyman drove over Charlestown bridge and into\r\nthe crooked streets of Boston, and at length arrived at a drover's hotel,\r\nor lodging-house that did not, we may be sure, front on Mount Vernon\r\nStreet or face the Mall. Lyman proceeded to get drunk, and Jethro to sell\r\nthe hides and other merchandise which Lyman had hauled for him.\r\n\r\nThere was a young man in Boston, when Jethro arrived in Lyman Hull's\r\nteam, named William Wetherell. By extraordinary circumstances he and\r\nanother connected with him are to take no small part in this story, which\r\nis a sufficient excuse for his introduction. His father had been a\r\nprosperous Portsmouth merchant in the West India trade, a man of many\r\nattainments, who had failed and died of a broken heart; and William, at\r\ntwo and twenty, was a clerk in the little jewellery shop of Mr. Judson in\r\nCornhill.\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell had literary aspirations, and sat from morning till\r\nnight behind the counter, reading and dreaming: dreaming that he was to\r\nbe an Irving or a Walter Scott, and yet the sum total of his works in\r\nafter years consisted of some letters to the Newcastle Guardian, and a\r\nbeginning of the Town History of Coniston!\r\n\r\nWilliam had a contempt for the awkward young countryman who suddenly\r\nloomed up before him that summer's morning across the counter. But a\r\nmoment before the clerk had been in a place where he would fain have\r\nlingered--a city where blue waters flow swiftly between white palaces\r\ntoward the sunrise.\r\n\r\n     \"And I have fitted up some chambers there\r\n     Looking toward the golden Eastern air,\r\n     And level with the living winds, which flow\r\n     Like waves above the living waves below.\"\r\n\r\nLittle did William Wetherell guess, when he glanced up at the intruder,\r\nthat he was looking upon one of the forces of his own life! The\r\ncountryman wore a blue swallow tail coat (fashioned by the hand of Speedy\r\nBates), a neck-cloth, a coonskin cap, and his trousers were tucked into\r\nrawhide boots. He did not seem a promising customer for expensive\r\njewellery, and the literary clerk did not rise, but merely closed his\r\nbook with his thumb in it.\r\n\r\n\"S-sell things here,\" asked the countryman, \"s-sell things here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Occasionally, when folks have money to buy them.\"\r\n\r\n\"My name's Jethro Bass,\" said the countryman, \"Jethro Bass from Coniston.\r\nEver hear of Coniston?\"\r\n\r\nYoung Mr. Wetherell never had, but many years afterward he remembered his\r\nname, heaven knows why. Jethro Bass! Perhaps it had a strange ring to it.\r\n\r\n\"F-folks told me to be careful,\" was Jethro's next remark. He did not\r\nlook at the clerk, but kept his eyes fixed on the things within the\r\ncounter.\r\n\r\n\"Somebody ought to have come with you,\" said the clerk, with a smile of\r\nsuperiority.\r\n\r\n\"D-don't know much about city ways.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the clerk, beginning to be amused, \"a man has to keep his\r\nwits about him.\"\r\n\r\nEven then Jethro spared him a look, but continued to study the contents\r\nof the case.\r\n\r\n\"What can I do for you, Mr. Bass? We have some really good things here.\r\nFor example, this Swiss watch, which I will sell you cheap, for one\r\nhundred and fifty dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"One hundred and fifty dollars--er--one hundred and fifty?\"\r\n\r\nWetherell nodded. Still the countryman did not look up.\r\n\r\n\"F-folks told me to be careful,\" he repeated without a smile. He was\r\nlooking at the lockets, and finally pointed a large finger at one of\r\nthem--the most expensive, by the way. \"W-what d'ye get for that?\" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty dollars,\" the clerk promptly replied. Thirty was nearer the\r\nprice, but what did it matter.\r\n\r\n\"H-how much for that?\" he said, pointing to another. The clerk told him.\r\nHe inquired about them all, deliberately repeating the sums, considering\r\nwith so well-feigned an air of a purchaser that Mr. Wetherell began to\r\ntake a real joy in the situation. For trade was slack in August, and\r\ndiversion scarce. Finally he commanded that the case be put on the top of\r\nthe counter, and Wetherell humored him. Whereupon he picked up the locket\r\nhe had first chosen. It looked very delicate in his huge, rough hand, and\r\nWetherell was surprised that the eyes of Mr. Bass had been caught by the\r\nmost expensive, for it was far from being the showiest.\r\n\r\n\"T-twenty dollars?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"We may as well call it that,\" laughed Wetherell.\r\n\r\n\"It's not too good for Cynthy,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing's too good for Cynthy,\" answered Mr. Wetherell, mockingly,\r\nlittle knowing how he might come to mean it.\r\n\r\nJethro Bass paid no attention to this speech. Pulling a great cowhide\r\nwallet from his pocket, still holding the locket in his hand, to the\r\namazement of the clerk he counted out twenty dollars and laid them down.\r\n\r\n\"G-guess I'll take that one, g-guess I'll take that one,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThen he looked at Mr. Wetherell for the first time.\r\n\r\n\"Hold!\" cried the clerk, more alarmed than he cared to show, \"that's not\r\nthe price. Did you think I could sell it for that price?\"\r\n\r\n\"W-wahn't that the price you fixed?\"\r\n\r\n\"You simpleton!\" retorted Wetherell, with a conviction now that he was\r\ncalling him the wrong name. \"Give me back the locket, and you shall have\r\nyour money, again.\"\r\n\r\n\"W-wahn't that the price you fixed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"G-guess I'll keep the locket--g-guess I'll keep the locket.\"\r\n\r\nWetherell looked at him aghast, and there was no doubt about his\r\ndetermination. With a sinking heart the clerk realized that he should\r\nhave to make good to Mr. Judson the seven odd dollars of difference, and\r\nthen he lost his head. Slipping round the counter to the door of the\r\nshop, he turned the key, thrust it in his pocket, and faced Mr. Bass\r\nagain--from behind the counter.\r\n\r\n\"You don't leave this shop,\" cried the clerk, \"until you give me back\r\nthat locket.\"\r\n\r\nJethro Bass turned. A bench ran along the farther wall, and there he\r\nplanted himself without a word, while the clerk stared at him,--with what\r\nfeelings of uneasiness I shall not attempt to describe,--for the customer\r\nwas plainly determined to wait until hunger should drive one of them\r\nforth. The minutes passed, and Wetherell began to hate him. Then some one\r\ntried the door, peered in through the glass, perceived Jethro, shook the\r\nknob, knocked violently, all to no purpose. Jethro seemed lost in a\r\nreverie.\r\n\r\n\"This has gone far enough,\" said the clerk, trying to keep his voice from\r\nshaking \"it is beyond a joke. Give me back the locket.\" And he tendered\r\nJethro the money again.\r\n\r\n\"W-wahn't that the price you fixed?\" asked Jethro, innocently.\r\n\r\nWetherell choked. The man outside shook the door again, and people on the\r\nsidewalk stopped, and presently against the window panes a sea of curious\r\nfaces gazed in upon them. Mr. Bass's thoughts apparently were fixed on\r\nEternity--he looked neither at the people nor at Wetherell. And then, the\r\ncrowd parting as for one in authority, as in a bad dream the clerk saw\r\nhis employer, Mr. Judson, courteously pushing away the customer at the\r\ndoor who would not be denied. Another moment, and Mr. Judson had gained\r\nadmittance with his private key, and stood on the threshold staring at\r\nclerk and customer. Jethro gave no sign that the situation had changed.\r\n\r\n\"William,\" said Mr. Judson, in a dangerously quiet voice, \"perhaps you\r\ncan explain this extraordinary state of affairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can, sir,\" William cried. \"This gentleman\" (the word stuck in his\r\nthroat), \"this gentleman came in here to examine lockets which I had no\r\nreason to believe he would buy. I admit my fault, sir. He asked the price\r\nof the most expensive, and I told him twenty dollars, merely for a jest,\r\nsir.\" William hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" said Mr. Judson.\r\n\r\n\"After pricing every locket in the case, he seized the first one, handed\r\nme twenty dollars, and now refuses to give it up, although he knows the\r\nprice is twenty-seven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I locked the door, sir. He sat down there, and hasn't moved since.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Judson looked again at Mr. Bass; this time with unmistakable\r\ninterest. The other customer began to laugh, and the crowd was pressing\r\nin, and Mr. Judson turned and shut the door in their faces. All this time\r\nMr. Bass had not moved, not so much as to lift his head or shift one of\r\nhis great cowhide boots.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir,\" demanded Mr. Judson, \"what have you to say?\"\r\n\r\n\"N-nothin'. G-guess I'll keep the locket. I've, paid for it--I've paid\r\nfor it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are aware, my friend,\" said Mr. Judson, \"that my clerk has given\r\nyou the wrong price?\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess that's his lookout.\" He still sat there, doggedly unconcerned.\r\n\r\nA bull would have seemed more at home in a china shop than Jethro Bass in\r\na jewellery store. But Mr. Judson himself was a man out of the ordinary,\r\nand instead of getting angry he began to be more interested.\r\n\r\n\"Took you for a greenhorn, did he?\" he remarked.\r\n\r\n\"F-folks told me to be careful--to be careful,\" said Mr. Bass.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Judson laughed. It was all the more disconcerting to William\r\nWetherell, because his employer laughed rarely. He laid his hand on\r\nJethro's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"He might have spared himself the trouble, my young friend,\" he said.\r\n\"You didn't expect to find a greenhorn behind a jewellery counter, did\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"S-surprised me some,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\nMr. Judson laughed again, all the while looking at him.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to let you keep the locket,\" he said, \"because it will teach\r\nmy greenhorn a lesson. William, do you hear that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" William said, and his face was very red.\r\n\r\nMr. Bass rose solemnly, apparently unmoved by his triumph in a somewhat\r\nremarkable transaction, and William long remembered how he towered over\r\nall of them. He held the locket out to Mr. Judson, who stared at it,\r\nastonished.\r\n\r\n\"What's this?\" said that gentleman; \"you don't want it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess I'll have it marked,\" said Jethro, \"ef it don't cost extry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Marked!\" gasped Mr. Judson, \"marked!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ef it don't cost extry,\" Jethro repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll--\" exclaimed Mr. Judson, and suddenly recalled the fact that\r\nhe was a church member. \"What inscription do you wish put into it?\" he\r\nasked, recovering himself with an effort.\r\n\r\nJethro thrust his hand into his pocket, and again the cowhide wallet came\r\nout. He tendered Mr. Judson a somewhat soiled piece of paper, and Mr.\r\nJudson read:--\r\n\r\n        \"Cynthy, from Jethro\"\r\n\r\n\"Cynthy,\" Mr. Judson repeated, in a tremulous voice, \"Cynthy, not\r\nCynthia.\"\r\n\r\n\"H-how is it written,\" said Jethro, leaning over it, \"h-how is it\r\nwritten?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cynthy,\" answered Mr. Judson, involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\"Then make it Cynthy--make it Cynthy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cynthy it shall be,\" said Mr. Judson, with conviction.\r\n\r\n\"When'll you have it done?\"\r\n\r\n\"To-night,\" replied Mr. Judson, with a twinkle in his eye, \"to-night, as\r\na special favor.\"\r\n\r\n\"What time--w-what time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seven o'clock, sir. May I send it to your hotel? The Tremont House, I\r\nsuppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"I-I'll call,\" said Jethro, so solemnly that Mr. Judson kept his laughter\r\nuntil he was gone.\r\n\r\nFrom the door they watched him silently as he strode across the street\r\nand turned the corner. Then Mr. Judson turned. \"That man will make his\r\nmark, William,\" he said; and added thoughtfully, \"but whether for good or\r\nevil, I know not.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nWhat Cynthia may have thought or felt during Jethro's absence in Boston,\r\nand for some months thereafter, she kept to herself. Honest Moses Hatch\r\npursued his courting untroubled, and never knew that he had a rival.\r\nMoses would as soon have questioned the seasons or the weather as\r\nCynthia's changes of moods,--which were indeed the weather for him, and\r\nwhen storms came he sat with his back to them, waiting for the sunshine.\r\nHe had long ceased proposing marriage, in the firm belief that Cynthia\r\nwould set the day in her own good time. Thereby he was saved much\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nThe summer flew on apace, for Coniston. Fragrant hay was cut on hillsides\r\nwon from rock and forest, and Coniston Water sang a gentler melody--save\r\nwhen the clouds floated among the spruces on the mountain and the rain\r\nbeat on the shingles. During the still days before the turn of the\r\nyear,--days of bending fruit boughs, crab-apples glistening red in the\r\nsoft sunlight,--rumor came from Brampton to wrinkle the forehead of Moses\r\nHatch as he worked among his father's orchards.\r\n\r\nThe rumor was of a Mr. Isaac Dudley Worthington, a name destined to make\r\nmuch rumor before it was to be carved on the marble. Isaac D.\r\nWorthington, indeed, might by a stretch of the imagination be called the\r\npioneer of all the genus to be known in the future as City Folks, who\r\nwere, two generations later, to invade the country like a devouring army\r\nof locusts.\r\n\r\nAt that time a stranger in Brampton was enough to set the town agog. But\r\na young man of three and twenty, with an independent income of four\r\nhundred dollars a year!--or any income at all not derived from his own\r\nlabor--was unheard of. It is said that when the stage from over Truro Gap\r\narrived in Brampton Street a hundred eyes gazed at him unseen, from\r\nvarious ambushes, and followed him up the walk to Silas Wheelock's, where\r\nhe was to board. In half an hour Brampton knew the essentials of Isaac\r\nWorthington's story, and Sam Price was on his way with it to Coniston for\r\ndistribution at Jonah Winch's store.\r\n\r\nYoung Mr. Worthington was from Boston--no less; slim, pale, medium\r\nheight, but with an alert look, and a high-bridged nose. But his clothes!\r\nSam Price's vocabulary was insufficient here, they were cut in such a\r\nway, and Mr. Worthington was downright distinguished-looking under his\r\ngray beaver. Why had he come to Brampton? demanded Deacon Ira Perkins.\r\nSam had saved this for the last. Young Mr. Worthington was threatened\r\nwith consumption, and had been sent to live with his distant relative,\r\nSilas Wheelock.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a gentleman of leisure--although threatened with\r\nconsumption--became an all-absorbing topic in two villages and three\r\nhamlets, and more than one swain, hitherto successful, felt the wind blow\r\ncolder. But in a fortnight it was known that a petticoat did not make\r\nIsaac Worthington even turn his head. Curiosity centred on Silas\r\nWheelock's barn, where Mr. Worthington had fitted up a shop, and,\r\npresently various strange models of contrivances began to take shape\r\nthere. What these were, Silas himself knew not; and the gentleman of\r\nleisure was, alas! close-mouthed. When he was not sawing and hammering\r\nand planing, he took long walks up and down Coniston Water, and was\r\nsurprised deep in thought at several places.\r\n\r\nNathan Bass's story-and-a-half house, devoid of paint, faced the road,\r\nand behind it was the shed, or barn, that served as the tannery, and\r\nbetween the tannery and Coniston Water were the vats. The rain flew in\r\nsilvery spray, and the drops shone like jewels on the coat of a young man\r\nwho stood looking in at the tannery door. Young Jake Wheeler, son of the\r\nvillage spendthrift, was driving a lean white horse round in a ring: to\r\nthe horse was attached a beam, and on the beam a huge round stone rolled\r\non a circular oak platform. Jethro Bass, who was engaged in pushing\r\nhemlock bark under the stone to be crushed, straightened. Of the three,\r\nthe horse had seen the visitor first, and stopped in his tracks.\r\n\r\n\"Jethro!\" whispered Jake, tingling with an excitement that was but\r\nnatural. Jethro had begun to sweep the finer pieces of bark toward the\r\ncentre. \"It's the city man, walked up here from Brampton.\"\r\n\r\nIt was indeed Mr. Worthington, slightly more sunburned and less\r\ncitified-looking than on his arrival, and he wore a woollen cap of\r\nBrampton make. Even then, despite his wavy hair and delicate appearance,\r\nIsaac Worthington had the hawk-like look which became famous in later\r\nyears, and at length he approached Jethro and fixed his eye upon him.\r\n\r\n\"Kind of slow work, isn't it?\" remarked Mr. Worthington.\r\n\r\nThe white horse was the only one to break the silence that followed, by\r\nsneezing with all his might.\r\n\r\n\"How is the tannery business in these parts?\" essayed Mr. Worthington\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"Thinkin' of it?\" said Jethro. \"T-thinkin' of it, be you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Mr. Worthington, hastily. \"If I were,\" he added, \"I'd put\r\nin new machinery. That horse and stone is primitive.\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind of machinery would you put in?\" asked Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" answered Worthington, \"that will interest you. All New Englanders\r\nare naturally progressive, I take it.\"\r\n\r\n\"W-what was it you took?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was merely remarking on the enterprise of New Englanders,\" said\r\nWorthington, flushing. \"On my journey up here, beside the Merrimac, I had\r\nthe opportunity to inspect the new steam-boiler, the falling-mill, the\r\nsplitting machine, and other remarkable improvements. In fact, these\r\nsuggested one or two little things to me, which might be of interest to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Jethro, \"they might, and then again they mightn't. Guess it\r\ndepends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Depends!\" exclaimed the man of leisure, \"depends on what?\"\r\n\r\n\"H-how much you know about it.\"\r\n\r\nYoung Mr. Worthington, instead of being justly indignant, laughed and\r\nsettled himself comfortably on a pile of bark. He thought Jethro a\r\ncharacter, and he was not mistaken. On the other hand, Mr. Worthington\r\ndisplayed a knowledge of the falling-mill and splitting-machine and the\r\nprocess of tanneries in general that was surprising. Jethro, had Mr.\r\nWorthington but known it, was more interested in animate machines: more\r\ninterested in Mr. Worthington than the falling-mill or, indeed, the\r\ntannery business.\r\n\r\nAt length the visitor fell silent, his sense of superiority suddenly\r\ngone. Others had had this same feeling with Jethro, even the minister;\r\nbut the man of leisure (who was nothing of the sort) merely felt a kind\r\nof bewilderment.\r\n\r\n\"Callatin' to live in Brampton--be you?\" asked Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"I am living there now.\"\r\n\r\n\"C-callatin' to set up a mill some day?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington fairly leaped off the bark pile.\r\n\r\n\"What makes you say that?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"G-guesswork,\" said Jethro, starting to shovel again, \"g-guesswork.\"\r\n\r\nTo take a walk in the wild, to come upon a bumpkin in cowhide boots\r\ncrushing bark, to have him read within twenty minutes a cherished and\r\nwell-hidden ambition which Brampton had not discovered in a month (and\r\ndid not discover for many years) was sufficiently startling. Well might\r\nMr. Worthington tremble for his other ambitions, and they were many.\r\n\r\nJethro stepped out, passing Mr. Worthington as though he had already\r\nforgotten that gentleman's existence, and seized an armful of bark that\r\nlay under cover of a lean-to. Just then, heralded by a brightening of the\r\nwestern sky, a girl appeared down the road, her head bent a little as in\r\nthought, and if she saw the group by the tannery house she gave no sign.\r\nTwo of them stared at her--Jake Wheeler and Mr. Worthington. Suddenly\r\nJake, implike, turned and stared at Worthington.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthy Ware, the minister's daughter,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Haven't I seen her in Brampton?\" inquired Mr. Worthington, little\r\nthinking of the consequences of the question.\r\n\r\n\"Guess you have,\" answered Jake. \"Cynthy goes to the Social Library, to\r\ngit books. She knows more'n the minister himself, a sight more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where does the minister live?\" asked Mr. Worthington.\r\n\r\nJake pulled him by the sleeve toward the road, and pointed to the low\r\ngable of the little parsonage under the elms on the hill beyond the\r\nmeeting-house. The visitor gave a short glance at it, swung around and\r\ngave a longer glance at the figure disappearing in the other direction.\r\nHe did not suspect that Jake was what is now called a news agency. Then\r\nMr. Worthington turned to Jethro, who was stooping over the bark.\r\n\r\n\"If you come to Brampton, call and see me,\" he said. \"You'll find me at\r\nSilas Wheelock's.\"\r\n\r\nHe got no answer, but apparently expected none, and he started off down\r\nthe Brampton road in the direction Cynthia had taken.\r\n\r\n\"That makes another,\" said Jake, significantly, \"and Speedy Bates says he\r\nnever looks at wimmen. Godfrey, I wish I could see Moses now.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington had not been quite ingenuous with Jake. To tell the\r\ntruth, he had made the acquaintance of the Social Library and Miss\r\nLucretia, and that lady had sung the praises of her favorite. Once out of\r\nsight of Jethro, Mr. Worthington quickened his steps, passed the store,\r\nwhere he was remarked by two of Jonah's customers, and his blood leaped\r\nwhen he saw the girl in front of him, walking faster now. Yes, it is a\r\nfact that Isaac Worthington's blood once leaped. He kept on, but when\r\nnear her had a spasm of fright to make his teeth fairly chatter, and than\r\nanother spasm followed, for Cynthia had turned around.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do Mr. Worthington?\" she said, dropping him a little\r\ncourtesy. Mr. Worthington stopped in his tracks, and it was some time\r\nbefore he remembered to take off his woollen cap and sweep the mud with\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"You know my name!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"It is known from Tarleton Four Corners to Harwich,\" said Cynthia, \"all\r\nthat distance. To tell the truth,\" she added, \"those are the boundaries\r\nof my world.\" And Mr. Worthington being still silent, \"How do you like\r\nbeing a big frog in a little pond?\"\r\n\r\n\"If it were your pond, Miss Cynthia,\" he responded gallantly, \"I should\r\nbe content to be a little frog.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you?\" she said; \"I don't believe you.\"\r\n\r\nThis was not subtle flattery, but the truth--Mr. Worthington would never\r\nbe content to be a little anything. So he had been judged twice in an\r\nafternoon, once by Jethro and again by Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you believe me?\" he asked ecstatically.\r\n\r\n\"A woman's instinct, Mr. Worthington, has very little reason in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hear, Miss Cynthia,\" he said gallantly, \"that your instinct is\r\nfortified by learning, since Miss Penniman tells me that you are quite\r\ncapable of taking a school in Boston.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I should be doubly sure of your character,\" she retorted with a\r\ntwinkle.\r\n\r\n\"Will you tell my fortune?\" he said gayly.\r\n\r\n\"Not on such a slight acquaintance,\" she replied. \"Good-by, Mr.\r\nWorthington.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall see you in Brampton,\" he cried, \"I--I have seen you in\r\nBrampton.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not answer this confession, but left him, and presently\r\ndisappeared beyond the triangle of the green, while Mr. Worthington\r\npursued his way to Brampton by the road,--his thoughts that evening not\r\non waterfalls or machinery. As for Cynthia's conduct, I do not defend or\r\nexplain it, for I have found out that the best and wisest of women can at\r\ntimes be coquettish.\r\n\r\nIt was that meeting which shook the serenity of poor Moses, and he\r\nlearned of it when he went to Jonah Winch's store an hour later. An hour\r\nlater, indeed, Coniston was discussing the man of leisure in a new light.\r\nIt was possible that Cynthia might take him, and Deacon Ira Perkins made\r\na note the next time he went to Brampton to question Silas Wheelock on\r\nMr. Worthington's origin, habits, and orthodoxy.\r\n\r\nCynthia troubled herself very little about any of these. Scarcely any\r\npurpose in the world is single, but she had had a purpose in talking to\r\nMr. Worthington, besides the pleasure it gave her. And the next Saturday,\r\nwhen she rode off to Brampton, some one looked through the cracks in the\r\ntannery shed and saw that she wore her new bonnet.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely a pleasanter place in the world than Brampton Street on\r\na summer's day. Down the length of it runs a wide green, shaded by\r\nspreading trees, and on either side, tree-shaded, too, and each in its\r\nown little plot, gabled houses of that simple, graceful architecture of\r\nour forefathers. Some of these had fluted pilasters and cornices, the\r\nenvy of many a modern architect, and fan-shaped windows in dormer and\r\ndoorway. And there was the church, then new, that still stands to the\r\nglory of its builders; with terraced steeple and pillared porch and the\r\nwidest of checker-paned sashes to let in the light on high-backed pews\r\nand gallery.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Social Library, halfway up the street, occupied part of\r\nMiss Lucretia's little house; or, it might better be said, Miss Lucretia\r\nboarded with the Social Library. There Cynthia hitched her horse, gave\r\ngreeting to Mr. Ezra Graves and others who paused, and, before she was\r\nfairly in the door, was clasped in Miss Lucretia's arms. There were new\r\nbooks to be discussed, arrived by the stage the day before; but scarce\r\nhalf an hour had passed before Cynthia started guiltily at a timid knock,\r\nand Miss Lucretia rose briskly.\r\n\r\n\"It must be Ezra Graves come for the Gibbon,\" she said. \"He's early.\" And\r\nshe went to the door. Cynthia thought it was not Ezra. Then came Miss\r\nLucretia's voice from the entry:--\r\n\r\n\"Why, Mr. Worthington! Have you read the Last of the Mohicans already?\"\r\n\r\nThere he stood, indeed, the man of leisure, and to-day he wore his beaver\r\nhat. No, he had not yet read the 'Last of the Mohicans.' There were\r\nthings in it that Mr. Worthington would like to discuss with Miss\r\nPenniman. Was it not a social library? At this juncture there came a\r\ngiggle from within that made him turn scarlet, and he scarcely heard Miss\r\nLucretia offering to discuss the whole range of letters. Enter Mr.\r\nWorthington, bows profoundly to Miss Lucretia's guest, his beaver in his\r\nhand, and the discussion begins, Cynthia taking no part in it. Strangely\r\nenough, Mr. Worthington's remarks on American Indians are not only\r\nintelligent, but interesting. The clock strikes four, Miss Lucretia\r\nstarts up, suddenly remembering that she has promised to read to an\r\ninvalid, and with many regrets from Mr. Worthington, she departs. Then he\r\nsits down again, twirling his beaver, while Cynthia looks at him in quiet\r\namusement.\r\n\r\n\"I shall walk to Coniston again, next week,\" he announced.\r\n\r\n\"What an energetic man!\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"I want to have my fortune told.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hear that you walk a great deal,\" she remarked, \"up and down Coniston\r\nWater. I shall begin to think you romantic, Mr. Worthington--perhaps a\r\npoet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't walk up and down Coniston Water for that reason,\" he answered\r\nearnestly.\r\n\r\n\"Might I be so bold as to ask the reason?\" she ventured.\r\n\r\nGreat men have their weaknesses. And many, close-mouthed with their own\r\nsex, will tell their cherished hopes to a woman, if their interests are\r\nengaged. With a bas-relief of Isaac Worthington in the town library\r\nto-day (his own library), and a full-length portrait of him in the\r\ncapitol of the state, who shall deny this title to greatness?\r\n\r\nHe leaned a little toward her, his face illumined by his subject, which\r\nwas himself.\r\n\r\n\"I will confide in you,\" he said, \"that some day I shall build here in\r\nBrampton a woollen mill which will be the best of its kind. If I gain\r\nmoney, it will not be to hoard it or to waste it. I shall try to make the\r\ntown better for it, and the state, and I shall try to elevate my\r\nneighbors.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia could not deny that these were laudable ambitions.\r\n\r\n\"Something tells me,\" he continued, \"that I shall succeed. And that is\r\nwhy I walk on Coniston Water--to choose the best site for a dam.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am honored by your secret, but I feel that the responsibility you\r\nrepose in me is too great,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I can think of none in whom I would rather confide,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"And am I the only one in all Brampton, Harwich, and Coniston who knows\r\nthis?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington laughed.\r\n\r\n\"The only one of importance,\" he answered. \"This week, when I went to\r\nConiston, I had a strange experience. I left the brook at a tannery, and\r\na most singular fellow was in the shed shovelling bark. I tried to get\r\nhim to talk, and told him about some new tanning machinery I had seen.\r\nSuddenly he turned on me and asked me if I was 'callatin' to set up a\r\nmill.' He gave me a queer feeling. Do you have many such odd characters\r\nin Coniston, Miss Cynthia? You're not going?\"\r\n\r\nCynthia had risen, and all of the laugher was gone from her eyes. What\r\nhad happened to make her grow suddenly grave, Isaac Worthington never\r\nknew.\r\n\r\n\"I have to get my father's supper,\" she said.\r\n\r\nHe, too, rose, puzzled and disconcerted at this change in her.\r\n\r\n\"And may I not come to Coniston?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"My father and I should be glad to see you, Mr. Worthington,\" she\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nHe untied her horse and essayed one more topic.\r\n\r\n\"You are taking a very big book,\" he said. \"May I look at the title?\"\r\n\r\nShe showed it to him in silence. It was the \"Life of Napoleon Bonaparte.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nIsaac Worthington came to Coniston not once, but many times, before the\r\nsnow fell; and afterward, too, in Silas Wheelock's yellow sleigh through\r\nthe great drifts under the pines, the chestnut Morgan trotting to one\r\nside in the tracks. On one of these excursions he fell in with that\r\nsingular character of a bumpkin who had interested him on his first\r\nvisit, in coonskin cap and overcoat and mittens. Jethro Bass was plodding\r\nin the same direction, and Isaac Worthington, out of the goodness of his\r\nheart, invited him into the sleigh. He was scarcely prepared for the\r\nbumpkin's curt refusal, but put it down to native boorishness, and\r\nthought no more about it then.\r\n\r\nWhat troubled Mr. Worthington infinitely more was the progress of his\r\nsuit; for it had become a snit, though progress is a wrong word to use in\r\nconnection with it. So far had he got,--not a great distance,--and then\r\ncame to what he at length discovered was a wall, and apparently\r\nimpenetrable. He was not even allowed to look over it. Cynthia was kind,\r\nengaging; even mirthful, at times, save when he approached it; and he\r\nbecame convinced that a certain sorrow lay in the forbidden ground. The\r\nnearest he had come to it was when he mentioned again, by accident, that\r\nlife of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThat Cynthia would accept him, nobody doubted for an instant. It would be\r\nmadness not to. He was orthodox, so Deacon Ira had discovered, of good\r\nhabits, and there was the princely four hundred a year--almost a\r\nminister's salary! Little people guessed that there was no\r\nlove-making--only endless discussions of books beside the great centre\r\nchimney, and discussions of Isaac Worthington's career.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact--for future consideration--that Isaac Worthington proposed\r\nto Cynthia Ware, although neither Speedy Bates nor Deacon Ira Perkins\r\nheard him do so. It had been very carefully prepared, that speech, and\r\nwas a model of proposals for the rising young men of all time. Mr.\r\nWorthington preferred to offer himself for what he was going to be--not\r\nfor what he was. He tendered to Cynthia a note for a large amount,\r\npayable in some twenty years, with interest. The astonishing thing to\r\nrecord is that in twenty years he could have more than paid the note,\r\nalthough he could not have foreseen at that time the Worthington Free\r\nLibrary and the Truro Railroad, and the stained-glass window in the\r\nchurch and the great marble monument on the hill--to another woman. All\r\nof these things, and more, Cynthia might have had if she had only\r\naccepted that promise to pay! But she did not accept it. He was a trifle\r\nmore robust than when he came to Brampton in the summer, but perhaps she\r\ndoubted his promise to pay.\r\n\r\nIt may have been guessed, although the language we have used has been\r\npurposely delicate, that Cynthia was already in love with--somebody else.\r\nShame of shames and horror of horrors--with Jethro Bass! With Strength,\r\nin the crudest form in which it is created, perhaps, but yet with\r\nStrength. The strength might gradually and eventually be refined. Such\r\nwas her hope, when she had any. It is hard, looking back upon that\r\nvirginal and cultured Cynthia, to be convinced that she could have loved\r\npassionately, and such a man! But love she did, and passionately, too,\r\nand hated herself for it, and prayed and struggled to cast out what she\r\nbelieved, at times, to be a devil.\r\n\r\nThe ancient allegory of Cupid and the arrows has never been improved\r\nupon: of Cupid, who should never in the world have been trusted with a\r\nweapon, who defies all game laws, who shoots people in the bushes and\r\ninnocent bystanders generally, the weak and the helpless and the strong\r\nand self-confident! There is no more reason in it than that. He shot\r\nCynthia Ware, and what she suffered in secret Coniston never guessed.\r\nWhat parallels in history shall I quote to bring home the enormity of\r\nsuch a mesalliance? Orthodox Coniston would have gone into sackcloth and\r\nashes,--was soon to go into these, anyway.\r\n\r\nI am not trying to keep the lovers apart for any mere purposes of\r\nfiction,--this is a true chronicle, and they stayed apart most of that\r\nwinter. Jethro went about his daily tasks, which were now become\r\nmanifold, and he wore the locket on its little chain himself. He did not\r\nthink that Cynthia loved him--yet, but he had the effrontery to believe\r\nthat she might, some day; and he was content to wait. He saw that she\r\navoided him, and he was too proud to go to the parsonage and so incur\r\nridicule and contempt.\r\n\r\nJethro was content to wait. That is a clew to his character throughout\r\nhis life. He would wait for his love, he would wait for his hate: he had\r\nwaited ten years before putting into practice the first step of a little\r\nscheme which he had been gradually developing during that time, for which\r\nhe had been amassing money, and the life of Napoleon Bonaparte, by the\r\nway, had given him some valuable ideas. Jethro, as well as Isaac D.\r\nWorthington, had ambitions, although no one in Coniston had hitherto\r\nguessed them except Jock Hallowell--and Cynthia Ware, after her curiosity\r\nhad been aroused.\r\n\r\nEven as Isaac D. Worthington did not dream of the Truro Railroad and of\r\nan era in the haze of futurity, it did not occur to Jethro Bass that his\r\nambitions tended to the making of another era that was at hand. Makers of\r\neras are too busy thinking about themselves and like immediate matters to\r\nworry about history. Jethro never heard the expression about \"cracks in\r\nthe Constitution,\" and would not have known what it meant,--he merely had\r\nthe desire to get on top. But with Established Church Coniston tight in\r\nthe saddle (in the person of Moses Hatch, Senior), how was he to do it?\r\n\r\nAs the winter wore on, and March town meeting approached, strange rumors\r\nof a Democratic ticket began to drift into Jonah Winch's store,--a\r\nDemocratic ticket headed by Fletcher Bartlett, of all men, as chairman of\r\nthe board. Moses laughed when he first heard of it, for Fletcher was an\r\neasy-going farmer of the Methodist persuasion who was always in debt, and\r\nthe other members of the ticket, so far as Moses could learn of it--were\r\nremarkable neither for orthodoxy or solidity. The rumors persisted, and\r\nstill Moses laughed, for the senior selectman was a big man with flesh on\r\nhim, who could laugh with dignity.\r\n\r\n\"Moses,\" said Deacon Lysander Richardson as they stood on the platform of\r\nthe store one sunny Saturday in February, \"somebody's put Fletcher up to\r\nthis. He hain't got sense enough to act that independent all by himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You be always croakin', Lysander,\" answered Moses.\r\n\r\nCynthia Ware, who had come to the store for buttons for Speedy Bates, who\r\nwas making a new coat for the minister, heard these remarks, and stood\r\nthoughtfully staring at the blue coat-tails of the elders. A brass button\r\nwas gone from Deacon Lysander's, and she wanted to sew it on. Suddenly\r\nshe looked up, and saw Jock Hallowell standing beside her. Jock\r\nwinked--and Cynthia blushed and hurried homeward without a word. She\r\nremembered, vividly enough, what Jack had told her the spring before, and\r\nseveral times during the week that followed she thought of waylaying him\r\nand asking what he knew. But she could not summon the courage. As a\r\nmatter of fact, Jock knew nothing, but he had a theory. He was a strange\r\nman, Jock, who whistled all day on roof and steeple and meddled with\r\nnobody's business, as a rule. What had impelled him to talk to Cynthia in\r\nthe way he had must remain a mystery.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the disquieting rumors continued to come in. Jabez Miller, on\r\nthe north slope, had told Samuel Todd, who told Ephraim Williams, that he\r\nwas going to vote for Fletcher. Moses Hatch hitched up his team and went\r\nout to see Jabez, spent an hour in general conversation, and then plumped\r\nthe question, taking, as he said, that means of finding out. Jabez hemmed\r\nand hawed, said his farm was mortgaged; spoke at some length about the\r\nAmerican citizen, however humble, having a right to vote as he chose. A\r\nmost unusual line for Jabez, and the whole matter very mysterious and not\r\na little ominous. Moses drove homeward that sparkling day, shutting his\r\neyes to the glare of the ice crystals on the pines, and thinking\r\nprofoundly. He made other excursions, enough to satisfy himself that this\r\ndisease, so new and unheard of (the right of the unfit to hold office),\r\nactually existed. Where the germ began that caused it, Moses knew no\r\nbetter than the deacon, since those who were suspected of leanings toward\r\nFletcher Bartlett were strangely secretive. The practical result of\r\nMoses' profound thought was a meeting, in his own house, without respect\r\nto party, Democrats and Whigs alike, opened by a prayer from the minister\r\nhimself. The meeting, after a futile session, broke up dismally. Sedition\r\nand conspiracy existed; a chief offender and master mind there was,\r\nsomewhere. But who was he?\r\n\r\nGood Mr. Ware went home, troubled in spirit, shaking his head. He had a\r\ncold, and was not so strong as he used to be, and should not have gone to\r\nthe meeting at all. At supper, Cynthia listened with her eyes on her\r\nplate while he told her of the affair.\r\n\r\n\"Somebody's behind this, Cynthia,\" he said. \"It's the most astonishing\r\nthing in my experience that we cannot discover who has incited them. All\r\nthe unattached people in the town seem to have been organized.\" Mr. Ware\r\nwas wont to speak with moderation even at his own table. He said\r\nunattached--not ungodly.\r\n\r\nCynthia kept her eyes on her plate, but she felt as though her body were\r\nafire. Little did the minister imagine, as he went off to write his\r\nsermon, that his daughter might have given him the clew to the mystery.\r\nYes, Cynthia guessed; and she could not read that evening because of the\r\ntumult of her thoughts. What was her duty in the matter? To tell her\r\nfather her suspicions? They were only suspicions, after all, and she\r\ncould make no accusations. And Jethro! Although she condemned him, there\r\nwas something in the situation that appealed to a most reprehensible\r\nsense of humor. Cynthia caught herself smiling once or twice, and knew\r\nthat it was wicked. She excused Jethro, and told herself that, with his\r\nlack of training, he could know no better. Then an idea came to her, and\r\nthe very boldness of it made her grow hot again. She would appeal to him\r\ntell him that that power he had over other men could be put to better and\r\nfiner uses. She would appeal to him, and he would abandon the matter.\r\nThat the man loved her with the whole of his rude strength she was sure,\r\nand that knowledge had been the only salve to her shame.\r\n\r\nSo far we have only suspicions ourselves; and, strange to relate, if we\r\ngo around Coniston with Jethro behind his little red Morgan, we shall\r\ncome back with nothing but--suspicions. They will amount to convictions,\r\nyet we cannot prove them. The reader very naturally demands some specific\r\ninformation--how did Jethro do it? I confess that I can only indicate in\r\na very general way: I can prove nothing. Nobody ever could prove anything\r\nagainst Jethro Bass. Bring the following evidence before any grand jury\r\nin the country, and see if they don't throw it out of court.\r\n\r\nJethro in the course of his weekly round of strictly business visits\r\nthroughout the town, drives into Samuel Todd's farmyard, and hitches on\r\nthe sunny side of the red barns. The town of Coniston, it must be\r\nexplained for the benefit of those who do not understand the word \"town\"\r\nin the New England senses was a tract of country about ten miles by ten,\r\nthe most thickly settled portion of which was the village of Coniston,\r\nconsisting of twelve houses. Jethro drives into the barnyard, and Samuel\r\nTodd comes out. He is a little man, and has a habit of rubbing the sharp\r\nridge of his nose.\r\n\r\n\"How be you, Jethro?\" says Samuel. \"Killed the brindle Thursday. Finest\r\nhide you ever seed.\"\r\n\r\n\"G-goin' to town meetin' Tuesday--g-goin' to town meetin'\r\nTuesday--Sam'l?\" says Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"I was callatin' to, Jethro.\"\r\n\r\n\"Democrat--hain't ye--Democrat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Callate to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much store do ye set by that hide?\"\r\n\r\nSamuel rubs his nose. Then he names a price that the hide might fetch,\r\nunder favorable circumstances, in Boston--Jethro does not wince.\r\n\r\n\"Who d'ye callate to vote for, Sam'l?\"\r\n\r\nSamuel rubs his nose.\r\n\r\n\"Heerd they was a-goin' to put up Fletcher and Amos Cuthbert, an' Sam\r\nPrice for Moderator.\" (What a convenient word is they when used\r\npolitically!) \"Hain't made up my mind, clear,\" says Samuel.\r\n\r\n\"C-comin' by the tannery after town meetin'?\" inquired Jethro, casually.\r\n\r\n\"Don't know but what I kin.\"\r\n\r\n\"F-fetch the hide--f-fetch the hide.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Jethro drives off, with Samuel looking after him, rubbing his nose.\r\n\"No bill,\" says the jury--if you can get Samuel into court. But you\r\ncan't. Even Moses Hatch can get nothing out of Samuel, who then talks\r\nJacksonian principles and the nights of an American citizen.\r\n\r\nLet us pursue this matter a little farther, and form a committee of\r\ninvestigation. Where did Mr. Todd learn anything about Jacksonian\r\nprinciples? From Mr. Samuel Price, whom they have spoken of for\r\nModerator. And where did Mr. Price learn of these principles? Any one in\r\nConiston will tell you that Mr. Price makes a specialty of orators and\r\noratory; and will hold forth at the drop of a hat in Jonah Winch's store\r\nor anywhere else. Who is Mr. Price? He is a tall, sallow young man of\r\neight and twenty, with a wedge-shaped face, a bachelor and a Methodist,\r\nwho farms in a small way on the southern slope, and saves his money. He\r\nhas become almost insupportable since they have named him for Moderator.\r\n\r\nGet Mr. Sam Price into court. Here is a man who assuredly knows who they\r\nare: if we are, not much mistaken, he is their mouthpiece. Get, an eel\r\ninto court. There is only one man in town who can hold an eel, and he\r\nisn't on the jury. Mr. Price will talk plentifully, in his nasal way; but\r\nhe won't tell you anything.\r\n\r\nMr. Price has been nominated to fill Deacon Lysander Richardson's shoes\r\nin the following manner: One day in the late autumn a man in a coonskin\r\ncap stops beside Mr. Price's woodpile, where Mr. Price has been chopping\r\nwood, pausing occasionally to stare off through the purple haze at the\r\nsouth shoulder of Coniston Mountain.\r\n\r\n\"How be you, Jethro?\" says Mr. Price, nasally.\r\n\r\n\"D-Democrats are talkin' some of namin' you Moderator next meetin',\" says\r\nthe man in the coonskin cap.\r\n\r\n\"Want to know!\" ejaculates Mr. Price, dropping the axe and straightening\r\nup in amazement. For Mr. Price's ambition soared no higher, and he had\r\nmade no secret of it. \"Wal! Whar'd you hear that, Jethro?\"\r\n\r\n\"H-heerd it round--some. D-Democrat--hain't you--Democrat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Always callate to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"J-Jacksonian Democrat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess I be.\"\r\n\r\nSilence for a while, that Mr. Price may feel the gavel in his hand, which\r\nhe does.\r\n\r\n\"Know somewhat about Jacksonian principles, don't ye--know somewhat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Callate to,\" says Mr. Price, proudly.\r\n\r\n\"T-talk 'em up, Sam--t-talk 'em up. C-canvass, Sam.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words of brotherly advice Mr. Bass went off down the road, and\r\nMr. Price chopped no more wood that night; but repeated to himself many\r\ntimes in his nasal voice, \"I want to know!\" In the course of the next few\r\nweeks various gentlemen mentioned to Mr. Price that he had been spoken of\r\nfor Moderator, and he became acquainted with the names of the other\r\ncandidates on the same mysterious ticket who were mentioned. Whereupon he\r\ngirded up his loins and went forth and preached the word of Jacksonian\r\nDemocracy in all the farmhouses roundabout, with such effect that Samuel\r\nTodd and others were able to talk with some fluency about the rights of\r\nAmerican citizens.\r\n\r\nQuestion before the Committee, undisposed of: Who nominated Samuel Price\r\nfor Moderator? Samuel Price gives the evidence, tells the court he does\r\nnot know, and is duly cautioned and excused.\r\n\r\nLet us call, next, Mr. Eben Williams, if we can. Moses Hatch, Senior, has\r\nalready interrogated him with all the authority of the law and the\r\nchurch, for Mr. Williams is orthodox, though the deacons have to remind\r\nhim of his duty once in a while. Eben is timid, and replies to us, as to\r\nMoses, that he has heard of the Democratic ticket, and callates that\r\nFletcher Bartlett, who has always been the leader of the Democratic\r\nparty, has named the ticket. He did not mention Jethro Bass to Deacon\r\nHatch. Why should he? What has Jethro Bass got to do with politics?\r\n\r\nEben lives on a southern spur, next to Amos Cuthbert, where you can look\r\noff for forty miles across the billowy mountains of the west. From no\r\nspot in Coniston town is the sunset so fine on distant Farewell Mountain,\r\nand Eben's sheep feed on pastures where only mountain-bred sheep can\r\ncling and thrive. Coniston, be it known, at this time is one of the\r\nfamous wool towns of New England: before the industry went West, with\r\nother industries. But Eben Williams's sheep do not wholly belong to him\r\nthey are mortgaged--and Eben's farm is mortgaged.\r\n\r\nJethro Bass--Eben testifies to us--is in the habit of visiting him once a\r\nmonth, perhaps, when he goes to Amos Cuthbert's. Just friendly calls. Is\r\nit not a fact that Jethro Bass holds his mortgage? Yes, for eight hundred\r\ndollars. How long has he held that mortgage? About a year and a half. Has\r\nthe interest been paid promptly? Well, the fact is that Eben hasn't paid\r\nany interest yet.\r\n\r\nNow let us take the concrete incident. Before that hypocritical thaw\r\nearly in February, Jethro called upon Amos Cuthbert--not so surly then as\r\nhe has since become--and talked about buying his wool when it should be\r\nduly cut, and permitted Amos to talk about the position of second\r\nselectman, for which some person or persons unknown to the jury had\r\nnominated him. On his way down to the Four Corners, Jethro had merely\r\npulled up his sleigh before Eben Williams's house, which stood behind a\r\nhuge snow bank and practically on the road. Eben appeared at the door, a\r\nlittle dishevelled in hair and beard, for he had been sleeping.\r\n\r\n\"How be you, Jethro?\" he said nervously. Jethro nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Weather looks a mite soft.\"\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n\"About that interest,\" said Eben, plunging into the dread subject, \"don't\r\nknow as I'm ready this month after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"G-goin' to town meetin', Eben?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wahn't callatin' to,\" answered Eben.\r\n\r\n\"G-goin' to town meetin', Eben?\"\r\n\r\nEben, puzzled and dismayed, ran his hand through his hair.\r\n\r\n\"Wahn't callatin' to--but I kin--I kin.\"\r\n\r\n\"D-Democrat--hain't ye--D-Democrat?\"\r\n\r\n\"I kin be,\" said Eben. Then he looked at Jethro and added in a startled\r\nvoice, \"Don't know but what I be--Yes, I guess I be.\"\r\n\r\n\"H-heerd the ticket?\"\r\n\r\nYes, Eben had heard the ticket. What man had not. Some one has been most\r\nindustrious, and most disinterested, in distributing that ticket.\r\n\r\n\"Hain't a mite of hurry about the interest right now--right now,\" said\r\nJethro. \"M-may be along the third week in March--may be--c-can t tell.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Jethro clucked to his horse, and drove away. Eben Williams went back\r\ninto his house and sat down with his head in his hands. In about two\r\nhours, when his wife called him to fetch water, he set down the pail on\r\nthe snow and stared across the next ridge at the eastern horizon,\r\nwhitening after the sunset.\r\n\r\nThe third week in March was the week after town meeting!\r\n\r\n\"M-may be--c-can't tell,\" repeated Eben to himself, unconsciously\r\nimitating Jethro's stutter. \"Godfrey, I'll hev to git that ticket\r\nstraight from Amos.\"\r\n\r\nYes, we may have our suspicions. But how can we get a bill on this\r\nevidence? There are some thirty other individuals in Coniston whose\r\nmortgages Jethro holds, from a horse to a house and farm. It is not\r\nlikely that they will tell Beacon Hatch, or us; that they are going to\r\ntown meeting and vote for that fatherless ticket because Jethro Bass\r\nwishes them to do so. And Jethro has never said that he wishes them to.\r\nIf so, where are your witnesses? Have we not come back to our\r\nstarting-point, even as Moses Hatch drove around in a circle.. And we\r\nhave the advantage over Moses, for we suspect somebody, and he did not\r\nknow whom to suspect. Certainly not Jethro Bass, the man that lived under\r\nhis nose and never said anything--and had no right to. Jethro Bass had\r\nnever taken any active part in politics, though some folks had heard, in\r\nhis rounds on business, that he had discussed them, and had spread the\r\nnews of the infamous ticket without a parent. So much was spoken of at\r\nthe meeting over which Priest Ware prayed. It was even declared that,\r\nbeing a Democrat, Jethro might have influenced some of those under\r\nobligations to him. Sam Price was at last fixed upon as the malefactor,\r\nthough people agreed that they had not given him credit for so much\r\nsense, and Jacksonian principles became as much abhorred by the orthodox\r\nas the spotted fever.\r\n\r\nWe can call a host of other witnesses if we like, among them cranky,\r\nhappy-go-lucky Fletcher Bartlett, who has led forlorn hopes in former\r\nyears. Court proceedings make tiresome reading, and if those who have\r\nbeen over ours have not arrived at some notion of the simple and innocent\r\nmethod of the new Era of politics note dawning--they never will. Nothing\r\nproved. But here is part of the ticket which nobody started:--\r\n\r\n     For\r\n\r\n     SENIOR SELECTMAN, FLETCHER BARTLETT.\r\n\r\n     (Farm and buildings on Thousand Acre Hill mortgaged to Jethro\r\n     Bass.)\r\n\r\n     SECOND SELECTMAN, AMOS CUTHBERT.\r\n\r\n     (Farm and buildings on Town's End Ridge mortgaged to Jethro\r\n     Bass.)\r\n\r\n     THIRD SELECTMAN, CHESTER PERKINS.\r\n\r\n     (Sop of some kind to the Established Church party. Horse and\r\n     cow mortgaged to Jethro Bass, though his father, the tithing-man,\r\ndoesn't know  it.)\r\n\r\n     MODERATOR, SAMUEL PRICE.\r\n\r\n     (Natural ambition--dove of oratory and Jacksonian principles.)\r\n\r\n     etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThe notes are mine, not Moses's. Strange that they didn't occur to Moses.\r\nWhat a wealthy man has our hero become at thirty-one! Jethro Bass was\r\nrich beyond the dreams of avarice--for Coniston. Truth compels me to\r\nadmit that the sum total of all his mortgages did not amount to nine\r\nthousand \"dollars\"; but that was a large sum of money for Coniston in\r\nthose days, and even now. Nathan Bass had been a saving man, and had left\r\nto his son one-half of this fortune. If thrift and the ability to gain\r\nwealth be qualities for a hero, Jethro had them--in those days.\r\n\r\nThe Sunday before March meeting, it blew bitter cold, and Priest Ware,\r\npreaching in mittens, denounced sedition in general. Underneath him, on\r\nthe first landing of the high pulpit, the deacons sat with knitted brows,\r\nand the key-note from Isaiah Prescott's pitch pipe sounded like mournful\r\necho of the mournful wind without.\r\n\r\nMonday was ushered in with that sleet storm to which the almanacs still\r\nrefer, and another scarcely less important event occurred that day which\r\nwe shall have to pass by for the present; on Tuesday, the sleet still\r\nraging, came the historic town meeting. Deacon Moses Hatch, his chores\r\ndone and his breakfast and prayers completed, fought his way with his\r\nhead down through a white waste to the meeting-house door, and unlocked\r\nit, and shivered as he made the fire. It was certainly not good election\r\nweather, thought Moses, and others of the orthodox persuasion, high in\r\noffice, were of the same opinion as they stood with parted coat tails\r\nbefore the stove. Whoever had stirred up and organized the hordes,\r\nwhoever was the author of that ticket of the discontented, had not\r\ncounted upon the sleet. Heaven-sent sleet, said Deacon Ira Perkins, and\r\nwould not speak to his son Chester, who sat down just then in one of the\r\nrear slips. Chester had become an agitator, a Jacksonian Democrat, and an\r\noutcast, to be prayed for but not spoken to.\r\n\r\nWe shall leave them their peace of mind for half an hour more, those\r\nstanch old deacons and selectmen, who did their duty by their\r\nfellow-citizens as they saw it and took no man's bidding. They could not\r\nsee the trackless roads over the hills, now becoming tracked, and the\r\nbent figures driving doggedly against the storm, each impelled by a\r\nmotive: each motive strengthened by a master mind until it had become\r\nimperative. Some, like Eben Williams behind his rickety horse, came\r\nthrough fear; others through ambition; others were actuated by both; and\r\nstill others were stung by the pain of the sleet to a still greater\r\njealousy and envy, and the remembrance of those who had been in power. I\r\nmust not omit the conscientious Jacksonians who were misguided enough to\r\nbelieve in such a ticket.\r\n\r\nThe sheds were not large enough to hold the teams that day. Jethro's barn\r\nand tannery were full, and many other barns in the village. And now the\r\npeace of mind of the orthodox is a thing of the past. Deacon Lysander\r\nRichardson, the moderator, sits aghast in his high place as they come\r\ntrooping in, men who have not been to town meeting for ten years. Deacon\r\nLysander, with his white band of whiskers that goes around his neck like\r\na sixteenth-century ruff under his chin, will soon be a memory. Now\r\nenters one, if Deacon Lysander had known it symbolic of the new Era. One\r\nwho, though his large head is bent, towers over most of the men who make\r\nway for him in the aisle, nodding but not speaking, and takes his place\r\nin the chair under the platform on the right of the meeting-pause under\r\none of the high, three-part windows. That chair was always his in future\r\nyears, and there he sat afterward, silent, apparently taking no part. But\r\nnot a man dropped a ballot into the box whom Jethro Bass did not see and\r\nmark.\r\n\r\nAnd now, when the meeting-house is crowded as it has never been before,\r\nwhen Jonah Winch has arranged his dinner booth in the corner, Deacon\r\nLysander raps for order and the minister prays. They proceed, first, to\r\nelect a representative to the General Court. The Jacksonians do not\r\ncontest that seat,--this year,--and Isaiah Prescott, fourteenth child of\r\nTimothy, the Stark hero, father of a young Ephraim whom we shall hear\r\nfrom later, is elected. And now! Now for a sensation, now for disorder\r\nand misrule!\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" says Deacon Lysander, \"you will prepare your ballots for the\r\nchoice of the first Selectman.\"\r\n\r\nThe Whigs have theirs written out, Deacon Moses Hatch. But who has\r\nwritten out these others that are being so assiduously passed around? Sam\r\nPrice, perhaps, for he is passing them most assiduously. And what name is\r\nwritten on them? Fletcher Bartlett, of course; that was on the ticket.\r\nSomebody is tricked again. That is not the name on the ticket. Look over\r\nSara Price's shoulder and you will see the name--Jethro Bass.\r\n\r\nIt bursts from the lips of Fletcher Bartlett himself--of Fletcher,\r\ninflammable as gunpowder.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, I withdraw as your candidate, and nominate a better and an\r\nabler man,--Jethro Bass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jethro Bass for Chairman of the Selectmen!\"\r\n\r\nThe cry is taken up all over the meeting-house, and rises high above the\r\nhiss of the sleet on the great windows. Somebody's got on the stove, to\r\nadd to the confusion and horror. The only man in the whole place who is\r\nnot excited is Jethro Bass himself, who sits in his chair regardless of\r\nthose pressing around him. Many years afterward he confessed to some one\r\nthat he was surprised--and this is true. Fletcher Bartlett had surprised\r\nand tricked him, but was forgiven. Forty men are howling at the\r\nmoderator, who is pounding on the table with a blacksmith's blows. Squire\r\nAsa Northcutt, with his arms fanning like a windmill from the edge of the\r\nplatform, at length shouts down everybody else--down to a hum. Some\r\nlisten to him: hear the words \"infamous outrage\"--\"if Jethro Bass is\r\nelected Selectman, Coniston will never be able to hold up her head among\r\nher sister towns for very shame.\" (Momentary blank, for somebody has got\r\non the stove again, a scuffle going on there.) \"I see it all now,\" says\r\nthe Squire--(marvel of perspicacity!) \"Jethro Bass has debased and\r\ndebauched this town--\" (blank again, and the squire points a finger of\r\nrage and scorn at the unmoved offender in the chair) \"he has bought and\r\nintimidated men to do his bidding. He has sinned against heaven, and\r\nagainst the spirit of that most immortal of documents--\" (Blank again.\r\nMost unfortunate blank, for this is becoming oratory, but somebody from\r\nbelow has seized the squire by the leg.) Squire Northcutt is too\r\ndignified and elderly a person to descend to rough and tumble, but he did\r\nget his leg liberated and kicked Fletcher Bartlett in the face. Oh,\r\nConiston, that such scenes should take place in your town meeting! By\r\nthis time another is orating, Mr. Sam Price, Jackson Democrat. There was\r\nno shorthand reporter in Coniston in those days, and it is just as well,\r\nperhaps, that the accusations and recriminations should sink into\r\noblivion.\r\n\r\nAt last, by mighty efforts of the peace loving in both parties, something\r\nlike order is restored, the ballots are in the box, and Deacon Lysander\r\nis counting them: not like another moderator I have heard of, who spilled\r\nthe votes on the floor until his own man was elected. No. Had they\r\nregistered his own death sentence, the deacon would have counted them\r\nstraight, and needed no town clerk to verify his figures. But when he\r\ncame to pronounce the vote, shame and sorrow and mortification overcame\r\nhim. Coniston, his native town, which he had served and revered, was\r\ndishonored, and it was for him, Lysander Richardson, to proclaim her\r\ndisgrace. The deacon choked, and tears of bitterness stood in his eyes,\r\nand there came a silence only broken by the surging of the sleet as he\r\nrapped on the table.\r\n\r\n\"Seventy-five votes have been cast for Jethro Bass--sixty-three for Moses\r\nHatch. Necessary for a choice, seventy--and Jethro Bass is elected senior\r\nSelectman.\"\r\n\r\nThe deacon sat down, and men say that a great sob shook him, while\r\nJacksonian Democracy went wild--not looking into future years to see what\r\nthey were going wild about. Jethro Bass Chairman of the Board of\r\nSelectmen, in the honored place of Deacon Moses Hatch! Bourbon royalists\r\nnever looked with greater abhorrence on the Corsican adventurer and\r\nusurper of the throne than did the orthodox in Coniston on this tanner,\r\nwho had earned no right to aspire to any distinction, and who by his\r\nwiles had acquired the highest office in the town government. Fletcher\r\nBartlett in, as a leader of the irresponsible opposition, would have been\r\ncalamity enough. But Jethro Bass!\r\n\r\nThis man whom they had despised was the master mind who had organized and\r\nmarshalled the loose vote, was the author of that ticket, who sat in his\r\ncorner unmoved alike by the congratulations of his friends and the\r\nmaledictions of his enemies; who rose to take his oath of office as\r\nunconcerned as though the house were empty, albeit Deacon Lysander could\r\nscarcely get the words out. And then Jethro sat down again in his\r\nchair--not to leave it for six and thirty years. From this time forth\r\nthat chair became a seat of power, and of dominion over a state.\r\n\r\nThus it was that Jock Hallowell's prophecy, so lightly uttered, came to\r\npass.\r\n\r\nHow the remainder of that Jacksonian ticket was elected, down to the very\r\nhog-reeves, and amid what turmoil of the Democracy and bitterness of\r\nspirit of the orthodox, I need not recount. There is no moral to the\r\nstory, alas--it was one of those things which inscrutable heaven\r\npermitted to be done. After that dark town-meeting day some of those\r\nstern old fathers became broken men, and it is said in Coniston that this\r\ncalamity to righteous government, and not the storm, gave to Priest Ware\r\nhis death-stroke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nAnd now we must go back for a chapter--a very short chapter--to the day\r\nbefore that town meeting which had so momentous an influence upon the\r\nhistory of Coniston and of the state. That Monday, too, it will be\r\nremembered, dawned in storm, the sleet hissing in the wide throats of the\r\ncentre-chimneys, and bearing down great boughs of trees until they broke\r\nin agony. Dusk came early, and howling darkness that hid a muffled figure\r\non the ice-bound road staring at the yellow cracks in the tannery door.\r\nPresently the figure crossed the yard; the door, flying open, released a\r\nshaft of light that shot across the white ground, revealed a face beneath\r\na hood to him who stood within.\r\n\r\n\"Jethro!\"\r\n\r\nShe darted swiftly past him, seizing the door and drawing it closed after\r\nher. A lantern hung on the central post and flung its rays upon his face.\r\nHer own, mercifully, was in the shadow, and burning now with a shame that\r\nwas insupportable. Now that she was there, beside him, her strength\r\nfailed her, and her courage--courage that she had been storing for this\r\ndread undertaking throughout the whole of that dreadful day. Now that she\r\nwas there, she would have given her life to have been able to retrace her\r\nsteps, to lose herself in the wild, dark places of the mountain.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthy!\" His voice betrayed the passion which her presence had\r\nquickened.\r\n\r\nThe words she would have spoken would not come. She could think of\r\nnothing but that she was alone with him, and in bodily terror of him. She\r\nturned to the door again, to grasp the wooden latch; but he barred the\r\nway, and she fell back.\r\n\r\n\"Let me go,\" she cried. \"I did not mean to come. Do you hear?--let me\r\ngo!\"\r\n\r\nTo her amazement he stepped aside--a most unaccountable action for him.\r\nMore unaccountable still, she did not move, now that she was free, but\r\nstood poised for flight, held by she knew not what.\r\n\r\n\"G-go if you've a mind to, Cynthy--if you've a mind to.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've come to say something to you,\" she faltered. It was not, at all the\r\nway she had pictured herself as saying it.\r\n\r\n\"H-haven't took' Moses--have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she cried, \"do you think I came here to speak of such a thing as\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"H-haven't took--Moses, have you?\"\r\n\r\nShe was trembling, and yet she could almost have smiled at this\r\nwell-remembered trick of pertinacity.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said, and immediately hated herself for answering him.\r\n\r\n\"H-haven't took that Worthington cuss?\"\r\n\r\nHe was jealous!\r\n\r\n\"I didn't come to discuss Mr. Worthington,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"Folks say it's only a matter of time,\" said he. \"Made up your mind to\r\ntake him, Cynthy? M-made up your mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"You've no right to talk to me in this way,\" she said, and added, the\r\nwords seeming to slip of themselves from her lips, \"Why do you do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I'm--interested,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"You haven't shown it,\" she flashed back, forgetting the place, and the\r\nstorm, and her errand even, forgetting that Jake Wheeler, or any one in\r\nConiston, might come and surprise her there.\r\n\r\nHe took a step toward her, and she retreated. The light struck her face,\r\nand he bent over her as though searching it for a sign. The cape on her\r\nshoulders rose and fell as she breathed.\r\n\r\n\"'Twahn't charity, Cynthy--was it? 'Twahn't charity?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was you who called it such,\" she answered, in a low voice.\r\n\r\nA sleet-charged gust hurled itself against the door, and the lantern\r\nflickered.\r\n\r\n\"Wahn't it charity.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was friendship, Jethro. You ought to have known that, and you should\r\nnot have brought back the book.\"\r\n\r\n\"Friendship,\" he repeated, \"y-you said friendship?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"M-meant friendship?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Cynthia, but more faintly, and yet with a certain delicious\r\nfright as she glanced at him shyly. Surely there had never been a\r\nstranger man! Now he was apparently in a revery.\r\n\r\n\"G-guess it's because I'm not good enough to be anything more,\" he\r\nremarked suddenly. \"Is that it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have not tried even to be a friend,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"H-how about Worthington?\" he persisted. \"Just friends with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't talk about Mr. Worthington,\" cried Cynthia, desperately, and\r\nretreated toward the lantern again.\r\n\r\n\"J-just friends with Worthington?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" she asked, her words barely heard above the gust, \"why do you want\r\nto know?\"\r\n\r\nHe came after her. It was as if she had summoned some unseen,\r\nuncontrollable power, only to be appalled by it, and the mountain-storm\r\nwithout seemed the symbol of it. His very voice seemed to partake of its\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthy,\" he said, \"if you'd took him, I'd have killed him. Cynthy, I\r\nlove you--I want you to be my woman--\"\r\n\r\n\"Your woman!\"\r\n\r\nHe caught her, struggling wildly, terror-stricken, in his arms, beat down\r\nher hands, flung back her hood, and kissed her forehead--her hair, blown\r\nby the wind--her lips. In that moment she felt the mystery of heaven and\r\nhell, of all kinds of power. In that moment she was like a seed flying in\r\nthe storm above the mountain spruces whither, she knew not, cared not.\r\nThere was one thought that drifted across the chaos like a blue light of\r\nthe spirit: Could she control the storm? Could she say whither the winds\r\nmight blow, where the seed might be planted? Then she found herself\r\nlistening, struggling no longer, for he held her powerless. Strangest of\r\nall, most hopeful of all, his own mind was working, though his soul\r\nrocked with passion.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthy--ever since we stopped that day on the road in Northcutt's woods,\r\nI've thought of nothin' but to marry you--m-marry you. Then you give me\r\nthat book--I hain't had much education, but it come across me if you was\r\nto help me that way--And when I seed you with Worthington, I could have\r\nkilled him easy as breakin' bark.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, Jethro.\"\r\n\r\nShe struggled free and leaped away from him, panting, while he tore open\r\nhis coat and drew forth something which gleamed in the lantern's rays--a\r\nsilver locket. Cynthia scarcely saw it. Her blood was throbbing in her\r\ntemples, she could not reason, but she knew that the appeal for the sake\r\nof which she had stooped must be delivered now.\r\n\r\n\"Jethro,\" she said, \"do you know why I came here--why I came to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said. \"No. W--wanted me, didn't you? Wanted me--I wanted you,\r\nCynthy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would never have come to you for that,\" she cried, \"never!\"\r\n\r\n\"L-love me, Cynthy--love me, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nHow could he ask, seeing that she had been in his arms, and had not fled?\r\nAnd yet she must go through with what she had come to do, at any cost.\r\n\r\n\"Jethro, I have come to speak to you about the town meeting tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nHe halted as though he had been struck, his hand tightening over the\r\nlocket.\r\n\r\n\"T-town meetin'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. All this new organization is your doing,\" she cried. \"Do you think\r\nthat I am foolish enough to believe that Fletcher Bartlett or Sam Price\r\nplanned this thing? No, Jethro. I know who has done it, and I could have\r\ntold them if they had asked me.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, and the light of a new admiration was in his eye.\r\n\r\n\"Knowed it--did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she answered, a little defiantly, \"I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"H-how'd you know it--how'd you know it, Cynthy?\" How did she know it,\r\nindeed?\r\n\r\n\"I guessed it,\" said Cynthia, desperately, \"knowing you, I guessed it.\"\r\n\r\n\"A-always thought you was smart, Cynthy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, did you do this thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Th-thought you knowed it--th-thought you knowed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe that these men are doing your bidding.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hain't you guessin' a little mite too much; Cynthy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jethro,\" she said, \"you told me just now that--that you loved me. Don't\r\ntouch me!\" she cried, when he would have taken her in his arms again. \"If\r\nyou love me, you will tell me why you have done such a thing.\"\r\n\r\nWhat instinct there was in the man which forbade him speaking out to her,\r\nI know not. I do believe that he would have confessed, if he could. Isaac\r\nWorthington had been impelled to reveal his plans and aspirations, but\r\nJethro Bass was as powerless in this supreme moment of his life as was\r\nConiston Mountain to move the granite on which it stood. Cynthia's heart\r\nsank, and a note of passionate appeal came into her voice.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jethro!\" she cried, \"this is not the way to use your power, to\r\ncompel men like Eben Williams and Samuel Todd and--and Lyman Hull, who is\r\na drunkard and a vagabond, to come in and vote for those who are not fit\r\nto hold office.\" She was using the minister's own arguments. \"We have\r\nalways had clean men, and honorable and good men.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not speak, but dropped his hands to his sides. His thoughts were\r\nnot to be fathomed, yet Cynthia took the movement for silent\r\nconfession,--which it was not, and stood appalled at the very magnitude\r\nof his accomplishment, astonished at the secrecy he had maintained. She\r\nhad heard that his name had been mentioned in the meeting at the house of\r\nMoses Hatch as having taken part in the matter, and she guessed something\r\nof certain of his methods. But she had felt his force, and knew that this\r\nwas not the only secret of his power.\r\n\r\nWhat might he not aspire to, if properly guided? No, she did not believe\r\nhim to be, unscrupulous--but merely ignorant: a man who was capable of\r\nsuch love as she felt was in him, a man whom she could love, could not\r\nmean to be unscrupulous. Defence of him leaped to her own lips.\r\n\r\n\"You did not know what you were doing,\" she said. \"I was sure of it, or I\r\nwould not have come to you. Oh, Jethro! you must stop it--you must\r\nprevent this election.\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes met his, her own pleading, and the very wind without seemed to\r\npause for his answer. But what she asked was impossible. That wind which\r\nhe himself had loosed, which was to topple over institutions, was rising,\r\nand he could no more have stopped it then than he could have hushed the\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\n\"You will not do what I ask--now?\" she said, very slowly. Then her voice\r\nfailed her, she drew her hands together, and it was as if her heart had\r\nceased to beat. Sorrow and anger and fierce shame overwhelmed her, and\r\nshe turned from him in silence and went to the door.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthy,\" he cried hoarsely, \"Cynthy!\"\r\n\r\n\"You must never speak to me again,\" she said, and was gone into the\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nYes, she had failed. But she did not know that she had left something\r\nbehind which he treasured as long as he lived.\r\n\r\nIn the spring, when the new leaves were green on the slopes of Coniston,\r\nPriest Ware ended a life of faithful service. The high pulpit, taken from\r\nthe old meeting house, and the cricket on which he used to stand and the\r\nBible from which he used to preach have remained objects of veneration in\r\nConiston to this day. A fortnight later many tearful faces gazed after\r\nthe Truro coach as it galloped out of Brampton in a cloud of dust, and\r\none there was watching unseen from the spruces on the hill, who saw\r\nwithin it a girl dressed in black, dry-eyed, staring from the window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nOut of the stump of a blasted tree in the Coniston woods a flower will\r\nsometimes grow, and even so the story which I have now to tell springs\r\nfrom the love of Cynthia Ware and Jethro Bass. The flower, when it came\r\nto bloom, was fair in life, and I hope that in these pages it will not\r\nlose too much of its beauty and sweetness.\r\n\r\nFor a little while we are going to gallop through the years as before we\r\nhave ambled through the days, although the reader's breath may be taken\r\naway in the process. How Cynthia Ware went over the Truro Pass to Boston,\r\nand how she became a teacher in a high school there;--largely through the\r\nkindness of that Miss Lucretia Penniman of whom we have spoken, who wrote\r\nin Cynthia's behalf to certain friends she had in that city; how she met\r\none William Wetherell, no longer a clerk in Mr. Judson's jewellery shop,\r\nbut a newspaper man with I know not what ambitions--and limitations in\r\nstrength of body and will; how, many, many years afterward, she nursed\r\nhim tenderly through a sickness and--married him, is all told in a\r\nparagraph. Marry him she did, to take care of him, and told him so. She\r\nmade no secret of the maternal in this love.\r\n\r\nOne evening, the summer after their marriage, they were walking in the\r\nMall under the great elms that border the Common on the Tremont Street\r\nside. They often used to wander there, talking of the books he was to\r\nwrite when strength should come and a little leisure, and sometimes their\r\nglances would linger longingly on Colonnade Row that Bulfinch built\r\nacross the way, where dwelt the rich and powerful of the city--and yet he\r\nwould not have exchanged their lot for his. Could he have earned with his\r\nown hands such a house, and sit Cynthia there in glory, what happiness!\r\nBut, I stray.\r\n\r\nThey were walking in the twilight, for the sun had sunk all red in the\r\nmarshes of the Charles, when there chanced along a certain Mr. Judson, a\r\njeweller, taking the air likewise. So there came into Wetherell's mind\r\nthat amusing adventure with the country lad and the locket. His name, by\r\nreason of some strange quality in it, he had never forgotten, and\r\nsuddenly he recalled that the place the countryman had come from was\r\nConiston.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia,\" said her husband, when Mr. Judson was gone, \"did you know any\r\none in Coniston named Jethro Bass?\"\r\n\r\nShe did not answer him. And, thinking she had not heard, he spoke again.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you ask?\" she said, in a low tone, without looking at him.\r\n\r\nHe told her the story. Not until the end of it did the significance of\r\nthe name engraved come to him--Cynthy.\r\n\r\n\"Cynthy, from Jethro.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it might have been you!\" he said jestingly. \"Was he an admirer of\r\nyours, Cynthia, that strange, uncouth countryman? Did he give you the\r\nlocket?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she answered, \"he never did.\"\r\n\r\nWetherell glanced at her in surprise, and saw that her lip was quivering,\r\nthat tears were on her lashes. She laid her hand on his arm.\r\n\r\n\"William,\" she said, drawing him to a bench, \"come, let us sit down, and\r\nI will tell you the story of Jethro Bass. We have been happy together,\r\nyou and I, for I have found peace with you. I have tried to be honest\r\nwith you, William, and I will always be so. I told you before we were\r\nmarried that I loved another man. I have tried to forget him, but as God\r\nis my judge, I cannot. I believe I shall love him until I die.\"\r\n\r\nThey sat in the summer twilight, until darkness fell, and the lights\r\ngleamed through the leaves, and a deep, cool breath coming up from the\r\nsea stirred the leaves above their heads. That she should have loved\r\nJethro seemed as strange to her as to him, and yet Wetherell was to feel\r\nthe irresistible force of him. Hers was not a love that she chose, or\r\nwould have chosen, but something elemental that cried out from the man to\r\nher, and drew her. Something that had in it now, as of yore, much of pain\r\nand even terror, but drew her. Strangest of all was that William\r\nWetherell understood and was not jealous of this thing: which leads us to\r\nbelieve that some essence of virility was lacking in him, some substance\r\nthat makes the fighters and conquerors in this world. In such mood he\r\nlistened to the story of Jethro Bass.\r\n\r\n\"My dear husband,\" said Cynthia, when she had finished, her hand\r\ntightening over his, \"I have never told you this for fear that it might\r\ntrouble you as it has troubled me. I have found in your love sanctuary;\r\nand all that remains of myself I have given to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have found a weakling to protect, and an invalid to nurse,\" he\r\nanswered. \"To have your compassion, Cynthia, is all I crave.\"\r\n\r\nSo they lived through the happiest and swiftest years of his life,\r\nworking side by side, sharing this strange secret between them. And after\r\nthat night Cynthia talked to him often of Coniston, until he came to know\r\nthe mountain that lay along the western sky, and the sweet hillsides by\r\nConiston Water under the blue haze of autumn, aye, and clothed in the\r\ncolors of spring, the bright blossoms of thorn and apple against the\r\ntender green of the woods and fields. So he grew to love the simple\r\npeople there, but little did he foresee that he was to end his life among\r\nthem!\r\n\r\nBut so it came to pass, she was taken from him, who had been the one joy\r\nand inspiration of his weary days, and he was driven, wandering, into\r\nunfrequented streets that he might not recall, the places where she had\r\nonce trod, and through the wakeful nights her voice haunted him,--its\r\nlaughter, its sweet notes of seriousness; little ways and manners of her\r\nlook came to twist his heart, and he prayed God to take him, too, until\r\nit seemed that Cynthia frowned upon him for his weakness. One mild Sunday\r\nafternoon, he took little Cynthia by the hand and led her, toddling, out\r\ninto the sunny Common, where he used to walk with her mother, and the\r\ninfant prattle seemed to bring--at last a strange peace to his\r\nstorm-tossed soul.\r\n\r\nFor many years these Sunday walks in the Common were Wetherell's greatest\r\npleasure and solace, and it seemed as though little Cynthia had come into\r\nthe world with an instinct, as it were, of her mission that lent to her\r\ninfant words a sweet gravity and weight. Many people used to stop and\r\nspeak to the child, among them a great physician whom they grew to know.\r\nHe was, there every Sunday, and at length it came to be a habit with him\r\nto sit down on the bench and take Cynthia on his knee, and his stern face\r\nwould soften as he talked to her.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday when Cynthia was eight years old he missed them, and the next,\r\nand at dusk he strode into their little lodging behind the hill and up to\r\nthe bedside. He glanced at Wetherell, patting Cynthia on the head the\r\nwhile, and bade her cheerily to go out of the room. But she held tight\r\nhold of her father's hand and looked up at the doctor bravely.\r\n\r\n\"I am taking care of my father,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"So you shall, little woman,\" he answered. \"I would that we had such\r\nnurses as you at the hospital. Why didn't you send for me at once?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"Bless her good sense;\" said the doctor; \"she has more than you,\r\nWetherell. Why didn't you take her advice? If your father does not do as\r\nI tell him, he will be a very sick man indeed. He must go into the\r\ncountry and stay there.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I must live, Doctor,\" said William Wetherell.\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked at Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"You will not live if you stay here,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Then he will go,\" said Cynthia, so quietly that he gave her another\r\nlook, strange and tender and comprehending. He, sat and talked of many\r\nthings: of the great war that was agonizing the nation; of the strong man\r\nwho, harassed and suffering himself, was striving to guide it, likening\r\nLincoln unto a physician. So the doctor was wont to take the minds of\r\npatients from themselves. And before he left he gave poor Wetherell a\r\nfortnight to decide.\r\n\r\nAs he lay on his back in that room among the chimney tops trying vainly\r\nto solve the problem of how he was to earn his salt in the country, a\r\nvisitor was climbing the last steep flight of stairs. That visitor was\r\nnone other than Sergeant Ephraim Prescott, son of Isaiah of the\r\npitch-pipe, and own cousin of Cynthia Ware's. Sergeant Ephraim was just\r\nhome from the war and still clad in blue, and he walked with a slight\r\nlimp by reason of a bullet he had got in the Wilderness, and he had such\r\nan honest, genial face that little Cynthia was on his knee in a moment.\r\n\r\n\"How be you, Will? Kind of poorly, I callate. So Cynthy's b'en took,\" he\r\nsaid sadly. \"Always thought a sight of Cynthy. Little Cynthy favors her\r\nsome. Yes, thought I'd drop in and see how you be on my way home.\"\r\n\r\nSergeant Ephraim had much to say about the great war, and about Coniston.\r\nTrue to the instincts of the blood of the Stark hero, he had left the\r\nplough and the furrow' at the first call, forty years of age though he\r\nwas. But it had been otherwise with many in Coniston and Brampton and\r\nHarwich. Some of these, when the drafting came, had fled in bands to the\r\nmountain and defied capture. Mr. Dudley Worthington, now a mill owner,\r\nhad found a substitute; Heth Sutton of Clovelly had been drafted and had\r\ndriven over the mountain to implore Jethro Bass abjectly to get him out\r\nof it. In short, many funny things had happened--funny things to Sergeant\r\nEphraim, but not at all to William Wetherell, who sympathized with Heth\r\nin his panic.\r\n\r\n\"So Jethro Bass has become a great man,\" said Wetherell.\r\n\r\n\"Great!\" Ephraim ejaculated. \"Guess he's the biggest man in the state\r\nto-day. Queer how he got his power began twenty-four years ago when I\r\nwahn't but twenty. I call that town meetin' to mind as if 'twas yesterday\r\nnever was such an upset. Jethro's be'n first Selectman ever sense, though\r\nhe turned Republican in '60. Old folks don't fancy Jethro's kind of\r\npolitics much, but times change. Jethro saved my life, I guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Saved your life!\" exclaimed Wetherell.\r\n\r\n\"Got me a furlough,\" said Ephraim. \"Guess I would have died in the\r\nhospital if he hadn't got it so all-fired quick, and he druv down to\r\nBrampton to fetch me back. You'd have thought I was General Grant the way\r\nfolks treated me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You went back to the war after your leg healed?\" Wetherell asked, in\r\nwondering admiration of the man's courage.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Ephraim, simply, \"the other boys was gettin' full of bullets\r\nand dysentery, and it didn't seem just right. The leg troubles me some on\r\nwet days, but not to amount to much. You hain't thinkin' of dyin'\r\nyourself, be ye, William?\"\r\n\r\nWilliam was thinking very seriously of it, but it was Cynthia who spoke,\r\nand startled them both.\r\n\r\n\"The doctor says he will die if he doesn't go to the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Somethin' like consumption, William?\" asked Ephraim.\r\n\r\n\"So the doctor said.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I callated,\" said Ephraim. \"Come back to Coniston with me; there\r\nhain't a healthier place in New England.\"\r\n\r\n\"How could I support myself in Coniston?\" Wetherell asked.\r\n\r\nEphraim ruminated. Suddenly he stuck his hand into the bosom of his blue\r\ncoat, and his face lighted and even gushed as he drew out a crumpled\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n\"It don't take much gumption to run a store, does it, William? Guess you\r\ncould run a store, couldn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would try anything,\" said Wetherell.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Ephraim' \"there's the store at Coniston. With folks goin'\r\nWest, and all that, nobody seems to want it much.\" He looked at the\r\nletter. \"Lem Hallowell' says there hain't nobody to take it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jonah Winch's!\" exclaimed Wetherell.\r\n\r\n\"Jonah made it go, but that was before all this hullabaloo about\r\nTemperance Cadets and what not. Jonah sold good rum, but now you can't\r\nget nothin' in Coniston but hard cider and potato whiskey. Still, it's\r\nthe place for somebody without much get-up,\" and he eyed his cousin by\r\nmarriage. \"Better come and try it, William.\"\r\n\r\nSo much for dreams! Instead of a successor to Irving and Emerson, William\r\nWetherell became a successor to Jonah Winch.\r\n\r\nThat journey to Coniston was full of wonder to Cynthia, and of wonder and\r\nsadness to Wetherell, for it was the way his other Cynthia had come to\r\nBoston. From the state capital the railroad followed the same deep valley\r\nas the old coach road, but ended at Truro, and then they took stage over\r\nTruro Pass for Brampton, where honest Ephraim awaited them and their\r\nslender luggage with a team. Brampton, with its wide-shadowed green, and\r\nterrace-steepled church; home once of the Social Library and Lucretia\r\nPenniman, now famous; home now of Isaac Dudley Worthington, whose great\r\nmills the stage driver had pointed out to them on Coniston Water as they\r\nentered the town.\r\n\r\nThen came a drive through the cool evening to Coniston, Ephraim showing\r\nthem landmarks. There was Deacon Lysander's house, where little Rias\r\nRichardson lived now; and on that slope and hidden in its forest nook,\r\namong the birches and briers, the little schoolhouse where Cynthia had\r\nlearned to spell; here, where the road made an aisle in the woods, she\r\nhad met Jethro. The choir of the birds was singing an evening anthem now\r\nas then, to the lower notes of Coniston Water, and the moist, hothouse\r\nfragrance of the ferns rose from the deep places.\r\n\r\nAt last they came suddenly upon the little hamlet of Coniston itself.\r\nThere was the flagpole and the triangular green, scene of many a muster;\r\nJonah Winch's store, with its horse block and checker-paned windows, just\r\nas Jonah had left it; Nathan Bass's tannery shed, now weather-stained and\r\nneglected, for Jethro lived on Thousand Acre Hill now; the Prescott\r\nhouse, home of the Stark hero, where Ephraim lived, \"innocent of paint\"\r\n(as one of Coniston's sons has put it), \"innocent of paint as a Coniston\r\nmaiden's face\"; the white meeting-house, where Priest Ware had\r\npreached--and the parsonage. Cynthia and Wetherell loitered in front of\r\nit, while the blue shadow of the mountain deepened into night, until Mr.\r\nSatterlee, the minister, found them there, and they went in and stood\r\nreverently in the little chamber on the right of the door, which had been\r\nCynthia's.\r\n\r\nLong Wetherell lay awake that night, in his room at the gable-end over\r\nthe store, listening to the rustling of the great oak beside the windows,\r\nto the whippoorwills calling across Coniston Water. But at last a peace\r\ndescended upon him, and he slept: yes, and awoke with the same sense of\r\npeace at little Cynthia's touch, to go out into the cool morning, when\r\nthe mountain side was in myriad sheens of green under the rising sun.\r\nBehind the store was an old-fashioned garden, set about by a neat stone\r\nwall, hidden here and there by the masses of lilac and currant bushes,\r\nand at the south of it was a great rose-covered boulder of granite. And\r\nbeyond, through the foliage of the willows and the low apple trees which\r\nJonah Winch had set out, Coniston Water gleamed and tumbled. Under an\r\narching elm near the house was the well, stone-rimmed, with its long pole\r\nand crotch, and bucket all green with the damp moss which clung to it.\r\n\r\nEphraim Prescott had been right when he had declared that it did not take\r\nmuch gumption to keep store in Coniston. William Wetherell merely assumed\r\ncertain obligations at the Brampton bank, and Lem Hallowell, Jock's son,\r\nwho now drove the Brampton stage, brought the goods to the door. Little\r\nRias Richardson was willing to come in, and help move the barrels, and on\r\nsuch occasions wore carpet slippers to save his shoes. William still had\r\ntime for his books; in that Coniston air he began to feel stronger, and\r\nto wonder whether he might not be a Washington Irving yet. And yet he had\r\none worry and one fear, and both of these concerned one man,--Jethro\r\nBass. Him, by her own confession, Cynthia Ware had loved to her dying\r\nday, hating herself for it: and he, William Wetherell, had married this\r\nwoman whom Jethro had loved so violently, and must always love--so\r\nWetherell thought: that was the worry. How would Jethro treat him? that\r\nwas the fear. William Wetherell was not the most courageous man in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nJethro Bass had not been in Coniston since William's arrival. No need to\r\nask where he was. Jake Wheeler, Jethro's lieutenant in Coniston, gave\r\nWilliam a glowing account of that Throne Room in the Pelican Hotel at the\r\ncapital, from whence Jethro ruled the state during the sessions of the\r\nGeneral Court. This legislature sat to him as a sort of advisory\r\ncommittee of three hundred and fifty: an expensive advisory committee to\r\nthe people, relic of an obsolete form of government. Many stories of the\r\nnow all-powerful Jethro William heard from the little coterie which made\r\ntheir headquarters in his store--stories of how those methods of which we\r\nhave read were gradually spread over other towns and other counties. Not\r\nthat Jethro held mortgages in these towns and counties, but the local\r\nlieutenants did, and bowed to him as an overlord. There were funny\r\nstories, and grim stories of vengeance which William Wetherell heard and\r\ntrembled at. Might not Jethro wish to take vengeance upon him?\r\n\r\nOne story he did not hear, because no one in Coniston knew it. No one\r\nknew that Cynthia Ware and Jethro Bass had ever loved each other.\r\n\r\nAt last, toward the end of June, it was noised about that the great man\r\nwas coming home for a few days. One beautiful afternoon William Wetherell\r\nstood on the platform of the store, looking off at Coniston, talking to\r\nMoses Hatch--young Moses, who is father of six children now and has\r\nforgotten Cynthia Ware. Old Moses sleeps on the hillside, let us hope in\r\nthe peace of the orthodox and the righteous. A cloud of dust arose above\r\nthe road to the southward, and out of it came a country wagon drawn by a\r\nfat horse, and in the wagon the strangest couple Wetherell had ever seen.\r\nThe little woman who sat retiringly at one end of the seat was all in\r\nbrilliant colors from bonnet to flounce, like a paroquet, red and green\r\npredominating. The man, big in build, large-headed, wore an old-fashioned\r\nblue swallow-tailed coat with brass buttons, a stock, and coonskin hat,\r\nthough it was summer, and the thumping of William Wetherell's heart told\r\nhim that this was Jethro Bass. He nodded briefly at Moses Hatch, who\r\ngreeted him with genial obsequiousness.\r\n\r\n\"Legislatur' through?\" shouted Moses.\r\n\r\nThe great man shook his head and drove on.\r\n\r\n\"Has Jethro Bass ever been a member of the Legislature?\" asked the\r\nstorekeeper, for the sake of something to say.\r\n\r\n\"Never would take any office but Chairman of the Selectmen,\" answered\r\nMoses, who apparently bore no ill will for his father's sake. \"Jethro\r\nkind of fathers the Legislatur', I guess, though I don't take much stock\r\nin politics. Goes down sessions to see that they don't get too gumptious\r\nand kick off the swaddlin' clothes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And--was that his wife?\" Wetherell asked, hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\"Aunt Listy, they call her. Nobody ever knew how he come to marry her.\r\nJethro went up to Wisdom once, in the centre of the state, and come back\r\nwith her. Funny place to bring a wife from--Wisdom! Funnier place to\r\nbring Listy from. He loads her down with them ribbons and gewgaws--all\r\nthe shades of the rainbow! Says he wants her to be the best-dressed woman\r\nin the state. Callate she is,\" added Moses, with conviction. \"Listy's a\r\nfine woman, but all she knows is enough to say, 'Yes, Jethro,' and 'No,\r\nJethro.'--Guess that's all Jethro wants in a wife; but he certainly is\r\ngood to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why has he come back before the Legislature's over?\" said Wetherell.\r\n\r\n\"Cuttin' of his farms. Always comes back hayin' time. That's the way\r\nJethro spends the money he makes in politics, and he hain't no more of a\r\nfarmer than--\" Moses looked at Wetherell.\r\n\r\n\"Than I'm a storekeeper,\" said the latter, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Than I'm a lawyer,\" said Moses, politely.\r\n\r\nThey were interrupted at this moment by the appearance of Jake Wheeler\r\nand Sam Price, who came gaping out of the darkness of the store.\r\n\r\n\"Was that Jethro, Mose?\" demanded Jake. \"Guess we'll go along up and see\r\nif there's any orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose the humblest of God's critturs has their uses,\" Moses remarked\r\ncontemplatively, as he watched the retreating figures of Sam and Jake.\r\n\"Leastwise that's Jethro's philosophy. When you come to know him, you'll\r\nnotice how much those fellers walk like him. Never seed a man who had so\r\nmany imitators. Some of,'em's took to talkie' like him, even to\r\nstutterin'. Bijah Bixby, over to Clovelly, comes pretty nigh it, too.\"\r\n\r\nMoses loaded his sugar and beans into his wagon, and drove off.\r\n\r\nAn air of suppressed excitement seemed to pervade those who came that\r\nafternoon to the store to trade and talk--mostly to talk. After such\r\npurchases as they could remember were made, they lingered on the barrels\r\nand on the stoop, in the hope of seeing Jethro, whose habit; it was,\r\napparently, to come down and dispense such news as he thought fit for\r\ncirculation. That Wetherell shared this excitement, too, he could not\r\ndeny, but for a different cause. At last, when the shadows of the big\r\ntrees had crept across the green, he came, the customers flocking to the\r\nporch to greet him, Wetherell standing curiously behind them in the door.\r\nHeedless of the dust, he strode down the road with the awkward gait that\r\nwas all his own, kicking up his heels behind. And behind him, heels\r\nkicking up likewise, followed Jake and Sam, Jethro apparently oblivious\r\nof their presence. A modest silence was maintained from the stoop, broken\r\nat length by Lem Hallowell, who (men said) was an exact reproduction of\r\nJock, the meeting-house builder. Lem alone was not abashed in the\r\npresence of greatness.\r\n\r\n\"How be you, Jethro?\" he said heartily. \"Air the Legislatur' behavin'\r\nthemselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"B-bout as common,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\nSurely nothing very profound in this remark, but received as though it\r\nwere Solomon's.\r\n\r\nBe prepared for a change in Jethro, after the galloping years. He is now\r\nfifty-seven, but he might be any age. He is still smooth-shaven, his skin\r\nis clear, and his eye is bright, for he lives largely on bread and milk,\r\nand eschews stimulants. But the lines in his face have deepened and his\r\nbig features seem to have grown bigger.\r\n\r\n\"Who be you thinkin' of for next governor, Jethro?\" queries Rias\r\nRichardson, timidly.\r\n\r\n\"They say Alvy Hopkins of Gosport is willin' to pay for it,\" said Chester\r\nPerkins, sarcastically. Chester; we fear, is a born agitator, fated to\r\nremain always in opposition. He is still a Democrat, and Jethro, as is\r\nwell known, has extended the mortgage so as to include Chester's farm.\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't give a Red Brook Seedling for Alvy,\" ejaculated the nasal Mr.\r\nPrice.\r\n\r\n\"D-don't like Red Brook Seedlings, Sam? D-don't like 'em?\" said Jethro.\r\nHe had parted his blue coat tails and seated himself on the stoop, his\r\nlong legs hanging over it.\r\n\r\n\"Never seed a man who had a good word to say for 'em,\" said Mr. Price,\r\nwith less conviction.\r\n\r\n\"Done well on mine,\" said Jethro, \"d-done well. I was satisfied with my\r\nRed Brook Seedlings.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Price's sallow face looked as if he would have contradicted another\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\"How was that, Jethro?\" piped up Jake Wheeler, voicing the general\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nJethro looked off into the blue space beyond the mountain line.\r\n\r\n\"G-got mine when they first come round--seed cost me considerable. Raised\r\nmore than a hundred bushels L-Listy put some of 'em on the table--t-then\r\ngave some to my old hoss Tom. Tom said: 'Hain't I always been a good\r\nbeast, Jethro? Hain't I carried you faithful, summer and winter, for a\r\ngood many years? And now you give me Red Brook Seedlings?'\"\r\n\r\nHere everybody laughed, and stopped abruptly, for Jethro still looked\r\ncontemplative.\r\n\r\n\"Give some of 'em to the hogs. W-wouldn't touch 'em. H-had over a hundred\r\nbushels on hand--n-new variety. W-what's that feller's name down to Ayer,\r\nMassachusetts, deals in all kinds of seeds? Ellett--that's it. Wrote to\r\nEllet, said I had a hundred bushels of Red Brooks to sell, as fine a\r\nlookin' potato as I had in my cellar. Made up my mind to take what he\r\noffered, if it was only five cents. He wrote back a dollar a bushel. I-I\r\nwas always satisfied with my Red Brook Seedlings, Sam. But I never raised\r\nany more--n-never raised any more.\"\r\n\r\nUproarious laughter greeted the end of this story, and continued in fits\r\nas some humorous point recurred to one or the other of the listeners.\r\nWilliam Wetherell perceived that the conversation, for the moment at\r\nleast, was safely away from politics, and in that dubious state where it\r\nwas difficult to reopen. This was perhaps what Jethro wanted. Even Jake\r\nWheeler was tongue-tied, and Jethro appeared to be lost in reflection.\r\n\r\nAt this instant a diversion occurred--a trifling diversion, so it seemed\r\nat the time. Around the corner of the store, her cheeks flushed and her\r\ndark hair flying, ran little Cynthia, her hands, browned already by the\r\nConiston sun, filled with wild strawberries.\r\n\r\n\"See what I've found, Daddy!\" she cried, \"see what I've found!\"\r\n\r\nJethro Bass started, and flung back his head like a man who has heard a\r\nvoice from another world, and then he looked at the child with a kind of\r\nstupefaction. The cry, died on Cynthia's lips, and she stopped, gazing up\r\nat him with wonder in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"F-found strawberries?\" said Jethro, at last.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she answered. She was very grave and serious now, as was her\r\nmanner in dealing with people.\r\n\r\n\"S-show 'em to me,\" said Jethro.\r\n\r\nCynthia went to him, without embarrassment, and put her hand on his knee.\r\nNot once had he taken his eyes from her face. He put out his own hand\r\nwith an awkward, shy movement, picked a strawberry from her fingers, and\r\nthrust it in his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Mm,\" said Jethro, gravely. \"Er--what's your name, little gal--what's\r\nyour name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause.\r\n\r\n\"Er--er--Cynthia?\" he said at length, \"Cynthia?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Er-er, Cynthia--not Cynthy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cynthia,\" she said again.\r\n\r\nHe bent over her and lowered his voice.\r\n\r\n\"M-may I call you Cynthy--Cynthy?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Y-yes,\" answered Cynthia, looking up to her father and then glancing\r\nshyly at Jethro.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were on the mountain, and he seemed to have forgotten her until\r\nshe reached out to him, timidly, another strawberry. He seized her little\r\nhand instead and held it between his own--much to the astonishment of his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\"Whose little gal be you?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Dad's.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's Will Wetherell's daughter,\" said Lem Hallowell. \"He's took on the\r\nstore. Will,\" he added, turning to Wetherell, \"let me make you acquainted\r\nwith Jethro Bass.\"\r\n\r\nJethro rose slowly, and towered above Wetherell on the stoop. There was\r\nan inscrutable look in his black eyes, as of one who sees without being\r\nseen. Did he know who William Wetherell was? If so, he gave no sign, and\r\ntook Wetherell's hand limply.\r\n\r\n\"Will's kinder hipped on book-l'arnin',\" Lemuel continued kindly. \"Come\r\nhere to keep store for his health. Guess you may have heerd, Jethro, that\r\nWill married Cynthy Ware. You call Cynthy to mind, don't ye?\"\r\n\r\nJethro Bass dropped Wetherell's hand, but answered nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nA week passed, and Jethro did not appear in the village, report having it\r\nthat he was cutting his farms on Thousand Acre Hill. When Jethro was\r\nfarming,--so it was said,--he would not stop to talk politics even with\r\nthe President of the United States were that dignitary to lean over his\r\npasture fence and beckon to him. On a sultry Friday morning, when William\r\nWetherell was seated at Jonah Winch's desk in the cool recesses of the\r\nstore slowly and painfully going over certain troublesome accounts which\r\nseemed hopeless, he was thrown into a panic by the sight of one staring\r\nat him from the far side of a counter. History sometimes reverses itself.\r\n\r\n\"What can I do for you--Mr. Bass?\" asked the storekeeper, rather weakly.\r\n\r\n\"Just stepped in--stepped in,\" he answered. \"W-where's Cynthy?\"\r\n\r\n\"She was in the garden--shall I get her?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said, parting his coat tails and seating himself on the counter.\r\n\"Go on figurin', don't mind me.\"\r\n\r\nThe thing was manifestly impossible. Perhaps Wetherell indicated as much\r\nby his answer.\r\n\r\n\"Like storekeepin'?\" Jethro asked presently, perceiving that he did not\r\ncontinue his work.\r\n\r\n\"A man must live, Mr. Bass,\" said Wetherell; \"I had to leave the city for\r\nmy health. I began life keeping store,\" he added, \"but I little thought I\r\nshould end it so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Given to book-l'arnin' then, wahn't you?\" Jethro remarked. He did not\r\nsmile, but stared at the square of light that was the doorway, \"Judson's\r\njewellery store, wahn't it? Judson's?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Judson's,\" Wetherell answered, as soon as he recovered from his\r\namazement. There was no telling from Jethro's manner whether he were\r\nenemy or friend; whether he bore the storekeeper a grudge for having\r\nattained to a happiness that had not been his.\r\n\r\n\"Hain't made a great deal out of life, hev you? N-not a great deal?\"\r\nJethro observed at last.\r\n\r\nWetherell flushed, although Jethro had merely stated a truth which had\r\noften occurred to the storekeeper himself.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't given to all of us to find Rome in brick and leave it in\r\nmarble,\" he replied a little sadly.\r\n\r\nJethro Bass looked at him quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Er-what's that?\" he demanded. \"F-found Rome in brick, left it in marble.\r\nFine thought.\" He ruminated a little. \"Never writ anything--did\r\nyou--never writ anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing worth publishing,\" answered poor William Wetherell.\r\n\r\n\"J-just dreamed'--dreamed and kept store. S--something to have\r\ndreamed--eh--something to have dreamed?\"\r\n\r\nWetherell forgot his uneasiness in the unexpected turn the conversation\r\nhad taken. It seemed very strange to him that he was at last face to face\r\nagain wish the man whom Cynthia Ware had never been able to drive from\r\nher heart. Would, he mention her? Had he continued to love her, in spite\r\nof the woman he had married and adorned? Wetherell asked himself these\r\nquestions before he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"It is more to have accomplished,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"S-something to have dreamed,\" repeated Jethro, rising slowly from the\r\ncounter. He went toward the doorway that led into the garden, and there\r\nhe halted and stood listening.\r\n\r\n\"C-Cynthy!\" he said, \"C-Cynthy!\"\r\n\r\nWetherell dropped his pen at the sound of the name on Jethro's lips. But\r\nit was little Cynthia he was calling little Cynthia in the garden. The\r\nchild came at his voice, and stood looking up at him silently.\r\n\r\n\"H-how old be you, Cynthy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nine,\" answered Cynthia, promptly.\r\n\r\n\"L-like the country, Cynthy--like the country better than the city?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"And country folks? L--like country folks better than city folks?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know many city folks,\" said Cynthia. \"I liked the old doctor\r\nwho sent Daddy up here ever so much, and I liked Mrs. Darwin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mis' Darwin?\"\r\n\r\n\"She kept the house we lived in. She used to give me cookies,\" said\r\nCynthia, \"and bread to feed the pigeons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pigeons? F-folks keep pigeons in the city?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" said Cynthia, laughing at such an idea; \"the pigeons came on\r\nthe roof under our window, and they used to fly right up on the\r\nwindow-sill and feed out of my hand. They kept me company while Daddy,\r\nwas away, working. On Sundays we used to go into the Common and feed\r\nthem, before Daddy got sick. The Common was something like the country,\r\nonly not half as nice.\"\r\n\r\n\"C-couldn't pick flowers in the Common and go barefoot--e--couldn't go\r\nbarefoot, Cynthy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" said Cynthia, laughing again at his sober face.\r\n\r\n\"C-couldn't dig up the Common and plant flowers--could you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you couldn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"P-plant 'em out there?\" asked Jethro.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" cried Cynthia; \"I'll show you.\" She hesitated a moment, and\r\nthen thrust her hand into his. \"Do you want to see?\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess I do,\" said he, energetically, and she led him into the garden,\r\npointing out with pride the rows of sweet peas and pansies, which she had\r\nmade herself. Impelled by a strange curiosity, William Wetherell went to\r\nthe door and watched them. There was a look on the face of Jethro Bass\r\nthat was new to it as he listened to the child talk of the wondrous\r\nthings around them that summer's day,--the flowers and the bees and the\r\nbrook (they must go down and stand on the brink of it), and the songs of\r\nthe vireo and the hermit thrush.\r\n\r\n\"Hain't lonely here, Cynthy--hain't lonely here?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Not in the country,\" said Cynthia. Suddenly she lifted her eyes to his\r\nwith a questioning look. \"Are you lonely, sometimes?\"\r\n\r\nHe did not answer at once.\r\n\r\n\"Not with you, Cynthy--not with you.\"\r\n\r\nBy all of which it will be seen that the acquaintance was progressing.\r\nThey sat down for a while on the old millstone that formed the step, and\r\nthere discussed Cynthia's tastes. She was too old for dolls, Jethro\r\nsupposed. Yes, Cynthia was too old for dolls. She did not say so, but the\r\nonly doll she had ever owned had become insipid when the delight of such\r\na reality as taking care of a helpless father had been thrust upon her.\r\nBooks, suggested Jethro. Books she had known from her earliest infancy:\r\nthey had been piled around that bedroom over the roof. Books and book\r\nlore and the command of the English tongue were William Wetherell's only\r\nlegacies to his daughter, and many an evening that spring she had read\r\nhim to sleep from classic volumes of prose and poetry I hesitate to name,\r\nfor fear you will think her precocious. They went across the green to\r\nCousin Ephraim Prescott's harness shop, where Jethro had tied his horse,\r\nand it was settled that Cynthia liked books.\r\n\r\nOn the morning following this extraordinary conversation, Jethro Bass and\r\nhis wife departed for the state capital. Listy was bedecked in amazing\r\ngreens and yellows, and Jethro drove, looking neither to the right nor\r\nleft, his coat tails hanging down behind the seat, the reins lying slack\r\nacross the plump quarters of his horse--the same fat Tom who, by the way,\r\nhad so indignantly spurned the Iced Brook Seedlings. And Jake Wheeler\r\nwent along to bring back the team from Brampton. To such base uses are\r\npolitical lieutenants sometimes put, although fate would have told you it\r\nwas an honor, and he came back to the store that evening fairly bristling\r\nwith political secrets which he could not be induced to impart.\r\n\r\nOne evening a fortnight later, while the lieutenant was holding forth in\r\ncommendably general terms on the politics of the state to a speechless if\r\nnot wholly admiring audience, a bomb burst in their midst. William\r\nWetherell did not know that it was a periodical bomb, like those flung at\r\nregular intervals from the Union mortars into Vicksburg. These bombs, at\r\nany rate, never failed to cause consternation and fright in Coniston,\r\nalthough they never did any harm. One thing noticeable, they were always\r\nfired in Jethro's absence. And the bombardier was always Chester Perkins,\r\nson of the most unbending and rigorous of tithing-men, but Chester\r\nresembled his father in no particular save that he, too, was a deacon and\r\na pillar of the church. Deacon Ira had been tall and gaunt and sunken and\r\nuncommunicative. Chester was stout, and said to perspire even in winter,\r\napoplectic, irascible, talkative, and still, as has been said, a\r\nDemocrat. He drove up to the store this evening to the not inappropriate\r\nrumble of distant thunder, and he stood up in his wagon in front of the\r\ngathering and shook his fist in Jake Wheeler's face.\r\n\r\n\"This town's tired of puttin' up with a King,\" he cried. \"Yes, King-=I\r\nsaid it, and I don't care who hears me. It's time to stop this one-man\r\nrule. You kin go and tell him I said it, Jake Wheeler, if you've a mind\r\nto. I guess there's plenty who'll do that.\"\r\n\r\nAn uneasy silence followed--the silence which cries treason louder than\r\nany voice. Some shifted uneasily, and spat, and Jake Wheeler thrust his\r\nhands in his pockets and walked away, as much as to say that it was\r\ntreason even to listen to such talk. Lem Hallowell seemed unperturbed.\r\n\r\n\"On the rampage agin, Chet?\" he remarked.\r\n\r\n\"You'd ought to know better, Lem,\" cried the enraged Chester; \"hain't the\r\nhull road by the Four Corners ready to drop into the brook? What be you\r\na-goin' to do about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll show you when I git to it,\" answered Lem, quietly. And, show them\r\nhe did.\r\n\r\n\"Git to it!\" shouted Chester, scornfully, \"I'll git to it. I'll tell you\r\nright now I'm a candidate for the Chairman of the Selectmen, if town\r\nmeetin' is eight months away. An', Sam Price, I'll expect the Democrats\r\nto git into line.\"\r\n\r\nWith this ultimatum Chester drove away as rapidly as he had come.\r\n\r\n\"I want to know!\" said Sam Price, an exclamation peculiarly suited to his\r\nvoice. But nevertheless Sam might be counted on in each of these little\r\nrebellions. He, too, had remained steadfast to Jacksonian principles, and\r\nhe had never forgiven Jethro about a little matter of a state office\r\nwhich he (Sam) had failed to obtain.\r\n\r\nBefore he went to bed Jake Wheeler had written a letter which he sent off\r\nto the state capital by the stage the next morning. In it he indicted no\r\nless than twenty of his fellow-townsmen for treason; and he also thought\r\nit wise to send over to Clovelly for Bijah Bixby, a lieutenant in that\r\nsection, to come and look over the ground and ascertain by his well-known\r\nmethods how far the treason had eaten into the body politic. Such was\r\nJake's ordinary procedure when the bombs were fired, for Mr. Wheeler was\r\nnothing if not cautious.\r\n\r\nThree mornings later, a little after seven o'clock, when the storekeeper\r\nand his small daughter were preparing to go to Brampton upon a very\r\ntroublesome errand, Chester Perkins appeared again. It is always easy to\r\nstir up dissatisfaction among the ne'er-do-wells (Jethro had once done it\r\nhimself), and during the three days which had elapsed since Chester had\r\nflung down the gauntlet there had been more or less of downright treason\r\nheard in the store. William Wetherell, who had perplexities of his own,\r\nhad done his best to keep out of the discussions that had raged on his\r\ncracker boxes and barrels, for his head was a jumble of figures which\r\nwould not come right. And now as he stood there in the freshness of the\r\nearly summer morning, waiting for Lem Hallowell's stage, poor Wetherell's\r\nheart was very heavy.\r\n\r\n\"Will Wetherell,\" said Chester, \"you be a gentleman and a student, hain't\r\nyou? Read history, hain't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have read some,\" said William Wetherell.\r\n\r\n\"I callate that a man of parts,\" said Chester, \"such as you be, will help\r\nus agin corruption and a dictator. I'm a-countin' on you, Will Wetherell.\r\nYou've got the store, and you kin tell the boys the difference between\r\nright and wrong. They'll listen to you, because you're eddicated.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know anything about politics,\" answered Wetherell, with an\r\nappealing glance at the silent group,--group that was always there. Rias\r\nRichardson, who had donned the carpet slippers preparatory to tending\r\nstore for the day, shuffled inside. Deacon Lysander, his father, would\r\nnot have done so.\r\n\r\n\"You know somethin' about history and the Constitootion, don't ye?\"\r\ndemanded Chester, truculently. N'Jethro Bass don't hold your mortgage,\r\ndoes he? Bank in Brampton holds it--hain't that so? You hain't afeard of\r\nJethro like the rest on 'em, be you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what right you have to talk to me that way, Mr. Perkins,\"\r\nsaid Wetherell.\r\n\r\n\"What right? Jethro holds my mortgage--the hull town knows it-and he kin\r\nclose me out to-morrow if he's a mind to--\"\r\n\r\n\"See here, Chester Perkins,\" Lem Hallowell interposed, as he drove up\r\nwith the stage, \"what kind of free principles be you preachin'? You'd\r\nought to know better'n coerce.\"\r\n\r\n\"What be you a-goin' to do about that Four Corners road?\" Chester cried\r\nto the stage driver.\r\n\r\n\"I give 'em till to-morrow night to fix it,\" said Lem. \"Git in, Will.\r\nCynthy's over to the harness shop with Eph. We'll stop as we go 'long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give 'em till to-morrow night!\" Chester shouted after them. \"What you\r\ngoin' to do then?\"\r\n\r\nBut Lem did not answer this inquiry. He stopped at the harness shop,\r\nwhere Ephraim came limping out and lifted Cynthia to the seat beside her\r\nfather, and they joggled off to Brampton. The dew still lay in myriad\r\ndrops on the red herd's-grass, turning it to lavender in the morning sun,\r\nand the heavy scent of the wet ferns hung in the forest. Lem whistled,\r\nand joked with little Cynthia, and gave her the reins to drive, and of\r\nlast they came in sight of Brampton Street, with its terrace-steepled\r\nchurch and line of wagons hitched to the common rail, for it was market\r\nday. Father and daughter walked up and down, hand in hand, under the\r\ngreat trees, and then they went to the bank.\r\n\r\nIt was a brick building on a corner opposite the common, imposing for\r\nBrampton, and very imposing to Wetherell. It seemed like a tomb as he\r\nentered its door, Cynthia clutching his fingers, and never but once in\r\nhis life had he been so near to leaving all hope behind. He waited\r\npatiently by the barred windows until the clerk, who was counting bills,\r\nchose to look up at him.\r\n\r\n\"Want to draw money?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\nThe words seemed charged with irony. William Wetherell told him,\r\nfalteringly, his name and business, and he thought the man looked at him\r\ncompassionately.\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to see Mr. Worthington,\" he said; \"he hasn't gone to the\r\nmills yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dudley Worthington?\" exclaimed Wetherell.\r\n\r\nThe teller smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He's the president of this bank.\"'\r\n\r\nHe opened a door in the partition, and leaving Cynthia dangling her feet\r\nfrom a chair, Wetherell was ushered, not without trepidation, into the\r\ngreat man's office, and found himself at last in the presence of Mr.\r\nIsaac D. Worthington, who used to wander up and down Coniston Water\r\nsearching for a mill site.\r\n\r\nHe sat behind a table covered with green leather, on which papers were\r\nlaid with elaborate neatness, and he wore a double-breasted skirted coat\r\nof black, with braided lapels, a dark purple blanket cravat with a large\r\nred cameo pin. And Mr. Worthington's features harmonized perfectly with\r\nthis costume--those of a successful, ambitious man who followed custom\r\nand convention blindly; clean-shaven, save for reddish chops, blue eyes\r\nof extreme keenness, and thin-upped mouth which had been tightening year\r\nby year as the output of the Worthington Minx increased.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir,\" he said sharply, \"what can I do for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am William Wetherell, the storekeeper at Coniston.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the Wetherell who married Cynthia Ware!\"\r\n\r\nNo, Mr. Worthington did not say that. He did not know that Cynthia Ware\r\nwas married, or alive or dead, and--let it be confessed at once--he did\r\nnot care.\r\n\r\nThis is what he did say:--\r\n\r\n\"Wetherell--Wetherell. Oh, yes, you've come about that note--the mortgage\r\non the store at Coniston.\" He stared at William Wetherell, drummed with\r\nhis fingers on the table, and smiled slightly. \"I am happy to say that\r\nthe Brampton Bank does not own this note any longer. If we did,--merely\r\nas a matter of business, you understand\" (he coughed),--\"we should have\r\nhad to foreclose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't own the note!\" exclaimed Wetherell. \"Who does own it?\"\r\n\r\n\"We sold it a little while ago--since you asked for the extension--to\r\nJethro Bass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jethro Bass!\" Wetherell's feet seemed to give way under him, and he sat\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bass is a little quixotic--that is a charitable way to put\r\nit--quixotic. He does--strange things like this once in awhile.\"\r\n\r\nThe storekeeper found no words to answer, but sat mutely staring at him.\r\nMr. Worthington coughed again.\r\n\r\n\"You appear to be an educated man. Haven't I heard some story of your\r\ngiving up other pursuits in Boston to come up here for your health?\r\nCertainly I place you now. I confess to a little interest in literature\r\nmyself--in libraries.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of his stupefaction at the news he had just received, Wetherell\r\nthought of Mr. Worthington's beaver hat, and of that gentleman's first\r\ninterest in libraries, for Cynthia had told the story to her husband.\r\n\r\n\"It is perhaps an open secret,\" continued Mr. Worthington, \"that in the\r\nnear future I intend to establish a free library in Brampton. I feel it\r\nmy duty to do all I can for the town where I have made my success, and\r\nthere is nothing which induces more to the popular welfare than a good\r\nlibrary.\" Whereupon he shot at Wetherell another of his keen looks. \"I do\r\nnot talk this way ordinarily to my customers, Mr. Wetherell,\" he began;\r\n\"but you interest me, and I am going to tell you something in confidence.\r\nI am sure it will not be betrayed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" said the bewildered storekeeper, who was in no condition to\r\nlisten to confidences.\r\n\r\nHe went quietly to the door, opened it, looked out, and closed it softly.\r\nThen he looked out of the window.\r\n\r\n\"Have a care of this man Bass,\" he said, in a lower voice. \"He began many\r\nyears ago by debauching the liberties of that little town of Coniston,\r\nand since then he has gradually debauched the whole state, judges and\r\nall. If I have a case to try\" (he spoke now with more intensity and\r\nbitterness), \"concerning my mills, or my bank, before I get through I\r\nfind that rascal mixed up in it somewhere, and unless I arrange matters\r\nwith him, I--\"\r\n\r\nHe paused abruptly, his eyes going out of the window, pointing with a\r\nlong finger at a grizzled man crossing the street with a yellow and red\r\nhorse blanket thrown over his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"That man, Judge Baker, holding court in this town now, Bass owns body\r\nand soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the horse blanket?\" Wetherell queried, irresistibly.\r\n\r\nDudley Worthington did not smile.\r\n\r\n\"Take my advice, Mr. Wetherell, and pay off that note somehow.\" An odor\r\nof the stable pervaded the room, and a great unkempt grizzled head and\r\nshoulders, horse blanket and all, were stuck into it.\r\n\r\n\"Mornin', Dudley,\" said the head, \"busy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come right in, Judge,\" answered Mr. Worthington. \"Never too busy to see\r\nyou.\" The head disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Take my advice, Mr. Wetherell.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then the storekeeper went into the bank.\r\n\r\nFor some moments he stood dazed by what he had heard, the query ringing\r\nin his head: Why had Jethro Bass bought that note? Did he think that the\r\nstorekeeper at Coniston would be of use to him, politically? The words\r\nChester Perkins had spoken that morning came back to Wetherell as he\r\nstood in the door. And how was he to meet Jethro Bass again with no money\r\nto pay even the interest on the note? Then suddenly he missed Cynthia,\r\nhurried out, and spied her under the trees on the common so deep in\r\nconversation with a boy that she did not perceive him until he spoke to\r\nher. The boy looked up, smiling frankly at something Cynthia had said to\r\nhim. He had honest, humorous eyes, and a browned, freckled face, and was,\r\nperhaps, two years older than Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" said Wetherell.\r\n\r\nCynthia's face was flushed, and she was plainly vexed about something.\r\n\r\n\"I gave her a whistle,\" said the boy, with a little laugh of vexation,\r\n\"and now she says she won't take it because I owned up I made it for\r\nanother girl.\"\r\n\r\nCynthia held it out to him, not deigning to appeal her ease.\r\n\r\n\"You must take it back,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"But I want you to have it,\" said the boy.\r\n\r\n\"It wouldn't be right for me to take it when you made it for somebody\r\nelse.\"\r\n\r\nAfter all, people with consciences are born, not made. But this was a\r\nfiner distinction that the boy had ever met with in his experience.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know you when I made the whistle,\" he objected, puzzled and\r\ndowncast.\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't make any difference.\"\r\n\r\n\"I like you better than the other girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have no right to,\" retorted the casuist; \"you've known her longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't make any difference,\" said the boy; \"there are lots of\r\npeople I don't like I have always known. This girl doesn't live in\r\nBrampton, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where does she live?\" demanded Cynthia,--which was a step backward.\r\n\r\n\"At the state capital. Her name's Janet Duncan. There, do you believe me\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell had heard of Janet Duncan's father, Alexander Duncan,\r\nwho had the reputation of being the richest man in the state. And he\r\nbegan to wonder who the boy could be.\r\n\r\n\"I believe you,\" said Cynthia; \"but as long as you made it for her, it's\r\nhers. Will you take it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said he, determinedly.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" answered Cynthia. She laid down the whistle beside him on\r\nthe rail, and went off a little distance and seated herself on a bench.\r\nThe boy laughed.\r\n\r\n\"I like that girl,\" he remarked; \"the rest of 'em take everything I give\r\n'em, and ask for more. She's prettier'n any of 'em, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your name?\" Wetherell asked him, curiously, forgetting his own\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\n\"Bob Worthington.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you the son of Dudley Worthington\"\r\n\r\n\"Everybody asks me that,\" he said; \"I'm tired of it. When I grow up,\r\nthey'll have to stop it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you should be proud of your father.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am proud of him, everybody's proud of him, Brampton's proud of\r\nhim--he's proud of himself. That's enough, ain't it?\" He eyed Wetherell\r\nsomewhat defiantly, then his glance wandered to Cynthia, and he walked\r\nover to her. He threw himself down on the grass in front of her, and lay\r\nlooking up at her solemnly. For a while she continued to stare inflexibly\r\nat the line of market wagons, and then she burst into a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Thought you wouldn't hold out forever,\" he remarked.\r\n\r\n\"It's because you're so foolish,\" said Cynthia, \"that's why I laughed.\"\r\nThen she grew sober again and held out her hand to him. \"Good-by.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"I must go back to my father. I--I think he doesn't feel very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Next time I'll make a whistle for you,\" he called after her.\r\n\r\n\"And give it to somebody else,\" said Cynthia.\r\n\r\nShe had hold of her father's hand by that, but he caught up with her,\r\nvery red in the face.\r\n\r\n\"You know that isn't true,\" he cried angrily, and taking his way across\r\nBrampton Street, turned, and stood staring after them until they were out\r\nof sight.\r\n\r\n\"Do you like him, Daddy?\" asked Cynthia.\r\n\r\nWilliam Wetherell did not answer. He had other things to think about.\r\n\r\n\"Daddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does your trouble feel any better?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some, Cynthia. But you mustn't think about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Daddy, why don't you ask Uncle Jethro to help you?\"\r\n\r\nAt the name Wetherell started as if he had had a shock.\r\n\r\n\"What put him into your head, Cynthia?\" he asked sharply. \"Why do you\r\ncall him 'Uncle Jethro'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he asked me to. Because he likes me, and I like him.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole thing was a riddle he could not solve--one that was best left\r\nalone. They had agreed to walk back the ten miles to Coniston, to save\r\nthe money that dinner at the hotel would cost. And so they started,\r\nCynthia flitting hither and thither along the roadside, picking the\r\nstately purple iris flowers in the marshy places, while Wetherell\r\npondered.",
