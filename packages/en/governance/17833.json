Printed and\r\npublished by special command. London, Printed by Henry Hills, Printer to\r\nthe Army, dwelling in Aldersgate Street next door to the Peacock. 1659\".\r\nThree days afterwards, on October 27, John Evelyn had finished writing an\r\nanswer, which was published a week later, on November 4, under the title:\r\n\"An Apologie for the Royal Party ... With a Touch At the pretended Plea\r\nfor the Army. Anno Dom. MDCLIX\". No author's name, printer or place was\r\ngiven. Evelyn afterwards made the note in his Diary under the date\r\nNovember 7, 1659, that is, three days after the actual publication: \"Was\r\npublish'd my bold Apologie for the King in His time of danger, when it was\r\ncapital to speak or write in favour of him. It was twice printed, so\r\nuniversaly it took.\"[1] Evelyn was by conviction an ardent royalist, but\r\nby temperament he was peaceable, and the publication of this pamphlet was\r\na courageous act on his part, involving considerable risks.\r\n\r\nThe _Apologie for the Royal Party_ contains an eloquent and outspoken\r\nattack upon the parliamentary party, the depth of the author's feelings\r\nmaking his style of writing more effective than it usually was.\r\n\r\nEvents were at this date nearing their climax, and Evelyn, soon after the\r\npublication of his pamphlet, made persistent attempts to induce Colonel\r\nHenry Morley, then Lieutenant of the Tower of London, to declare for the\r\nKing. In the edition of Baker's _Chronicle of the Kings of England_,\r\nedited by Edward Phillips, 1665, is given the following account of the\r\nnegotiations (p. 736): \"Mr. Evelyn gave him [Col. Morley] some visits to\r\nattemper his affection by degrees to a confidence in him, & then by\r\nconsequence to ingage him in his designes; and to induce him the more\r\npowerfully thereunto, he put into his hands an excellent and unanswerable\r\nhardy treatise by him written and severall times reprinted, intituled _An\r\nApology for the Royall Party_, which he backed with so good Argument and\r\ndextrous Addresses in the prosecution of them, that, after some private\r\ndiscourse, the Colonel was so well inclin'd, as to recommend to him the\r\nprocurement of his Majestie's Grace for him, his Brother-in-law Mr. Fagg,\r\nand one or two more of his Relations\". Phillips added an account of a\r\nletter written by Evelyn to Colonel Morley, and gave him great credit for\r\nthe influence which he exerted, though Evelyn endorsed a draft of the\r\nnarrative with a statement saying there \"was too much said concerning me\".\r\nNevertheless part of the narrative was confirmed by Evelyn when he wrote\r\non the title-page of the copy of the pamphlet here reproduced: \"Delivered\r\nto Coll. Morley a few daies after his contest w^th Lambert in the palace\r\nyard by J. Evelyn\". The \"contest\" with General Lambert took place on\r\nOctober 12 or 13 when Morley, pistol in hand, refused to allow him at the\r\nhead of his troops to pass through the Palace Yard.\r\n\r\nEvelyn also wrote on the title-page of this copy of his pamphlet \"three\r\ntymes printed\". In fact there were four printings, all described in the\r\nwriter's _John Evelyn, a Study in Bibliophily & a Bibliography of his\r\nWritings_, New York, The Grolier Club, 1937, the one here reproduced being\r\nthe fourth and final form. Nevertheless all four issues are now extremely\r\nscarce, the first printing being known in three copies (one in the United\r\nStates), the second in seven (two in the United States), the third in one,\r\nand the fourth in one. This apparently unique relic of Evelyn's bold\r\ngesture on behalf of his King is in the writer's possession and is still\r\nas issued, edges untrimmed and with its eight leaves stitched in a\r\ncontemporary paper wrapper. It has been reprinted only in Evelyn's\r\n_Miscellaneous Writings_, 1825, pp. 169-192.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Charles II actually returned to England in 1660 Evelyn's feelings\r\nwere deeply stirred. He had played some part in the restoration of the\r\nmonarchy, and, with his literary instinct, naturally felt impelled to be\r\namong those who wished to present the King with an address on the day of\r\nhis Coronation. This took place on April 23, 1661, and on the following\r\nday Evelyn recorded in his Diary: \"I presented his Ma^tie with his\r\nPanegyric in the Private Chamber, which he was pleas'd to accept most\r\ngraciously: I gave copies to the Lord Chancellor and most of the noblemen\r\nwho came to me for it.\"[2] Evelyn's _Panegyric_ was thus distributed\r\nprivately and no doubt in small number, so that it is today extremely\r\nuncommon, being known only in five copies, not more than one of which is\r\nin the United States of America. Evelyn possessed a copy in 1687 according\r\nto his library catalogue compiled in that year, and a copy (not\r\nnecessarily the same one) is now among his books in the library of Christ\r\nChurch, Oxford, but it seems to have been unknown in 1825 and was not\r\nincluded in the _Miscellaneous Writings_. William Upcott, the editor, in\r\nfact erroneously identified the _Panegyric_ with the anonymous piece in\r\nfolio: \"A Poem upon his Majesties Coronation ... Being S^t Georges day ...\r\nLondon, Printed for Gabriel Bedel and Thomas Collins ... 1661\". This\r\nmistake was not put right until a copy of the true _Panegyric_ with\r\nEvelyn's name on the title-page was acquired for the British Museum in\r\n1927 from the Britwell Court Library. The copy here reproduced is in the\r\nwriter's collection, and has a few corrections in Evelyn's hand: (a)\r\n_XXXIII. of April_, on title-page corrected to _XXIII_; (b) p.6. l.18\r\n_Family_ altered to _Firmament_; (c) p.8. l.16 from bottom _suffer_\r\naltered to _surfeit_.\r\n\r\nWhen the _Panegyric_ was identified it was realised that it was not a\r\npoem, but an eloquent and extravagant composition in prose, in which\r\nEvelyn invested Charles II with every conceivable virtue and all wisdom.\r\nThis was no doubt written with sincere enthusiasm, though Evelyn suffered\r\na profound disillusionment in later years; and if he ever read his\r\neffusion again it must have caused him some distress. The _Panegyric_ is\r\nnow reprinted for the first time.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey Keynes\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Evelyn's _Diary_, ed. Wheatley, vol. II, p. 108.\r\n\r\n[2] Evelyn's _Diary_, ed.

For\r\nif as the Apostle affirms, _For a good man, some would even dare to dy_,\r\nwhy should my Charity be prejudged, if hoping to convert you from the\r\nerrour of your way, I despair not of rendring you the Person for whose\r\npreservation there will be nothing too dear for me to expose?\r\n\r\nI might with reason beleeve that the first election of the Party wherein\r\nyou stood engaged, proceeded from inexperience and the mistake of your\r\nzeal; not to say from your compliance to the passions of others; because I\r\nboth knew your education, and how obsequious you have alwayes shewed your\r\nself to those who had then the direction of you: But, when after the\r\nexample of their conversion, upon discovery of the Impostures which\r\nperverted them; and the signal indignation of God, upon the several\r\nperiods which your eyes have lately beheld, of the bloudiest Tyrannies,\r\nand most prodigious oppressors that ever any age of the world produc'd, I\r\nsee you still persist in your course, and that you have turn'd about with\r\nevery revolution which has hapned: when I consider, what contradictions\r\nyou have swallowed, how deeply you have ingaged, how servilely you have\r\nflatter'd, and the base and mean submissions by which you have\r\ndishonour'd your self, and stained your noble Family; not to mention the\r\nleast refinement of your religion or morality (besides that you have still\r\npreserved a civility for me, who am ready to acknowledge it, and never\r\nmerited other from you) I say, when I seriously reflect upon all this; I\r\ncannot but suspect the integrity of your procedure, deplore the sadness of\r\nyour condition, and resolve to attempt the discovery of it to you; by all\r\nthe instances, which an affection perfectly touch't with a zeal for your\r\neternall interest can produce. And who can tell, but it may please\r\nAlmighty God, to affect _you_ yet by a weak instrument, who have resisted\r\nso many powerfull indications of his displeasure at your proceedings, by\r\nthe event of things?\r\n\r\nFor, since you are apt to recriminate, and after you have boasted of the\r\nprosperity or your cause, and the thriving of your Wickedness (an Argument\r\nfarr better becoming a _Mahumetan_ then a _Christian_) let us state the\r\nmatter a little, and compare particulars together; let us go back to the\r\nsource, and search the very principles; and then see, if ever any cause\r\nhad like success indeed; and whether it be a just reproach to your\r\nEnemies, that the judgments of God have begun with them, whilst you know\r\nnot yet, where they may determine.\r\n\r\nFirst then, be pleased to look North-wards upon your Brethren the Scots,\r\nwho (being first instigated by that crafty _Cardinal_ [SN: Richlieu] to\r\ndisturb the groth of the incomparable _Church of England_, and so\r\nconsequently the tranquility of a Nation, whose expedition at the Isle of\r\n_Ree_, gave terrour to the French) made Reformation their pretence, to\r\ngratifie their own avarice, introduce themselves, and a more then\r\n_Babylonish_ Tyranny, imposing upon the Church and state, beyond all\r\nimpudence or example. _I_ say, look upon what they have gotten, by\r\ndeceiving their Brethren, selling their King, betraying his Son, and by\r\nall their perfidie; but a slavery more then _Egyptian_, and an infamy as\r\nunparallel'd, as their treason and ingratitude.\r\n\r\nLook neerer home on those whom they had ingaged amongst us here, & tell me\r\nif there be a Person of them left, that can shew me his prize, unless it\r\nbe that of his Sacriledg, which he, or his Nephews must certainly vomite\r\nup again: What is become of this ignorant and furious zeal, this pretence\r\nof an universall perfection in the Religious and the Secular, after all\r\nthat Blood and Treasure, Rapine and Injustice, which has been exhausted,\r\nand perpetrated by these Sons of Thunder? Where is the King, whom they\r\nswear to make so glorious, but meant it in his _Martyrdome_? Where is the\r\nClassis, and the Assembly, the Lay-elder; all that geare of Scottish\r\ndiscipline, and the fine new Trinkets of Reformation? Were not all these\r\ntaken out of their hand, while now they were in the height of their pride\r\nand triumph? And their dull Generall made to serve the execution of their\r\nSovereign, and then to be turn'd off himself, as a property no more of use\r\nto their designes? Their riches and their strength in which they trusted,\r\nand the Parliament which they even idoliz'd, in sum, the prey they had\r\ncontended for at the expence of so much sin and damnation, seizd upon by\r\nthose very instruments, which they had rais'd to serve their insatiable\r\navarice, and prodigious disloyalty. For so it pleased God to chastise\r\ntheir implacable persecution of an excellent Prince, with a slavery under\r\nsuch a _Tyrant_, as not being contented to butcher even some upon the\r\nScaffold, sold divers of them for slaves, and others he exild into cruell\r\nbanishment, without pretence of Law, or the least commiseration; that\r\nthose who before had no mercy on others, might find none themselves; till\r\nupon some hope of their repentance, and future moderation, it pleased God\r\nto put his hook into the nostrills of that proud _Leviathan_, and send him\r\nto his place, after he had thus mortified the fury of the Presbyterians.\r\nFor unlesse God himself should utter his voice from Heaven, _yea, and that\r\na mighty voice_, can there any thing in the world be more evident, then\r\nhis indignation at those wretches and barefac't Impostors, who, one after\r\nanother, usurped upon us, taking them off at the very point of aspiring,\r\nand præcipitating the glory and ambition of these men, before those that\r\nwere, but now, their adorers, and that had prostituted their consciences\r\nto serve their lusts? To call him the _Moses_, the _Man of God_, the\r\n_Joshua_, the _Saviour_ of _Israel_; and after all this, to treat the\r\n_Thing_ his son with addresses no lesse then blasphemous, whose Father (as\r\nthemselves confess to be the most infamous Hypocrite and profligate\r\nAtheist of all the Usurpers that ever any age produc'd) had made them his\r\nVassalls, and would have intaild them so to his posterity for ever?\r\n\r\nBut behold the scean is again changed, not by the Royall party, the Common\r\nEnemy, or a forreign power; but by the despicable _Rumpe_ of a Parliament,\r\nwhich that _Mountebanke_ had formerly serv'd himself of, and had rais'd\r\nhim to that pitch, and investiture: But see withall, how soon these\r\ntriflers and puppets of policy are blown away, with all their pack of\r\nmodells and childish _Chimæras_, nothing remaining of them but their\r\nCoffine, guarded by the Souldiers at Westminster; but which is yet lesse\r\nempty then the heads of those Polititians, which so lately seemed to fill\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, I despise to blot paper with a recitall of those wretched\r\n_Interludes, Farces and Fantasms_, which appear'd in the severall\r\nintervalls; because they were nothing but the effects of an extream\r\ngyddiness, and unparallel'd levity. Yet these are those various\r\ndespensations and providences in your journey to that _holy land_ of\r\npurchases and profits, to which you have from time to time appeal'd for\r\nthe justification of your proceedings, whilst they were, indeed, no other\r\nthen the manifest judgments of God upon your rebellion and your ambition:\r\nI say nothing of your hypocriticall fasts, and pretended humiliations,\r\nprevious to the succeeding plots, and supposititious Revelations, that\r\n_the godly might fall into the hands of your Captains_, because they were\r\nbugbears, and became ridiculous even to the common people.\r\n\r\nAnd now _Sr._ if you please, let us begin to set down the product and\r\nsurvey the successe of your party and after all these faces and vertigo's\r\ntell me ingenuously, if the single chastisment which is fallen upon one\r\nafflicted man, and his loyall subjects, distressed by the common event of\r\nwar, want of treasure, the seizure of his Fleet, forcing him from his\r\nCity, and all the disadvantages that a perfidious people could imagine;\r\nbut in fine the crowning him with a glorious _Martyrdome_ for the Church\r\nof God and the liberty of his people (for which his blood doth yet cry\r\naloud for vengeance) be comparable to the confusion which you (that have\r\nbeen the conquerours) have suffered, and the slavery which you are like to\r\nleave to the posterities which will be born but to curse you, and to groan\r\nunder the pressures which you bequeath to your own flesh & blood? For to\r\nwhat a condition you have already reduced this once flourishing kingdom,\r\nsince all has been your own, let the intolerable oppressions, taxes,\r\nExcises, sequestrations confiscations, plunders, customes, decimations,\r\nnot to mention the plate, even to very thimbles and the bodkins (for even\r\nto these did your avarice descend) and other booties, speak. All this\r\ndissipated and squandred away, to gratifie a few covetous and ambitious\r\nwretches, whose appetites are as deep as hell, and as insatiable as the\r\ngrave; as if (as the Wise-man speaks) _our time here were but a market for\r\ngain_.\r\n\r\nLook then into the Churches, and manners of the people, even amongst your\r\nown _Saints_, and tell me, if since _Simon Magus_ was upon the earth,\r\nthere were ever heard of so many _Schismes_, and _Heresies_, of _Jewes_\r\nand _Socinians_, _Quakers_, _Fifth-monarchy-men_, _Arians_, _Anabaptists_,\r\n_Independents_, and a thousand severall forts of _Blasphemies_ and\r\nprofessed _Atheists_, all of them spawned under your government; and then\r\ntell me what a Reformation of Religion you have effected?\r\n\r\nWas there ever in the whole Earth (not to mention Christendom alone) a\r\nperjury so prodigious, and yet so avowed as that by which you have taken\r\naway the estate of my L. _Craven_, at which the very _Infidels_ would\r\nblush, a _Turke_ or _Sythian_ stand amaz'd?\r\n\r\nUnder the Sun was it never heard, that a man should be condemned for\r\ntransgressing no law, but that which was made after the fact, and\r\nabrogated after execution; that the Posterities to come might not be\r\nwitnesses of your horrid injustice: Yet thus you proceeded against my _L.\r\nStafford_. How many are those gallant persons whom after articles of war,\r\nyou have butchered in cold-blood, violating your promises against the\r\nLawes of all Nations, civill or barbarous; and yet thus you dealt in the\r\ncase of my L. _Capel_, Sr. _J. Stawel_ and others.\r\n\r\nIs not the whole nation become sullen and proud, ignorant and suspicious,\r\nincharitable, curst, and in fine, the most depraved and perfidious under\r\nheaven? And whence does all this proceed, but from the effects of your own\r\nexamples, and the impunity of evill doers?\r\n\r\nI need not tell you how long Justice has been sold by the _Committees_,\r\nand the Chair-men, the Sequestrators and Simoniacall Tryers, not to\r\nmention the late Courtiers, and a swarm of _Publicans_ who _have eaten up\r\nthe People as if they would eat bread_.\r\n\r\nWill you come now to the particular mis-fortunes, and the evident hand of\r\nGod upon you for these actions (for he has not altogether left us without\r\nsome expresse witnesses of his displeasure at your doings,) Behold then\r\nyour _Essex_ and your _Warwick_, your _Ferfaix_, and your _Waller_, (whom\r\nonce your Books stiled the _Lord of Hosts_) Cashiered, Imprisoned,\r\nSuspected and Disgraced after all their Services. _Hotham_, and his _Son_\r\ncame to the block; _Stapleton_ had the buriall of an Asse, and was thrown\r\ninto a Town Ditch; _Brookes_ and _Hamden_ signally slain in the very act\r\nof Rebellion and Sacriledge; your atheisticall _Dorislaw_, _Ascam_ and the\r\nSodomiticall _Ariba_, whom though they escaped the hand of Justice, yet\r\n_Vengeance_ would not suffer to live: What became of _Rainsborough_?\r\n_Ireton_ perished of the Plague, and _Hoyle_ hanged himself; _Staplie_\r\n'tis said, died mad, and _Cromwell_ in a fit of raging; and if there were\r\nany others worthy the taking notice of, I should give you a list of their\r\nnames and of their destinies; but it was not known whence they came which\r\nsucceeded them; nor had they left any memory behind them, but for their\r\nsignal wickednesses, as he that set on fire the _Ephesian Temple_ to be\r\nrecorded a Villain to posterity. Whereas those noble souls whom your\r\ninhumanity, (not your vertue) betrayed, gave proof of their extraction,\r\nInnocency, Religion and Constancy under all their Tryals and Tormentors;\r\nand those that dyed by the sword, fell in the bed of honour, and did\r\nworthily for their Country; their _Loyalty_ and their _Religion_ will be\r\nrenowned in the History of Ages, and pretious to their memory, when your\r\nnames will rot with your Carkasses, and your remembrance be as dung upon\r\nthe face of the Earth. For there is already no place of _Europe_ where\r\nyour infamy is not spread; whilst your persecuted brethren rejoyce in\r\ntheir sufferings, can abound, and can want, blush not at their actions,\r\nnor are ashamed at their addresses; because they have suffered for that\r\nwhich their Faith and their Birth, their Lawes and their Liberties have\r\ncelebrated with the most glorious Inscriptions, and Everlasting Elogies.\r\n\r\nAnd if fresher instances of all these particulars be required, cast your\r\neye a little upon the _Armies pretended Plea_, which came lately a birding\r\nto beat the way before them, charm the ears of the Vulgar, and captivate\r\nthe people; That after all its _pseudo-politicks_ and irreligious\r\nprinciples, is at last constrained to acknowledg _your open and prodigious\r\nviolations, strange and illegal Actions, (as in termes it confesses) of\r\ntaking up Armes, Raising and Forming Armies against the King, fighting\r\nagainst his Person, Imprisoning, Impeaching, Arraigning, Trying and\r\nExecuting Him: Banishing his Children, abolishing Bishops, Deans and\r\nChapters; taking away Kingly Government, and the House of Lords, breaking\r\nthe Crowns, selling the Jewells, Plate, Goods, Houses and Lands belonging\r\nunto the Kings of this Nation, erecting extraordinary High Courts of\r\nJustice, and therein Impeaching, Arraigning, condemning, and Executing\r\nmany pretended notorious Enemies, to the publick Peace; when the Lawes in\r\nbeing, and the Ordinary Courts of Justice could not reach them: By strange\r\nand unknown practises in this Nation, and not at all Justifiable by any\r\nknown Lawes and Statutes_, But by certain diabolical principles of late\r\ndistilled into some person of the Army, and which he would entitle to the\r\nwhole, who (abating some of their Commanders, that have sucked the sweet\r\nof this Doctrine) had them never so much as entred into their thoughts,\r\nnor could they be so depraved, though they were Masters only of the Light\r\nof Nature to direct them. For Common sence will tell them, that whoever\r\nare our lawful Superiours, and invested with the supreame Authority,\r\neither by their own vertue, or the peoples due Election, have then a just\r\nright to challenge submission to their precepts, and that we acquiesce in\r\ntheir determinations; since there is in nature no other expedient to\r\npreserve us from everlasting confusion: But it is the height of all\r\nimpertinency to conceive, that those which are a part of themselves, and\r\ncan in so great a Body, have no other interests, should (without the\r\nmanifest hand of God were in it to infatuate all your proceedings) fall\r\ninto such exorbitant contradiction to their own good, as a child of four\r\nyears old would not be guilty of; and as this Pamphleter wildly suggests\r\nin pp. 6. 11. 27, &c. did they steer their course by the known laws of the\r\nLand, and as obedient Subjects should do, who without the King and his\r\nPeers, are but the Carkass of a Parliament, as destitute of the Soul which\r\nshould inform and give it being. And if so small a handful of men as\r\nappeared in the Palace-Yard, without consent of a quarter of the English\r\nArmy, much lesse the tenthousand'th part of the Free-people that are not\r\nclad in red, shall disturb and alter your Government when it thinks fit to\r\nset aside a few imperious Officers, who plainly seek themselves, and\r\nderive their Commissions from superiours to whom they swear obedience; how\r\ncan you ever hope, or live to see any government established in these\r\nmiserably abused Nations? Behold then with how weak a party you are\r\nvanquish'd, even by those very instruments you had so long flatter'd with\r\nthe title of the _Free-people_; imputing all the direful effects of your\r\ndepraved principles to their desires, when as I dare report my self to the\r\ningenuity of the very Souldiers themselves, if they, who have effected all\r\nthese changes by your wretched instigations, and blind pretences, imagine\r\nthemselves the People of this Nation, but are{1} a very small portion of\r\nthem, compared to the whole, and who are maintained by them to recover,\r\nand protect the Civill Government, according to the Good old Lawes of the\r\nLand; not such as they themselves shall invent from Day to Day, or as the\r\ninterests of some few persons may engage them.\r\n\r\nBut if the essential end of Rulers be the Common peace, and their Lawes\r\nobliging as they become relative: Restore us then to those under which we\r\nlived with so much sweetness and tranquility, as no age in the World, no\r\nGovernment under Heaven could ever pretend the like. And if the People (as\r\nyou declare) are to be the Judges of it, summon them together in a Free\r\nParliament, according to its legal Constitution; or make a universal\r\n_Balott_, and then let it appear, if _Collonel Lambert_ and half a dozen\r\nOfficers, with all their seduced Partizans, make so much as a single\r\n_Cypher_ to the _Summe Total_. And this shall be enough to answer those\r\ndevious Principles set down in the porch of that specious Edifice; which\r\nbeing erected upon the Sand, will (like the rest that has been _daubed\r\nwith untempered mortar_) sink also at the next high wind that blowes upon\r\nit. But I am glad it is at last avowed, upon what pretexts that late\r\npretended Parliament have pleaded on the behalf of themselves and party,\r\ntheir discharge from all the former Protestations, Engagements, solemn\r\nVowes, Covenants, with hands (as you say) lift up to the most high God, as\r\nalso their Oaths and Allegiance, &c. because I shall not in this discourse\r\nbe charged with slandering of them, and that the whole World may detest\r\nthe Actions of such perfidious Infidels, with whom nothing sacred has\r\nremain'd inviolable.\r\n\r\nBut there is yet a piece of Artifice behind, of no less consequence then\r\nthe former, and that is, a seeking to perswade the present Army, that\r\n_They_ were the men, who first engaged thus solemnly to destroy the\r\nGovernment under which they were born, and reduce it to this miserable\r\ncondition: whereas it is well known by such as converse daily with them,\r\nthat there is hardly one of ten amongst them, who was then in Armes; and\r\nthat it was the Zelots under _Essex_, and the succeeding Generals, who\r\nwere the persons whose perfidiousness{2} he makes so much use of, and that\r\nthe present Army consists of a far more ingenuous spirit, and might in one\r\nmoment vindicate this aspersion, make their conditions with all advantage,\r\nand these Nations the most happy People upon the Earth, as it cannot be\r\ndespaired but they will one day do, when by the goodness of Almighty God,\r\nthey shall perfectly discern through the mist which you have cast upon\r\ntheir eyes, lest they should discover the Imposture of these _Egyptian_\r\nSorcerers.\r\n\r\nAnd now, _Sir_, if after all this injustice, and impiety on your parts,\r\nyou have prosecuted that with the extreamest madness, which you esteemed\r\ncriminal in your enemies, _viz._ _To arrogate the supream power in a\r\nsingle person;{3} condemn men without Law; execute, and proscribe them\r\nwith as little: Imprest for your Service, violate your Parliaments,\r\ndispense with your solemn Oaths_; in summe, _to mingle Earth and Heaven by\r\nyour arbitrary proceedings_: All which, not only your printed books, this\r\npretended _plea_; but your Actions have abundantly declared; have you not\r\njustified the Royal party, and pronounced them the only honest men which\r\nhave appeared upon the stage, in Characters as plain, that he which runs\r\nmay read, whilst yet you persecute them to the death? _Therefore, thou\r\nart inexcusable, O Man, that _perpetratest_ these things; For wherein thou\r\njudgest another, thou condemnest thy self, seeing thou that judgest doest\r\nthe same things. But thinkest thou this O Man, that thus judgest them\r\nwhich do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the\r\n_vengeance_ of God? I tell ye nay, but except ye repent, ye shall all\r\nlikewise perish._\r\n\r\nTruly, _Sir_, when I compare these things together, and compare them I do\r\nvery often, consider the purchases which you have made, and the damnation\r\nyou have certainly adventured; the despite you have done to the name of\r\nChrist, the Laws of Common humanity which you have violated, the malice\r\nand the folly of your proceedings; in fine, the confusion which you have\r\nbrought upon the Church, the State, and your selves; I adore the just and\r\nrighteous judgment of God; and (howsoever you may possibly emerge, and\r\nrecover the present rout) had rather be a sufferer among those whom you\r\nhave thus afflicted, and thus censure, then to enjoy the pleasures of your\r\nsins for that season you are likely to possess them: For if an Angel from\r\nHeaven should tell me you had done your duties, I would no more believe\r\nhim, then if he should preach another Gospel, then that which has been\r\ndelivered to us; because you have blasphemed that holy profession, and\r\ndone violence to that Gracious Spirit, by whose sacred dictates you are\r\ntaught to live in obedience to your Superiours, and in Charity to one\r\nanother; covering yet all this _Hydra_ of Impostures with a mask Of Piety\r\nand Reformation, whilst you breath nothing but oppression, and lye in wait\r\nto deceive. But _O God! how long shall the Adversary do this dishonour,\r\nhow long shall the Enemy blaspheme thy name, for ever? They gather them\r\ntogether against the soul of the Righteous, and condemn the innocent\r\nblood. Lo these are the ungodly, these prosper in the World, and these\r\nhave riches in possession: And I said, then have I cleansed my heart in\r\nvain, and washed my hands in innocency. Yea, and I had almost said as\r\nthey; but lo, then I should have condemned the generation of thy Children.\r\nThen thought I to understand this, but it was too hard for me, untill I\r\nwent into the Sanctuary of God; then understood I the end of these Men.\r\nNamely, how thou dost set them in slippery places, castest them down and\r\ndestroyest them._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _O how suddenly do they consume, perish, and come to a fearfull end!_\r\n\r\nWe have seen it, indeed _Sir_, we have seen it, and we cannot but\r\nacknowledge it the very finger of God, _mirabile in oculis nostris_; and\r\nis that, truly, which even constrains me out of Charity to your Soul, as\r\nwell as out of a deep sense of your Honour, and the Friendship which I\r\notherwise bear you, to beseech you to re-enter into your self, to abandon\r\nthose false Principles, to withdraw your self from these Seducers, to\r\nrepent of what you have done, _and save your self from this untoward\r\nGeneration_: There is yet a door of Repentance open, do not provoke the\r\nMajesty of the great God any longer, which yet tenders a Reconciliation\r\nto you. Remember what was once said over the perishing _Jerusalem_. _How\r\noften would I have gathered you together, as a hen doth gather her brood\r\nunder her winge, and ye would not? Behold, your _House_ is left unto you\r\ndesolate._--For do not think it impossible, that we should become the most\r\nabandon'd, and barbarous of all the nations under heaven. You know who has\r\nsaid it: _He turneth a fruitfull land into a Wildernesse, for the iniquity\r\nof them that inhabit therein._ And truly, he that shall seriously consider\r\nthe sad _Catastrophe_ of the _Eastern Empire_, so flourishing in piety,\r\npolicy, knowledg, literature, and all the excellencies of a happy and\r\nblessed people; would almost think it impossible, that in so few years,\r\nand a midst so glorious a light of learning and Religion, so suddain, and\r\npalpable a darknesse, so strange and horrid a barbarity should over-spread\r\nthem, as now we behold in all that goodly tract of the _Turkish_\r\ndominions: And what was the cause of all this, but the giddinesse of a\r\nwanton people, the Schisms and the Heresies in the church, and the\r\nprosperous successes of a rebellious _Impostor_, whose steps we have\r\npursued in so many pregnant instances; giving countenance to those unheard\r\nof impieties, and delusions, as if God be not infinitely merciful, must\r\nneeds involve us under the same disasters? For, whilst there is no order\r\nin the Church, no body of Religion agreed upon, no government established,\r\nand that every man is abandoned to his own deceitfull heart: whilst\r\nlearning is decried, and honesty discountenanc'd, rapine defended, and\r\nvertue finds no advocate; what can we in reason expect, but the most\r\ndirefull expressions of the wrath of God, a universall desolation, when by\r\nthe industry of _Sathan_ and his crafty Emissaries, some desperate\r\n_enthusiasme_, compounded (like that of _Mohomet_,) of Arian, Socinian,\r\nJew, Anabaptist, and the impurer _Gnostick_, something I say made up of\r\nall these heresies, shall diffuse it self over the Nation, in a universall\r\ncontagion, and nothing lesse appear then the _Christian_ which we have\r\ningratefully renounced?\r\n\r\n_For this plague is already beginning amongst us, and there is none to\r\ntake the Censer, and to stand between the living and the dead, that we be\r\nnot consumed as in a moment; for there is wrath gone out from the Lord._\r\nLet us then _depart from the tents of these wicked men_ (who have brought\r\nall this upon us) _and touch nothing of theirs, lest we be consumed in all\r\ntheir sins_.\r\n\r\nBut you will say, the King is not to be trusted: judg not of others by\r\nyour selves; did ever any man observe the least inclination of revenge in\r\nhis breast? has he not betides the innate propensity of his own nature to\r\ngentlenesse, the strict injunctions of a dying father and a _Martyr_, to\r\nforgive even greater offenders then you are? Yes, I dare pronounce it with\r\nconfidence, and avouch it whith all assurance, that there is not an\r\nindividuall amongst you, whose crimes are the most crimson, whom he will\r\nnot be most ready to pardon, and graciously receive upon their repentance;\r\nnor any thing that can be desired of him, to which he would not cheerfully\r\naccommode, for the stopping of that torrent of blood, and extream\r\nconfusion, which has hitherto run, and is yet imminent over us. Do but\r\nreason a little with your self, and confider sadly, whether a young\r\nPrince, mortified by so many afflictions, disciplin'd by much experience,\r\nand instructed by the miscarriages of others, be not the most excellently\r\nqualified to govern and reduce a people, who have so succeslesly tried so\r\nmany governments, of old, impious and crafty Foxes, that have exercised\r\nupon us the most intollerable Tyrannies that were ever heard of?\r\n\r\nBut you object further, that he has lived amongst Papists, is vitiously\r\ninclin'd, and has wicked men about him: What can be said more unjustly,\r\nwhat more malitious? And can _you_ have the foreheads to tell us he has\r\nlived amongst Papists to his prejudice, who have proscrib'd him from\r\nProtestants, persecuted him from place to place, _as a Patridg on the\r\nMountains_? You may remember who once went to _Achich the King of Gath and\r\nchanged his behaviour before them, and fain'd himself mad in their hands_;\r\nhad many great infirmities, and _was yet a man after Gods own heart_;\r\nWhilst the Catholick King was your Allie, you had nothing to do with\r\nPapists, it was then no crime: _God is not mocked, away with this respect\r\nof persons_: But where is it you would have him to be? The _Hollander_\r\ndares not afford him harbour, lest you refuse them yours: The _French_ may\r\nnot give him bread for fear of offending you; and unless he should go to\r\nthe _Indies_, or the _Turk_ (where yet your malice would undoubtedly reach\r\nhim) where can he be safe from your revenge? But suppose him in a Papist\r\nCountrey, constrained thereto by your incharity to his Soul as well as\r\nbody; would he have condescended to half so much, as you have offered for\r\na toleration of Papists, he needed not now have made use of this Apology,\r\nor wanted the assistance of the most puissant Princes of _Christendome_ to\r\nrestore him, of whom he has refused such conditions as in prudence he\r\nmight have yielded to, and the people would have gladly received; whilst\r\nthose who know with what persons you have transacted, what truck you have\r\nmade with the _Jesuites_, what secret Papists there are amongst you, may\r\neasily divine why they have been no forwarder to assist him, and how far\r\ndistant he is from the least wavering in his Faith. But since you have now\r\ndeclared that you will tollerate all Religions, without exception; do not\r\nthink it a sin in him, to gratifie those that shall most oblige him.\r\n\r\nFor his vertues and Morality, I provoak the most refined Family in this\r\nNation to produce me a Relation of more piety and moderation; shew me a\r\nFraternity more spotlesse in their honour, and freer from the exorbitances\r\nof youth, then these three Brothers, so conspicuous to all the world for\r\ntheir Temperance, Magnanimity, Constancy, and Understanding; a friendship\r\nand humility unparallel'd, and rarely to be found amongst the severest\r\npersons, scarcely in a private family. It is the malice of a very black\r\nSoul, and a virulent _Renegado_ (of whom to be commended were the utmost\r\ninfamy) that has interpreted some compliances, to which persons in\r\ndistress are sometimes engaged, with those whom they converse withall, to\r\nhis Majesties disadvantage: _whilst these filthy dreamers defile the flesh\r\nthemselves, and thinking it no sin to despise dominion, speak evill of\r\ndignities, and of the things which they know not. But woe unto them, for\r\nthey have gone in the way of Kain, and run greedily after the errour of\r\nBalaam, for reward, having mens persons in admiration because of\r\nadvantage._\r\n\r\nFor the rest, I suppose the same was said of Holy _David_, when in his\r\nextream calamity, he was constrain'd to fly from _Saul_. _For every one\r\nthat was in distresse, and every one that was in debt, and every one that\r\nwas discontented, gathered themselves unto him, and he became Captain over\r\nthem._ And to this retinue, has your malice and persecution reduced this\r\nexcellent Prince; but he that preserv'd him in the Wood, _and delivered\r\nDavid out of all his troubles_, shall likewise in his appointed time,\r\ndeliver him also out of these distresses.\r\n\r\nI have now answered all your calumnies, and have but a word to add, that I\r\nmay yet incline you to accept of your best interest, and prevent that\r\ndreadfull ruine which your obstinacy does threaten. Is it not as\r\nperspicuous as the Sun, that it lies in your power to reform his Counsell,\r\nintroduce your selves, make what composition you can desire, have all the\r\nsecurity that mortall men can imagine, and the greatest Princes of Europe\r\nto engage in the performance? This were becoming worthy men, and\r\nhonourable indeed; this ingenuous self-denyall: And it is no disgrace to\r\nreforme a mistake, but to persist in it lyes the shame. The whole Nation\r\nrequire it of you, and the lawes of God command it, you cannot, you must\r\nnot deferr it. For what can you pretend that will not then drop into your\r\nbosomes? The humble man will have repose, the aspiring and ambitious,\r\nhonours: The Merchant will be secure, Trades immediately recover, Aliances\r\nwill be confirm'd, the Lawes reflourish, tender Consciences consider'd,\r\npresent purchasers satisfied; the Souldier payed, maintained and provided\r\nfor; and what's above all this, Christianity and Charity will revive again\r\namongst us, _Mercy and Truth will meet together; righteousness and peace\r\nshall kiss each other_.\r\n\r\nBut let us now consider on the other side, the confusion, which must of\r\nnecessity light upon us if we persist in our rebellion and obstinacy; We\r\nare already impoverisht, and consum'd with war and the miseries that\r\nattend it; you have wasted our treasure, and destroyed the Woods, spoyled\r\nthe Trade, and shaken our properties; a universall animosity is in the\r\nvery bowells of the Nation; the Parent against the Children, and the\r\nChildren against the Parents, betraying one another to the death; in\r\nsumme, if that have any truth which our B. _Saviour_ has himself\r\npronounced, _That a Kingdome divided cannot stand_, it is impossible we\r\nshould subsist in the condition we are reduc'd to. Consider we again, how\r\nridiculous our late proceedings have made us to our neighbours round about\r\nus. Their _Ministers_ laugh at our extream{4} giddinesse, and we seem to\r\nmock at their addresses: for no sooner do their _Credentialls_ arrive,\r\nbut behold the scean is changed, and the Government is fled, he that now\r\nacted King, left a fool in his place, and they stand amazed at out\r\n_Buffoonery_ and madnesse.\r\n\r\nWhat then may we imagine will be the product of all these disadvantages,\r\nwhen the Nations that deride and hate us, shall be united for our\r\ndestruction; and that the harvest is ripe for the sickle of their fury?\r\nshall we not certainly be a prey to an inevitable ruine, having thus\r\nweakned our selves by a brutish civill war, and cut off those glorious\r\n_Heros_, the wise and the valiant, whose courage in such a calamity we\r\nshall in vain imploar, that would bravely have sacrificed themselves for\r\nour delivery? Let us remember how often we have served a forraign people,\r\nand that there is nothing so confident, but a provoked God can overthrow.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I tremble, but to consider what may be the issue of these\r\nthings, when our iniquities are full, and that God shall make inquisition\r\nfor the bloud that has been spilt; unlesse we suddainly meet him by an\r\nunfained repentance, and turn from all the abominations by which we have\r\nprovoaked him; And then, it is to be hoped, that he who would have\r\ncompounded with the _Father of the faithfull_, had there been but ten\r\nRighteous men in _Sodom_; and that spared _Nineveh_ that populous and\r\ngreat City; will yet have mercy on us, hearken to the prayers, and have\r\nregard to the teares, of so many Millions of people, who day and night do\r\ninterceed with him: The _Priests_ and Ministers _of the Lord weeping\r\nbetween the porch and the Altar, and saying, Spare thy people O Lord,\r\nspare thy People, and give not thine Inheritance to reproach_.\r\n\r\nAnd now I have said what was upon my Spirit for your sake, when, for the\r\nsatisfaction of such as (through its effect upon your soule) this Addresse\r\nof mine may possibly come to, I have religiously declared, that the Person\r\nwho writ it, had no unworthy or sinister design of his owne to gratifie,\r\nmuch lesse any other party whatever; as being neither _Courtier_,\r\n_Souldier_, or _Church-man_, but a plain Country Gentleman, engag'd on\r\nneither side, who, has had leisure, (through the goodnesse of God)\r\ncandidly, and without passion to examine the particulars which he has\r\ntouched, and expects no other reward in the successe of it, then what\r\n_Christ_ has promised in the _Gospels_: The _Benediction{5} of the peace\r\nmaker_; and which he already feels in the discharge of his Conscience\r\nbeing for his own particular, long since resolv'd with himself, to persist\r\nin his Religion, and his loyalty to the death; come what will; as\r\nwrongfully perswaded, that all the persecutions, losses, and other\r\naccidents which may arrive him for it here, _are not worthy to be compared\r\nto that eternall{6} weight of glory which is to be revealed hereafter_;\r\nand to the inexpressible consolation, which it will afford on his\r\n_Death-bed_, when all these guilded pleasures will disappear, this noise,\r\nand empty pompe, when God shall _set all out sins in order before us_; and\r\nwhen, it is certain, that the humble, and the peaceable, the charitable\r\nand the meek shall not loose their reward, not change their hopes, for all\r\nthe Crownes and the Scepters, the Lawrells and the Trophies which\r\nambitious and self seeking men contend for, with so much Tyrannie and\r\ninjustice.\r\n\r\nLet them therefore no longer deceive you, dear Sr. and as the guise of\r\nthese vile men is, tell you they are the Godly-party, under which for the\r\npresent they would pass, and _courage themselves in their wickedness_,\r\nstoping their ears, and shutting their eyes against all that has been\r\ntaught and practised by the best of Christians, & holiest of Saints these\r\nsixteen hundred years: _You shall know them by their fruites, do men\r\ngather Grapes of Thornes, or Figs of Thistles?_ But so, being miserably\r\ngall'd with the remembrance of their impieties, and the steps by which\r\nthey have ascended to those fearfull precepices, they seek to allay the\r\nsecret pangs of a gnawing worme, by adopting the most prodigious of their\r\ncrimes into a Religion fitted for the purpose, and versatile as their\r\ngiddy interest, till at last, encourag'd by the number of thriving\r\nProselytes and successes, they grow feared and confident; swallowing all\r\nwith ease, and passing from one heresie to another; whilst yet they are\r\nstill pursued, and shalt never be at repose: For Conscience will at last\r\nawake, and then how frightful, how deplorable, yea, how inexpressably sad\r\nwill that day be unto them! _For these things have they done, and I held\r\nmy tongue _(saith God)_ and they thought wickedly, that I am such a one as\r\nthemselves; but I will reprove them and set before them the things that\r\nthey have done. O consider this ye that forget God, least he pluck you\r\naway, and there be none to deliver you!_\r\n\r\nAnd now _Sir_, you see the liberty which I have taken, and how farr I have\r\nadventured to testifie a friendship which I have ever professed for you: I\r\nhave indeed been very bold; but it was greatly requisite; and you know\r\nthat amongst all men there are none which more openly use the freedom of\r\nreprehension, then those who love most: Advices are not rejected by any,\r\nbut such as determine to pursue their evill courses; and the language\r\nwhich I use, is not to offend, but to beseech you to return. I conjure you\r\ntherefore to re-enter into your self, and not to suffer these mean and\r\ndishonourable respects, which are unworthy your nobler spirit, to prompt\r\nyou to a course so deform'd, and altogether unworthy your education and\r\nFamily. Behold your friends all deploaring your misfortunes, and your\r\nEnemies even pitie you; whilst to gratifie a few mean and desperate\r\npersons, you cancell your duty to your prince, and disband your Religion;\r\ndishonour your name, bring ruine and infamy on your posterity.\r\n\r\nBut when all this shall fail (as God forbid a title of it should) _I_ have\r\nyet this hope remaining; that when you have been sufficiently fated with\r\nthis wicked course, wandred from place to place, government to government,\r\nsect to sect, in so universal a deluge, and find no repose for the sole of\r\nyour foot (as it is certain you never shal) you with at last with the\r\npeaceful _Dove_, return to the Arke from whence you fled, to your first\r\nprinciples, and to sober counsels; or with the repenting _Prodigall_ in\r\nthe Gospel, to _your Father_ which is in heaven, and to the _Father of\r\nyour Countrey_: For in so doing, you shall not only rejoyce your servant,\r\nand all good men, but the very _Angels_ which are in heaven, and who are\r\nnever said to rejoyce indeed, but _at the Conversion of a sinner_.\r\n\r\n_This 27.

And if\r\nin these expressions of it, and the formes we use, it were possible to\r\nexceed, and so offend your Modesty; herein only (great Sir) do we not fear\r\nto disobey you; since it is not in your power to deny us our rejoycing,\r\nnor indeed in ours, to moderate. Permit us therefore (O best of Kings) to\r\nfollow our genius, and to consecrate your Name, and this dayes exaltation\r\nto that posterity which you alone have preserved, and which had certainly\r\nseen its period, but for your happy Restauration; so that your Majesty\r\ndoes not so much accept a benefit from, as give it to your Subjects. For\r\nthough the fulness of this Dayes joy, be like the seven years of plenty;\r\nyet, is that bread far more sweet, which is eaten with remembrance of the\r\npast Famine (too bitter, alas! to be forgotten on the suddain) especially,\r\nwhen it may serve to illustrate our present felicity, and conduce to your\r\nMajesties glory: For so the skillful Artist, studious of making a\r\nsurprising peice, or representing some irradiated Deity, deepens the\r\nshadowes sometimes with the darkest touches, and approaching to horrour\r\nit self, thereby to render his lights the more refulgent, and striking in\r\nthe eyes of the Spectator.\r\n\r\nLet us then call to mind (and yet for ever cursed be the memory of it)\r\nthose dismal clouds, which lately orespread us, when we served the lusts\r\nof those immane Usurpers, greedy of power, that themselves might be under\r\nnone; Cruel, that they might murther the Innocent without cause; Rich,\r\nwith the publick poverty; strong, by putting the sword into the hands of\r\nfuries, and prosperous by unheard of perfidie. Armies, Battails,\r\nImpeaching, Imprisonment, Arraining, Condemning, Proscribing, Plundring,\r\nGibbets and Executions were the eloquent expressions of our miseries:\r\nThere was no language then heard but of Perjury, Delusion, Hypocrisie{7},\r\nHeresie, Taxes, Excises, Sequestration, Decimation, and a thousand like\r\nbarbarities: In summe, the solitudes were filled with noble Exiles, the\r\nCities with rapacious Theives, the Temples with Sacrilegious Villains;\r\nThey had the spoiles of Provinces, the robbing of Churches, the goods of\r\nthe slain, the Stock of Pupils, the plunder of Loyal Subjects; no\r\nTestament, no State secure, and nothing escaped their cruelty and\r\ninsatiable avarice. For if it be sweet in prosperity, to consider of the\r\npast adventures, if tempests commend the Haven; War, Peace; and our last\r\nsharp sickness, our present Health and Vigour; why should it not delight\r\nyour Majesty to hear of the miseries we have suffered; since they\r\nre-inforce your own felicity, and the benefits which we receive by it?\r\nwhere then should I begin but with thy Calamities, O unfortunate\r\n_England_! who hadst only the priviledge of being miserable, when all the\r\nWorld were happy: But I will not go too for in repeating the sorrowes\r\nwhich are vanish't, or uncover the buried memory of the evils past; least\r\nwhilst we strive to represent the vices of others, we seem to contaminate\r\nyour Sacred purple, or alloy our present rejoycing; since that only is\r\nsign of a perfect and consummate felicity, when even the very remembrance\r\nof evils past, is quite forgotten.\r\n\r\nMiraculous Reverse! O marvel greater then Mans Counsel! who will believe\r\nthat which his eyes do see? what before a twenty years confusion had\r\ndestroy'd; behold a few moneths have restor'd: But the wonder does yet so\r\nmuch more astonish, that the grief was not so universal for having\r\nsuffer'd under such a Tyranny, as for having been so long depriv'd of so\r\nexcellent a Prince: No more then do we henceforth accuse our past\r\nmiseries; All things are by your presence repair'd, and so reflourish; as\r\nif they even rejoyc'd they had once been destroy'd, _Auctior tuis facta\r\nbeneficiis._ So as not only a Diadem binds your sacred Temples this day;\r\nbut you have even crown'd all your Subjects too; so has your auspicious\r\npresence gilded all things; our Churches, Tribunals, Theaters, Palaces,\r\nlift up their heads again; the very fields do laugh and exalt. O happy,\r\nand blessed spring! not so glorious yet with the pride and enamel of his\r\nflowers, the golden corn, and the gemms of the pregnant Vine, as with\r\nthose Lillies and Roses which bloom and flourish in your Chaplet this day,\r\nto which not only these, but even all the productions of nature seem to\r\nbend, and pay their homage.\r\n\r\nAnd let it be a new year, a new _Æra_, to all the future Generations, as\r\nit is the beginning of this, and of that immense, _Platonic_ Revolution;\r\nfor what could arrive more justly, more stupendious, were even the eight\r\nsphear it self now hurled about? For no sooner came our _CHARLES_ on\r\nshore, but every Man was in the Haven where he would be; the storm\r\nUniversally ceas'd, and every one ran forth to see our _Palladium, tanquam\r\ncoelo delapsum_: Virgins, Children, Women, trembling old Men, venerating\r\nthe very ship that wafted our _Jason_ and his _Heroes_, ravish'd with the\r\nsight, yet hardly believing for astonishment; the greatness of the\r\nmiracle, oppressing our sences, and endangering our very faith.\r\n\r\n    _Credetne hoc olim ventura posteritas?_\r\n\r\nI would prayse you Great Prince, but having begun; where shall I make an\r\nend? since there remains not a Topic through all that kind, but one might\r\nwrite Decads of it, without offending the truth, were it as secure of your\r\nmodesty; since I am as well to consider what your ears can suffer, as what\r\nis owing to your Virtues: On what heads shall I extend then my discourse?\r\nyour Birth, Country, Form, Education, Manners, Studies, Friends, Honours\r\nand Fortune run through all partitions of the Demonstrative: An Orator\r\ncould have nothing more to wish for, nor your Majesty to render you more\r\naccomplish'd.\r\n\r\nShall I consider then your Majesty as you were a Son to that glorious\r\nFather before his _Apotheosis_? As you were your self a Confessor after\r\nit; As you are now thus day in your Zenith and exaltation; and as we\r\nAugure you will by Gods blessing prove to your Subjects hereafter: For\r\neven through all these does our prospect lead us; Nor may it be objected\r\nthat what shall be spoken of your Majesty, can be applied to any other;\r\nsince the Fortune and Events of the rest of Princes, have been so\r\ndiffering from yours; as seeming to have been conducted by Men alone, and\r\nsecond Causes; yours only by God, and as it were by Miracle.\r\n\r\nI begin then with your early Piety to that Kingly Martyr whose Sacred\r\ndictates did institute your tender years, and whose sufferings were so\r\nmuch alleviated by your Majesties early proficiency in all that might\r\npresage a hopefull and glorious Successor: For so did you run through all\r\nhis Vicissitudes, during that implacable war, which sought nothing more\r\nthen to defeat you of all opportunities of a Princely education, as\r\nfearing your future Virtues; because they knew the stock from whence you\r\nsprung, was not to be destroy'd by wounding the body, so long as such a\r\nBranch remained.\r\n\r\n    _Duris ut ilex tonsa bipennibus\r\n    Nigræ feraci frondis in Algido,\r\n      Per damna, per cædes, ab ipso\r\n      Ducit opes, animumque ferro._\r\n\r\nWhilst he Reign'd and Govern'd, you learn'd only to obey; Living your own\r\nPrincely Impress; [SN: _ICH DIEN._] as knowing it would best instruct you\r\none day how to Command, and which we now see accomplish'd: These then are\r\nthe effects, when Princes are the Sons of Nobles; since only such know\r\nbest to support the weight, who use to bear betimes, and by degrees; not\r\nthose who rashly pull it on their shoulders; because they take it with\r\nless violence, less ambition, less jealousie: None so secure a Prince, as\r\nhe that is so born.\r\n\r\nBut no sooner did that blessed Martyr expire, then our redivive\r\n_Phoenix_ appear'd; rising from those Sacred Ashes Testator and Heir;\r\nFather and yet Son; Another, and yet the same; introsuming as it were his\r\nSpirit, as he breath'd it out, when singing his own Epicedium and\r\nGenethliack together, he seem'd prodigal of his own life to have it\r\nredouble'd in your felicity: Thus, _Rex nunquam moritur_. O admirable\r\nconduct of the Divine Providence, to immortalize the image of a just\r\nMonarch: _Ipsa quidem, sed non eadem, quia & ipsa, nec ipsa est._ Since\r\nthat may as truly be apply'd to your Majesty, which was once to the wisest\r\nof Kings: _Mortuus est Pater ejus, & quasi non mortuus, similem enim\r\nreliquit sibi post se._\r\n\r\nBut with how much prudence, is serenity attributed amongst the titles of\r\nPrinces, and the beams of the sun to irradiate their Crowns; That the\r\nScepter bears a Flower; since as that glorious planet produces, so does it\r\nalso wither them; and there is nothing lasting, save their vertues, which\r\nare indeed their essential parts, and only immortal; For even yet did the\r\nclouds intercept our day with the continuance of so dismall a storm, as it\r\nobnubilated all those hopes of ours. It is an infinite adventure, if in a\r\nPrinces Family [HW: Firmament] (once overcast) it ever grow fair weather\r\nagain, but by a singular and extraordinary providence. I mention this to\r\nincrease the wonder, and reinforce your felicity. Empires passe, Kingdomes\r\nare translated, and dominions cease: The _Cecropides_ of old, the\r\n_Arsacides_, the _Theban_, _Corinthian_, _Syracusian_, and sundry more\r\nlasted nor to the fourth Age without strange and prodigious tragedies; but\r\nwhy go we so far back, when a few Centuries present us with so many fresh\r\nRevolutions? How many nests has the _Roman_ Eagle changed? _Bulgarian_,\r\n_Saracen_, _Latine_; In the _Comneni_, _Isaaci_, _Paleologi_, &c. even\r\ntill it dash'd it self in pieces against the _Oetoman_ rock. What\r\nmutations have been in the house of _Arragon_? How many Riders has the\r\n_Parthenopean_ horse unsaddl'd and flung? How many _Sicily_? What changes\r\nhave been in _Italy_, What in _France_, and indeed through all _Europe_ by\r\n_Vandals_, _Saxons_, _Danes_, _Normans_, by external invasion, internal\r\nFaction, Envy, Ambition, treachery and violence? The _Consulate_\r\ndegenerated into _Oligarchy_, which occasion'd the _Aventine_ sedition;\r\nDemocraty into _Ochlocraty_ under the _Tribunes_ and wicked _Gracchi_; and\r\n_Monarchy_ it self, (the very best of Governments) into Tyranny.\r\n\r\nIndeed your sacred Majesty was cast out of your Kingdoms, but could never\r\nbe thrown out of our hearts; There, you had a secure seat; and the Prince\r\nthat is inthron'd there, is safe in all mutations; Keep there Sir, and you\r\nare inexpugnable, immoveable. And how should it otherwayes be? A Prince of\r\nyour virtue could not miscarry, that being truly verified of Your Majesty,\r\nas well in your perfections, as your person, _Certe, videtis quem elegit\r\nDominus in Regem, quoniam non sit similis illi in omni populo._ Nature\r\ndesign'd your Majesty a King, Fortune makes others; nor are you more your\r\npeoples by birth, and a glorious _series_ of Progenitors, then by your\r\nmerits: This appeared in all those digits of your darkest Eclipse; The\r\ndefect was ours, not your Majesties. For the Sun is alwaies shining,\r\nthough men alwaies see him not; and since the too great splendor, and\r\nprosperity did confound us, it pleased God to interpose those clouds, till\r\nwe should be better able to behold you with more reverence and security;\r\nFor then it was that you prepar'd your self for this weighty government,\r\nand gave us those presages of your Virtue, by what you did, for your\r\npeople, and what you suffered for them; signalizing your Courage, your\r\nFortitude, Constancy, Piety, Prudence and Temperance upon all occasions.\r\nYour Travels and Adventures are as far beyond those of _Ulysses_, as you\r\nexceed him in Dominions; _Si quis enim velit percensere Cæsaris res, totum\r\nprofecto terrarum orbem enumeret_: For he must go very far that would sum\r\nup your perfections: Your skill in the customes of Nations, the situations\r\nof Kingdomes, the Advantages of places, the temper of the Climates; so as\r\nthe Ages to come shall tell with delight, where you fought valiantly,\r\nwhere you suffered gallantly, _Quis sudores tuos hauserit campus, quæ\r\nrefectiones tuas arbores, quæ somnum saxa prætexerint, quod denique tectum\r\nmagnus hospes impleveris_, and all those sacred _Vestigia_ of yours: Thus\r\nwhat was once applyed to _Trajan_, becomes due to your Majesty, and I my\r\nself am witness both abroad, and at home, of what I pronounce, having now\r\nbeheld you in both fortunes with love and admiration; But this is not\r\nhalfe, and to stop at single perfections, were to give jealousie to the\r\nrest yet untouched, and should I but succinctly number them all, were not\r\nto weave a Panegyrick, but an Inventory.\r\n\r\nBut amongst all your Vertues none was more eminent then your constancy to\r\nyour religion, which no shocks of Fortune, no assaults of sophisters,\r\nevents and successe of adversaries, or offers of specious Friends could\r\nshake; so great a thing it was that you did persevere, so much greater\r\n_quod non timuisti ne perseverare non posses_.\r\n\r\nBut whilst Armies on earth fought for the Usurper, the Hosts of Heaven\r\nfought in their courses for your Majesty; [SN: _Spaine._] dashing your\r\ngreatest enemy upon that Rock, which afforded you shelter, till that\r\nTyranny was over past: And how welcome to Us was that blessed day _qui\r\ntyrannum abstulit pessimum, Principem dedit optimum_! He liv'd by storming\r\nothers, dyed in one himself, _& post Nubila, Phoebus_. Yet did not that\r\nquite dissolve our fears, till that other head of _Hydra_ was cut off,\r\nthat despicable Rump which succeeded, not by the sword, or any humane\r\naddresse, least we should sacrifice to our own Nets; but by the immediate\r\nhand of heaven, without noise, without Armes, or stratageme, the fame of\r\nyour vertues, more then the sense of our own misery, universally turning\r\nthe hearts even of your very Enemies; and then that Northern Star began\r\nthe dawning of this day, till your nearer approach did guild our Horizon,\r\nbrighter then the rayes of the Eastern sun, from whose spicy coast, like a\r\ntrue Phoenix you were to come; For so at the sight of that Royal Bird\r\nwas the memory of _Sesostris_, of _Amasis_ and _Ptolemy_ ever fortunate,\r\nand so was yours to us;\r\n\r\n    _----Tum rusticus ergo\r\n    Suspicit observans volucrem; nam creditur annus\r\n    Ille salutaris----_\r\n\r\nthe happy presages of our glorious Returne, stupendious indeed and almost\r\nindicible: For no sooner did your _Argo_ hoise sail, that the Eagles\r\nthemselves fled not swifter, then the report of your approach from ten\r\nthousand mouthes of brasse, echoing from ship to ship, and shore to shore,\r\nwith their thundring voices, out done yet with the shouts and acclamations\r\nof your glad people, when our shaken Republique rushed at once into your\r\nprincely Armes for safety and _Asylum_, not by the occult power of\r\nDestiny, or blind revolution, but the extraordinary hand of Providence,\r\nwhose _pathes are in the great Waters, and whose footsteps are not known:\r\nO novum atque inauditum ad principatum iter_, who that shall write Annals,\r\nor Verses can ever forget that day? not decrepit age, not the sick, not\r\nthe tender Sex were kept back from resolving to behold that miraculous\r\nentry of yours; The very little children pointed to you, the striplings\r\nand young men exsulted, the Antient men stood amazed, and those who were\r\nunder the empire of a cruel disease, leaped out of their beds, to have the\r\nsight of you, that were the safety of the People, returning with cure and\r\nrefreshment: Others protested, they had even now lived long enough, and\r\nwere ready to expire with joy, and the transports of their spirits; as\r\nsatisfied that this Ball could not present them with an other object\r\nworthy their admiration; others wished now to live more then ever, that\r\nthey might still enjoy their desired object; and women forgetting the\r\npains of childbirth, brought forth with joy, because they gave Citizens to\r\ntheir Prince, and Souldiers now to their lawful Emperour.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty must needs remember, nor is the sound yet out of your sacred\r\nears, when the houses of this your August Metropolis were covered with the\r\nloud and cheerful spectators, because the earth was too narrow to contain\r\nthem; the wayes and the trees were filled with the shouting of your\r\npeople, LONG LIVE KING _CHARLES_ THE _II._ _tamque æqualiter ab omnibus ex\r\nadventu tuo lætitia percepta est, quam omnibus venisti_. For when the wise\r\nArbiter of things began to look down upon us, all things conspir'd to make\r\nus happy; our Deliverance by your Majesty as by another _Moses_, leading\r\nus out of that _Ægyptian_ bondage; or by a nearer resemblance that of the\r\n_Babylonish_ captivity, if not yet farr greater; since God did there only\r\nturne the heart of a Prince to let a nation go: Here, the hearts of a\r\nwhole Nation, to invite a banish'd Prince to come, when no other visible\r\npower interpos'd. Let others boast then of their miracles; we can produce\r\nsuch, as no age, no people under heaven can shew; God moving the hearts of\r\nhis most implacable Enemies in a moment as it were, and those who had been\r\nbefore inhumanely thirsty after your blood, now ready to sacrifice their\r\nown for your safety; _Digna res memoratu! ibat sub ducibus vexillisque\r\nRegiis, hostis aliquando Regius, & signa contra quæ steterat sequebatur_.\r\nBut I suffer [HW: surfeit] with too much Plenty, and what eloquence is\r\nable to expresse the triumph of that your never to be forgotten Entry,\r\nunlesse it be the renewing of it this day? For then were we as those who\r\ndream, and can yet hardly be perswaded, that we are truly awake: _Dies\r\nille æternis seculis monumentisque mandandus_, A day never to be forgotten\r\nin all our Generations, but to be consecrated to posterity, transmitted to\r\nfuture Ages, and inserted into Monuments more lasting then Brasse. Away\r\nthen with these Woodden and temporary Arches, to be taken down by the\r\nPeople at pleasure; erect Marble ones, lasting as the Pyramids, and\r\nimmovable as the mountains themselves, and when they fail, let the memory\r\nof it still remain engraven in our Hearts, Books, Records, _novissimo haud\r\nperitura die_.\r\n\r\nAnd yet not this altogether, because we have received a Prince, but such a\r\nPrince, whose state and fortune in all this blessed change, we so much\r\nadmire not, as his mind; For that is truly felicity, not to possesse\r\ngreat things, but to be thought worthy of them: And indeed Great Sir,\r\nnecessity constrains me, and the laws of _Panegyric_, to verifie it in\r\nyour Praises, by running over at least those other Appellations, which\r\nboth your vertue has given to your Majesty, and your Fortune acquir'd. For\r\nhe is really no King who possesses not (like you) a Kingly mind, be his\r\nother advantages what they may: If the Republick belong then to _Cæsar_,\r\n_Cæsar_ belongs much more to the Republick; and of this you have given\r\nproof.\r\n\r\nFor no sooner were we possess'd of your sacred Majestie, but you suddainly\r\ngave form to our confused _Chaos_: We presently saw when you had taken the\r\nreigns into your sacred hands, and began to sit at Sterne, our deviating\r\nand giddy course grow steady, and the fluctuating Republick at drift ready\r\nto put into a secure Port.\r\n\r\nYou began your Entry with an act of general Clemency, and to make good the\r\nadvice of your Martyr'd Father, and the best Religion, forgave you\r\nbitterest Enemies; and not only barely forgiving, but by an excesse of\r\ncharity, doing honour to some, _ut nemo sibi victus te victore videatur_.\r\nThis was plainly Godlike: For so rare a thing we find it, that Princes\r\nthink themselves oblig'd; or if they think it, that they love it; that\r\nyour example will reproach all who went before you: As you promis'd, so\r\nyou perform'd it, punctually, and with advantage. Nor indeed do you desire\r\nany thing should be permitted your Majesty, but what is indulg'd your\r\nVassals, subjecting even your self to those Lawes by which you oblige your\r\nSubjects; For as it is a great felicity to be able to do what one will, so\r\nis it much more glorious, to will only what is just and honourable. All\r\nother Princes before your Majesty spake as much; you only have performed\r\nit; nor is there a Tittle of your engagements, which even your very\r\nenemies diffide of, much lesse your Friends suspect: They enjoy, and these\r\nhope; because those were to be conciliated by present effects, these are\r\nsecure by past promises; and none that receives them of your Majesty\r\nreckons from the time they injoy it, but the period of your promise;\r\nbecause it proceeds (they know) from a Princely and candid mind; and if it\r\nseem long in acquiring, it is not (I perswade my self) because you are\r\ndifficult, much less unmindful; but that the benefit may be more\r\nacceptable, and the sense of it more permanent; since too suddain felicity\r\nastonishes, and sometimes renders the Recipient ingrateful, whilst your\r\nfavours are not fugitive but certain. It was only for Your Majestie to be\r\ncompleatly happie, when you began to be so; and yet your subjects had as\r\nmuch as they could well support; since you have made it your only\r\nbusinesse to sublevate the needie, and give them as it were a new Fate,\r\nyour piety not more appearing in pardoning your Enemies, and receiving the\r\nPenitent, then your justice in restoring the Oppressed: For how many are\r\nsince your returne, return'd to their own Homes, to their Wives, Children,\r\nOffices, and Patrimonies? _Addiditque Dominus omnia quæ fuerant Jobi\r\nduplicia_; some of them with immense advantages; and of this the\r\nlanguishing _Church of England_ is a most eminent instance; That she,\r\nwhich was first and most afflicted, should be first and chiefly refreshed.\r\n\r\nYou have taken away the affluence to the Committees, Sequestrators,\r\nConventicles, and unjust Slaughter-houses, and converted their zeal to the\r\nTemples, the Courts, and the just Tribunals: Magnanimity is return'd\r\nagain to the Nobility, Modesty to the People, Obedience to Subjects,\r\nCharity to Neighbours, Pietie to Children, Fidelity to Servants, and\r\nReverence to Religion; In summe, You are the Restorer of Your Countrie.\r\n\r\nThe lawes that were lately quiescent, and even trampled under foot, your\r\nMajesty has revived; and been yet so prudent in reforming, that even those\r\nwhich your Enemies made upon good deliberation, you permit to stand,\r\nshewing your self rather to have been displeased with the Authours, then\r\nthe Things.\r\n\r\nAs to Discipline (after the sacrifice due for that innocent blood of your\r\nglorious Father) you are not only careful to reject vice your self; but\r\nare severe to discountenance it in others; and that yet so sweetly, as you\r\nseem rather to perswade then compell; and to cure without a corrosive.\r\n\r\nThe Army is disbanded, and the Navy paid off without Tumult; because you\r\nare trusted without suspicion, and are more secure in the publick love and\r\naffection of your people then in men of Iron, the locks and Bars of\r\nTyrants Palaces: And truely Sir, there is no protection to innocency,\r\nwhich is a fort inexpugnable: In vain therefore do Princes confide in any\r\nother; for Armes invite Armes, Terrour, suspition. To this only do you\r\ntrust, and the few which you maintain about your person, is rather for\r\nstate, then fear. _Quid enim istis opus est, quum firmissimo sis muro\r\nCivici amoris obtectus?_ Here is then the firm Keeper of our Liberties\r\nindeed, whom the Armies love for His own sake, and whom no servile\r\nflattery adores; but a simple, and sincere devotion; and verily such a\r\nPrince as Your Majesty, deserves to have friends, Prompt, steady and\r\nfaithful; such as You have, and which Virtue rather then Fortune procures.\r\nOf this I obtest the fidelity of Your own inviolable Party, distinguished\r\nformerly by the invidious name of _Cavalier_, though significant and\r\nglorious; but I provoke the World to produce me an example of parallel\r\nLoyaltie: What Prince under heaven, after so many losses, and all\r\nimaginable calamities, can boast of such a party? The _Grecians_ forsook\r\ntheir Leaders upon every sleight disaster; the very _Romans_ were not\r\nsteady of old, but followed the fortune of the Common Victor. The _German_\r\nand the _French_ will happily stick to their Prince in distresse, as far\r\nas the Plate, the Tapistry, or some such superfluous moveable may abide\r\nthe pawn; But where shall we find a Subject that hath persisted like Your\r\nMajesties, to the losse of Libertie, Estate, and life it self, when yet\r\nall seem'd to be determin'd against them; so as even their enemies were at\r\nlast vanquish'd with their constancy, and their very Tormentors wearied\r\nwith their insuperable Patience; nor can they in all that tract of Time,\r\nhardly brag of having made one signal _Proselyte_ in twenty Years that\r\nthis difference continu'd; and that because the obedience of your\r\nMajesties Subjects, is engraffed into their Religion and Institution, as\r\nwell as into the adoration of Your Virtues.\r\n\r\nI would not therefore that Your Name should be painted upon Banners, or\r\nCarved in stone, _sed Monumentis æternæ laudis_; and Your Majesty did well\r\nforesee, and consult it, when you furnish'd a Subject for our\r\n_Panegyrics_, and our Histories, which should outlast those frail\r\nmaterials. The Statues of _Cæsar_, _Brutus_ and _Camillus_ were set up\r\nindeed because they chased their enemies from the Walls of a proud Citie;\r\nYou have done it from a whole Kingdom; not (as they) by blood and\r\nslaughter, but by your prudence and Counsels: Nor is it lightly to be\r\npassed over, that your Majesty was preserved in that _Royal Oak_, to whom\r\na Civical Crown should so justly become due.\r\n\r\nBut I now arrive to the _Lawes_ you have made, and the excellent things\r\nwhich your Majestie hath done since you came amongst Your people. Truely,\r\nthere is hardly an hour to be reckoned wherein your Majesty has not done\r\nsome signal benefit. I have already touch'd a few of them, as what\r\nconcern'd the most, I would I could say the best; for you have oblig'd\r\nyour very Enemies, You have bought them; since never was there, till now,\r\nso prodigious a summe paid, a summe hardly in Nature, to verifie a Word\r\nonly; and which the zeal of Your good Subjects (had you taken the\r\nadvantage of the fervour which I but now mentioned, at Your wonderful\r\nReception) might easily have absolv'd You of; had You paid them in kind,\r\nand as they were wont to keep faith with your Majestie. I provoke the\r\nWorld again to furnish an instance of a like generositie, unlesse he climb\r\nup to heaven for it. How black then must that ingratitude needs appear,\r\nwhich should after all this, dare to rebell; Or, for the future once\r\nmurmur at Your Government? Since it was no necessity that compell'd You,\r\nbut an excesse of your good nature, and your charitie.\r\n\r\nYour Majestie has abolished the _Court of Wards_; I cannot say we have\r\nfreed ourselves in desiring it, if it were possible to hope for so\r\nindulgent a Father as Your Majestie is to Your Countrie, in those who\r\nshall succeed You.\r\n\r\nThe _Compositions_ You have likewise eased us of, if that could be\r\nesteem'd a burthen, to serve so excellent a Prince, who receives nothing\r\nof his Subjects but what he returnes again in the Noblest and worthiest\r\nHospitality, that any Potentate in earth can produce; Thus what the Rivers\r\npay to the Ocean, it returns again in showers to replenish them. But Your\r\nMajestie would dissipate even the very shadows, which give us umbrage; and\r\nrather part with your own just right, then those few of your Subjects\r\nwhich it concern'd, should think themselves aggreiv'd, though by a mistake\r\neven of their duty.\r\n\r\n[SN: _His Majesties Declaration._] But I should first have mention'd your\r\nsettlement of the _Church_, and Your bringing back the Ark of God: Your\r\nMajesties wise composure of our Frailties, and tendernesse as well in the\r\nReligious as the Secular; whilst yet You continue fervent to maintain what\r\nis decent, and what is setled by Law. But what language is capable to\r\nexpresse this Article? Let those who wait at the Altar, and to which you\r\nhave restor'd the daily sacrifice, supply the defect of this period, and\r\ncelebrate your piety.\r\n\r\nNor has yet Your zeal to the Church, lessen'd that which is due to the\r\nCommon-wealth; witnesse your industry in erecting a _Counsel of Trade_, by\r\nwhich alone you have sufficiently verified that expression of your\r\nMajesties in your Declaration from _Breda_, That You would propose some\r\nuseful things for the publick emolument of the Nation, which should render\r\nit opulent, splendid and flourishing; making good your pretence to the\r\nuniversall Soveraignty by Your Princely care, as well as by your birth and\r\nundoubted Title.\r\n\r\nYou have Restor'd, Adorn'd, and Repair'd our Courts of Judicature,\r\nturning the Shambles where your Subjects were lately butcher'd, into a\r\nTribunal, where they may now expect due Justice; and have furnish'd the\r\nSupreame seat there with a _Chancelour_ of antient candor, rare\r\nexperience; just, prudent, learned and faithfull; in summe, one, whose\r\nmerits beget universal esteem, and is amongst the greatest indications of\r\nyour Majesties skill in persons, as well as in their Talents and\r\nperfections to serve you. Thus you have gratified the long robe, so as now\r\nagain,\r\n\r\n           _Te propter colimus leges, animosque ferarum\r\n    Exuimus_----And there is hope we may again be civiliz'd.\r\n\r\nFor you are (we hear) publishing _Sumptuary Lawes_ to represse the\r\nwantonness and excess of Apparel, as you have already testifi'd your\r\nabhorrency of _Duelling_, that infamous and dishonourable gallantry: In\r\nfine, you have establish'd so many excellent constitutions, that you seem\r\nto leave nothing for us to desire, or your Successor to add either in the\r\n_Ethicall_ or _Politicall_.\r\n\r\n    ----_Similem quæ pertulit ætas\r\n    Consilio, vel Marte virum?_----\r\n\r\nO happy _Greece_ for Eloquence, that hast celebrated the fortune of thy\r\n_Heroes_ trifling Adventures! who shall set forth and immortalize the\r\nglory of our illustrious Prince, and advance Great _CHARLES_ to the skies?\r\nYou had Poets indeed that sung the fate of an unfortunate Lady, the theft\r\nof a simple fleece; what wouldst thou have done, had the glorious Actions\r\nof such a King been spread before thee, who has not robbed with Armies,\r\ndepopulated Cities, or violated the Rights of Hospitality; but restor'd a\r\nbroken Nation, repair'd a ruin'd Church, reform'd, and re-establish'd our\r\nancient Laws; in summe, who has at once render'd us perfectly happy? What\r\nthen have we to do with _Augustus_, or _Titus_, with _Trajan_, _Hadrian_,\r\n_Antoninus_, _Theodosius_ or even _Constantine_ himself? There is not in\r\nany, there is not in all these Subjects more worthy of praise, and to\r\nwhich your Majesty; O best of Princes, ought at all to render.\r\n\r\nWe are told _Periculosæ rem aleæ esse, de iis scribere quibus sis\r\nobstrictus_; because it is so difficult to observe a mediocrity, where our\r\naffections are engaged: But your Majesty is as secure from flattery, as\r\nyour Virtues are above its reach; and to write thus of ill Princes, were\r\nboth a shame and a punishment: For this the _Senate_ condemn'd the History\r\nof _Cremutius_ to the flames; and _Spartianus_ told _Dioclesian_ boldly,\r\nhow hard it would be to write their Commentaries, except it were to record\r\ntheir Impudence, Murthers, Injustice, and the (for most part) fatal\r\nperiods of Tyrants; which if any esteem a glory, you envy not, whilst your\r\nMajesty is resolv'd to secure your own by your virtue and your Justice; so\r\nas no age to come shall possibly find an æmulator, or produce an equall.\r\n\r\n    ----_Fuerint aliis hæc forte decora,\r\n    Nulla potest Laus esse tibi quæ crimina purget._\r\n\r\nBut I shall never have done with your obligations of the publick; and the\r\nmeasure which is assign'd me, would be too narrow but to mention briefly\r\nthose your private and interiour perfections which crown your Majesties\r\nPerson, and dazle our eyes more then the bright purple which this day\r\ninvests you. To give instance in some; you are an excellent Master to your\r\nDomesticks. Their Lives, Conversations and Merits as well as Names, and\r\nFaces, are known to your Majesty as the Companions of _Cæsar_ were: Honour\r\nis safe under your Banner, and the Court so well regulated, that there is\r\nno need of _Censors_ to inspect Mens Manners; _vita principis pro censura\r\nest_. He who knowes that every body eyes, speaks and writes of him, cannot\r\nin prudence, or think, or act things unworthy and abject: You Sir direct\r\nall your objects and motions so, as may recommend you to posterity; and\r\neven burn with desires of immortality, so as Histories may relate the\r\nTruth without fear or adulation.\r\n\r\nHow happy then those Servants of yours, whose fidelity and Industry is\r\nknown to your Majesty, not from the interpretation and reports of others,\r\nbut your own experience! So as you Reward as well with Judgment, as\r\nBounty; and verily that is true Beneficence to place your Recompense as\r\nwell equally as freely: Most other Virtues are competent to the rest of\r\nMen; Beneficence only to a Prince, as his most Essential property, and the\r\nnoblest ingredient of his _Elogy_. Hence that great Saint, as well as\r\nCourtier and Prelate has directed, _Si quis Principem laudare vellet,\r\nnihil illi adeo decorum adscriberet quam Magnificentiam_; [SN: _S.\r\nChrysost._] and _Criticks_ observe, that where the wise King _Solomon_\r\nsayes, _Multi colunt personam Principis_, the _Hebrew_ version reads it,\r\n_personam Benefici_, as importing both; and in that of his Who was greater\r\nthen _Solomon_, _Qui dominantur eorum Benefici vocantur_, the _Chaldy_\r\nturnes, _Principes vocantur_, as if by a convertible figure, He could not\r\nbe a Prince who were not Beneficent; nor he that is truly Beneficent,\r\nunworthy of that Title. I remember 'tis somewhere said of _Saul_ that he\r\nReign'd but two years; because he was so long it seems good to his people,\r\nand reigned in their hearts; For as the Sun himself should not be the Sun,\r\nif he did not shine; no more should a Prince be worthy of his dignity, if\r\nhe unjustly Ecclips'd his influence, or abused his Magnificency. But as we\r\nsaid, this virtue is added to your Majesties also; who know so well to\r\nadjust its Definition by your constant practice, rendering it (as indeed\r\nit ought) productive of your will for glorious and honest ends only; But I\r\nnow proceed with the rest.\r\n\r\nThere is such a Majesty in your Countenance, such Lenity in your Eyes,\r\ngravity in your speech, as that for your gracefull presence that may be\r\ntruly affirm'd of you what was once appli'd to a great Prince resembling\r\nyou, _Jam firmitas, Jam proceritas corporis, jam honor Capitis & dignitas\r\noris, ad hoc ætatis indeflexa maturitas, nonne longe lateque principem\r\nostentant?_ since even all these assemble in your Majesties personage; Nor\r\nhas fortune chang'd you after all your Travels and Adventures abroad; but\r\nbrought you back to us not so much as tinged in the percolations through\r\nwhich you have been forc'd to run, like the Fountain _Arethusa_ through\r\nthe River _Alpheus_ without commixture of their waters. None having more\r\nconstantly retained his vertue then your Majesty, nor guarded it with more\r\ncaution.\r\n\r\nAnd now in all this height of glory, you receive all Men with so much\r\nhumility, that the difference of your change seems to be only this; that\r\nyou are now beloved of more, and love more, treating every man, as if\r\nevery man were your proper care, and as becomes the Father of so great a\r\nFamily; Sometimes you are pleased to lay more aside the beams of Majesty,\r\nthat you may descend to do mutual offices of Friendship; as considering\r\nthat these Virtues were not concredited to you by God, for your self only,\r\nbut for others also: In short, you are so perfect a Prince, that those who\r\ncome after you, will fear to be compared to you, _Experti quam sit\r\nonerosum succedere bono Principi_; since to possess your Virtues, they\r\nmust support your sufferings; nor can every head know how to sustain the\r\nweight of such a Crown as yours, where the thornes have so long perplext\r\nthe Lillies and the Roses of it.\r\n\r\nI might here mention Your Heroic and masculine Spirit in dangers, and yet\r\nYour foresight of them; Your tenderness to compassionate, Your Constancie\r\nin suffering, Your Modestie in Prosperitie, Equalitie in Adversitie, and\r\nthat sweetness of access which attracts both love and veneration from all\r\nthat converse with You; but these have already adorn'd your Character by\r\nthat excellent Hand who did lately describe it. [SN: _Col. Tuke._]\r\n\r\nYou are frequent at Councels, Patient in hearing, pertinent in answering,\r\njudicious in Determining, and so skilfull in the several Languages, that\r\nYou many times transact by Your self, what others do by Interpreters;\r\naffecting rather expedition in Your affairs, then insignificant State,\r\nwhich these acquired parts of Your Majesties do yet augment so much the\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nYou are curious of brave and Laudable things; You love shipping,\r\nBuildings, Gardens (having exceeded _Cyrus_ already in Your Plantations)\r\nPiscinas, Statues, Pictures, Intaglias, Music: You have already amass'd\r\nvery many rare collections of all kinds, and there is nothing worthy and\r\ngreat which can escape Your research.\r\n\r\nNor must I here forget the honour You have done our _Society_ at _Greshham\r\nColledge_ by Your curious enquiries about the _Load-Stone_, and other\r\nparticulars which concern _Philosophy_; since it is not to be doubted but\r\nthat{8} so Magnanimous a Prince, will still proceed to encourage that\r\nIllustrious Assembly; and which will celebrate and eternize Your memory to\r\nthe future Ages, beyond Your Majesties Predecessors, and indeed all the\r\nMonarchs on the Earth, when for You is reserv'd the being Founder of some\r\nthing that may improve practical and Experimental knowledg, beyond all\r\nthat has been hitherto attempted, for the Augmentation of Science, and\r\nuniversal good of Man-kind, and which alone will consummate Your Fame and\r\nrender it immortal.\r\n\r\nWhat shall I superadd to all these? That You rise early, that You are\r\nalwaies employ'd, that You love Hunting, Riding, swimming, manly Robust\r\nand Princely Exercises, not so much for delight, as health and relaxation.\r\n_Et vitæ pars nulla perit._\r\n\r\nO best Idea of Princes, sit to me yet one moment, that I may add this last\r\ntouch to Your fair Table; nor wonder that I should attempt so bold an\r\nenterprise; since he that would take the height of _Olympus_, must stand\r\nbelow in the plain: Subjects can best describe their Princes Virtues;\r\nPrinces best know their Subjects, and therefore most fit to rule them. And\r\nlong may You live to rule us great Sir. We wish that all you do, or may\r\ndo, be propitious to you, to us, to the public; or in a word, to your\r\n_M_ajesty alone, in which both we and the public are mutually concern'd.\r\nTime was (and too long alas it was!) that what was fortunate to the\r\nTyrant, was unhappy to your Subjects: now they are common to both and\r\nreciprocal; nor can we more be happy without you, then you without us; and\r\ntruly all Princes have known, that they are seldom beloved of God, who are\r\nhated of their People; nor can they be long secure. _Vox Populi, vox Dei\r\nest._ But you have seen the Effects of our Prayers against an Usurper;\r\nhear now, O Heaven our Vowes for a just Prince. Not for peace, not for\r\nRiches, not Honours, or new conquests do we supplicate; but for all these\r\nin one, The Safety of _CHARLES_. You alone snatch'd him out of those cruel\r\nhands, now preserve him from them: Render him fortunate to us, to our\r\nChildren, succeeding Generations give him a late Successor, and when You\r\ndo it, let it be such a one as himself.\r\n\r\nLet your Majestie now proceed in his Triumph, and hear the Acclamations of\r\nhis people; what can they more expresse who are ready to pave the very\r\nstreets with their bodies, in testimonie of their zeal? behold all about\r\nYou, the Gratulating old Fathers, the exulting Youths, the glad mothers;\r\nAnd why should it not be so? Here's no goods publicated, none restrain'd\r\nor mulcted of their Libertie, none diminish'd of dignitie, none molested,\r\nor exil'd; all are again return'd into{9} their houses, Relations and\r\nProperties, and which is yet more then all, to their antient\r\ninnocencie{10} and mutual charitie.\r\n\r\nIf the _Philosopher_ in the _Ethicks_ enquiring whether the felicity of\r\nthe sun, do any whit concern the happinesse of the defunct progenitor,\r\nafter much reasoning have determin'd that the honour only which his son\r\nacquires by worthie and great actions, does certainly refresh his Ghost:\r\nWhat a day of Jubilee, is this then to Your blessed Father! Not the odor\r\nof those flowers did so recreate the dead _Archemorus_ which the _Nymphs_\r\nwere yearly wont to strow upon his watry Sepulcher, as this daies\r\nInauguration of Yours, does even seem to revive the Ashes of that sacred\r\n_Martyr_.\r\n\r\nShould some one from the clouds that had looked down on the sad face of\r\nthings, when our Temples lay in dust, our Palaces in desolation, and the\r\nAltars demolished; when these Citie Gates were dashed to pieces, Gibbets\r\nand Executions erected in every Street, and all things turned into\r\nuniversal silence and solitude, behold now the change of this daies\r\nglorious scean; that we see the Churches in repair, the sacred Assemblies\r\nopen'd, our Cities re-edified, the Markets full of People, our Palaces\r\nrichly furnished, and the Streets proud with the burden of their Triumphal\r\nArches, and the shouts of a rejoycing multitude: How would he wonder and\r\nstand amaz'd, at the Prodigie, and leap down from his lofty station,\r\nthough already so near to heaven, to joyne with us in earth, participate\r\nof our felicitie, and ravish'd with the Ecstasie, cry out aloud now with\r\nUs.\r\n\r\nSet open the Temple-Gates, let the Prisoners go free, the Altars smoak\r\nperfumes, bring forth the Pretious things, strow the Waies with Flowers,\r\nlet the Fountains run Wine, Crown the Gobblets, bring Chapplets of Palmes\r\nand Lawrells, the Bells ring, the Trumpets sound, the Cannon roar, O happy\r\nDescent, and strange Reverse! I have seen{11} E_nglands_ Restorer, Great\r\n_CHARLES the II._ RETURN'D, REVENG'D, BELOV'D, CROWN'D, RE-ESTABLISH'D.\r\n\r\n    _Terrasque Astræa Revisit._\r\n\r\nAnd O that it were now in my power to speak some great thing, worthy this\r\ngreat day; I should put all the flowers of _Orators_ and Raptures of\r\n_Poets_ into one lofty & high Expression, and yet not Reach what I would\r\nsay to Your Majestie: For never since there was a Citie, or Kingdom, did a\r\nDay appear more glorious to _England_, never since it was a Nation, and in\r\nwhich there either was, or ought to be so universal a Jubilation: Not that\r\nYour Triumphal Charriots do drag the miserable Captives, but are\r\naccompanied by freed Citizens; perfidie is now vanquished, popular fury\r\nchayn'd, crueltie tam'd, luxury restrained, these lie under the spondells\r\nof Your Wheeles, where Empire, Faith, Love, and Justice Ride Triumphant,\r\nand nothing can be added to Your _M_a_j_esties glory but its perpetuitie.\r\nBut whence, alas! should I have this confidence, after so many _Elogies_\r\nand _Panegyricks_ of great and Eloquent men, who consecrate the memorie of\r\nthis daies happinesse; and (were the subject, like that of all other\r\nthings) would have left me nothing more to add, unless he who was\r\nsometimes wont to employ his pen for Your _M_ajestie being absent, should\r\nnow be silent that you are present, and inflame me with a kind of new\r\nEnthusiasme: I find myself then compell'd out of a grateful sense of my\r\ndutie for the publick benefit, and if your _M_ajestie forbid not, or\r\nwithdraw your influence, who shall hinder, that even my slender voice\r\nshould not strive to be heard, in such an universall{12} consort, wherein\r\neverybody has a part, every one a share?\r\n\r\nPermit me therefore (O best of Kings) to present, and lay these my vowes\r\nat your sacred feet, to exsult, and to Rejoyce with the Rest of your Loyal\r\nSubjects; not as I desire, but as I am able, and as I would do it to God,\r\nand as he best loves it,\r\n\r\n    _Sentiendo copiosius, quam loquendo._\r\n\r\n_DIXI._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Andrews Clark Memorial Library: University of California\r\n\r\nTHE AUGUSTAN REPRINT SOCIETY\r\n\r\n_General Editors_\r\n\r\nH.
