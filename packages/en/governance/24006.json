Because last year, in the heart of the Sierras, I saw\r\nwomen and children chained together and marched down from their cool,\r\nhealthy homes to degradation and death on the Reservation. At the side\r\nof this long, chained line, urged on and kept in order by bayonets, rode\r\na young officer, splendid in gold and brass, and newly burnished, from\r\nthat now famous charity-school on the Hudson. These women and children\r\nwere guilty of no crime; they were not even accused of wrong. But their\r\nfathers and brothers lay dead in battle-harness, on the mountain\r\nheights and in the lava beds; and these few silent survivors, like\r\nIsrael of old, were being led into captivity--but, unlike the chosen\r\nchildren, never to return to the beloved heart of their mountains.\r\n\r\nDo you doubt these statements about the treatment of the Indians? Then\r\nread this, from the man--the fiend in the form of man--who for years,\r\nand until recently, had charge of all the Indians in the United States:\r\n\r\n    \"From reports and testimony before me, I find that Indians\r\n    removed to the Reservation or Indian Territory, die off so\r\n    rapidly that the race must soon become extinct if they are so\r\n    removed. _In this connection, I recommend the early removal of\r\n    all the Indians to the Indian Territory._\"\r\n\r\nThe above coarse attempt at second-hand wit is quoted from memory. But\r\nif the exact words are not given, the substance is there; and, indeed,\r\nthe idea and expression is not at all new.\r\n\r\nI know if you contemplate the Indian from the railroad platform, as you\r\ncross the plains, you will almost conclude, from the dreadful specimens\r\nthere seen, that the Indian Commissioner was not so widely out of the\r\nway in that brutal desire. But the real Indian is not there. The Special\r\nCorrespondent will not find him, though he travel ten thousand miles. He\r\nis in the mountains, a free man yet; not a beggar, not a thief, but the\r\nbrightest, bravest, truest man alive. Every few years, the soldiers find\r\nhim; and they do not despise him when found. Think of Captain Jack, with\r\nhis sixty braves, holding the whole army at bay for half a year! Think\r\nof Chief Joseph, to whose valor and virtues the brave and brilliant\r\nsoldiers sent to fight him bear immortal testimony. Seamed with scars of\r\nbattle, and bloody from the fight of the deadly day and the night\r\npreceding; his wife dying from a bullet; his boy lying dead at his feet;\r\nhis command decimated; bullets flying thick as hail; this Indian walked\r\nright into the camp of his enemy, gun in hand, and then--not like a\r\nbeaten man, not like a captive, but like a king--demanded to know the\r\nterms upon which his few remaining people could be allowed to live. When\r\na brave man beats a brave man in battle, he likes to treat him well--as\r\nwitness Grant and Lee; and so Generals Howard and Miles made fair terms\r\nwith the conquered chief. The action of the Government which followed\r\nmakes one sick at heart. Let us in charity call it _imbecility_. But\r\nbefore whose door shall we lay the dead? Months after the surrender,\r\nthis brave but now heart-broken chief, cried out:\r\n\r\n    \"Give my people water, or they will die. This is mud and slime\r\n    that we have to drink here on this Reservation. More than half\r\n    are dead already. Give us the water of our mountains. And will\r\n    you not give us back just one mountain too? There are not many\r\n    of us left now. We will not want much now. Give us back just one\r\n    mountain, so that these women and children may live. Take all\r\n    the valleys. But you cannot plow the mountains. Give us back\r\n    just one little mountain, with cool, clear water, and then these\r\n    children can live.\"\r\n\r\nAnd think of Standing Bear and his people, taken by fraud and force from\r\ntheir lands to the Indian Territory Reservation, and after the usual\r\nhardships and wrongs incident to such removals, with no hope from a\r\nGovernment which neither kept its promises nor listened to their\r\nappeals, setting out to try to get back to Omaha. Think of these men,\r\nstealing away in the night, leaving their little children, their wives\r\nand parents, prostrate, dying, destitute! They were told that they could\r\nnot leave--that they must stay there; that they would be followed and\r\nshot if they attempted to go away. They had no money; they had no food.\r\nThey were sick and faint. They were on foot, and but poorly clad. Yet\r\nthey struggled on through the snow day after day, week after week,\r\nleaving a bloody trail where they passed; leaving their dead in the snow\r\nwhere they passed. And this awful journey lasted for more than fifty\r\ndays! And what happened to these poor Indians after that fearful\r\njourney? They did not go to the white man for help. They did not go back\r\nto their old homes. They troubled no one. They went to a neighboring\r\nfriendly tribe. This tribe gave them a little land, and they instantly\r\nwent to work to make homes and prepare a place for the few of their\r\nnumber still alive whom they had left behind. Then came the order from\r\nWashington, and the Chief was arrested while plowing in the field. In a\r\nspeech made by him after the arrest, and when he was about to be taken\r\nback, the Chief said:\r\n\r\n    \"I wanted to go back to my old place north. I wanted to save\r\n    myself and my tribe. I built a good stable. I raised cattle and\r\n    hogs and all kinds of stock. I broke land. All these things I\r\n    lost by some bad man. Any one knows to take a man from a cold\r\n    climate and put him in the hot sun, down in the south, it would\r\n    kill him. We refused to go down there. We afterwards went down\r\n    to see our friends, and see how they liked it. Brothers, I come\r\n    home now. I took my brothers and friends and came back here. We\r\n    went to work. I had hold of the handles of my plow. Eight days\r\n    ago I was at work on my farm, which the Omahas gave me. I had\r\n    sowed some spring wheat, and wished to sow some more. I was\r\n    living peaceably with all men. I have never committed any crime.\r\n    I was arrested and brought back as a prisoner. Does your law do\r\n    that? I have been told, since the great war all men were free\r\n    men, and that no man can be made a prisoner unless he does\r\n    wrong. I have done no wrong, and yet I am here a prisoner. Have\r\n    you a law for white men, and a different law for those who are\r\n    not white?\r\n\r\n    \"I have been going around for three years. I have lost all my\r\n    property. My constant thought is, 'What man has done this?' Of\r\n    course I know I cannot say 'no.' Whatever they say I must do, I\r\n    must do it. I know you have an order to send me to the Indian\r\n    Territory, and we must obey it.\"\r\n\r\nAfterwards, speaking of the terrible days at the Reservation, this\r\nIndian said to an officer:\r\n\r\n    \"We counted our dead for awhile, but when all my children and\r\n    half the tribe were dead, we did not take any notice of anything\r\n    much. When my son was dying, he begged me to take his bones back\r\n    to the old home, if ever I got away. In that little box are the\r\n    bones of my son; I have tried to take them back to be buried\r\n    with our fathers.\"\r\n\r\nI may here add, that in the meantime the brother of this Indian, who was\r\nleft in charge of the tribe, was accused of trying to get away also. He\r\nprotested his innocence, but the agent had him arrested and brought\r\nbefore him. Then he ordered him to be ironed. The proud, free savage\r\nbegged not to be put in irons, but the brutal agent persisted. The\r\nIndian resisted, _and was shot dead on the spot_.\r\n\r\nThink of the Cheyennes last year. They, too, had tried to escape from\r\nthe Reservation, and reach their homes through the deep snow. This was\r\ntheir only offense. No man had ever accused them of any other crime than\r\nthis love of their native haunts, this longing for home. They were dying\r\nthere on the Reservation; more than half had already died. And now, when\r\ntaken, they refused to go back. The officer attempted to starve them\r\ninto submission. They were shut up in a pen without food, naked,\r\nstarving, the snow whistling through the pen, children freezing to death\r\nin their mother's arms! But they would not submit. Knowing now that they\r\nmust die, they determined to die in action rather than freeze and\r\nstarve, like beasts in a pen. At a concerted signal, they attempted to\r\nbreak through the soldiers and reach the open plain. An old man was\r\ncarried on the back of his tottering son; a mounted soldier pursued\r\nthem, and hacked father and son to pieces with the same sabre-cuts. A\r\nmother was seen flying over the snow with two children clinging about\r\nher neck. The wretched savages separated and ran in all directions. But\r\nthe mounted men cut them down in the snow. No one asked, or even would\r\naccept, quarter. They fought with sticks, stones, fists, their teeth,\r\nlike wild beasts. They wanted to die. One little group escaped to a\r\nravine. There they were found killing each other with a sort of knife\r\nmade from an old piece of hoop.\r\n\r\nAnd yet you believe man-hunting is over in America!\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to write with composure or evenness on this subject.\r\nOne wants to rise up and crush things.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned two tribes near at hand, whose histories are not\r\nunfamiliar to the public ear. But what if I should recite the wrongs of\r\ntribes far away--far beyond the Rocky Mountains--where the Indian Agent\r\nhas to answer to no one? You would not believe one-tenth part told you.\r\nThe terrible stories of the Cheyennes and the Poncas are very mild\r\nchapters in the history of our Indian policy.\r\n\r\nUnder the stars and stripes, these scenes are repeated year after year;\r\nand they will be continued until they are made impossible by the\r\ncivilization and sense of justice which righted that other though far\r\nless terrible wrong.\r\n\r\nAs that greatest man has said, \"We are making history in America.\" This\r\nis a conspicuous fact, that no one who would be remembered in this\r\ncentury should forget. We are making dreadful history, dreadfully fast.\r\nHow terrible it will all read when the writer and reader of these lines\r\nare long since forgotten! Ages may roll by. We may build a city over\r\nevery dead tribe's bones. We may bury the last Indian deep as the\r\neternal gulf. But these records will remain, and will rise up in\r\ntestimony against us to the last day of our race.\r\n\r\n    J. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nMOUNT SHASTA.\r\n\r\n    _To lord all Godland! lift the brow\r\n    Familiar to the moon, to top\r\n    The universal world, to prop\r\n    The hollow heavens up, to vow\r\n    Stern constancy with stars, to keep\r\n    Eternal watch while eons sleep;\r\n    To tower proudly up and touch\r\n    God's purple garment-hems that sweep\r\n    The cold blue north! Oh, this were much!_\r\n\r\n    _Where storm-born shadows hide and hunt\r\n    I knew thee, in thy glorious youth,\r\n    And loved thy vast face, white as truth;\r\n    I stood where thunderbolts were wont\r\n    To smite thy Titan-fashioned front,\r\n    And heard dark mountains rock and roll;\r\n    I saw the lightning's gleaming rod\r\n    Reach forth and write on heaven's scroll\r\n    The awful autograph of God!_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd what a mighty heart these Sierras have! Kissing the purple of heaven\r\nnow, and now in their awful deeps hiding the shrinking form of darkness\r\nfrom the sun.\r\n\r\nThe shaggy monsters that prowl there, the mountains of gold that lie\r\nwaiting there, the mystery and the splendor! Oh keep with me, my friend,\r\nfor a little while in the Sierras; breathe their balm and health, see\r\ntheir sublimity, feel their might and their majesty; step upward, as on\r\nstepping stairs to heaven; and my word for it, you will be none the\r\nworse.\r\n\r\nIn a canyon here, deep, deep, away down in the darkness, where night\r\nseems to have an abiding place, where the sun sifts through the\r\npine-tops timidly, where the loftiest trees tip-toe up and seem to\r\nstrive to reach out of the edge of the chasm, there gurgles a little\r\nmuddy stream among the boulders, about the miners' legs, as they bend\r\ntheir backs wearily and toil for gold.\r\n\r\nHere the smoke curls up from a low log cabin; there a squirrel barks a\r\nnut on the roof of a ruined and deserted miner's home, and away up\r\nyonder, where the deep gorge is so narrow you can almost leap across it,\r\nthe wild beasts prowl as if it were really night, and great owls beat\r\ntheir wings against the boughs of the dense wood in everlasting\r\ndarkness. But high over gorge and wilderness, gleaming against the cold\r\nblue sky, towers Mount Shasta, the monarch of the Sierras.\r\n\r\nHere, where the canyon debouches into the little valley, once stood a\r\npopulous mining camp; and a little further on, where the sun fell in\r\nfull splendor, a few farms of a primitive kind, tended by broken-down\r\nold miners, lay.\r\n\r\nThe old glory of the camp was gone, and only a few battered and crippled\r\nmen were left. It was as if there had been a great battle of the giants,\r\nand the victorious and successful had gone away with all the fruits of\r\nvictory, and left the wounded, the helpless, the half-hearted behind.\r\nThe mining camp at the mouth of the great canyon had been worked out, so\r\nfar as the placer mines went, and these few broken men who remained, as\r\na rule, were turning their attention to other things. Here one had\r\nplanted a little garden on the hillside, on a spot that had once been a\r\ngraveyard. There, an old lawyer had grown grape-vines all over and about\r\nthe door and chimney of his cabin, till men said it looked like a\r\nspider-web.\r\n\r\nBut old Forty-nine only bored deeper and deeper into the spur of the\r\nmountain, and paid but little attention to any of the changes that went\r\non around him. He had been working in that tunnel alone for nearly\r\ntwenty-five years. He was a man with a history--men said a murderer. He\r\nshunned men, and men shunned him. Was he rich? He professed to be very\r\npoor; men said he must be worth a million. Would a man work on\r\ntwenty-five years in one tunnel, and all alone, for nothing? But if\r\nrich, why did he remain?\r\n\r\nStill further down, and quite on the edge of the valley, stood another\r\ncabin. And this was quite overgrown with vines, and was quite hidden\r\naway in a growth of pines that gathered over it. Then there was an\r\nundergrowth of fruit trees that grew inside the fence and about the\r\nlonely porch. On this porch had sat, for years and years, a tawny,\r\nsilent old woman. She was sickly--had neither wealth, wit nor\r\nbeauty--and so, so far as the world went, was left quite alone.\r\n\r\nBut there was another and an all-sufficient reason why neither man or\r\nwoman came that way. She was an Indian. Do not imagine this a wild\r\nIndian woman. Indian she was; but remember, the Catholics had more than\r\nhalf civilized nearly all the native Californians long before we\r\nundertook to kill them.\r\n\r\nThis Indian woman would have been called by strangers a Mexican woman.\r\nShe was very religious, and had imbued her boy with all her beautiful\r\nfaith and simple piety.\r\n\r\nI know that the spectacle of an old Indian woman and her \"half-breed\"\r\nson, represented as the morality and religion of a camp made up of\r\n\"civilized\" Saxons, will seem somewhat novel to you. But I knew this\r\nIndian boy and his mother well, and know every foot of the ground I\r\nintend to go over, and every fact I propose to narrate. And if you are\r\nnot prepared to receive this as truth, I prefer you to close this page\r\nright here.\r\n\r\nTo make a moment's digression, with your permission, let me state\r\nbriefly and frankly, once for all, that the only really religious,\r\nunquestioning and absolutely devout Christians I ever met in America are\r\nthe Indians. I know of no other people so faithful and so blindly true\r\nto their belief, outside of the peasantry of Italy. Be their beautiful\r\nfaith born of ignorance or what, I do not say. I simply assert that it\r\nexists. There is no devotion so true as that of a converted Indian.\r\nMaybe it is the devotion of idolatry, the faith of superstition. But I\r\nrepeat, it is sincere. And let me further say, it seems to me whatever\r\nis worth believing at all, is worth believing utterly and entirely--just\r\nas these simple children of the wilderness believe, without doubt or\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nI know nothing so beautiful--may I say picturesque?--as the Ummatilla\r\nIndians of Oregon at worship on Sunday. Not a man, woman or child of all\r\nthe tribe absent. Not one voice silent when the hymns are given out, in\r\nall that vast, gaily colored and singular assemblage.\r\n\r\nThis is the tribe of which the white settlers asked and received\r\nprotection last year when the Shoshonees ravaged the country, beat off\r\nthe soldiers, and slew some of the settlers. And yet there is a bill\r\nbefore Congress to-day to take away the few remaining acres from this\r\ntribe and open up the place to white settlers. Indeed, it seems that\r\nevery member of Congress from Oregon has just this one mission; for the\r\nfirst, and almost the only thing he does while there, is to introduce\r\nand urge the passage of this bill, whereby the red man is to be turned\r\nout of his well-tilled fields, and the white man turned into them.\r\n\r\nIn truth, these very fields have long been staked off and claimed by\r\nbold, bad white men, who hover about the borders of this Reservation,\r\nwaiting for the long-promised law which is to take this land from the\r\nowners and give it to them. They nominate their members of Congress on\r\nhis pledge and bond, and constant promise, to take this land from the\r\nIndian. They vote for and elect the only member of Congress from this\r\nState on that promise, certain that their absolute ownership of this\r\ngraveyard of the Indian is only a question of time. Year by year the\r\ngraveyard grows broader; the fields grow narrower; they grow less in\r\nnumber; for now and then an Indian is found wandering away from the\r\nReservation to his former hunting-grounds and ancient graves of his\r\nfathers. He seldom comes back. Sometimes his murderers trouble\r\nthemselves to throw the body in the brush or some gorge or canyon. But\r\nmost frequently it is left where it falls. To say that all the people or\r\nthe best people of this brave young State approve of this, would be\r\nunfair--untrue. Yet this does not save the Indian, who is doing his best\r\nto fit into the new order of things around him. He is shot down, and\r\nneither grand or petit jury can be found to punish his murderer.\r\n\r\nBut to the story. This little piece of land where the old Indian woman\r\nhad lived and brought up her boy, was rich and valuable. It was\r\ntherefore coveted by the white man. At first men had said: \"She will die\r\nsoon; the boy will then sell the hut for a song, gamble off the money,\r\nand then go the way of all who are stained with the dark and tawny blood\r\nof the savage--death in a ditch from some unknown rifle, or death by the\r\nfever in the new Reservation.\" But the old woman still lived on; and the\r\nboy, by his industry, sobriety, duty and devotion to his mother, put to\r\nshame the very best among the new generation of white men in the\r\nmountains. The singular manhood of John Logan was the subject of remark\r\nby all who knew him. With the few true men on this savage edge of the\r\nworld it made him fast friends; with the many outlaws and evil natures\r\nit made him the subject of envy and bitter hatred.\r\n\r\nWhat power behind this boy had lifted him up and led him on? Surely no\r\nIndian woman, wholly unlettered in the ways of the white man, good and\r\ntrue as she may have been, had brought him up to this high place on\r\nwhich he now stood. Who was his father? and what strong hand had reached\r\nout all these years and kept his mother there in that little hut with\r\nher boy, while her tribe perished or passed away to the hated and\r\nhorrible Reservation down toward the sea?\r\n\r\nWho was his father? The Camp had asked this a thousand times. The boy\r\nhimself had looked into the deep, pathetic eyes of his mother, and asked\r\nthe question in his heart for many and many a year; but he never opened\r\nhis lips to ask her. It was too sad, too sacred a subject, and he would\r\nnot ask of her what she would not freely give. And now she lay dying\r\nthere alone on the porch, as her boy stopped to talk with the two\r\nchildren, \"the babes in the wood,\" and her secret hidden in her own\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nAnd who were the \"babes in the wood?\" Little waifs, fugitives, hiding\r\nfrom the man-hunters. As a rule in early days, when the settlers killed\r\noff the adult Indians in their forays, they took the children and\r\nbrought them up in slavery. But the girl--the eldest, stronger and\r\nlither of these two dark little creatures--darting, hiding, stealing\r\nabout this ruined old camp, was so wild and spirited, even from the\r\nfirst, that no one wanted her. And then she was dangerously bright, and\r\nabove all, she did not quite look the Indian; men doubted if she really\r\nwere an Indian or no, sometimes. But I remember hearing old\r\nLeather-Nose, as he sat on a barrel one night in the grocery, and\r\nsquirted amber at the back-log, say: \"I guess, by gol, she's Injun:\r\nShe's devilish enough. She don't look the Injun, I know; but its the\r\ncussedness that makes me know she's Injun.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when did she come to the camp?\" asked a respectable stranger.\r\n\r\n\"Don't know. That's it. Nobody don't know, and nobody don't care, I\r\nguess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't you know where she came from? Children don't come down, you\r\nknow, like rain or snow. There were about fifty little children left in\r\nthe Mountain-meadow massacre. They are somewhere. These may be some of\r\nthem. Don't you know who brought them here, or how they came?\" asked the\r\nhonest stranger, leaning forward and looking into the faces of the\r\nwrinkled and hairy old miners.\r\n\r\nAn old miner turned his quid again and again, and at last feeling scant\r\ninterest in the ragged little sister who led her little brother about by\r\nthe hand, and stood between him and peril as she kept their\r\nliberty--drily answered, along with his fellows, as follows: \"Some said\r\nan old Indian that died had her; but I don't know. Forty-nine knows most\r\nabout her. When he's short of grub, and that's pretty often now, I\r\nguess, why she has to do the best she can.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, it was a sick looking thing at first. Why, it wasn't that high, and\r\nwas all hair and bones,\" growled out an old gray miner, in reply to the\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and don't you know when we called it the 'baby,' and it used to\r\nbeg around about the cabins? The poor little barefooted brat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and when the 'baby' nearly starved, and eat some raw turnips that\r\nmade it sick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and got the colic--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and Gambler Jake got on his mule and started for the doctor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, an' got in a poker game at Mariposa, and didn't get back for four\r\ndays.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and the doctor didn't come; and so the baby got well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, just so, just so.\" And old Col. Billy bobbed his head, and fell to\r\nthinking of other days.\r\n\r\nThis little piece of land where the old Indian woman had lived so long,\r\nand about which she had built a fence, was very valuable indeed. Valley\r\nland was scarce here in the mountains; and there was a young orchard,\r\nthe only thing of the kind in the country. And then the roads forked\r\nthere, and two little rivers ran together there, and that meant that a\r\ntown would spring up there as the country became settled, farms opened,\r\nand the Indians were swept away. Evil-minded men are never without\r\nresources. The laws are made to restrain such men; but on the border\r\nthere is no law enforced. So you see how powerful are the wicked there;\r\nhow powerless the weak, though never so well disposed.\r\n\r\nIn the far West, if an Indian is in your way, you have only to report\r\nhim to the Agent of the Indian Reservation. That is all you have to do.\r\nHe disappears, or dies. This Indian Agent is only too anxious to fill up\r\nhis wasting ranks of Indians. They are dying every day. And if they all\r\nshould die, sooner or later the fact may be known at Washington, and in\r\nthe course of a few years the Reservation and office would be abolished\r\ntogether. And then each additional Indian contributes greatly to the\r\nAgent's income, for each Indian must be fed and clothed--or at least,\r\nthe Agent is permitted to draw clothing, blankets and food for every\r\nIndian brought upon the Reservation. As to the Indians receiving these\r\nthings, that is quite another affair.\r\n\r\nWell, here were men wanting this land. Down yonder, far away to the\r\nscorching South, at the edge of the level alkali lands, in a tule swamp,\r\nwhere the Indians taken from the mountains were penned up and dying like\r\nsheep in a corral, was a bold, enterprising Indian Agent who was\r\ngathering in, under orders of his Government, all the Indians of\r\nNorthern California. He could appoint a hundred deputies, and authorize\r\nthem to bring in the Indians wherever found.\r\n\r\nThe two children--\"the babes in the wood\"--had been taken to the\r\nReservation; but being bold and active, they contrived to soon escape\r\nand return to the mountains. Men whispered that the girl owed her escape\r\nto the great and growing favor in which she was held by one of the\r\ndeputy agents, who, with his partner, a rough and coarse-grained man,\r\nhad their homes in this camp. The cabin of these two deputy agents,\r\nDosson and Emens, stood not far from that of old Forty-Nine. But so far\r\nas I can remember, the old man and the newly appointed deputy agents had\r\nalways been at enmity.\r\n\r\nThis Dosson was certainly a bad man. He was in every sense of the word a\r\ndesperado, and so was his partner; just the men most wanted by the head\r\nagent at the Reservation to capture and bring in Indians.\r\n\r\nBut whether this girl owed her escape or not to this ruffian, Dosson,\r\ncertain it is that on her return she avoided his cabin, and when not in\r\nthe woods, hovered about that of old Forty-Nine. This enraged Dosson\r\nbeyond degree. To add to his anger, she now began to show a particular\r\npreference for John Logan. The idea of having an Indian for a rival was\r\nmore than this ignorant and brutal Deputy Agent could well bear, and he\r\nset to work at once to rid himself of the object of his hatred.\r\n\r\nThe hard and merciless man-hunter almost shouted with delight at a new\r\nidea which now came upon him with the light and suddeness of a\r\nrevelation. He ran at once to his partner, and told him of his\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\nThen these two men sat down and talked a long time together. They made\r\nmarks in the sand with sticks. They set up little stakes in the sand,\r\nand seemed delighted as they reached their heads out and looked down\r\nfrom the mouth of their tunnel toward the Indian farm.\r\n\r\nThat night these two men stole down together, and set up stakes and made\r\ncorner marks about John Logan's land while he slept, and then rolled\r\nthemselves in their blankets, and spent the night inside the limits of\r\ntheir new location. Having done this, and sent a notice of their\r\npre-emption to the Surveyor General, to be filed as their declaration of\r\nclaim to the little farm with the orchard, they entered complaint\r\nagainst John Logan, and so sat down to await results.\r\n\r\nMeantime, this old woman sat alone, with a great dog by her side, sick\r\nand desolate, waiting her sun of life to set, piously waiting, dark\r\nbrowed, thoughtful; while her tall handsome boy, meek, obedient, with\r\nthe awful curse of Cain upon his brow, the mark of Indian blood, was\r\ntoiling on up in the canyon alone.\r\n\r\nYou had better be a negro--you had better be ten times a negro, were it\r\npossible--than be one-tenth part an Indian in the West. The Indian will\r\nhave little to do with one who is part Indian. And as for the white man,\r\nunless the Indian is willing to be his slave, do him homage and service,\r\nhe would sooner take a leper in his house or to his heart.\r\n\r\nUp and above the Indian woman's house, in the dense wood and on the spur\r\nof the mountain, wound an old Indian trail. Along this trail, above the\r\nhidden house, stole two little creatures--tawny, sunburnt, ragged,\r\nwretched, yet full of affection for each other. These were the two\r\nwretched children escaped from the Reservation. They were now being\r\nharbored by old Forty-nine. For this he was liable to be arrested and\r\npunished. Knowing this, he kept his gun loaded and standing in the\r\ncorner of his cabin, where the children slept at night.\r\n\r\nHow strange that this one man, the most despised and miserable, should\r\nbe the only one to reach a hand to help these little waifs of the woods!\r\nAnd who knew or who cared from where they came? They did not look the\r\nIndian, though they acted it to perfection. They would run away and hide\r\nfrom the face of man. Yet the girl, under the passionate California sun,\r\nwas almost blossoming into womanhood. They were called brother and\r\nsister. God knows if they were or no. Break up tribes, families, as\r\nthese had been broken up--fire into a flock of young quails all day--and\r\nwho knows how soon or where the few that escape may gather together\r\nagain, or if they will know each other when they meet, years after in\r\nthe woods?\r\n\r\nChildren are so impressionable. They had heard some one in the camp call\r\nthe old Indian woman who sat forever on the porch in the dense foliage,\r\nwith the big dog beside her, a witch. They did not know what that\r\nmeant. But they knew it was something dreadful, and they shunned and\r\nabhorred her accordingly. Yet the girl knew John Logan, her tall\r\nhandsome son, well, and liked him, too.\r\n\r\nAs they stole along the dim old Indian trail, their necks were stretched\r\ntoward the old Indian woman's hut below. They were as noiseless as two\r\npanthers. At last the girl stopped, stood still, pointed and half pushed\r\nthe boy before and in through the thicket, past an occasional lonely\r\ncabin, toward the widow's woody home.\r\n\r\nThis old woman had long been ailing. She was now very ill. You are\r\nsurprised to learn of sickness in the heart of the Sierras? I tell you\r\nthat if you were to wash down mountains and uproot forests in the\r\nmoon--were such a thing possible--the ague would seize hold of you\r\nand shake you for it. Nature is revengeful. But to return to the\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nWhat a wilderness this was! Only here and there, at long intervals, a\r\nlittle cabin down in the deep, dense wood; these cabins scattered as if\r\nthe hand of some mighty sower had reached out over the wilderness, and\r\nhad sown and strown them there, to take root and grow to some great\r\nharvest of civilization. The narrow Indian trail wound along, almost\r\nentirely hidden by overhanging woods--a trail that turned and twisted at\r\nevery little obstacle; here it was the prostrate form of some patriarch\r\ntree, or here it curved and cork-screwed in and out through mighty\r\nforest-kings, that stood like comrades in ranks of battle.\r\n\r\nWhere did this little Indian trail lead to? Where did it begin? How many\r\na love-tale had been told in the shadow of those mighty trees that\r\nreached their long, strong arms out over the heads of all passers-by, in\r\na sort of priestly benediction?\r\n\r\nWhere did the Indian trail lead to? To the West. But leaves were strewn\r\nthick along it now. The Indian had gone, to come back no more. Ever to\r\nthe West points the Indian's path. Ever down to the great gold shore of\r\nthe vast west sea leads the Indian's path. And there the waves sweep in\r\nand obliterate his foot-prints forever.\r\n\r\nThe two half-wild children who had disappeared down the dim trail a few\r\nmoments before, now suddenly re-appear. They are eager and excited.\r\nThis boy cannot be above ten years old; yet he looks old as a man. The\r\ngirl may be twelve, fifteen, or even sixteen. Age at such a period is a\r\nmatter of either blood or climate. She has a shock of unkempt hair; she\r\nwears a tattered dress of as many colors as Jacob's coat. She has one\r\ntoeless boot on one foot; on the other she wears a shoe so big that it\r\nmight hold both her feet. Down over this shoe rolls a large red woolen\r\nstocking, leaving her shapely little ankle bleeding from\r\nbrier-scratches. In her hand she swings a large, coarse straw hat by its\r\nbroad red ribbons. Her every limb is full of force and fire; her voice\r\nis firm and resolute, but not rapid. Hers is a splendid energy, needing\r\nbut proper direction.\r\n\r\nHer brother, who puffs and pants at her side, is named Johnny; but the\r\nwild West, which has a habit of naming things because they look it, has\r\ndubbed him \"Stumps,\" since he is short and fat. He is half-clad in a\r\npair of tattered pants, a great straw hat, and a full, stuffy, check\r\nshirt, which is held in subjection by a pair of hand-made woolen\r\nsuspenders--the work of his sister.\r\n\r\nBoth are out of breath--both are looking back wildly; but Stumps huddles\r\nup again and again close under his sister's arm, as if he fears he might\r\nbe followed, and looks to her for protection. She draws him close to\r\nher, and then looking back, and then down into his upturned face, says\r\nbreathlessly:\r\n\r\n\"Stumps! Oh, Stumps, did you get 'em, Stumps?\"\r\n\r\nThe boy shrinks closer to his sister, and again looking back, and then\r\nseeing for a certainty that he is not followed, he grows bolder and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"Git 'em, Carats? Look there! And that 'un is your'n, Carats; and you\r\ncan have both of 'em if you want 'em, for I don't feel hungry now,\r\nCarats,\" and here he hitches up his pants, and wipes his nose on his\r\nsleeve.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Stumps, don't you feel hungry now?\" Then suddenly beholding two\r\nupheld ruddy peaches, she catches her breath, and says: \"Oh, oh!\" and\r\nshe starts back and throws up her hands. \"Oh, the pretty, pretty\r\npeaches!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, take 'em both, Carrie--I ain't hungry now.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't want but one, Stumps--one 's enough. Why, how you tore your\r\npants; and your shin 's a bleeding, too. Why, poor Stumps!\"\r\n\r\nStumps, looking back, cries:\r\n\r\n\"Shoo! Thar war a dog--yes, thar war a dog! And what do you think! Shoo!\r\nI thought I heard somethin' a comin'. Carats, old Miss Logan, the Injun\r\nwoman, seed me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Stumps! No?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she did. When I clim' the fence, and slid down that sapling in the\r\nyard, there she laid on the porch on her shuck-bed a-shaking with the\r\nager. And, Carats, she was a-looking right straight at me--yes, she was;\r\nso help me, she was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Stumps; and what did she do! Didn't she holler, and say 'Seek 'em,\r\nBose?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Carats, she didn't; and that's what's the matter--and that's why I\r\ndon't want to eat any peaches, Carats. Carats, I wish she had--I do, I\r\ndo, so help me. Let's not eat 'em--let's take 'em back--Carrie, sister\r\nCarrie, let's take 'em back.\"\r\n\r\nCarrie thoughtfully and tenderly gazes in his face.\r\n\r\n\"Let's take 'em to old Forty-nine, Johnny. There ain't nothing he can\r\neat, you know; an' then he's been a-shakin' since melon-time,--an'\r\nJohnny, I don't think we are very good to him, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nStumps, scratching his bleeding shin with his foot, exclaims:\r\n\r\n\"I've barked my shin, and I've tore'd my pants, an' I don't care! But I\r\nwon't take him a peach that I've stoled. Why, what would he think,\r\nCarats? He'd die dead, he would, if he thought I'd stoled them peaches\r\nfrom the poor old sick Injun woman; yes he would, Carats.\"\r\n\r\n\"Johnny, I'll tell him we found 'em,\" as Stumps looks doubtingly at her,\r\n\"tell him we found 'em in a tree, Stumps. Yes tell him we found 'em away\r\nup in the top of a cedar tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't want to tell no lie, nor do nothin' bad no more, and I want\r\nto go home, I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Stumps--Johnny, brother Johnny, what will we do with them? We\r\ncan't stand here all day. I want to go home, too. Oh, this hateful,\r\nhateful peach! I want to go right off!\" and the girl, hiding her face\r\nin her hands, begins to weep.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sister Carrie--sister, don't, don't; sister, don't, don't!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let's eat 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't like peaches.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't like peaches either!\" cries Carrie, throwing back her hair,\r\nwiping her eyes, and trying to be bright and cheerful. \"I never could\r\neat peaches. I like pine-nuts, and cowcumbers, and tomatuses,\r\nand--pine-nuts. Oh, I'm very fond of pine-nuts. I like pine-nuts\r\nroasted, and tomatuses, an' I like chestnuts raw, an' tomatuses. Don't\r\nyou like pine-nuts and tomatuses, Johnny, and cowcumbers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't like nothin' any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, Johnny, take 'em back.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I--I take 'em back by myself? I take 'em back, an' hear old Bose\r\ngrowl, and look into her holler eyes?\" Here the boy shudders, and\r\nlooking around timidly, he creeps closer to his sister and says, as he\r\nagain gazes back in the direction of the Indian woman's cabin: \"I'd be\r\nafraid she might be dead, Carats, an' there'd be nobody to hold the\r\ndog. Oh, I see her holler eyes looking at me all the time. If she'd\r\nonly let the dog come. Confound her! If she'd only let the dog come!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Johnny, Johnny--brother Johnny, come, lets go home! Shoo! There's\r\nsomebody coming. It's John Logan, coming home from his work.\"\r\n\r\nAs the girl speaks, John Logan, the sick woman's son, a strong handsome\r\nman, only brown as if browned by the sun, with a pick on his shoulder\r\nand a gold-pan slanting under his arm, comes whistling along the trail.\r\nSeeing the children, he stops and says:\r\n\r\n\"Why, children, good evening! What are you running away for? Come, come\r\nnow, don't be so shy, my little neighbors, and don't give the trail all\r\nto me because I happen to be a man, and the strongest. Come, Johnny,\r\ngive me your hand. There! an honest, chubby little fist it is. Why, what\r\nhave you got in your other hand? Been gathering nuts, hey? You little\r\nsquirrel! Give me a nut, won't you.\"\r\n\r\nCarrie approaches, dives her hand into her ragged pocket and reaches the\r\nman a heaped handful of nuts.\r\n\r\n\"There, if you'll have nuts I'll bring you nuts; I'll bring you lots of\r\nnuts, I will; I'll bring you a bushel of nuts, an'--some tomatuses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you are too kind. But now I must hasten home to mother. Come, shake\r\nhands again, and say good-bye.\" The girl gives her left hand. \"No your\r\nright hand.\"\r\n\r\nCarrie is bothered, and slips the peach in her left hand behind, and,\r\nwith a lifted face, full of glow and enthusiasm, says:\r\n\r\n\"I'll bring you a whole bag full of nuts, I will,\" and she reaches him\r\nher hand eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh Carrie, I have a nice little surprise for you, and if you won't tell\r\nI'll let you into the secret. You won't tell?\"\r\n\r\nHe comes close to her, sits down his gold-pan, and resting his pick on\r\nthe ground, with his two hands on the top of the handle, leans toward\r\nher and looks into her innocent uplifted face.\r\n\r\nThe girl's eyes brighten, and she seems to grow tall and beautiful under\r\nhis earnest gaze.\r\n\r\n\"I won't tell, sir. Oh, please to trust me, sir--I won't tell, Mr. John\r\nLogan!\"\r\n\r\nThe boy eagerly comes forward also.\r\n\r\n\"I won't tell, neither. I won't tell neither; so help me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, come close to me, Johnny, come close up here, and look in\r\nmy face--there! Why, I declare the pleasure I now have, telling you\r\nthis, is more than gold! And I need money sadly enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're awful poor, ain't you?\" asked Stumps, hitching up his pants.\r\n\r\n\"Been workin' all day and ain't got much in the pan,\" says Carrie,\r\nlooking sidewise at the few colors of gold in the bottom edge of the\r\npan.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes, Carrie. Look at my hands--hard and rough as the bark of a\r\ntree; but I don't mind that, Carrie, I was born here, I was born poor, I\r\nshall live poor and die poor. But I don't mind it, Carrie. I have my\r\nmother to love and look after, and while she lives I am content.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl looks at the woods, looks at the man, and then once more at the\r\nwoods, and at last in her helplessness to solve the problem, falls to\r\neating nuts, as usual; while the man continues, as if talking to\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n\"This is the peace of Paradise; and see the burning bush! Now I can\r\nwell understand that Moses saw the face of God in the bush of fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" the girl says to herself, \"if he only would be cross! If he only\r\nwould say something rough to us! If he only would cuss.\"\r\n\r\nShe resolves to say or do something to break the spell. She asks\r\neagerly:\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to give something to Stumps and me?--I mean Johnny and\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, to-morrow evening, after my work is done. And now I am going\r\nto tell you and Johnny what it is. It ain't much; it's the least little\r\nthing in the world; but I don't deserve any credit for even that--it's\r\nmy poor dear old mother's idea. She has laid there, day after day, on\r\nthe porch, and she has been thinking, not all the time of her own\r\nsickness and sorrow, but of others, as well; and she has thought much of\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy stands far aside, and at mention of this he jerks himself into a\r\nknot, his head drops down between his shoulders, his mouth puckers up,\r\nand he exclaims \"Oh, hoka!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thought of me?\" says Carrie.\r\n\r\n\"Of you, Carrie. And listen; I must tell you a little story. When I was\r\na very young man, and killed my first grizzly bear, I bought a little\r\npeach-tree and planted it in the corner of the yard, as people sometimes\r\nplant trees to remember things. Well, my mother, she had the ague that\r\nday powerful, for it was after melon-time, and she sat on the porch and\r\nshook, and shook, and shook, and watched me plant it, and when I got\r\ndone, my mother she cried. I don't know why she cried, Carrie, but she\r\ndid. She cried and she cried, and when I went up to her, and put my arms\r\naround her neck and kissed her, she only cried the more, for she was\r\nsort of hysteric-like, you know, and she said she knew she'd never live\r\nto eat any fruit off of that tree.\"\r\n\r\nCarrie stops eating nuts a moment.\r\n\r\n\"But she will--she will get well, Mr. John Logan--she will get well,\r\nwon't she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, indeed, I believe she will get well, but whether she ever gets\r\nright well or not, she certainly will live to eat peaches from that\r\ntree. Carrie, we've talked it all over, and what do you think? Why, now\r\nlisten, I will tell you. This tree that I planted, and that my poor sick\r\nmother was afraid she would not live to eat the fruit from--this tree\r\nwas a peach tree.\"\r\n\r\nCarrie again takes out a handful of nuts from her pocket, as if she\r\nwould like to eat them. She looks at them a second, throws them away,\r\nand hastens to one side.\r\n\r\n\"I want to go home,\" cries Stumps. \"I don't like peaches, Mr. John\r\nLogan. I don't--I don't--so help me,\" and the boy jerks at his pants\r\nwildly.\r\n\r\nJohn Logan turns to him kindly. \"Why, you never had a peach in your\r\nlittle hand in your life.\" Then turning to Carrie: \"Yes, Carrie, there\r\nhas grown this year, high up in the sun on that tree, side by side,\r\ntwo--and only two--red, ripe peaches. Why, children, don't run away!\r\nWait one moment, and I will go a little way with you. As I was about to\r\nsay, these two peaches are at last ripe. I own I was the least bit\r\nafraid, even after I saw them there on that bough one Summer morning,\r\nthat even then my mother might die before they became fully ripe. But\r\nnow they are ripe, and this evening I shall pull them. And to-morrow,\r\nafter my day's work is done, my sick mother shall eat one, and you two\r\nshall eat the other.\"\r\n\r\nCarrie puts up her hand and backs away.\r\n\r\n\"Don't--don't--don't call me Carrie; call me\r\nCarats--Carats--Carats--like the others do!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Carrie! What in the world is the matter with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"If a body steals, Mr. John Logan--if a body steals--what had a body\r\nbetter do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the Preacher says a body should confess--confess it, feel sorry,\r\nand be forgiven.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't--I can't confess, and I can't be forgiven!\"\r\n\r\nJohn Logan starts!\r\n\r\n\"You--you, Carrie; is it you? Then you have already confessed, and He\r\nwill forgive you!\"\r\n\r\n\"But such stealing as this nobody--nothing--can forgive,\" falling on her\r\nknees. \"I--I made my little brother steal your peaches!\"\r\n\r\n\"You!--you made him steal my two peaches that I wanted for my sick\r\nmother? You--_you_, Carrie?\"\r\n\r\nStumps rushed forward.\r\n\r\n\"No--No! I done it myself! I done it all myself--I did, so help me!\"\r\n\r\n\"But I made him do it!\" cries Carrie. \"I am the biggest, and I knew\r\nbetter--I knew better. But we couldn't eat 'em. Here they are--oh I am\r\nso glad we couldn't eat 'em!\" And they fall on their knees at his feet\r\ntogether; four little hands reach out the peaches to him eagerly,\r\nearnestly, as if in prayer to Heaven.\r\n\r\nThe man takes their little hands, and, choking with tears, says, in a\r\nvoice full of pathos and pity, and uncovering his head, with lifted\r\nface, as he remembers something of the story the good Priest so often\r\nread to his mother: \"and there was more joy in Heaven over the one that\r\nwas found, than over the ninety-and-nine that went not astray.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTWENTY CARATS FINE.\r\n\r\n    _A land that man has newly trod,\r\n      A land that only God has known,\r\n      Through all the soundless cycles flown.\r\n    Yet perfect blossoms bless the sod,\r\n      And perfect birds illume the trees,\r\n      And perfect unheard harmonies\r\n    Pour out eternally to God._\r\n\r\n    _A thousand miles of mighty wood\r\n      Where thunder-storms stride fire-shod;\r\n      A thousand flowers every rod,\r\n    A stately tree on every rood;\r\n      Ten thousand leaves on every tree,\r\n      And each a miracle to me;\r\n    And yet there be men who question God!_\r\n\r\nAt just what time these two waifs of the woods appeared in camp even\r\nForty-nine could not tell. They were first seen with the Indian woman\r\nwho went about among the miners, picking up bread and bits of coin by\r\ndancing, singing and telling fortunes. These two Indian women were\r\ngreat liars, and rogues altogether. I need not add that they were partly\r\ncivilized.\r\n\r\nThe little girl had been taught to dance and sing, and was quite a\r\nsource of revenue to the two Indian women, who had perhaps bought or\r\nstolen the children. As for the boy--poor stunted, starved little\r\nthing--he hung on to his sister's tattered dress all the time with his\r\nlittle red hand, wherever she went and whatever she did. He was her\r\nshadow; and he was at that time little more than a shadow in any way.\r\n\r\nSometimes men pitied the little girl, and gave very liberally. They\r\ntried to find out something about her past life; for although she was\r\nquite the color of the Indian, she had regular features, and at times\r\nher poor pinched face was positively beautiful. The two children looked\r\nas if they had been literally stunted in their growth from starvation\r\nand hardship.\r\n\r\nOnce a good-hearted old miner had bribed the squaws to let the children\r\ncome to his cabin and get something to eat. They came, and while they\r\nwere gorging themselves, the boy sitting close up to the girl all the\r\ntime, and looking about and back over his shoulder and holding on to\r\nher dress, this man questioned her about her life and history. She did\r\nnot like to talk; indeed, she talked with difficulty at first, and her\r\nfew English words fell from her lips in broken bits and in strange\r\nconfusion. But at length she began to speak more clearly as she\r\nproceeded with her story, and became excited in its narration. Then she\r\nwould stop and seem to forget it all. Then she went on, as if she was\r\ntelling a dream. Then there would be another long pause, and confusion,\r\nand she would stammer on in the most wild and incoherent fashion, till\r\nthe old miner became quite impatient, and thought her as big an imposter\r\nas the Indian woman whom she called her mother. He finally gave them\r\neach a loaf of bread, and told them they could go back to their lodge.\r\nThis lodge consisted of a few poles set up in wigwam fashion, and\r\ncovered with skins and old blankets and birch. A foul, ugly place it\r\nwas, but in this wigwam lived two Indian women and these two children.\r\n\r\nMen, or rather beasts--no, beasts are decent creatures; well then,\r\nmonsters, full of bad rum, would prowl about this wretched lodge at\r\nnight, and their howls, mixed with those of the savages, whom they had\r\nmade also drunk, kept up a state of things frightful to think of in\r\nconnection with these two sensitive, starving little waifs of the woods.\r\n\r\nWho were they, and where did they come from? Sometimes these children\r\nwould start up and fly from the lodge at night, and hide away in the\r\nbrush like hunted things, and only steal back at morning when all was\r\nstill. At such times the girl would wrap her little brother (if he was\r\nher brother) in her own scant rags, and hold him in her arms as he\r\nslept.\r\n\r\nOne night, while some strange Indians were lodging there, a still more\r\nterrible scene transpired in this dreadful little den than had yet been\r\nconceived. The two children fled as usual into the darkness, back into\r\nthe deep woods. Shots were heard, and then a death-yell that echoed far\r\nup and down the canyon. Then there were cries, shrieks of women, as if\r\nthey were being seized and borne away. Fainter and fainter grew their\r\ncries; further and further, down on the high ledge of the canyon in the\r\ndarkness, into the deep wood, they seemed to be borne. And at last their\r\ncries died away altogether.\r\n\r\nThe next morning a dead Indian was found at the door of the empty lodge.\r\nBut the women and the children were nowhere to be seen. Some said the\r\nIndian Agent's men had come to take the Indians away, and that the man\r\nresisting had been shot, while the women and children were taken to the\r\nReservation, where they belonged. But there was a darker story, and told\r\nunder the breath, and not spoken loud. Let it be told under the breath,\r\nand briefly here, also. Some drunken wretches had shot the Indians,\r\ncarried the women down to the dark woods above the deep swollen river,\r\nand then, after the most awful orgies ever chronicled, murdered them and\r\nsunk their bodies in the muddy river.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly a week after that the two children stole down from the\r\nwooded hill-side into the trail, where old Forty-nine found them on his\r\nreturn from work. They were so weak they could not speak or cry out for\r\nhelp. They could only reach their little hands and implore help, as,\r\ntimid and frightened, they tottered towards this first human being they\r\nhad dared to face for a whole week.\r\n\r\nThe strong man hesitated a moment; they looked so frightful he wanted to\r\nescape from their presence. But his grand, noble nature came to the\r\nsurface in a second; and dropping his pick and pan in the trail, he\r\ncaught up the two children, and in a moment more was, with one in each\r\narm, rushing down the trail to his cabin. He met some men, and passed\r\nothers. They all looked at him with wonder. One even laughed at him.\r\n\r\nAnd it is hard to comprehend this. There were good men--good in a\r\nmeasure; men who would have gallantly died to save a woman--men who were\r\ntrue men on points of honor; yet men who could not think of even being\r\ncivil to an Indian, or any one with a bit of Indian blood in his veins.\r\nIs our government responsible for this? I do not say so. I only know\r\nthat it exists; a hatred, a prejudice, more deeply seated and\r\nunreasonable than ever was that of the old slave-dealer for the black\r\nman.\r\n\r\nForty-nine did not return to his tunnel the next day, nor yet the next.\r\nThis cabin, wretched as it became in after years when he had fallen\r\ninto evil habits, had then plenty to eat, and there the starved little\r\nbeings ate as they had never eaten before.\r\n\r\nAt first the little boy would steal and hide away bread while he ate at\r\nthe table. The first night, after eating all he could, he slept with\r\nboth his pockets full and a chunk up his sleeve besides.\r\n\r\nThis boy was never a favorite. He was so weak, so dependent on his\r\nsister. It seemed as if he had been at one time frightened almost to\r\ndeath, and had never quite gotten over it. And so Forty-nine took most\r\nkindly to the girl, and they were soon fast friends. Yet ever and always\r\nher shadow, the little boy, whom Forty-nine named Johnny, kept at her\r\nside--as I have said before; his little red hand reached out and\r\nclutching at her tattered dress.\r\n\r\nAfter a few weeks the girl began to tell strange, wild stories to the\r\nold man. But observing that Forty-nine doubted these, as the other man\r\nhad, she called them dreams, and so would tell him these wild and\r\nterrible dreams of the desert, of blood, of murder and massacre, till\r\nthe old man himself, as the girl shrank up to him in terror, became\r\nalmost frightened. He did not like to hear these dreams, and she soon\r\nlearned not to repeat them.\r\n\r\nOne evening a passing miner stopped, placed a broad hand on either\r\ndoor-jamb, and putting his great head in at the open door, asked how the\r\nlittle \"copper-colored pets\" got on.\r\n\r\n\"Pard,\" answered Forty-nine, kindly, and with a nod of the head back\r\ntoward the children playing in the corner, \"they are not coppers; no,\r\nthey are not. I tell you that girl is not copper, but gold. Yes she is,\r\nPard; she is twenty carats.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty carats gold! Well, Twenty Carats, come here! Come here, Carats,\"\r\ncalled out the big head at the door.\r\n\r\nThe girl came forward, and a big hand fell down from the door-jamb on\r\nher bushy head of hair, and the man was pleased as he looked down into\r\nthe uplifted face. And so he called her \"Carats,\" and that became her\r\nname.\r\n\r\nOther passing miners stopped to look in at the open door where the big\r\nhead had looked and talked to the timid girl, and misunderstanding the\r\nname, they called her Carrie; and Carrie she was called ever afterwards.\r\n\r\nBut the boy who had been so thin, soon grew so fat and chubby that some\r\none named him \"Stumps.\" There was no good trying to get rid of that\r\nname. He looked as though his name ought to be Stumps, and Stumps it\r\nwas, in spite of the persistent efforts of old Forty-nine to keep the\r\nname in use which he had given him. And this was all that Forty-nine or\r\nany one could tell of these two children.\r\n\r\nAnd now, how beautiful Carrie had grown by the time the leaves turned\r\nbrown! Often Dosson saw her hovering about the cabin of old Forty-nine,\r\nflitting through the woods with her brother, or walking leisurely with\r\nLogan on the hill down the dim old Indian trail.\r\n\r\nMother Nature has her golden wedding once a year, and all the world is\r\ninvited. She has many gala days, too, besides, and she celebrates them\r\nwith songs and dances of delight. In the full bosomed, teeming, jocund\r\nSpring, I have seen the trees lean together and rustle their leaves in\r\nwhisperings of love. I have seen them reach their long strong arms to\r\neach other, and intertwine them as if in fond affection, as the bland,\r\nwarm winds, coming up from the South, blew over them and warmed their\r\nhearts of oak--old trees, too, gnarled and knotted--old fellows that had\r\nbobbed their heads together through many and many a Spring; that had\r\nleaned their lofty and storm-stained tops together through many and many\r\na Winter; that had stood, like mighty soldiers, shoulder to shoulder, in\r\nfriendships knit through many centuries. The birds sing and flutter, fly\r\nin and out of the dark deep canopies of green, build nests, and make\r\nlove in myriads. How the squirrels run and chatter and frisk, and fly\r\nfrom branch to branch, with their bushy tails tossing in the warm wind!\r\nUnder foot, ten thousand tall strange flowers and weeds and long\r\nspindled grasses grow, and reach up and up, as if to try to touch the\r\nsunlight above the tops of the oak and ash and pine and fir and cedar\r\nand maple and cherry and sycamore and spruce and tamarack, and all these\r\nthat grow in common confusion here and shut out the sun from the earth\r\nas perfectly as if all things dwelt forever in cloudland.\r\n\r\nThe cabin of old Forty-nine was very modest; it hid away in the canyon\r\nas if it did not wish to be seen at all. And it was right; for verily it\r\nwas scarcely presentable. It was an old cabin, too, almost as old as\r\nlittle \"Carats,\" if indeed any one could tell how old she was. But it,\r\nunlike herself, seemed to be growing tired and weary of the world. She\r\nhad been growing up as it had been growing down. The moss was gathering\r\nall over the round, rough logs on the outside, and the weeds and wild\r\nvines each year grew still more ambitious to get quite to the top of the\r\ncabin, and peep down into the mysterious crater of a chimney that\r\nforever smoked in a mournful and monotonous sort of way, as if watchers\r\nwere there--Vestal virgins, who dared not let their fires perish, on\r\npenalty of death.\r\n\r\n\"Drunken, wretched, cracked and crazy old Forty-nine,\" the camp said,\r\n\"he can never build a new cabin, for he can't stay sober long enough to\r\ncut down a tree.\" And the camp told the ugly truth.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't Forty-nine build a new cabin?\" asked Gar Dosson one day, as\r\nhe passed that way, with a string of fish in his hand and a coon on his\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\"Poor dear Forty-nine's got the shakes so he can't get time. It takes\r\nhim all the time to shake, and it takes all his money to buy his ager\r\nmedicine. Poor dear old Forty-nine!\" and the girl seemed to get a cinder\r\nor something in her eye.*****\r\n\r\nAs the sun settled low, one afternoon, and cast long, creeping shadows\r\nover the flowery land--shadows that lay upon and crept along the ground,\r\nas if they were weary of the day, and would like to lie there and sleep,\r\nand sleep, forever--the stealthy step of a man was heard approaching the\r\nold cabin. There was something of the tiger in the man's movements, and\r\nit was clear that his mission, whatever it was, was not a mission of\r\npeace.*****\r\n\r\nThe man stands out in the clearing of the land before the cabin, and\r\npeers right and left up the trail and down the trail, and then leans and\r\nlistens. Then he takes a glance back over his shoulder at his companion\r\nand follower, Gar Dosson, and being sure that he too is on the alert and\r\nclose on his heels, he steps forward. Again the man leans and listens,\r\nbut seeing no signs of life and hearing no sound, he straightens up,\r\nwalks close to the cabin, and calls out:\r\n\r\n\"Hello, the house!\" at the same time he looks to the priming of his gun,\r\nand then fixes his eye on the door as it slowly opens. He drops the\r\nbreech hastily to the ground as the face of Carrie peers forth.\r\n\r\n\"Beg pardon, Carrie, my girl! Is it only you miss? Beg pardon--but we\r\nare lookin' for a gentleman--a young gentleman, John Logan.\"\r\n\r\nThe man is terribly embarrassed as the girl looks him straight in the\r\nface, and his companion falls back into the woods until almost hidden\r\nfrom view.\r\n\r\n\"Well, and why do you come here, skulking like Indians?\"\r\n\r\nThe man falls back; but recovering, he says, over his shoulder, as he\r\nturns to go:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, skulking around your cabin, like that other Injun, John Logan!\"\r\n\r\nThe man jerks the coon-skin cap up on his left ear as he says this, and,\r\ntossing his head, steps back into the thick woods and is gone.\r\n\r\nLater in the evening, John Logan, gun in hand, passes slowly and\r\ndreamily down the trail, close to old Forty-nine's cabin. Stumps and\r\nCarrie are at play in the wood close at hand, and come forth at a bound.\r\n\r\n\"Booh!\" cries Carrie, darting around from behind a tree. \"Booh! Mr. John\r\nLogan,\" continues the girl, and then with her two dimpled brown hands\r\nshe throws back the glorious storm of black abundant hair, that all the\r\ntime tumbles about her beautiful face.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Carrie, is that you? and Stumps, too? I am glad to see you. I--I\r\nwas feeling awful lonesome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Been down to Squire Fields' again, haven't you?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl has reached one hand out against a tree, and half leaning on it\r\nswings her right foot to and fro. John Logan starts just a little, looks\r\nat her, sighs, sets the breech of his gun on the ground, and as his eyes\r\nturn to hers, she sees he is very sad.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Carrie, I--I am lonesome at my cabin since--since mother died. All\r\nthe time, Carrie, I see her as I saw her that night, when I got home,\r\nsitting there on the porch, looking straight out at the gate, waiting\r\nfor me, her hand on the dog's head, as if to hold him.\"\r\n\r\nAs he says this, poor little Stumps stands up close against a tree,\r\ndraws his head down, and pulls up his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, her long bony fingers resting on his head, holding him--and the\r\nfaithful dog never moving for fear he would disturb her--for she was\r\ndead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mr. John Logan, don't tell me about it--don't!\" and the girl's\r\napron is again raised to her face as she shudders.\r\n\r\n\"Poor old woman with the holler eyes,\" says Stumps to himself, in a tone\r\nthat is scarcely audible.\r\n\r\n\"But there, never mind.\" The strong, handsome fellow brushes a tear\r\naside, and taking up his gun again, tries to be cheerful, and shake off\r\nthe care that encompasses him.\r\n\r\n\"And you got lonesome, and went down to see Sylvia Fields, didn't you?\"\r\n\r\nAgain the girl's foot swings, and she looks askance from under her dark,\r\nheavy hair, at John Logan.\r\n\r\n\"Carrie, listen to me. Ever since I can remember, my mother waited and\r\nwatched for my coming at my cabin door. But now, only think how lonely\r\nit is to live there. I can't go away. I have no fortune, no friends, no\r\npeople. What would people say to me and of me out in the great world?\r\nWell, I went to Squire Fields, and I had a long talk with Sylvia.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl starts, and almost chokes.\r\n\r\n\"Been to see Sylvia Fields!\" and with her booted foot she kicks the bark\r\nof a tree with all her might. \"Had a long talk with her!\" Then she\r\nwhirls around, plunges her hand in her pocket, and swings her dress and\r\nsays, as she pouts out her mouth,\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I feel just awful!\"\r\n\r\nJohn Logan approaches her.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Carrie, what's the matter?\"\r\n\r\nCarrie still swings herself, and turns her back to the man as she says,\r\nhalf savagely,\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what's the matter, and I don't care what's the matter; but\r\nI feel just awful, I do! I feel just like the dickens!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Carrie, you ought to be very, very happy, with all this beautiful\r\nscenery, and the sweet air in your hair and on your rosy face. And then\r\nwhat a lady you have grown to be! Now don't look cross at me like that!\r\nYou ought to be as happy as a bird.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I ain't happy; I ain't happy a bit, I ain't!\" Then, after a pause\r\nshe continues:\r\n\r\n\"I don't like that Gar Dosson. He was here looking for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here? Looking for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and he called old Forty-nine Old Blossom-nose. I just hate him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, Carrie, you know Forty-nine does drink dreadfully, and you\r\nknow he has got a dreadful red face.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. John Logan,\" cries Carrie, hotly, \"Forty-nine don't drink\r\ndreadfully. He don't drink dreadfully at all. He does take something for\r\nhis ager, but he don't drink.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, his face is dreadful red, anyway,\" answers John Logan.\r\n\r\nCarrie, swinging her foot and thoughtfully looking up at the trees,\r\nsays, after a pause:\r\n\r\n\"Do the trees drink? Do the trees and the bushes drink, John Logan?\r\nTheir faces get awfully red in the fall, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Carrie, you are cross to-day.\"\r\n\r\nCarrie, shrugging her shoulders and shaking her dress as if she would\r\nshake it off her, snaps: \"I ain't cross.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you are,\" and the tawny man comes up to her and speaks in a kindly\r\ntone: \"But come. Many a pleasant walk we have had in these woods\r\ntogether, and many a pleasant time we will have together still.\"\r\n\r\n\"We won't!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but we will! Come, you must not be so cross!\"\r\n\r\nThe girl leans her forehead against the tree on her lifted arm, and\r\nswings her other foot. She looks down at the rounded ankle, and says,\r\nalmost savagely, to herself; \"She's got bigger feet than I have. She's\r\ngot nearly twice as big feet, she has.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Logan looks at the girl with a profound tenderness, as she stands\r\nthere, pouting and swinging her foot. He attempts to approach her, but\r\nshe still holds her brow bowed to the tree upon her arm, and seems not\r\nto see him. He shoulders his gun and walks past her, and says, kindly,\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Carrie.\"\r\n\r\nBut the girl's eyes are following him, although she would not be willing\r\nto admit it, even to herself. As he is about to disappear, she thrusts\r\nher hand madly through her hair, and pulls it down all in a heap. Still\r\nlooking at him under her brows, still swinging her foot wildly, she\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"Do you think red hair is so awful ugly?\"\r\n\r\nAnd what a wondrous glory of hair it was! It was so intensely black; and\r\nthen it had that singular fringe of fire, or touch of Titian color,\r\nwhich seen in the sunset made it almost red.\r\n\r\nThe man stops, turns, comes back a step or two, as she continues:\r\n\r\n\"I do--I do! Oh, I wish to Moses I had tow hair, I do, like Sylvia\r\nFields.\"\r\n\r\nThe man is standing close beside her now. He is looking down into her\r\nface and she feels his presence. The foot does not swing so violently\r\nnow, and the girl has cautiously, and, as she believes, unseen, lifted\r\nthe edge of her tattered sleeve to her eyes. \"Why Carrie, your hair is\r\nnot red.\" And he speaks very tenderly. \"Carrie, you are going to be\r\nbeautiful. You are beautiful now. You are very beautiful!\"\r\n\r\nCarrie is not so angry now. The foot stops altogether, and she lifts her\r\nface and says:\r\n\r\n\"No I ain't--I ain't beautiful! Don't you try to humbug me. I am ugly,\r\nand I know it! For, last winter, when I went down to the grocery to\r\nfetch Forty-nine--he'd gone down there to get medicine for his ager, Mr.\r\nJohn Logan--I heard a man say, 'She is ugly as a mud fence.' Oh, I went\r\nfor him! I made the fur fly! But that didn't make me pretty. I was ugly\r\nall the same. No, I'm not pretty--I'm ugly, and I know it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, you're not. You are beautiful, and getting lovelier every day.\"\r\nCarrie softens and approaches him.\r\n\r\n\"Am I, John Logan? And you really don't think red hair is the ugliest\r\nthing in the world?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do I really not think red hair is the ugliest thing in the world? Why,\r\nCarrie?\"\r\n\r\nCarrie, starting back, looks in his face and says, bitterly: \"You do.\r\nYou do think red hair is the ugliest thing in all this born world, and I\r\njust dare you to deny it. Sylvia Fields--she's got white hair, she has,\r\nand you like white hair, you do. I despise her; I despise her so much\r\nthat I almost choke.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, now, Carrie, what makes you despise Sylvia Fields?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know; I don't know why I despise her, but I do. I despise her\r\nwith all my might and soul and body. And I tell you, Mr. John Logan,\r\nthat\"--here the lips begin to quiver, and she is about to burst into\r\ntears--\"I tell you, Mr. John Logan, that I do hope she likes ripe\r\nbananas; and I do hope that if she does like ripe bananas, that when\r\nbananas come to camp this fall, that she will take a ripe banana and try\r\nfor to suck it; and I do hope she will suck a ripe banana down her\r\nthroat, and get choked to death on it, I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Carrie, this is very wicked!\" cries John Logan, reproachfully, \"and\r\nI must leave you if you talk that way. Good-bye,\" and the man shoulders\r\nhis gun and again turns away.\r\n\r\n\"Well, do you think red hair is the ugliest thing in the world? Do you?\r\nDo you now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Carrie, don't you know I love the beautiful, red woods of autumn?\"\r\n\r\nIt is the May-day of the maiden's life; the May shower is over again,\r\nand the girl lifts her beautiful face, and says lightly, almost laughing\r\nthrough her tears,\r\n\r\n\"And, oh, you did like the red bush, didn't you, Mr. John Logan? And,\r\noh, you did say that Moses saw the face of God in the burning bush,\r\ndidn't you, Mr. John Logan?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you to tell me a story, I do,\" interposes Stumps. The boy had\r\nstood there a long time, first on one foot, then on the other, swinging\r\nhis squirrel, pouting out his mouth, and waiting.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, tell us a story,\" urges Carrie.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, tell us a story about a coon--no, about a panther--no, a bear.\r\nOh, yes, about a bear! about a bear!\" cries the boy, \"about a bear!\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor, half-wild children!\" sighs John Logan. \"Nothing to divert them,\r\ntheir little minds go out, curiously seeking something new and strange,\r\njust, I fancy as older and abler people's do in larger ways. Yes, I will\r\ntell you a story about a bear. And let us sit down; my long walk has\r\ntired my legs;\" and he looks about for a resting place.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, here, this mossy log!\" cries Stumps; \"it's as soft as silk. You\r\nwill sit there, and I here, and sister there.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Logan leans his gun against a tree, hanging his pouch on the gun.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I will sit here--and you, Carrie?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here. Oh, John Logan, I just fit in.\"\r\n\r\nOne of Logan's arms falls loosely around Carrie, the other more loosely\r\naround Stumps.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's a nice fit, Carrie--couldn't be better if cut out by a\r\ntailor.\"\r\n\r\nCarrie, swinging her feet, and looking in his face, very happy,\r\nexclaims:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, John Logan! Don't hold me too tight--you might hurt me!\"\r\n\r\nStumps laughs. \"He don't hold me tight enough to hurt me a bit.\" Then\r\nlooking up in his face, says, \"I want a bear story, I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I will tell you a story out of the Bible. Once upon a time there\r\nwas a great, good man--a very good and a very earnest man. Well, this\r\nvery good old man, who was very bald headed, took a walk one evening;\r\nand the very good old man passed by a lot of very bad boys. And these\r\nvery bad boys saw the very bald head of the very good man and they\r\nsaid, 'Go up, old bald head! Go up, old bald head!' And it made this\r\ngood man very mad; and he turned, and he called a she-bear out of the\r\nwoods, and she ate up about forty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" cries Stumps, aghast.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" adds Carrie. \"And he wasn't a very good man. He might have been a\r\nvery bald-headed man, but he wasn't a very good man to have her eat all\r\nthe children, Mr. John Logan.\"\r\n\r\nStumps, nursing his squirrel, with his head on one side, says:\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't believe it, no how--I don't! What was his name--the old,\r\nbald-head?\"\r\n\r\n\"His name was Elijah, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Elijah! The bald-headed Elijah! Oh, I do believe it, then; for I know\r\nwhen Forty-nine and the curly-headed grocery-keeper were playing poker,\r\nat ten cents ante and pass the buck--when Forty-nine went down to get\r\nhis ager medicine, sister--Forty-nine, he went a blind; and the\r\ncurly-headed grocery-keeper he straddled it, and then Forty-nine seed\r\nhim, he did. And so help me! he raked in the pot on a Jack full. And\r\nthen the curly-headed grocery-keeper jumped up, and struck his fist on\r\nthe table, and he said, 'By the bald-headed Elijah!'\"\r\n\r\nCarrie nestles closer, and in a half whisper, mutters,\r\n\r\n\"I believe I'm getting a little chilly.\"\r\n\r\nStumps hears this, and says,\r\n\r\n\"Why, Carrie, I'm just a sweatin', and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Shoo! What noise was that? There is some one stealing through the\r\nbush!\"\r\n\r\nJohn Logan, as he spoke, rose up softly and cautiously, and half bent\r\nforward as he put the two children aside and reached his gun. He looked\r\nat the cap, ran an eye along the barrel, and then twisted his belt about\r\nso that a pistol was just visible beneath his coat. The man had had an\r\nintimation of trouble. Indeed, his gun had been at hand all this time,\r\nbut he did not care to frighten the two happy waifs of the woods with\r\nany thought of what might happen to him, and even to them.\r\n\r\nThese children had but one thing to dread. There was but one terrible\r\nword to them in the language. It was not hunger, not starvation,--no,\r\nnot even death. It was the _Reservation_! That one word meant to them,\r\nas it means to all who are liable to be carried there, captivity,\r\nslavery, degradation, and finally death, in its most dreadful form.\r\n\r\nAnd why should it be so dreaded? Make the case your own, if you are a\r\nlover of liberty, and you can understand.\r\n\r\nStatistics show that more than three-fourths of all Indians removed to\r\nReservations of late years, die before becoming accustomed to the new\r\norder of things.\r\n\r\nYet Indians do not really fear death. But they do dread captivity. They\r\nare so fond of their roving life, their vast liberty--room! An Indian is\r\ntoo brave to commit suicide, save in the most rare and desperate cases.\r\nBut his heart breaks from home-sickness, and he dies there in despair.\r\nAnd then to see his helpless little children die, one by one, with the\r\nburning fever, which always overtakes the poor captives!\r\n\r\n\"How many of us died? I do not know. We counted them at first. But when\r\nthere were dead women and children in every house and not men enough to\r\nbury them, I did not count any more,\" said one of the survivors when\r\nquestioned.\r\n\r\nIn earlier times, some of these Reservations were well chosen--the one\r\non the Ummatilla, Oregon, for example. But of late years it would seem\r\nas if the most deadly locations had been selected. Perhaps this is\r\nthought best by those in authority, as the land is soon wanted by the\r\nwhites if it is at all fit for their use. And the Indians in such cases\r\nare sooner or later made to move on.\r\n\r\nThis particular Reservation in California, however, never has been and\r\nnever will be required or used by any man, except for a grave.\r\n\r\nWhy, in the name of humanity, such things are left to the choice and\r\ndiscretion of strangers, new men, men who know nothing about Indians and\r\ncare nothing for them, except so far as they can coin their blood, is\r\nincomprehensible. It is a crime. Way out yonder, in the heart of a\r\nburning plain, by the side of an alkali lake that fairly reeked with\r\nmalaria, where even reptiles died, where wild fowl never were found; a\r\nplace that even beasts knew better than to frequent, without wood or\r\nwater, save stunted sage and juniper and slimy alkali, in the very\r\nvalley of death--this Reservation had been established.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, just the place. A place where we can use our cavalry when they\r\nattempt to escape,\" said the young sprig of an officer, when some men\r\nwith a spark of humanity dared to protest.\r\n\r\nAnd that was the reason for removing it so far from the sweet, pure air\r\nand water of the Sierras, and setting these poor captives down in the\r\nvalley of death.\r\n\r\nWhen they try to escape! Did it never occur to the United States to make\r\na Reservation pleasant and healthy enough for an Indian to be content\r\nin? My word for it, if you will give him a place fit to live in, he will\r\nbe willing to make his home there.\r\n\r\nI know nothing in history so dark and dreadful as the story of the\r\nIndians in this dreaded and deadly Reservation of the valley. The\r\nIndians surrendered on condition that they should be taken to good homes\r\nand taught the ways of the white man. Once in the white man's power, the\r\nchains began to tighten, tighten at every step. Once there, they were\r\ndivided into lots, families torn apart, and put to work under guard;\r\nmen stood over them with loaded muskets. The land was full of malaria.\r\nThese men of the mountains began to sicken, to die; to die by\r\ndegrees,--to die, as the hot weather came on, by hundreds. At last a few\r\nof the strongest, the few still able to stand, broke away and found\r\ntheir way back to the mountains. They were like living skeletons, skin\r\nand bone only, hollow-eyed and horrible to look upon. Toward the last,\r\nthese poor Indians had crawled on their hands and knees to get back.\r\nThey were followed by the soldiers, and taken wherever they could be\r\nfound; taken back to certain death. One, a young man, still possessed of\r\na little strength, fought with sticks and stones with all his might as\r\nhe lay in the trail where he had fallen in his flight. He lifted his two\r\nbony hands between the foe and his dying old father. The two were taken\r\nand chained together. That night the young man with an old pair of\r\nscissors, which he had borrowed on pretense of wanting to trim his hair,\r\nkilled the old man by pushing one of the points into his heart. You\r\ncould see by the marks of blood on the young man's hand next morning,\r\nthat he had felt more than once to see if the old man was quite dead.\r\nThen he drove the point of the scissors in his own heart, and crawled\r\nupon the old man's body, embraced it and died there. And yet all this\r\nhad been done so quietly that the two guards who marched back and forth\r\nonly a few feet distant, did not know till next morning that anything of\r\nthe kind had been. Sometimes these wretches would beg, and even steal,\r\non their way back from the dreadful Reservation. They were frightful,\r\nterrible, at such times. They sometimes stood far off outside the gate,\r\nand begged with outstretched hands. Their appearances were so against\r\nthem, hungry, dying; and then this traditional hatred of four hundred\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nBut this is too much digression. John Logan knew all the wrongs of his\r\npeople only too well. He sympathized with them. And this meant his own\r\nruin. A few Indians had made their way back of late, and John Logan had\r\nharbored them while the authorities were in pursuit. This was enough. An\r\norder had been sent to bring in John Logan.\r\n\r\nHe knew of this, and that was why he now stood all alert and on fire,\r\nas these two men came stealing through the bush and straight for him.\r\nShould he fire? To shoot, to shoot at, to even point a gun at a white\r\nman, is death to the Indian. A slave of the South had been ten-fold more\r\nsafe in striking his master in the old days of slavery, than is an\r\nIndian on the border in defending his person against a white man.\r\n\r\nThe two children, like frightened pheasants, when the old one gives\r\nsigns of danger, darted down behind him, quick as thought, still as\r\ndeath. Their desperate and destitute existence in that savage land had\r\nmade them savages in their cunning and caution. They said no word, made\r\nno sign. Their eyes were fixed on his every step and motion. He signaled\r\nthem back. They darted like squirrels behind trees, and up and on\r\nthrough the thicket, toward the steep and inaccessible bluffs above. The\r\ntwo men saw the retreating children. They wanted Carrie. They darted\r\nforward; one of them jerked out and held up a paper in the face of John\r\nLogan.\r\n\r\n\"We want you at the Reservation. Come!\"\r\n\r\nPhin Emens stood full before Logan. He shook the paper in his face. The\r\nman did not move. Carrie was fast climbing up the mountain. She was\r\nabout to escape. Gar Dosson was furious. He attempted to pass, to climb\r\nthe mountain, and to get at the girl. Still Logan kept himself between\r\nas he slowly retreated.\r\n\r\n\"Stand aside, and let me get that girl. I must take _her_, too!\" shouted\r\nDosson. Still Logan kept the man back. And now the children had escaped.\r\nWild with rage, Dosson caught Logan by the shoulder and shouted, \"Come!\"\r\nWith a blow that might have felled an ox, the Indian brought the man to\r\nthe ground. Then, grasping his rifle in his right hand, he darted\r\nthrough the thicket after the retreating children, up the mountain,\r\nwhile Phin Emens stooped over his fallen friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMAN-HUNTERS.\r\n\r\n    \"_He caused the dry land to appear._\"\r\n                                        --BIBLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _The mountains from that fearful first\r\n    Named day were God's own house. Behold,\r\n    'Twas here dread Sinai's thunders burst\r\n    And showed His face. 'Twas here of old\r\n    His prophets dwelt. Lo, it was here\r\n    The Christ did come when death drew near._\r\n\r\n    _Give me God's wondrous upper world\r\n    That makes familiar with the moon\r\n    These stony altars they have hurled\r\n    Oppression back, have kept the boon\r\n    Of liberty. Behold, how free\r\n    The mountains stand, and eternally._\r\n\r\n\r\nSuccess makes us selfish. The history of the world chronicles no\r\nprosperity like that of ours; and so, thinking of only ourselves and our\r\nsuccess, we forget others. It is easy, indeed, to forget the misery of\r\nothers; and we hate to be told of it, too.\r\n\r\nOn a high mountain side overlooking the valley, hung a little camp like\r\na bird's nest. It was hidden there in the densest wood, yet it looked\r\nout over the whole land. No bird, indeed no mother of her young, ever\r\nchose a deeper or wilder retreat, or a place more utterly apart from the\r\npaths and approaches of mankind.\r\n\r\nCertainly the little party had stood in imminent peril of capture, and\r\nhad prized freedom dearly indeed, to climb these crags and confront the\r\nvery snow-peaks in their effort to make certain their safety.\r\n\r\nAnd a little party, too, it must have been; for you could have passed\r\nwithin ten feet of the camp and not discovered it by day. And by night?\r\nWell, certainly by night no man would peril his life by an uncertain\r\nfooting on the high cliffs here, only partly concealed by the thick\r\ngrowth of chaparral, topt by tall fir and pine and cedar and tamarack.\r\nAnd so a little fire was allowed to burn at night, for it was near the\r\nsnow and always cold. And it was this fire, perhaps, that first betrayed\r\nthe presence of the fugitives to the man-hunters.\r\n\r\nVery poor and wretched were they, too. If they had had more blankets\r\nthey might not have so needed the fire. So poor were they, in fact, that\r\nyou might have stood in the very heart of the little camp and not\r\ndiscovered any property at all without looking twice. A little heap of\r\nashes in the center sending up a half-smothered smoke, two or three\r\nloose California lion-skins, thrown here and there over the rocks, a\r\npair of moccasins or two, a tomahawk--and that was almost all. No\r\ncooking utensils had they--for what had they to cook? No eating\r\nutensils--for what had they to eat?\r\n\r\nGreat gnarled and knotty trees clung to the mountain side beyond, and a\r\nlittle to the left a long, thin cataract, which, from the valley far\r\nbelow, looked like a snowy plume, came pitching down through the tree\r\ntops. It had just been let loose from the hand of God--this sheen of\r\nshining water. Back and beyond all this, a peak of snow, a great pyramid\r\nand shining shaft of snow, with a crown of clouds, pierced heaven.\r\n\r\nStealthily, and on tip-toe, two armed men, both deeply disguised in\r\ngreat black beards, and in good clothes, stepped into this empty little\r\ncamp. Bending low, looking right, looking left, guns in hand and hand\r\non trigger, they stopped in the centre of the little camp, and looked\r\ncautiously up, down, and all around. Seeing no one, hearing nothing,\r\nthey looked in each others' eyes, straightened up, and, standing their\r\nguns against a tree, breathed more freely in the gray twilight. Wicked,\r\nbeastly-looking men were they, as they stood there loosening their\r\ncollars, taking in their breath as if they had just had a hard climb,\r\nand looking about cautiously; hard, cruel and cunning, they seemed as if\r\nthey partook something of the ferocity of the wild beasts that prowled\r\nthere at night.\r\n\r\nThese two large animal-looking men were armed with pistols also. But at\r\nthe belt of each hung and clanked and rattled something more terrible\r\nthan any implement of death.\r\n\r\nThese were manacles! Irons! Chains for human hands!\r\n\r\nDid it never occur to you as a little remarkable, that man only forges\r\nchains and manacles for his fellow-man? A cage will do for a wild beast,\r\ncattle are put in pens, bears in a pit, but man must be chained. Men\r\ncarry these manacles with them only when they set out to take their\r\nfellow-man. These two men were man-hunters.\r\n\r\nStanding there, manacles in hand, half beast and half devil, they were\r\nin the employment of the United States. They were sent to take John\r\nLogan, Carrie and Johnny, to the Reservation--the place most hated,\r\ndreaded, abhorred of all earthly places, the Reservation! Back of these\r\ntwo men lay a deeper, a more damning motive for the capture of the girl\r\nthan the United States was really responsible for; for the girl, as we\r\nhave seen, was very beautiful. This rare wild flower had now almost\r\nmatured in the hot summer sun just past. But remember, it was all being\r\ndone in the name of and under the direction of, and, in fact, by, the\r\nUnited States Government.\r\n\r\nTo say nothing of the desire of agents and their deputies to capture and\r\npossess beautiful girls, it is very important to any Indian agent that\r\neach victim, even though he be half or three-quarters, or even entirely,\r\nwhite, be kept on the Reservation; for every captive is so much money in\r\nthe hands of the Indian agent. He must have Indians, as said before, to\r\nreport to the Government in order to draw blankets, provisions,\r\nclothes, and farming utensils for them. True, the Indians do not get a\r\ntithe of these things, but he must be on the Reservation roll-call in\r\norder that the agent may draw them in his name.\r\n\r\nThis agency had become remarkably thin of Indians. The mountain Indians,\r\naccustomed to pure water and fresh air, could not live long in the hot,\r\nfever-stricken valley. They died by hundreds. And then, as if utterly\r\nregardless of the profits of the agents of the Reservation, they hung\r\nthemselves in their prison-pens, with their own chains. Two, father and\r\nson, killed themselves with the same knife one night while chained\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThere was just a little bit of the old Roman in these liberty-loving\r\nnatures, it seemed to me. See the father giving himself the death-wound,\r\nand then handing the knife to his son! The two chained apart, but still\r\nable to grasp each other's hands; grasping hands and dying so! Very\r\nantique that, it seems to me, in its savage valor--love of liberty, and\r\nlofty contempt of death. But then it was only Indians, and happened so\r\nrecently.\r\n\r\nIt is true, Gar Dosson wanted revenge and the girl; and the two men\r\nwanted the little farm. Yet do not forget that back of all this lay that\r\ngranite and immovable mountain of fact, that other propelling principle\r\nto compel them on to the hunt, the order, the sanction--the gold--of the\r\ngovernment. Let it be told with bowed head, with eyes to the ground, and\r\ncheeks crimson with shame! Think of one of these hunted human beings--a\r\nbeautiful young girl, just at that sweet and tender, almost holy period\r\nof life, the verge of womanhood, when every man of the land should start\r\nup with a noble impulse to throw the arm of protection about her!\r\n\r\n\"Shoo! they must be close about,\" began the shorter of the two ruffians,\r\nreaching back for his gun, as if he had heard something.\r\n\r\n\"No. Didn't you see that squirrel shucking a hazel nut on that rock\r\nthere, just afore we came in?\" said the other.\r\n\r\n\"A bushy-tailed gray? Yes, seed him scamper up a saplin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, don't you know that if they had a bin hereabouts, a squirrel\r\nwouldn't a sot down there to shuck a nut?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right! You've been among Injins so long that you know more about them\r\nthan they do themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, what I don't know about an Injin no one don't know. They've gone\r\nfor grub, and will come back at sun-down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come back here at sun-down?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you see the skins there? Whar kin they sleep? They'll come afore\r\ndark, for even an Injin can't climb these rocks after dark. And when the\r\ngal's in camp, and that feller fixed--eh? eh?\" And he tapped and rattled\r\nthe manacles.\r\n\r\n\"Eh? eh? old Toppy?\" and the two men poked each other in the ribs, and\r\nlooked the very villains that they were.\r\n\r\n\"But let's see what they've got here. Two tiger-skins, an old moccasin\r\nand a tomahawk;\" he looked at the handle and read the name, JOHN LOGAN;\r\n\"Guess I'll hide that,\" said the agent, as he kicked the skins about,\r\nand then stuck the tomahawk up under his belt. \"Guess that's about all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess that's about all!\" sneered the other; \"that's about all you know\r\nabout Injuns. Allers got your nose to the ground, too. Look here!\" And\r\nthe man, who had been walking about and looking up in the trees, here\r\ndrew down a bundle from the boughs of a fir.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll swar! ef you can't find things where a coon dog couldn't!\"\r\n\r\n\"Find things!\" exclaimed the other, as he prepared to examine the\r\ncontents of the bundle; \"all you've got to do is to look into a fir-tree\r\nin an Injun's camp. You see, bugs and things won't climb a fir gum;\r\nnothing but a red-bellied squirrel will go up a fir gum, for fear of\r\nsticking in the wax; and even a squirrel won't, if there is a string\r\ntied around, for fear of a trap. Wal, there is the string. So you see an\r\nInjun's _cache_ is as safe up a fir-tree as under lock and key. Ah,\r\nthey're awful short of grub. Look thar! Been gnawing that bone, and\r\nthey've put that away for their suppers, I swar!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, the grub is short, eh? They'll be rather thin, I'm thinking.\"\r\n\r\nThe other did not notice this remark, but throwing the bundle aside, he\r\nrose up and went back to the tree.\r\n\r\n\"By the beardy Moses! Look thar!\" and the man looked about as if half\r\nfrightened, and then held up a bottle.\r\n\r\n\"Whisky?\" asked the other, springing eagerly forward.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered the man, contemptuously, after smelling the bottle.\r\n\r\n\"Water, eh?\" queried the other, with disgust.\r\n\r\n\"Wine! And look here. Do you know what that means? It means a white man!\r\nYes, it does. No Injin ever left a cork in a bottle. Now, you look\r\nsharp. There will be a white man to tackle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, I guess he won't be much of a white man, or he'd have whisky.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shoo! I heard a bird fly down the canyon. Somebody's a comin' up thar.\"\r\n\r\n\"We better git, eh?\" said the other, getting his gun; \"lay for 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lay low and watch our chance. Maybe we'll come in on 'em friendly like,\r\nif there's white men. We're cattle men, you know; men hunting cattle,\"\r\nsays the other, getting his gun and leading off behind the crags in the\r\nrear. \"Leave me to do the talking. I'll tell a thing, and you'll swear\r\nto it. Wait, let's see,\" and he approaches the edge of the rocks, and,\r\nleaning over, looked below.\r\n\r\n\"See 'em?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shoo! Look down there. The gal! She's a fawn. She's as pretty as a\r\ntiger-lily. Ah, my beauty!\"\r\n\r\nThe other man stood up, shook his head thoughtfully, and seemed to\r\nhesitate. The watcher still kept peering down; then he turned and said:\r\n\"The white man is old Forty-nine. He comes a bobbin' and a limpin' along\r\nwith a keg on his back, and a climbin' up the mountain sidewise, like a\r\ncrab.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whoop! I have it. It's wine, and they'll get drunk. Forty-nine will get\r\ndrunk, don't you see, and then?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a wise 'un! Shake!\" And they grasped hands.\r\n\r\n\"You bet! Now this is the little game. The gal and Logan, and the boy,\r\nwill get here long first. Well, now, maybe we will go for the gal and\r\nthe boy. But if we don't, we just lay low till all get sot down, and at\r\nthat keg the old man's got, and then we just come in. Cattle-men, back\r\nin the mountains, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the game. But here they come! Shoo!\" and with his finger to his\r\nlip the leader stole behind the rocks, both looking back over their\r\nshoulders, as Carrie entered the camp.\r\n\r\nHer pretty face was flushed from exertion, and brown as a berry where\r\nnot protected by the shock of black hair. She swung a broad straw hat in\r\nher hand, and tossed her head as if she had never worn and never would\r\nwear any other covering for it than that so bountifully supplied by\r\nnature. She danced gaily, and swung her hat as she flew about the little\r\ncamp, and called at her chubby cherub of a brother over her shoulder. At\r\nlast, puffing and blowing, and wiping his forehead, he entered camp and\r\nthrew himself on one of the rocks.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you ain't tired, are you Johnny?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, oh, oh,--no, I--I--I ain't tired a bit!\" and he wiped his brow, and\r\npuffed and blowed, in spite of all his efforts to restrain himself.\r\n\r\n\"Why you like to climb the mountains, Johnny. Don't you know you said\r\nyou liked to climb the mountains better than to eat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, yes--I--I like to climb a mountain. That is, I like to climb\r\none mountain at a time. But when there are two or three mountains all\r\npiled up on top of one another, Oh, oh, oh!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Johnny! You to go to bragging about climbing mountains! You can't\r\nclimb mountains!\" And again the girl, with shoes that would hardly hold\r\ntogether, a dress in ribbons, and a face not unfamiliar with the dirt of\r\nthe earth, danced back and forth before him and sung snatches of a\r\nmountain song. \"Oh, I'm so happy up here, Johnny. I always sing like a\r\nbird up here.\" Then, looking in his face, she saw that he was very\r\nthoughtful; and stepping back, and then forward, she said: \"Why, what\r\nmakes you so serious? They won't never come up here, will they, Johnny?\r\nNot even if somebody at the Reservation wanted me awful bad, and\r\nsomebody gave somebody lots of money to take me back, they couldn't\r\nnever come up here, could they, Johnny?\" And the girl looked eagerly\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, Carrie, you are safe here. Why, you are as safe here as in a\r\nfort.\"\r\n\r\n\"This mountain is God's fort, John Logan says, Johnny. It is for the\r\neagles to live in and the free people to fly to; for my people to climb\r\nup out of danger and talk to the Great Spirit that inhabits it.\" The\r\ngirl clasped her hands and looked up reverently as she said this. \"But\r\ncome, now, Johnny, don't be serious, and I will sing you the nicest song\r\nI know till Forty-nine comes up the mountain; and I will dance for you,\r\nJohnny, and I will do all that a little girl can do to make you glad and\r\nhappy as I am, Johnny.\"\r\n\r\nHere John Logan came up the hill, and the girl stopped and said, very\r\nseriously,\r\n\r\n\"And you are right sure, John Logan, nobody will get after us\r\nagain?--nobody follow us away up here, jam up, nearly against Heaven?\"\r\n\r\nHere the two men looked out.\r\n\r\n\"No, Carrie, nobody will ever climb this high for you,--nobody, except\r\n_somebody_ that loves you very much, and loves you very truly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Injins might, but white men won't, I guess; too stiff in the jints!\"\r\n\r\nAnd again the girl whirled and danced about, as if she had not heard\r\none word he said. Yet she had heard every word, and heeded, too, for her\r\neyes sparkled, and she danced even lighter than before; for her heart\r\nwas light, and the wretched little outcast was--for a rare thing in her\r\nmiserable life--very, very happy.\r\n\r\n\"I ain't stiff in the jints, am I, Johnny?\" and she tapped her ankles.\r\n\r\n\"Carrie, sing me that other song of yours, and that will make my heart\r\nlighter,\" said Johnny.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Johnny, we haven't even got the clouds to overshadow us here;\r\nwe're above the clouds, and everything else. But I'll sing for you if I\r\ncan only make you glad as you was before they got after us.\" And\r\nthrowing back her hair and twisting herself about, looking back over her\r\nshoulder and laughing, looking down at her ragged feet, and making\r\nfaces, she began.\r\n\r\nLike the song of a bird, her voice rang out on the coming night; for it\r\nwas now full twilight, and the leaves quivered overhead; and far up and\r\ndown the mountains the melody floated in a strange, sweet strain, and\r\nwith a touch of tenderness that moved her companions to tears. Logan\r\nstood aside, looking down for Forty-nine a moment, then went to bring\r\nwood for the fire.\r\n\r\nAs her song ended, Carrie turned to the boy; but in doing so her eyes\r\nrested on the empty bottle left by the side of a stone spread with a\r\ntiger skin, by the two men. The boy had his head down, as if still\r\nlistening, and did not observe her. She stopped suddenly, started back,\r\nlooked to see if observed by her brother, and seeing that he was still\r\nabsorbed she advanced, took up the bottle and held it up, glancing back\r\nand up the tree.\r\n\r\n\"Somebody's been here! Somebody's been here, and it's been white men;\r\nthe bottle's empty.\"\r\n\r\nShe hastily hid the bottle, and stepping back and looking up where her\r\nlittle store had been hidden, she only put her finger to her lip, shook\r\nher head on seeing what had happened, and then went and stood by her\r\nlittle brother. Very thoughtful and full of care was she now. All her\r\nmerriment had gone. She stood there as one suddenly grown old.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, thank you, Carrie. It's a pretty song. But what can keep\r\nForty-nine so long?\"\r\n\r\nThe boy rose as he said this, and turning aside looked down the mountain\r\ninto the gathering darkness. The girl stood close beside him, as if\r\nafraid.\r\n\r\n\"He is coming. Far down, I hear Forty-nine's boots on the bowlders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm so glad! And I'm so glad he's got pistols!\" said the girl,\r\neagerly. The two men, who had stepped out, looked at each other as she\r\nsaid this and made signs.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Carrie, are you afraid here! You are all of a tremble!\" said the\r\nboy, as she clung close to him, when they turned back.\r\n\r\n\"Johnny,\" said the girl eagerly, almost wildly, as she looked around,\r\n\"if men were to come to take us to that Reservation, what would you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"What would I do? I would kill 'em! Kill 'em dead, Carrie. I would hold\r\nyou to my heart so, with this arm, and with this I would draw my pistol\r\nso, and kill 'em dead.\"\r\n\r\nThe two heads of the man-hunters disappeared behind the rocks. The boy\r\npushed back the girl's black, tumbled stream of hair from her brow, and\r\nkissing her very tenderly, he went aside and sat down; for he was very,\r\nvery weary.\r\n\r\nA twilight squirrel stole out from the thicket into the clearing and\r\nthen darted back as if it saw something only partly concealed beyond.\r\nThe two children saw this, and looked at each other half alarmed. Then\r\nthe girl, as if to calm the boy--who had grown almost a man in the past\r\nfew weeks--began to talk and chatter as if she had seen nothing,\r\nsuspected nothing.\r\n\r\n\"When the Winter comes, Johnny, we can't stay here; we would starve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Carrie, do the birds starve? Do the squirrels starve? What did God make\r\nus for if we are to starve?\"\r\n\r\nAll this time the two men had been stealing out from their hiding-place,\r\nas if resolved to pounce upon and seize the girl before Forty-nine\r\narrived. The leader had signaled and made signs to his companion back\r\nthere in the gloaming, for they dared not speak lest they should be\r\nheard; and now they advanced stealthily, guns in hand, and now they\r\nfell back to wait a better chance; and just as they were about to\r\nspring upon the two from behind, the snowy white head of old Forty-nine\r\nblossomed above the rocks, and his red face, like a great opening\r\nflower, beamed in upon the little party, while the good-natured old man\r\npuffed and blowed as he fanned himself with his hat and sat down his keg\r\nof provisions. And still he puffed and blowed, as if he would never\r\nagain be able to get his breath. The two men stole back.\r\n\r\n\"And Forty-nine likes to climb the mountains too, don't he? Good for his\r\nhealth. See, what a color he's got! And see how fat he is! Good for your\r\nhealth, ain't it, papa Forty-nine?\"\r\n\r\nBut the good old miner was too hot and puffy to answer, as the merry\r\nlittle girl danced with delight around him.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it makes you blow, don't it? Strange how a little hill like that\r\ncould make a man blow,\" said Johnny, winking at Carrie.\r\n\r\nBut old Forty-nine only drew a long, thin wild flower through his hand,\r\nand looked up now and then to the girl. He beckoned her to approach,\r\nand she came dancing across to where he sat.\r\n\r\n\"It's a sad looking flower, and it's a small one. But, my girl, the\r\nsmallest flower is a miracle. And, Carrie, sometimes the sweetest\r\nflowers grows closest to the ground.\"\r\n\r\nThe man handed her the flower, and was again silent. His face had for a\r\nmoment been almost beautiful. Here Logan came up with a little wood.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, John Logan, what a pretty flower for your button-hole!\" and the\r\nfond girl bounded across and eagerly placed it in the young man's\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\nThe old man on the keg saw this, and his face grew dark. His hands\r\ntwisted nervously, and he could hardly keep his seat on his keg. Then he\r\nhitched up his pants right and left, sat down more resolutely on the keg\r\nthan before, but said nothing for a long time.\r\n\r\nAt last the old man hitched about on his keg, and said sharply, over his\r\nshoulder: \"I saw a track, a boot-track, coming up. On the watch, there!\"\r\n\r\nThe others looked about as if alarmed. It was now dark. Suddenly the two\r\nmen appeared, looking right and left, and smiling villainously. They\r\ncame as if they had followed Forty-nine, and not from behind the rocks,\r\nwhere they had been secreted.\r\n\r\n\"Good evenin', sir! good evenin', sir! Going to rain, eh? Heard it\r\nthunder, and thought best to get shelter. Cattle-men--we're cattle-men,\r\npard and I. Seed your camp-fire, and as it was thunderin,' we came right\r\nin. All right, boss? All right, eh? All right?\" And the man, cap in\r\nhand, bowed from one to the other, as not knowing who was the leader, or\r\nwhom he should address.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" answered Logan. \"You're very welcome. Stand your guns\r\nthere. You're as welcome under these trees as the birds--eh,\r\nForty-nine?\"\r\n\r\nBut Forty-nine was now silent and thoughtful. He was still breathless,\r\nand he only puffed and blowed his answer, and sat down on his keg again\r\nwith all his might.\r\n\r\n\"You must be hungry,\" said the girl kindly, approaching the men.\r\n\r\n\"Heaps of provisions,\" puffed Forty-nine, and again he half arose and\r\nthen sat down on his keg, tighter and harder, if possible, than before.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, gents, thank you. It's hungry we are--eh, pard?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have a spread right off,\" answered the good hearted Logan, now\r\nspreading a rock, which served for a table, with the food; when he\r\nobserved the two men look at the girl and make signs. He looked straight\r\nand hard at the man-hunters for a moment, and seeing them exchange\r\nglances and nod their ill-looking heads at each other he suddenly\r\ndropped his handful of things and started forward. He caught the leader\r\nby the shoulder, and whirling him about as he stood there with his\r\ncompanion leering at the girl, he cried out:\r\n\r\n\"Hunting cattle, are you? What's your brand? What's the brand of your\r\ncattle, I say? I know every brand in Shasta. Now what is your brand?\"\r\n\r\nJohnny had strode up angrily toward the two men, and followed them up as\r\nthey retreated. Old Forty-nine, who now was on the alert, and had his\r\nsleeves rolled up almost to his elbows from the first, had not been\r\nindifferent, but was reaching his tremendous fist towards the\r\nretreating nose of Dosson. Yet it was too dark to distinguish friend\r\nfrom foe.\r\n\r\n\"Why, we are not rich men, stranger. We are poor men, and have but few\r\ncattle, and so, so we have no brand--eh? pardner--eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. We got no brand. Poor men, poor men.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are poor men, with a few cattle that have gone astray. We are\r\nhungry, tired poor men, that have lost their way in the night. Poor men\r\nthat's hungry, and now you want to drive us out into the storm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Forty-nine,--John Logan,--they're poor hungry men!\" interposed\r\nCarrie.\r\n\r\n\"There, there's my hand!\" cried impulsive, honest old Forty-nine.\r\n\"That's enough. You're hungry. Sit down there. And quick, Carrie, pour\r\nus the California wine. Here's a gourd, there's a yeast powder can, and\r\nthere's a tin cup. Thank you. Here's to you. Ah, that sets a fellow all\r\nright. It warms the heart; and, I beg your pardon--it's mean to be\r\nsuspicious. Here, fill us up again. Ah, that's gone just to the spot!\r\nEh, fellows?\"\r\n\r\n\"To the right spot! Keep him a drinkin', and the others, too,\"\r\nwhispered Dosson to Emens.\r\n\r\n\"That's the game!\" And the two villains winked at each other, and\r\nslapped Forty-nine on the back, and laughed, and pretended to be the\r\nbest friend he had in the world.\r\n\r\nThe two men now sat at the table, and Carrie and Johnny bustled about\r\nand helped them as they ate and drank. Meantime Logan went for more wood\r\nto make a light.\r\n\r\n\"And here's the bread, and here's the meat, and--and--that's about all\r\nthere is,\" said the girl at last. Then she stood by and with alarm saw\r\nthe men swallow the last mouthful, and feel about over the table and\r\nlook up to her for more in the dark.\r\n\r\n\"All there is? All gone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and to-morrow, Johnny?\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow, Carrie?\" called out Forty-nine, who was now almost drunk:\r\n\"We've had a good supper, let to-morrow take care of itself. Eh! Let\r\nto-morrow take care of itself! That's my motto--hic--divide the troubles\r\nof the year up into three hundred and sixty-five parts, and take the\r\npieces one at a time. Live one day at a time. That's my philosophy.\" And\r\nthe poor old man, Forty-nine, held his hat high in the air, and began\r\nto hiccough and hold his neck unsteadily.\r\n\r\nThe girl saw this with alarm. As if by accident she placed herself\r\nbetween the men and their guns. Meantime, the two men were trying in\r\nvain to get at the pistols of Forty-nine. They would almost succeed, and\r\nthen, just as they were about to get hold of them, the drunken man would\r\nroll over to the other side or change position. All the time Carrie kept\r\nwishing so devoutly that Logan would come.\r\n\r\n\"Take a drink,\" said one of the men to the girl, reaching out his cup,\r\nafter glancing at his companion. But the girl only shook her head, and\r\nstepped further back. \"Thought you said she was civilized?\" \"She, she is\r\ncivilized; but isn't quite civilized enough to get drunk yet,\"\r\nhiccoughed Forty-nine, as he battered his tin-cup on the table, and\r\nagain foiled the hand just reached for his pistol. The boy saw this, and\r\nstole back through the dark behind his sister. To remove the cap and\r\ntouch his tongue to the tubes of the guns was the work only of a second,\r\nand again he was back by the side of the men. Eagerly all the time the\r\ngirl kept looking over her shoulders into the dark, deep woods, for\r\nLogan. The thunder rolled, and it began to grow very dark. She went up\r\nto Forty-nine, on pretense of helping him to more wine, and whispered\r\nsharply in his ear.\r\n\r\nThe old man only stared at her in helpless wonder. His head rolled from\r\none side to the other like that of an idiot. His wits were utterly under\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as the darkness thickened and the men's actions could hardly be\r\nobserved, one of them pushed the drunken man over, clutched his pistols,\r\nand the two sprang up together.\r\n\r\n\"I've got 'em, Gar,\" cried Emens, and the two started back for their\r\nguns. The girl stood in the way, and Dosson threw his massive body upon\r\nher and bore her to the earth, while the other, awkwardly holding the\r\ntwo pistols in one hand, groped in the dark for their guns.\r\n\r\nThe storm began to beat terribly. The mountains fairly trembled from the\r\nrolling thunder. As the man was about to clutch the guns, he felt rather\r\nthan saw that a tall figure stood between. That instant a flash of\r\nlightning showed John Logan standing there, the boy by his side, and two\r\nugly pistols thrust forward. The man-hunters were unmasked in the fiery\r\nlight of heaven, and Logan knew them for the first time.\r\n\r\n\"I will not kill you.\" He said this with look and action that was grand\r\nand terrible. \"Take your guns and go! Out into the storm! If God can\r\nspare you, I can spare you. Go!\"\r\n\r\nAnd by the lightning's light, the two men, with two ugly pistol-nozzles\r\nin their faces, took their guns and groped and backed down the mountain\r\ninto the darkness, where they belonged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE OLD GOLD-HUNTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"_For the Right! as God has given\r\n      Man to see the Maiden Right!\"\r\n        For the Right, through thickest night,\r\n    Till the man-brute Wrong be driven\r\n        From high places; till the Right\r\n        Shall lift like some grand beacon light._\r\n\r\n    _For the Right! Love, Right and duty;\r\n      Lift the world up, though you fall\r\n        Heaped with dead before the wall;\r\n    God can find a soul of beauty\r\n        Where it falls, as gems of worth\r\n        Are found by miners dark in earth._\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Forty-nine had not cast his life and lot with John Logan at all. Yet\r\nthis singular and contradictory old man stood ready to lay down his\r\nseemingly worthless life at a moment's notice for this boy whom he had\r\nalmost brought up from childhood. But he was not living with him in the\r\nmountains. He had done all he could to protect him, to shelter and feed\r\nhim, all the time. But now the pursuit was so hot and desperate that the\r\nold man, in his sober moments--rare enough, I admit--began to doubt if\r\nit would be possible to save this young man much longer from the\r\nclutches of the Agents. Indeed, it was only by the sweet persuasion of\r\nCarrie that he had this time been induced to go with her and Johnny up\r\non the spur of the mountain, and there meet John Logan with some\r\nprovisions. From there he was persuaded to go with him to his\r\nhiding-place, high up the mountain, where we left him in the last\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nBut the poor old man's head was soon under water again, as we have seen.\r\nThat keg of California wine and the few bits of bread and meat, which so\r\nsuddenly disappeared in the hands of Dosson and Emens, were all he\r\nhappened to have in the cabin when the two children came in at dusk. But\r\nthese he had snatched up at once and ran with them to Logan.\r\n\r\nBut the next morning, when his head was once more above water, and he\r\nhad been told all that had happened, he pulled his long white beard to\r\nthe right and to left, and at last rose up and took the two children and\r\nled them back down the steep and stupendous mountain to his cabin. He\r\nknew that John Logan was now a doomed man. Had he been alone, had there\r\nbeen no one but himself and this hunted man, he would have stayed by his\r\nside. As it was, it made the old man a year older to decide. And it was\r\nlike tearing his heart out by the roots, when he rose up, choking with\r\nagony, grasped Logan's hand, bade him farewell, and led the children\r\nhurriedly away. Once, twice, the old man stopped and turned suddenly\r\nabout, and looked sharply and almost savagely up the mountains, as if to\r\nreturn. And then, each time he sighed, shook his head, and hurried on\r\ndown the hill. He held tightly on to the little brown hands of the\r\nchildren, as if he feared that they, too, like himself, might let their\r\nbetter natures master them, and so turn back and join the desolate and\r\nhunted man.\r\n\r\nThat evening, after the old man had returned from his tunnel, and while\r\nhe prepared a meager meal from a few potatoes and a heel of bacon found\r\nback in the corner of a shelf, and so hard that even the wood-rats had\r\nrefused to eat it, a passing fellow-miner put his heavy head and\r\nshoulders in at the half open cabin and shouted out that a barn had been\r\nburned in the valley, a house fired into, and the tomahawk of John Logan\r\nfound hard by. The children glanced at each other by the low fire-light.\r\nBut old Forty-nine only went on with his work as the head withdrew and\r\npassed on, but he said never a word. He was very thoughtful all the\r\nevening. He was now perfectly certain that his course had been the wise\r\none, the only prudent one in fact. Logan he knew was now beyond help. He\r\nmust use all his art and address to keep the children from further\r\nperil. He made them promise to remain in his cabin, to never attempt to\r\nreach Logan. He told them that their presence with him would only\r\ngreatly embarrass him in his flight; that they might be followed if they\r\nattempted to reach him, and that he and they would then be taken and\r\nsent to the Reservation together. But he told them further--and their\r\nblack eyes flashed like fire as he spoke in a voice tremulous with\r\nemotion and earnestness--that if ever Logan came to that cabin hungry,\r\nor for help of any kind, they should help him with every means in their\r\npower.\r\n\r\nAnd so the old man went back to work in his tunnel; and as the autumn\r\nwore away and winter drew on, the children kept close about the little\r\nold cabin, waiting, waiting, waiting; looking up toward the now white,\r\ncold mountain, yet obeying Forty-nine to the letter.\r\n\r\nMeantime the man-hunt went on; although the children knew nothing for a\r\nlong time of the deadly energy with which it was conducted.\r\n\r\nWhat a strange place for two bright, budding children was this old, old\r\ncabin, with its old, old man, and its dark and miserable interior! How\r\npeople shunned the lonely old place, and how it sank down into the earth\r\nand among the weeds and willows, and long strong yellow tangled grass,\r\nas if it wanted to be shunned!\r\n\r\nOn a dirty old shelf near the fire-place lay a torn and tattered book.\r\nIt was thumbed and thrumbed all to pieces from long and patient use.\r\nWhen the wind blew through the chinks of the cabin, this old book seemed\r\nto have life. It fluttered there like a wounded bird. Its leaves\r\nliterally whispered. This old book was a Bible.\r\n\r\nMore houses had been burned in the little valley, and the crime laid to\r\nJohn Logan. He had now been proclaimed an outlaw in effect by every\r\nsettler. Those two men had made him so odious that many settlers had\r\nvowed to shoot him on sight. Dosson at last went before a magistrate and\r\nswore that John Logan had shot at him while in the performance of his\r\nduty as a sub-agent of the Reservation. By this means he procured a\r\nwarrant for his arrest by the civil authorities, to be placed in the\r\nhands of the newly elected sheriff of the newly organized and sparsely\r\nsettled country. Things looked desperate indeed. To add to the agony of\r\nthe crisis, a sharp and bitter winter now wrapped the whole world in\r\nsnow and ice. It was no longer possible for any one to subsist in the\r\nmountains, or survive at all without fire and fire-arms. These the\r\nhunted man did not dare use. They were witnesses that would betray his\r\npresence, and must not be thought of.\r\n\r\nAll this time the old man and the children could do nothing. The\r\nchildren hovered over the fire in the wretched old cabin. And what a\r\ncold, cheerless place it was!\r\n\r\nBut if the interior of this old cabin was gloomy, that of the old tunnel\r\nwas simply terrible. Yet in this dark and dreadful place the old man had\r\nspent nearly a quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nI wonder if the glad, gay world knows where it gets its gold? Does that\r\nfair woman, or well-clad, well-fed man, know anything about the life of\r\nthe gold-hunter? When the gold is brought to the light and given to the\r\ncommerce of the world, we see it shining in the sun. It is now a part of\r\nthe wealth of the nation. But do not forget that every piece of gold you\r\ntouch or see, or stand credited with at your bank, cost some brave man\r\nblood, life!\r\n\r\nThis old Forty-nine, years before, when the camp was young, had found a\r\npiece of gold-bearing quartz in a ledge on the top of a high, sharp\r\nridge, that pointed down into the canyon. This was before quartz mining\r\nhad been thought of. But the shrewd, thoughtful man saw that from this\r\nsource came all the gold in the placer. He could see that it was from\r\nthis vein that all the fine gold in the camp had been fed. He resolved\r\nto strike at the fountain head. It was by accident he had made his\r\ndiscovery. The high, sharp and narrow ridge was densely timbered, and\r\nnow that the miners had settled in the canyon below, the annual fires\r\nwould not be allowed to sweep over the country, and the woods would soon\r\nbe almost impenetrable. So argued Forty-nine. For all his mind was bent\r\non keeping his secret till he could pierce the mountains from the\r\ncanyon-level below, and strike the ledge in the heart of the great\r\nhigh-backed ridge, where he felt certain the gold must lay in great\r\nheaps and flakes and wedges. And so it was with a full heart and a\r\nstrong arm that he had begun his low, dark tunnel--all alone at the\r\nbottom of the ridge.\r\n\r\nHe had begun his tunnel in a secluded place, under a tuft of dense wood,\r\non the steep hillside. He made the mouth of the tunnel very low and\r\nnarrow. At first he wheeled out the dirt in his wheelbarrow only when\r\nthe water in the canyon was high enough to carry off the earth which he\r\nexcavated. He worked very hard and kept very sober for a long time. Day\r\nafter day he expected to strike the ledge.\r\n\r\nBut day after day, week after week, month after month, stole away\r\nbetween his fingers, and still no sign of the ledge. A year went by.\r\nThen he struck a hard wall of granite. This required drills,\r\nfuse-powder, and all the appliance of the quarry. He had to stop work\r\nnow and then and wash in the fast failing placers, to get money enough\r\nto continue his tunnel. Besides, he now could make only a few inches\r\nheadway each week. Sometimes he would be a whole month making the length\r\nof his pick-handle.\r\n\r\nAll this was discouraging. The man began to grow heart-sick. Who was\r\nthere at home waiting and waiting all this time? No one in the camp\r\ncould say. In fact, no one in the camp knew any thing at all about this\r\nsilent man, who seemed so superior to them all; and as the camp knew\r\nnothing at all of the man, either his past or his present, as is usually\r\nthe case, it made a history of its own for him. And you may be certain\r\nit was not at all complimentary to this exclusive and silent man of the\r\ntunnel.\r\n\r\nTwo, three, four, five years passed. The camp had declined; miners had\r\neither gone back to the States, gone to new mines, or gone up on the\r\nlittle hill out of the canyon to rest together; and yet this man held on\r\nto his tunnel. He was a little bit bent now from long stooping, waiting,\r\ntoiling, and there were ugly crows-feet about his eyes--eyes that had\r\ngrown dim and blood-shot from the five years glare of the single candle\r\nin that tunnel.\r\n\r\nAnd the man was not so exclusive now. The tunnel was now no secret. It\r\nwas spoken of now with derision, only to be laughed at.\r\n\r\nSix, seven, eight, nine, ten years! The man has grown old. He is bent\r\nand gray. But his faith, which the few remaining miners call a madness,\r\nis still unbroken. Yet it is not in human nature to endure all this\r\nagony of suspense, all this hope deferred from day to day, week to week,\r\nmonth to month, year to year, and still be human. The man has, in some\r\nsense, become a brute. He now is seen to reel and totter to his cabin,\r\nlate at night oftentimes. He has at last fallen into the habit of the\r\ncamp. He can drink, gamble, carouse, as late as the latest.\r\n\r\nNow and then, it is true, he has his sober spells, and all the good of\r\nhis great nature is to the surface. Now he takes up a map and diagram\r\nwhich is hidden under the broad stone of the hearth, and examines it,\r\nmeasures and makes calculations by the hour at night, when all the camp\r\nis, or ought to be, asleep.\r\n\r\nMaybe it is the placing and displacing of this great stone that has\r\ngiven rise to the story in the camp that the old man is not so poor as\r\nhe pretends. Maybe some of the rough men who hang about the camp have\r\nwatched him through the chink-holes in the wretched cabin some night,\r\nand decided that it is gold which he keeps concealed under the great\r\nhearthstone.\r\n\r\nEleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen years! The man's hair is\r\nlong and hangs in strings. It is growing gray, almost white. Some men\r\nhave been trying to get into the bent old man's cabin at night to find\r\nthe buried treasure. The old man's double-barreled shot-gun has barked\r\nin their faces; and there has been a thinly attended funeral. The camp\r\nis low, miserable. The tide is out. Wrecks of rockers, toms, sluices,\r\nflumes, derricks, battered pans, tom-irons, cradles, old cabin, strew\r\nthe sandy strand.\r\n\r\nThis last act has left the old man utterly alone; yet he is seen even\r\nmore frequently than before at the \"Deadfall.\" Is he trying to forget\r\nthat man had died at his hand?\r\n\r\nNow and then you see him leading a tawny boy about, and talking in a\r\nlow, tender way of better things than his life and appearance would\r\nindicate. The man is still on the down grade. And yet how long he has\r\nbeen on this decline! One would say he should be at the bottom by this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect how very far a man can fall, we can estimate something\r\nof the height in which he stands when fresh from his Maker's hand.\r\n\r\nSixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one years! The\r\niron-gray hair is white as the snow on the mountain-tops that environ\r\nhim. The tall man is bent as a tree is bent when the winter snow lies\r\nheavily on its branches. The tawny boy is grown a man now. This is John\r\nLogan, the fugitive. The two homeless children have long since taken his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nAnd still the pick clangs on in that dark, damp tunnel that is always\r\ndripping, dripping, dripping, where it looks out at the glaring day, as\r\nif in eternal tears for the wasted life within. Yet now there is hope.\r\n\r\nNew life has been infused into this old camp of late years. The tide is\r\nflowing in. The placer mines have perished and passed into history. But\r\nthere is a new industry discovered. It is quartz mining--the very thing\r\nthat this old man has given his life to establish. And it is this that\r\nhas kept the old man up, alive, for the past few years. He is now\r\ncertain that he will strike it yet.\r\n\r\nIs there some one waiting still, far away? We do not know. He does not\r\nknow now. Years and years ago, utterly discouraged, yet mechanically\r\nkeeping on, he ceased to write.\r\n\r\nBut now these two new lives here have ran into his. If he could only\r\nstrike it now! If he could only strike it for them!\r\n\r\nIt is mid-winter. The three are almost starving. Old Forty-nine has been\r\nprudent, cautious, careful of the two helpless waifs thrown into his\r\nhands. Could he, old, broken, destitute, friendless, stand up boldly\r\nbetween the man-hunters and these children? Impossible. And so it is\r\nthat Dosson and Emens are not strangers at the old man's cabin now,\r\nhateful as is their presence there to all. They are allowed to come and\r\ngo. And Dosson pays court to Carrie. They ply the old man with drink.\r\nThe poor, broken, brave old miner, still dreams and hopes that he will\r\nstrike it yet--and then! Sometimes he starts up in his sleep and strikes\r\nout with his bony hands--as if to expel them from his cabin and keep\r\nCarrie safe, sacred, pure. Then he sinks back with a groan, and Carrie\r\nbends over him and her great eyes fill with tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPTURE.\r\n\r\n    _O, the mockery of pity!\r\n    Weep with fragrant handkerchief,\r\n    In pompous luxury of grief,\r\n    Selfish, hollow-hearted city?_\r\n\r\n    _O these money-getting times!\r\n    What's a heart for? What's a hand,\r\n    But to seize and shake the land,\r\n    Till it tremble for its crimes?_\r\n\r\n\r\nMidnight, and the mighty trees knock their naked arms together, and\r\ncreak and cry wildly in the wind. In Forty-nine's cabin, by a flickering\r\nlog-fire, Carrie sits alone. The wind howls horribly, the door creaks,\r\nand the fire snaps wickedly; the wind roars--now the roar of a far-off\r\nsea, and now it smites the cabin in shocks, and sifts and shakes the\r\nsnow through the shingle. The girl draws her tattered blanket tighter\r\nabout her, and sits a little closer to the fire. Now there is a sudden,\r\nsavage gust of wind, wilder, fiercer than before, and a sheet of snow\r\nsifts in through a crack in the door, and dances over the floor.\r\n\r\n\"What a storm!\" exclaims the girl, as she rises up, looks about, and\r\nthen takes the blanket from her shoulders and stuffs it in the crack by\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nShe listens, looks about again, and then, going up to the little glass\r\ntacked beside the fire-place, carefully arranges her splendid hair that\r\ndroops down over her shoulders in the careless, perfect fashion of\r\nEvangeline.\r\n\r\n\"Heaven help any one who is out in this storm to-night!\"\r\n\r\nThen she takes another stick from the corner and places it on the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Forty-nine will be here soon, and Johnny; Johnny with news about\r\nhim--about poor John Logan.\"\r\n\r\nShe shakes her head and clasps her hands.\r\n\r\n\"It is nearly half a year since that night. They can't take him--they\r\ndare not take him. They are hunting him--hunting him in this\r\nstorm--hunting him as if he were a wild beast. He hides with the cattle\r\nin the sheds, with the very hogs in their pens. They come upon him\r\nthere; he starts from his sleep and dashes away, while they follow, and\r\ntrack him by the blood of his feet in the snow. Oh, how terrible it is!\r\nI must not think of it; I will go mad.\"\r\n\r\nShe turns to the door and listens. She draws back the ragged curtains\r\nfrom the window and tries to look out into the storm. She can hear and\r\nsee nothing, and she walks back again to the fire. \"I must set them\r\ntheir supper.\" As she says this, she goes to a little cupboard and takes\r\na piece of bread, puts it on a plate and sets it on the table. Then she\r\nplaces two plates and two cups of water. \"They will be here soon, and\r\nthey must have their suppers. Oh, that grocery!\" She shudders as she\r\nsays this. \"And Johnny will bring me news of him--of John Logan. What's\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\nShe springs to the door, lifts the latch, and Stumps steals in, brushing\r\nthe snow from his neck and shoulders. He has a club in his hand, and\r\nlooks back and about him as he shuts the door.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sister, its awful! I tell you its too awful!\"\r\n\r\n\"Brother--brother! What has happened? What is awful? What is it,\r\nJohnny? And he, John Logan?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's been there!\" The boy shivers and points in a half-frightened\r\nmanner toward the little hill. \"Yes, he has; he's been up on the hill by\r\nhis mother's grave; and he's been to 'Squire Field's house--yes, he has;\r\nand he couldn't get in, for they had a big dog tied to the gate, and now\r\nthey have got another dog tied to the gate. Yes, and they tracked him\r\nall around by the blood in the snow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh brother! don't, don't!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be afraid, sister; he has gone away now. Oh, if he would only go\r\naway and stay away--far away, and they couldn't catch him, I'd be just\r\nas glad as I could be! Yes, I would; so help me, I would.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he has been up there, and in this storm!\"\r\n\r\nShe speaks this to herself, as she goes to the window and attempts to\r\nlook out.\r\n\r\n\"Poor, poor John Logan!\" sighs the boy. \"I wish his mother was alive; I\r\ndo, so help me. She was a good woman, she was; she didn't sick Bose on\r\nme, she didn't.\"\r\n\r\nAs the boy says this he stands his club in the corner, and looks with\r\nhis sister for a moment sadly into the fire, and then suddenly says:\r\n\r\n\"I'm hungry. Sister, ain't you got something to eat. Forty-nine, he's\r\ndown to the grocery, and Phin Emens he's down to the grocery, too, and\r\nhe swears awfully about John Logan, and he says it's the Injun that's in\r\nhim that makes him so bad. Do you think it's the Injun that's in him,\r\nsister?\"\r\n\r\nAs the boy says this, the girl turns silently to the little table and\r\npushes it toward him.\r\n\r\n\"There, Johnny, that's all there is. You must leave some for\r\nForty-nine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor, poor John Logan!\"\r\n\r\nHe eats greedily for a moment, then stops suddenly and looks into the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nCarrie, also looking into the fire, murmurs:\r\n\r\n\"And Sylvia Fields let them tie a dog there to keep him away! I would\r\nhave killed that dog first. If John Logan should come here, I would open\r\nthat door--I would open that door to him!\"--There is a dark and\r\nterrified face at the window--\"And I would give him bread to eat, and\r\nlet him sit by this fire and get warm!\"\r\n\r\n\"And I would, too--so help me, I would!\" The boy pushes back his bread,\r\nand rises and goes up to his sister. \"Yes, I would. I don't care what\r\nPhin Emens, or anybody says; for his mother didn't sick 'Bose' at me,\r\nshe didn't!\"\r\n\r\nThe pale and pitiful face at the window begins to brighten. There is\r\nsnow in the long matted black locks that fall to his shoulders. For\r\nnearly half a year this man has fled from his fellow-man, a hunted\r\ngrizzly, a hunted tiger of the jungle.\r\n\r\nWhat wonder that his step is stealthy as he lifts the latch and enters?\r\nWhat wonder that his eyes have an uncommon glare as he looks around,\r\nlooks back over his shoulder as he shuts the door noiselessly behind\r\nhim? What wonder that his clothes hang in shreds about him, and his feet\r\nand legs are bound in thongs; that his arms are almost bare; that his\r\nbloodless face is half hidden in black and shaggy beard?\r\n\r\n\"Carrie, I have come to you. Yours is the only door that will open to me\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"John Logan!\" She starts; the boy, too, utters a low, stifled cry. Then\r\nthey draw near the miserable man. For they are bred of the woods, and\r\nhave nerves of iron, and they know the need and the power of silence,\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n\"_You_ here, John Logan?\" Carrie whispers, with a shudder.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, I am here--starving, dying!\"\r\n\r\nThe boy takes up the bread he had dropped, and places it on the table\r\nbefore Logan. The hunted outcast sits down wearily and begins to eat\r\nwith the greediness of a starved beast. The girl timidly brushes the\r\nsnow from his hair, and takes a pin from her breast and begins to pin up\r\na great rent in his shirt that shows his naked shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe boy is glad and full of heart, and of indescribable delight that he\r\nhas given his bread to the starving man. He stands up, brightly, with\r\nhis back to the fire for a moment, and then goes back and brushes off\r\nthe snow from the man's matted hair, then back to the fire.\r\n\r\n\"I'm awful glad to see you eat, Mr. John Logan,\" says Stumps; \"I wish\r\nthere was more, I do,\" and he rocks on his foot and wags his head from\r\nshoulder to shoulder gleefully. \"It ain't much--it ain't much, Mr. John\r\nLogan; but it is all there is.\"\r\n\r\n\"All there is, and they were eating it.\" The man says this aside to\r\nhimself, and he hides his face for a moment, as if he would conceal a\r\ntear. Then, after a time he seems to recover himself, and he lays the\r\nbread down on the table, tenderly, silently, carefully indeed, as if it\r\nwere the most delicate and precious thing on earth. Then, lifting his\r\nface, looks at them with an effort to be cheerful, and says:\r\n\r\n\"I--I forgot; I--I am not hungry. I have had my dinner. I--I, oh yes; I\r\nhave been eating a great deal. Oh, no, no, no; I'm not hungry--not\r\nhungry!\"\r\n\r\nAs the man says this he rises and stands between the others at the fire.\r\nHe puts his hands over their heads, and looks alternately in their\r\nuplifted faces. There is a long silence. \"Carrie, they have tied a dog\r\nto that door, over yonder.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no dog tied to this door, John Logan.\"\r\n\r\nLow and tender with love, yet very firm and earnest is her voice. And\r\nher eyes are lifted to his. He looks down into her soul, and there is an\r\nunderstanding between them. There is a conversation of the eyes too\r\nrefined for words; too subtle, too sweet, too swift for words.\r\n\r\nThey stand together but a moment there, soul flowing into soul and\r\ntiding forth, and to and fro; but it was as if they had talked together\r\nfor hours. He leans his head, kisses her lifted and unresisting lips,\r\nand says, \"God bless you,\" and that is all.\r\n\r\nIt is her first kiss, the imprint, the mint-mark on this virgin gold.\r\nThis maiden of a moment since, is a woman now.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know that they are after you?\" The girl says this in a sort of\r\nwild whisper, as she looks toward the door.\r\n\r\n\"Do I know that they are after me? Father in Heaven, who should know it\r\nbetter than I?\" The man throws up his arms, and totters back and falls\r\ninto a seat from very weakness. \"Do I know that they are after me? For\r\nmore than half a year I have fled; night and day, and day and night I\r\nhave fled, hidden away; starting up at midnight from down among the\r\ncattle, where I had crept to keep warm; and then on, on and on, out into\r\nthe snow, the storm, over the frozen ground, to the deep canyon and dark\r\nwoods, where, naked and bleeding, I disputed with the bear for his bed\r\nin the hollow tree.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy springs to the door. Is it the storm that is tugging and\r\nrattling at the latch?\r\n\r\nBut the girl seems to see, to heed, to hear only John Logan. She\r\nclutches his hand in both her own and covers it with kisses and with\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\"John Logan, I pity you! I--I--\" she had almost said, \"I love you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank Heaven! Thank Heaven for one true heart, and one true hand when\r\nall the world is against me! Carrie, I could die now content. The\r\nbitterness of my heart passes away, and the wild, mad nature that made\r\nme an Ishmaelite, with every man's hand against me, and my hand against\r\nall, is gone. I am another being. I could die now content;\" and he bows\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n\"But you must not, you shall not die! You must go--go far away; why\r\nhover about this place?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know. But yonder lies the only being who ever befriended me;\r\nand somehow I get lonesome when I get far away from her grave. And I go\r\nround and round, like the sun around the world, and come back to where I\r\nstarted from.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you must go--go far away--go now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what you are saying? I was never outside of this. All would\r\nbe strange. I would be lost, lost there. And then, do you not imagine\r\nthey are waiting for me there--everywhere? Look at my face! This tinge\r\nof Indian blood, that all men abhor and fear, and call treacherous and\r\nbloody. Across my brow at my birth was drawn a brand that marks me\r\nforever--a brand--a brand as if it were the brand of Cain.\"\r\n\r\nThe man bows his head, and turns away.\r\n\r\nSlowly and timidly Carrie approaches him, and she lays her hand on his\r\narm and looks in his face. The boy still watches by the door.\r\n\r\n\"But you will fly from here?\"\r\n\r\nHis arm drops over her hair, down to her shoulder, and he draws her to\r\nhis breast, as she looks up tenderly in his face, and pleads:\r\n\r\n\"You will go now--at once? For you will die here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I will die here.\" He says this with a calm and dogged\r\ndetermination. \"Carrie, I have one wish, one request--only one. I know\r\nyou are weak and helpless yourself, and can't do much, and I ought not\r\nto ask you to do anything.\"\r\n\r\nStumps has left the door as he hears the man mention that there is\r\nsomething to be done, and stands by their side.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever it is you ask, John Logan, we will do it--we will do it.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl says this with a firmness that convinces him that it will be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\"We will do it! we will do it! so help me, we will do it!\" blubbers\r\nStumps.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, John Logan, we can do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not fly from here.\" He looks down tenderly into their faces.\r\nThen he lifts his face. It is dark and terrible, and his lips are set\r\nwith resolution. \"I will die here. It may be to-night, it may be\r\nto-morrow. It may be as I turn to go out at that door they will send\r\ntheir bullets through my heart; it may be while I kneel in the snow at\r\nmy mother's grave. But, sooner or later, it will come--it will come!\"\r\n\r\n\"But please, John Logan, what is it we can do?\"\r\n\r\nHer voice is tremulous, and her eyes stream with tears.\r\n\r\n\"Carrie, I am a man--a strong man--and ought not to ask anything of a\r\nhelpless girl. But I have no other friend. I have had no friends. All\r\nthe days of my life have been dark and lonely. And now I am about to\r\ndie, Carrie, I want you to see that I am buried by my mother yonder. I\r\nam so weary, and I could rest there. And then she, poor broken-hearted\r\nmother, she might not be so lonesome then. Do you promise?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do promise!\" and the boy echoes this scarcely audible but determined\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you--thank you! And now good night. I must be going, lest I draw\r\nsuspicion on you. Good night, good night; God bless you, Carrie!\"\r\n\r\nHe presses her to his heart, hastily embraces her, and tearing himself\r\naway, stoops and kisses the boy as he passes to the door. Drawing his\r\ntattered shirt closer about his shoulders, and turning his face as if to\r\nconceal his emotion, he lays his hand upon the latch to suddenly dart\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nTwo dark figures pass the window, and in a moment more the latch-string\r\nis clutched by a rough, unsteady hand from without.\r\n\r\n\"Here, here!\" cries the girl, as she springs back to the dingy curtain\r\nthat divides off a portion of the cabin into a bed-room. \"Here! in here!\r\nQuick! quick!\" as she draws the curtain aside, and lets it fall over the\r\nretreating fugitive. Forty-nine and Gar Dosson enter. The former is\r\ndrunk, and therefore dignified and silent. His companion is drunk, and\r\ntherefore garrulous and familiar. Wine floats a man's real nature nearly\r\nto the surface.\r\n\r\nForty-nine lifts his hat, bows politely and respectfully to the\r\nchildren, brushes his hat with his elbow as he meanders across the floor\r\nto the peg in the wall, but cannot quite trust himself to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, Carats!\" cries Gar Dosson, as he chucks her under the chin.\r\n\"Knowed I was coming, didn't you? Got yourself fixed up. Pretty, ain't\r\nshe?\" and he winks a blood-shot eye toward Stumps. \"And when is it going\r\nto be my Carats? Pretty soon, now, eh?\" and he walks, or rather totters,\r\naside.\r\n\r\n\"Umph! I have got 'em again, Carrie. Fly around and get us something to\r\neat. Fly around, Carrie, fly around! Oh, I've got the shakes again!\"\r\ngroans Forty-nine.\r\n\r\n\"Poor old boy!\" and she brushes the snow from his beard and his tattered\r\ncoat. \"Why, Forty-nine, you're shaking like a leaf.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's drunk--that's what's the matter with him.\" Gar Dosson growls this\r\nout between his teeth as he sets his gun in the corner.\r\n\r\n\"He's not drunk! Its the ager!\" retorts Stumps fiercely.\r\n\r\nGar Dosson, glaring at the boy, steadies himself on his right leg, and\r\ndiving deep in his left hand pocket, draws forth a large bill or poster.\r\nWith both hands he manages to spread this out, and swaggering up to the\r\nwall near the window he hangs it on two pegs that are there to receive\r\ncoats or hats.\r\n\r\n\"Look at that!\" and he crookedly points with his crooked fingers at the\r\nlarge letters, and reads: \"One thousand dollars (hic) dollars reward\r\nfor the capture of John Logan! What do you say to that, Carats? That's a\r\nfine fellow to have for a lover, now, ain't it?--a waluable lover, now,\r\nain't it? Worth a thousand dollars! Oh, don't I wish he was a-hanging\r\naround here now! Wouldn't I sell him, and get a thousand dollars, eh?\r\nYes, I would. I just want that thousand dollars. And I'm the man that's\r\ngoing to get it, too! Eh, old Blossom-nose?\" Forty-nine jerks back his\r\ndignified head as the bully gesticulates violently.\r\n\r\n\"You will, will you? Well, may-be you will (hic), but if you get a cent\r\nof that money (hic) for catching that man you don't enter that door\r\nagain; no, you don't lift that latch-string again as long as old\r\nForty-nine has a fist to lift!\" and he thrusts his doubled hand hard\r\ninto the boaster's face.\r\n\r\n\"Good for you!\" cries Carrie. \"Dear, good, brave old Forty-nine; I like\r\nyou--I love you!\" and the girl embraces him, while the boy flourishes\r\nhis club at the back of the bully.\r\n\r\n\"No, don't you hit a man when he's down, sah,\" continues Forty-nine.\r\n\"That's the true doctrine of a gentleman--the true doctrine of a\r\ngentleman, sah.\" He flourishes his hand, totters forward, totters back,\r\nand hesitates--\"The true doctrine of a gentleman, sah. The little horse\r\nin the horse-race, sah--the bottom dog in the dog-fight, sah. The--\"\r\n\r\nAnd the poor old man totters back and falls helplessly in the great,\r\nhome-made chair near the corner, where stands the gun. His head is under\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"The true doctrines of a gentleman,\" snaps Dosson; and he throws out a\r\nbig hand toward the drooping head. \"Old Blossom-nose!\" Then turning to\r\nCarrie. \"The sheriff's a coming; he gave me that 'ere bill--yes, he did.\r\nHe's down to the grocery, now. He's going around to all the cabins, and\r\na-swearing 'em in a book, that they don't know nothing about John Logan.\r\nThe sheriff, he's a comin' here, Carats, right off.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a rift in the curtain, and the pitiful face of the fugitive\r\npeers forth.\r\n\r\n\"The sheriff coming here!\" He turns, feels the wall, and tries the logs\r\nwith his hands. Not a door, not a window. Solid as the solid earth.\r\n\r\n\"Coming here? But what is he coming here for?\" demands Carrie.\r\n\r\n\"Coming here to find out what you know about John Logan. Oh, he's close\r\nafter him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Close after me!\" gasps Logan. The man feels for something to lay hand\r\nupon by which to defend himself. \"I will not be taken alive; I will die\r\nhere!\" He clutches at last, above the bed, a gun. \"Saved, saved!\" He\r\nholds it tenderly, as if a child, or something dearly loved. He takes it\r\nto the light and looks at the lock; he blows in the barrel; he\r\nmournfully shakes his head. \"It is not loaded! Well, no matter; I can\r\nbut die,\" and he clubs the gun and prepares for mortal battle.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come, Carats,\" cries Gar Dosson, \"let's have a little frolic before\r\nthe sheriff comes--a kiss, eh? Come, my beauty!\"\r\n\r\nThe rough man has all this time been stealing up, as nearly as he could\r\nto the girl, and now throws his arm about her neck.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I brain him--be a murderer, indeed?\"\r\n\r\nAll the Indian is again aroused, and John Logan seems more terrible, and\r\nmore determined to save her than to defend his own life.\r\n\r\n\"Stand back!\" shouts the Girl to Dosson. She attempts to throw him off,\r\nbut his powerful arm is about her neck. \"Forty-nine! Help!\" but the old\r\nman is unconscious. John Logan is about to start from his corner.\r\n\r\n\"Take that, you brute! and that!\" and Stumps whirls his club and\r\nthunders against the ribs of the ruffian.\r\n\r\n\"You devil! you brat! what do you mean?\"\r\n\r\nMad with disappointment and pain, he throws the girl from him, and turns\r\nupon the boy. He clutches him by the back of the neck as he starts to\r\nescape, and bears him to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Look 'ere, do you know what I'm going to do with you? I'm going to\r\nbreak your back across my knee! yes, I am!\" and he glares about\r\nterribly.\r\n\r\nCarrie shrinks back to the side of Forty-nine.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Help! He will murder him! He will kill him!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I won't murder you, you brat, but I'll chuck you out in that snow\r\nand let you cool off, while I have your sister all to myself. Come here;\r\ngive me your ear!\" and the great, strong ruffian seizes his ear and\r\nfairly carries him along by it toward the door. \"Give me your ear!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sister, sister! He will kill me!\" howls Stumps.\r\n\r\n\"Forty-nine! save us! We will be murdered!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, I say, give me your ear!\" thunders the brute, as he fairly draws\r\nthe boy still toward the door.\r\n\r\n\"Stop that, or die!\"\r\n\r\nThe frenzied girl, failing to arouse Forty-nine, has caught up the gun\r\nfrom the corner, and brought the muzzle to the ruffian's breast. He\r\ntotters back, and throws up his arms.\r\n\r\n\"Go back there and sit down, or I will kill you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me your ear! Come!\" roars Stumps. It is now his turn. \"Give me\r\nyour ear!\" He reaches up and takes that red organ in his hand, and\r\nnearly wrenches it from the brute's head, as he leads him back, with\r\nmany twists and gyrations, slowly to a low seat at the other side of the\r\ncabin.\r\n\r\nStill holding the gun in level, and in dangerous proximity to the man's\r\nbreast, Carrie cries:\r\n\r\n\"Now if you attempt to move you are a dead man!\" \"Give me your ear!\" and\r\nStumps wrenches it again, as he sits the man firmly on his low stool,\r\nwith his red face making mad distortions from the pain. \"John Logan,\r\ncome!\" calls the girl. \"No, don't you start, Gar Dosson. Don't you lift\r\na finger; if you do, you die!\"\r\n\r\nThe curtains are parted, and John Logan starts forth. \"Go, go! There's\r\nnot a moment to lose. The sheriff will be here; they are coming! Quick!\r\nGo at once! I hear--I hear them coming!\"\r\n\r\nThe man springs to the door; the latch is lifted; a moment more and he\r\nwill be free--safe, at least for the night. Out into the friendly\r\ndarkness, where man and beast, where pursuer and pursued, are equal, and\r\nequally helpless.\r\n\r\nThere is a crushing of snow, a stamping of feet, and one, two, three,\r\nfour, five--five forms hurriedly pass the window. The latch is lifted,\r\nand as John Logan again darts back under cover, the party, brushing the\r\nsnow from their coats and grizzled beards, hastily enter the cabin.\r\n\r\n\"Fly around, Carrie, fly around! fix yourself up!\" The fresh gust of\r\nwind and storm from the door just opened, fans the glimmering spark of\r\nconsciousness into sudden flame, and Forty-nine springs up, perfectly\r\nerect, perfectly dignified. \"Fly around, Carrie, fly around; fix\r\nyourself up. The sheriff is coming--fly around!\"\r\n\r\nThe girl drops the gun in the corner where she had found it, and stands\r\nbefore Forty-nine, smoothing down her apron, and letting her eyes fall\r\non the floor timidly and in a childlike way, as if these little hands of\r\nhers had never known a harder task than their present employment of\r\nsmoothing down her apron.\r\n\r\nDosson springs up before the sheriff. He rubs his eyes, and he looks\r\nabout as if he had just been startled from some bad, ugly dream. He\r\nwonders, indeed, if he has seen John Logan at all. Again he rubs his\r\neyes, and then, looking at his knuckle, says, in a deep, guttural\r\nfashion, to himself, \"Jim-jams, by gol! I thought I'd seed John Logan!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Forty-nine,\" says the sheriff, \"sorry to disturb you, and your\r\nMiss; and good evening to you, sir; and good evening to you;\" and the\r\nhonest sheriff bows to each, and brushes the snow from his fur cap as he\r\nspeaks.\r\n\r\nGar Dosson advances to his partner, Phin Emens, who has just entered,\r\nwith that stealthy old tiger-step so familiar to them both, and laying\r\nhis hand on his shoulder, they move aside.\r\n\r\n\"Then it's not the jim-jams,\" mutters he. \"I've not got 'em, then.\"\r\n\r\nHe stops, pinches himself, looks at his hands, and mutters to himself.\r\nThen he lifts his hand to his ear.\r\n\r\n\"Look at it again!\" Phin Emens looks at the ear. \"It's red, ain't it?\r\nOh, it feels red; it feels like fire. Then I've not got 'em, and he is\r\nhere. Hist! Come here! We want that thousand dollars all to ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nHe plucks his companion further to one side. They talk and gesticulate\r\ntogether, while now and then a big red rough hand is thrust out savagely\r\ntoward the curtain.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry indeed to disturb you, Miss,\" observes the sheriff; \"but you see,\r\nI've been searching and swearing of 'em all, and its only fair to serve\r\nall alike.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is not here. Upon the honor of a gentleman, he is not here,\" says\r\nForty-nine, emphatically.\r\n\r\n\"He is here!\" howls Dosson; and the tremendous man, with the tremendous\r\nvoice and tremendous manner, bolts up before the sheriff. \"He is here;\r\nand I, as an honest man am going to earn a thousand dollars, for the\r\nsake of justice. I have found him--found him all by myself; and these\r\nfellers can't have no hand in my find.\" And he holds up John Logan's\r\ncap, which had been knocked from his head in his hasty retreat to cover,\r\nand he rolls his red eyes toward the bed, takes a step in that\r\ndirection, reaches a hand, lays hold of the curtain, and is about to\r\ndash it aside.\r\n\r\n\"John Logan is there!\" shouts Dosson, and again the curtain is clutched.\r\n\r\nDoes he dream of what is beyond? If he could only see the panting,\r\nbreathless wretch that leans there eagerly, with lifted gun, ready to\r\nbrain him--waiting, waiting for him to come, even wishing that he only\r\nwould come--he would start back with terror to the other side.\r\n\r\n\"He is here! I have found him! Come!\"\r\n\r\nCarrie, springing forward from her posture of anxiety and terror, grasps\r\na powder horn from over the mantel piece, jerks out the stopple with her\r\nteeth, and holding it over the fire, cries, with desperation:\r\n\r\n\"Do it, if you dare! This horn is full of powder, and if any man here\r\ndares to move that curtain, I'll blow you all into burning hell!\" The\r\nman loosens his hold on the curtain, and totters back. He is sober\r\nenough to know how terrible is the situation, and he knows her well\r\nenough to believe she will do precisely what she says she will do. \"Yes,\r\nI will! We will all go to the next world together; and now let us see\r\nwho is best ready to die!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo!\" shouts Forty-nine.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff and his men have been moving back slowly from the inspired\r\ngirl, standing there by the door of death.\r\n\r\nGar Dosson at last steals around by the sheriff. \"But he is here, Mr.\r\nSheriff,\" he says. \"I tell you he is here in this house. There! For here\r\nis his cap. I found it. I found him, and I want him and I want that\r\nthousand dollars. Search!\"\r\n\r\n\"And I tell you he is not here!\" cries the girl, \"and you shall not\r\nsearch, 'less--\"\r\n\r\nAnd the horn is lifted menacingly over the fire. \"Won't you take my\r\nword?\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall take _my_ word!\" shouts Dosson.\r\n\r\n\"I will take your single word, Miss, against a thousand such men.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the sheriff puts on his cap, turns, and is about to go.\r\n\r\n\"But he is here! The thousand dollars, Mr. Sheriff!\" cries Dosson.\r\n\r\n\"Miss, officers sometimes have duties that are more unpleasant to them\r\nthan to the parties most concerned. You say he is not here?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is not here, Mr. Sheriff--he is not here!\" cries Carrie.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff twists his cap on his head. \"And you will be sworn, as the\r\nothers were?\" says the sheriff. \"So much the better; and that will be\r\nquite satisfactory. Ah, here is the Bible at hand.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he takes from the little shelf the tattered book. The girl stands\r\nstill as stone, with the engine of death in her hand. The officer bows,\r\nsmiles, reaches the book with his left hand, lays his cap on the table,\r\nand lifts his right hand in the air. Her little fingers reach out\r\nfirmly, fearlessly, and rest on the book. Her eyes are looking straight\r\ninto his.\r\n\r\n\"It may be my duty, Miss, to search the house, after what that 'un has\r\nsaid, and, Miss, I expect it is my duty. But, Miss, I is not the man to\r\nexpose you before a man as might like to see you exposed. And then that\r\npoor devil that come back here, Miss, on bleeding feet--crawling back\r\nhere on his hands and knees, to die by his mother's grave.\"\r\n\r\nThe voice is tremulous; the hand that is raised in the air comes down.\r\nThen lifting it again he says resolutely, \"Swear, Miss!\"\r\n\r\nAll are looking--leaning--with the profoundest interest. There is a dark\r\nstrange face peering through a rift in the half-opened curtain. \"God\r\nbless her! God bless her! She can, and she will!\" mutters Forty-nine.\r\n\r\n\"She can't!\" cries Dosson. \"She believes the book and, by gol, she\r\ncan't!\" The man says this over his shoulder, and in a husky whisper as\r\nthe girl seems to pause.\r\n\r\n\"Hold your hand on the book, and swear as I shall tell you,\" says the\r\nsheriff.\r\n\r\nShe only holds more firmly to the book; her eyes are fixed more steadily\r\non his.\r\n\r\n\"Say it as I say it. I do solemnly swear--\"\r\n\r\n\"I do solemnly swear--\"\r\n\r\n\"That John Logan--\"\r\n\r\n\"That John Logan--\"\r\n\r\n\"Is not here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is--\"\r\n\r\n\"Is _here_!\" The curtain is thrown back, and the fugitive dashes into\r\ntheir midst. The book falls from the sheriff's hand, and there is a\r\nmurmur of amazement.\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, my girl!\" And there is the stillness of a Sabbath\r\nmorning over all. \"God bless you; and God will reward you for this, for\r\nI cannot. You have made me another being, Carrie. I have lost my life,\r\nbut you have saved my soul!\" and turning cheerfully to the sheriff he\r\nreaches his hands. \"Now, sir, I am ready.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE ESCAPE.\r\n\r\n    _O tranquil moon! O pitying moon!\r\n      Put forth thy cool, protecting palms,\r\n      And cool their eyes with cooling alms,\r\n    Against the burning tears of noon._\r\n\r\n    _O saintly, noiseless-footed nun!\r\n      O sad-browed patient mother, keep\r\n      Thy homeless children while they sleep,\r\n    And kiss them, weeping, every one._\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first there was a loud demonstration against Logan by the mob, that\r\nalways gathers about where a man is captured by his fellows--the wolves\r\nthat come up when the wounded buffalo falls. There was talk of a\r\nvigilance committee and of lynching.\r\n\r\nBut when the stout, resolute sheriff led the man in chains down the\r\ntrail through the deep snow, and turned him over to the officer in\r\ncharge of a little squad of soldiers at the other side of the valley, no\r\nman interfered further. Indeed, Dosson and Emens were too anxious about\r\nthe promised reward to make any demonstration against this man's life\r\nnow. He was worth to them a thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nA lawyer reading this, will smile here at the loose way in which the law\r\nwas administered there in the outer edge of the world at that time. Here\r\nis a sheriff, with a warrant in his pocket, made returnable to a\r\nmagistrate. The sheriff arrests the man on this warrant and takes him\r\ndirectly to the military authorities, which have been so long seeking\r\nhim, utterly unconscious that he is doing aught but the proper thing.\r\nAnd yet, after all, it was the shortest and best course to take.\r\n\r\nI shall not forget the face of the prisoner as we stood beside the trail\r\nin the snow, while he was led past down the mouth of the canyon toward\r\nthe other side of the valley. It was grand!\r\n\r\nSome strangers, standing in the street, spoke of the majesty of the\r\nman's bearing. They openly dared to admire his lifted face, and to speak\r\nwith derision of his captors as the party passed on. This made the low\r\nelement, out of which mobs are always created, a little bit timid.\r\nPossibly it was this that saved the prisoner. But most likely it was the\r\nresolute face of the honest sheriff. For, say what you will, there is\r\nnothing so cowardly as a mob. Throw what romance you please over the\r\nactions of the Vigilantes of California, they were murderers--coarse,\r\ncowardly and brutal; murderers, legally and morally, every one of them.\r\nIt is to be admitted that they did good work at first. But their\r\nexample, followed even down to this day, has been fruitful of the\r\ndarkest crimes.\r\n\r\nWhen Forty-nine awoke next morning from his long drunken slumber, the\r\nchildren were not there. Dosson called, arrayed in his best; but Carrie\r\nwas not to be seen. Forty-nine could give no account of her. This day of\r\ntriumph for Dosson did not yield him so much as he had all the night\r\nbefore fancied. He was furious.\r\n\r\nForty-nine, as usual, after a spree, meekly took up his pick, after a\r\nbreakfast on a piece of bread and the drawings of coffee grounds that\r\nhad been thrice boiled over, and stumbled away towards his tunnel, and\r\nwas soon lost in the deeps of the earth.\r\n\r\nYou may be certain that this desperate character, just taken after so\r\nmuch trouble and cost, was securely ironed at the little military camp\r\nacross the valley. An old log cabin was made a temporary prison, and\r\nsoldiers strode up and down on the four sides of it day and night.\r\n\r\nAnd yet there was hardly need of such heavy irons. True, the soldiers\r\noutside, as they walked up and down at night and shifted their muskets\r\nfrom side to side, and slapped their shoulders with their arms and hands\r\nto keep from freezing, heard the chains grate and toss and rattle, often\r\nand often, as if some one was trying to tear and loosen them. But it was\r\nonly the man tossing his arms in delirium as he lay on the fir boughs in\r\nthe corner.\r\n\r\nDosson, after much inquiry, and many day's watching about Forty-nine's\r\ncabin, called and was admitted to see the prisoner, who by this time,\r\nthough weak and worn to a skeleton, was convalescing. The coarse and\r\ninsolent intruder started back with dismay. There sat the girl he so\r\nhoped and longed to possess, talking to him tenderly, soothing him,\r\ngiving her life for his.\r\n\r\nLong and brutal would be the story of the agent's endeavors to tear this\r\ngirl away from the bedside of the sufferer--if such a place could be\r\ncalled a bedside. The girl would not leave John Logan, and the timid boy\r\nwho sat shivering back in the corner of the cabin, would not leave the\r\ngirl. The three were bound together by a chain stronger than that which\r\nbound the wrists of the prisoner; aye, ten thousand times stronger, for\r\nman had fashioned the one--God the other.\r\n\r\nSudden and swift arrives summer in California. The trail was opened to\r\nthe Reservation down the mountain, and the officer collected his few\r\nIndians together in a long, single line, all chained to a long heavy\r\ncable, and prepared to march. About the middle of the chain stood John\r\nLogan, now strong enough to walk. At the front were placed a few\r\nmiserable, spiritless Indians, who had been found loafing about the\r\nminers's cabins--the drunkards, thieves, vagabonds of their tribe, such\r\nas all tribes have, such as we have, citizen-reader--while the rear was\r\nbrought up by a boy and girl, Carrie and Johnny, a pitiful sight!\r\n\r\nDo not be surprised. When you have learned to know the absolute, the\r\nutterly unlimited power and authority of an Indian Agent or sub-Agent,\r\nyou have only to ask the capability for villainy he may possess in order\r\nto find the limit of his actions.\r\n\r\nCould you have seen the lofty disdain of this girl for her suitor at\r\nthat first and every subsequent meeting, as she kept at the bedside of\r\nJohn Logan, you could have guessed what might follow. The man's love was\r\nturned to rage. He resolved to send her back to the Reservation also. It\r\nis true, the soldiers had learned to respect and to pity her. It is\r\ntrue, the little Lieutenant said, with a soldierly oath, as she was\r\nbeing chained, that she was whiter than the man who was having it done.\r\nYet the soldiers, and their officer as well, had their orders; and a\r\nsoldier's duties, as you know, are all bound up in one word.\r\n\r\nAs for the wretched boy, he might have escaped. He was a negative sort\r\nof a being at best; and no one, save Logan and the girl, either hated\r\nhim or loved him greatly, tender and true as he was. They both implored\r\nhim to slip between the fingers of the soldiers and not go to the\r\nReservation. But he would not think of being separated from his sister.\r\nPoor, stunted, starved little thing! There were wrinkles about his face;\r\nhis hands were black, short, and hard, from digging roots from the\r\nfrosty ground. It is not probable the lad had ever had enough to eat\r\nsince he could remember. And so he was a dwarf, a dwarf in body and in\r\nsoul; and instead of showing some spirit and standing up now and helping\r\nthe girl, as he should, he leaned on her utterly, and left her to be the\r\nman of the two. The little spark of fire that had twice or thrice\r\nflashed up in the last few years, seemed now to die out entirely, and he\r\nstood there chained, looking back now and then over his shoulder at the\r\nsoldiers, looking forward trying to catch a glance from his sister now\r\nand then, but never once making any murmur or complaint.\r\n\r\nIt was a hot, sultry day, such as suddenly enters and takes possession\r\nof canyons in the Sierras, when the little party of prisoners were\r\nmarched through the little camp at the end of the canyon on their way to\r\nthe Reservation.\r\n\r\nAnd the camp all came out to see, but the camp was silent. It was not a\r\npleasant sight. A soldier with a bayonet on his loaded musket walking by\r\nthe side of a woman with her hands in chains, is not an inspiring\r\nspectacle. With all respect for your superior judgments, Mr. President,\r\nCommander-in-Chief, and Captains of the army, I say there is a nobler\r\nuse for the army than this.\r\n\r\nLet us hasten on from this subject and this scene. But do not imagine\r\nthat the miner, the settler, or even the most hardened about the camp,\r\nfelt ennobled at this sight. I tell you there was a murmur of\r\nindignation and disgust heard all up and down the canyon. The newer and\r\nbetter element of the camp was furious. One man even went so far as to\r\nwrite a letter to a country paper on the subject.\r\n\r\nBut when the editor responded in a heavy leader, and assured the camp of\r\nits deadly peril from these prowling savages, and proclaimed that the\r\nIndians were being taken where they would have good medicine, care, food\r\nand clothing, and be educated and taught the arts of agriculture, the\r\ncase really did not look so bad; and in less than a week the whole\r\naffair had been forgotten by all the camp. Aye, all, save old\r\nForty-nine.\r\n\r\nBy the express order of sub-Agent Dosson, the old man, who had been\r\ndeclared a dangerous character by him, was not permitted to see the girl\r\nfrom the first day he discovered that she still clung to Logan. But the\r\nold man had worked on and waited. He had kept constantly sober. He would\r\nsee and would save this girl at all hazards.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as the sorrowful remnant of a once great tribe was being taken,\r\nlike Israel into captivity, he rushed forward to meet her, to hold her\r\nhands, to press her to his heart, and bid her be strong and hopeful.\r\n\r\nThe agent saw the old man and shouted to the officer; the officer called\r\nto the soldiers--the line moved forward, the bayonets crossed the old\r\nman's breast as the prisoners passed on down the mountain, and he saw\r\nthe sad, pitiful face no more.\r\n\r\nKeep the picture before you: Chained together in long lines, marched\r\nalways on foot in single file, under the stars and stripes, officers in\r\nuniforms, clanking swords--the uniform of the Union, riding bravely\r\nalong the lines! The two men who had done so much to get this desperate\r\nIndian out of the way, remained behind to keep possession of his house\r\nand land. They had not even the decency to build a new cabin. They only\r\nbroke down the door, put up a new one with stouter hinges and latch; and\r\nthe long-coveted land was theirs.\r\n\r\nAs for old Forty-nine, all the light had left the mountain and the\r\nvalley now. Carrie, whom he had cared for from the first almost, little\r\nStumps, whom he had found with her, hardly big enough to toddle\r\nabout--both were gone. All three gone. John Logan, whom he had taught to\r\nread and taught a thousand things at his own cabin-fire in the long\r\nsnowy winters--all these gone together. It was as if the sun had gone\r\ndown for Forty-nine forever. There was no sun or moon or stars, or any\r\nthing that shines in the mountains any more for him. His had been a\r\ndesolate life all the long years he had delved away into the mountain at\r\nhis tunnel. No man had taken his hand in friendship for many and many a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe man now nailed up his cabin door--an idle task, perhaps, for men\r\ninstinctively avoided it, and the trail of late took a cut across the\r\nspur of the hill rather than pass by his door. But somehow the old man\r\nfelt that he might not be back soon. And as men had kept away from that\r\ncabin while he was there, he did not feel that they should enter it in\r\nhis absence.\r\n\r\nOne evening in the hot, sultry summer, old Forty-nine rode down from the\r\nmountain into the great valley, following the trail taken by the lines\r\nof chained captives, and set his face for the Reservation.\r\n\r\nAt a risk of repetition, let us look at this Reservation. The government\r\nhad ordered a United States officer, of the rank of lieutenant, to set\r\napart a Reservation for the Indians on land not acquired and not likely\r\nto be desired by the white settlers, and to gather the Indians together\r\nthere and keep them there by force, if force should be required. This\r\nyoung man established a Reservation on the border of a tule lake, shut\r\nin by a crescent of low sage-brush hills. The Indian camp was laid out\r\non the very edge of this alkali lake. The crescent of sage-brush hills\r\nof a mile in circuit, reaching back and almost around the Reservation,\r\nwas mounted at three points by cannon, ready to sweep the camp below. On\r\nthis circuit of hills, healthy and pleasant enough the officers and\r\nsoldiers had their quarters. Down in the damp, deadly valley, on the\r\nedge of the alkali lake, the newly appointed Indian Agent, with a\r\ntremendous appropriation to be expended in building houses and\r\nestablishing the Indians in their new homes, built the village. It was\r\nmade up of two rows of low, one-story, one-room huts. Two big lamps hung\r\nin the one street; and from lamp to lamp before the doors of the little\r\nhuts with earthen floors and turf-covered roofs, paced soldiers night\r\nand day.\r\n\r\nThese houses were damp and dismal from the first. Soon they began to be\r\nmouldy; fungi and toadstools and the like began to grow up in the\r\ncorners and out of the logs. Little shiny reptiles, in the long hot\r\nrainy days that followed, and worms and all sorts of hideous vermin,\r\nbegan to creep and crawl through these dreadful dens of death, over the\r\nsick and dying Indians. Long slimy, unnamed, and unknown worms crawled\r\nup out of the earth, as if they could not wait for the victims to die.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were dying off by hundreds. They went to the officers and\r\ncomplained. The officers ordered a double guard to be set. And that was\r\nall.\r\n\r\nYou marvel that these young lieutenants could be so imperious and cruel?\r\nIt does seem past belief. But pardon just one paragraph of digression\r\nwhile we recall the conduct of a younger class only last year on the\r\nHudson. To me the real question before the courts in the Whitaker case\r\nis not whether this quiet stranger, with a tinge of black man's blood in\r\nhis veins, mutilated himself, or no. But the real question is, did they\r\nor did they not, by their determined and persistent persecutions and\r\ninsults, drive him in a fit of desperation to do this in the hope of\r\npulling down ruin on the heads of all? This seems probable to me, and to\r\nme is far more monstrous than if they had, in sudden anger, cut his\r\nears, or even cut his throat; and if these young bloods could so treat a\r\nstranger there, standing at such a manifest disadvantage, what would\r\nthey not be capable of when they are, for the first time, clothed with\r\na little brief authority, away out on the savage edge of the world?\r\n\r\nThe water here, as the hot season came on, was something dreadful. It\r\nwas slimy with alkali. Little black worms knotted and twisted themselves\r\ntogether at the bottom of the cup, like bunches of witch-woven\r\nhorse-hair. The Indians were dying of malaria. They were burning up with\r\nthe fever. And this was the only water these people, who had been used\r\nto the fresh sweet snow-water of the Sierras, could have.\r\n\r\nWhat could they do? They appealed to the officers. They were answered\r\nwith insult: \"You must get used to it. You must get civilized.\"\r\n\r\nThese dying Indians began to fight and quarrel among themselves. Ah,\r\nthey were very wicked. They were quarrelsome as dogs; almost as\r\nquarrelsome as Christians!\r\n\r\nThis was a small Paris in siege. It was Jerusalem surrounded by Titus.\r\nDown there, dying as they were, a savage Simon and a degenerate John, as\r\nin Jerusalem of old, led their followers against each other, even\r\nacross their dead that lay unburied in the mouldy death-pens and about\r\ntheir dark and narrow doors, and slew each other as did God's chosen\r\npeople when besieged by the son of Vespasian.\r\n\r\nThen the men in brass and blue turned the cannon loose on the howling\r\nsavages, and shot them into silence and submission.\r\n\r\nJohn Logan, Carrie and little Stumps, about this time had been brought\r\nwith others from the mountains to the Reservation. Logan insisted on\r\nkeeping the two children at his side and under his protection. He was\r\nlaughed at by agents, and sub-agents.\r\n\r\nHe was kept chained. He was assigned to a strong hut with gratings\r\nacross the window--or rather the little loop-hole which let in the\r\nlight. The guards were kept constantly at his door. He was entered on\r\nthe books as a very desperate character, a barn-burner, and possible\r\nmurderer. And so night and day he was kept under the constant watch of\r\nthe soldiers with fixed bayonets. True, he was soon too weak to lift his\r\nmanacled hands in strife. But nevertheless he was kept chained and\r\ndoubly guarded in the little hut with gratings at the loop-hole.\r\n\r\nWould he attempt to escape?\r\n\r\nThere were many broken fragments of many broken tribes here. Tribes that\r\nhad fought each other to the death--fought as Germans and French have\r\nfought. And why not, pray? Has not a heathen as good a right to fight a\r\nheathen as has a Christian to fight a Christian? The only difference is,\r\nwe preach and profess peace; they, war.\r\n\r\nLogan was alone in this damp hut and deadly pen. He could hear the tramp\r\nof the soldiers; he could see the long thin silver beams of the moon\r\nreach through the gratings, reach on and on, around and over and across\r\nthe damp, mouldy floor, as if reaching out, like God's white fingers, to\r\ntouch his face, to cool his fever, and comfort him. But he could see,\r\nhear nothing more. He was so utterly alone! They would send an\r\nunfriendly Indian in with his breakfast, foul and unfit for even a well\r\nman, and a tin cup of water in the morning. Soon after the doctor would\r\ncall around, also. Then he would see no face again till evening, when\r\nmore food and water would be brought. At last the food was brought only\r\nin the morning. This did not at all affect Logan; for from the first\r\nthe old pan containing his food had been taken away untouched. The man\r\nwas certainly dying. The guard and garrison on the hill were waiting for\r\nthis desperate character, whose capture had cost so much time and money,\r\nto attempt to escape.\r\n\r\nFrom the first, even in the face of the blunt refusal, John Logan had\r\nbegged for the boy to be brought him. He was certain the little fellow\r\nwas dying--dying of desolation and a broken heart.\r\n\r\nAbout the sixth day, the man chanced to hear from an Indian that the boy\r\nhad quite broken down, and, refusing all food, lay moaning in his corner\r\nall the time, and all the time crying for John Logan or Carrie. The man\r\nnow entreated more persistently than ever before. He promised the Doctor\r\nto eat, to get well, if only the boy could be brought to him and be\r\npermitted to spend his time there. For he knew from what the Doctor said\r\nthat he must soon die if things kept on as they were. The weather was\r\ngrowing hotter and hotter; the water and the food, if possible, more\r\nrepulsive than ever. Logan could no longer walk across the pen in which\r\nhe was confined. He was so weak that he could not raise his heavily\r\nmanacled hands to his face.\r\n\r\nAfter the usual diplomacy and delay, the Doctor reported his condition,\r\nand also his earnest desire for the boy, to the Indian Agent.\r\n\r\nThere was a consultation. Would this crafty and desperate Indian attempt\r\nto escape? Was not all this a ruse on his part? Would not the United\r\nStates imperil its peace and security if this boy and this man were to\r\nbe allowed together? This mighty question oppressed the mind of the\r\nagent in charge for a whole day. Then, after the Doctor again urged the\r\nprisoner's request--for man and boy both seemed to be dying--this man\r\nreluctantly consented. Would Logan now escape after all? Could he ever\r\nget through these iron bars and past the four soldiers pacing up and\r\ndown outside? Would he escape from the Reservation at last?\r\n\r\nAnd now, at the close of the hottest and most dreadful day they had\r\nendured, an old Indian woman, bent almost double, came shuffling in by\r\npermission of the guard, and laid something on a pile of rushes and\r\nwillows in a corner of the pen across from where John Logan lay.\r\n\r\nThe man heard a noise as of some one breathing heavily, and attempted to\r\nrise. He could hardly move his head. But in trying to support himself to\r\na sitting posture, he moved his hands, and so rattled his manacles. This\r\nfrightened the superstitious old woman, and she ran away. She had laid a\r\nlittle skeleton on the rushes in the corner.\r\n\r\nLogan with great effort managed to sit up and look across into the\r\ncorner that was now being slowly illuminated by a beam of bright, white\r\nmoonlight, that stole down the wall toward the little heap lying there,\r\nlike some holy, white-hooded and noiseless-footed nun. At last he saw\r\nthe face. It was that of little Stumps. The man sank back where he lay.\r\nThe sight was so pitiful, so dreadful to see, that he forgot his own\r\nmisery and was all in tears for the little fellow who lay dying before\r\nhim. He forgot his own fearful condition at the sight, and again\r\nattempted to rise and reach the little heap that lay moaning in the\r\ncorner. It was impossible; he could not rise.\r\n\r\nAnd how fared Carrie all this time? Little better than the others. She\r\nwas no longer beautiful. And so she was left, along with a score or\r\nmore of other dying and desperate creatures, in another part of the\r\nReservation. She was not permitted to see the boy. Least of all was she\r\npermitted to see, or even hear from, John Logan. Day by day she drooped\r\nand sank slowly but surely down toward the grave.\r\n\r\nBut she did not fear death. She had faced it in all forms before. And\r\neven now death walked the place night and day, and she was not afraid.\r\nShe lay down at night with death. She knew no fear at all. She\r\nconstantly asked for and wanted to see the helpless little boy, in the\r\nhope that she might help or cheer him. But no one listened to anything\r\nshe had to say. Once, after a very hot and horrible day, two of her\r\ncompanions in captivity were found to be dead. The guard who paced up\r\nand down between the huts was told of it. But he said it was too late to\r\nhave them carted away that night. And so this girl lay there all night\r\nby the side of the dead, and was not afraid. Nay, she even wished that\r\nshe too, when the cart came in the morning, might be found silent and at\r\npeace. And then she thought of those whom she loved, and reproached\r\nherself for being so selfish as to want to die when she still might be\r\nof use to them.\r\n\r\nLet us escape from these dreadful scenes as soon as possible. They are\r\nlike a nightmare to me.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the mind turns back constantly to John Logan lying there; the\r\nlittle heap of bones in the corner; the pure white moonlight creeping\r\nsoftly down the wall, as if to look into the little fellow's eyes, yet\r\nas if half afraid of wakening him.\r\n\r\nCould Logan escape? Chains, double guards, death--all these at his door\r\nholding him back, waiting to take him if he ever passed out at that\r\ndoor. Mould on the floor, mould on the walls, mould on the very\r\nblankets. The man was burning to death with the fever; the boy, too,\r\nlying over there. The boy moaned now and then. Once Logan heard him cry\r\nfor water. That warm, slimy, wormy water! O, for one, just one draught\r\nof cool, sweet water from the mountains--their dearly loved native\r\nmountains--and die!\r\n\r\nThe moon rose higher still, round and white and large; and at last,\r\nwheeling over the camp of death, seemed to pause in pity and look full\r\nin upon those two dying captives. It seemed to soothe them both.\r\n\r\nThe little boy saw the moonbeam on the wall, and was pacified. It looked\r\nlike the face of an old friend. It brought back the old time; the life,\r\nthe woods, the water--above all, the cool sweet waters of the mountains.\r\nHe seemed to know where he was. He lay still a long time, and then felt\r\nstronger. He called to John Logan. No answer. Then the feeble, piping\r\nlittle voice lifted up and called as loud as it could. No answer still.\r\nThe boy crawled from off the little pallet and tried to rise. He sank\r\ndown on the damp floor, and then tried to crawl to John Logan. He tried\r\nto call again, as he began to slowly crawl towards the other corner. But\r\nthe poor little voice was no louder than a whisper. Very weak and very\r\nwild, and almost quite delirious, the boy kept on as best he could. He\r\nat last touched the blankets, the breast, and he drew himself up just as\r\nthe moon looked down on the pale upturned face. Then, with a moan, a\r\nwild, pitiful cry, the little fellow fell back on the damp mouldy floor.\r\n\r\nJohn Logan was dead! Despite the chains, the bars at the window, the\r\ndouble guard at the door, the man had escaped at last!\r\n\r\nThe pitying moon did not hasten to go. It lingered there, reached down\r\nalong the damp, mouldy floor to a little form of skin and bone; and\r\nthen, as if this moon-beam were the Savior's mantle spreading out to\r\ncover the white and stainless soul, it covered the pinched and pitiful\r\nlittle face. For the boy, too, lay dead.\r\n\r\nHere was the end of two lives that had known only the long dark shadows,\r\nonly the deep solitude and solemnity of the forest. Like tall weeds that\r\nsometimes shoot up in dark and unfrequented places, and that put forth\r\nstrange, sweet flowers, these two lives had sprung up there, put forth\r\nafter their fashion the best that is in man, and then perished in\r\ndarkness, unnamed, unknown.\r\n\r\nWho were they? John Logan, it is now whispered, was the son of an\r\nofficer made famous in the war annals of the world. The officer had been\r\nstationed here in early manhood, gave his heart as she believed to a\r\ndaughter of a brave and powerful chief, whose lands lay near where he\r\nwas stationed for a summer, and then? The old, old tale of betrayal and\r\ndesertion. The woman was disgraced before her people. And so when they\r\nretreated before the encroachments of the whites, she, being despised\r\nand cast off by her people, remained behind waiting the promised return\r\nof her lover. He? He did not even acknowledge his child. This General,\r\nwho had taken the lives of a thousand men, had not the moral courage to\r\nreach out a hand to this one little waif which he had called into\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nDo you know, there never was a dog drowned in the pound so base and low\r\nthat he would not fight? Yet this brute-valor is largely admired, even\r\nto this day, by Christian people. This man could kill men, could risk\r\nhis own life, but he could not give this innocent child his name.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was, the boy, after he had learned to read, by the help of\r\nForty-nine, and an occasional missionary who sometimes preached to the\r\nminers, and spent the pleasant summer months in the mountains--this boy,\r\nI say, who at last had heard all the story of his father's weakness and\r\nwickedness from Forty-nine's lips disdained to use his name, but chose\r\none famous in the annals of the Indians. And this brief sketch is about\r\nall there is to tell of the young man who lay dead in chains, in the\r\nprison-pen of the Reservation.\r\n\r\n\"Civilization kills the Indian,\" said the Doctor that morning in his\r\ndaily round, after he had examined the dead bodies.\r\n\r\n\"He does not look so desperate, after all,\" said an officer, as he held\r\nhis nose with his thumb and finger, and leaned forward to look at the\r\ndead Indian, while his other hand held his sword gracefully at his side.\r\nAnd then this officer, after making certain that this desperate\r\ncharacter was quite dead, drew forth his cigar-case, struck a light, and\r\nclimbing upon his horse, galloped back to his quarters on the hill.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, now left alone, stooped and put back the long silken hair\r\nfrom the thin baby-face of the boy, as the body was brought out and\r\nbeing carried to the cart made to receive the dead, and remarked that it\r\nwas not at all like that of the other Indians. Another young officer\r\ncame by as the Doctor did this, and his attention was called to the\r\nfact. The officer tapped his sword-hilt a little, looked curiously at\r\nthe pitiful, pinched little face, and then ordering the soldiers to move\r\non with their burden, he turned to the Doctor and remarked, as the two\r\nwent back together to their quarters on the hill, that \"no doubt it was\r\nthe effect of the few days of civilization on the Reservation that had\r\nmade the boy so white; pity he had died so soon; a year on the\r\nReservation, and he would have been quite white.\"\r\n\r\nUnlike other parts of the Union, here the races are much mixed. Creoles,\r\nKanakas, Mexicans, Malays, whites, and blacks, have intermixed with the\r\nnatives, till the color line is not clearly drawn. And in one case at\r\nleast some orphan children of white parentage were sent to the\r\nReservation by parties who wanted their property. Though I do not know\r\nthat the fact of white children being found on a Reservation makes the\r\nsufferings of the savages less or their wrongs more outrageous. I only\r\nmention it as a frozen fact.\r\n\r\nCarrie did not know of the desolation which death had made in her life,\r\ntill old Forty-nine, who arrived too late to attend the burial of his\r\ndead, told her. She did not weep. She did not even answer. She only\r\nturned her face to the wall as she lay in her wretched bed, burning up\r\nwith the fever, but made no sign. There was nothing more for her to\r\nbear. She had felt all that human nature can feel. She was dull, dazed,\r\nindifferent, now to all that might occur.\r\n\r\nTo turn back for the space of a paragraph, I am bound to admit that\r\nthese dying Indians often behaved very foolishly, and, in their\r\nsuperstitions brought much of the fatality upon themselves. For example,\r\nthey had a horror of the white man's remedies, and refused to take the\r\nmedicines administered to them. Brought down from the cool, fresh\r\nmountains, where they lived under the trees in the purest air and in the\r\nmost beautiful places, they at once fell ready victims to malarial\r\nfevers. The white man, by a liberal use of quinine and whisky, as well\r\nas by careful diet, lived very well at the Reservation, and suffered but\r\nlittle, yet had he been forced to live in a pen, crowded together like\r\npigs in a sty, with the bad air, on the damp, mouldy ground, he had died\r\ntoo, as fast perhaps as the Indian died.\r\n\r\nThe old man could do but little for the dying girl. He was in bad odor\r\nwith the officers; they treated him with as little consideration almost\r\nas if he too had been a savage. But he was constant at her side; he\r\nbrought a lemon which he had begged, on his knees, as it were, and tried\r\nto make her a cool drink of the slimy, wormy water. But the girl could\r\nnot drink it. She turned her face once more to the wall, and this time,\r\nit seemed, to die.\r\n\r\nOne morning, before the sun rose, she recovered her wandering mind and\r\ncalled old Forty-nine to her side. She was surely dying; but her mind\r\nwas clear, and she understood perfectly all she said or did. Her dark\r\neyes were sunken deep in their places, and her long, sun-browned hands\r\nwere only skin and bone. They fell down across her heaving little\r\nbreast, as if they were the hands of a skeleton. Little wonder that her\r\npersecutors had turned away with horror, perhaps with fear, from those\r\ndeep, hollow eyes, and the pitiful emaciated frame, that could no longer\r\nlift itself where it lay.\r\n\r\nThe old man fell down on his knees beside her and reached his face\r\nacross to hers. With great effort she lifted her two naked long, arms,\r\nand wound them about the old man's neck. He seemed to know that death\r\nwas near, as he reached his face over hers. Over his cheeks and down his\r\nlong white beard the tears ran like rain and fell on her face and\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n\"Forty-nine, father! Let me call you father; may I? I never had any\r\nfather but you,\" said the girl feebly, as the tears fell fast on her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, call me father. Call me father, Carrie, my Carrie; my poor,\r\ndear, dear little Carrie,--do call me father, for of all the world I\r\nhave only you to love and live for,\" sobbed the old man as if his heart\r\nwould break.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, father, when I die take me back, take me back to the\r\nmountains. I want to hear the water--the cool, sweet, clear water, where\r\nI lie; and the wind in the trees--the cool, pure wind in the trees,\r\nfather. And you know the three trees just above the old cabin on the\r\nhill by the water-fall? Bury me, bury me there. Yes, there, where I can\r\nhear the cool water all the time, and the wind in the trees. And--and\r\nwon't you please cut my name on the tree by the water? My name,\r\nCarrie--just Carrie, that's all. I have no other name--just Carrie. Will\r\nyou? Will you do this for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"As there is a God--as I live, I will!\" and the old man lifted his face\r\nas he bared his head, and looked toward heaven.\r\n\r\nThe girl's mind wandered now. She spoke incoherently for a few moments,\r\nand then was silent. Her form was convulsed, her breast heaved just a\r\nlittle, her helpless hands reached about the old man's neck as if they\r\nwould hold him from passing from her presence; they fell away, and then\r\nall was still. It was now gray dawn.\r\n\r\nThis man's heart was bursting with rage and a savage sorrow. He was now\r\nstung with a sense of awful injustice. His heart was swelling with\r\nindignation. He took up the form before him; up in his arms, as if it\r\nhad been that of an infant. He threw his handkerchief across the face as\r\nhe passed out, stooping low through the dark and narrow doorway, and\r\nstrode in great, long and hurried steps down the street and over toward\r\nthe hills beyond, where his horse was tethered in the long, brown\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\nAs the old man passed the post on the hill, where the officers slept\r\nunder the protection of loaded cannon, the guard stopped him with his\r\nbayonet.\r\n\r\n\"Halt! Where are you going? And what have you there? Come, where are you\r\ngoing?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man threw back the handkerchief as the guard approached, and the\r\nnew sunlight fell on the girl's face.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to bury my dead.\"\r\n\r\nThe guard started back. He almost dropped his gun as he saw that face;\r\nthen, recovering himself, he bared his head, bowed his face reverently,\r\nand motioned the old man on.\r\n\r\nForty-nine reached his horse in the brown grass, laid his burden down,\r\nthrew on the saddle, drew the girth with sudden strength and energy, as\r\nif for a long and desperate ride. Then resuming his load, tenderly, as\r\nif it were a sleeping infant, he vaulted into the saddle and dashed away\r\nfor the Sierras, that lay before him, and lifted like a city of snowy\r\ntemples, reared to the worship of the Eternal.\r\n\r\nIt was a desperate ride for life. The girl's long soft black hair was\r\nin the wind. The air was purer, sweeter here; there was a sense of\r\nliberty, of life, in this ride, right in the face of the rising sun as\r\nit streamed down over the snowy summits of the Sierras. Every plunge of\r\nthe strong swift mustang, brought them nearer to home, to hope, to life.\r\nThe horse seemed to know that now was his day of mighty enterprise.\r\nPerhaps he was glad to get away and up and out of that awful valley of\r\ndeath; for he forged ahead as horse never plunged before, with his\r\nstrange double burthen, that had frightened many a better trained\r\nmustang than he.\r\n\r\nAt last they began to climb the chapparal hills. Then they touched the\r\nhills of pine, and the breath of balsam had a sense of health and\r\nhealing in it that only the invalid who is dying for his mountain home\r\ncan appreciate.\r\n\r\nThe horse was in a foam; the day was hot; the old man was fainting in\r\nthe saddle.\r\n\r\nWater! Water at last! Down a steep, mossy crag, hung with brier and\r\nblossom, came tumbling, with loud laughter like merry girls at play, a\r\nlittle mountain stream. Cool as the snow, sweet as the blossom, it fell\r\nfoaming in its pebbly bed at the base of the crag, under the deep, cool\r\nshadows of the pines.\r\n\r\nThe old man threw himself from his horse, and beast and man drank\r\ntogether as he held the girl in his arms, where the spray dashed down\r\nlike a holy baptismal from the very hand of God upon her hair and face.\r\nThe hands clutched, the breast heaved a little, the lips moved as if to\r\ndrink in the cool sweet water. Her eyes feebly opened. And then the old\r\nman bore her back under the pines, and laid her on the soft bed of dry\r\nsweet-smelling pine-quills.\r\n\r\nThen clasping his hands above her, as he bent his face to hers, he\r\nuttered his first prayer--the first for many and many a weary year. It\r\nwas a prayer of thanksgiving, of gratitude. The girl would live; and he\r\nwould now have something to live for--to love.\r\n\r\nIt had been a strange weird sight, that old man, his long hair in the\r\nwind, his strong horse plunging madly ahead, all white with foam,\r\nclimbing the Sierras as the sun climbed up. The girl lay in his arms\r\nbefore him, her long dark hair all down over the horse's neck, tangled\r\nin the horse's mane, catching in the brush and the wild vines and leaves\r\nthat hung over the trail as they flew past.\r\n\r\nAnd oftentime back over his shoulder the old man threw his long white\r\nbeard and looked back. He felt, he knew, that he was pursued. He fancied\r\nhe could all the time hear the sound of horses' feet.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if his eyes had been gifted with the vision of the prophets of\r\nold, he would indeed have seen the pursuer. That pursuer was also an old\r\nman, and not much unlike himself; an old man with a scythe--death. Death\r\nfollowing fast from the hot valley of pestilence, where he, death, kept,\r\nif possible, closer watch than the Agents, that no Indian ever returned\r\nto his native mountains. But death gave up the pursuit, and turned back\r\nfrom the moment the baptismal fountain touched the girl's fevered\r\nforehead. At last the old man who held her in his arms, rose up, rode on\r\nand down to his cabin in the twilight, all secure from pursuit of\r\nAgents, death, or any one. The girl, quite conscious, opened her eyes\r\nand looked around on the tall, nodding pine trees, that stood in long,\r\ndusky lines, as if drawn up to welcome her return to the heart of the\r\nSierras.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER'S NOTE:\r\n\r\nEvery effort has been made to replicate this text as faithfully as\r\npossible, including obsolete and variant spellings and other\r\ninconsistencies.
