Neither history\r\nnor geography allows this theory. The life of the two countries was\r\nwidely separated. Great Britain lay turned to the east; her harbours\r\nopened to the sunrising, and her first traffic was across the narrow\r\nwaters of the Channel and the German Sea. But Ireland had another\r\naspect; her natural harbours swelled with the waves of the Atlantic,\r\nher outlook was over the ocean, and long before history begins her\r\nsailors braved the perils of the Gaulish sea. The peoples of Britain,\r\nCelts and English, came to her from the opposite lowland coasts; the\r\npeople of Ireland crossed a wider ocean-track, from northern France to\r\nthe shores of the Bay of Biscay. The two islands had a different\r\nhistory; their trade-routes were not the same; they lived apart, and\r\ndeveloped apart their civilisations.\r\n\r\nWe do not know when the Gaels first entered Ireland, coming according\r\nto ancient Irish legends across the Gaulish sea. One invasion followed\r\nanother, and an old Irish tract gives the definite Gaelic monarchy as\r\nbeginning in the fourth century B.C. They drove the earlier peoples,\r\nthe Iberians, from the stupendous stone forts and earthen entrenchments\r\nthat guarded cliffs and mountain passes. The name of Erin recalls the\r\nancient inhabitants, who lived on under the new rulers, more in number\r\nthan their conquerors. The Gaels gave their language and their\r\norganisation to the country, while many customs and traditions of the\r\nolder race lingered on and penetrated the new people.\r\n\r\nOver a thousand years of undisturbed life lay before the Gaels, from\r\nabout 300 B.C. to 800 A.D. The Roman Empire which overran Great Britain\r\nleft Ireland outside it. The barbarians who swept over the provinces of\r\nthe empire and reached to the great Roman Wall never crossed the Irish\r\nSea.\r\n\r\nOut of the grouping of the tribes there emerged a division of the\r\nisland into districts made up of many peoples. Each of the provinces\r\nlater known as Ulster, Leinster, Munster and Connacht had its stretch\r\nof seaboard and harbours, its lakes and rivers for fishing, its\r\nmountain strongholds, its hill pastures, and its share of the rich\r\ncentral plain, where the cattle from the mountains \"used to go in\r\ntheir running crowds to the smooth plains of the province, towards\r\ntheir sheds and their full cattle-fields.\" All met in the middle of\r\nthe island, at the Hill of Usnech, where the Stone of Division still\r\nstands. There the high-king held his court, as the chief lord in the\r\nconfederation of the many states. The rich lands of Meath were the\r\nhigh-king's domain.\r\n\r\nHeroic tales celebrate the prehistoric conflicts as of giants by which\r\nthe peoples fixed the boundaries of their power. They tell of Conor\r\nMac Nessa who began to reign in the year that Mark Antony and\r\nCleopatra died, and of his sister's son Cuchulain, the champion of the\r\nnorth, who went out to battle from the vast entrenchments still seen\r\nin Emain Macha near Armagh. Against him Queen Maeve gathered at her\r\nmajestic fort of Rathcroghan in Roscommon fifteen hundred royal\r\nmercenaries and Gaulish soldiers--a woman comely and white-faced, with\r\ngold yellow hair, her crimson cloak fastened at the breast with a gold\r\npin, and a spear flaming in her hand, as she led her troops across the\r\nBoyne. The battles of the heroes on the Boyne and the fields of Louth,\r\nthe thronged entrenchments that thicken round the Gap of the North and\r\nthe mountain pass from Dundalk and Newry into the plains of Armagh and\r\nTyrone, show how the soldiers' line of march was the same from the\r\ndays of Cuchulain to those of William of Orange. The story tells how\r\nthe whole island shared in the great conflict, to the extreme point of\r\nMunster, where a rival of Cuchulain, Curoi son of Dare, had sent his\r\nknights and warriors through all Ireland to seek out the greatest\r\nstones for his fortress, on a shelf of rock over two thousand feet\r\nabove the sea near Tralee. The Dublin Museum preserves relics of that\r\nheroic time, the trappings of war-chariots and horses, arms and\r\nornaments.\r\n\r\nAmid such conflicts the Connacht kings pressed eastward from Usnech to\r\nTara, and fixed there the centre of Irish life.\r\n\r\nThe Gaelic conquerors had entered on a wealthy land. Irish chroniclers\r\ntold of a vast antiquity, with a shadowy line of monarchs reaching\r\nback, as they boasted, for some two thousand years before Christ: they\r\nhad legends of lakes springing forth in due order; of lowlands cleared\r\nof wood, the appearance of rivers, the making of roads and causeways,\r\nthe first digging of wells: of the making of forts; of invasions and\r\nbattles and plagues. They told of the smelting of gold near the Liffey\r\nabout 1500 B.C. and of the Wicklow artificer who made cups and\r\nbrooches of gold and silver, and silver shields, and golden chains for\r\nthe necks of kings; and of the discovery of dyes, purple and blue and\r\ngreen, and how the ranks of men were distinguished henceforth by the\r\ncolour of their raiment. They had traditions of foreign trade--of an\r\nartificer drowned while bringing golden ore from Spain, and of torques\r\nof gold from oversea, and of a lady's hair all ablaze with Alpine gold.\r\nLater researches have in fact shown that Irish commerce went back some\r\nfifteen hundred years before our era, that it was the most famous\r\ngold-producing country of the west, that mines of copper and silver\r\nwere worked, and that a race of goldsmiths probably carried on the\r\nmanufacture of bronze and gold on what is now the bog of Cullen. Some\r\nfive hundred golden ornaments of old times have been gathered together\r\nin the Dublin Museum in the last eighty years, a scanty remnant of what\r\nhave been lost or melted down; their weight is five hundred and seventy\r\nounces against a weight of twenty ounces in the British Museum from\r\nEngland, Scotland, and Wales.\r\n\r\nThe earth too was fruitful. The new settlers, who used iron tools\r\ninstead of bronze, could clear forests and open plains for tillage.\r\nAgriculture was their pride, and their legends told of stretches of\r\ncorn so great that deer could shelter in them from the hounds, and\r\nnobles and queens drove chariots along their far-reaching lines, while\r\nmultitudes of reapers were at work cutting the heads of the grain with\r\nthe little sickles which we may still see in the Dublin Museum.\r\n\r\nBut to the Irish the main interest of the Gaels lies in their\r\nconception of how to create an enduring state or nation.\r\n\r\nThe tribal system has been much derided as the mark of a savage\r\npeople, or at least of a race unable to advance beyond political\r\ninfancy into a real national existence. This was not true of the\r\nGaels. Their essential idea of a state, and the mode of its government\r\nand preservation, was different from that of mediaeval Europe, but it\r\nwas not uncivilised.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Empire stamped on the minds of its subject peoples, and on\r\nthe Teutonic barbarians who became its heirs, the notion of a state\r\nas an organisation held together, defended, governed and policed, by a\r\ncentral ruler; while the sovereign was supreme in the domain of force\r\nand maintenance of order, whatever lay outside that domain--art,\r\nlearning, history and the like--were secondary matters which might be\r\nleft to the people. The essential life of the nation came to be\r\nexpressed in the will and power of its master.\r\n\r\nThe Gaelic idea was a wholly different one. The law with them was the\r\nlaw of the people. They never lost their trust in it. Hence they never\r\nexalted a central authority, for their law needed no such sanction.\r\nWhile the code was one for the whole race, the administration on the\r\nother hand was divided into the widest possible range of\r\nself-governing communities, which were bound together in a willing\r\nfederation. The forces of union were not material but spiritual, and\r\nthe life of the people consisted not in its military cohesion but in\r\nits joint spiritual inheritance--in the union of those who shared the\r\nsame tradition, the same glorious memory of heroes, the same\r\nunquestioned law, and the same pride of literature. Such an instinct\r\nof national life was neither rude nor contemptible, nor need we\r\ndespise it because it was opposed to the theory of the middle ages in\r\nEurope. At the least the Irish tribal scheme of government contained\r\nas much promise of human virtue and happiness as the feudal scheme\r\nwhich became later the political creed of England, but which was never\r\naccepted in Ireland. Irish history can only be understood by realising\r\nthis intense national life with its sure basis on the broad\r\nself-government of the people.\r\n\r\nEach tribe was supreme within its own borders; it elected its own\r\nchief, and could depose him if he acted against law. The land belonged\r\nto the whole community, which kept exact pedigrees of the families who\r\nhad a right to share in the ground for tillage or in the mountain\r\npasturage; and the chief had no power over the soil save as the\r\nelected trustee of the people. The privileges of the various chiefs,\r\njudges, captains, historians, poets, and so on, were handed down from\r\ngeneration to generation. In all these matters no external power could\r\ninterfere. The tribe owed to the greater tribe above it nothing but\r\ncertain fixed dues, such as aid in road-making, in war, in ransom of\r\nprisoners and the like.\r\n\r\nThe same right of self-government extended through the whole hierarchy\r\nof states up to the Ardri or high-king at the head. The \"hearth of\r\nTara\" was the centre of all the Gaelic states, and the demesne of the\r\nArdri. \"This then is my fostermother,\" said the ancient sage, \"the\r\nisland in which ye are, even Ireland, and the familiar knee of this\r\nisland is the hill on which ye are, namely, Tara.\" There the Ardri was\r\ncrowned at the pillar-post. At Tara, \"the fort of poets and learned\r\nmen,\" the people of all Ireland gathered at the beginning of each\r\nhigh-king's reign, and were entertained for seven days and\r\nnights--kings and ollaves together round the high-king, warriors and\r\nreavers, together, the youths and maidens and the proud foolish folk\r\nin the chambers round the doors, while outside was for young men and\r\nmaidens because their mirth used to entertain them. Huge earthen banks\r\nstill mark the site of the great Hall, seven hundred and sixty feet\r\nlong and ninety feet wide, with seven doors to east and as many more\r\nto west; where kings and chiefs sat each under his own shield, in\r\ncrimson cloaks with gold brooches, with girdles and shoes of gold, and\r\nspears with golden sockets and rivets of red bronze. The Ardri,\r\nsupreme lord and arbitrator among them, was surrounded by his\r\ncouncillors--the law-men or brehons, the bards and chroniclers, and\r\nthe druids, teachers and men of science. He was the representative of\r\nthe whole national life. But his power rested on the tradition of the\r\npeople and on the consent of the tribes. He could impose no new law;\r\nhe could demand no service outside the law.\r\n\r\nThe political bond of union, which seemed so loose, drew all its\r\nstrength from a body of national tradition, and a universal code of\r\nlaw, which represented as it were the common mind of the people, the\r\nspontaneous creation of the race. Separate and independent as the\r\ntribes were, all accepted the one code which had been fashioned in the\r\ncourse of ages by the genius of the people. The same law was recited\r\nin every tribal assembly. The same traditions and genealogies bound\r\nthe tribes together as having a single heritage of heroic descent and\r\nfame. The preservation of their common history was the concern of the\r\nwhole people. One of the tales pictures their gathering at Tara, when\r\nbefore the men of Ireland the ancients related their history, and\r\nIreland's chief scholars heard and corrected them by the best\r\ntradition. \"Victory and blessings attend you, noble sirs,\" the men of\r\nErin said; \"for such instruction it was meet that we should gather\r\nourselves together.\" And at the reciting of the historic glories of\r\ntheir past, the whole congregation arose up together \"for in their\r\neyes it was an augmenting of the spirit and an enlargement of the\r\nmind.\"\r\n\r\nTo preserve this national tradition a learned class was carefully\r\ntrained. There were schools of lawyers to expound the law; schools of\r\nhistorians to preserve the genealogies, the boundaries of lands, and\r\nthe rights of classes and families; and schools of poets to recite the\r\ntraditions of the race. The learned men were paid at first by the\r\ngifts of the people, but the chief among them were later endowed with\r\na settled share of the tribe land in perpetuity. So long as the\r\nfamily held the land, they were bound to train up in each generation\r\nthat one of the household who was most fit to carry on learning, and\r\nthus for centuries long lines of distinguished men added fame to their\r\ncountry and drew to its schools students from far and wide. Through\r\ntheir work the spirit of the Irish found national expression in a code\r\nof law which showed not only extraordinarily acute and trained\r\nintelligence but a true sense of equity, in a literary language of\r\ngreat richness and of the utmost musical beauty, and in a system of\r\nmetrical rules for poets shaped with infinite skill. The Irish nation\r\nhad a pride in its language beyond any people in Europe outside of the\r\nGreeks and Romans.\r\n\r\nWhile each tribe had its schools, these were linked together in a\r\nnational system. Professors of every school were free of the island;\r\nit was the warrior's duty to protect them as they moved from court to\r\ncourt. An ancient tale tells how the chiefs of Emain near Armagh\r\nplaced sentinels along the Gap of the North to turn back every poet\r\nwho sought to leave the country and to bring on their way with honour\r\nevery one who sought to enter in. There was no stagnation where\r\ncompetition extended over the whole island. The greatest of the\r\nteachers were given the dignity of \"Professors of all the Gaels.\"\r\nLearned men in their degrees ranked with kings and chiefs, and\r\nhigh-professors sat by the high-king and shared his honours. The king,\r\nsaid the laws, \"could by his mere word decide against every class of\r\npersons except those of the two orders of religion and learning, who\r\nare of equal value with himself.\"\r\n\r\nIt is in this exaltation of learning in the national life that we must\r\nlook for the real significance of Irish history--the idea of a society\r\nloosely held in a political sense, but bound together in a spiritual\r\nunion. The assemblies which took place in every province and every\r\npetty state were the guarantees of the national civilization. They were\r\nperiodical exhibitions of everything the people esteemed--democracy,\r\naristocracy, king-craft, literature, tradition, art, commerce, law,\r\nsport, religion, display, even rustic buffoonery. The years between one\r\nfestival and another were spent in serious preparation for the next; a\r\nmultitude of maxims were drawn up to direct the conduct of the people.\r\nSo deeply was their importance felt that the Irish kept the tradition\r\ndiligently, and even in the darkest times of their history, down to the\r\nseventeenth century, still gathered to \"meetings on hills\" to exercise\r\ntheir law and hear their learned men.\r\n\r\nIn the time of the Roman Empire, therefore, the Irish looked on\r\nthemselves as one race, obedient to one law, united in one culture and\r\nbelonging to one country. Their unity is symbolised by the great\r\ngenealogical compilations in which all the Gaels are traced to one\r\nancestry, and in the collections of topographical legends dealing with\r\nhundreds of places, where every nook and corner of the island is\r\nsupposed to be of interest to the whole of Ireland. The tribal\r\nboundaries were limits to the material power of a chief and to that\r\nonly: they were no barriers to the national thought or union. The\r\nlearned man of the clan was the learned man of the Gaelic race. By all\r\nthe higher matters of language and learning, of equity and history,\r\nthe people of Ireland were one. A noble figure told the unity of\r\ntheir land within the circuit of the ocean. The Three Waves of Erin,\r\nthey said, smote upon the shore with a foreboding roar when danger\r\nthreatened the island; Cleena's wave called to Munster at an inlet\r\nnear Cork, while Tonn Rury at Dundrum and Tonn Tuaithe at the mouth of\r\nthe Bann sounded to the men of Ulster.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of the Irish system are apparent. The numerous small\r\nterritories were tempted, like larger European states, to raid\r\nborders, to snatch land or booty, and to suffer some expense of\r\ntrained soldiers. Candidates for the chiefdom had to show their\r\nfitness, and \"a young lord's first spoil\" was a necessary exploit.\r\nThere were wild plundering raids in the summer nights; disorders were\r\nmultiplied. A country divided in government was weakened for purposes\r\nof offence, or for joint action in military matters. These evils were\r\ngenuine, but they have been exaggerated. Common action was hindered,\r\nnot mainly by human contentions, but by the forests and marshes, lakes\r\nand rivers in flood that lay over a country heavy with Atlantic\r\nclouds. Riots and forays there were, among a martial race and strong\r\nmen of hot passions, but Ireland was in fact no prominent example of\r\nmediaeval anarchy or disorder. Local feuds were no greater than those\r\nwhich afflicted England down to the Norman Conquest and long after it;\r\nand which marked the life of European states and cities through the\r\nmiddle ages. The professional war bands of Fiana that hired themselves\r\nout from time to time were controlled and recognised by law, and had\r\ntheir special organisation and rites and rules of war. It has been\r\nsupposed that in the passion of tribal disputes men mostly perished by\r\nmurder and battle-slaughter, and the life of every generation was by\r\nviolence shortened to less than the common average of thirty years.\r\nIrish genealogies prove on the contrary that the generations must be\r\ncounted at from thirty-three to thirty-six years: the tale of kings,\r\njudges, poets, and householders who died peacefully in an honoured old\r\nage, or from some natural accident, outruns the list of sudden murders\r\nor deaths in battle. Historical evidence moreover shows us a country\r\nof widening cornfields, or growing commerce, where wealth was\r\ngathered, where art and learning swept like a passion over the people,\r\nand schools covered the land. Such industries and virtues do not\r\nflourish in regions given over to savage strife. And it is significant\r\nthat Irish chiefs who made great wars hired professional soldiers from\r\noversea.\r\n\r\nIf the disorders of the Irish system have been magnified its benefits\r\nhave been forgotten. All Irish history proved that the division of the\r\nland into separate military districts, where the fighting men knew\r\nevery foot of ground, and had an intense local patriotism, gave them a\r\npower of defence which made conquest by the foreigner impossible; he\r\nhad first to exterminate the entire people. The same division into\r\nadministrative districts gave also a singular authority to law. In\r\nmediaeval states, however excellent were the central codes, they were\r\nonly put in force just so far as the king had power to compel men to\r\nobey, and that power often fell very far short of the nominal\r\nboundaries of his kingdom. But in Ireland every community and every\r\nindividual was interested in maintaining the law of the people, the\r\nprotection of the common folk; nor were its landmarks ever submerged\r\nor destroyed. Irish land laws, for example, in spite of the changes\r\nthat gradually covered the land with fenced estates, did actually\r\npreserve through all the centuries popular rights--fixity of rates for\r\nthe land, fixity of tenure, security of improvement, refusal to allow\r\ngreat men to seize forests for their chase: under this people's law no\r\nPeasant Revolt ever arose, nor any rising of the poor against their\r\nlords. Rights of inheritance, due solemnities of election, were\r\naccurately preserved. The authority and continuity of Irish law was\r\nrecognised by wondering Englishmen--\"They observe and keep such laws\r\nand statutes which they make upon hills in their country firm and\r\nstable, without breaking them for any favour or reward,\" said an\r\nEnglish judge. \"The Irish are more fearful to offend the law than the\r\nEnglish or any other nation whatsoever.\"\r\n\r\nThe tribal system had another benefit for Irishmen--the diffusion of a\r\nhigh intelligence among the whole people. A varied education, spread\r\nover many centres, fertilized the general life. Every countryside that\r\nadministered its own affairs must of needs possess a society rich in\r\nall the activities that go to make up a full community--chiefs,\r\ndoctors, soldiers, judges, historians, poets, artists and craftsmen,\r\nskilled herds, tillers of the ground, raisers and trainers of horses,\r\ninnkeepers, huntsmen, merchants, dyers and weavers and tanners. In\r\nsome sequestered places in Ireland we can still trace the settlements\r\nmade by Irish communities. They built no towns nor needed any in the\r\nmodern sense. But entrenchments of earth, or \"raths,\" thickly gathered\r\ntogether, mark a site where men lived in close association. Roads and\r\npaths great and small were maintained according to law, and boats\r\ncarried travellers along rivers and lakes. So frequent were the\r\njourneys of scholars, traders, messengers from tribe to tribe, men\r\ngathering to public assemblies, craftsmen, dealers in hides and wool,\r\npoets, men and women making their circuit, that there was made in\r\nearly time a \"road-book\" or itinerary, perhaps some early form of map,\r\nof Ireland.\r\n\r\nThis life of opportunity in thickly congregated country societies gave\r\nto Ireland its wide culture, and the incredible number of scholars and\r\nartificers that it poured out over Europe with generous ardour. The\r\nmultitudinous centres of discussion scattered over the island, and the\r\nrapid intercourse of all these centres one with another, explain how\r\nlearning broadened, and how Christianity spread over the land like a\r\nflood. It was to these country settlements that the Irish owed the\r\nrichness of their civilisation, the generosity of their learning, and\r\nthe passion of their patriotism.\r\n\r\nIreland was a land then as now of intense contrasts, where equilibrium\r\nwas maintained by opposites, not by a perpetual tending towards the\r\nmiddle course. In things political and social the Irish showed a\r\nconservatism that no intercourse could shake, side by side with eager\r\nreadiness and great success in grasping the latest progress in arts or\r\ncommerce. In their literature strikingly modern thoughts jostle\r\nagainst the most primitive crudeness; \"Vested interests are shameless\"\r\nwas one of their old observations. In Ireland the old survived beside\r\nthe new, and as the new came by free assimilation old and new did not\r\nconflict. The balance of opposites gave colour and force to their\r\ncivilisation, and Ireland until the thirteenth century and very\r\nlargely until the seventeenth century, escaped or survived the\r\nsuccessive steam rollings that reduced Europe to nearly one common\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nIn the Irish system we may see the shaping of a true democracy--a\r\nsociety in which ever-broadening masses of the people are made\r\nintelligent sharers in the national life, and conscious guardians of\r\nits tradition. Their history is throughout a record of the nobility of\r\nthat experiment. It would be a mechanical theory of human life which\r\ndenied to the people of Ireland the praise of a true patriotism or the\r\nessential spirit of a nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nIRELAND AND EUROPE\r\n\r\n_c._ 100--_c._ 600\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Roman Agricola had proposed the conquest of Ireland on the ground\r\nthat it would have a good effect on Britain by removing the spectacle\r\nof liberty. But there was no Roman conquest. The Irish remained\r\noutside the Empire, as free as the men of Norway and Sweden. They\r\nshowed that to share in the trade, the culture, and the civilisation\r\nof an empire, it is not necessary to be subject to its armies or lie\r\nunder its police control. While the neighbouring peoples received a\r\ncivilisation imposed by violence and maintained by compulsion, the\r\nIrish were free themselves to choose those things which were suited to\r\ntheir circumstances and character, and thus to shape for their people\r\na liberal culture, democratic and national.\r\n\r\nIt is important to observe what it was that tribal Ireland chose, and\r\nwhat it rejected.\r\n\r\nThere was frequent trade, for from the first century Irish ports were\r\nwell known to merchants of the Empire, sailing across the Gaulish sea\r\nin wooden ships built to confront Atlantic gales, with high poops\r\nstanding from the water like castles, and great leathern sails--stout\r\nhulls steered by the born sailors of the Breton coasts or the lands of\r\nthe Loire and Garonne. The Irish themselves served as sailors and\r\npilots in the ocean traffic, and travelled as merchants, tourists,\r\nscholars and pilgrims. Trading-ships carried the wine of Italy and\r\nlater of Provence, in great tuns in which three men could stand\r\nupright, to the eastern and the western coasts, to the Shannon and the\r\nharbours of Down; and probably brought tin to mix with Irish copper.\r\nIreland sent out great dogs trained for war, wool, hides, all kinds of\r\nskins and furs, and perhaps gold and copper. But this material trade\r\nwas mainly important to the Irish for the other wealth that Gaul had\r\nto give--art, learning, and religion.\r\n\r\nOf art the Irish craftsmen took all that Gaul possessed--the great\r\ndecorated trumpets of bronze used in the Loire country, the fine\r\nenamelling in colours, the late-Celtic designs for ornaments of bronze\r\nand gold. Goldsmiths travelled oversea to bring back bracelets, rings,\r\ndraughtboards--\"one half of its figures are yellow gold, the others\r\nare white bronze; its woof is of pearl; it is the wonder of smiths how\r\nit was wrought.\" They borrowed afterwards interlaced ornament for\r\nmetal work and illuminated manuscripts. In such arts they outdid their\r\nteachers; their gold and enamel work has never been surpassed, and in\r\nwriting and illumination they went beyond the imperial artists of\r\nConstantinople. Their schools throughout the country handed on a great\r\ntraditional art, not transitory or local, but permanent and national.\r\n\r\nLearning was as freely imported. The Latin alphabet came over at a\r\nvery early time, and knowledge of Greek as a living tongue from\r\nMarseilles and the schools of Narbonne. By the same road from\r\nMarseilles Christianity must have come a hundred years or so before\r\nthe mission of St. Patrick--a Christianity carrying the traditions\r\nand rites and apocalypses of the East. It was from Gaul that St.\r\nPatrick afterwards sailed for his mission to Ireland. He came to a\r\nland where there were already men of erudition and \"rhetoricians\" who\r\nscoffed at his lack of education. The tribes of Ireland, free from\r\nbarbarian invasions as they had been free from Roman armies, developed\r\na culture which was not surpassed in the West or even in Italy. And\r\nthis culture, like the art, was national, spread over the whole land.\r\n\r\nBut while the Irish drew to themselves from the Empire art, learning,\r\nreligion, they never adopted anything of Roman methods of government in\r\nchurch or state. The Roman centralized authority was opposed to their\r\nwhole habit of thought and genius. They made, therefore, no change in\r\ntheir tribal administration. As early as the second century Irishmen\r\nhad learned from Gaulish landowners to divide land into estates marked\r\nout with pillar-stones which could be bought and sold, and by 700 A.D.\r\nthe country was scored with fences, and farms were freely bequeathed by\r\nwill. But these estates seem still to have been administered according\r\nto the common law of the tribe, and not to have followed the methods of\r\nRoman proprietors throughout the Empire. In the same way the foreign\r\nlearning brought into Ireland was taught through the tribal system of\r\nschools. Lay schools formed by the Druids in old time went on as\r\nbefore, where students of law and history and poetry grouped their huts\r\nround the dwelling of a famous teacher, and the poor among them begged\r\ntheir bread in the neighbourhood. The monasteries in like manner\r\ngathered their scholars within the \"rath\" or earthen entrenchment, and\r\ntaught them Latin, canon law, and divinity. Monastic and lay schools\r\nwent on side by side, as heirs together of the national tradition and\r\nlanguage. The most venerable saints, the highest ecclesiastics, were\r\nrevered also as guardians of Irish history and law, who wrote in Irish\r\nthe national tales as competent scribes and not mere copyists--men who\r\nknew all the traditions, used various sources, and shaped their story\r\nwith the independence of learning. No parallel can be found in any\r\nother country to the writing down of national epics in their pagan\r\nform many centuries after the country had become Christian. In the same\r\nway European culture was not allowed to suppress the national language;\r\nclerics as well as laymen preserved the native tongue in worship and in\r\nhymns, as at Clonmacnois where the praises of St. Columcille were sung,\r\n\"some in Latin, which was beguiling, some in Irish, fair the tale\"; and\r\nin its famous cemetery, where kings and scholars and pilgrims of all\r\nIreland came to lie, there is but one Latin inscription among over two\r\nhundred inscribed grave slabs that have been saved from the many lost.\r\n\r\nLike the learning and the art, the new worship was adapted to tribal\r\ncustom. Round the little monastic church gathered a group of huts with\r\na common refectory, the whole protected by a great rampart of earth.\r\nThe plan was familiar to all the Irish; every chief's house had such a\r\nfence, and every bardic school had its circle of thatched cells where\r\nthe scholars spent years in study and meditation. Monastic \"families\"\r\nwhich branched off from the first house were grouped under the name of\r\nthe original founder, in free federal union like that of the clans.\r\nAs no land could be wholly alienated from the tribe, territory given\r\nto the monastery was not exempted from the common law; it was ruled by\r\nabbots elected, like kings and judges of the tribe, out of the house\r\nwhich under tribal law had the right of succession; and the monks in\r\nsome cases had to pay the tribal dues for the land and send out\r\nfighting men for the hosting.\r\n\r\nNever was a church so truly national. The words used by the common\r\npeople were steeped in its imagery. In their dedications the Irish\r\ntook no names of foreign saints, but of their own holy men. St.\r\nBridgit became the \"Mary of the Gael.\" There was scarcely a boundary\r\nfelt between the divine country and the earthly, so entirely was the\r\nspiritual life commingled with the national. A legend told that St.\r\nColman one day saw his monks reaping the wheat sorrowfully; it was the\r\nday of the celebration of Telltown fair, the yearly assembly of all\r\nIreland before the high-king: he prayed, and angels came to him at\r\nonce from heaven and performed three races for the toiling monks after\r\nthe manner of the national feast.\r\n\r\nThe religion which thus sprang out of the heart of a people and\r\npenetrated every part of their national life, shone with a radiant\r\nspiritual fervour. The prayers and hymns that survive from the early\r\nchurch are inspired by an exalted devotion, a profound and original\r\npiety, which won the veneration of every people who came into touch\r\nwith the people of Ireland. On mountain cliffs, in valleys, by the\r\nwater-side, on secluded islands, lie ruins of their churches and\r\noratories, small in size though made by masons who could fit and\r\ndovetail into one another great stones from ten to seventeen feet in\r\nlength; the little buildings preserved for centuries some ancient\r\ntradition of apostolic measurements, and in their narrow and austere\r\ndimensions, and their intimate solemnity, were fitted to the tribal\r\ncommunities and to their unworldly and spiritual worship. An old song\r\ntells of a saint building, with a wet cloak about him--\r\n\r\n    \"Hand on a stone, hand lifted up,\r\n    Knee bent to set a rock,\r\n    Eyes shedding tears, other lamentation,\r\n    And mouth praying.\"\r\n\r\nPiety did not always vanquish the passions of a turbulent age. There\r\nwere local quarrels and battles. In some hot temporal controversy, in\r\nsome passionate religious rivalry, a monastic \"rath\" may have fallen\r\nback to its original use as a fort. Plunderers fell on a trading\r\ncentre like Clonmacnois, where goods landed from the Shannon for\r\ntransport across country offered a prize. Such things have been known\r\nin other lands. But it is evident that disturbances were not universal\r\nor continuous. The extraordinary work of learning carried out in the\r\nmonastic lands, the sanctuary given in them for hundreds of years to\r\ninnumerable scholars not of Ireland alone, shows the large peace that\r\nmust have prevailed on their territories.\r\n\r\nThe national tradition of monastic and lay schools preserved to Erin\r\nwhat was lost in the rest of Europe, a learned class of laymen.\r\nCulture was as frequent and honourable in the Irish chief or warrior\r\nas in the cleric. Gaiety and wit were prized. Oral tradition told for\r\nmany centuries of a certain merryman long ago, and yet he was a\r\nChristian, who could make all men he ever saw laugh however sad they\r\nwere, so that even his skull on a high stone in the churchyard brought\r\nmirth to sorrowful souls.\r\n\r\nWe must remember, too, that by the Irish system certain forms of\r\nhostility were absolutely shut out. There is not a single instance in\r\nIrish history of the conflicts between a monastery and its lay\r\ndependents which were so frequent on the continent and in England--as,\r\nfor example, at St. Albans, where the monks paved their church with\r\nthe querns of the townsfolk to compel them to bring their corn to the\r\nabbey mill. Again, the broad tolerance of the church in Ireland never\r\nallowed any persecution for religion's sake, and thus shut the door on\r\nthe worst form of human cruelty. At the invasion of the Normans a\r\nNorman bishop mocked to the archbishop of Cashel at the imperfection\r\nof a church like the Irish which could boast of no martyr. \"The\r\nIrish,\" answered the archbishop, \"have never been accustomed to\r\nstretch forth their hands against the saints of God, but now a people\r\nis come into this country that is accustomed and knows how to make\r\nmartyrs. Now Ireland too will have martyrs.\" Finally, the Irish\r\nchurch never became, as in other lands, the servant, the ally, or the\r\nmaster of the state. It was the companion of the people, the heart of\r\nthe nation. To its honour it never served as the instrument of\r\npolitical dominion, and it never was degraded from first to last by a\r\nwar of religion.\r\n\r\nThe free tribes of Ireland had therefore by some native instinct of\r\ndemocratic life rejected for their country the organisation of the\r\nRoman state, and had only taken the highest forms of its art,\r\nlearning, and religion, to enrich their ancient law and tradition: and\r\nthrough their own forms of social life they had made this culture\r\nuniversal among the people, and national. Such was the spectacle of\r\nliberty which the imperial Agricola had feared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE IRISH MISSION\r\n\r\n_c._ 560--_c._ 1000\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Roman Empire brought to the Irish people new dangers\r\nand new opportunities. Goths and Vandals, Burgundians and Franks,\r\npoured west over Europe to the Atlantic shore, and south across the\r\nMediterranean to Africa; while the English were pressing northward\r\nover Great Britain, driving back the Celts and creating a pagan and\r\nTeutonic England. Once more Ireland lay the last unconquered land of\r\nthe West.\r\n\r\nThe peoples that lay in a circle round the shores of the German Ocean\r\nwere in the thick of human affairs, nations to right and left of them,\r\nall Europe to expand in. From the time when their warriors fell on the\r\nRoman Empire they rejoiced in a thousand years of uninterrupted war\r\nand conquest; and for the thousand years that followed traders, now\r\nfrom this shore of the German sea and now from that, have fought and\r\ntrafficked over the whole earth.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, on the other hand, we see a race of the bravest warriors\r\nthat ever fought, who had pushed on over the Gaulish sea to the very\r\nmarge and limit of the world. Close at their back now lay the German\r\ninvaders of Britain--a new wave of the human tide always flowing\r\nwestward. Before them stretched the Atlantic, darkness and chaos; no\r\nboundary known to that sea. Even now as we stand to the far westward\r\non the gloomy heights of Donegal, where the very grass and trees have\r\na blacker hue, we seem to have entered into a vast antiquity, where it\r\nwould be little wonder to see in the sombre solitude some strange\r\nshape of the primeval world, some huge form of primitive man's\r\nimagination. So closely did Infinity compass these people round that\r\nwhen the Irish sailor--St. Brendan or another--launched his coracle on\r\nthe illimitable waves, in face of the everlasting storm, he might seem\r\nto pass over the edge of the earth into the vast Eternity where space\r\nand time were not. We see the awful fascination of the immeasurable\r\nflood in the story of the three Irishmen that were washed on the\r\nshores of Cornwall and carried to King AElfred. \"They came,\" AElfred\r\ntells us in his chronicle, \"in a boat without oars from Hibernia,\r\nwhence they had stolen away because for the love of God they would be\r\non pilgrimage--they recked not where. The boat in which they fared was\r\nwrought of three hides and a half, and they took with them enough meat\r\nfor seven nights.\"\r\n\r\nUltimately withdrawn from the material business of the continent\r\nnothing again drew back the Irish to any share in the affairs of\r\nEurope save a spiritual call--a call of religion, of learning, or of\r\nliberty. The story of the Irish mission shows how they answered to\r\nsuch a call.\r\n\r\nThe Teutonic invaders stopped at the Irish Sea. At the fall of the\r\nEmpire, therefore, Ireland did not share in the ruin of its\r\ncivilisation. And while all continental roads were interrupted,\r\ntraffic from Irish ports still passed safely to Gaul over the ocean\r\nroutes. Ireland therefore not only preserved her culture unharmed,\r\nbut the way lay open for her missionaries to carry back to Europe the\r\nknowledge which she had received from it. In that mission we may see\r\nthe strength and the spirit of the tribal civilisation.\r\n\r\nTwo great leaders of the Irish mission were Columcille in Great\r\nBritain and Columbanus in Europe. In all Irish history there is no\r\ngreater figure than St. Columcille--statesman and patriot, poet,\r\nscholar, and saint. After founding thirty-seven monasteries in\r\nIreland, from Derry on the northern coast to Durrow near the Munster\r\nborder, he crossed the sea in 563 to set up on the bare island of Hii\r\nor Iona a group of reed-thatched huts peopled with Irish monks. In\r\nthat wild debatable land, swept by heathen raids, amid the ruins of\r\nChristian settlements, began a work equally astonishing from the\r\nreligious and the political point of view. The heathen Picts had\r\nmarched westward to the sea, destroying the Celtic churches. The pagan\r\nEnglish had set up in 547 a monarchy in Northumbria and the Lowlands,\r\nthreatening alike the Picts, the Irish or \"Scot\" settlements along the\r\ncoast, and the Celts of Strathclyde. Against this world of war\r\nColumcille opposed the idea of a peaceful federation of peoples in the\r\nbond of Christian piety. He converted the king of the Picts at\r\nInverness in 565, and spread Irish monasteries from Strathspey to the\r\nDee, and from the Dee to the Tay. On the western shores about Cantyre\r\nhe restored the Scot settlement from Ireland which was later to give\r\nits name to Scotland, and consecrated as king the Irish Aidan,\r\nancestor of the kings of Scotland and England. He established\r\nfriendship with the Britons of Strathclyde. From his cell at Iona he\r\ndominated the new federation of Picts and Britons and Irish on both\r\nsides of the sea--the greatest missionary that Ireland ever sent out\r\nto proclaim the gathering of peoples in free association through the\r\npower of human brotherhood, learning, and religion.\r\n\r\nFor thirty-four years Columcille ruled as abbot in Iona, the high\r\nleader of the Celtic world. He watched the wooden ships with great\r\nsails that crossed from shore to shore; he talked with mariners\r\nsailing south from the Orkneys, and others coming north from the Loire\r\nwith their tuns of wine, who told him European tidings, and how a\r\ntown in Istria had been wrecked by earthquake. His large\r\nstatesmanship, his lofty genius, the passionate and poetic temperament\r\nthat filled men with awe and reverence, the splendid voice and stately\r\nfigure that seemed almost miraculous gifts, the power of inspiring\r\nlove that brought dying men to see his face once more before they fell\r\nat his feet in death, give a surpassing dignity and beauty to his\r\nlife. \"He could never spend the space of even one hour without study\r\nor prayer or writing, or some other holy occupation ... and still in\r\nall these he was beloved by all.\" \"Seasons and storms he perceived, he\r\nharmonised the moon's race with the branching sun, he was skilful in\r\nthe course of the sea, he would count the stars of heaven.\" He\r\ndesired, one of his poems tells us, \"to search all the books that\r\nwould be good for any soul\"; and with his own hand he copied, it is\r\nsaid, three hundred books, sitting with open cell door, where the\r\nbrethren, one with his butcher's knife, one with his milk pail,\r\nstopped to ask a blessing as they passed.\r\n\r\nAfter his death the Irish monks carried his work over the whole of\r\nEngland. A heathen land lay before them, for the Roman missionaries\r\nestablished in 597 by Augustine in Canterbury, speaking no English and\r\nhating \"barbarism,\" made little progress, and after some reverses were\r\npractically confined to Kent. The first cross of the English\r\nborderland was set up in 635 by men from Iona on a heather moorland\r\ncalled the Heaven-field, by the ramparts of the Roman Wall. Columban\r\nmonks made a second Iona at Lindisfarne, with its church of hewn oak\r\nthatched with reeds after Irish tradition in sign of poverty and\r\nlowliness, and with its famous school of art and learning. They taught\r\nthe English writing, and gave them the letters which were used among\r\nthem till the Norman Conquest. Labour and learning went hand in hand.\r\nFrom the king's court nobles came, rejoicing to change the brutalities\r\nof war for the plough, the forge-hammer, the winnowing fan: waste\r\nplaces were reclaimed, the ports were crowded with boats, and\r\nmonasteries gave shelter to travellers. For a hundred years wherever\r\nthe monks of Iona passed men ran to be signed by their hand and\r\nblessed by their voice. Their missionaries wandered on foot over\r\nmiddle England and along the eastern coast and even touched the\r\nChannel in Sussex. In 662 there was only one bishop in the whole of\r\nEngland who was not of Irish consecration, and this bishop, Agilberct\r\nof Wessex, was a Frenchman who had been trained for years in Ireland.\r\nThe great school of Malmesbury in Wessex was founded by an Irishman,\r\nas that of Lindisfarne had been in the north.\r\n\r\nFor the first time also Ireland became known to Englishmen. Fleets of\r\nships bore students and pilgrims, who forsook their native land for\r\nthe sake of divine studies. The Irish most willingly received them\r\nall, supplying to them without charge food and books and teaching,\r\nwelcoming them in every school from Derry to Lismore, making for them\r\na \"Saxon Quarter\" in the old university of Armagh. Under the influence\r\nof the Irish teachers the spirit of racial bitterness was checked, and\r\na new intercourse sprang up between English, Picts, Britons, and\r\nIrish. For a moment it seemed as though the British islands were to be\r\ndrawn into one peaceful confederation and communion and a common\r\nworship bounded only by the ocean. The peace of Columcille, the\r\nfellowship of learning and of piety, rested on the peoples.\r\n\r\nColumcille had been some dozen years in Iona when Columbanus (_c._\r\n575) left Bangor on the Belfast Lough, leading twelve Irish monks clad\r\nin white homespun, with long hair falling on their shoulders, and\r\nbooks hanging from their waists in leathern satchels. They probably\r\nsailed in one of the merchant ships trading from the Loire. Crossing\r\nGaul to the Vosges Columbanus founded his monastery of Luxeuil among\r\nthe ruined heaps of a Roman city, once the meeting-place of great\r\nhighways from Italy and France, now left by the barbarians a\r\nwilderness for wild beasts. Other houses branched out into France and\r\nSwitzerland. Finally he founded his monastery of Bobio in the\r\nApennines, where he died in 615.\r\n\r\nA stern ascetic, aflame with religious passion, a finished scholar\r\nbringing from Ireland a knowledge of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, of\r\nrhetoric, geometry, and poetry, and a fine taste, Columbanus battled\r\nfor twenty years with the vice and ignorance of a half-pagan\r\nBurgundy. Scornful of ease, indifferent to danger, astonished at the\r\napathy of Italy as compared with the zeal of Ireland in teaching, he\r\nargued and denounced with \"the freedom of speech which accords with\r\nthe custom of my country.\" The passion of his piety so awed the\r\npeoples, that for a time it seemed as if the rule of Columbanus might\r\noutdo that of St. Benedict. It was told that in Rome Gregory the Great\r\nreceived him, and as Columbanus lay prostrate in the church the Pope\r\npraised God in his heart for having given such great power to so small\r\na man. Instantly the fiery saint, detecting the secret thought, rose\r\nfrom his prayer to repudiate the slight: \"Brother, he who depreciates\r\nthe work depreciates the Author.\"\r\n\r\nFor a hundred years before Columbanus there had been Irish pilgrims\r\nand bishops in Gaul and Italy. But it was his mission that first\r\nbrought the national patriotism of Ireland into conflict with the\r\norganisation of Rome in Europe. Christianity had come to Ireland from\r\nthe East--tradition said from St. John, who was then, and is still,\r\nheld in special veneration by the Irish; his flower, St. John's wort,\r\nhad for them peculiar virtues, and from it came, it was said, the\r\nsaffron hue as the national colour for their dress. It was a national\r\npride that their date for celebrating Easter, and their Eastern\r\ntonsure from ear to ear, had come to them from St. John. Peter loved\r\nJesus, they said, but it was John that Jesus loved--\"the youth John,\r\nthe foster-son of his own bosom\"--\"John of the Breast.\" It was with a\r\nvery passion of loyalty that they clung to a national church which\r\nlinked them to the beloved apostle, and which was the close bond of\r\ntheir whole race, dear to them as the supreme expression of their\r\ntemporal and spiritual freedom, now illustrious beyond all others in\r\nEurope for the roll of its saints and of its scholars, and ennobled by\r\nthe company of its patriots and the glory of Columcille. The tonsure\r\nand the Easter of Columbanus, however, shocked foreign ecclesiastics\r\nas contrary to the discipline of Rome, and he was required to renounce\r\nthem. He vehemently protested his loyalty to St. John, to St.\r\nColumcille, and to the church of his fathers. It was an unequal\r\nargument. Ireland, he was answered, was a small island in a far\r\ncorner of the earth: what was its people that they should fight\r\nagainst the whole world. The Europe of imperial tradition had lost\r\ncomprehension of the passion of national loyalty: all that lay outside\r\nthat tradition was \"barbarous,\" the Irish like the Saxons or the Huns.\r\n\r\nThe battle that was thus opened was the beginning of a new epoch in\r\nIrish history. St. Augustine, first archbishop of Canterbury (597),\r\nwas ordered (603) to demand obedience to himself from the Celtic\r\nchurches and the setting aside of their customs. The Welsh and the\r\nIrish refused to submit. Augustine had come to them from among the\r\nEnglish, who were still pagan, and still fighting for the\r\nextermination of the Celts, and on his lips were threats of slaughter\r\nby their armies to the disobedient. The demand was renewed sixty years\r\nlater, in a synod at Whitby in 664. By that time Christianity had been\r\ncarried over England by the Irish mission; on the other hand, the\r\nEnglish were filled with imperial dreams of conquest and supremacy.\r\nEnglish kings settled on the Roman province began to imitate the\r\nglories of Rome, to have the Roman banner of purple and gold carried\r\nbefore them, to hear the name of \"Emperor of the whole of Britain,\"\r\nand to project the final subjugation to that \"empire\" of the Celt and\r\nPictish peoples. The Roman organisation fell in with their habits of\r\ngovernment and their ambitions. In the synod the tone of imperial\r\ncontempt made itself heard against those marked out for\r\nconquest--Celts \"rude and barbarous\"--\"Picts and Britons, accomplices\r\nin obstinacy in those two remote islands of the world.\" \"Your father\r\nColumba,\" \"of rustic simplicity\" said the English leader, had \"that\r\nColumba of yours,\" like Peter, the keeping of the keys of heaven? With\r\nthese first bitter words, with the condemnation of the Irish customs,\r\nand the sailing away of the Irish monks from Lindisfarne, discord\r\nbegan to enter in. Slowly and with sorrow the Irish in the course of\r\nsixty years abandoned their traditional customs and adopted the Roman\r\nEaster. But the work of Columcille was undone, and the spiritual bond\r\nby which the peoples had been united was for ever loosened. English\r\narmies marched ravaging over the north, one of them into Ireland\r\n(684), \"wasting that harmless nation which had always been most\r\nfriendly to the English, not sparing even churches or monasteries.\"\r\nThe gracious peace which had bound the races for a hundred and twenty\r\nyears was broken, and constant wars again divided Picts, Scots,\r\nBritons, and Angles.\r\n\r\nIreland, however, for four hundred years to come still poured out\r\nmissionaries to Europe. They passed through England to northern France\r\nand the Netherlands; across the Gaulish sea and by the Loire to middle\r\nFrance; by the Rhine and the way of Luxeuil they entered Switzerland;\r\nand westward they reached out to the Elbe and the Danube, sending\r\nmissionaries to Old Saxony, Thuringia, Bavaria, Salzburg and\r\nCarinthia; southwards they crossed the Alps into Italy, to Lucca,\r\nFiesole, Rome, the hills of Naples, and Tarentum. Their monasteries\r\nformed rest-houses for travellers through France and Germany. Europe\r\nitself was too narrow for their ardour, and they journeyed to\r\nJerusalem, settled in Carthage, and sailed to the discovery of\r\nIceland. No church of any land has so noble a record in the\r\nastonishing work of its teachers, as they wandered over the ruined\r\nprovinces of the empire among the pagan tribes of the invaders. In the\r\nHighlands they taught the Picts to compose hymns in their own tongue;\r\nin a monastery founded by them in Yorkshire was trained the first\r\nEnglish poet in the new England; at St. Gall they drew up a\r\nLatin-German dictionary for the Germans of the Upper Rhine and\r\nSwitzerland, and even devised new German words to express the new\r\nideas of Christian civilisation; near Florence one of their saints\r\ntaught the natives how to turn the course of a river. Probably in the\r\nseventh and eighth centuries no one in western Europe spoke Greek who\r\nwas not Irish or taught by an Irishman. No land ever sent out such\r\nimpassioned teachers of learning, and Charles the Great and his\r\nsuccessors set them at the head of the chief schools throughout\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nWe can only measure the originality of the Irish mission by comparing\r\nwith it the work of other races. Roman civilisation had not inured its\r\npeople to hardship, nor given them any interest in barbarians. When\r\nAugustine in 595 was sent on the English mission he turned back with\r\nloathing, and finally took a year for his journey. In 664 no one could\r\nbe found in Rome to send to Canterbury, till in 668 Theodore was\r\nfetched from Syria; he also took a year on his way. But the Irish\r\nmissionaries feared nothing, neither hunger nor weariness nor the\r\noutlaws of the woods. Their succession never ceased. The death of one\r\napostle was but the coming of another. The English missions again\r\ncould not compare with the Irish. Every English missionary from the\r\nseventh to the ninth century had been trained under Irish teachers or\r\nhad been for years in Ireland, enveloped by the ardour of their fiery\r\nenthusiasm; when this powerful influence was set aside English mission\r\nwork died down for a thousand years or so. The Irish missionaries\r\ncontinued without a break for over six hundred years. Instead of the\r\nIrish zeal for the welfare of all peoples whatsoever, the English felt\r\na special call to preach among those \"from whom the English race had\r\nits origin,\" and their chief mission was to their own stock in Frisia.\r\nFinally, among Teutonic peoples politics went hand in hand with\r\nChristianity. The Teutons were out to conquer, and in the lust of\r\ndominion a conqueror might make religion the sign of obedience, and\r\nenforce it by fire and water, viper and sword. But the Irish had no\r\ntheory of dominion to push. A score of generations of missionaries\r\nwere bred up in the tribal communities of Ireland, where men believed\r\nin voluntary union of men in a high tradition. Their method was one of\r\npersuasion for spiritual ends alone. The conception of human life that\r\nlay behind the tribal government and the tribal church of Ireland gave\r\nto the Irish mission in Europe a singular and lofty character. In the\r\nbroad humanity that was the great distinction of their people\r\npersecution had no part. No war of religion stained their faith, and\r\nno barbarities to man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSCANDINAVIANS IN IRELAND\r\n\r\n800-1014\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a thousand years no foreign host had settled in Erin. But the times\r\nof peace were ended. About 800 A.D. the Irish suffered their first\r\ninvasion.\r\n\r\nThe Teutonic peoples, triumphant conquerors of the land, had carried\r\ntheir victories over the Roman Empire to the edge of the seas that\r\nguarded Ireland. But fresh hordes of warriors were gathering in the\r\nnorth, conquerors of the ocean. The Scandinavians had sailed out on\r\n\"the gulf's enormous abyss, where before their eyes the vanishing\r\nbounds of the earth were hidden in gloom.\" An old English riddle\r\nlikened the shattering iceberg swinging down from Arctic waters to the\r\nterror of the pirate's war-ship--the leader on the prow as it plunged\r\nthrough the sea, calling to the land, shouting as he goes, with\r\nlaughter terrible to the earth, swinging his sharp-edged sword, grim\r\nin hate, eager for slaughter, bitter in the battle-work. They came,\r\n\"great scourers of the seas--a nation desperate in attempting the\r\nconquest of other realms.\"\r\n\r\nThe Scandinavian campaigns of the ocean affected Ireland as no\r\ncontinental wars for the creation or the destruction of the Roman\r\nEmpire had done. During two hundred years their national life, their\r\nlearning, their civilisation, were threatened by strangers. The social\r\norder they had built up was confronted with two new tests--violence\r\nfrom without, and an alien population within the island. We may ask\r\nhow Irish civilisation met the trial.\r\n\r\nThe Danes fell on all the shores of England from the Forth to the\r\nChannel, the land of the Picts northward, Iona and the country of the\r\nScots to the west, and Bretland of the Britons from the Clyde to the\r\nLand's End: in Ireland they sailed up every creek, and shouldering\r\ntheir boats marched from river to river and lake to lake into every\r\ntribeland, covering the country with their forts, plundering the rich\r\nmen's raths of their cups and vessels and ornaments of gold, sacking\r\nthe schools and monasteries and churches, and entering every great\r\nking's grave for buried treasure. Their heavy iron swords, their\r\narmour, their discipline of war, gave them an overwhelming advantage\r\nagainst the Irish with, as they said, bodies and necks and gentle\r\nheads defended only by fine linen. Monks and scholars gathered up\r\ntheir manuscripts and holy ornaments, and fled away for refuge to\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThese wars brought a very different fate to the English and the Irish.\r\nIn England, when the Danes had planted a colony on every inlet of the\r\nsea (_c._ 800), they took horse and rode conquering over the inland\r\nplains. They slew every English king and wiped out every English royal\r\nhouse save that of Wessex; and in their place set up their own kings\r\nin Northumbria and East Anglia, and made of all middle England a vast\r\n\"Danelaw\" a land ruled by Danish law, and by confederations of Danish\r\ntowns. At the last Wessex itself was conquered, and a Danish king\r\nruled over all England (1013). In Ireland, on the other hand, the\r\ninvincible power of the tribal system for defence barred the way of\r\ninvaders. Every foot of land was defended; every tribe fought for its\r\nown soil. There could be no subjection of the Irish clans except by\r\ntheir extermination. A Norwegian leader, Thorgils, made one supreme\r\neffort at conquest. He fixed his capital at Armagh and set up at its\r\nshrine the worship of Thor, while his wife gave her oracles from the\r\nhigh altar of Clonmacnois on the Shannon, in the prophetess's cloak\r\nset with stones to the hem, the necklace of glass beads, the staff,\r\nand the great skin pouch of charms. But in the end Thorgils was taken\r\nby the king of Meath and executed, being cast into Loch Nair. The\r\nDanes, who held long and secure possession of England, great part of\r\nScotland, and Normandy, were never able to occupy permanently any part\r\nof Ireland more than a day's march from the chief stations of their\r\nfleets. Through two hundred years of war no Irish royal house was\r\ndestroyed, no kingdom was extinguished, and no national supremacy of\r\nthe Danes replaced the national supremacy of the Irish.\r\n\r\nThe long war was one of \"confused noise and garments rolled in\r\nblood.\" Ireland, whether they could conquer it or not, was of vast\r\nimportance to the Scandinavians as a land of refuge for their fleets.\r\nVoyagers guided their way by the flights of birds from her shores; the\r\nharbours of \"the great island\" sheltered them; her fields of corn, her\r\ncattle driven to the shore for the \"strand-hewing,\" provisioned their\r\ncrews; her woods gave timber for shipbuilding. Norwegians and Danes\r\nfought furiously for possession of the sea-ports, now against the\r\nIrish, now against each other. No victory or defeat counted beyond the\r\nday among the shifting and multiplying fleets of new marauders that\r\nfor ever swarmed round the coasts--emigrants who had flung themselves\r\non the sea for freedom's sake to save their old laws and liberties,\r\nbuccaneers seeking \"the spoils of the sea,\" sea-kings roaming the\r\nocean or gathering for a raid on Scotland or on France, stray\r\ncompanies out of work or putting in for a winter's shelter, boats of\r\nwhale-fishers and walrus-killers, Danish hosts driven out of England\r\nor of Normandy. As \"the sea vomited up floods of foreigners into Erin\r\nso that there was not a point without a fleet,\" battle swung\r\nbackwards and forwards between old settlers and new pirates, between\r\nNorsemen and Danes, between both and the Irish.\r\n\r\nBut the Scandinavians were not only sea-rovers, they were the greatest\r\nmerchants that northern Europe had yet seen. From the time of Charles\r\nthe Great to William the Conqueror, the whole commerce of the seas was\r\nin their hands. Eastward they pushed across Russia to the Black Sea,\r\nand carried back the wares of Asia to the Baltic; westward they poured\r\nalong the coasts of Gaul by the narrow seas, or sailed the Atlantic\r\nfrom the Orkneys and Hebrides round the Irish coast to the Bay of\r\nBiscay. The new-made empire of Charles the Great was opening Europe\r\nonce more to a settled life and the possibilities of traffic, and the\r\nDanish merchants seized the beginnings of the new trade. Ireland lay\r\nin the very centre of their seaways, with its harbours, its wealth,\r\nand its traditional commerce with France. Merchants made settlements\r\nalong the coasts, and planted colonies over the inland country to\r\nsupply the trade of the ports. They had come to Ireland for business,\r\nand they wanted peace and not war. They intermarried with the Irish,\r\nfostered their children, brought their goods, welcomed Irish poets\r\ninto their forts, listening to Irish stories and taking new models for\r\ntheir own literature, and in war they joined with their Irish\r\nneighbours. A race of \"Gall-Gaels,\" or \"foreign Irish,\" grew up,\r\naccepted by the Irish as of their community. Between the two peoples\r\nthere was respect and good-will.\r\n\r\nThe enterprise of the sea-rovers and the merchant settlers created on\r\nIrish shores two Scandinavian \"kingdoms\"--kingdoms rather of the sea\r\nthan of the land. The Norsemen set up their moot on the Mound over the\r\nriver Liffey (near where the Irish Parliament House rose in later\r\ndays), and there created a naval power which reached along the coast\r\nfrom Waterford to Dundalk. The Dublin kingdom was closely connected\r\nwith the Danish kingdom of Northumbria, which had its capital at York,\r\nand formed the common meeting-ground, the link which united the\r\nNorthmen of Scandinavia and the Northmen of Ireland. A mighty\r\nconfederation grew up. Members of the same house were kings in Dublin,\r\nin Man, and in York. The Irish Channel swarmed with their fleets. The\r\nsea was the common highway which linked the powers together, and the\r\nsea was held by fleets of swift long-ships with from ninety to a\r\nhundred and fifty rowers or fighting men on board. Dublin, the\r\nrallying-point of roving marauders, became the centre of a wide-flung\r\nwar. Its harbour, looking east, was the mart of the merchant princes\r\nof the Baltic trade: there men of Iceland and of Norway landed with\r\ntheir merchandise or their plunder.\r\n\r\n\"Limerick of the swift ships,\" \"Limerick of the riveted stones,\" the\r\nkingdom lying on the Atlantic was a rival even to Dublin; kings of the\r\nsame house ruled in Limerick and the Hebrides, and their fleets took\r\nthe way of the wide ocean; while Norse settlements scattered over\r\nLimerick, Kerry and Tipperary, organised as Irish clans and giving an\r\nIrish form to their names, maintained the inland trade. Other Munster\r\nharbours were held, some by the Danes, some by the Irish.\r\n\r\nThe Irish were on good terms with the traders. They learned to build\r\nthe new ships invented by the Scandinavians where both oars and sails\r\nwere used, and traded in their own ports for treasures from oversea,\r\nsilken raiment and abundance of wine. We read in 900 of Irishmen along\r\nthe Cork shores \"high in beauty, whose resolve is quiet prosperity,\"\r\nand in 950 of \"Munster of the great riches,\" \"Munster of the swift\r\nships.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Irish never ceased from war with the sea-kings.\r\nFrom the time of Thorgils, high-kings of Tara one after another led\r\nthe perpetual contest to hold Ireland and to possess Dublin. They\r\nsummoned assemblies in north and south of the confederated chiefs. The\r\nIrish copied not only the Scandinavian building of war-ships, but\r\ntheir method of raising a navy by dividing the coast into districts,\r\neach of which had to equip and man ten ships, to assemble at the\r\nsummons for the united war-fleet. Every province seems to have had its\r\nfleet. The Irish, in fact, learned their lesson so well that they were\r\nable to undertake the re-conquest of their country, and become leaders\r\nof Danish and Norse troops in war. The spirit of the people rose\r\nhigh. From 900 their victories increased even amid disaster. Strong\r\nkings arose among them, good organisers and good fighters, and for a\r\nhundred years one leader followed hard on another. In 916, Niall, king\r\nof Tara, celebrated once more the assembly of Telltown, and led\r\nsouthern and northern O'Neills to the aid of Munster against the\r\nGentiles, directing the men of Leinster in the campaign--a gallant\r\nwar. Murtagh, king of Ailech or Tirconnell, smote the Danes at\r\nCarlingford and Louth in 926, a year of great danger, and so came\r\nvictorious to the assembly at Telltown. Again, in 933, he defeated the\r\n\"foreigners\" in the north, and they left two hundred and forty heads,\r\nand all their wealth of spoils. In 941 he won his famous name,\r\n\"Murtagh of the Leather Cloaks,\" from the first midwinter campaign\r\never known in Ireland, \"the hosting of the frost,\" when he led his\r\narmy from Donegal, under shelter of leather cloaks, over lakes and\r\nrivers frozen by the mighty frost, round the entire circuit of\r\nIreland. Some ten years later, Cellachan, king of Cashel, took up the\r\nfight; with his linen-coated soldiers against the mail-clad\r\nforeigners, he swept the whole of Munster, capturing Limerick, Cork,\r\nCashel and Waterford, and joining their Danish armies to his own\r\ntroops; till he closed his campaign by calling out the Munster fleet\r\nfrom Kinsale to Galway bay, six or seven score of them, to meet the\r\nDanish ships at Dundalk. The Norsemen used armour, and rough chains of\r\nblue iron to grapple the enemies' ships, but the Irish sailors, with\r\ntheir \"strong enclosures of linen cloth,\" and tough ropes of hemp to\r\nfling over the enemies' prows, came off victorious. According to the\r\nsaga of his triumph, Cellachan called the whole of Ireland to share in\r\nthe struggle for Irish freedom, and a fleet from Ailech carried off\r\nplunder and booty from the Hebrides. He was followed by Brian Boru.\r\n\"Ill luck was it for the Danes when Brian was born,\" says the old\r\nsaga, \"when he inflicted not evil on the foreigners in the day time he\r\ndid it in the next night.\" From beyond the Shannon he led a fierce\r\nguerrilla war. Left with but fifteen followers alive, sleeping on\r\n\"hard knotty wet roots,\" he still refused to yield. \"It is not\r\nhereditary to us,\" he said, \"to submit.\" He became king of Munster in\r\n974, drove out the Danish king from Dublin in 998, and ruled at last\r\nin 1000 as Ardri of Ireland, an old man of sixty or seventy years. In\r\n1005 he called out all the fleets of the Norsemen of Dublin,\r\nWaterford, Wexford, and of the men of Munster, and of almost all of\r\nthe men of Erin, such of them as were fit to go to sea, and they\r\nlevied tribute from Saxons and Britons as far as the Clyde and Argyle.\r\n\r\nA greater struggle still lay before the Irish. Powerful kings of\r\nDenmark, in the glory of success, began to think of their imperial\r\ndestiny; and, to round off their states, proposed to create a\r\nScandinavian empire from the Slavic shores of the Baltic across\r\nDenmark, Norway, England and Ireland, to the rim of the Atlantic, with\r\nLondon as the capital. King Sweyn Forkbeard, conqueror of all England,\r\nwas acknowledged in 1018 its king. But the imperial plan was not yet\r\ncomplete. A free Irish nation of men who lived, as they said, \"on the\r\nridge of the world\"--a land of unconquered peoples of the open plains\r\nand the mountains and the sea, left the Scandinavian empire with a\r\nragged edge out on the line of the Atlantic commerce. King Cnut sent\r\nout his men for the last conquest. A vast host gathered in Dublin bay\r\n\"from all the west of Europe,\" from Norway, the Baltic islands, the\r\nOrkneys, Iceland, for the landing at Clontarf. From sunrise to sunset\r\nthe battle raged, the hair of the warriors flying in the wind as thick\r\nas the sheaves floating in a field of oats. The Scandinavian scheme of\r\na northern empire was shattered on that day, when with the evening\r\nfloodtide the remnant of the broken Danish host put to sea. Brian\r\nBoru, his son, and his grandson lay dead. But for a hundred and fifty\r\nyears to come Ireland kept its independence. England was once again,\r\nas in the time of the Roman dominion, made part of a continental\r\nempire. Ireland, as in the days of Rome, still lay outside the new\r\nimperial system.\r\n\r\nAt the end, therefore, of two hundred years of war, the Irish emerged\r\nwith their national life unbroken. Irish kingdoms had lived on side by\r\nside with Danish kingdoms; in spite of the strength of the Danish\r\nforces, the constant irruptions of new Danes, and the business\r\ncapacity of these fighters and traffickers, it was the Irish who were\r\nsteadily coming again to the top. Through all perils they had kept\r\ntheir old order. The high-kings had ruled without a break, and, except\r\nin a few years of special calamity, had held the national assemblies\r\nof the country at Telltown, not far from Tara. The tribesmen of the\r\nsub-kingdoms, if their ancient place of assembly had been turned into\r\na Danish fort, held their meeting in a hidden marsh or wood. Thus when\r\nCashel was held by the Norsemen, the assembly met on a mound that rose\r\nin the marshy glen now called Glanworth. There Cellachan, the rightful\r\nheir, in the best of arms and dress, demanded that the nobles should\r\nremember justice, while his mother declared his title and recited a\r\npoem. And when the champions of Munster heard these great words and\r\nthe speech of the woman, the tribes arose right readily to make\r\nCellachan king. They set up his shout of king, and gave thanks to the\r\ntrue magnificent God for having found him. The nobles then came to\r\nCellachan and put their hands in his hand, and placed the royal\r\ndiadem round his head, and their spirits were raised at the grand\r\nsight of him.\r\n\r\nThroughout the wars, too, the tribes had not lost the tradition of\r\nlearning. King AElfred has recorded the state of England after the\r\nDanish wars; he could not bethink him of a single one south of the\r\nThames who could understand his ritual in English, or translate aught\r\nout of Latin, and he could hear of very few north of the Thames to the\r\nHumber, and beyond the Humber scarce any, \"so clean was learning\r\ndecayed among the English folk.\" But the Irish had never ceased to\r\ncarry on schools, and train men of distinguished learning. Clonmacnois\r\non the Shannon, for example, preserved a truly Irish culture, and\r\nbetween its sackings trained great scholars whose fame could reach to\r\nKing AElfred in Wessex, and to Charles the Great in Aachen. The Irish\r\nclergy still remained unequalled in culture, even in Italy. One of\r\nthem in 868 was the most learned of the Latinists of all Europe.\r\nAnother, Cormac, king and bishop (+905), was skilled in Old-Irish\r\nliterature, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Welsh, Anglo-Saxon and Norse--he\r\nmight be compared with that other great Irishman of his time, John\r\nScotus, whom Charles the Bald had made head of his school. Irish\r\nteachers had a higher skill than any others in Europe in astronomy,\r\ngeography and philosophy. Side by side with monastic schools the lay\r\nschools had continued without a break. By 900 the lawyers had produced\r\nat least eighteen law-books whose names are known, and a glossary. A\r\nlay scholar, probably of the ninth century, compiled the instructions\r\nof a king to his son--\"Learning every art, knowledge of every\r\nlanguage, skill in variegated work, pleading with established\r\nmaxims\"--these are the sciences he recommends. The Triads, compiled\r\nabout the same time, count among the ornaments of wisdom, \"abundance\r\nof knowledge, a number of precedents.\" Irish poets, men and women,\r\nwere the first in Europe to sing of Nature--of summer and winter, of\r\nthe cuckoo with the grey mantle, the blackbird's lay, the red bracken\r\nand the long hair of the heather, the talk of the rushes, the\r\ngreen-barked yew-tree which supports the sky, the large green of an\r\noak fronting the storm. They sang of the Creation and the Crucifixion,\r\nwhen \"dear God's elements were afraid\"; and of pilgrimage to\r\nRome--\"the King whom thou seekest here, unless thou bring Him with\r\nthee thou dost not find\"; of the hermit's \"shining candles above the\r\npure white scriptures ... and I to be sitting for a while praying God\r\nin every place\"; of the great fidelities of love--\"the flagstone upon\r\nwhich he was wont to pray, she was upon it until she died. Her soul\r\nwent to heaven. And that flagstone was put over her face.\" They\r\nchanted the terror of the time, the fierce riders of the sea in\r\ndeath-conflict with the mounting waves: \"Bitter is the conflict with\r\nthe tremendous tempest\"--\"Bitter is the wind to-night. It tosses the\r\nocean's white hair; I do not fear the fierce warriors of Norway\r\ncoursing on the Irish sea to-night.\" And in their own war of\r\ndeliverance they sang of Finn and his Fiana on the battlefield, heroes\r\nof the Irish race.\r\n\r\nEven the craftsmen's schools were still gathered in their raths,\r\npreserving from century to century the forms and rules of their art;\r\nsoon after the battle of Clontarf we read of \"the chief artificer of\r\nIreland.\" The perfection of their art in enamel and gold work has been\r\nthe wonder of the old and of the modern world. Many influences had\r\ncome in--Oriental, Byzantine, Scandinavian, French--and the Irish took\r\nand used them all, but their art still remained Gaelic, of their\r\nnative soil. No jeweller's work was ever more perfect than the Ardagh\r\nchalice of the ninth or tenth century, of pure Celtic art with no\r\ntrace of Danish influence. The metal-workers of Munster must have been\r\nfamous, from the title of \"king Cellachan of the lovely cups\"; and the\r\ngolden case that enclosed the Gospel of Columcille in 1000 was for its\r\nsplendour \"the chief relic from the western world.\" The stone-workers,\r\ntoo, carried on their art. There were schools of carvers eminent for\r\nskill, such as that of Holy Island on Lough Derg. One of the churches\r\nof Clonmacnois may date from the ninth century, five others from the\r\ntenth; finely sculptured gravestones commemorated saints and scholars;\r\nand the high-cross, a monolith ten feet high set up as a memorial to\r\nking Flann about 914, was carved by an Irish artist who was one of the\r\ngreatest sculptors of northern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe temper of the people was shown in their hero-king Brian Boru,\r\nwarrior and scholar. His government was with patience, mercy and\r\njustice. \"King Brian thrice forgave all his outlaws the same fault,\"\r\nsays a Scandinavian saga, \"but if they misbehaved themselves oftener,\r\nthen he let them be judged by the law; and from this one may mark what\r\na king he must have been.\" \"He sent professors and masters to teach\r\nwisdom and knowledge, and to buy books beyond the sea and the great\r\nocean, because the writings and books in every church and sanctuary\r\nhad been destroyed by the plunderers; and Brian himself gave the price\r\nof learning and the price of books to every one separately who went on\r\nthis service. Many churches were built and repaired by him, bridges\r\nand roads were made, the fortresses of Munster were strengthened.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the astonishing vitality of learning and art among the Irish.\r\nBy their social system the intellectual treasures of the race had\r\nbeen distributed among the whole people, and committed to their care.\r\nAnd the Irish tribes had proved worthy guardians of the national\r\nfaith. They had known how to profit by the material skill and\r\nknowledge of the Danes. Irishmen were willing to absorb the\r\nforeigners, to marry with them, and even at times to share their wars.\r\nThey learned from them to build ships, organise naval forces, advance\r\nin trade, and live in towns; they used the northern words for the\r\nparts of a ship, and the streets of a town. In outward and material\r\ncivilisation they accepted the latest Scandinavian methods, just as in\r\nour days the Japanese accepted the latest Western inventions. But in\r\nwhat the Germans call culture--in the ordering of society and law, of\r\nlife and thought, the Irish never abandoned their national loyalty.\r\nDuring two centuries of Danish invasions and occupations the Gaelic\r\ncivilisation had not given way an inch to the strangers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST IRISH REVIVAL\r\n\r\n1014-1169\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Clontarf in 1014 the Irish had a hundred and fifty\r\nyears of comparative quiet. \"A lively, stirring, ancient and\r\nvictorious people,\" they turned to repair their hurts and to build up\r\ntheir national life.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Danish wars there had been a growth of industry and\r\nriches. No people ever made a successful national rally unless they\r\nwere on the rising wave of prosperity. It is not misery and\r\ndegradation that bring success. Already Ireland was known in France as\r\n\"that very wealthy country in which there were twelve cities, and wide\r\nbishoprics, and a king, and that had its own language, and Latin\r\nletters.\"\r\n\r\nBut the position of the Gaels was no longer what it had been before\r\nthe invasions. The \"Foreigners\" called constantly for armed help from\r\ntheir people without, and by political alliances and combinations\r\nfostered war among the Irish states themselves. Nearly a hundred years\r\nafter Clontarf king Magnus of Norway (1103) led the greatest army that\r\never marched conquering over Ireland. In a dark fen the young giant\r\nflamed out a mark for all, with his shining helmet, his golden hair\r\nfalling long over his red silken coat, his red shield, and laid\r\nthereon a golden lion. There he fell by an Irish axe. The glory and\r\nterror of \"Magnus of the swift ships,\" \"Magnus of the terrible\r\nbattles,\" was sung in Ireland for half-a-dozen centuries after that\r\nlast flaring-up of ancient fires.\r\n\r\nThe national life, moreover, was now threatened by the settlement of\r\nan alien race, strangers to the Irish tradition, strangers to the\r\nIrish idea of a state, and to their feeling of a church. The sea-kings\r\nhad created in Dublin an open gateway into Ireland, a gateway like\r\nQuebec in Canada, that commanded the country and that the country\r\ncould never again close from within. They had filled the city with\r\nScandinavian settlers from the English and Welsh coasts--pioneers of\r\nEnglish invasion. A wealthy and compact community living on the\r\nseaboard, trading with all Europe, inclined to the views of their\r\nbusiness clients in England and the Empire, their influence doubled\r\nthe strength of the European pressure on Ireland as against the Gaelic\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\nTo the division of peoples within the Irish state the Danes added also\r\nthe first division in the Irish church. Olaf Cuaran, overlord of\r\nnorthmen of Dublin and York, had been baptized (943) in Northumberland\r\nby the archbishop of Canterbury, in presence of the English king. He\r\nformed the first converted Danes into a part of the English Church, so\r\nthat their bishops were sent to be ordained at Canterbury. Since the\r\nIrish in 603 had refused to deal with an archbishop of the English,\r\nthis was the first foothold Canterbury had got in Ireland. It was the\r\nrending in two of the Irish tradition, the degrading of the primacy of\r\nArmagh, the admission of a foreign power, and the triumph of the\r\nEnglish over the Gaelic church.\r\n\r\nIn church and state, therefore, the Danes had brought the first\r\nanti-national element into Irish life. The change is marked by a\r\nchange of name. The Danes coined the name \"_Ire_-land,\" a form of Eriu\r\nsuited to their own speech; the people they called \"Irish,\" leaving\r\nthe name of \"Scots\" only to the Gaels who had crossed the sea into\r\nAlban. Their trading ships carried the words far and wide, and the old\r\nname of Erin only remained in the speech of the Gaels themselves.\r\n\r\nClontarf, too, had marked ominously the passing of an old age, the\r\nbeginning of a new. Already the peoples round the North Sea--Normans,\r\nGermans, English--were sending out traders to take the place of the\r\nScandinavians; and the peoples of the south--Italians and Gauls--were\r\nresuming their ancient commerce. We may see the advent of the new men\r\nin the names of adventurers that landed with the Danes on that low\r\nshore at Clontarf--the first great drops of the storm--lords from\r\nNormandy, a Frenchman from Gaul, and somewhere about that time Walter\r\nthe Englishman, a leader of mercenaries from England. In such names we\r\nsee the heralds of the coming change.\r\n\r\nThe Irish were therefore face to face with questions of a new\r\norder--how to fuse two wholly different peoples into one community;\r\nhow to make a united church within a united nation; and how to use\r\nforeign influences pouring in on all sides so as to enrich without\r\ndestroying the national life. Here was the work of the next hundred\r\nand fifty years. Such problems have been solved in other lands by\r\npowerful kings at the heads of armies; in Ireland it was the work of\r\nthe whole community of tribes. It is in this effort that we see the\r\nimmense vitality of the Gaelic system the power of its tradition, and\r\nthe spirit of its people.\r\n\r\nAfter Brian's death two learned men were set over the government of\r\nIreland; a layman, the Chief Poet, and a devout man, the Anchorite of\r\nall Ireland. \"The land was governed like a free state and not like a\r\nmonarchy by them.\" The victory of Clontarf was celebrated by a\r\nrenascence of learning. Eye-witnesses of that great battle, poets and\r\nhistorians, wrote the chronicle of the Danish wars from first to last,\r\nand sang the glories of Cellachan and of Brian Boru in the greatness\r\nof his life and the majesty of his death. A scholar put into Irish\r\nfrom Latin the \"Tale of Troy,\" where the exploits and battle rage of\r\nthe ancient heroes matched the martial ardour of Irish champions, and\r\nthe same words are used for the fights and armour and ships of the\r\nTrojan as of the Danish wars. Another translated from Latin a history\r\nof the Britons, the neighbouring Celtic races across the Channel. In\r\nschools three or four hundred poetic metres were taught. The glories\r\nof ancient Erin were revived. Poets wrote of Usnech, of Tara, of\r\nAilech, of the O'Neills on Lough Swilly in the far north, of Brian\r\nBoru's palace Kincora on the Shannon, of Rath Cruachan of Connacht.\r\nTales of heroes, triumphs of ancient kings, were written in the form\r\nin which we now know them, genealogies of the tribes and old hymns of\r\nIrish saints. Clerics and laymen rivalled one another in zeal. In\r\nkings' courts, in monasteries, in schools, annals of Ireland from the\r\nearliest to the latest time were composed. Men laboured to satisfy the\r\ndesire of the Irish to possess a complete and brilliant picture of\r\nIreland from all antiquity. The most famous among the many writers,\r\none of the most learned men in all Europe in wisdom, literature,\r\nhistory, poetry, and science, was Flann the layman, teacher of the\r\nschool of Monasterboice, who died in 1056--\"slow the bright eyes of\r\nhis fine head,\" ran the old song. He made for his pupils synchronisms\r\nof the kings of Asia and of Roman emperors with Irish kings, and of\r\nthe Irish high-kings and provincial chiefs and kings of Scotland.\r\nWritings of that time which have escaped destruction, such as the\r\n_Book of Leinster_, remain the most important relics of Celtic\r\nliterature in the world.\r\n\r\nThere was already the beginning of a university in the ancient school\r\nof Armagh lying on the famous hill where for long ages the royal tombs\r\nof the O'Neills had been preserved. \"The strong burh of Tara has\r\ndied,\" they said, \"while Armagh lives filled with learned champions.\"\r\nIt now rose to a great position. With its three thousand scholars,\r\nfamous for its teachers, under its high-ollave Gorman who spent\r\ntwenty-one years of study, from 1133 to 1154, in England and France,\r\nit became in fact the national university for the Irish race in\r\nIreland and Scotland. It was appointed that every lector in any church\r\nin Ireland must take there a degree; and in 1169 the high-king\r\nRuaidhri O'Conor gave the first annual grant to maintain a professor\r\nat Armagh \"for all the Irish and the Scots.\"\r\n\r\nA succession of great bishops of Armagh laboured to bring about also\r\nthe organisation of a national church under the government of Armagh.\r\nFrom 1068 they began to make visitations of the whole country, and\r\ntake tribute and offerings in sign of the Armagh leadership. They\r\njourneyed in the old Irish fashion on foot, one of them followed by a\r\ncow on whose milk he lived, all poor, without servants, without money,\r\nwandering among hills and remote hamlets, stopping men on the roadside\r\nto talk, praying for them all night by the force only of their piety\r\nand the fervour of their spirit drawing all the communities under\r\nobedience to the see of Patrick, the national saint. In a series of\r\nsynods from 1100 to 1157 a fixed number of bishops' sees was marked\r\nout, and four archbishoprics representing the four provinces. The\r\nDanish sees, moreover, were brought into this union, and made part of\r\nthe Irish organisation. Thus the power of Canterbury in Ireland was\r\nended, and a national church set up of Irish and Danes. Dublin, the\r\nold Scandinavian kingdom, whose prelates for over a hundred years had\r\nbeen consecrated in England (1036-1161), was the last to hold out\r\nagainst the union of churches, till this strife was healed by St.\r\nLorcan ua Tuathail, the first Irish bishop consecrated in Dublin. He\r\ncarried to that battleground of the peoples all the charity, piety,\r\nand asceticism of the Irish saint: feeding the poor daily, never\r\nhimself tasting meat, rising at midnight to pray till dawn, and ever\r\nbefore he slept going out into the graveyard to pray there for the\r\ndead; from time to time withdrawing among the Wicklow hills to St.\r\nKevin's Cave at Glendalough, a hole in the cliff overhanging the dark\r\nlake swept with storm from the mountain-pass, where twice a week bread\r\nand water were brought him by a boat and a ladder up the rock. His\r\nlife was spent in the effort for national peace and union, nor had\r\nIreland a truer patriot or wiser statesman.\r\n\r\nKings and chiefs sat with the clergy in the Irish synods, and in the\r\nstate too there were signs of a true union of the peoples. The Danes,\r\ngradually absorbed into the Irish population, lost the sense of\r\nseparate nationality. The growing union of the peoples was seen in the\r\nincreasing power of the Ardri. Brian's line maintained at Cachel the\r\ntitle of \"kings of Ireland,\" strengthening their house with Danish\r\nmarriages; they led Danish forces and were elected kings of the Danes\r\nin Dublin. But in the twelfth century it was the Connacht kings who\r\ncame to the front, the same race that a thousand years before had\r\nspread their power across the Shannon to Usnech and to Tara. Turlough\r\nO'Conor (1118-1156) was known to Henry I of England as \"king of\r\nIreland\"; on a metal cross made for him he is styled \"king of Erin,\"\r\nand a missal of his time (1150) contains the only prayer yet known for\r\n\"the king of the Irish and his army\"--the sign, as we may see, of\r\nforeign influences on the Irish mind. His son, Ruaidhri or Rory, was\r\nproclaimed (1166) Ardri in Dublin with greater pomp than any king\r\nbefore him, and held at Athboy in Meath an assembly of the \"men of\r\nIreland,\" archbishops and clergy, princes and nobles, eighteen\r\nthousand horsemen from the tribes and provinces, and a thousand Danes\r\nfrom Dublin--there laws were made for the honour of churches and\r\nclergy, the restoring of prey unjustly taken, and the control of\r\ntribes and territories, so that a woman might traverse the land in\r\nsafety; and the vast gathering broke up \"in peace and amity, without\r\nbattle or controversy, or any one complaining of another at that\r\nmeeting.\" It is said that Rory O'Conor's procession when he held the\r\nlast of the national festivals at Telltown was several miles in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThe whole of Ireland is covered with the traces of this great national\r\nrevival. We may still see on islands, along river-valleys, in lonely\r\nfields, innumerable ruins of churches built of stone chiselled as\r\nfinely as man's hand can cut it; and of the lofty round towers and\r\nsculptured high crosses that were multiplied over the land after the\r\nday of Clontarf. The number of the churches has not been counted. It\r\nmust be astonishing. At first they were built in the \"Romanesque\" style\r\nbrought from the continent, with plain round arches, as Brian Boru made\r\nthem about A.D. 1000; presently chancels were added, and doors and\r\nwindows and arches richly carved. These churches were still small,\r\nintimate, suited to the worship of the tribal communities; as time went\r\non they were larger and more richly decorated, but always marked with\r\nthe remembrance of Irish tradition and ornament, and signed by Irish\r\nmasons on the stones. There was a wealth of metal work of great\r\nsplendour, decorated with freedom and boldness of design, with inlaid\r\nwork and filigree, and settings of stones and enamels and crystal; as\r\nwe may see in book-shrines, in the crosiers of Lismore and Cachel and\r\nClonmacnois and many others, in the matchless processional cross of\r\nCong, in the great shrine of St. Manchan with twenty-four figures\r\nhighly raised on each side in a variety of postures remarkable for the\r\ntime. It was covered with an embroidery of gold in as good style, say\r\nthe Annals, as a reliquary was ever covered in Ireland. Irish skill was\r\nknown abroad. A French hero of romance wore a fine belt of Irish\r\nleather-work, and a knight of Bavaria had from Ireland ribbon of\r\ngold-lace embroidered with animals in red gold.\r\n\r\nThe vigour of Irish life overflowed, indeed, the bounds of the\r\ncountry. Cloth from Ireland was already sold in England and it was\r\nsoon to spread over all Europe. It is probable that export of corn and\r\nprovisions had already begun, and of timber, besides hides and wool.\r\nAnd the frequent mention of costly gifts and tributes, and of\r\nsurprisingly large sums of gold and silver show a country of steadily\r\nexpanding wealth. From the time of Brian Boru learned men poured over\r\nthe continent. Pilgrims journeyed to Compostella, to Rome, or through\r\nGreece to Jordan and Jerusalem--composing poems on the way, making\r\ndiscourses in Latin, showing their fine art of writing. John, bishop\r\nof Mecklenburg, preached to the Vandals between the Elbe and the\r\nVistula; Marianus \"the Scot\" on his pilgrimage to Rome stopped at\r\nRegensburg on the Danube, and founded there a monastery of north\r\nIrishmen in 1068, to which was soon added a second house for south\r\nIrishmen. Out of these grew the twelve Irish convents of Germany and\r\nAustria. An Irish abbot was head of a monastery in Bulgaria. From time\r\nto time the Irish came home to collect money for their foundations\r\nand went back laden with gold from the kings at home. Pope Adrian IV\r\n(1154) remembered with esteem the Irish professor under whom he had\r\nstudied in Paris University. Irishmen were chaplains of the emperor\r\nConrad III (+1152) and of his successor Frederick Barbarossa.\r\nStrangers \"moved by the love of study\" still set out \"in imitation of\r\ntheir ancestors to visit the land of the Irish so wonderfully\r\ncelebrated for its learning.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the spirit of Ireland manifested itself in the shaping of a\r\nnational university, and of a national church, in the revival of the\r\nglories of the Ardri, and in vigour of art and learning, there was an\r\noutburst too among the common folk of jubilant patriotism. We can hear\r\nthe passionate voice of the people in the songs and legends, the\r\nprophecies of the enduring life of Irishmen on Irish land, the popular\r\ntales that began at this time to run from mouth to mouth. They took to\r\nthemselves two heroes to be centres of the national hope--Finn the\r\nchampion, leader of the \"Fiana,\" the war-bands of old time; and\r\nPatrick the saint. A multitude of tales suddenly sprang up of the\r\nadventures of Finn--the warrior worthy of a king, the son of wisdom,\r\nthe mighty hunter of every mountain and forest in Ireland, whose death\r\nno minstrel cared to sing. Every poet was expected to recite the fame\r\nin life of Finn and his companions. Pedigrees were invented to link\r\nhim with every great house in Ireland, for their greater glory and\r\nauthority. Side by side with Finn the people set St. Patrick--keeper\r\nof Ireland against all strangers, guardian of their nation and\r\ntradition. It was Patrick, they told, who by invincible prayer and\r\nfasting at last compelled Heaven to grant that outlanders should not\r\nfor ever inhabit Erin; \"that the Saxons should not dwell in Ireland,\r\nby consent or perforce, so long as I abide in heaven:\" \"Thou shalt\r\nhave this,\" said the outwearied angel. \"Around thee,\" was the\r\ntriumphant Irish hope, \"on the Day of Judgment the men of Erin shall\r\ncome to judgment\"; for after the twelve thrones of the apostles were\r\nset in Judaea to judge the tribes of Israel, Patrick himself should at\r\nthe end arise and call the people of Ireland to be judged by him on a\r\nmountain in their own land.\r\n\r\nAs in the old Gaelic tradition, so now the people fused in a single\r\nemotion the nation and the church. They brought from dusky woods the\r\nlast gaunt relics of Finn's company, sad and dispirited at the falling\r\nof the evening clouds, and set them face to face with Patrick as he\r\nchanted mass on one of their old raths--men twice as tall as the\r\nmodern folk, with their huge wolf-dogs, men \"who were not of our epoch\r\nor of one time with the clergy.\" When Patrick hesitated to hear their\r\npagan memories of Ireland and its graves, of its men who died for\r\nhonour, of its war and hunting, its silver bridles and cups of yellow\r\ngold, its music and great feastings, lest such recreation of spirit\r\nand mind should be to him a destruction of devotion and dereliction of\r\nprayer, angels were sent to direct him to give ear to the ancient\r\nstories of Ireland, and write them down for the joy of companies and\r\nnobles of the latter time. \"Victory and blessing wait on thee,\r\nCaeilte,\" said Patrick, thus called to the national service; \"for the\r\nfuture thy stories and thyself are dear to me\"; \"grand lore and\r\nknowledge is this thou hast uttered to us.\" \"Thou too, Patrick, hast\r\ntaught us good things,\" the warriors responded with courteous\r\ndignity. So at all the holy places of Ireland, the pillar-stone of\r\nancient Usnech, the ruined mounds of Tara, great Rath-Cruachan of\r\nConnacht, the graves of mighty champions, Pagan hero and Christian\r\nsaint sat together to make interchange of history and religion, the\r\nteaching of the past and the promise of the future. St. Patrick gave\r\nhis blessing to minstrels and story-tellers and to all craftsmen of\r\nIreland--\"and to them that profess it be it all happiness.\" He mounted\r\nto the high glen to see the Fiana raise their warning signal of heroic\r\nchase and hunting. He saw the heavy tears of the last of the heroes\r\ntill his very breast, his chest was wet. He laid in his bosom the head\r\nof the pagan hunter and warrior: \"By me to thee,\" said Patrick, \"and\r\nwhatsoever be the place in which God shall lay hand on thee, Heaven is\r\nassigned.\" \"For thy sake,\" said the saint, \"be thy lord Finn mac\r\nCumhall taken out of torment, if it be good in the sight of God.\"\r\n\r\nIn no other country did such a fate befall a missionary coming from\r\nstrangers--to be taken and clothed upon with the national passion of\r\na people, shaped after the pattern of their spirit, made the keeper of\r\nthe nation's soul, the guardian of its whole tradition. Such legends\r\nshow how enthusiasm for the common country ran through every hamlet in\r\nthe land, and touched the poorest as it did the most learned. They\r\nshow that the social order in Ireland after the Danish settlements was\r\nthe triumph of an Irish and not a Danish civilisation. The national\r\nlife of the Irish, free, democratic, embracing every emotion of the\r\nwhole people, gentle or simple, was powerful enough to gather into it\r\nthe strong and freedom-loving rovers of the sea.\r\n\r\nOn all sides, therefore, we see the growth of a people compacted of\r\nIrish and Danes, bound together under the old Irish law and social\r\norder, with Dublin as a centre of the united races, Armagh a national\r\nuniversity, a single and independent church under an Irish primate of\r\nArmagh and an Irish archbishop of Dublin, a high-king calling the\r\npeople together in a succession of national assemblies for the common\r\ngood of the country. The new union of Ireland was being slowly worked\r\nout by her political councillors, her great ecclesiastics, her\r\nscholars and philosophers, and by the faith of the common people in\r\nthe glory of their national inheritance. \"The bodies and minds of the\r\npeople were endued with extraordinary abilities of nature,\" so that\r\nart, learning and commerce prospered in their hands. On this fair hope\r\nof rising civilisation there fell a new and tremendous trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE NORMAN INVASION\r\n\r\n1169-1520\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of the Danes the Normans, conquerors of England,\r\nentered on the dominion of the sea--\"citizens of the world,\" they\r\ncarried their arms and their cunning from the Tweed to the\r\nMediterranean, from the Seine to the Euphrates. The spirit of conquest\r\nwas in the air. Every landless man was looking to make his fortune.\r\nEvery baron desired, like his viking forefathers, a land where he\r\ncould live out of reach of the king's long arm. They had marked out\r\nIreland as their natural prey--\"a land very rich in plunder, and famed\r\nfor the good temperature of the air, the fruitfulness of the soil, the\r\npleasant and commodious seats for habitation, and safe and large ports\r\nand havens lying open for traffic.\" Norman barons were among the\r\nenemy at the battle of Clontarf in 1014. The same year that Ireland\r\nsaw the last of the Scandinavian sea kings (1103) she saw the first of\r\nthe Norman invaders prying out the country for a kingdom. William\r\nRufus (1087-1100) had fetched from Ireland great oaks to roof his Hall\r\nat Westminster, and planned the conquest of an island so desirable. A\r\ngreater empire-maker, Henry II, lord of a vast seacoast from the Forth\r\nto the Pyrenees, holding both sides of the Channel, needed Ireland to\r\nround off his dominions and give him command of the traffic from his\r\nEnglish ports across the Irish Sea, from his ports of the Loire and\r\nthe Garonne over the Gaulish sea. The trade was well worth the\r\nventure.\r\n\r\nNorman and French barons, with Welsh followers, and Flemings from\r\nPembroke, led the invasion that began in 1169. They were men trained\r\nto war, with armour and weapons unknown to the Irish. But they owed no\r\nsmall part of their military successes in Ireland to a policy of\r\ncraft. If the Irish fought hard to defend the lands they held in civil\r\ntenure, the churches had no great strength, and the seizing of a\r\nchurch estate led to no immediate rising out of the country. The\r\nsettled plan of the Normans, therefore, was to descend on defenceless\r\nchurch lands, and turn them into Norman strongholds; in reply to\r\ncomplaints, they pleaded that the churches were used by the hostile\r\nIrish as storing places for their goods. Their occupation gave the\r\nNormans a great military advantage, for once the churches were\r\nfortified and garrisoned with Norman skill the reduction of the\r\nsurrounding country became much easier. The Irish during this period\r\nsometimes plundered church lands, but did not occupy, annex, or\r\nfortify them. The invaders meanwhile spread over the country. French\r\nand Welsh and Flemings have left their mark in every part of Ireland,\r\nby Christian names, by names of places and families, and by loan-words\r\ntaken into Irish from the French. The English who came over went\r\nchiefly to the towns, many of them to Dublin through the Bristol\r\ntrade. Henry II himself crossed in 1171 with a great fleet and army to\r\nover-awe his too-independent barons as well as the Irish, and from the\r\nwooden palace set up for him in Dublin demanded a general oath of\r\nallegiance. The Normans took the oath, with some churchmen and\r\nhalf-a-dozen Irish chiefs.\r\n\r\nIn Henry's view this oath was a confession that the Irish knew\r\nthemselves conquered; and that the chief renounced the tribal system,\r\nand handed over the land to the king, so that he as supreme lord of\r\nall the soil could allot it to his barons, and demand in return the\r\nfeudal services common in Normandy or in England. No Irish chief,\r\nhowever, could have even understood these ideas. He knew nothing of\r\nthe feudal system, nor of a landlord in the English sense. He had no\r\npower to hand the land of the tribe over to any one. He could admit no\r\n\"conquest,\" for the seizing of a few towns and forts could not carry\r\nthe subjection of all the independent chiefdoms. Whatever Henry's\r\ntheory might be, the taking of Dublin was not the taking of an Irish\r\ncapital: the people had seen its founding as the centre of a foreign\r\nkingdom, and their own free life had continued as of old. Henry's\r\npresence there gave him no lordship: and the independent temper of\r\nthe Irish people was not likely, after their Danish experience, to be\r\ncowed by two years of war. Some cunning explanation of the oath was\r\ngiven to the Irish chiefs by the subtle Angevin king and his crafty\r\nNorman counsellors--that war was to cease, that they were to rule as\r\nfully and freely as before, and in recognition of the peace to give to\r\nHenry a formal tribute which implied no dominion.\r\n\r\nThe false display at Dublin was a deception both to the king and to\r\nthe Irish. The empty words on either side did not check for a month\r\nthe lust of conquest nor the passion of defence.\r\n\r\nOne royal object, however, was made good. The oath, claimed under\r\nfalse pretences, yielded under misunderstanding, impossible of\r\nfulfilment, was used to confer on the king a technical legal right to\r\nIreland; this legal fiction became the basis of the royal claims, and\r\nthe justification of every later act of violence.\r\n\r\nAnother fraud was added by the proclamation of papal bulls, which\r\naccording to modern research seem to have been mere forgeries. They\r\ngave the lordship of the country to Henry, and were readily accepted\r\nby the invaders and their successors. But they were held of no account\r\namong Irish annalists and writers, who make no mention of the bulls\r\nduring the next three hundred years.\r\n\r\nThus the grounds of the English title to Ireland were laid down, and\r\nit only remained to make good by the sword the fictions of law and the\r\nfalsehoods of forgers. According to these Ireland had been by the act\r\nof the natives and by the will of God conferred on a higher race.\r\nKings carved out estates for their nobles. The nobles had to conquer\r\nthe territories granted them. Each conquered tract was to be made into\r\na little England, enclosed within itself, and sharply fenced off from\r\nthe supposed sea of savagery around it. There was to be no trade with\r\nthe Irish, no intercourse, no relationship, no use of their dress,\r\nspeech, or laws, no dealings save those of conquest and slaughter. The\r\ncolonists were to form an English parliament to enact English law. A\r\nlieutenant-governor, or his deputy, was set in Dublin Castle to\r\nsuperintend the conquest and the administration. The fighting\r\ngarrison was reinforced by the planting of a militant church--bishops\r\nand clergy of foreign blood, stout men of war, ready to aid by\r\nprayers, excommunications, and the sword. A bishop of Waterford being\r\nonce sent by the Lord Justice to account to Edward I for a battle of\r\nthe Irish in which the king of Connacht and two thousand of his men\r\nlay dead, explained that \"in policy he thought it expedient to wink at\r\none knave cutting off another, and that would save the king's coffers\r\nand purchase peace to the land\"; whereat the king smiled and bade him\r\nreturn to Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe Irish were now therefore aliens in their own country. Officially\r\nthey did not exist. Their land had been parted out by kings among\r\ntheir barons \"till in title they were owners and lords of all, so as\r\nnothing was left to be granted to the natives.\" During centuries of\r\nEnglish occupation not a single law was enacted for their relief or\r\nbenefit. They were refused the protection of English law, shut out\r\nfrom the king's courts and from the king's peace. The people who had\r\ncarried the peaceful mission of a spiritual religion over England and\r\nEurope now saw that other mission planted among themselves--a\r\npolitical church bearing the sword of the conqueror, and dealing out\r\nanathemas and death in the service of a state which rewarded it with\r\ntemporal wealth and dominion.\r\n\r\nThe English attack was thus wholly different from that of the Danes:\r\nit was guided by a fixed purpose, and directed by kings who had a more\r\nabsolute power, a more compact body of soldiers, and a better filled\r\ntreasury than any other rulers in Europe. Dublin, no mere centre now\r\nof roving sea-kings, was turned into an impregnable fortress, fed from\r\nthe sea, and held by a garrison which was supported by the whole\r\nstrength of England--a fortress unconquerable by any power within\r\nIreland--a passage through which the strangers could enter at their\r\nease. The settlers were no longer left to lapse as isolated groups\r\ninto Irish life, but were linked together as a compact garrison under\r\nthe Castle government. The vigilance of Westminster never ceased, nor\r\nthe supply of its treasure, its favoured colonists, and its ablest\r\ngenerals. From Henry II to Elizabeth, the aim of the English\r\ngovernment was the same. The ground of Ireland was to be an immediate\r\nholding, \"a royal inheritance,\" of the king. On an issue so sharp and\r\ndefinite no compromise was possible. So long as the Irish claimed to\r\nhold a foot of their own land the war must continue. It lasted, in\r\nfact, for five hundred years, and at no moment was any peace possible\r\nto the Irish except by entire renunciation of their right to the\r\nactual soil of their country. If at times dealings were opened by the\r\nEnglish with an Irish chief, or a heavy sum taken to allow him to stay\r\non his land, this was no more than a temporary stratagem or a local\r\nexpedient, and in no way affected the fixed intention to gain the\r\nownership of the soil.\r\n\r\nOut of the first tumult and anarchy of war an Ireland emerged which\r\nwas roughly divided between the two peoples. In Ulster, O'Neills and\r\nO'Donnells and other tribes remained, with only a fringe of Normans on\r\nthe coast. O'Conors and other Irish clans divided Connacht, and\r\nabsorbed into the Gaelic life the incoming Norman de Burghs. The\r\nAnglo-Normans, on the other hand, established themselves powerfully in\r\nMunster and Leinster. But even here--side by side with the great lords\r\nof the invasion, earls of Ormond, and Desmond, and Kildare--there\r\nremained Irish kingdoms and the remnants of old chiefdoms,\r\nunconquered, resolute and wealthy--such as the O'Briens in the west,\r\nMacCarthys and O'Sullivans in the south, O'Conors and O'Mores in the\r\nmiddle country, MacMurroughs and O'Tooles in Leinster, and many more.\r\n\r\nIt has been held that all later misfortunes would have been averted if\r\nthe English without faltering had carried out a complete conquest, and\r\nended the dispute once for all. English kings had, indeed, every\r\ntemptation to this direct course. The wealth of the country lay spread\r\nbefore them. It was a land abounding in corn and cattle, in fish, in\r\ntimber; its manufactures were famed over all Europe; gold-mines were\r\nreported; foreign merchants flocked to its ports, and bankers and\r\nmoney-lenders from the Rhineland and Lucca, with speculators from\r\nProvence, were carrying over foreign coin, settling in the towns, and\r\ntaking land in the country. Sovereigns at Westminster--harassed with\r\nturbulent barons at home and wars abroad--looked to a conquered\r\nIreland to supply money for their treasury, soldiers for their armies,\r\nprovisions for their wars, and estates for their favourites. In haste\r\nto reap their full gains they demanded nothing better than a conquest\r\nrapid and complete. They certainly cannot be charged with dimness of\r\nintention, slackness in effort, or want of resource in dilemmas. It\r\nwould be hard to imagine any method of domination which was not\r\nused--among the varied resources of the army, the church, the lawyers,\r\nthe money-lenders, the schoolmasters, the Castle intriguers and the\r\nlandlords. The official class in Dublin, recruited every few years\r\nwith uncorrupted blood from England, urged on the war with the dogged\r\npersistence of their race.\r\n\r\nBut the conquest of the Irish nation was not so simple as it had\r\nseemed to Anglo-Norman speculators. The proposal to take the land out\r\nof the hands of an Irish people and give it to a foreign king, could\r\nonly have been carried out by the slaughter of the entire population.\r\nNo lesser effort could have turned a free tribal Ireland into a\r\ndependent feudal England.\r\n\r\nThe English kings had made a further mistake. They proposed, like\r\nlater kings of Spain in South America, to exploit Ireland for the\r\nbenefit of the crown and the metropolis, not for the welfare of any\r\nclass whatever of the inhabitants; the colonists were to be a mere\r\ngarrison to conquer and hold the land for the king. But the\r\nAnglo-Norman adventurers had gone out to find profit for themselves,\r\nnot to collect Irish wealth for London. Their \"loyalty\" failed under\r\nthat test. The kings, therefore, found themselves engaged in a double\r\nconflict, against the Irish and against their own colonists, and were\r\nevery year more entangled in the difficulties of a policy false from\r\nthe outset.\r\n\r\nYet another difficulty disclosed itself. Among the colonists a little\r\nexperience destroyed the English theory of Irish \"barbarism.\" The\r\ninvaders were drawn to their new home not only by its wealth but by\r\nits beauty, the variety and gaiety of its social life, the\r\nintelligence of its inhabitants, and the attraction of its learning\r\nand art. Settlers, moreover, could neither live nor till the lands\r\nthey had seized, nor trade in the seaports, nor find soldiers for\r\ntheir defence, without coming to terms with their Irish neighbours. To\r\nthem the way of wealth lay not in slaughter but in traffic, not in\r\ndestroying riches but in sharing them. The colonists compromised with\r\n\"the Irish enemy.\" They took to Irish dress and language; they\r\nrecognised Irish land tenure, as alone suited to the country and\r\npeople, one also that gave them peace with their farmers and\r\ncattle-drivers, and kept out of their estates the king's sheriffs and\r\ntax-gatherers; they levied troops from their tenants in the Irish\r\nmanner; they employed Irishmen in offices of trust; they paid\r\nneighbouring tribes for military service--such as to keep roads and\r\npasses open for their traders and messengers. \"English born in\r\nIreland,\" \"degenerate English,\" were as much feared by the king as the\r\n\"mere Irish.\" They were not counted \"of English birth\"; lands were\r\nresumed from them, office forbidden them. In every successive\r\ngeneration new men of pure English blood were to be sent over to serve\r\nthe king's purpose and keep in check the Ireland-born.\r\n\r\nThe Irish wars, therefore, became exceedingly confused--kings, barons,\r\ntribes, all entangled in interminable strife. Every chief, surrounded\r\nby dangers, was bound to turn his court into a place of arms thronged\r\nby men ready to drive back the next attack or start on the next foray.\r\nWhatever was the burden of military taxation no tribe dared to disarm\r\nany more than one of the European countries to-day. The Dublin\r\nofficials, meanwhile, eked out their military force by craft; they\r\ncreated and encouraged civil wars; they called on the Danes who had\r\nbecome mingled with the Irish to come out from them and resume their\r\nDanish nationality, as the only means of being allowed protection of\r\nlaw and freedom to trade. To avert the dangers of friendship and peace\r\nbetween races in Ireland they became missionaries of disorder,\r\napostles of contention. Civil wars within any country exhaust\r\nthemselves and come to a natural end. But civil wars maintained by a\r\nforeign power from without have no conclusion. If any strong leader\r\narose, Anglo-Norman or Irish, the whole force of England was called\r\nin, and the ablest commanders fetched over from the French wars, great\r\nmen of battle and plunder, to fling the province back into weakness\r\nand disorder.\r\n\r\nIn England the feudal system had been brought to great perfection--a\r\npowerful king, a state organised for common action, with a great\r\nmilitary force, a highly organised treasury, a powerful nobility, and\r\na dependent people. The Irish tribal system, on the other hand, rested\r\non a people endowed with a wide freedom, guided by an ancient\r\ntradition, and themselves the guardians of their law and of their\r\nland. They had still to show what strength lay in their spiritual\r\nideal of a nation's life to subdue the minds of their invaders, and to\r\nmake a stand against their organised force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND IRISH REVIVAL\r\n\r\n1200-1520\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first Irish revival after the Danish wars showed the strength of\r\nthe ancient Gaelic civilisation. The second victory which the genius\r\nof the people won over the minds of the new invaders was a more\r\nastonishing proof of the vitality of the Irish culture, the firm\r\nstructure of their law, and the cohesion of the people.\r\n\r\nHenry II in 1171 had led an army for \"the conquest\" of Ireland. Three\r\nhundred years later, when Henry VII in 1487 turned his thoughts to\r\nIreland he found no conquered land. An earthen ditch with a palisade\r\non the top had been raised to protect all that was left of English\r\nIreland, called the \"Pale\" from its encircling fence. Outside was a\r\ncountry of Irish language, dress, and customs. Thirty miles west of\r\nDublin was \"by west of English law.\" Norman lords had married\r\ndaughters of Irish chiefs all over the country, and made combinations\r\nand treaties with every province. Their children went to be fostered\r\nin kindly houses of the Irish. Into their own palisaded forts, lifted\r\non great mounds of earth, with three-fold entrenchments, came Irish\r\npoets singing the traditions, the love-songs, the prayers and hymns of\r\nthe Gaels. A Norman shrine of gold for St. Patrick's tooth shows how\r\nthe Norman lord of Athenry had adopted the national saint. Many\r\nsettlers changed their names to an Irish form, and taking up the clan\r\nsystem melted into the Irish population. Irish speech was so universal\r\nthat a proclamation of Henry VIII in a Dublin parliament had to be\r\ntranslated into Irish by the earl of Ormond.\r\n\r\nIrish manners had entered also into the town houses of the merchants.\r\nForeign traders welcomed \"natives\" to the seaports, employed them,\r\nbought their wares, took them into partnership, married with them,\r\nallowed them to plead Irish law in their courts--and not only that,\r\nbut they themselves wore the forbidden Irish dress, talked Irish with\r\nthe other townsfolk, and joined in their national festivities and\r\nceremonies and songs. Almost to the very gates of Dublin, in the\r\ncentre of what should have been pure English land, the merchants went\r\nriding Irish fashion, in Irish dress, and making merry with their\r\nforbidden Irish clients.\r\n\r\nThis Irish revival has been attributed to a number of causes--to an\r\ninvasion of Edward Bruce in 1315, to the \"degeneracy\" of the Normans,\r\nto the vice of the Irish, to the Wars of the Roses, to the want of\r\nenergy of Dublin Castle, to the over-education of Irish people in\r\nOxford, to agitation and lawyers. The cause lay far deeper. It lay in\r\nthe rich national civilisation which the Irish genius had built up,\r\nstrong in its courageous democracy, in its broad sympathies, in its\r\nwidespread culture, in its freedom, and in its humanities. So long as\r\nthe Irish language preserved to the people their old culture they\r\nnever failed to absorb into their life every people that came among\r\nthem. It was only when they lost hold of the tradition of their\r\nfathers and their old social order that this great influence fell\r\nfrom them, and strangers no longer yielded to their power.\r\n\r\nThe social fusion of Normans and Irish was the starting-point of a\r\nlively civilisation to which each race brought its share. Together\r\nthey took a brilliant part in the commerce which was broadening over\r\nthe world. The Irish were great travellers; they sailed the Adriatic,\r\njourneyed in the Levant, visited the factories of Egypt, explored\r\nChina, with all the old love of knowledge and infinite curiosity. They\r\nwere as active and ingenious in business as the Normans themselves.\r\nBesides exporting raw materials, Irish-made linen and cloth and cloaks\r\nand leather were carried as far as Russia and Naples; Norman lords and\r\nIrish chieftains alike took in exchange velvets, silks and satins,\r\ncloth of gold and embroideries, wines and spices. Irish goldsmiths\r\nmade the rich vessels that adorned the tables both of Normans and\r\nIrish. Irish masons built the new churches of continental design,\r\ncarving at every turn their own traditional Irish ornaments. Irish\r\nscribes illuminated manuscripts which were as much praised in a Norman\r\ncastle as in an Irish fort. Both peoples used translations into Irish\r\nmade by Gaelic scholars from the fashionable Latin books of the\r\nContinent. Both races sent students and professors to every university\r\nin Europe--men recognised of deep knowledge among the most learned men\r\nof Italy and France. A kind of national education was being worked\r\nout. Not one of the Irish chiefdoms allowed its schools to perish, and\r\nto these ancient schools the settlers in the towns added others of\r\ntheir own, to which the Irish also in time flocked, so that youths of\r\nthe two races learned together. As Irish was the common language, so\r\nLatin was the second tongue for cultivated people and for all men of\r\nbusiness in their continental trade. The English policy made English\r\nthe language of traitors to their people, but of no use either for\r\ntrade or literature.\r\n\r\nThe uplifting of the national ideal was shown in the fourteenth and\r\nfifteenth centuries by a revival of learning like that which followed\r\nthe Danish wars. Not one of the hereditary houses of historians,\r\nlawyers, poets, physicians, seems to have failed: we find them at work\r\nin the mountains of Donegal, along the Shannon, in lake islands,\r\namong the bare rocks of Clare, in the plains of Meath, in the valleys\r\nof Munster. In astronomy Irishmen were still first in Europe. In\r\nmedicine they had all the science of their age. Nearly all our\r\nknowledge of Irish literature comes from copies of older works made by\r\nhundreds of industrious scribes of this period. From time to time\r\nAssemblies of all the learned men were called together by patriotic\r\nchiefs, or by kings rising into high leadership--\"coming to Tara,\" as\r\nthe people said. The old order was maintained in these national\r\nfestivals. Spacious avenues of white houses were made ready for poets,\r\nstreets of peaked hostels for musicians, straight roads of smooth\r\nconical-roofed houses for chroniclers, another avenue for bards and\r\njugglers, and so on; and on the bright surface of the pleasant hills\r\nsleeping-booths of woven branches for the companies. From sea to sea\r\nscholars and artists gathered to show their skill to the men of\r\nIreland; and in these glorious assemblies the people learned anew the\r\nwealth of their civilisation, and celebrated with fresh ardour the\r\nunity of the Irish nation.\r\n\r\nIt was no wonder that in this high fervour of the country the\r\nAnglo-Normans, like the Danes and the Northumbrians before them, were\r\nwon to a civilisation so vital and impassioned, so human and gay. But\r\nthe mixed civilisation found no favour with the government; the \"wild\r\nIrish\" and the \"degenerate English\" were no better than \"brute\r\nbeasts,\" the English said, abandoned to \"filthy customs\" and to \"a\r\ndamnable law that was no law, hateful to God and man.\" Every measure\r\nwas taken to destroy the growing amity of the peoples, not only by\r\nembroiling them in war, but by making union of Ireland impossible in\r\nreligion or in education, and by destroying public confidence. The new\r\ncentral organisation of the Irish church made it a powerful weapon in\r\nEnglish hands. An Englishman was at once put in every archbishopric\r\nand every principal see, a prelate who was often a Castle official as\r\nwell, deputy, chancellor, justice, treasurer, or the like, or a good\r\nsoldier--in any case hostile to every Irish affection. A national\r\nchurch in the old Irish sense disappeared; in the English idea the\r\nchurch was to destroy the nation. Higher education was also denied to\r\nboth races. No Irish university could live under the eye of an English\r\nprimate of Armagh, and every attempt of Anglo-Normans to set up a\r\nuniversity for Ireland at Dublin or Drogheda was instantly crushed. To\r\navert general confidence and mutual understanding, an alien class was\r\nmaintained in the country, who for considerations of wealth, power, a\r\nprivileged position, betrayed the peace of Ireland to the profit of\r\nEngland. No pains, for example, were spared by the kings to conciliate\r\nand use so important a house as that of the earls of Ormond. For\r\nnearly two hundred years, as it happened, the heirs of this house were\r\nalways minors, held in wardship by the king. English training at his\r\ncourt, visits to London, knighthoods and honours there, high posts in\r\nIreland, prospects of new conquests of Irish land, a winking of\r\ngovernment officials at independent privileges used on their estates\r\nby Ormond lords--such influences tied each heir in turn to England,\r\nand separated them from Irish interests--a \"loyal\" house, said the\r\nEnglish--\"fair and false as Ormond,\" said the people of Ireland.\r\n\r\nBoth races suffered under this foreign misrule. Both were brayed in\r\nthe same mortar. Both were driven to the demand for home rule. The\r\nnational movement never flagged for a single generation. Never for a\r\nmoment did the Irish cease from the struggle; in the swell and tumult\r\nof that tossing sea commanders emerged now in one province, now in\r\nanother, each to fall back into the darkness while the next pressed on\r\nto take his place. An Anglo-Norman parliament claimed (1459) that\r\nIreland was by its constitution separate from the laws and statutes of\r\nEngland, and prayed to have a separate coinage for their land as in\r\nthe kingdom of England. Confederacies of Irish and Anglo-Normans were\r\nformed, one following another in endless and hopeless succession.\r\nThrough all civil strife we may plainly see the steady drift of the\r\npeoples to a common patriotism. There was panic in England at these\r\nceaseless efforts to restore an Irish nation, for \"Ireland,\" English\r\nstatesmen said, \"was as good as gone if a wild Irish wyrlinge should\r\nbe chosen there as king.\"\r\n\r\nFor a time it seemed as if the house of the Fitzgeralds, the most\r\npowerful house in Ireland, might mediate between the peoples whose\r\nblood, English and Irish, they shared. Earl Gerald of Desmond led a\r\ndemand for home rule in 1341, and that Ireland should not be governed\r\nby \"needy men sent from England, without knowledge of Ireland or its\r\ncircumstances.\" Earl Gerald the Rhymer of the same house (1359) was a\r\npatriot leader too--a witty and ingenious composer of Irish poetry,\r\nwho excelled all the English and many of the Irish in the knowledge of\r\nthe Irish language, poetry, and history, and of other learning. A\r\nlater Earl Gerald (1416), foster-son of O'Brien and cousin of Henry\r\nVI, was complimented by the Republic of Florence, in a letter\r\nrecalling the Florentine origin of the Fitzgeralds, for the glory he\r\nbrought to that city, since its citizens had possessions as far as\r\nHungary and Greece, and now \"through you and yours bear sway even in\r\nIbernia, the most remote island of the world.\" In Earl Thomas (1467)\r\nthe Irish saw the first \"foreigner\" to be the martyr of their cause.\r\nHe had furthered trade of European peoples with Irishmen; he had\r\nurgently pressed union of the races; he had planned a university for\r\nIreland at Drogheda (Armagh having been long destroyed by the\r\nEnglish). As his reward he was beheaded without trial by the earl of\r\nWorcester famed as \"the Butcher,\" who had come over with a claim to\r\nsome of the Desmond lands in Cork. His people saw in his death \"the\r\nruin of Ireland\"; they laid his body with bitter lamentations by the\r\nAtlantic at Tralee, where the ocean wind moaning in the caverns still\r\nsounds to the peasants as \"the Desmond's keen.\"\r\n\r\nOther Fitzgeralds, earls of Kildare, who had married into every\r\nleading Irish house, took up in their turn the national cause. Garrett\r\nMor \"the great\" (1477-1513), married to the cousin of Henry VII, made\r\nclose alliances with every Irish chief, steadily spread his power over\r\nthe land, and kept up the family relations with Florence; and by his\r\nwit, his daring, the gaiety of his battle with slander, fraud, and\r\nviolence, won great authority. His son Garrett inherited and enlarged\r\nhis great territory. Maynooth under him was one of the richest earls'\r\nhouses of that time. When he rode out in his scarlet cloak he was\r\nfollowed by four hundred Irish spearmen. His library was half of Irish\r\nbooks; he made his English wife read, write, and speak perfectly the\r\nIrish tongue; he had for his chief poet an Irishman, \"full of the\r\ngrace of God and of learning\"; his secretary was employed to write for\r\nhis library \"divers chronicles\" of Ireland. The Irish loved him for\r\nhis justice, for his piety, and that he put on them no arbitrary tax.\r\nBy a singular charm of nature he won the hearts of all, wife, son,\r\njailor in London Tower, and English lords.\r\n\r\nHis whole policy was union in his country, and Ireland for the Irish.\r\nThe lasting argument for self-government as against rule from over-sea\r\nwas heard in his cry to Wolsey and the lords at Westminster--\"You hear\r\nof a case as it were in a dream, and feel not the smart that vexeth\r\nus.\" He attempted to check English interference with private subjects\r\nin Ireland. He refused to admit that a commission to Cardinal Wolsey\r\nas legate for England gave him authority in Ireland. The mark of his\r\ngenius lay above all in his resolve to close dissensions and to put\r\nan end to civil wars. When as deputy he rode out to war against\r\ndisturbed tribes, his first business was not to fight, but to call an\r\nassembly in the Irish manner which should decide the quarrel by\r\narbitration according to law. He \"made peace,\" his enemies said, and\r\nthe nightmare of forced dissension gave way before this new\r\nstatesmanship of national union.\r\n\r\nNever were the Irish \"so corrupted by affection\" for a lord deputy,\r\nnever were they so obedient, both from fear and from love, so Henry\r\nVIII was warned. In spite of official intrigues, through all eddying\r\naccidents, the steady pressure of the country itself was towards\r\nunion.\r\n\r\nThe great opportunity had come to weld together the two races in\r\nIreland, and to establish a common civilisation by a leader to whom\r\nboth peoples were perfectly known, whose sympathies were engaged in\r\nboth, and who as deputy of the English king had won the devoted\r\nconfidence of the Irish people.\r\n\r\nThere was one faction alone which no reason could convert--the alien\r\nminority that held interests and possessions in both islands, and\r\nopenly used England to advance their power and Ireland to increase\r\ntheir wealth. They had no country, for neither England nor Ireland\r\ncould be counted such. They knew how to darken ignorance and inflame\r\nprejudice in London against their fellow-countrymen in Ireland--\"the\r\nstrange savage nature of the people,\" \"savage vile poor persons which\r\nnever did know or feel wealth or civility,\" \"having no knowledge of\r\nthe laws of God or of the king,\" nor any way to know them save through\r\nthe good offices of these slanderers, apostles of their own virtue.\r\nThe anti-national minority would have had no strength if left alone to\r\nface the growing toleration in Ireland. In support from England it\r\nfound its sole security--and through its aid Ireland was flung back\r\ninto disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE TAKING OF THE LAND\r\n\r\n1520-1625\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry VIII, like Henry II, was not concerned to give \"civilisation\" to\r\nIreland. He was concerned to take the land. His reasons were the same.\r\nIf he possessed the soil in his own right, apart from the English\r\nparliament, and commanded its fighting-men and its wealth, he could\r\nbeat down rebellion in England, smite Scotland into obedience, conquer\r\nFrance, and create an empire of bounds unknown--and in time of danger\r\nwhere so sure a shelter for a flying sovereign? Claims were again\r\nrevived to \"our rightful inheritance\"; quibbles of law once more\r\nserved for the king's \"title to the land\"; there was another great day\r\nof deception in Dublin. Henry asked the title of King of Ireland\r\ninstead of Lord, and offered to the chiefs in return full security for\r\ntheir lands. For months of subtle preparation his promises were\r\nexplicit. All cause of offence was carefully taken away. Finally a\r\nparliament was summoned (1541) of lords carefully bribed and commons\r\ncarefully packed--the very pattern, in fact, of that which was later\r\ncalled to vote the Union. And while they were by order voting the\r\ntitle, the king and council were making arrangements together to\r\nrender void both sides of the bargain. First the wording of the title\r\nwas so altered as to take away any value in the \"common consent\" of\r\nparliament, since the king asserted his title to Ireland by\r\ninheritance and conquest, before and beyond all mandate of the popular\r\nwill. And secondly it was arranged that Henry was under no obligation\r\nby negotiations or promises as to the land. For since, by the\r\ncouncil's assurance to the king on the day the title was passed, there\r\nwas no land occupied by any \"disobedient\" people which was not really\r\nthe king's property by ancient inheritance or by confiscation, Henry\r\nmight do as he would with his own. Royal concessions too must depend\r\non how much revenue could be extracted from them to keep up suitably\r\nthe title of king--on whether it was judicious to give Irishmen titles\r\nwhich they might afterwards plead to be valid--on whether Henry would\r\nfind the promised grants convenient in case he chose later to proceed\r\nto \"conquest and extermination.\"\r\n\r\nParliament was dismissed for thirteen years, Henry, in fact, had\r\nexactly fulfilled the project of mystification he proposed twenty\r\nyears before--\"to be politically and secretly handled.\" Every trace of\r\nIrish law and land tenure must finally be abolished so that the soil\r\nshould lie at the king's will alone, but this was to be done at first\r\nby secret and politic measures, here a little and there a little, so\r\nthat, as he said, the Irish lords should as yet conceive no suspicion\r\nthat they were to be \"constrained to live under our law or put from\r\nall the lands by them now detained.\" \"Politic practices,\" said Henry,\r\nwould serve till such time as the strength of the Irish should be\r\ndiminished, their leaders taken from them, and division put among\r\nthemselves so that they join not together. If there had been any truth\r\nor consideration for Ireland in the royal compact some hope of\r\ncompromise and conciliation might have opened. But the whole scheme\r\nwas rooted and grounded in falsehood, and Ireland had yet to learn how\r\nfar sufferings by the quibbles and devices of law might exceed the\r\ndisasters of open war. Chiefs could be ensnared one by one in\r\nmisleading contracts, practically void. A false claimant could be put\r\non a territory and supported by English soldiers in a civil war, till\r\nthe actual chief was exiled or yielded the land to the king's\r\nownership. No chief, true or false, had power to give away the\r\npeople's land, and the king was face to face with an indignant people,\r\nwho refused to admit an illegal bargain. Then came a march of soldiers\r\nover the district, hanging, burning, shooting \"the rebels,\" casting\r\nthe peasants out on the hillsides. There was also the way of\r\n\"conquest.\" The whole of the inhabitants were to be exiled, and the\r\ncountries made vacant and waste for English peopling: the sovereign's\r\nrule would be immediate and peremptory over those whom he had thus\r\nplanted by his sole will, and Ireland would be kept subject in a way\r\nunknown in England; then \"the king might say Ireland was clearly won,\r\nand after that he would be at little cost and receive great profits,\r\nand men and money at pleasure.\" There would be no such difficulty,\r\nHenry's advisers said as those of Henry II had said before, to \"subdue\r\nor exile them as hath been thought,\" for from the settled lands\r\nplantation could be spread into the surrounding territories, and the\r\nIrishry steadily pushed back into the sea. Henceforth it became a\r\nfixed policy to \"exterminate and exile the country people of the\r\nIrishry.\" Whether they submitted or not, the king was to \"inhabit\r\ntheir country\" with English blood. But again as in the twelfth century\r\nit was the king and the metropolis that were to profit, not any class\r\nof inhabitants of Ireland.\r\n\r\nA series of great Confiscations put through an enslaved Pale\r\nparliament made smooth the way of conquest. An Act of 1536 for the\r\nattainder of the earl of Kildare confiscated his estates to the king,\r\nthat is, the main part of Leinster. In 1570 the bulk of Ulster, as\r\nterritory of the \"traitor\" Shane O'Neill, was declared forfeited in\r\nthe same way. And in 1586 the chief part of Munster, the lordship of\r\nthe \"traitor\" earl of Desmond. Another Act of 1536 forfeited to the\r\ncrown all ancient claims of English lords to lands which had been\r\ngranted to them, and afterwards recovered by the original Irish\r\nowners. Another in 1537 vested in the king all the lands of the\r\ndissolved monasteries. By these various titles given to the crown, it\r\nwas hard for any acres to slip through unawares, English or Irish. An\r\nAct of 1569 moreover reduced all Ireland to shire land; in other\r\nwords, all Irish chiefs who had made indentures with the crown were\r\ndeprived of all the benefits which were included in such indentures,\r\nand the brehon or Irish law, with all its protection to the poor, was\r\nabolished.\r\n\r\nThese laws and confiscations gave to the new sovereigns of the Irish\r\nthe particular advantage that if their subjects should resist the\r\ntaking of the land, they were legally \"rebels,\" and as such outside\r\nthe laws of war. It was this new fiction of law that gave the Tudor\r\nwars their unsurpassed horror. Thus began what Bacon called the \"wild\r\nchase on the wild Irishmen.\" The forfeiture of land of the tribe for\r\nthe crime of a chief was inconceivable in Irish law; the claim of the\r\ncommonalty to unalterable possession of their soil was deeply engraven\r\nin the hearts of the people, who stood together to hold their land,\r\nbelieving justice and law to be on their side, and the right of near\r\ntwo thousand years of ordered possession. At a prodigious price, at\r\ninconceivable cost of human woe, the purging of the soil from the\r\nIrish race was begun. Such mitigations as the horrors of war allow\r\nwere forbidden to these \"rebels\" by legal fiction. Torturers and\r\nhangmen went out with the soldiers. There was no protection for any\r\nsoul; the old, the sick, infants, women, scholars; any one of them\r\nmight be a landholder, or a carrier on of the tradition of the tribal\r\nowners, and was in any case a rebel appointed to death. No quarter was\r\nallowed, no faith kept, and no truce given. Chiefs were made to \"draw\r\nand carry,\" to abase them before the tribes. Poets and historians were\r\nslaughtered and their books and genealogies burned, so that no man\r\n\"might know his own grandfather\" and all Irishmen be confounded in the\r\nsame ignorance and abasement, all glories gone, and all rights lost.\r\nThe great object of the government was to destroy the whole tradition,\r\nwipe out the Gaelic memories, and begin a new English life.\r\n\r\nBut even with all legal aids to extermination the land war proved more\r\ndifficult than the English had expected. It lasted for some seventy\r\nyears. The Irish were inexhaustible in defence, prodigious in courage,\r\nand endured hardships that Englishmen could not survive. The most\r\npowerful governors that England could supply were sent over, and\r\nfurnished with English armies and stores. Fleets held the harbours,\r\nand across all the seas from Newfoundland to Dantzic gathered in\r\nprovisions for the soldiers. Armies fed from the sea-ports chased the\r\nIrish through the winter months, when the trees were bare and naked\r\nand the kine without milk, killing every living thing and burning\r\nevery granary of corn, so that famine should slay what the sword had\r\nlost. Out of the woods the famishing Irish came creeping on their\r\nhands, for their legs would not bear them, speaking like ghosts crying\r\nout of their graves, if they found a few water-cresses flocking as to\r\na feast; so that in short space there were none almost left and a most\r\npopulous and plentiful country suddenly left void of man and beast--a\r\nplace where no voice was heard in ears save woe and fear and grief, a\r\nplace where there was no pause for consolation nor appearance of joy\r\non face.\r\n\r\nThus according to the English king's forecast was \"the strength of the\r\nIrish diminished and their captains taken from them.\" One great house\r\nafter another was swept out of Irish life. In 1529 the great earl of\r\nKildare died of a broken heart in the Tower at the news that his son\r\nhad been betrayed by a forged letter into a rising. His five brothers\r\nand his son, young Silken Thomas, captured by a false pledge of\r\nsafety, were clapped all six of them into the Tower and hanged in\r\nLondon. The six outraged corpses at Tyburn marked the close of the\r\nfirst and last experiment in which a great ruler, sharing the blood of\r\nthe two races, practised in the customs of both countries, would have\r\nled Ireland in a way of peace, and brought about through equal\r\nprosperity and order a lasting harmony between the English and Irish\r\npeople. Three hundred years later an old blackened pedigree kept in\r\nthe Tower showed against the names of half the Fitzgeralds up to that\r\ntime the words \"Beheaded\" or \"Attainted\"--so terrible were the long\r\nefforts to extinguish the talent and subdue the patriotism of that\r\ngreat family.\r\n\r\nOrmond, too, was \"to be bridled.\" It was said his house was in no mood\r\nto hand over the \"rule and obedience\" of south Ireland to the king. At\r\na feast at Ely House in Holborn (1547) the earl and seventeen of his\r\nfollowers lay dead out of thirty-five who had been poisoned. No\r\ninquiry was made into that crime. \"God called him to His mercy,\" the\r\nIrish said of this patriot Ormond, \"before he could see that day after\r\nwhich doubtless he longed and looked--the restitution of the house of\r\nKildare.\" His son was held fast in London to be brought up, as far as\r\neducation could do it, an Englishman.\r\n\r\nThe third line of the Anglo-Norman leaders was laid low. The earl of\r\nDesmond, after twenty-five years of alternate prison and war, saw the\r\nchief leaders of his house hanged or slain, before he himself was\r\nkilled in 1583: and his wretched son, born in the Tower, was brought\r\nfrom that prison to be shown to his heart-broken people--stunted in\r\nbody, enfeebled in mind, half an idiot, a protestant--\"the Tower\r\nEarl,\" \"the Queen's Earl,\" cried the people.\r\n\r\nThe Irish chiefs were also broken by guile and assassination. O'Brien\r\nwas separated from his people by a peerage (1543), an English\r\ninauguration without the ancient rites as head of his lands, and an\r\nEnglish guard of soldiers (1558). That house played no further part in\r\nthe Irish struggle.\r\n\r\nThe chief warrior of the north and terror of Elizabeth's generals was\r\nShane O'Neill. The deputy Sidney devised many plots to poison or kill\r\nthe man he could not conquer, and at last brought over from Scotland\r\nhired assassins who accomplished the murder (1567). A map made in the\r\nreign of Elizabeth marked the place of the crime that relieved England\r\nof her greatest fear--\"Here Shane O'Neill was slain.\" After him the\r\nstruggle of the north to keep their land and independence was\r\nmaintained by negotiation and by war for forty years, under the\r\nleading of the greatest of Irish statesmen and generals Hugh O'Neill\r\nearl of Tyrone, and the soldier-patriot Aedh Ruadh O'Donnell earl of\r\nTirconnell. English intrigue triumphed when Red Hugh was poisoned by a\r\nsecret agent (1602) and when by a crafty charge of conspiracy his\r\nbrother Rory O'Donnell and Hugh O'Neill were driven from their country\r\n(1607). The flight of the earls marked the destruction by violence of\r\nthe old Gaelic polity--that federation of tribes which had made of\r\ntheir common country the storehouse of Europe for learning, the centre\r\nof the noblest mission-work that the continent ever knew, the home of\r\narts and industries, the land of a true democracy where men held the\r\nfaith of a people owning their soil, instructed in their traditions,\r\nand themselves guardians of their national life.\r\n\r\nHenry VIII had found Ireland a land of Irish civilisation and law,\r\nwith a people living by tribal tenure, and two races drawing together\r\nto form a new self-governing nation. A hundred years later, when\r\nElizabeth and James I had completed his work, all the great leaders,\r\nAnglo-Irish and Irish, had disappeared, the people had been half\r\nexterminated, alien and hostile planters set in their place, tribal\r\ntenure obliterated, every trace of Irish law swept clean from the\r\nIrish statute-book, and an English form of state government\r\neffectively established.\r\n\r\nWas this triumph due to the weakness of tribal government and the\r\nsuperior value of the feudal land tenure? How far, in fact, did the\r\nIrish civilisation invite and lend itself to this destruction?\r\n\r\nIt has been said that it was by Irish soldiers that Irish liberties\r\nwere destroyed. The Tudors and their councillors were under no such\r\nillusions. Their fear was that the Irish, if they suspected the real\r\nintention of the English, would all combine in one war; and in fact\r\nwhen the purpose of the government became clear in Ireland an English\r\narmy of conquest had to be created. \"Have no dread nor fear,\" cried\r\nRed Hugh to his Irishmen, \"of the great numbers of the soldiers of\r\nLondon, nor of the strangeness of their weapons and arms.\" Order after\r\norder went out to \"weed the bands of Irish,\" to purge the army of all\r\n\"such dangerous people.\" Soldiers from England and from Berwick were\r\nbrought over at double the pay of the Irish. For warmth and comfort\r\nthey were clothed in Irish dress, only distinguished by red crosses on\r\nback and breast; and so the sight was seen of English soldiers in\r\nIrish clothing tearing from Irish men and women their Irish garments\r\nas the forbidden dress of traitors and rebels. Some official of\r\nElizabeth's time made a list to please the English of a few names of\r\nIrishmen traitorously slain by other Irishmen. There were murderers\r\nwho had been brought up from childhood in an English house, detached\r\nfrom their own people; others were sent out to save their lives by\r\nbringing the head of a \"rebel.\" The temper of the Irish people is\r\nbetter seen in the constant fidelity with which the whole people of\r\nUlster and of Munster sheltered and protected for years O'Neill and\r\nDesmond and many another leader with a heavy price on his head. Not\r\nthe poorest herdsman of the mountains touched the English gold.\r\n\r\nThe military difficulties of the Irish, however, were such as to\r\nbaffle skill and courage. England had been drilled by the kings that\r\nconquered her, and by the foreign wars she waged, into a powerful\r\nmilitary nation by land and sea. Newly discovered gunpowder gave Henry\r\nVII the force of artillery. Henry VIII had formed the first powerful\r\nfleet. The new-found gold of Brazil, the wealth of the Spanish main,\r\nhad made England immensely rich. In this moment of growing strength\r\nthe whole might of Great Britain was thrown on Ireland, the smaller\r\nisland. The war, too, had a peculiar animosity; the fury of Protestant\r\nfanaticism was the cloak for the king's ambition, the resolve of\r\nEnglish traders to crush Irish competition, the greed of prospective\r\nplanters. No motive was lacking to increase its violence. Ireland, on\r\nthe other hand, never conquered, and contemplating no conquest on her\r\npart, was not organised as an aggressive and military nation. Her\r\nnational spirit was of another type. But whatever had been her\r\norganisation it is doubtful whether any device could have saved her\r\nfrom the force of the English invasion. Dublin could never be closed\r\nfrom within against enemies coming across the sea. The island was too\r\nsmall to give any means of escape to defeated armies while they were\r\npreparing for a new defence. They could not disappear, for example,\r\nlike the Dutch of the Cape Colony into vast desert regions which gave\r\nthem shelter while they built up a new state. Every fugitive within\r\nthe circuit of Ireland could be presently found and hunted down. The\r\ntribal system, too, which the Tudor sovereigns found, was no longer in\r\nfull possession of Ireland; the defence was now carried on not by a\r\ntribal Gaelic people but by a mixed race, half feudal and half tribal\r\nby tradition. But it was the old Irish inheritance of national freedom\r\nwhich gave to Ireland her desperate power of defence, so that it was\r\nonly after such prodigious efforts of war and plantation that the\r\nbodies of her people were subdued, while their minds still remained\r\nfree and unenslaved.\r\n\r\nIf, moreover, the Irish system had disappeared so had the English. As\r\nwe shall see the battle between the feudal tradition and the tribal\r\ntradition in Ireland had ended in the violent death of both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL FAITH OF THE IRISH\r\n\r\n_c._ 1600--_c._ 1660\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen already two revivals of Irish life, when after the Danish\r\nsettlement, and after the Norman, the native civilisation triumphed.\r\nEven now, after confiscations and plantations, the national tradition\r\nwas still maintained with unswerving fidelity. Amid contempt,\r\npersecution, proscription, death, the outcast Irish cherished their\r\nlanguage and poetry, their history and law, with the old pride and\r\ndevotion. In that supreme and unselfish loyalty to their race they\r\nfound dignity in humiliation and patience in disaster, and have left,\r\nout of the depths of their poverty and sorrow, one of the noblest\r\nexamples in history.\r\n\r\nTheir difficulties were almost inconceivable. The great dispersion had\r\nbegun of Irish deported, exiled, or cast out by emigration. Twenty\r\nthousand Irish were reported in a single island of the West Indies in\r\n1643; thirty thousand were said to be wandering about Europe; in 1653\r\nfour thousand soldiers were transported to Flanders for the war of the\r\nking of Spain. Numbers went to seek the education forbidden at home in\r\na multitude of Irish colleges founded abroad. They became chancellors\r\nof universities, professors, high officials in every European state--a\r\nKerry man physician to the king of Poland; another Kerry man confessor\r\nto the queen of Portugal and sent by the king on an embassy to Louis\r\nXIV; a Donegal man, O'Glacan, physician and privy councillor to the\r\nking of France, and a very famed professor of medicine in the\r\nuniversities of Toulouse and Bologna (1646-1655); and so on. We may\r\nask whether in the history of the world there was cast out of any\r\ncountry such genius, learning, and industry, as the English flung, as\r\nit were, into the sea. With every year the number of exiles grew. \"The\r\nsame to me,\" wrote one, \"are the mountain or ocean, Ireland or the\r\nwest of Spain; I have shut and made fast the gates of sorrow over my\r\nheart.\"\r\n\r\nAs for the Irish at home, every vestige of their tradition was\r\ndoomed--their religion was forbidden, and the Staff of Patrick and\r\nCross of Columcille destroyed, with every other national relic; their\r\nschools were scattered, their learned men hunted down, their books\r\nburned; native industries were abolished; the inauguration chairs of\r\ntheir chiefs were broken in pieces, and the law of the race torn up,\r\ncodes of inheritance, of land tenure, of contract between neighbours\r\nor between lord and man. The very image of Justice which the race had\r\nfashioned for itself was shattered. Love of country and every\r\nattachment of race and history became a crime, and even Irish language\r\nand dress were forbidden under penalty of outlawry or excommunication.\r\n\"No more shall any laugh there,\" wrote the poet, \"or children gambol;\r\nmusic is choked, the Irish language chained.\" The people were wasted\r\nby thousands in life and in death. The invaders supposed the\r\ndegradation of the Irish race to be at last completed. \"Their youth\r\nand gentry are destroyed in the rebellion or gone to France,\" wrote\r\none: \"those that are left are destitute of horses, arms and money,\r\ncapacity and courage. Five in six of the Irish are poor, insignificant\r\nslaves, fit for nothing but to hew wood and draw water.\" Such were the\r\nignorant judgments of the new people, an ignorance shameful and\r\ncriminal.\r\n\r\nThe Irish, meanwhile, at home and in the dispersion, were seeking to\r\nsave out of the wreck their national traditions. Three centres were\r\nformed of this new patriotic movement--in Rome, in Louvain, and in\r\nIreland itself.\r\n\r\nAn Irish College of Franciscans was established in Rome (1625) by the\r\nefforts of Luke Wadding, a Waterford man, divine of the Spanish\r\nembassy at Rome. The Pope granted to the Irish the church of St.\r\nIsidore, patron of Madrid, which had been occupied by Spanish\r\nFranciscans. Luke Wadding, founder and head of the college, was one of\r\nthe most extraordinary men of his time for his prodigious erudition,\r\nthe greatest school-man of that age, and an unchanging and impassioned\r\npatriot. He prepared the first full edition of the works of the great\r\nIrish scholastic philosopher Duns Scotus, with the help of his\r\nfellow-countrymen, Thomas Strange, Anthony Hickey, John Ponce of Cork,\r\nHugh MacCawell of Tyrone; and projected a general history of Ireland\r\nfor which materials were being collected in 1628 by Thomas Walsh,\r\narchbishop of Cashel. The College was for the service of \"the whole\r\nnation,\" for all Irishmen, no matter from what province, \"so long as\r\nthey be Irish.\" They were bound by rule to speak Irish, and an Irish\r\nbook was read during meals.\r\n\r\nNo spot should be more memorable to Irishmen than the site of the\r\nFranciscan College of St. Antony of Padua at Louvain. A small\r\nmonastery of the Freres de Charite contains the few pathetic relics\r\nthat are left of the noble company of Irish exiles who gathered there\r\nfrom 1609 for mutual comfort and support, and of the patriots and\r\nsoldiers laid to rest among them--O'Neills, O'Dohertys, O'Donnells,\r\nLynches, Murphys, and the rest, from every corner of Ireland. \"Here I\r\nbreak off till morning,\" wrote one who laboured on a collection of\r\nIrish poems from 1030 to 1630, \"and I in gloom and grief; and during\r\nmy life's length unless only that I might have one look at Ireland.\"\r\nThe fathers had mostly come of the old Irish literary clans, and were\r\ntrained in the traditional learning of their race; such as Father\r\nO'Mulloy, distinguished in his deep knowledge of the later poetic\r\nmetres, of which he wrote in his Latin and Irish Grammar; or\r\nBonaventura O'h'Eoghasa, trained among the poets of Ireland, who left\r\n\"her holy hills of beauty\" with lamentation to \"try another trade\"\r\nwith the Louvain brotherhood. Steeped in Irish lore the Franciscans\r\ncarried on the splendid record of the Irish clergy as the\r\ntwice-beloved guardians of the inheritance of their race. \"Those\r\nfathers,\" an Irish scholar of that day wrote, \"stood forward when she\r\n(Ireland) was reduced to the greatest distress, nay, threatened with\r\ncertain destruction, and vowed that the memory of the glorious deeds\r\nof their ancestors should not be consigned to the same earth that\r\ncovered the bodies of her children ... that the ancient glory of\r\nIreland should not be entombed by the same convulsion which deprived\r\nthe Irish of the lands of their fathers and of all their property.\"\r\nMore fortunate than scholars in Ireland they had a printing-press; and\r\nused it to send out Irish grammars, glossaries, catechisms, poems.\r\nHugh Mac an-Bhaird of Donegal undertook to compile the _Acta\r\nSanctorum_, for which a lay-brother, Michael O'Clery, collected\r\nmaterials in Ireland for ten years, and Patrick Fleming of Louth\r\ngathered records in Europe. At Hugh's death, in 1635, the task was\r\ntaken up by Colgan, born at Culdaff on the shore of Inishowen (+1658).\r\nThe work of the fathers was in darkness and sorrow. \"I am wasting and\r\nperishing with grief,\" wrote Hugh Bourke to Luke Wadding, \"to see how\r\ninsensibly nigher and nigher draws the catastrophe which must inflict\r\nmortal wounds upon our country.\"\r\n\r\nIreland herself, however, remained the chief home of historical\r\nlearning in the broad national sense. Finghin Mac Carthy Riabhach, a\r\nMunster chief, skilled in old and modern Irish, Latin, English, and\r\nSpanish, wrote a history of Ireland to the Norman invasion in the\r\nbeautiful hand taught him by Irish scribes; it was written while he\r\nlay imprisoned in London from 1589 to 1626, mad at times through\r\ndespair. One of a neighbouring race of seafaring chiefs, O'Sullivan\r\nBeare, an emigrant and captain in the Spanish navy, published in 1621\r\nhis indignant recital of the Elizabethan wars in Ireland. It was in\r\nhiding from the president of Munster, in the wood of Aharlo, that\r\nFather Geoffrey Keating made (before 1633) his Irish history down to\r\nthe Norman settlement--written for the masses in clear and winning\r\nstyle, the most popular book perhaps ever written in Irish, and copied\r\nthroughout the country by hundreds of eager hands. In the north\r\nmeanwhile Michael O'Clery and his companions, two O'Clerys of Donegal,\r\ntwo O'Maelchonaires of Roscommon, and O'Duibhgeanain of Leitrim, were\r\nwriting the _Annals of the Four Masters_ (1632-6); all of them\r\nbelonging to hereditary houses of chroniclers. In that time of sorrow,\r\nfearing the destruction of every record of his people, O'Clery\r\ntravelled through all Ireland to gather up what could be saved,\r\n\"though it was difficult to collect them to one place.\" There is still\r\npreserved a manuscript by Caimhin, abbot of Iniscaltra about 650,\r\nwhich was given to O'Clery by the neighbouring Mac Brodys who had kept\r\nit safe for a thousand years. The books were carried to the huts and\r\ncottages where the friars of Donegal lived round their ruined\r\nmonastery; from them the workers had food and attendance, while Fergal\r\nO'Gara, a petty chieftain of Sligo descended from Olioll, king of\r\nMunster in 260, gave them a reward for their labours. Another O'Clery\r\nwrote the story of Aedh Ruadh O'Donnell, his prisons and his battles,\r\nand the calamity to Ireland of his defeat. \"Then were lost besides\r\nnobility and honour, generosity and great deeds, hospitality and\r\ngoodness, courtesy and noble birth, polish and bravery, strength and\r\ncourage, valour and constancy, the authority and the sovereignty of\r\nthe Irish of Erin to the end of time.\"\r\n\r\nIn Galway a group of scholars laid, in Lynch's words, \"a secure\r\nanchorage\" for Irish history. Dr. John Lynch, the famous apologist of\r\nthe Irish, wrote there his historical defence of his people. To spread\r\nabroad their history he translated into Latin Keating's book. For the\r\nsame purpose his friend, Tuileagna O'Maelchonaire, a distinguished\r\nIrish scholar, translated the _Annals of Ulster_ into English.\r\nO'Flaherty of Moycullen in Galway, a man of great learning, wrote on\r\nIrish antiquities \"with exactness, diligence and judgment.\" \"I live,\"\r\nhe said, \"a banished man within the bounds of my native soil, a\r\nspectator of others enriched by my birthright, an object of condoling\r\nto my relations and friends, and a condoler of their miseries.\" His\r\nland confiscated (1641), stripped at last of his manuscripts as well\r\nas of his other goods, he died in miserable poverty in extreme old age\r\n(1709). To Galway came also Dualtach Mac Firbis (1585-1670), of a\r\nfamily that had been time out of mind hereditary historians in north\r\nConnacht. He learned in one of the old Irish schools of law in\r\nTipperary Latin, English, and Greek. Amid the horrors of Cromwell's\r\nwars he carried out a prodigious work on the genealogies of the clans,\r\nthe greatest, perhaps, that exists in any country; and wrote on their\r\nsaints, their kings, their writers, on the chronicles and on the laws;\r\nin moderate prosperity and in extreme adversity constantly devoted to\r\nthe preservation of Irish history. In his old age he lived, like other\r\nIrish scholars, a landless sojourner on the estates that had once\r\nbelonged to his family and race; the last of the hereditary sennachies\r\nof Ireland he wandered on foot from house to house, every Irish door\r\nopened to him for his learning after their undying custom, till at the\r\nage of eighty-five he was murdered by a Crofton when he was resting in\r\na house on his way to Dublin. In Connacht, too, lived Tadhg O'Roddy of\r\nLeitrim, a diligent collector of Irish manuscripts, who gathered\r\nthirty books of law, and many others of philosophy, poetry, physic,\r\ngenealogies, mathematics, romances, and history; and defended against\r\nthe English the character of the old law and civilisation of Ireland.\r\n\r\nIt would be long to tell of the workers in all the Irish\r\nprovinces--the lawyers hiding in their bosoms the genealogies and\r\ntenures of their clans--the scribes writing annals and genealogies,\r\nto be carried, perhaps, when Irishmen gathered as for a hurling-match\r\nand went out to one of their old places of assembly, there to settle\r\ntheir own matters by their ancient law. No printing-press could be set\r\nup among the Irish; they were driven back on oral tradition and\r\nlaborious copying by the pen. Thus for about a hundred years Keating's\r\n_History_ was passed from hand to hand after the old manner in copies\r\nmade by devoted Irish hands (one of them a \"farmer\"), in Leitrim,\r\nTipperary, Kildare, Clare, Limerick, Kilkenny, all over the country;\r\nit was only in 1723 that Dermot O'Conor translated it into English and\r\nprinted it in Dublin. It is amazing how amid the dangers of the time\r\nscribes should be found to re-write and re-edit the mass of\r\nmanuscripts, those that were lost and those that have escaped.\r\n\r\nThe poets were still the leaders of national patriotism. The great\r\n\"Contention of the Poets\"--\"Iomarbhagh na bhfiledh\"--a battle that\r\nlasted for years between the bards of the O'Briens and the O'Donnells,\r\nin which the bards of every part of Ireland joined--served to rouse\r\nthe pride of the Irish in their history amid their calamities under\r\nJames I. The leader of the argument, Tadhg Mac Daire, lord of an\r\nestate with a castle as chief poet of Thomond, was hurled over a cliff\r\nin his old age by a Cromwellian soldier with the shout, \"Say your rann\r\nnow, little man!\" Tadhg O'h'Uiginn of Sligo (+1617), Eochaidh\r\nO'h'Eoghasa of Fermanagh, were the greatest among very many. Bards\r\nwhose names have often been forgotten spread the poems of the Ossianic\r\ncycle, and wrote verses of several kinds into which a new gloom and\r\ndespair entered--\r\n\r\n    \"Though yesterday seemed to me long and ill,\r\n    Yet longer still was this dreary day.\"\r\n\r\nThe bards were still for a time trained in \"the schools\"--low thatched\r\nbuildings shut away by a sheltering wood, where students came for six\r\nmonths of the year. None were admitted who could not read and write,\r\nand use a good memory; none but those who had come of a bardic tribe,\r\nand of a far district, lest they should be distracted by friends and\r\nrelations. The Scottish Gaels and the Irish were united as of old in\r\nthe new literature; Irish bards and harpers were as much at home in\r\nthe Highlands and in the Isles as in Ireland, and the poems of the\r\nIrish bards were as popular there as in Munster. Thus the unity of\r\nfeeling of the whole race was preserved and the bards still remained\r\nmen who belonged to their country rather than to a clan or territory.\r\nBut with the exile of the Irish chiefs, with the steady ruin of \"the\r\nschools,\" poets began to throw aside the old intricate metres and the\r\nold words no longer understood, and turned to the people, putting away\r\n\"dark difficult language\" to bring literature to the common folk:\r\nthere were even translations made for those who were setting their\r\nchildren to learn the English instead of their native tongue. Born of\r\nan untold suffering, a burst of melody swept over Ireland, scores and\r\nscores of new and brilliant metres, perhaps the richest attempt to\r\nconvey music in words ever made by man. In that unfathomed experience,\r\nthey tell how seeking after Erin over all obstacles, they found her\r\nfettered and weeping, and for their loyalty she gave them the last\r\ngift left to her, the light of poetry.\r\n\r\nIn Leinster of the English, \"the cemetery of the valorous Gael,\" Irish\r\nlearning had a different story. There it seemed for a moment that it\r\nmight form a meeting-point between the new race and the old, joining\r\ntogether, as the Catholics put it, \"our commonwealth men,\" a people\r\ncompounded of many nations, some Irish by birth and descent, others by\r\ndescent only, others neither by descent nor by birth but by\r\ninhabitation of one soil; but all parts of one body politic,\r\nacknowledging one God, conjoined together in allegiance to one and the\r\nsame sovereign, united in the fruition of the selfsame air, and tied\r\nin subsistence upon this our natural soil whereupon we live together.\r\n\r\nA tiny group of scholars in Dublin had begun to study Irish history.\r\nSir James Ware (1594-1666), born there of an English family,\r\n\"conceived a great love for his native country and could not bear to\r\nsee it aspersed by some authors, which put him upon doing it all the\r\njustice he could in his writings.\" He spared no cost in buying\r\nvaluable manuscripts, kept an Irish secretary to translate, and\r\nemployed for eleven years the great scholar O'Flaherty whose help gave\r\nto his work its chief value. Ussher, archbishop of Armagh, also born\r\nin Dublin, devoted himself to the study of Irish antiquities. Baron\r\nd'Aungier, Master of the Rolls, put into writing every point which he\r\ncould find in original documents \"which for antiquity or singularity\r\nmight interest this country.\" The enthusiasm of learning drew together\r\nProtestant and Catholic, Anglo-Irish and Irish. All these men were in\r\ncommunication with Luke Wadding in Rome through Thomas Strange the\r\nFranciscan, his intimate friend; they sent their own collections of\r\nrecords to help him in his Catholic history of Irish saints, \"being\r\ndesirous that Wadding's book should see the light,\" wishing \"to help\r\nhim in his work for Ireland,\" begging to see \"the veriest trifle\" that\r\nhe wrote. The noblest English scholar was Bishop Bedell, who while\r\nprovost established an Irish lecture in Trinity College, had the\r\nchapter during commons read in Irish, and employed a Sheridan of Cavan\r\nto translate the Old Testament into Irish. As bishop he braved the\r\nanger of the government by declaring the hardships of the Catholic\r\nIrish, and by circulating a catechism in English and Irish. Bitterly\r\ndid Ussher reproach him for such a scandal at which the professors of\r\nthe gospel did all take offence, and for daring to adventure that\r\nwhich his brethren had been \"so long abuilding,\" the destruction of\r\nthe Irish language. The Irish alone poured out their love and\r\ngratitude to Bedell; they protected him in the war of 1641; the\r\ninsurgent chieftains fired volleys over his grave paying homage to his\r\npiety; \"sit anima mea cum Bedello!\" cried a priest. He showed what one\r\njust man, caring for the people and speaking to them in their own\r\ntongue, could do in a few years to abolish the divisions of race and\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nThe light, however, that had risen in Dublin was extinguished.\r\nSympathies for the spirit of Irishmen in their long history were\r\nquenched by the greed for land, the passion of commerce, and the\r\nfanaticism of ascendancy and dominion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nRULE OF THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\n1640-1750\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aim which English kings had set before them for the last four\r\nhundred years seemed now fulfilled. The land was theirs, and the\r\ndominion. But the victory turned to dust and ashes in their hands. The\r\n\"royal inheritance\" of so many hopes had practically disappeared; for\r\nif the feudal system which was to give the king the land of Ireland\r\nhad destroyed the tribal system, it was itself dead; decaying and\r\nintolerable in England, it could no longer be made to serve in\r\nIreland. Henry's dream of a royal army from Ireland, \"a sword and\r\nflay\" at the king's use against his subjects in Great Britain,\r\nperished; Charles I did indeed propose to use the Irish fighting-men\r\nto smite into obedience England and Scotland, but no king of England\r\ntried that experiment again. James II looked to Ireland, as in\r\nHenry's scheme, for a safe place of refuge to fly to in danger; that,\r\nagain, no king of England tried a second time. As for the king's\r\nrevenues and profits, the dream of so many centuries, that too\r\nvanished: confiscations old and new which the English parliament\r\nallowed the Crown for Irish government left the king none the richer,\r\nand after 1692 no longer sufficed even for Irish expenses. The title\r\nof \"King of Ireland\" which Henry VIII had proclaimed in his own right\r\nwith such high hopes, bred out of its original deception other\r\ndeceptions deeper and blacker than the first. The sovereign saw his\r\nabsolute tyranny gradually taken out of his hands by the parliament\r\nand middle class for their own benefit; the rule of the king was\r\npassing, the rule of the English parliament had begun.\r\n\r\nThus past history was as it were wiped out. Everything in Ireland was\r\nto be new. The social order was now neither feudal nor tribal, nor\r\nanything known before. Other methods had been set up, without custom,\r\ntradition, or law behind them. There were two new classes, English\r\nplanters and Irish toilers. No old ties bound them, and no new\r\ncharities. \"From the Anglo-Irish no man of special sanctity as yet is\r\nknown to have sprung,\" observed a Gael of that day. Ancient patrimony\r\nhad fallen. The new aristocracy was that of the strong hand and the\r\nexploiter's greed. Ordinary restraints of civilised societies were not\r\nyet born in this pushing commercial throng, where the scum of Great\r\nBritain, broken men or men flying from the law, hastened--\"hoping to\r\nbe without fear of man's justice in a land where there was nothing, or\r\nbut little as yet, of the fear of God.\" Ireland was left absolutely\r\nwithout guides or representatives. There were no natural leaders of\r\nthe country among the new men, each fighting for his own hand; the\r\nEnglish government permitted none among the Irish.\r\n\r\nEngland too was being made new, with much turmoil and confusion--an\r\nEngland where kings were yielding to parliaments, and parliaments were\r\nbeing subdued to the rising commercial classes. The idea of a separate\r\nroyal power and profit had disappeared and instead of it had come the\r\nrule and profit of the parliament of England, and of her noble-men,\r\necclesiastics, and traders in general.\r\n\r\nThis new rule marked the first revolution in the English government of\r\nIreland which had happened since Henry II sat in his Dublin palace. By\r\nthe ancient constitution assured by compacts and grants since English\r\nlaws were first brought into that country, Ireland was united to the\r\nCrown of England as a free and distinct kingdom, with the right of\r\nholding parliaments subject only to the king and his privy council;\r\nstatutes of the English parliament had not force of law there until\r\nthey had been re-enacted in Ireland--which indeed was necessary by the\r\nvery theory of parliaments, for there were no Irish representatives in\r\nthe English Houses. Of its mere will the parliament of England now\r\ntook to itself authority to make laws for Ireland in as free and\r\nuncontrolled a manner as if no Irish parliament existed. The new\r\nruling classes had neither experience nor training. Regardless of any\r\nlegal technicalities they simply usurped a power unlimited and\r\ndespotic over a confused and shattered Ireland. Now was seen the full\r\nevil of government from over-sea, where before a foreign tribunal,\r\nsitting at a distance, ignorant and prejudiced, the subject people had\r\nno voice; they could dispute no lie, and could affirm no truth.\r\n\r\nThis despotism grew up regardless of any theory of law or\r\nconstitution. The intention was unchanged--the taking of all Irish\r\nland, the rooting out of the old race from the country. Adventurers\r\nwere tempted by Irish wealth; what had once been widely diffused among\r\nthe Irish tribes was gathered into the hands of a few aliens, who\r\nruthlessly wasted the land for their own great enrichment. Enormous\r\nprofits fell to planters, who could get three times as much gain from\r\nan Irish as from an English estate by a fierce exploiting of the\r\nnatural resources of the island and of its cheap outlawed labour.\r\nForests of oak were hastily destroyed for quick profits; woods were\r\ncut down for charcoal to smelt the iron which was carried down the\r\nrivers in cunning Irish boats, and what had cost L10 in labour and\r\ntransport sold at L17 in London. The last furnace was put out in Kerry\r\nwhen the last wood had been destroyed. Where the English adventurer\r\npassed he left the land as naked as if a forest fire had swept over\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nFor the exploiter's rage, for the waster's madness, more land was\r\nconstantly needed. Three provinces had been largely planted by\r\n1620--one still remained. By a prodigious fraud James I, and after him\r\nCharles I in violation of his solemn promise, proposed to extirpate\r\nthe Irish from Connacht. The maddened people were driven to arms in\r\n1641. The London parliament which had just opened the quarrel with the\r\nking which was to end in his beheading, seized their opportunity in\r\nIreland. Instantly London City, and a House of Commons consisting\r\nmainly of Puritan adventurers, joined in speculations to buy up\r\n\"traitors' lands,\" openly sold in London at L100 for a thousand acres\r\nin Ulster or for six hundred in Munster, and so on in every province.\r\nIt was a cheap bargain, the value of forfeited lands being calculated\r\nby parliament later at L2,500 for a thousand acres. The more rebels\r\nthe more forfeitures, and every device of law and fraud was used to\r\nfling the whole people into the war, either in fact or in name, and so\r\ndestroy the claim of the whole of them to their lands. \"Wild\r\nIrishmen,\" the English said to one another, \"had nothing but the human\r\nform to show that they were men.\" Letters were forged and printed in\r\nEngland, purporting to give Irish news; discountenanced by parliament,\r\nthey still mark the first experiment to appeal in this way to London\r\non the Irish question. Parliament did its utmost to make the contest a\r\nwar of extermination: it ended, in fact, in the death of little less\r\nthan half the population.\r\n\r\nThe Commons' auction of Irishmen's lands in 1641, their conduct of a\r\nwar of distinguished ferocity, these were the acts by which the Irish\r\nfirst knew government by an English parliament. The memory of the\r\nblack curse of Cromwell lives among the people. He remains in Ireland\r\nas the great exemplar of inhuman cruelties, standing amid these scenes\r\nof woe with praises to God for such manifest evidence of His\r\ninspiration. The speculators got their lands, outcast women and\r\nchildren lay on the wayside devoured by wolves and birds of prey. By\r\norder of parliament (1653) over 20,000 destitute men, women, and\r\nchildren from twelve years were sold into the service of English\r\nplanters in Virginia and the Carolinas. Slave-dealers were let loose\r\nover the country, and the Bristol merchants did good business. With\r\nwhat bitter irony an Irishman might contrast the \"civilisation\" of the\r\nEnglish and the \"barbarism\" of the Irish--if we talk, he said, about\r\ncivility and a civil manner of contract of selling and buying, there\r\nis no doubt that the Anglo-Irish born in cities have had more\r\nopportunity to acquire civility than the Old Irish; but if the\r\nquestion be of civility, of good manners, of liberality, of\r\nhospitality, and charity towards all, these virtues dwelt among the\r\nIrish.\r\n\r\nKings were restored to carry out the will of parliament. Charles II at\r\ntheir bidding ignored the treaty of his father that the Irish who\r\nsubmitted should return to their lands (1661): at the mere appearance\r\nof keeping promise to a few hundred Catholic landowners out of\r\nthousands, the Protestant planters sent out their threats of\r\ninsurrection. A deeper misery was reached when William III led his\r\narmy across the Boyne and the Shannon (1690). In grave danger and\r\ndifficulty he was glad to win peace by the Treaty of Limerick, in\r\nwhich the Irish were promised the quiet exercise of their religion.\r\nThe Treaty was immediately broken. The English parliament objected to\r\nany such encouragement of Irish Papists, and demanded that no pardons\r\nshould be given or estates divided save by their advice, and William\r\nsaid no word to uphold the public faith. The pledge of freedom of\r\nworship was exchanged for the most infamous set of penal laws ever\r\nplaced on a Statute-book.\r\n\r\nThe breaking of the Treaty of Limerick, conspicuous among the\r\nperfidies to Ireland, inaugurated the century of settled rule by the\r\nparliament of England (1691-1782). Its first care was to secure to\r\nEnglish Protestants their revenues in Ireland; the planters,\r\none-fourth of the people of Ireland, were established as owners of\r\nfour-fifths of Irish soil; and one-half of their estates, the land\r\nconfiscated under Cromwell and William, they held by the despotic\r\ngrant of the English parliament. This body, having outlawed four\r\nthousand Irishmen, and seized a million and a half of their acres,\r\nproceeded to crush the liberties of its own English settlers by\r\nsimply issuing statutes for Ireland of its sole authority. The acts\r\nwere as tyrannical in their subject as in their origin. One (1691),\r\nwhich ordered that no Catholic should sit in the Irish Houses,\r\ndeprived three-fourths of the people of representatives, and left to\r\none-fourth alone the right of citizens. Some English judges decided,\r\nwithout and against Irish legal opinion, that the privy councils in\r\nDublin and London had power to alter Irish bills before sending them\r\nto the king. \"If an angel came from heaven that was a privy councillor\r\nI would not trust my liberty with him one moment,\" said an English\r\nmember of that time.\r\n\r\nAll liberties were thus rooted out. The planters' rights were\r\noverthrown as pitilessly as those of the Irish they had expelled.\r\nMolyneux, member for Dublin university, set forth in 1698 the \"Case of\r\nIreland.\" He traced its constitution for five centuries; showed that\r\nhistorically there had never been a \"conquest\" of Ireland, and that\r\nall its civil liberties were grounded on compact and charter; and\r\ndeclared that his native land shared the claims of all mankind to\r\njustice. \"To tax me without consent is little better, if at all, than\r\ndownright robbing me. I am sure the great patriots of liberty and\r\nproperty, the free people of England, cannot think of such a thing but\r\nwith abhorrence.\" \"There may be ill consequences,\" he cried, \"if the\r\nIrish come to think their rights and liberties were taken away, their\r\nparliaments rendered nugatory, and their lives and fortunes left to\r\ndepend on the will of a legislature wherein they are not parties.\" The\r\n\"ill consequences\" were seen seventy years later when Molyneux' book\r\nbecame the text-book of Americans in their rising against English\r\nrule; and when Anglo-Irish defenders of their own liberties were\r\ndriven to make common cause with their Irish compatriots--for \"no one\r\nor more men,\" said Molyneux, \"can by nature challenge any right,\r\nliberty, or freedom, or any ease in his property, estate, or\r\nconscience which all other men have not an equally just claim to.\" But\r\nthat day was far off. For the moment the Irish parliament deserved and\r\nreceived entire contempt from England. The gentry who had accepted\r\nland and power by the arbitrary will of the English House of Commons\r\ndared not dispute the tyranny that was the warrant of their property:\r\n\"I hope,\" was the ironic answer, \"the honourable member will not\r\nquestion the validity of his title.\" With such an argument at hand,\r\nthe English parliament had no need of circumspection or of soft words.\r\nIt simply condemned Molyneux and his remonstrance, demanded of the\r\nking to maintain the subordination of Ireland, and to order the\r\njournals of its parliaments to be laid before the Houses at\r\nWestminster; and on the same day required of him, since the Irish were\r\n\"dependent on and protected by England in the enjoyment of all they\r\nhad,\" to forbid them to continue their woollen trade, but leave it\r\nentire to England. In 1719 it declared its power at all times to make\r\nlaws which should bind the people of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThus an English parliament which had fought for its own liberties\r\nestablished a hierarchy of tyranny for Ireland: the Anglo-Irish tied\r\nunder servitude to England, and the Irish chained under an equal\r\nbondage to the Anglo-Irish. As one of the governors of Ireland wrote a\r\nhundred years later, \"I think Great Britain may still easily manage\r\nthe Protestants, and the Protestants the Catholics.\" Such was the\r\nservile position of English planters. They had made their bargain. To\r\npay the price of wealth and ascendency they sold their own freedom and\r\nthe rights of their new country. The smaller number, said Burke, were\r\nplaced in power at the expense of the civil liberties and properties\r\nof the far greater, and at the expense of the civil liberties of the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nIreland was now degraded to a subject colony. The government never\r\nproposed that Englishmen in Ireland should be on equal terms with\r\nEnglish in England. Stringent arrangements were made to keep Ireland\r\nlow. The Habeas Corpus Act was suspended while the English parliament\r\nruled. Judges were removable at pleasure. Precautions were taken\r\nagainst the growth of \"an Irish interest.\" By a variety of devices the\r\nparliament of English Protestants was debased to a corrupt and ignoble\r\nservitude. So deep was their subjection that Ireland was held in\r\nEngland to be \"no more than a remote part of their dominion, which was\r\nnot accustomed to figure on the theatre of politics.\" Government by\r\nDublin Castle was directed in the sole interest of England; the\r\ngreatest posts in the Castle, the Law, the Church, were given to\r\nEnglishmen, \"king-fishers,\" as the nickname went of the churchmen. \"I\r\nfear much blame here,\" said the English premier in 1774, \"...if I\r\nconsent to part with the disposal of these offices which have been so\r\nlong and so uniformly bestowed upon members of the British\r\nparliament.\" Castle officials were expected to have a single view to\r\nEnglish interests. In speeches from the throne governors of Ireland\r\nformally spoke of the Irish people, the majority of their subjects, as\r\n\"the common enemy\"; they were scarcely less suspicious of the English\r\nProtestants; \"it is worth turning in your mind,\" one wrote to Pitt,\r\n\"how the violence of both parties might be turned on this occasion to\r\nthe advancement of England.\"\r\n\r\nOne tyranny begot another. Irish members, having no liberties to\r\ndefend, and no country to protect, devoted themselves to the security\r\nof their property--its security and increase. All was quiet. There was\r\nno fear in Ireland of a rising for the Pretender. The Irish, true to\r\ntheir ancient horror of violence for religion, never made a religious\r\nwar, and never desired that which was ever repugnant to the Irish\r\nspirit, temporal ascendency for a spiritual faith. Their only prayer\r\nwas for freedom in worship--that same prayer which Irish Catholics had\r\npresented in the parliament of James I (1613), \"indented with sorrow,\r\nsigned with tears, and delivered in this house of peace and liberty\r\nwith our disarmed hands.\" Protestants had never cause for fear in\r\nIreland on religious grounds. In queen Mary's persecution Protestants\r\nflying from England had taken shelter in Ireland among Irish\r\nCatholics, and not a hand was raised against them there. Bitter as\r\nwere the poets against the English exterminators, no Irish curse has\r\nbeen found against the Protestant for his religion, even through the\r\nblack time of the penal laws. The parliament, however, began a series\r\nof penal laws against Irish Catholics. They were forbidden the use of\r\ntheir religion, almost every means of livelihood, every right of a\r\ncitizen, every family affection. Their possessions were scattered,\r\neducation was denied them, when a father died his children were\r\nhanded over to a Protestant guardian. \"The law,\" said the leading\r\njudges, \"does not suppose any such person to exist as an Irish Roman\r\nCatholic.\" They were only recognised \"for repression and punishment.\"\r\nStatutes framed to demoralise and debase the people, so as to make\r\nthem for ever unfit for self-government, pursued the souls of the\r\nvictims to the second and third generation. In this ferocious violence\r\nthe law-makers were not moved by fanaticism. Their rapacity was not\r\nconcerned with the religion of the Irish, but only with their property\r\nand industry. The conversion of a Catholic was not greatly desired; so\r\nlong as there were Papists the planters could secure their lands, and\r\nuse them as slaves, \"worse than negroes.\" Laws which would have\r\nsounded infamous if directed openly to the seizing of property, took\r\non a sacred character as a religious effort to suppress false\r\ndoctrine. One-fiftieth part of Ireland was all that was left to Irish\r\nCatholics, utterly excluded for ever from the inheritance of their\r\nfathers. \"One single foot of land there is not left us,\" rose their\r\nlament, \"no, not what one may make his bed upon.\" \"See all that are\r\nwithout a bed except the furze of the mountains, the bent of the\r\ncurragh, and the bog-myrtle beneath their bodies. Under frost, under\r\nsnow, under rain, under blasts of wind, without a morsel to eat but\r\nwatercress, green grass, sorrel of the mountain, or clover of the\r\nhills. Och! my pity to see their nobles forsaken!\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet, in spite of this success, the Anglo-Irish had made a bad\r\nbargain. Cut off from their fellow-countrymen, having renounced the\r\nright to have a country, the Protestant land-hunters were no more\r\nrespected in England than in Ireland. The English parliament did with\r\nthem as it chose. Their subjection tempted the commercial classes. To\r\nsafeguard their own profits of commerce and industry English traders\r\nmade statutes to annihilate Irish competition. They forbade carrying\r\nof cattle or dairy stuff to England, they forbade trade in soap or\r\ncandles; in cloth, in glass, in linen save of the coarsest kind; the\r\nincrease of corn was checked; it was proposed to stop Irish fisheries.\r\nThe wool which they might not use at home must be exported to England\r\nalone. They might not build ships. From old time Ireland had traded\r\nacross the Gaulish sea: her ports had seen the first discoverers of\r\nAmerica. But now all her great harbours to the west with its rising\r\nAmerican trade were closed: no merchant ship crossing the Atlantic was\r\nallowed to load at an Irish port or to unload. The abundance of\r\nharbours, once so full of commerce, were now, said Swift, \"of no more\r\nuse to us than a beautiful prospect to a man shut up in a dungeon.\" In\r\n1720 all trade was at a stand, the country bare of money, \"want and\r\nmisery in every face.\" It was unfortunate, Englishmen said, that\r\nIreland had been by the act of God doomed to poverty--so isolated in\r\ngeographical position, so lacking in industrial resources, inhabited\r\nby a people so indolent in tillage, and unfitted by their religion to\r\nwork. Meanwhile they successfully pushed their own business in a\r\ncountry which they allowed to make nothing for itself. Their\r\nmanufacturers sent over yearly two millions of their goods, more than\r\nto any other country save their American colonies, and took the raw\r\nmaterial of Ireland, while Irish workers were driven out on the\r\nhillsides to starve. The planters' parliament looked on in barren\r\nhelplessness. They had no nation behind them. They could lead no\r\npopular resistance. They had no call to public duty. And the English\r\nknew it well. Ministers heaped up humiliations; they quartered on\r\nIrish revenues all the pensioners that could not safely be proposed to\r\na free parliament in England--the mistresses of successive kings and\r\ntheir children, German relations of the Hanoverians, useful\r\npoliticians covered by other names, a queen of Denmark banished for\r\nmisconduct, a Sardinian ambassador under a false title, a trailing\r\nhost of Englishmen--pensions steadily increasing from L30,000 to over\r\nL89,000. Some L600,000 was at last yearly sent over to England for\r\nabsentees, pensions, government annuities, and the like. A parliament\r\nservile and tyrannical could not even pretend to urge on the\r\ngovernment that its measures, as a patriot said, should sometimes\r\n\"diverge towards public utility.\" It had abandoned all power save that\r\nof increasing the sorrows of the people.\r\n\r\nA double corruption was thus proceeding. The English parliament\r\ndesired to make the Irish houses for ever unfit for self-government.\r\nThe Irish parliament was seeking to perform the same office for the\r\nIrish people under it. The old race meanwhile, three-fourths of the\r\ndwellers in Ireland, were brought under consideration of the rulers\r\nonly as objects of some new rigour or severity. Their cry was unheard\r\nby an absent and indifferent \"conqueror,\" and the only reform the\r\ncountry ever knew was an increase in the army that maintained the\r\nalien rulers and protected their crimes. In neither parliament had the\r\nIrish any voice. In courts where the law was administered by\r\nProtestant landlords and their agents, as magistrates, grand juries,\r\nbailiffs, lawyers, and the rest--\"full of might and injustice, without\r\na word for the Irish in the law,\" as an Irish poem said, who would not\r\neven write the Irish names, but scornfully cried after all of them\r\nTeig and Diarmuid--the ancient tongue of the people and their despised\r\nbirth left them helpless. Once a chief justice in Tipperary conducted\r\ntrials with fairness and humanity: \"for about ten miles from Clonmel\r\nboth sides of the road were lined with men, women, and children, who,\r\nas he passed along, kneeled down and supplicated Heaven to bless him\r\nas their protector and guardian angel.\" The people poured from \"this\r\nsod of misery\" across the sea. In the service of France alone 450,000\r\nIrish soldiers were reckoned to have died between 1691 and 1745.\r\nUncounted thousands from north and south sailed to America. Irish\r\nCatholics went there in a constant stream from 1650 till 1798. The\r\nProtestant settlers followed them in the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nLike the kings of England, the parliament of the English aristocracy\r\nand commercial magnates had failed to exploit Ireland to their\r\nadvantage. For a hundred years (1691-1782) they ruled the Irish people\r\nwith the strictest severity that human ingenuity could devise. A\r\n\"strong government,\" purely English, was given its opportunity--prolonged,\r\nundisturbed, uncontrolled--to advance \"the king's service,\" the\r\ndependency of Ireland upon England, and \"the comfort or security of any\r\nEnglish in it.\" A multitude of statesmen put their hands to the work.\r\nCommercial men in England inspired the policy. English clergy were sent\r\nover to fill all the higher posts of the church, and were the chief\r\nleaders of the secular government. Such a power very rarely falls to\r\nthe rulers in any country. And in the end there was no advantage to any\r\nparty. Some astute individuals heaped up an ignoble wealth, but there\r\nwas no profit to Ireland, to England, or to the Empire. The Irish\r\npeople suffered a long agony unmatched, perhaps, in European history.\r\nFew of the Protestant country gentry had established their fortunes;\r\ntheir subservience which debarred them from public duty, their\r\nprivilege of calling in English soldiers to protect them from the\r\nresults of every error or crime, had robbed them of any high\r\nintelligence in politics or science in their business of land\r\nmanagement, and thus doubly impoverished them. England on her part had\r\nthrown into the sea from her dominion a greater wealth of talent,\r\nindustry, and bravery than had ever been exiled from any country in the\r\nworld: there was not a country in Europe, and not an occupation, where\r\nIrishmen were not in the first rank--as field-marshals, admirals,\r\nambassadors, prime ministers, scholars, physicians, merchants, founders\r\nof mining industries, soldiers, and labourers. In exchange for this an\r\nincompetent and inferior landed gentry was established in Ireland.\r\nInstead of profit for the government there was plain bankruptcy--\"England,\"\r\nit was said, \"must now either support this kingdom, or allow her the\r\nmeans of supporting herself.\" As for the Empire, the colonies had been\r\nflooded with the men that England had wronged. Even the Protestant\r\nexiles from Ulster went to America as \"Sons of St. Patrick.\" \"To shun\r\npersecution and designed ruin\" by the English government, Protestants\r\nand Catholics had gone, and their money, their arms, the fury of their\r\nwrath, were spent in organising the American War. Irishmen were at\r\nevery meeting, every council, every battle. Their indignation was a\r\nwhite flame of revolt that consumed every fear and vacillation around\r\nit. That long, deep, and bitter experience bore down the temporisers,\r\nand sent out men trained in suffering to triumph over every adversity.\r\nBrigadier-General Owen Sullivan, born at Limerick during the siege, was\r\npublicly thanked by Washington and by the congress. Commodore John\r\nBarry, a Wexford man, \"Father of the American Navy,\" was Washington's\r\ncommander-in-chief of the naval forces of the States. Charles Thompson\r\nof Strabane was secretary of the Continental Congress. Eight Irishmen,\r\npassionate organisers of the revolt, signed the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. After the war an Irishman prepared the Declaration for\r\npublication from Jefferson's rough draft; an Irishman's son first\r\npublicly read it; an Irishman first printed and published it.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the uncontrolled rule of English kings and English\r\nParliaments. Such was the end of their story. There was another\r\nexperiment yet to be tried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF A NEW IRELAND\r\n\r\n1691-1750\r\n\r\n\r\nIt might have seemed impossible amid such complicated tyrannies to\r\nbuild up a united country. But the most ferocious laws could not\r\nwholly destroy the kindly influences of Ireland, the essential needs\r\nof men, nor the charities of human nature. There grew up too the union\r\nof common suffering. Once more the people of Ireland were being\r\n\"brayed together in a mortar\" to compact them into a single\r\ncommonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe Irish had never lost their power of absorbing new settlers in\r\ntheir country. The Cromwellians complained that thousands of the\r\nEnglish who came over under Elizabeth had \"become one with the Irish\r\nas well in affinity as in idolatry.\" Forty years later these\r\nCromwellians planted on Irish farms suffered themselves the same\r\nchange; their children could not speak a word of English and became\r\nwholly Irish in religion and feeling. Seven years after the battle of\r\nthe Boyne the same influence began to turn Irish the very soldiers of\r\nWilliam. The civilisation, the piety, the charm of Irish life told as\r\nof old. In the country places, far from the government, kindly\r\nfriendships grew up between neighbours, and Protestants by some device\r\nof goodwill would hide a Catholic from some atrocious penalty, would\r\nsave his arms from being confiscated, or his children from being\r\nbrought up as Protestants. The gentry in general spoke Irish with the\r\npeople, and common interests grew up in the land where they lived\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe Irish had seen the fires of destruction pass over them, consuming\r\nthe humanities of their law, the honour of their country, and the\r\nrelics of their fathers: the cry of their lamentation, said an Italian\r\nin 1641, was more expressive than any music he had heard of the great\r\nmasters of the continent. The penal days have left their traces. We\r\nmay still see in hidden places of the woods some cave or rock where\r\nthe people gathered in secret to celebrate mass. There remain\r\nmemorials of Irishmen, cast out of their lands, who to mark their\r\nfinal degradation had been driven to the livelihood which the new\r\nEnglish held in the utmost contempt--the work of their hands; their\r\ndead bodies were carried to the ruined abbeys, and proudly laid in the\r\nroofless naves and chancels, under great sculptured slabs bearing the\r\nnames of once noble families, and deeply carved with the instruments\r\nof the dead man's trade, a plough, the tools of a shoemaker or a\r\ncarpenter or a mason. In a far church in Connemara by the Atlantic, a\r\nBurke raised in 1722 a sculptured tomb to the first of his race who\r\nhad come to Connacht, the figure in coat of mail and conical helmet\r\nfinely carved in limestone. Monuments lie heaped in Burris, looking\r\nout on the great ocean; and in all the sacred places of the Irish. By\r\ntheir industry and skill in the despised business of handicrafts and\r\ncommerce the outlaws were fast winning most of the ready money of the\r\ncountry into their hands.\r\n\r\nIt would be a noble achievement, said Swift, to abolish the Irish\r\nlanguage, which prevented \"the Irish from being tamed.\" But Swift's\r\npopularity with the native Irish was remarkable, and when he visited\r\nCavan he was interested by verses of its poets and wrote an English\r\nballad founded on the Plearaca Ui Ruairc; he helped the rector of Anna\r\n(Belturbet) in his endeavours to have prayers read in Irish in the\r\nestablished churches in remote places. The Protestant bishops and\r\nclergy in general, holding that their first duty was not to minister\r\nto the souls of Irishmen, but rather as agents of the government to\r\nbring Irish speech \"into entire disuse,\" refused to learn the only\r\nlanguage understood by the people. Clergy and officials alike knew\r\nnothing whatever of the true life of Ireland. Now and then there was a\r\nrare exception, and the respect which Philip Skelton showed for the\r\nreligious convictions of a country-bred maidservant should be\r\nremembered. But in general the clergy and all other political agents\r\nopposed kindly intercourse of the two races. The fiction of complete\r\nIrish barbarism was necessary to maintain the Protestant ascendency,\r\nand in later days to defend it. The whole literature of the Irish was\r\ntherefore cast aside as waste refuse. Their race is never mentioned in\r\nhistories of the eighteenth century save as an indistinct and obscure\r\nmass of wretchedness, lawlessness, and ignorance, lying in\r\nimpenetrable darkness, whence no voice ever arose even of protest or\r\ncomplaint, unless the pains of starvation now and again woke the most\r\nmiserable from their torpor to some wild outrage, to be repressed by\r\neven more savage severity. So fixed and convenient did this lying\r\ndoctrine prove that it became a truism never challenged. To this day\r\nall manuscripts of the later Irish times have been rejected from\r\npurchase by public funds, to the irrevocable loss of a vast mass of\r\nIrish material. By steadily neglecting everything written in the\r\nnative tongue of the country, the Protestant planters, one-fourth of\r\nthe inhabitants, secured to themselves the sole place in the later\r\nhistory of Ireland. A false history engendered a false policy, which\r\nin the long run held no profit for the Empire, England, or Ireland.\r\n\r\nUnsuspected by English settlers, the Irish tradition was carried\r\nacross the years of captivity by these exiles in their own land.\r\nDescendants of literary clans, historians and poets and scribes were\r\nto be found in farmhouses, working at the plough and spade. Some wrote\r\nprose accounts of the late wars, the history of their tribe, the\r\nantiquities of their province, annals of Ireland, and geography. The\r\ngreatest of the poets was Daibhi O'Bruadair of Limerick, a man knowing\r\nsome English and learned in Irish lore, whose poems (1650-1694)\r\nstirred men of the cabins with lessons of their time, the laying down\r\nof arms by the Irish in 1652, Sarsfield and Limerick, the breaking of\r\nthe treaty, the grandsons of kings working with the spade, the poor\r\nman perfected in learning, steadfast, well proved in good sense, the\r\nchaffering insolence of the new traders, the fashion of men fettering\r\ntheir tongues to speak the mere ghost of rough English, or turning\r\nProtestant for ease. Learned men showed the love of their language in\r\nthe making of dictionaries and grammars to preserve, now that the\r\ngreat schools were broken up, the learning of the great masters of\r\nIrish. Thus the poet Tadhg O'Neachtain worked from 1734 to 1749 at a\r\ndictionary. Another learned poet and lexicographer, Aodh Buidh\r\nMacCurtin, published with Conor O'Begly in Paris a grammar (1728) and\r\na dictionary (1732); in his last edition of the grammar he prayed\r\npardon for \"confounding an example of the imperative with the\r\npotential mood,\" which he was caused to do \"by the great bother of the\r\nbrawling company that is round about me in this prison.\" There were\r\nstill well-qualified scribes who copied the old heroic stories and\r\ncirculated them freely all over Ireland. There were some who\r\ntranslated religious books from French and Latin into Irish. \"I wish\r\nto save,\" said Charles O'Conor, \"as many as I can of the ancient\r\nmanuscripts of Ireland from the wreck which has overwhelmed everything\r\nthat once belonged to us.\" O'Conor was of Sligo county. His father,\r\nlike other gentlemen, had been so reduced by confiscation that he had\r\nto plough with his own hands. A Franciscan sheltered in a peasant's\r\ncottage, who knew no English, taught him Latin. He attended mass held\r\nsecretly in a cave. Amid such difficulties he gained the best\r\nlearning of his unhappy time. Much of the materials that O'Clery had\r\nused for his _Annals_ had perished in the great troubles, and O'Conor\r\nbegan again that endless labour of Irish scholars, the saving of the\r\nrelics of his people's story from final oblivion. It was the passion\r\nof his life. He formed an Irish library, and copied with his own hand\r\nlarge volumes of extracts from books he could not possess. Having\r\nobtained O'Clery's own manuscript of the _Annals_, he had this immense\r\nwork copied by his own scribe; and another copy made in 1734 by Hugh\r\nO'Mulloy, an excellent writer, for his friend Dr. O'Fergus of Dublin.\r\nHe wrote for the learned, and delighted the peasants round him with\r\nthe stories of their national history. It is interesting to recall\r\nthat Goldsmith probably knew O'Conor, so that the best English of an\r\nIrishman, and the best learning of an Irishman at that time, were thus\r\nconnected.\r\n\r\nIt was the Irish antiquarians and historians who in 1759 drew Irishmen\r\ntogether into \"the Catholic Committee\"--Charles O'Conor, Dr. Curry,\r\nand Wyse of Waterford. O'Conor by his learning preserved for them the\r\nhistory of their fathers. Dr. Curry, of a Cavan family whose estates\r\nhad been swept from them in 1641 and 1691, had studied as a physician\r\nin France, and was eminent in Dublin though shut out from every post;\r\nhe was the first to use his research and literary powers to bring\r\ntruth out of falsehood in the later Irish history, and to justify the\r\nIrish against the lying accusations concerning the rising of 1641.\r\nThese learned patriots combined in a movement to win for the Irish\r\nsome recognition before the law and some rights of citizens in their\r\nown land.\r\n\r\nCountless poets, meanwhile, poured out in verse the infinite sorrow of\r\nthe Gaels, recalling the days when their land was filled with\r\npoet-schools and festivals, and the high hospitality of great\r\nIrishmen. If a song of hope arose that the race should come to their\r\nown again, the voice of Irish charity was not wanting--\"Having the\r\nfear of God, be ye full of alms-giving and friendliness, and\r\nforgetting nothing do ye according to the commandments, shun ye\r\ndrunkenness and oaths and cursing, and do not say till death 'God\r\ndamn' from your mouths.\" Riotous laughter broke out in some; they\r\nwere all, in fact, professional wits--chief among them Eoghan Ruadh\r\nO'Sullivan from Kerry, who died in 1784; a working man who had\r\nlaboured with plough and spade, and first came into note for helping\r\nhis employer's son, fresh from a French college, with an explanation\r\nof a Greek passage. Jacobite poems told of the Lady Erin as a\r\nbeautiful woman flying from the insults of foreign suitors in search\r\nof her real mate--poems of fancy, for the Stuarts had lost all hold on\r\nIreland. The spirit of the north rang out in a multitude of bards,\r\nwhose works perished in a century of persecution and destruction.\r\nAmong exiles in Connacht manuscripts perished, but old tradition lived\r\non the lips of the peasants, who recited in their cabins the\r\nlove-songs and religious poems of long centuries past. The people in\r\nthe bareness of their poverty were nourished with a literature full of\r\nwit, imagination, feeling, and dignity. In the poorest hovels there\r\nwere men skilled in a fine recitation. Their common language showed\r\nthe literary influence, and Irish peasants even in our own day have\r\nused a vocabulary of some five thousand words, as against about eight\r\nhundred words used by peasants in England. Even the village dancing at\r\nthe cross-roads preserved a fine and skilled tradition.\r\n\r\nFamilies, too, still tried to have \"a scholar\" in their house, for the\r\nold learning's sake. Children shut out from all means of education\r\nmight be seen learning their letters by copying with chalk the\r\ninscriptions on their fathers' tombstones. There were few candles, and\r\nthe scholar read his books by a cabin fire in the light given by\r\nthrowing upon it twigs and dried furze. Manuscripts were carefully\r\ntreasured, and in days when it was death or ruin to be found with an\r\nIrish book they were buried in the ground or hidden in the walls. In\r\nremote places schools were maintained out of the destitution of the\r\npoor; like that one which was kept up for over a hundred years in\r\ncounty Waterford, where the people of the surrounding districts\r\nsupported \"poor scholars\" free of charge. There were some in Kerry,\r\nsome in Clare, where a very remarkable group of poets sprang up. From\r\nall parts of Ireland students begged their way to \"the schools of\r\nMunster.\" Thus Greek and Latin still found their way into the\r\nlabourer's cottage. In county Cork, John Clairech O'Donnell, in\r\nremembrance of the ancient assemblies of the bards of all Ireland,\r\ngathered to his house poets and learned men to recite and contend as\r\nin the old days. Famous as a poet, he wrote part of a history of\r\nIreland, and projected a translation of Homer into Irish. But he\r\nworked in peril, flying for his life more than once before the\r\nbard-hunters; in his denunciations the English oppressor stands before\r\nus--plentiful his costly living in the high-gabled lighted-up mansion\r\nof the Irish Brian, but tight-closed his door, and his churlishness\r\nshut up inside with him, there in an opening between two mountains,\r\nuntil famine clove to the people and bowed them to his will; his gate\r\nhe never opened to the moan of the starving, \"and oh! may heaven of\r\nthe saints be a red wilderness for James Dawson!\"\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm of the Irish touched some of the planters. A hereditary\r\nchronicler of the O'Briens who published in 1717 a vindication of the\r\nAntiquities of Ireland got two hundred and thirty-eight subscribers,\r\ndivided about equally between English and Gaelic names. Wandering\r\npoets sang, as Irish poets had done nine hundred years before, even in\r\nthe houses of the strangers, and found in some of them a kindly\r\nfriend. O'Carolan, the harper and singer, was beloved by both races. A\r\nslight inequality in a village field in Meath still after a hundred\r\nand fifty years recalls to Irish peasants the site of the house where\r\nhe was born, and at his death English and Irish, Protestant and\r\nCatholic, gathered in an encampment of tents to do honour to his name.\r\nThe magic of Irish music seems even to have stirred in the landlords'\r\nparliament some dim sense of a national boast. An English nobleman\r\ncoming to the parliament with a Welsh harper claimed that in all\r\nIreland no such music could be heard. Mr. Jones of Leitrim took up the\r\nchallenge for an Irishman of his county who \"had never worn linen or\r\nwoollen.\" The Commons begged to have the trial in their House before\r\nbusiness began, and all assembled to greet the Leitrim champion.\r\nO'Duibhgeanain was of an old literary clan: one of them had shared in\r\nmaking the _Annals of the Four Masters_; he himself was not only a\r\nfine harper, but an excellent Greek and Latin scholar. He came, tall\r\nand handsome, looking very noble in his ancient garb made of beaten\r\nrushes, with a cloak or plaid of the same stuff, and a high conical\r\ncap of the same adorned with many tassels. And the House of Commons\r\ngave him their verdict.\r\n\r\nJames Murphy, a poor bricklayer of Cork, who became an architect and\r\nstudied Arabian antiquities in Portugal and Spain, gives the lament of\r\nIrish scholars. \"You accuse their pastors with illiterature, whilst\r\nyou adopt the most cruel means of making them ignorant; and their\r\npeasantry with untractableness, whilst you deprive them of the means\r\nof civilisation. But that is not all; you have deprived them at once\r\nof their religion, their liberty, their oak, and their harp, and left\r\nthem to deplore their fate, not in the strains of their ancestors, but\r\nin the sighs of oppression.\" To the great landlords the Act of 1691\r\nwhich had given them wealth was the dawn of Irish civilisation.\r\nOblivion might cover all the rest, all that was not theirs. They\r\nlived in a land some few years old, not more than a man's age might\r\ncover.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, however, dwellers in Ireland were forced into some concern\r\nfor its fortunes. Swift showed to the Protestants the wrongs they\r\nendured and the liberties which should be theirs, and flung his scorn\r\non the shameful system of their slavery and their tyranny (1724). Lord\r\nMolesworth urged (1723) freedom of religion, schools of husbandry,\r\nrelief of the poor from their intolerable burdens, the making\r\nparliament into a really representative body. Bishop Berkeley wrote\r\nhis famous _Querist_--the most searching study of the people's grief\r\nand its remedies.\r\n\r\nGradually the people of Ireland were being drawn together. All classes\r\nsuffered under the laws to abolish Irish trade and industry. Human\r\ncharities were strong in men of both sides, and in the country there\r\nwas a growing movement to unite the more liberal of the landowners,\r\nthe Dissenters of the north, and the Catholics, in a common\r\ncitizenship. It had proved impossible to carry out fully the penal\r\ncode. No life could have gone on under its monstrous terms. There were\r\nnot Protestants enough to carry on all the business of the country\r\nand some \"Papists\" had to be taken at least into the humbler forms of\r\nofficial work. Friendly acts between neighbours diminished\r\npersecution.\r\n\r\n\"Let the legislature befriend us now, and we are theirs forever,\" was\r\nthe cry of the Munster peasantry, organised under O'Driscoll, to the\r\nProtestant parliament in 1786.\r\n\r\nSuch a movement alarmed the government extremely. If, they said,\r\nreligious distinctions were abolished, the Protestants would find\r\nthemselves secure of their position without British protection, and\r\nmight they not then form a government more to the taste and wishes of\r\nthe people--in fact, might not a nation begin again to live in\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nThe whole energy of the government was therefore called out to avert\r\nthe rise of a united Irish People.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nAN IRISH PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\n1750-1800\r\n\r\n\r\nThe movement of conciliation of its peoples that was shaping a new\r\nIreland, silent and unrecorded as it was, can only be understood by\r\nthe astonishing history of the next fifty years, when the spirit of a\r\nnation rose again triumphant, and lesser passions fell before the love\r\nof country.\r\n\r\nThe Protestant gentry, who alone had free entry into public life, were\r\nof necessity the chief actors in the recorded story. But in the\r\nawakening country they had to reckon with a rising power in the\r\nCatholic Irish. Dr. Lucas, who in 1741 had begun to stir for reform\r\nand freedom, had stirred not only the English settlers but the native\r\nIrish. Idolised by the Irish people, he raised in his _Citizens'\r\nJournal_ a new national protest. The pamphlet war which\r\nfollowed--where men argued not only on free trade and government, but\r\non Ireland itself, on its old and new races, on its Irish barbarism,\r\nsaid some, its Irish civilisation, said others--spread the idea of a\r\ncommon history of Ireland in which all its inhabitants were concerned.\r\nIn parliament too, though Catholics were shut out, yet men of old\r\nIrish race were to be found--men of Catholic families who had accepted\r\nProtestantism as a means of entering public life, chiefly by way of\r\nthe law. They had not, save very rarely, put off their patriotic\r\nardour with their old religion; of the middle class, they were braver\r\nin their outlook than the small and disheartened Catholic aristocracy.\r\nIf their numbers were few their ability was great, and behind them lay\r\nthat vast mass of their own people whose blood they shared.\r\n\r\nIt was an Irishman who first roused the House of Commons to remember\r\nthat they had a country of their own and an \"Irish interest\"--Antony\r\nMalone. This astonishing orator and parliamentarian invented a\r\npatriotic opposition (1753). A great sea in a \"storm\" men said of him.\r\nTerror was immediately excited at his Irish origin and his national\r\nfeeling. Dublin Castle feared that he might mean emancipation from the\r\nEnglish legislature, and in truth the constitutional dependency upon\r\nEngland was the object upon which Malone's eye was constantly fixed.\r\nHe raised again the protest of Molyneux for a free parliament and\r\nconstitution. He stirred \"the whole nation\" for \"the last struggle for\r\nIreland.\" They and their children would be slaves, he said, if they\r\nyielded to the claim of the government that the English privy council\r\ncould alter the money bills sent over by the Irish parliament, or that\r\nthe king had the right to apply at his will the surplus funds in the\r\ntreasury.\r\n\r\nMalone was defeated, but the battle had begun which in thirty years\r\nwas to give to Ireland her first hopes of freedom. A fresh current of\r\nthought poured through the House--free trade, free religion, a Habeas\r\nCorpus Act, fewer pensions for Englishmen, a share in law and\r\ngovernment for Irishmen, security for judges, and a parliament elected\r\nevery seven years. Successors of Malone appeared in the House of\r\nCommons in 1761--more lawyers, men said, than any one living could\r\nremember, or \"than appears in any history in this or any other kingdom\r\nupon earth.\" They depended, not on confiscation, but on their own\r\nabilities; they owed nothing to government, which gave all the great\r\nposts of the bar to Englishmen. Some freedom of soul was theirs, and\r\nmanhood for the long struggle. In 1765 the issue was clearly set. The\r\nEnglish House of Commons which had passed the Stamp Act for the\r\nAmerican colonies, argued that it had the right to tax Ireland without\r\nher consent; and English lawyers laid down the absolute power of\r\nparliament to bind Ireland by its laws. In Ireland Lord Charlemont and\r\nsome other peers declared that Ireland was a distinct kingdom, with\r\nits own legislature and executive under the king.\r\n\r\nIn that same year the patriots demanded that elections should be held\r\nevery seven years--the first step in Ireland towards a true\r\nrepresentation, and the first blow to the dominion of an aristocracy.\r\nThe English government dealt its counter-stroke. The viceroy was\r\nordered to reside in Dublin, and by making himself the source of all\r\nfavours, the giver of all gratifications, to concentrate political\r\ninfluence in the English Crown. A system of bribery began beyond all\r\nprevious dreams; peerages were made by the score; and the first\r\nnational debt of nearly two millions created in less than thirty\r\nyears. The landowners who controlled the seats in the Commons were\r\nreminded that \"they held by Great Britain everything most dear to\r\nthem, their religion, their pre-eminence, their property, their\r\npolitical power\"; that \"confiscation is their common title.\" \"The\r\nking's business,\" as the government understood it, lay in \"procuring\r\nthe supplies which the English minister thought fit to ask, and\r\npreventing the parliament from examining into the account of previous\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile misery deepened. In 1778 thirty thousand Irishmen were\r\nseeking their living on the continent, besides the vast numbers flying\r\nto America. \"The wretches that remained had scarcely the appearance of\r\nhuman creatures.\" English exports to Ireland sank by half-a-million,\r\nand England instead of receiving money had to send L50,000 for the\r\npayment of troops there. Other dangers had arisen. George Washington\r\nwas made commander-in-chief of the forces for the American war in\r\n1775, and in 1778 France recognised American independence. The shores\r\nof Ireland lay open to attack: the country was drained of troops.\r\nBands of volunteers were formed for its protection, Protestant troops\r\nled by landlords and gentry. In a year 40,000 volunteers were enrolled\r\n(1779). Ireland was no longer unarmed. What was even more important,\r\nshe was no longer unrepresented. A packed parliament that had obscured\r\nthe true desires of the country was silenced before the voice of the\r\npeople. In the sense of a common duty, landlord and tenant, Protestant\r\nand Catholic, were joined; the spirit of tolerance and nationality\r\nthat had been spreading through the country was openly manifested.\r\n\r\nIn those times of hope and terror men's minds on both sides moved\r\nquickly. The collapse of the English system was rapid; the government\r\nsaw the failure of their army plans with the refusal of the Irish to\r\ngive any more military grants; the failure of their gains from the\r\nIrish treasury in the near bankruptcy of the Irish state, with the\r\nburden of its upkeep thrown on England; the failure of the prodigious\r\ncorruption and buying of the souls of men before the new spirit that\r\nswept through the island, the spirit of a nation. \"England has sown\r\nher laws in dragons' teeth, and they have sprung up in armed men,\"\r\ncried Hussey Burgh, a worthy Irish successor of Malone in the House of\r\nCommons. \"It is no longer the parliament of Ireland that is to be\r\nmanaged or attended to,\" wrote the lord-lieutenant. \"It is the whole\r\nof this country.\" Above all, the war with the colonies brought home to\r\nthem Grattan's prophecy--\"what you trample on in Europe will sting you\r\nin America.\"\r\n\r\nThe country, through the Volunteers, required four main reforms. They\r\nasked for justice in the law-courts, and that the Habeas Corpus Act\r\nshould be restored, and independent judges no longer hold their places\r\nat pleasure. They asked that the English commercial laws which had\r\nruined Irish industry and sunk the land in poverty and idleness should\r\nbe abandoned; taught by a long misery, Irishmen agreed to buy no\r\nmanufactures but the work of Irish hands, and Dublin men compelled\r\nmembers to swear that they should vote for \"the good of Ireland,\" a\r\nnew phrase in politics. A third demand was that the penal laws which\r\ndivided and broke the strength of Ireland should cease. \"The Irish\r\nProtestant,\" cried Grattan, \"could never be free till the Irish\r\nCatholic had ceased to be a slave.\" \"You are now,\" said Burke,\r\n\"beginning to have a country.\" Finally a great cry for the\r\nindependence of their parliament rose in every county and from every\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nThe demands for the justice of free men, for free trade, free\r\nreligion, a free nation, were carried by the popular passion into the\r\nparliaments of Dublin and London. In three years the Dublin parliament\r\nhad freed Protestant dissenters from the Test Act and had repealed the\r\ngreater part of the penal code; the English commercial code had fallen\r\nto the ground; the Habeas Corpus Act was won. In 1780 Grattan proposed\r\nhis resolutions declaring that while the two nations were inseparably\r\nbound together under one Crown, the King, Lords, and Commons of\r\nIreland could alone make laws for Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe claim for a free parliament ran through the country--\"the epidemic\r\nmadness,\" exclaimed the viceroy. But the Irish had good reason for\r\ntheir madness. At the first stirring of the national movement in 1778\r\n\"artful politicians\" in England had revived a scheme favourably viewed\r\nthere--the abolition of an Irish parliament and the union of Ireland\r\nwith England. \"Do not make an union with us, sir,\" said Dr. Johnson to\r\nan Irishman in 1779; \"we should unite with you only to rob you.\" The\r\nthreat of the disappearance of Ireland as a country quickened anxiety\r\nto restore its old parliament. The Irish knew too how precarious was\r\nall that they had gained. Lord North described all past concessions as\r\n\"resumable at pleasure\" by the power that granted them.\r\n\r\nIn presence of these dangers the Volunteers called a convention of\r\ntheir body to meet in the church of Dungannon on Feb. 15, 1782--to\r\ntheir mind no unfit place for their lofty work.\r\n\r\n\"We know,\" they said, \"our duty to our sovereign and our loyalty; we\r\nknow our duty to ourselves and are resolved to be free.\" \"As\r\nIrishmen, as Christians, and as Protestants\" they rejoiced in the\r\nrelaxation of penal laws and upheld the sacred rights of all to\r\nfreedom of religion. A week later Grattan moved in the House of\r\nCommons an address to the king--that the people of this country are a\r\nfree people; that the crown of Ireland is an imperial crown; and the\r\nkingdom of Ireland a distinct kingdom with a parliament of her own,\r\nthe sole legislature thereof. The battle opened by Molyneux a hundred\r\nyears before was won. The Act of 1719, by which the English parliament\r\nhad justified its usurpation of powers, was repealed (1782). \"To set\r\naside all doubts\" another Act (1783) declared that the right of\r\nIreland to be governed solely by the king and the parliament of\r\nIreland was now established and ascertained, and should never again be\r\nquestioned or questionable.\r\n\r\nOn April 16, 1782, Grattan passed through the long ranks of Volunteers\r\ndrawn up before the old Parliament House of Ireland, to proclaim the\r\nvictory of his country. \"I am now to address a free people. Ages have\r\npassed away, and this is the first moment in which you could be\r\ndistinguished by that appellation.... Ireland is now a nation. In that\r\ncharacter I hail her, and bowing in her august presence, I say _esto\r\nperpetua!_\" The first act of the emancipated parliament was to vote a\r\ngrant for twenty thousand sailors for the English navy.\r\n\r\nThat day of a nation's exultation and thanksgiving was brief. The\r\nrestored parliament entered into a gloomy inheritance--an authority\r\nwhich had been polluted and destroyed--an almost ruined country. The\r\nheritage of a tyranny prolonged through centuries was not to be got\r\nrid of rapidly. England gave to Ireland half a generation for the\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nSince the days of Henry VIII the Irish parliaments had been shaped and\r\ncompacted to give to England complete control. The system in this\r\ncountry, wrote the viceroy, did not bear the smallest resemblance to\r\nrepresentation. All bills had to go through the privy council, whose\r\nsecret and overwhelming influence was backed by the privy council in\r\nEngland, the English law officers, and finally the English cabinet.\r\nIrish proposals were rejected not in parliament, but in these secret\r\ncouncils. The king had a veto in Ireland, not in England. The English\r\ncabinet, changing with English parties, had the last word on every\r\nIrish bill. There was no Irish cabinet responsible to the Irish\r\nHouses: no ministry resigned, whatever the majority by which it was\r\ndefeated. Nominally elected by about one-fifth of the inhabitants, the\r\nCommons did not represent even these. A landlords' assembly, there was\r\nno Catholic in it, and no merchant. Even the Irish landlords were\r\nsubdued to English interests: some hundred Englishmen, whose main\r\nproperty was in England but who commanded a number of votes for lands\r\nin Ireland, did constantly override the Irish landlords and drag them\r\non in a policy far from serviceable to them. The landlords' men in the\r\nCommons were accustomed to vote as the Castle might direct. In the\r\ncomplete degradation of public life no humiliation or lack of public\r\nhonour offended them. The number of placemen and pensioners equalled\r\nnearly one-half of the whole efficient body: \"the price of a seat of\r\nparliament,\" men said, \"is as well ascertained as that of the cattle\r\nof the field.\"\r\n\r\nAll these dangers might with time and patience be overcome. An Irish\r\nbody, on Irish soil, no matter what its constitution, could not remain\r\naloof from the needs, and blind to the facts, of Ireland, like\r\nstrangers in another land. The good-will of the people abounded; even\r\nthe poorer farmers showed in a better dress, in cleanliness, in\r\nself-respect, how they had been stirred by the dream of freedom, the\r\nhope of a country. The connection with England, the dependence on the\r\nking, was fully accepted, and Ireland prepared to tax herself out of\r\nall proportion to her wealth for imperial purposes. The gentry were\r\nlosing the fears that had possessed them for their properties, and a\r\nfair hope was opening for an Ireland tolerant, united, educated, and\r\nindustrious. Volunteers, disciplined, sober, and law-abiding, had\r\nshown the orderly forces of the country. Parliament had awakened to\r\nthe care of Ireland as well as the benefit of England. In a few years\r\nit opened \"the gates of opulence and knowledge.\" It abolished the\r\ncruelties of the penal laws, and prepared the union of all religions\r\nin a common citizenship. It showed admirable knowledge in the method\r\nof restoring prosperity to the country, awakening its industrial life,\r\nincreasing tillage, and opening inland navigation. Time was needed to\r\nclose the springs of corruption and to bring reform to the parliament\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nBut the very success of parliament woke fears in England, and alarm in\r\nthe autocratic government of Ireland. Jealous of power, ministers set\r\nthemselves to restore by corruption an absolute authority, and recover\r\nby bribery the prerogative that had been lost.\r\n\r\nThe first danger appeared in 1785, in the commercial negotiations with\r\nEngland. To crush the woollen trade England had put duties of over L2\r\na yard on a certain cloth carried from Ireland to England, which paid\r\n5-1/2d. if brought from England to Ireland; and so on for other goods.\r\nIrish shipping had been reduced to less than a third of that of\r\nLiverpool alone. Pitt's proposal of free trade between the countries\r\nwas accepted by Ireland (1785), but a storm of wrath swept over the\r\nBritish world of business; they refused Pitt's explanation that an\r\nIreland where all industries had been killed could not compete\r\nagainst the industrial pre-eminence of England; and prepared a new\r\nscheme which re-established the ascendency of the British parliament\r\nover Irish navigation and commerce. This was rejected in Ireland as\r\nfatal to their Constitution. Twice again the Irish parliament\r\nattempted a commercial agreement between the two countries: twice the\r\nIrish government refused to give it place; a few years later the same\r\nministers urged the Union on the ground that no such commercial\r\narrangement existed. The advantages which England possessed and should\r\nmaintain were explained by the viceroy to Pitt in 1792. \"Is not the\r\nvery essence of your imperial policy to prevent the interest of\r\nIreland clashing and interfering with the interest of England?... Have\r\nyou not crushed her in every point that would interfere with British\r\ninterest or monopoly by means of her parliament for the last century,\r\ntill lately?... You know the advantages you reap from Ireland.... In\r\nreturn does she cost you one farthing (except the linen monopoly)? Do\r\nyou employ a soldier on her account she does not pay, or a single\r\nship more for the protection of the British commerce than if she was\r\nat the bottom of the sea?\"\r\n\r\nThe Catholic question also awakened the Castle fears. The penal laws\r\nhad failed to diminish the \"Papists\": at the then rate of conversion\r\nit would take four thousand years to turn the people into Protestants.\r\nA nobler idea had arisen throughout Ireland. \"The question is now,\"\r\nGrattan said, \"whether we shall be a Protestant settlement or an Irish\r\nnation ... for so long as we exclude Catholics from natural liberty\r\nand the common rights of man we are not a people.\" Nothing could be\r\nmore unwelcome to the government. A real union between religious\r\nbodies in Ireland, they said, would induce Irish statesmen to regulate\r\ntheir policy mainly by the public opinion of their own country. To\r\navert this danger they put forth all their strength. \"The present\r\nframe of Irish government is particularly well calculated for our\r\npurpose. That frame is a Protestant garrison in possession of the\r\nland, magistracy, and power of the country; holding that property\r\nunder the tenure of British power and supremacy, and ready at every\r\ninstant to crush the rising of the conquered.\"\r\n\r\nFinally the pressing question of reform, passionately demanded by\r\nProtestant and Catholic for fifteen years, was resisted by the whole\r\nmight of the Castle. \"If,\" wrote the lord-lieutenant to Pitt, \"as her\r\ngovernment became more open and more attentive to the feelings of the\r\nIrish nation, the difficulty of management had increased, is that a\r\nreason for opening the government and making the parliament more\r\nsubservient to the feelings of the nation at large?\"\r\n\r\nTo the misfortune both of Ireland and of England the Irish government\r\nthrough these years was led by one of the darkest influences known in\r\nthe evil counsels of its history--the chancellor Fitzgibbon, rewarded\r\nby England with the title Earl of Clare. Unchecked by criticism,\r\nsecret in machinations, brutal in speech, and violent in authority, he\r\nhad known the use of every evil power that still remained as a legacy\r\nfrom the past. By working on the ignorance of the cabinet in London\r\nand on the alarms and corruptions of Ireland, by using all the secret\r\npowers left in his hands through the privy council, by a system of\r\nunexampled bribery, he succeeded in paralysing the constitution which\r\nit was his business to maintain, and destroying the parliamentary\r\nrights which had been nominally conceded. The voice of the nation was\r\nsilenced by the forbidding of all conventions. In the re-established\r\n\"frame of government\" Fitzgibbon was all-powerful. The only English\r\nviceroy who resisted him, Lord Fitzwilliam, was recalled amid the\r\nacclamations and lamentations of Ireland--all others yielded to his\r\nforce. Government in his hands was the enemy of the people, parliament\r\na mockery, constitutional movements mere vanity. Law appeared only as\r\nan instrument of oppression; the Catholic Irish were put out of its\r\nprotection, the government agents out of its control. The country\r\ngentry were alienated and demoralised--left to waste with \"their inert\r\nproperty and their inert talents.\" Every reform was refused which\r\nmight have allayed the fears of the people. Religious war was secretly\r\nstirred up by the agents of the government and in its interest,\r\nsetting one part of the country to exterminate the other. Distrust\r\nand suspicion, arrogance and fear, with their train of calamities for\r\nthe next hundred years distracted the island.\r\n\r\nA system of absolute power, maintained by coercion, woke the deep\r\npassion of the country. Despair of the constitution made men turn to\r\nrepublicanism and agitation in arms. The violent repression of freedom\r\nwas used at a time when the progress of the human mind had been\r\nprodigious, when on all sides men were drinking in the lessons of\r\npopular liberties from the republics of America and France. The system\r\nof rule inaugurated by Fitzgibbon could have only one end--the revolt\r\nof a maddened people. Warnings and entreaties poured in to the Castle.\r\nTo the very last the gentry pleaded for reform to reassure men\r\ndrifting in their despair into plots of armed republicanism. Every\r\nmeasure to relieve their fears was denied, every measure to heighten\r\nthem was pursued. Violent statesmen in the Castle, and officers of\r\ntheir troops, did not fear to express their sense that a rebellion\r\nwould enable them to make an end of the discontented once for all, and\r\nof the Irish Constitution. The rising was, in fact, at last forced by\r\nthe horrors which were openly encouraged by the government in 1796-7.\r\n\"Every crime, every cruelty, that could be committed by Cossacks or\r\nCalmucks has been transacted here,\" said General Abercromby, sent in\r\n1797 as commander-in-chief. He refused the barbarities of martial rule\r\nwhen, as he said, the government's orders might be carried over the\r\nwhole kingdom by an orderly dragoon, or a writ executed without any\r\ndifficulty, a few places in the mountains excepted; and demanded the\r\nmaintenance of law. \"The abuses of all kinds I found here can scarcely\r\nbe believed or enumerated.\" \"He must have lost his senses,\" wrote\r\nClare of the great soldier, and \"this Scotch beast,\" as he called him,\r\nwas forced out of the country as Lord Fitzwilliam had been. Abercromby\r\nwas succeeded by General Lake, who had already shown the ferocity of\r\nhis temper in his command in Ulster, and in a month the rebellion\r\nbroke out.\r\n\r\nThat appalling tale of terror, despair, and cruelty cannot be told in\r\nall its horror. The people, scared into scattered risings, refused\r\nprotection when their arms were given up, or terms if they\r\nsurrendered, were without hope; the \"pacification\" of the government\r\nset no limits to atrocities, and the cry of the tortured rose\r\nunceasingly day and night.\r\n\r\nThe suppression of the rebellion burned into the Irish heart the\r\nbelief that the English government was their implacable enemy, that\r\nthe law was their oppressor, and Englishmen the haters of their race.\r\nThe treatment of later years has not yet wiped out of memory that\r\nhorror. The dark fear that during the rebellion stood over the Irish\r\npeasant in his cabin has been used to illustrate his credulity and his\r\nbrutishness. The government cannot be excused by that same plea of\r\nfear. Clare no doubt held the doctrine of many English governors\r\nbefore him, that Ireland could only be kept bound to England by the\r\nruin of its parliament and the corruption of its gentry, the perpetual\r\nanimosity of its races, and the enslavement of its people. But even in\r\nhis own day there were men who believed in a nobler statesmanship--in\r\na union of the nations in equal honour and liberties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nIRELAND UNDER THE UNION\r\n\r\n1800-1900\r\n\r\n\r\nThe horror of death lay over Ireland; cruelty and terror raised to a\r\nfrenzy; government by martial law; a huge army occupying the country.\r\nIn that dark time the plan for the Union with England, secretly\r\nprepared in London, was announced to the Irish parliament.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that England had everything to gain by a union. There was\r\none objection. Chatham had feared that a hundred Irishmen would\r\nstrengthen the democratic side of the English parliament; others that\r\ntheir eloquence would lengthen and perhaps confuse debates. But it was\r\nheld that a hundred members would be lost in the British parliament,\r\nand that Irish doctrines would be sunk in the sea of British common\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland a union was detested as a conspiracy against its liberties.\r\nThe parliament at once rejected it; no parliament, it was urged, had a\r\nright to pass an act destroying the constitution of Ireland, and\r\nhanding over the dominion to another country, without asking consent\r\nof the nation. Pitt refused to have anything to say to this Jacobin\r\ndoctrine of the sovereignty of the people--a doctrine he would oppose\r\nwherever he encountered it.\r\n\r\nThe Union, Pitt said, was no proposal to subject Ireland to a foreign\r\nyoke, but a voluntary association of two great countries seeking their\r\ncommon benefit in one empire. There were progresses of the viceroy,\r\nvisits of political agents, military warnings, threats of eviction, to\r\ninduce petitions in its favour; all reforms were refused--the\r\noutrageous system of collecting tithes, the disabilities of\r\nCatholics--so as to keep something to bargain with; 137,000 armed men\r\nwere assembled in Ireland. But amid the universal detestation and\r\nexecration of a Union the government dared not risk an election, and\r\nproceeded to pack the parliament privately. By official means the\r\nCommons were purged of sixty-three opponents, and safe men put in,\r\nsome Englishmen, some staff-officers, men without a foot of land in\r\nIreland. There were, contrary to one of the new laws, seventy-two\r\nplace-holders and pensioners in the House. Fifty-four peerages were\r\ngiven to buy consciences. The borough-holders were offered 1-1/4\r\nmillions to console them for loss in sale of seats. There was a host\r\nof minor pensions. Threats and disgrace were used to others. Large\r\nsums were sent from London to bribe the Press, and corrupt the\r\nwavering with ready money. Pitt pledged himself to emancipation.\r\n\r\nThus in 1800, at the point of the sword, and amid many adjurations to\r\nspeed from England, the Act of Union was forced through the most\r\ncorrupt parliament ever created by a government: it was said that only\r\nseven of the majority were unbribed. An Act \"formed in the British\r\ncabinet, unsolicited by the Irish nation,\" \"passed in the middle of\r\nwar, in the centre of a tremendous military force, under the influence\r\nof immediate personal danger,\" was followed, as wise men had warned,\r\nby generations of strife. A hundred years of ceaseless agitation, from\r\nthe first tragedy of Robert Emmet's abortive rising in 1803,\r\nproclaimed the undying opposition of Irishmen to a Union that from the\r\nfirst lacked all moral sanction.\r\n\r\nAn English parliament, all intermediate power being destroyed, was now\r\nconfronted with the Irish people. Of that people it knew nothing, of\r\nits national spirit, its conception of government or social life. The\r\nhistory and literature which might reveal the mind of the nation is so\r\nneglected that to this day there is no means for its study in the\r\nImperial University, nor the capital of Empire. The _Times_ perceived\r\nin \"the Celtic twilight\" a \"slovenly old barbarism.\" Peel in his\r\nignorance thought Irishmen had good qualities except for \"a general\r\nconfederacy in crime ... a settled and uniform system of guilt,\r\naccompanied by horrible and monstrous perjuries such as could not be\r\nfound in any civilised country.\"\r\n\r\nPromises were lavished to commend the Union. Ministers assured Ireland\r\nof less expenditure and lighter taxation: with vast commerce and\r\nmanufactures, a rise in the value of land, and a stream of English\r\ncapital and industry. All contests being referred from the island to\r\nGreat Britain--to a body not like the Irish influenced by prejudices\r\nand passions--Ireland would for the first time arrive at national\r\nunion. The passing over to London of the chief part of Irish\r\nintelligence and wealth would give to Ireland \"a power over the\r\nexecutive and general policy of the Empire which would far more than\r\ncompensate her\"; and would, in fact, lead to such a union of hearts\r\nthat presently it would not matter, Pitt hoped, whether members for\r\nIreland were elected in Ireland or in England. Ireland would also be\r\nplaced in \"a natural situation,\" for by union with the Empire she\r\nwould have fourteen to three in favour of her Protestant\r\nestablishment, instead of three to one against it as happened in the\r\ncountry itself; so that Protestant ascendency would be for ever\r\nassured. The Catholics, however, would find in the pure and serene air\r\nof the English legislature impartial kindness, and the poor might hope\r\nfor relief from tithes and the need of supporting their clergy. All\r\nIrish financiers and patriots contended that the fair words were\r\ndeceptive, and that the Union must bring to Ireland immeasurable\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nAny discussion of the Union in its effect on Ireland lies apart from a\r\ndiscussion of the motives of men who administered the system in the\r\nlast century. The system itself, wrongly conceived and wrongly\r\nenforced, contained the principles of ruin, and no good motives could\r\nmake it work for the benefit of Ireland, or, in the long run, of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nOppressive financial burdens were laid on the Irish. Each country was\r\nfor the next twenty years to provide for its own expenditure and debt,\r\nand to contribute a sum to the general expenses of the United Kingdom,\r\nfixed in the proportion of seven and a half parts for Great Britain\r\nand one part for Ireland. The debt of Ireland had formerly been small;\r\nin 1793 it was 2-1/4 millions; it had risen to nearly 28 millions by\r\n1801, in great measure through the charges of Clare's policy of\r\nmartial law and bribery. In the next years heavy loans were required\r\nfor the Napoleonic war. When Ireland, exhausted by calamity, was\r\nunable to pay, loans were raised in England at heavy war-rates and\r\ncharged to the public debt of Ireland. In 1817 the Irish debt had\r\nincreased more than fourfold, to nearly 113 millions. No record was\r\nmade in the books of the Exchequer as to what portion of the vast sums\r\nraised should in fairness be allotted to Ireland; there is no proof\r\nthat there was any accuracy in the apportionment. The promised lighter\r\ntaxation ended in a near bankruptcy, and the approach of an appalling\r\nfamine in 1817. Bankruptcy was avoided by uniting the two treasuries\r\nto form one national debt--but the burden of Ireland remained as\r\noppressive as before. Meanwhile the effect of the Union had been to\r\ndepress all Irish industries and resources, and in these sixteen years\r\nthe comparative wealth of Ireland had fallen, and the taxes had risen\r\nfar beyond the rise in England. The people sank yet deeper under their\r\nheavy load. The result of their incapacity to pay the amount fixed at\r\nthe Union was, that of all the taxes collected from them for the next\r\nfifty-three years, one-third was spent in Ireland, and two-thirds were\r\nabsorbed by England; from 1817 to 1870 the cost of government in\r\nIreland was under 100 millions, while the contributions to the\r\nimperial exchequer were 210 millions, so that Ireland sent to England\r\nmore than twice as much as was spent on her. The tribute from Ireland\r\nto England in the last ninety-three years, over and above the cost of\r\nIrish administration, has been over 325 millions--a sum which would\r\nprobably be much increased by a more exact method both of recording\r\nthe revenue collected from Ireland and the \"local\" and \"imperial\"\r\ncharges, so as to give the full Irish revenue, and to prevent the\r\ndebiting to Ireland of charges for which she was not really liable.\r\nWhile this heavy ransom was exacted Ireland was represented as a\r\nbeggar, never satisfied, at the gates of England.\r\n\r\nLater, in 1852, Gladstone began to carry out the second part of the\r\nUnion scheme, the indiscriminate taxation of the two countries. In a\r\nfew years he added two and a half millions to Irish taxation, at a\r\nmoment when the country, devastated by famine, was sinking under the\r\nloss of its corn trade through the English law, and wasting away by\r\nemigration to half its former population. In 1896 a Financial\r\nCommission reported that the Act of Union had laid on Ireland a burden\r\nshe was unable to bear; and that, in spite of the Union pledge that\r\nthe ability of Ireland to pay should always be taken into account, she\r\nwas paying one-eleventh of the tax revenue of the United Kingdom while\r\nher taxable capacity was one-twentieth or less. While Great Britain\r\npaid less than two shillings in every pound of her taxable surplus,\r\nIreland paid about ten shillings in every pound of hers. No relief was\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nUnder this drain of her wealth the poverty or Ireland was intensified,\r\nmaterial progress was impossible, and one bad season was enough to\r\nproduce wide distress, and two a state of famine. Meanwhile, the cost\r\nof administration was wasteful and lavish, fixed on the high prices of\r\nthe English scale, and vastly more expensive than the cost of a\r\ngovernment founded on domestic support and acceptable to the people.\r\nThe doom of an exhausting poverty was laid on Ireland by a rich and\r\nextravagant partner, who fixed the expenses for English purposes,\r\ncalled for the money, and kept the books.\r\n\r\nThe Union intensified the alien temper of Irish government. We may\r\nremember the scandal caused lately by the phrase of a great Irish\r\nadministrator that Ireland should be governed according to Irish\r\nideas. Dublin Castle, no longer controlled by an Irish parliament,\r\nentrenched itself more firmly against the people. Some well-meaning\r\ngovernors went over to Ireland, but the omnipotent Castle machine\r\nbroke their efforts for impartial rule or regard for the opinion of\r\nthe country. The Protestant Ascendancy openly reminded the Castle that\r\nits very existence hung on the Orange associations. Arms were supplied\r\nfree from Dublin to the Orangemen while all Catholics were disarmed.\r\nThe jobbing of the grand juries to enrich themselves out of the\r\npoor--the traffic of magistrates who violated their duties and their\r\noaths--these were unchanged. Justice was so far forgotten that the\r\npresiding judge at the trial of O'Connell spoke of the counsel for the\r\naccused as \"the gentleman on the other side.\" Juries were packed by\r\nthe sheriffs with Protestants, by whom all Orangemen were acquitted,\r\nall Catholics condemned, and the credit of the law lowered for both by\r\na system which made the juryman a tool and the prisoner a victim. It\r\nis strange that no honest man should have protested against such a use\r\nof his person and his creed. In the case of O'Connell the Chief\r\nJustice of England stated that the practice if not remedied must\r\nrender trial by jury \"a mockery, a delusion, and a snare\"; but\r\njury-packing with safe men remained the invariable custom till 1906.\r\n\r\nNothing but evil to Ireland followed from carrying her affairs to an\r\nEnglish parliament. The government refused the promised emancipation,\r\nrefused tithe reform. Englishmen could not understand Irish\r\nconditions. The political economy they advocated for their own country\r\nhad no relation to Ireland. The Irish members found themselves, as\r\nEnglish officials had foretold in advocating the Union, a minority\r\nwholly without influence. Session after session, one complained,\r\nmeasures supported by Irish members, which would have been hailed with\r\nenthusiasm by an Irish parliament, were rejected by the English.\r\nSession after session measures vehemently resisted by the Irish\r\nmembers were forced on a reluctant nation by English majorities. When\r\nIreland asked to be governed by the same laws as England, she was told\r\nthe two countries were different and required different treatment.\r\nWhen she asked for any deviation from the English system, she was told\r\nthat she must bow to the established laws and customs of Great\r\nBritain. The reports of royal commissions fell dead--such as that\r\nwhich in 1845 reported that the sufferings of the Irish, borne with\r\nexemplary patience, were greater than the people of any other country\r\nin Europe had to sustain. Nothing was done. Instead of the impartial\r\ncalm promised at the Union, Ireland was made the battle-cry of English\r\nparties; and questions that concerned her life or death were important\r\nat Westminster as they served the exigencies of the government or the\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nAll the dangers of the Union were increased by its effect in drawing\r\nIrish landlords to London. Their rents followed them, and the wealth\r\nspent by absentees founded no industries at home. A land system\r\nbrought about by confiscation, and developed by absentees, meant\r\nunreclaimed wastes, lands half cultivated, and neglected people.\r\nLandlords, said an indignant judge of wide experience in a charge to a\r\njury in 1814, should build their tenants houses, and give them at\r\nleast what they had not as yet, \"the comforts of an English sow.\" To\r\npay rent and taxes in England the toilers raised stores of corn and\r\ncattle for export there, from the value of eight million pounds in\r\n1826 to seventeen million pounds of food stuffs in 1848, and so on.\r\nThey grew potatoes to feed themselves. If the price of corn fell\r\nprodigiously--as at the end of the Napoleonic war, or at the passing\r\nof the corn laws in England--the cheaper bread was no help to the\r\npeasants, most of whom could never afford to eat it; it only doubled\r\ntheir labour to send out greater shiploads of provisions for the\r\ncharges due in England. On the other hand, if potatoes rotted, famine\r\nswept over the country among its fields of corn and cattle. And when\r\nrent failed, summary powers of eviction were given at Westminster\r\nunder English theories for use in Ireland alone; \"and if anyone would\r\ndefend his farm it is here denominated rebellion.\" Families were flung\r\non the bogs and mountain sides to live on wild turnips and nettles, to\r\ngather chickweed, sorrel, and seaweed, and to sink under the fevers\r\nthat followed vagrancy, starvation, cold, and above all the broken\r\nhearts of men hunted from their homes. In famine time the people to\r\nsave themselves from death were occasionally compelled to use blood\r\ntaken from live bullocks, boiled up with a little oatmeal; and the\r\nappalling sight was seen of feeble women gliding across the country\r\nwith their pitchers, actually trampling upon fertility and fatness, to\r\ncollect in the corner of a grazier's farm for their little portion of\r\nblood. Five times between 1822 and 1837 there were famines of lesser\r\ndegree: but two others, 1817 and 1847, were noted as among the\r\nhalf-dozen most terrible recorded in Europe and Asia during the\r\ncentury. From 1846 to 1848 over a million lay dead of hunger, while in\r\na year food-stuffs for seventeen million pounds were sent to England.\r\nEnglish soldiers guarded from the starving the fields of corn and the\r\nwaggons that carried it to the ports; herds of cattle were shipped,\r\nand skins of asses which had served the famishing for food. New\r\nevictions on an enormous scale followed the famine, the clearance of\r\nwhat was then called in the phrase of current English economics \"the\r\nsurplus population,\" \"the overstock tenantry.\" They died, or fled in\r\nhosts to America--Ireland pouring out on the one side her great stores\r\nor \"surplus food,\" on the other her \"surplus people,\" for whom there\r\nwas nothing to eat. In the twenty years that followed the men and\r\nwomen who had fled to America sent back some thirteen millions to keep\r\na roof over the heads of the old and the children they had left\r\nbehind. It was a tribute for the landlords' pockets--a rent which\r\ncould never have been paid from the land they leased. The loans raised\r\nfor expenditure on the Irish famine were charged by England on the\r\nIrish taxes for repayment.\r\n\r\nNo Irish parliament, no matter what its constitution, could have\r\nallowed the country to drift into such irretrievable ruin. O'Connell\r\nconstantly protested that rather than the Union he would have the old\r\nProtestant parliament. \"Any body would serve if only it is in\r\nIreland,\" cried a leading Catholic nationalist in Parnell's time; \"the\r\nProtestant synod would do.\" In the despair of Ireland, the way was\r\nflung open to public agitation, and to private law which could only\r\nwield the weapons of the outlaw. All methods were tried to reach the\r\ndistant inattention of England. There were savage outbursts of men\r\noften starving and homeless, always on the edge of famine--Levellers,\r\nThreshers, and the like; or Whiteboys who were in fact a vast trades\r\nunion for the protection of the Irish peasantry, to bring some order\r\nand equity into relations of landlord and tenant. Peaceful\r\norganisation was tried; the Catholic Association for Emancipation\r\nfounded by O'Connell in 1823, an open society into which Protestants\r\nand Catholics alike were welcomed, kept the peace in Ireland for five\r\nyears; outrage ceased with its establishment and revived with its\r\ndestruction. His Association for Repeal (1832-1844) again lifted the\r\npeople from lawless insurrection to the disciplined enthusiasm of\r\ncitizens for justice. A Young Ireland movement (1842-1848) under\r\nhonoured names such as Thomas Davis and John Mitchel and Gavan Duffy\r\nand Smith O'Brien and others with them, sought to destroy sectarian\r\ndivisions, to spread a new literature, to recover Irish history, and\r\nto win self-government, land reform, and education for a united people\r\nof Irish and English, Protestant and Catholic. The suppression of\r\nO'Connell's peaceful movement by the government forced on violent\r\ncounsels; and ended in the rising of Smith O'Brien as the only means\r\nleft him of calling attention to the state of the country. The\r\ndisturbances that followed have left their mark in the loop-holed\r\npolice barracks that covered Ireland. There was a Tenant League (1852)\r\nand a North and South League. All else failing, a national physical\r\nforce party was formed; for its name this organization went back to\r\nthe dawn of Irish historic life--to the Fiana, those Fenian national\r\nmilitia vowed to guard the shores of Ireland. The Fenians (1865)\r\nresisted outrage, checked agrarian crime, and sought to win\r\nself-government by preparing for open war. A great constitutionalist\r\nand sincere Protestant, Isaac Butt, led a peaceful parliamentary\r\nmovement for Home Rule (1870-1877); after him Charles Stewart Parnell\r\nfought in the same cause for fourteen years (1877-1891) and died with\r\nvictory almost in sight. Michael Davitt, following the advice of Lalor\r\nthirty years before, founded a Land League (1879) to be inevitably\r\nmerged in the wider national issue. Wave after wave of agitation\r\npassed over the island. The manner of the national struggle changed,\r\npeaceful or violent, led by Protestant or Catholic, by men of English\r\nblood or of Gaelic, but behind all change lay the fixed purpose of\r\nIrish self-government. For thirty-five years after the Union Ireland\r\nwas ruled for three years out of every four by laws giving\r\nextraordinary powers to the government; and in the next fifty years\r\n(1835-1885) there were only three without coercion acts and crime\r\nacts. By such contrasts of law in the two countries the Union made a\r\ndeep severance between the islands.\r\n\r\nIn these conflicts there was not now, as there had never been in their\r\nhistory, a religious war on the part of Irishmen. The oppressed people\r\nwere of one creed, and the administration of the other. Protestant\r\nand Catholic had come to mean ejector and ejected, the armed Orangeman\r\nand the disarmed peasant, the agent-or clergy-magistrate and the\r\nbroken tenant before his too partial judgment-seat. In all cases where\r\nconflicting classes are divided into two creeds, religious incidents\r\nwill crop up, or will be forced up, to embitter the situation; but the\r\nIrish struggle was never a religious war.\r\n\r\nAnother distinction must be noted. Though Ireland was driven to the\r\n\"worst form of civil convulsion, a war for the means of subsistence,\"\r\nthere was more Irish than the battle for food. Those who have seen the\r\npiled up graves round the earth where the first Irish saints were\r\nlaid, will know that the Irishman, steeped in his national history,\r\nhad in his heart not his potato plot alone, but the thought of the\r\nhome of his fathers, and in the phrase of Irish saints, \"the place of\r\nhis resurrection.\"\r\n\r\nIf we consider the state of the poor, and the position of the millions\r\nof Irishmen who had been long shut out from any share in public\r\naffairs, and forbidden to form popular conventions, we must watch\r\nwith amazement the upspringing under O'Connell of the old idea of\r\nnational self-government. Deep in their hearts lay the memory carried\r\ndown by bards and historians of a nation whose law had been maintained\r\nin assemblies of a willing people. In O'Connell the Irish found a\r\nleader who had like themselves inherited the sense of the old Irish\r\ntradition. To escape English laws against gatherings and conventions\r\nof the Irish, O'Connell's associations had to be almost formless, and\r\nperpetually shifting in manner and in name. His methods would have\r\nbeen wholly impossible without a rare intelligence in the peasantry.\r\nLocal gatherings conducted by voluntary groups over the country;\r\nconciliation courts where justice was carried out apart from the\r\nordinary courts as a protest against their corruption; monster\r\nmeetings organised without the slightest disorder; voluntary\r\nsuppression of crime and outrage--in these we may see not merely an\r\nastonishing popular intelligence, but the presence of an ancient\r\ntradition. At the first election in which the people resisted the\r\nright of landlords to dictate their vote (1826), a procession miles\r\nin length streamed into Waterford in military array and unbroken\r\ntranquillity. They allowed no rioting, and kept their vow of total\r\nabstinence from whisky during the election. A like public virtue was\r\nshown in the Clare election two years later (1828) when 30,000 men\r\ncamped in Ennis for a week, with milk and potatoes distributed to them\r\nby their priests, all spirits renounced, and the peace not broken once\r\nthroughout the week. As O'Connell drew towards Limerick and reached\r\nthe Stone where the broken Treaty had been signed, 50,000 men sent up\r\ntheir shout of victory at this peaceful redeeming of the violated\r\npledges of 1690. In the Repeal meetings two to four hundred thousand\r\nmen assembled, at Tara and other places whose fame was in the heart of\r\nevery Irishman there, and the spirit of the nation was shown by a\r\ngravity and order which allowed not a single outrage. National hope\r\nand duty stirred the two millions who in the crusade of Father Mathew\r\ntook the vow of temperance.\r\n\r\nIn the whole of Irish history no time brought such calamity to Ireland\r\nas the Victorian age. \"I leave Ireland,\" said one, \"like a corpse on\r\nthe dissecting table.\" \"The Celts are gone,\" said Englishmen, seeing\r\nthe endless and disastrous emigration. \"The Irish are gone, and gone\r\nwith a vengeance.\" That such people should carry their interminable\r\ndiscontent to some far place seemed to end the trouble. \"Now for the\r\nfirst time these six hundred years,\" said _The Times_, \"England has\r\nIreland at her mercy, and can deal with her as she pleases.\" But from\r\nthis death Ireland rose again. Thirty years after O'Connell Parnell\r\ntook up his work. He used the whole force of the Land League founded\r\nby Davitt to relieve distress and fight for the tenants' rights; but\r\nhe used the land agitation to strengthen the National movement. He\r\nmade his meaning clear. What did it matter, he said, who had\r\npossession of a few acres, if there was no National spirit to save the\r\ncountry; he would never have taken off his coat for anything less than\r\nto make a nation. In his fight he held the people as no other man had\r\ndone, not even O'Connell. The conflict was steeped in passion. In 1881\r\nthe government asked for an act giving them power to arrest without\r\ntrial all Irishmen suspected of illegal projects--a power beyond all\r\ncoercion hitherto. O'Connell had opposed a coercion act in 1833 for\r\nnineteen nights; Parnell in 1881 fought for thirty-two nights.\r\nParliament had become the keeper of Irish tyrannies, not of her\r\nliberties, and its conventional forms were less dear to Irishmen than\r\nthe freedom of which it should be the guardian. He was suspended, with\r\nthirty-four Irish members, and 303 votes against 46 carried a bill by\r\nwhich over a thousand Irishmen were imprisoned at the mere will of the\r\nCastle, among them Parnell himself. The passion of rage reached its\r\nextreme height with the publication in _The Times_ (1888) of a\r\nfacsimile letter from Parnell, to prove his consent to a paid system\r\nof murder and outrage. A special commission found it to be a forgery.\r\n\r\nWith the rejection of Gladstone's Home Rule bills in 1886 and 1893,\r\nand with the death of Parnell (1891), Irish nationalists were thrown\r\ninto different camps as to the means to pursue, but they never\r\nfaltered in the main purpose. That remains as firm as in the times of\r\nO'Connell, Thomas Davis, John O'Leary, and Parnell, and rises once\r\nmore to-day as the fixed unchanging demand, while the whole Irish\r\npeople, laying aside agitations and controversies, stand waiting to\r\nhear the end.\r\n\r\nThe national movement had another side, the bringing back of the\r\npeople to the land. The English parliament took up the question under\r\npressure of violent agitation in Ireland. By a series of Acts the\r\npeople were assured of fair rents and security from eviction. Verdicts\r\nof judicial bodies tended to prove that peasants were paying 60 per\r\ncent. above the actual value of the land. But the great Act of 1903--a\r\nwork inspired by an Irishman's intellect and heart--brought the final\r\nsolution, enabling the great mass of the tenants to buy their land by\r\ninstalments. Thus the land war of seven hundred years, the war of\r\nkings and parliaments and planters, was brought to a dramatic close,\r\nand the soil of Ireland begins again to belong to her people.\r\n\r\nThere was yet another stirring of the national idea. In its darkest\r\ndays the country had remained true to the old Irish spirit of\r\nlearning, that fountain of the nation's life. In O'Connell's time the\r\n\"poor scholar\" who took his journey to \"the Munster schools\" was sent\r\nout with offerings laid on the parish altars by Protestants and\r\nCatholics alike; as he trudged with his bag of books and the fees for\r\nthe master sewn in the cuff of his coat, he was welcomed in every\r\nfarm, and given of the best in the famishing hovels: \"The Lord prosper\r\nhim, and every one that has the heart set upon the learning.\" Bards\r\nand harpers and dancers wandered among the cottages. A famous bard\r\nRaftery, playing at a dance heard one ask, \"Who is the musician?\" and\r\nthe blind fiddler answered him:\r\n\r\n    \"I am Raftery the poet,\r\n    Full of hope and love,\r\n    With eyes that have no light,\r\n    With gentleness that has no misery.\r\n\r\n    Going west upon my pilgrimage,\r\n    Guided by the light of my heart,\r\n    Feeble and tired,\r\n    To the end of my road.\r\n\r\n    Behold me now,\r\n    With my face to a wall,\r\n    A-playing music\r\n    To empty pockets.\"\r\n\r\nUnknown scribes still copied piously the national records. A Louth\r\nschoolmaster could tell all the stars and constellations of heaven\r\nunder the old Irish forms and names. A vision is given to us through a\r\ngovernment Ordnance Survey of the fire of zeal, the hunger of\r\nknowledge, among the tillers and the tenants. In 1817 a dying farmer\r\nin Kilkenny repeated several times to his sons his descent back to the\r\nwars of 1641 and behind that to a king of Munster in 210\r\nA.D.--directing the eldest never to forget it. This son took his\r\nbrother, John O'Donovan, (1809-1861) to study in Dublin; in Kilkenny\r\nfarmhouses he learned the old language and history of his race. At the\r\nsame time another Irish boy, Eugene O'Curry (1796-1862), of the same\r\nold Munster stock, working on his father's farm in great poverty,\r\nlearned from him much knowledge of Irish literature and music. The\r\nOrdnance Survey, the first peripatetic university Ireland had seen\r\nsince the wanderings of her ancient scholars, gave to O'Donovan and\r\nO'Curry their opportunity, where they could meet learned men, and use\r\ntheir hereditary knowledge. A mass of material was laid up by their\r\nhelp. Passionate interest was shown by the people in the memorials of\r\ntheir ancient life--giants' rings, cairns, and mighty graves, the\r\ntwenty-nine thousand mounds or moats that have been counted, the raths\r\nof their saints and scholars--each with its story living on the lips\r\nof the people till the great famine and the death or emigration of the\r\npeople broke that long tradition of the race. The cry arose that the\r\nsurvey was pandering to the national spirit. It was suddenly closed\r\n(1837), the men dismissed, no materials published, the documents\r\nlocked up in government offices. But for O'Donovan and O'Curry what\r\nprodigies of work remained. Once more the death of hope seemed to call\r\nout the pieties of the Irish scholar for his race, the fury of his\r\nintellectual zeal, the passion of his inheritance of learning. In the\r\nblackest days perhaps of all Irish history O'Donovan took up Michael\r\nO'Clery's work of two hundred years before, the Annals of the Four\r\nMasters, added to his manuscript the mass of his own learning, and\r\ngave to his people this priceless record of their country (1856).\r\nAmong a number of works that cannot be counted here, he made a\r\nDictionary which recalls the old pride of Irishmen in their language.\r\nO'Curry brought from his humble training an incredible industry,\r\ngreat stores of ancient lore, and an amazing and delicate skill as a\r\nscribe. All modern historians have dug in the mine of these men's\r\nwork. They open to Anglo-Irish scholars such as Dr. Reeves and Dr.\r\nTodd, a new world of Irish history. Sir Samuel Ferguson began in 1833\r\nto give to readers of English the stories of Ireland. George Petrie\r\ncollected Irish music through all the west, over a thousand airs, and\r\nworked at Irish inscriptions and crosses and round towers. Lord\r\nDunraven studied architecture, and is said to have visited every\r\nbarony in Ireland and nearly every island on the coast.\r\n\r\nThese men were nearly all Protestants; they were all patriots. Potent\r\nIrish influences could have stirred a resident gentry and resident\r\nparliament with a just pride in the great memorials of an Ireland not\r\ndead but still living in the people's heart. The failure of the hope\r\nwas not the least of the evils of the Union. The drift of landlords to\r\nLondon had broken a national sympathy between them and the people,\r\nwhich had been steadily growing through the eighteenth century. Their\r\nsons no longer learned Irish, nor heard the songs and stories of the\r\npast. The brief tale of the ordnance survey has given us a measure of\r\nthe intelligence that had been wasted or destroyed by neglect in\r\nIreland. Archbishop Whately proposed to use the new national schools\r\nso as to make this destruction systematic, and to put an end to\r\nnational traditions. The child who knew only Irish was given a teacher\r\nwho knew nothing but English; his history book mentioned Ireland\r\n_twice_ only--a place conquered by Henry II., and made into an English\r\nprovince by the Union. The quotation \"This is my own, my native land,\"\r\nwas struck out of the reading-book as pernicious, and the Irish boy\r\nwas taught to thank God for being \"a happy English child.\" A Connacht\r\npeasant lately summed up the story: \"I suppose the Famine and the\r\nNational Schools took the heart out of the people.\" In fact famine and\r\nemigration made the first great break in the Irish tradition that had\r\nbeen the dignity and consolation of the peasantry; the schools\r\ncompleted the ruin. In these, under English influence, the map of\r\nIreland has been rolled up, and silence has fallen on her heroes.\r\n\r\nEven out of this deep there came a revival. Whitley Stokes published\r\nhis first Irish work the year after O'Curry's death; and has been\r\nfollowed by a succession of laborious students. Through a School of\r\nIrish Learning Dublin is becoming a national centre of true Irish\r\nscholarship, and may hope to be the leader of the world in this great\r\nbranch of study. The popular Irish movement manifested itself in the\r\nGaelic League, whose branches now cover all Ireland, and which has\r\nbeen the greatest educator of the people since the time of Thomas\r\nDavis. Voluntary colleges have sprung up in every province, where\r\nearnest students learn the language, history, and music of their\r\ncountry; and on a fine day teacher and scholars gathered in the open\r\nair under a hedge recall the ancient Irish schools where brehon or\r\nchronicler led his pupils under a tree. A new spirit of self-respect,\r\nintelligence, and public duty has followed the work of the Gaelic\r\nLeague; it has united Catholic and Protestant, landlord and peasant.\r\nAnd through all creeds and classes a desire has quickened men to\r\nserve their country in its social and industrial life; and by\r\nAgricultural Societies, and Industrial Development Societies, to\r\nawaken again her trade and manufactures.\r\n\r\nThe story is unfinished. Once again we stand at the close of another\r\nexperiment of England in the government of Ireland. Each of them has\r\nbeen founded on the idea of English interests; each has lasted about a\r\nhundred years--\"Tudor conquest,\" Plantations, an English parliament, a\r\nUnion parliament. All alike have ended in a disordered finance and a\r\nflight of the people from the land.\r\n\r\nGrattan foretold the failure of the Union and its cause. \"As Ireland,\"\r\nhe said, \"is necessary to Great Britain, so is complete and perfect\r\nliberty necessary to Ireland, and both islands must be drawn much\r\ncloser to a free constitution, that they may be drawn closer to one\r\nanother.\" In England we have seen the advance to that freer\r\nconstitution. The democracy has entered into larger liberties, and has\r\nbrought new ideals. The growth of that popular life has been greatly\r\nadvanced by the faith of Ireland. Ever since Irish members helped to\r\ncarry the Reform Acts they have been on the side of liberty, humanity,\r\npeace, and justice. They have been the most steadfast believers in\r\nconstitutional law against privilege, and its most unswerving\r\ndefenders. At Westminster they have always stood for human rights, as\r\nnobler even than rights of property. What Chatham foresaw has come\r\ntrue: the Irish in the English parliament have been powerful\r\nmissionaries of democracy. A freedom-loving Ireland has been\r\nconquering her conquerors in the best sense.\r\n\r\nThe changes of the last century have deeply affected men's minds. The\r\nbroadening liberties of England as a free country, the democratic\r\nmovements that have brought new classes into government, the wider\r\nexperience of imperial methods, the growing influence of men of\r\ngood-will, have tended to change her outlook to Ireland. In the last\r\ngeneration she has been forced to think more gravely of Irish\r\nproblems. She has pledged her credit to close the land question and\r\ncreate a peasant proprietary. With any knowledge of Irish history the\r\nreligious alarm, the last cry of prejudice, must inevitably disappear.\r\nThe old notion of Ireland as the \"property\" of England, and of its\r\nexploitation for the advantage of England, is falling into the past.\r\n\r\nA mighty spirit of freedom too has passed over the great Colonies and\r\nDominions. They since their beginning have given shelter to outlawed\r\nIrishmen flying from despair at home. They have won their own pride of\r\nfreedom, and have all formally proclaimed their judgment that Ireland\r\nshould be allowed the right to shape her own government. The United\r\nStates, who owe so much to Irishmen in their battle for independence,\r\nand in the labours of their rising prosperity, have supported the\r\ncause of Ireland for the last hundred years; ever since the first\r\nimportant meeting in New York to express American sympathy with\r\nIreland was held in 1825, when President Jackson, of Irish origin, a\r\nProtestant, is said to have promised the first thousand dollars to the\r\nIrish emancipation fund.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland itself we see a people that has now been given some first\r\nopportunities of self-dependence and discipline under the new\r\nconditions of land ownership and of county government. We see too the\r\nbreaking up of the old solid Unionist phalanx, the dying down of\r\nancient fears, the decaying of old habits of dependence on military\r\nhelp from England, and a promise of revival of the large statesmanship\r\nthat adorned the days of Kildare and of Grattan. It is singular to\r\nreflect that on the side of foreign domination, through seven hundred\r\nyears of invasion and occupation, not a single man, Norman or English,\r\nwarrior or statesman, has stood out as a hero to leave his name, even\r\nin England, on the lips or in the hearts of men. The people who were\r\ndefending their homes and liberties had their heroes, men of every\r\ncreed and of every blood, Gaelic, Norman, English, Anglican, Catholic,\r\nand Presbyterian. Against the stormy back-ground of those prodigious\r\nconflicts, those immeasurable sorrows, those thousand sites\r\nconsecrated by great deeds, lofty figures emerge whom the people have\r\nexalted with the poetry of their souls, and crowned with love and\r\ngratitude--the first martyr for Ireland of \"the foreigners\" Earl\r\nThomas of Desmond, the soul of another Desmond wailing in the Atlantic\r\nwinds, Kildare riding from his tomb on the horse with the silver\r\nshoes, Bishop Bedell, Owen Roe and Hugh O'Neill, Red Hugh O'Donnell,\r\nSarsfield, Lord Edward Fitzgerald, Robert Emmett, O'Connell, Davis,\r\nParnell--men of peace and men of war, but all lovers of a free nation.\r\n\r\nIn memory of the long, the hospitable roll of their patriots, in\r\nmemory of their long fidelities, in memory of their national faith,\r\nand of their story of honour and of suffering, the people of Ireland\r\nonce more claim a government of their own in their native land, that\r\nshall bind together the whole nation of all that live on Irish soil,\r\nand create for all a common obligation and a common prosperity. An\r\nIrish nation of a double race will not fear to look back on Irish\r\nhistory. The tradition of that soil, so steeped in human passion, in\r\njoy and sorrow, still rises from the earth. It lives in the hearts of\r\nmen who see in Ireland a ground made sacred by the rare intensity of\r\nhuman life over every inch of it, one of the richest possessions that\r\nhas ever been bequeathed by the people of any land whatever to the\r\nsuccessors and inheritors of their name. The tradition of national\r\nlife created by the Irish has ever been a link of fellowship between\r\nclasses, races, and religions. The natural union approaches of the\r\nIrish Nation--the union of all her children that are born under the\r\nbreadth of her skies, fed by the fatness of her fields, and nourished\r\nby the civilisation of her dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME IRISH WRITERS ON IRISH HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n  JOYCE, P.W.--Social History of Ancient Ireland. 2 vols. 1903.\r\n     This book gives a general survey of the old Irish\r\n     civilisation, pagan and Christian, apart from political\r\n     history.\r\n\r\n  FERGUSON, SIR SAMUEL.--Hibernian Nights' Entertainments. 1906.\r\n     These small volumes of stories are interesting as the effort of\r\n     Sir S.
