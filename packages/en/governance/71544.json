To the traveller who merely\r\npasses through it, it looks like a fruitful garden, capable of affording\r\nsupport to as many inhabitants as can gather round its neat towns, or\r\nsettle on the borders of its orchards, hop-grounds, and corn-fields; yet\r\nit is certain that nowhere,—not in the alleys of Manchester or the\r\ncellars of London,—is more abject, hopeless poverty to be found than in\r\nsome of the country parishes of Kent. One class murmurs about tithes,\r\nand rages about poor-rates, while another sets law at defiance, and\r\nfills the country with news of murderous poaching expeditions, and of\r\nmidnight fires;—guilty adventures, of which the first brings in only a\r\nprecarious and dearly bought advantage, and the other is the most\r\neffectual method that could be devised for increasing the very evils\r\nunder which the people are groaning.\r\n\r\nSome years ago,—before the first ruffian or fool of a rick-burner had\r\nconceived the bright idea of destroying food because the people were\r\nstarving,—the parish of A——, in Kent, seemed to some of its inhabitants\r\nto be sunk into the lowest depth of poverty that could be found in a\r\ncountry like England; though, alas! it has since been proved that more\r\nremained to be endured by its population than had yet been experienced.\r\nThe parish of A—— contained at that time about two thousand persons; the\r\nnumber of labourers, including boys, was about 450, of whom upwards of\r\n300 were of the agricultural class. The farmers were doing badly, and\r\ncould not employ all these people; or, if they employed all, could not\r\nsufficiently pay any. They reckoned that there were between fifty and\r\nsixty able-bodied men more than were wanted. The burden on the parish of\r\nthese men and their wives and families was very grievous to the poorer\r\nclass of rate-payers; and in proportion as it became more difficult to\r\nthem to pay, the numbers and the wants of the paupers increased; and\r\namong the whole body of the population of A—— the effects of want showed\r\nthemselves more and more every day in the spread of recklessness and\r\ncrime. It mattered not that in spring the orchards were gay with the\r\ndelicate pink of the apple-blossom, or that flourishing young\r\nplantations put forth their early verdure as if the place had been a\r\nparadise; for there were theft in the woods, and murmurs of discontent\r\nfrom beneath the hedgerows. It mattered not that in autumn the\r\nhop-pickers were busy gathering in their fragrant harvest; for too many\r\nof them had fathers, or brothers, or sons, looking on idly from a\r\ndistance, envious of their employed companions, and thankless that the\r\nseason had been propitious to the ripening of the delicate crop. It\r\nmattered not that the sun shone on fertile valleys and snug homesteads:\r\nfor many a houseless parent scowled upon comforts which he must not\r\nshare; many a child shivered with disease and hunger amidst the noonday\r\nheat. It mattered not even that new dwellings for the poor were rising\r\nup here and there; for their creation was no sign of prosperity. They\r\nwere reared by speculators in pauperism, who depended on the rents being\r\npaid out of the rate. From this circumstance, it was easy to guess by\r\nwhat class they would be occupied;—not by such cottagers as England\r\nboasted of a century and a half ago, but by reckless youths with their\r\nyounger wives, who depended on the parish to help out the insufficient\r\nresources of their labour.\r\n\r\nThese new cottages were an eye-sore to some of the once-prosperous\r\ninhabitants of the parish, who were for ever complaining that the bread\r\nwas snatched from their mouths by new comers. Among the grumblers was\r\nCastle; a man who, without fault of his own, was, in the full vigour of\r\nlife, reduced from a state of comfortable independence to the very verge\r\nof pauperism. He had married early, and proved himself justified in\r\ndoing so, having been able, not only to support the two children of his\r\nfirst marriage, but to fit them for maintaining themselves by proper\r\ntraining in their occupations. Frank had served his apprenticeship to a\r\nhouse-carpenter, and was now a skilful and industrious workman of\r\none-and-twenty years of age. His sister Ellen, three years younger, was\r\na neat-handed dairy-maid, whom any farmer might be glad to have in his\r\nestablishment. That she was out at service, and that Frank had something\r\nto do, however little, were the chief comforts of poor Castle at this\r\ntime; for his own affairs looked dismal enough. He had married a second\r\ntime, a woman much younger than himself, who had never known hardship,\r\nand was little prepared to meet it, however gay her temper seemed before\r\nthere was any thing to try it. She did nothing for her husband but bring\r\nhim children and nurse them till they died, which they almost all did as\r\ntimes grew worse and comforts became scarce. Only one little girl, now\r\nsix years old, remained at home of all his second family. There were\r\nindeed two lads who called him father, though he had for some time\r\ndisowned them as sons. He declared that Jerry and Bob were born rogues\r\nand vagabonds; and gave a peevish notice to all whom it might concern\r\nthat he had cast them off to follow their evil courses, as they were so\r\ngiven to theft that it would ruin him to be made answerable for their\r\nmisdeeds. Some people thought that fifteen and sixteen were ages at\r\nwhich some hope of reformation was yet left; and saw moreover that the\r\nlads had been driven to crime by want, and prevented from returning by\r\ndread of their parents’ tempers. Castle was now almost invariably low\r\nand peevish; and at five-and-forty had the querulous tone, wrinkled\r\nface, and lagging gait of an old man. The effect of hardship had been\r\neven worse upon his wife than upon himself. Instead of being peevish,\r\nshe seemed to have lost all feeling; and while her husband yet worked as\r\nlong as he could get any thing to do, she was as lazy as if she had been\r\nbrought up to live on parish bread. The only person who believed that\r\nany good remained in her was her step-daughter Ellen, who never forgot\r\nwhat a trying change of circumstances she had been exposed to, and\r\npersisted in saying, whenever she heard her attacked, that a\r\ntwelvemonth’s health and prosperity would show her to be a very\r\ndifferent person from what the neighbours supposed. “Give her help and\r\nhope,” she said, “give her work and something to work for, and her voice\r\nwill come down to what it was when she sang her first baby to sleep; and\r\nshe will clean up her room herself, instead of preventing any one doing\r\nit for her. She will go to church again then, and learn to like Frank as\r\nshe should do, and not curse her own poor boys as she does.” Some of\r\nEllen’s neighbours thought this cant; others believed her sincere in her\r\nhopes of her step-mother; but all agreed, when the crisis of Castle’s\r\naffairs arrived at last, that, honestly or hypocritically, Ellen\r\nprophesied wrong.\r\n\r\nNews came that Jerry and Bob had been taken up for robbing and cruelly\r\nbeating two young gentlemen whom they had decoyed into a wood on\r\npretence of birds-nesting; and that, if not hanged, they would be\r\ntransported. Castle declared, though with a quivering lip, that this was\r\nwhat he had always expected. His wife went further. She hoped they would\r\nbe hanged, and put out of the way of being more trouble to any body. She\r\nexhorted her husband to take no steps on their behalf, but be thankful\r\nthat he was rid of them. The neighbours cried “Shame!” and prevailed\r\nwith Castle so far as to induce him to go to the magistrate who had\r\ncommitted the lads, and swear to their ages; as they were taken by\r\nstrangers to be much older than they really were, and an explanation on\r\nthis point might procure a mitigation of punishment. Castle was\r\nunwilling to leave home for two days while his wife was hourly expecting\r\nher confinement; but a woman who lodged in the same cottage offered to\r\nbe with her, on condition of receiving the same attention from her when\r\nshe should want it a short time hence.—Castle was scarcely gone when his\r\nwife had to send for assistance; and before her child was born, the\r\nneighbour who was with her was in a similar plight. It was the middle of\r\nthe night; and the parish surgeon who attended them had no help at hand,\r\nand could not leave them to call for any. He wrapped up the two infants\r\nin the remains of a blanket, and laid them beside the fire he had\r\nhimself lighted. It very naturally happened that he did not know which\r\nwas which of the children, and that he had not presence of mind to\r\nconceal the difficulty. On taking them up, it was found that one was\r\ndead. His horror was great on perceiving that, instead of there being\r\nany regret on this account, each mother was anxious to make out that the\r\ndead infant must be her own. Neither of them would touch the living\r\none[A].\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A:\r\n\r\n  Fact.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAn unobserved or forgotten witness appeared in the person of Castle’s\r\nlittle daughter Susan, who had crept out from her dark corner to peep at\r\nthe babes in the blanket.\r\n\r\n“That is the one you wrapped up first, Sir,” she said, pointing to the\r\nliving infant.\r\n\r\n“How do you know, my dear?”\r\n\r\n“She knows well enough,” said the neighbour; “she had nothing to do but\r\nto watch. She——”\r\n\r\n“How do you know, my dear?” persisted the surgeon.\r\n\r\n“Because this corner of the blanket fell under the grate, and got all\r\nblack; and when you brought the other baby you wrapped it up in the\r\nblack part. Look!”\r\n\r\n“’Tis all true,” said Castle’s wife, “and her child was born first.”\r\n\r\nThe surgeon set her right, and considered the matter decided; but it was\r\nfar from being so. She scolded her little daughter for her testimony\r\ntill the child slunk out of the room; she pushed the infant roughly from\r\nher, and cursed it for its cries. Her neighbour insultingly told her it\r\nwas certainly sent to make up to her for one of the lads that was going\r\nto be hanged, and that it was only a pity she had not had twins. Words,\r\ndreadful to hear from a mother’s lips, followed. The contention grew\r\nlouder and more violent, till the surgeon, fearing for their lives and\r\nsenses, and being unable any longer to bear a scene so unnatural and\r\nhorrible, left the room, bearing with him the innocent cause of dispute.\r\nLittle Susan was on the stairs, still sobbing and afraid to go in; so\r\nshe was also taken home by the surgeon, when he had sent in a neighbour\r\nto tend his two patients.\r\n\r\n“Here, my dear,” said he to his wife, on entering his own door, “put\r\nthis child to bed somewhere, and try if you can contrive to keep the\r\ninfant alive till we can send it to the workhouse in the morning.”\r\n\r\n“What has agitated you so much? Whose children are these?”\r\n\r\n”The children of Providence only, my dear; for the hearts of parents are\r\nturned against their own offspring in these days.—What have I seen! I\r\nhave seen the contention of mothers for a dead child. I have been with\r\nmothers who would thank any Solomon that should order the living child\r\nto be cut in two. Solomon himself could not read mothers’ hearts in\r\nthese days.”\r\n\r\n“We will not be hard upon them,” said his wife. “It is want that has\r\ndone this;—want like that which made a mother of Solomon’s nation devour\r\nher own child. We will not blame them. Would we could help them!”\r\n\r\nThe matter ended in the infant’s being received into the workhouse,\r\nlittle Susan’s testimony, though strong, not being so conclusive as to\r\njustify the surgeon’s swearing to the parentage of the child; and there\r\nwas no one else who could. When Castle returned, he observed that it\r\nsignified little, as the parish must at all events have maintained the\r\nbabe; neither he nor his neighbours could keep out of the workhouse much\r\nlonger. This was soon found to be too true, when Ellen came home, being\r\nobliged to give up her place to a parish girl, and Frank appeared, with\r\na grave face, to say that he was out of work, and had been so for so\r\nlong a time, that he was convinced nothing was to be done but to go and\r\nseek his fortune elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMany were the consultations between himself and his sister as to where\r\nhe should go. There was but little chance of being better off in\r\nEngland. He mentioned Canada; he rather inclined to the Swan-river\r\nsettlement; but when news came that Jerry and Bob were sentenced to\r\ntransportation, the idea struck the brother and sister at once that the\r\nwhole family might follow, and by settling near the convicts, keep an\r\neye upon them, and possibly recover them when they should be removed\r\nfrom the temptations which had proved too strong for them. Frank had\r\nheard much of the advantages of emigrating to New South Wales and Van\r\nDiemen’s Land; and it appeared to him that no family was ever in\r\ncircumstances that made the experiment less perilous than his own at\r\nthis time. While Ellen took upon herself to mention the scheme to her\r\nfather, Frank went to the curate of the parish, Mr. Jackson, whom he\r\nknew to have been employed in forwarding the emigration of some pauper\r\nlabourers from the neighbourhood; and from this gentleman he learned\r\nmuch of what he wanted to know.\r\n\r\nIt was to Van Diemen’s Land that Mr. Jackson had assisted in sending out\r\nsome of his parishioners; and thither he advised Frank to go with his\r\nfamily, as there was a great demand for labour, both agricultural and\r\nmechanical, and as it would be the best situation for Ellen, from the\r\ngreat scarcity of female servants, especially dairy-women. It seemed\r\nvery possible that interest might be made to get their brothers sent to\r\nthe same place, as there were many convicts there already, and more were\r\nwanted as farm-servants. As to how the means of conveyance were to be\r\nraised,—the common method, Mr. Jackson said, was for labourers to bind\r\nthemselves for five or seven years to some settler in the colony, at a\r\ncertain rate of wages, from which the expenses of the passage, and of\r\nfood, clothing and habitation for the term of years, were to be\r\ndeducted. Castle and his wife might thus bind themselves, the one as a\r\nfarm, the other as a domestic servant in a family; and Frank’s\r\nmechanical skill might enable him to make very good terms in the same\r\nsort of agreement. For Ellen, a better way still was open, if she could\r\nfortunately get included in the number of young women who were to be\r\nsent out by government from time to time, to supply the great want of\r\nfemale population in the Australian colonies. Mr. Jackson lent Frank\r\nbooks which informed him of the state and prospects of the country\r\nwhither he wished to go, and several papers issued by government which\r\nexplained the terms under which emigration was authorized by them. Frank\r\nfound that the sum of money necessary to be raised was somewhat larger\r\nthan he had supposed, but that the means of repayment were certain and\r\neasy. If Ellen could obtain a certificate from the clergyman of her\r\nparish, that she was between the ages of eighteen and thirty, that her\r\nhealth and character were good, and that half the expense of her\r\npassage, namely, 8l., could be advanced by her parents, or friends, or\r\nthe parish, she might stand her chance of being chosen by the government\r\nto be sent out under safe guardianship, and immediately placed in a\r\nservice on her arrival in the colony. There would be no impediment to\r\nher marrying as soon as she chose to do so; for which there were only\r\ntoo many opportunities from the circumstance of there being a very small\r\nproportion of women in the colony. If the parish could be prevailed on\r\nto advance the necessary sum for the conveyance of the rest of the\r\nfamily, it seemed that the prospects of all would become far better than\r\nthey could ever grow at home,—better than Frank had dared to imagine\r\nsince his childhood. It seemed so clearly the interest of the parish to\r\nfavour the plan, that Frank returned to the consultation with Mr.\r\nJackson, full of hope that a way was opening for finding, in a new\r\ncountry, those due rewards of labour which his native land seemed no\r\nlonger in a condition to afford.\r\n\r\n“What says your father to your scheme?” inquired Mr. Jackson in the\r\nfirst place.\r\n\r\n“Very much what he says to all schemes, Sir. He likes nothing that is\r\nproposed, and fears every new plan. But as he dislikes and fears\r\nbecoming dependent on the parish more than any thing else, I have great\r\nhopes that he will consent to go, if, after further consideration, I\r\nview the matter as I do now. We will do nothing hastily; but I certainly\r\nfeel at present as if redemption was offered from a bondage which wears\r\nthe soul and sickens the heart of man. There’s my poor father——”\r\n\r\n“Stay, stay, Frank. What do you mean by bondage?”\r\n\r\n“The bondage of poverty, Sir; of hopeless, grinding poverty. What\r\nbondage cows a man’s spirit more? What sours and debases and goads him\r\nmore than to work and work from year to year in vain? If it was a curse\r\nupon Adam to get bread by the sweat of his brow, what is it to give the\r\nsweat of one’s brow and get no bread?”\r\n\r\n“It is a hardship which ought not to be borne when a fair way is open to\r\nshake it off. I only checked you in the fear that you might be laying\r\nblame where it is not due. I agree with you as to the evils of your\r\ncase, and the remedy you would seek.”\r\n\r\n“As to where the blame lies, Sir, our institutions must share it among\r\nthem;—as well those in which the people are concerned, as the\r\ngovernment. It is pretty clear, all the while, that the people in this\r\nparish are more than can be fed; and so the right way seems to be for\r\nsome to go where food abounds; and the sooner they are off, the better\r\nfor themselves and those they leave behind, when once they have settled\r\nwhere to go.”\r\n\r\n“And who is to go?—for that is a question of no less importance,”\r\nobserved Mr. Jackson. “You would not take all your relations, Frank,\r\nwould you?”\r\n\r\nFrank replied that they were all equally in want, his grandfather and\r\ngrandmother as well as his father.\r\n\r\n“But those who will help you to go,” continued Mr. Jackson, “must\r\nconsider the welfare of the country as well as yours. The parish must\r\npay more for the passage and maintenance of your grandfather than he\r\nwill probably cost them at home, and this cannot be expected of them if,\r\nfor the same sum, they could send over a young couple, whose labour is\r\nwanted abroad, and whose family will never become burdensome.”\r\n\r\nFrank saw at once that in sending over a young couple, the parish sent\r\nover also all their descendants, besides supplying a want in the colony\r\nabroad. After a few moments’ thought, he went on,—\r\n\r\n“Surely, Sir, it would relieve the country of its over-fulness at once,\r\nto send out a certain number of young people every year, as they become\r\nmarriageable, instead of spending the same money in giving a passage to\r\nold people?”\r\n\r\n“It would; and the entire effect of emigration, as a method of relief to\r\nthe country at large, depends on the selection of those who are to go.\r\nThe number of persons who become marriageable every year in this country\r\nis now 800,000. If these were sent out, it is plain that the country\r\nwould be depopulated in the course of a single generation; but if we\r\nsent out the same number of old persons, it would make a very small\r\ndifference in the amount of people at home; and it would not be worth\r\nthe colony’s while to receive those who would bring little labour and no\r\npopulation. If, again, we sent out that number of men and boys to a\r\ncolony where there are too few women already, we should afford ourselves\r\nonly a half-relief, and give the colony nothing more than the present\r\nlabour of these men and boys; whereas, by sending equal proportions of\r\nmen and women, we give the colony all their descendants as well as\r\nthemselves, and free ourselves from the same amount of labour,—which we\r\ndo not want.”\r\n\r\n“A much smaller number than 800,000 would be enough then, Sir, to thin\r\nour population sufficiently?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. If, instead of sending out people of all ages, we were to\r\nselect those who become marriageable, one-sixth of that number, or about\r\n133,000 persons emigrating annually, would prevent our population\r\nincreasing; and this might be done at an expense not exceeding a fourth\r\nof the sum annually raised for poor-rate, sending half to America and\r\nhalf to Australia. This would be well worth while, even if there were to\r\nbe no repayment of expenses; which there might and ought to be from\r\ncolonies where labour is much wanted.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid,” said Frank, “that the parish will refuse to help my\r\nfather and mother to emigrate, if it would answer so much better to send\r\nyounger people.”\r\n\r\n“Your father is still in the vigour of life, and may benefit the colony\r\nby twenty years’ active labour yet; and your step-mother is several\r\nyears younger. The parish sends out many less likely to repay them; but\r\nI do think your grandfather and his old lady are quite out of the\r\nquestion, even if they wished ever so much to go. But why should they go\r\nwhere every thing will be strange and therefore uncomfortable to them,\r\nand where they must, after all, be quite as dependent as at home? If you\r\nmean to maintain them, you can as well send money to them here as carry\r\nthem over at a great expense, to receive it there; and if you cannot\r\nhelp them, they will be more forlorn there than living on their own\r\nparish. But you will be able to help them, since a fourth of your wages\r\nis all that the parish will require from you, and this will very soon\r\npay off your debt. Ellen’s 8_l._ will easily be earned; and when she has\r\nworked herself free, she will be able to help the old folks.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis when I think of her,” said Frank, “that I am most eager to get to\r\na place where toil is not in vain. As often as I hear her laugh, or\r\nwatch her going about the house with her light step and busy pair of\r\nhands, I tremble lest I should see a scowl come over her face by and by,\r\nand her gait and actions grow listless, like so many of the women\r\nhereabouts. It must be owing to want and helplessness that our girls\r\ncannot be merry without being bold; and that they are so given to\r\nidleness which has nothing of the nature of play in it. I can remember\r\nmy step-mother, Sir, just such a pretty, light-hearted woman as Ellen.”\r\n\r\n“You will see more such if you go to Van Diemen’s Land. There is toil\r\nthere, and hardship too; but the toil is hopeful, and the hardship not\r\nof man’s infliction.—I know you do not object to toil and hardship of\r\nthis kind, Frank, or I should be the last person to encourage you to go.\r\nYou must give up English likings as to food and lodging, and (what is\r\nmore difficult) as to ways of doing things. You must bear to be directed\r\nwhat work you are to do, and how you are to do it; you must resolve from\r\nthe beginning to accommodate yourself to the people and the place,\r\nwithout thinking and talking too much about how things are in England.”\r\n\r\n“All this is easy, Sir, for the sake of plenty and independence.”\r\n\r\n“I trust you will find it so. But, Frank, there are other things to be\r\nconsidered, both for your own sake and Ellen’s. You probably see that in\r\nthe present state of the colony, particular sobriety and discretion are\r\nrequired in all the young women that go there.”\r\n\r\nFrank was quite ready to answer for his sister; and hoped that a\r\nsettlement with a respectable husband would soon place her out of reach\r\nof temptation. He perceived that he would find it less easy to marry\r\nthan he might wish; and this seemed the greatest drawback to the plan:\r\nbut, perhaps, when he should be prosperous enough to marry, he might\r\nsend over for a wife, as he heard some settlers did; or might be\r\nfortunate enough to find one that he would like among the new emigrants\r\nwho would be coming over from time to time.\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson advised him not to think much about this at present, if he\r\nreally intended to go; and agreed with him that there appeared still\r\nless chance of his marrying in England, if he continued to be too\r\nconscientious to form such a pauper marriage as many of his neighbours\r\nwere venturing upon.\r\n\r\nFrom this day, Frank began tutoring himself and his sister for the new\r\nway of life they hoped to enter upon. They learned all they could, from\r\nbooks and persons, about the changes they might look for out of their\r\nown country. They inured themselves purposely to toil and heat and cold,\r\nand strove to bear with patience the trials of temper which continually\r\narose. There was only one thing which they did not try to bear\r\npatiently; and that was, receiving parish-pay. Their father was as much\r\ndisgusted at it as themselves; and this assisted his reconcilement to\r\nthe emigration plan. He would not give his children the satisfaction of\r\nsaying that he liked it, or hoped any thing from it; but he vowed he\r\nwould not stay where he was; and as there was no other place to go to,\r\nthis implied assent. He looked with sullenness on the preparations that\r\nwere made; but he did nothing in the way of hinderance; nor did he\r\ncontradict his neighbours when they took for granted that he was going.\r\nSo Frank and Ellen considered the matter settled as far as he was\r\nconcerned; and rather expected to see him much disappointed if any thing\r\nshould occur to overthrow the plan. His wife seemed utterly indifferent\r\nwhether she went or staid, or what became of her; and the whole business\r\nseemed to rest upon the two young people and their friend, Mr. Jackson.\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                          HOMES ON THE WASTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the deliberations were going forwards, some rumours which arose\r\nout of them reached the ears of a very influential gentleman in the\r\nneighbourhood, to whom they were not at all agreeable. Mr. Fellowes was\r\na young man of large property, who had just come of age, and whose\r\nkindly disposition and activity of observation equally inclined him to\r\nmake the condition of the surrounding poor one of his first objects of\r\ninterest. He had for some time been investigating their state and its\r\ncauses, with a view to doing something for their relief when he should\r\nhave the control of his fortune. He had fully satisfied himself of the\r\nevils of the poor-law system, and that the one thing wanted was an\r\nincreased production of food,—an object, in his belief, very easy of\r\naccomplishment. This he intended to prove by an experiment of his own;\r\nor that which his friends called an experiment,—and he a demonstration.\r\nHis plan became known to Mr. Jackson in due time, as well as to many\r\nothers less willing to listen to what he had to say, and to regard his\r\nexertions with the seriousness and kindness which their importance, and\r\nthe benevolence of their motives deserved. It was with equal good will\r\nthat these two gentlemen met at the parsonage-door one day, each having\r\nquestions to put to the other.\r\n\r\n“Pray is it true,” inquired Mr. Fellowes, “that you are encouraging the\r\nCastles and others of your parishioners to emigrate?”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly true; and I was coming to you to make a request as to\r\nsomething I wish you to do as soon as they are gone.”\r\n\r\n“Let us see first whether it is necessary for them to go. Is it quite\r\nsettled? Are they past being persuaded?”\r\n\r\n“Their passage is not taken, but their minds are made up, and Ellen\r\nCastle’s name is sent in to government.”\r\n\r\n“It may be refused; and in that case there is time to save them yet.”\r\n\r\n“Save them from what?”\r\n\r\n“From what! From the manifold woes of the emigrant. Is it no evil to\r\nleave the country, and the kindred, and the father’s house? Is it no\r\nevil to be severed from old connexions, and wrenched from all that has\r\nbeen beloved from birth? Is it no evil to be set down in a wilderness,\r\nwhere climate, soil, the habits of the people where there are any, and\r\nthe solitude where there are not, are all uncongenial, and whatever\r\nhappens is new and strange? Is it no evil to be banished?”\r\n\r\n“All these are great evils, I grant: but from which of them are the\r\nCastles likely to suffer so much as by remaining here? Their country\r\naffords no kindly home for them. They will be disgraced in the eyes of\r\ntheir kindred by becoming a public burden; and their father’s house long\r\nago passed into hands better able to keep it up than theirs. They leave\r\nlittle behind that they love; for want has chilled their affections\r\ntowards their country, and hardship is fast breeding hatred to the\r\npowers which have not hitherto succeeded in securing the happiness of\r\nthe people. As for the rest,—they are going to a fine climate a fertile\r\nsoil, and among inhabitants who speak their language, and are under the\r\nsame government with themselves. While they have plenty and independence\r\nbefore them, and leave only want and woe behind, I cannot think there is\r\nany cruelty in assisting them to go whither they wish.”\r\n\r\n“But, Sir, you are assuming that they must prosper abroad and be\r\ndestitute at home; whereas I assert that neither the one nor the other\r\nneed be the case. Look at the Swan-river settlement! There was no end of\r\nthe praise we heard of the climate, and the soil, and the facilities of\r\nevery kind; and yet where was there ever a more complete failure?”\r\n\r\n“Through these very facilities the failure happened,” replied Mr.\r\nJackson. “Land was so cheap, and required so little capital to be laid\r\nout on it at first, that every labourer chose to have land, instead of\r\nletting his labour to capitalists. The consequence was, that capitalists\r\ncould do nothing for want of labourers; and by the time their goods were\r\nrotted on the beach, and their cattle had strayed or died for want of\r\nproper care, the provisions they took out with them were consumed, the\r\nnew crops had not come up, and all were reduced to equal distress. It\r\nwas because all would be capitalists at first that all became\r\nlabourers,—and very poor labourers, at last. This need not be the case\r\nagain; and, in fact, the Castles hire themselves by contract to\r\ncapitalists long settled in the parts they are going to.—And now tell me\r\nwhy it need not be that these people should be exposed to want and woe\r\nat home.”\r\n\r\n“Simply because they might be colonized here instead of abroad. I am\r\nsure we have waste land enough and to spare for all our population.”\r\n\r\n“As to space, undoubtedly; but what say you to its quality? Why is it\r\nstill waste in the midst of a hungry population, if it is worth being\r\ntilled?”\r\n\r\n“Let us try whether it is not; that is all I ask. Send the Castles, and\r\ntwenty other families to me, and let us see whether corn will not come\r\nup upon well-dug ground, as it has ever done till now.—Remember that the\r\ncondition of land varies under the influences of nature, and that soil\r\nonce barren need not remain barren for ever. Nature works,—more slowly\r\nit is true,—but not less surely than man, in preparing the waste for his\r\nsupport; and there is always a point of time, sooner or later, when he\r\nmay take the work out of her hands and feed upon the fruits of her\r\nministrations. Wherever there are furrows, wherever there are mounds,\r\nthere is a growth of fertile soil. Particles of sand are brought by the\r\nwinds to mix with decaying herbage. Minute seeds of plants and the\r\ndecomposed elements of vegetable substances float in the atmosphere, are\r\narrested by the first elevation they come in contact with, and settle\r\ndown to enrich the land. The vegetation which springs up attracts the\r\nmoisture of the air, and thus is fertility again promoted. It spreads\r\nand spreads till a desert becomes a field, or in a condition to be made\r\none. O, you may trust to nature to provide for man!”\r\n\r\n“I question nothing of what you have said,” replied Mr. Jackson. “On the\r\ncontrary, when I preach of Providence, I use as arguments whatever\r\nprocesses of co-operation and amelioration we can distinguish among the\r\nworkings of nature, from the counteracting forces by which the planets\r\nare retained in their orbits, to the method by which the crevice of the\r\nrock exchanges, in due time, its carpet of moss for a crest of branching\r\noaks. But nature is slow in her workings; and since the life of man is\r\nshort, his business is to work with her, not to wait for her. Every acre\r\nof ground may in course of ages become capable of tillage; but our\r\nbusiness meanwhile is to place our hungry brethren where nature’s work\r\nis forwardest. Among the many grades of fertility prepared by her, it is\r\nour wisdom to choose the highest. This is what I preach as the truest\r\ngratitude to Providence.”\r\n\r\n“I have rather wondered, I own, at the style of your preaching lately.\r\nIt would strike a stranger as unusual.”\r\n\r\n“I do not preach for strangers, but for my own flock; and if they are\r\nnot enlightened enough to apply abstract principles, I must help them to\r\ndo so. I must not only tell them to be honest, but show that honesty can\r\nscarcely subsist under overwhelming temptations to theft and fraud. I\r\nmust not only recommend the domestic affections, but warn against\r\nturning them to bitterness by rashly incurring the risk of that\r\ndestitution under which parents and children learn to look coldly on\r\neach other. I must not only speak of gratitude to God, but show how it\r\nmay be made to spring up by distributing to all a share of his gifts,\r\ninstead of being starved out by want and woe. If, as I believe, it be\r\ntrue that hardness of the lot brings hardness of the heart, and that\r\nblasphemy is a disease of the spirit-broken, how can I and other\r\nministers of the gospel promote its influences so well as by teaching\r\nhow to bring about that state of society which is most congenial to\r\nthose influences?”\r\n\r\n“Yours is a more likely way to gain your object than theirs who\r\ncarefully separate the interests of the other world from those of the\r\npresent.—Well! I am about to preach to the same effect by my actions as\r\nyou from your pulpit.”\r\n\r\n“Then, if you would second my doctrines, you must do the thing I told\r\nyou I meant to ask of you. You must take down the cottages inhabited by\r\nthose about to emigrate; and it must be done immediately on their\r\ndeparture, or I shall have to publish the banns of nobody knows how many\r\nyoung couples the very next Sunday. Unless you have inquired into the\r\nfact, you will hardly believe how many marry just because there is a\r\nhouse ready. We have too many dwellings in proportion to our food.”\r\n\r\n“I have had thoughts already of removing to my new farm some cottages\r\nthat belong to me, and of buying others from the speculators in our\r\nparish funds, who are far too ready to build in our neighbourhood. There\r\nwill be little encouragement for them to build again when all the\r\nsurplus population of the parish is located on my pauper farm, where no\r\nstrangers may intermeddle. You must come and see the ground I have laid\r\nout.”\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson readily agreed to go, but had great doubts about the final\r\nresults of the scheme. This seemed to Mr. Fellowes very strange, as they\r\nagreed upon the extent of relief at present wanted, and upon the\r\ncapability of this farm to supply it.\r\n\r\n“It was you yourself who told me, Jackson, that it is not the whole of\r\nthe people now distressed that it is necessary to relieve. It is only\r\nthe redundancy that we have to take care of.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly: but it should be so relieved as not to produce a further\r\nredundancy.—We have among us, as we agree, sixty labourers more than we\r\nwant. Of these none actually starve, and they therefore deprive some\r\nothers of a portion of necessaries. It appears accordingly that three\r\nhundred are insufficiently fed and clothed because there is a redundancy\r\nof sixty.”\r\n\r\n“Well! my district farm will take off sixty at once, and more\r\nafterwards.”\r\n\r\n“And will therefore produce an immediate relief, restoring to the\r\nremainder of the three hundred their proper share of necessaries; so\r\nwould the emigration of sixty. But mark the difference three generations\r\nhence. Our young people who emigrate carry their descendants with them\r\nto a land where they are wanted. The descendants of your pauper\r\ncultivators must be turned out upon society after all, in greater\r\nnumbers than you now abstract from it. It will be well if the\r\ngrandchildren of your present dependants have not to emigrate at last,\r\nafter the expenditure of much capital that might have been better\r\nemployed, and at a much greater ultimate cost than at present.”\r\n\r\n“You seem to forget, Jackson, that the capital I am laying out is all to\r\nbe reproduced, and that the people on my farm are to work themselves\r\nfree. If any reliance is to be placed on calculations which have been\r\nconducted with the utmost care, if experience is to be trusted, if I may\r\nbelieve what I saw last month with my own eyes in the Belgian colonies\r\n(which it is worth a long journey to see), a good deal more than the\r\ncost of settling my paupers and providing for them will be raised by\r\ntheir labour upon the ground. The best of them will in time repay me,\r\nand go out with money in their pockets to make room for others.”\r\n\r\n“And where are they to go? To carry more labour and new families into a\r\nmarket which is already overstocked. How much easier to remove them at\r\nonce to a labour market where they and their children will be\r\npermanently welcome!”\r\n\r\n“I am for ever met with objections about raising rents and overstocking\r\nthe labour-market,” cried Mr. Fellowes—“I that take no rent, and bind\r\nmyself to employ all the labour!”\r\n\r\n“I said nothing about rent,” replied the clergyman. “I am quite aware\r\nthat a farm like yours, made out of a forced application of capital,\r\nbears no relation to the natural process of rent. But I do not see how\r\nyou can escape the charge of ultimately obliging a portion of society to\r\npay too dear for their food.”\r\n\r\n“What can you mean, when the very essence of my plan is——”\r\n\r\n“Tell me your plan, and then I will tell you my meaning.”\r\n\r\n“My plan is to show, on a small scale, how the charity-funds of this\r\ncountry might be employed productively, and therefore so as to fulfil\r\nthe ends of charity. I would have the unappropriated wastes of Great\r\nBritain, amounting to, some say, 15,000,000 of acres, (and some say much\r\nmore,) set apart to be the People’s Farm. It should be cultivated by\r\nmeans of public funds, say our present poor-rates; and it should be so\r\nportioned out as that every pauper should have the interest of private\r\nproperty in his allotment.—The further internal arrangements should be\r\nmade according to the judgment of the directors. Mine are to be as like\r\nas I can make them to those adopted in the pauper farms in the\r\nNetherlands. Each family shall have its portion of ground and its\r\ncottage, with food and clothing till these can be procured by\r\nthemselves. The soil shall be improved to the utmost by spade-husbandry,\r\nand by preparations of manure requiring more labour than can be devoted\r\nto the object in a general way. The productiveness of the ground being\r\nusually very great under these methods, I expect a considerable surplus\r\nevery harvest; of which a part will go to repay the original expenses,\r\nand a part to set forward the family when they re-enter the world.\r\nMeanwhile, the women and children will spin and weave, and we shall\r\nproduce within our own bounds all that we want. We shall not even need\r\nmoney: for the people will pay one another in commodities.”\r\n\r\n“That is, you are about to carry back a portion of society to a\r\nprimitive condition;—to delving, and a state of barter. If there was no\r\nchoice between the starvation of a number and this state of society, I\r\nmight be brought to look upon it with some degree of complacency: but\r\nwhen other ways are open,—when the question is,—not whether all shall\r\nrelapse into barbarism or some starve,—but whether multitudes shall pass\r\ntheir lives in unassisted digging at home, or a few wander to distant\r\nparts of this fair earth to leave the many in possession of the\r\nblessings of advanced civilization,—I am for applying labour to its\r\nhighest purposes, and for elevating instead of depressing the pursuits\r\nof society. No one doubts that if every hand was employed in tillage\r\nthere would be food enough for all: the question is whether it be not\r\nthus obtained at too great a cost,—every higher pursuit being sacrificed\r\nto it. Only convey to fertile regions abroad the half of those who are\r\neager to go, and there will be abundance of food for all,—and of many\r\nmore things equally essential to the full enjoyment of life. If the\r\nGreeks had not done so, what would have become of all that they did to\r\nenlighten and bless the world? If they had fed their surplus numbers by\r\nemploying more and more in tillage at home, as their numbers increased\r\nand the produce required was greater, there would now have been little\r\nof the philosophy, the literature, the fine arts, which have spread from\r\ntheir country over the world; while, after all, fewer would have lived,\r\nand fewer of the living would have been fed than under their system of\r\nemigration.”\r\n\r\n“They seem indeed never to have thought of the more obvious mode of\r\nproviding for the people. Away they sent them, as fast as they\r\noverflowed their bounds.”\r\n\r\n“Because they were so circumstanced as to perceive at once the fallacy\r\nof the supposed remedies which you and other benevolent persons here are\r\nadvocating. The great body of the people among the Greeks were slaves,\r\nmaintained by masters, and not, as with us, free labourers supported by\r\ntheir own toil. The deficiency of food was there first felt by the\r\nmasters, in the cost of supporting their slaves. Here, it is felt mainly\r\nby the labourers in the fall of the real value of wages. In Greece,\r\nthere was no dispute about the fact, from the moment that food became\r\ndeficient. Here, such a deficiency is even now questioned by multitudes\r\nwho declare that we have not a redundant, but only a poor population;\r\nthat nobody wants food who has enough to give for it; and that therefore\r\nit is money, or work that is wanted, and not food. Such observers give\r\nalms, or pay their poor neighbours for digging holes and filling them up\r\nagain, or doing things equally useless; never dreaming that all the\r\nwhile they are taking food from somebody who has earned it by a better\r\nkind of toil. Such follies as this could never be suggested by the state\r\nof things in Greece; and I see no reason why, because our lower orders\r\nare not slaves, we should not abjure our errors, and adopt such parts of\r\nthe Grecian policy as were wise.”\r\n\r\n“Well, but, the long and short of the matter is this. If the quantity of\r\nfood in Great Britain is too small, cannot it be increased?”\r\n\r\n“To be sure it can. If ten thousand individuals can live this year only\r\nby taking a portion from their neighbours, we may raise as much food in\r\naddition next year as may feed ten thousand people; but if the people at\r\nthe same time increase still faster, how are we better off than we were\r\nbefore?”\r\n\r\n“But cannot we raise enough that year for twenty thousand people instead\r\nof ten thousand, to meet the difficulty? The People’s Farm would admit\r\nof this.”\r\n\r\n“It would: but here the question recurs, whether it will not answer\r\nbetter to send the ten or twenty thousand people where they may obtain\r\nfood at much less cost of toil and capital, and where their descendants\r\nwill not be liable to tax the mother country for food for generations\r\nyet unborn. At home it is only by a considerable sacrifice that the\r\ngrowth of food can be made for any length of time to equal,—or by any\r\nextraordinary effort to outstrip the demands upon it; while, abroad, it\r\nspontaneously keeps ahead of population, and will do so in many parts,\r\ntill men have grown wise enough to regulate population. Our best present\r\npolicy, then, is to send our surplus numbers abroad to eat and prosper,\r\ninstead of obliging more and more of our multitudes to dig at home. It\r\nis on your wish to make them do so much labour for a lesser instead of a\r\ngreater production, that I founded my charge of your ultimately making a\r\npart of society pay too dear for their food.”\r\n\r\n“You mean because labour is the price of food?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and food would be almost as much too dear under your system as\r\nunder the present. At present, the competition for food is so excessive\r\nthat men bid their labour against each other to desperation. Under your\r\npauper-farm system, the same thing would take place in time; and in the\r\nmeanwhile, every bushel of wheat would cost twice or thrice as much\r\nlabour as in Van Diemen’s Land; so that both immediately and ultimately,\r\nyou oblige a certain number to pay higher for their food than they need\r\ndo and therefore ought to do.—And this without taking into consideration\r\nthe change in the proportion of capital to population which is caused by\r\nemigration,—a change most beneficial to the mother country.”\r\n\r\n“And how extensive do you conceive that change to be? There is very\r\nlittle difference between the cost of conveying persons to Van Diemen’s\r\nLand, and settling them on a pauper farm,—too small a difference to\r\nwarrant such an expression as yours.”\r\n\r\n“In addition to this difference, there is all the increase of production\r\nwhich will take place abroad, and which is so much gained to the mother\r\ncountry, since it maintains her people. Besides this, all that would\r\nhave been unproductively consumed by the pauper descendants of these\r\nemigrants may be considered as so much clear gain to the community.\r\nAgain,—the thriving population of our colonies will want more and more\r\nof our manufactures, and will send us their agricultural produce in\r\nexchange; and I suppose you will not question the advantage of investing\r\nour capital in manufactures, and receiving wool and wheat of the best\r\nquality in return, instead of laying it out on lands of inferior\r\nfertility at home, while the people scantily supply themselves with the\r\ncoarse manufactures of their own firesides? You will not question the\r\nduty of availing ourselves of the advantages of division of labour in\r\nthe case of our greatest need? Yet you would, by your plan of home\r\ncolonization, deprive the people of this reciprocity of benefits. You\r\nwould set up new manufactures instead of a new market for them; and all\r\nfor the sake of producing food at a greater cost than under the\r\nemigration system. You are clearly wrong, Fellowes, depend upon it. What\r\na pity that you should not turn your zeal and benevolence and your other\r\nresources to the best account!”\r\n\r\n“The fact is,” replied Fellowes, “that on a matter of so much importance\r\nas this, I am anxious to go on sure ground. I have heard so much on good\r\nauthority of the miseries of emigrants in Canada and elsewhere, and I\r\nhave seen so much with my own eyes of the benefits of the\r\nHome-Colonization system in the Netherlands, that I am induced to do\r\nthat which I know will produce great and immediate good, instead of that\r\nwhose consequences I cannot witness or calculate. I want to give our\r\npoor neighbours food; and I dare not run the risk of having them perish\r\nwith cold and hunger in the woods before they can get any.”\r\n\r\n“If you mix up the abuses of a system with its principles,—if you take\r\nthe conduct of a few ignorant adventurers as an example of what is to be\r\ndone by all emigrants,” continued Mr. Jackson, “I do not wonder at our\r\ndiffering as we do. It is true that too many of our poor neighbours,\r\nheartsick at their condition here, have wandered forth with nothing but\r\nthe clothes on their backs and a hatchet in their hands, without the\r\nguidance and assistance which are necessary to their very lives in a new\r\nclimate and condition of society; but this folly, and the consequent\r\nhardship, have nothing to do with emigration. It is to preclude such\r\nevils that I would have benefactors like you demonstrate to the people\r\nwhat is essential to a successful emigration, and that emigration is\r\nsure to be successful if well conducted. As for its ultimate results,\r\ntime will teach them to all; but you, my dear Sir, with your objects and\r\nyour resources, will be inexcusable if you do not endeavour to\r\nanticipate them. It will be unpardonable in you to adopt a manifestly\r\nshort-sighted policy while the philosophy of principles and the evidence\r\nof facts lie open before you.”\r\n\r\n“Fact is enough for me, romantic as many of my friends think me,”\r\nreplied Fellowes, smiling. “The fact will be, as you will witness, if we\r\nboth live, that two years hence our sixty superabundant labourers with\r\ntheir families will have food without burthening the parish. This is\r\nenough for me.”\r\n\r\n“It will not always be enough. If you should live to see the multiplied\r\ndescendants of these sixty persons either suffering themselves under\r\npauperism, or displacing an equal number from the ranks of employed\r\nlabourers, you may wish that they had been located where there was room\r\nfor all without any arbitrary direction of capital, or factitious\r\nemployment of labour. If, in your old age, you do not witness this, it\r\nwill be because others have repaired your mistake by conveying elsewhere\r\nthe surplus you have created.”\r\n\r\n“If we both live ten years, friend, you shall come and see how I send\r\nforth those who once were paupers, with money in their hands, ready to\r\nestablish themselves reputably in society. There will be nothing in this\r\nto make me repent.”\r\n\r\n“No; your time for repentance will be when each of these monied men\r\nsends two paupers to your gates;—when you find poverty growing up round\r\nyou, which you can relieve,—if at all,—only by a late emigration. I am\r\nsure you will make your confessions to me honestly, if that day should\r\never come.”\r\n\r\n“I will, if you will give me faithful tidings of the Castles, and the\r\nothers who are going with them. Let me hear of all their struggles and\r\ntrials, from the outset till the end.”\r\n\r\n“You shall, as far as I know them myself. Meanwhile, let us help one\r\nanother where we agree. Do you be on the watch to lessen the number of\r\ndwellings as much as you can, and I will use my pastoral influence in\r\ninducing the young folks to delay the publication of their banns till\r\nthey have secured something besides a bare shelter to begin with.”\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                        GOING IN SEARCH OF HOME.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson’s interest in the subject of emigration to Van Diemen’s Land\r\nfirst arose out of his friendship with a gentleman and lady who were\r\nappointed by government to superintend the selection and preparation of\r\nthe young women who were assisted in their settlement in the way already\r\nrelated. His recommendations were received with the confidence naturally\r\nresulting from this intimacy; and he had interest to get arrangements\r\nmade for Frank’s convict brothers to be settled near the rest of the\r\nfamily. In course of time, which seemed very long to impatient paupers,\r\nall was settled. Ellen had a summons to be in London by a certain day,\r\nwith her 8_l._ in her pocket, and a small sum over for the purchase of\r\nsuch necessaries in the way of clothing as should be provided cheap for\r\nher by those who were to receive her, see her safe on board, and furnish\r\nher with a letter to the governor, stating her family circumstances.\r\n\r\nFrank and his parents, with a few more labourers from the parish of A——,\r\nwere to sail in another ship about the same time, proposals having been\r\nsent before them to Van Diemen’s Land, to bind themselves to farmers for\r\na term of years at a certain rate of wages, out of which the parish was\r\nto be repaid for the expenses of their passage and outfit.\r\n\r\nThe outfit was much less expensive in their case than in that of\r\nsettlers in Canada and the western states of America, both because the\r\nclimate of Van Diemen’s Land is more congenial to English constitutions,\r\nand because wearing apparel and other necessaries are much more easy to\r\nbe had there, even if not supplied by settlers as a portion of the wages\r\nof labour. Frank was furnished with a complete set of tools; and the\r\nfamily with a stout suit of clothes each. A stock of plain substantial\r\nprovisions for six months was added, and this was all. There were a few\r\ngrumblers about the last-mentioned article. They thought that the parish\r\nmight, at parting, treat the people with better cheer than they had been\r\naccustomed to; but the parish authorities were wiser. They had heard how\r\nmany lives had been lost on the passage to America from the poor Irish,\r\nwho had been accustomed to nothing better than potatoes, being fed with\r\nan abundance of more stimulating diet, under circumstances which\r\nprevented their taking their usual exercise; and when, from having\r\nnothing to do, they were tempted to eat more than they wanted of good\r\nthings that they could not get at home. The nearer the diet on\r\nship-board resembles that in common use, the better for the health of\r\nthe emigrant; and if he finds himself less disposed to eat than when at\r\nthe hard labour he has been accustomed to, no harm will come of his\r\ntemperance.\r\n\r\nAs the day of departure approached, Frank felt it a positive evil that\r\nevery thing was done for himself and his family by the parish, as too\r\nmuch leisure was left for very unhappy thoughts. He had no idea till the\r\ntime came how much there was to be left behind which even he could not\r\nhelp regretting. He had indeed no beloved cottage to quit, no favourite\r\nstock to sell off, no circle of attached friends and neighbours to say\r\nfarewell to; but he would fain have had such regrets as these to bear,\r\nfor the sake of something to do at the last. He envied his sister at her\r\nneedle, making a gown for her mother when she had finished her own\r\nlinen, while he wandered over the hills that looked towards the sea, or\r\nwatched for the postman who was to bring the final tidings for Ellen, or\r\nstood with his arms folded, silently hearing his father’s murmurs or his\r\nmother’s taunts. He was quite angry with himself for selfishly wondering\r\nwhat he should do with the three days that were to pass between Ellen’s\r\ndeparture and his own, when he ought to be glad that she would be out of\r\nhearing of the uncomfortable sayings that now met her ears continually.\r\n\r\nThe hour came when the young people ought to be setting out to meet the\r\ncarrier’s cart which was to convey Ellen to London. When Frank thought\r\nhe had waited long enough before the door, he went in to look for her,\r\nand found her with her bonnet on, her bundle by her side, and little\r\nSusan on her knee. Her eyes were running over with tears; but she smiled\r\nwhen he tapped her shoulder as a signal that they must go.\r\n\r\n“It seems like a long parting, just because I am going a long way,” said\r\nshe, trying to laugh. “But if we all go to the same place, and there are\r\nmeadows and cows, and the same sort of life we have been accustomed to,\r\nthere is little to mind in going, except Mr. Jackson, to be sure, and\r\ngrandfather, and—and——”\r\n\r\n“Where is father?” asked Frank, distressed at her sobs; “surely he is\r\nnot gone out just now?”\r\n\r\nEllen ran to the door to look about for him, and saw her father leaning\r\nagainst the wall.\r\n\r\n“Where’s your money?” he asked. “You had need take care of money when\r\nyou have got it. All the rest is moonshine, to my thinking.”\r\n\r\n“There is very bright sunshine where we are going, if they all say\r\ntrue,” said Ellen; “and that you will find, father, before a year is\r\nover. You may trust Frank and Mr. Jackson, I am sure; and so——”\r\n\r\n“I trust nobody. I have had enough of trusting people,” cried Castle.\r\n“All this is your doing, remember, both of you; so never cast it up to\r\nme. Go, go. ’Tis getting very late. Where’s your money, I ask you,\r\nchild?”\r\n\r\n“Safe, father, sewed into my stays. But, father, what _can_ happen to us\r\nso bad as living here, as—as—we have done lately?”\r\n\r\n“Go, children, go, and leave off talking about our meeting again at the\r\nother side of the world. If I go to the bottom half-way, Ellen, it will\r\nbe none the worse for you, but the better, except that Frank must go\r\ntoo, and you would not like that so well.”\r\n\r\n“O father——!”\r\n\r\n“Well, one kiss more; and God bless _you_, whatever becomes of me!”\r\n\r\nEllen found her step-mother gossipping with a neighbour as if nothing\r\nwas happening. Her farewell words were few.\r\n\r\n“Goodbye. If I find you an honest woman next time I see you, it’s more\r\nthan I expect, from what people say of the place you are going to. Come,\r\nnow, Frank, don’t be in a passion. Better take care of your sister than\r\nlook so proud about her.”\r\n\r\nFrank now took care of his sister so far as to remove her while she had\r\nstrength to go.\r\n\r\n“O Frank!” she cried, as he put her arm within his own, and led her\r\nrapidly on, “what can there be about me that makes them all talk as they\r\ndo?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing about you, dear, but about the place. It is a dangerous place\r\nfor vain, silly girls; but you need only mind your business, and think\r\nof father and mother, and what we have agreed to do for them, and you\r\nwill do well enough.”\r\n\r\n“And of Mr. Jackson, and grandmother, and how she almost broke my heart\r\nlast night. Look, look! do you see how yonder trees stoop and shiver in\r\nthe churchyard? What a shower of leaves!”\r\n\r\n“’Tis a sudden gust. There have been many such of late.”\r\n\r\n“Just so they went when Molly Shepherd’s funeral was going under them,\r\nand grandmother bade me beware of her shame. ’Tis just like a sign to me\r\nnow! And here comes Mr. Jackson too.”\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson just stopped her to give her a little book as a remembrance,\r\nand to beg her to write to her grandfather, of whom he should inquire\r\nfor her from time to time. It was now really very late.\r\n\r\n“Don’t hurry yourself,” said Frank. “Walk quick if you like, but don’t\r\nbe flurried. I’ll overtake the cart for you, I’ll be bound; and you had\r\nbetter look like yourself as you get in.”\r\n\r\nThe carrier was just cracking his whip to proceed after a halt, when the\r\nbrother and sister made their appearance at the end of the lane. Ellen\r\ncast one glance back upon the familiar spire and hedgerows and cottage\r\nroofs, and summoned up one bright smile and a few more words for Frank.\r\n\r\n“’Tis not as if you were to stay behind, Frank.”\r\n\r\n“To be sure not! Leave every thing to me dear, and be steady and easy,\r\nthat’s all; and don’t talk of Bob and Jerry, for your own sake.—All\r\nright, carrier?—Well then, good bye!”\r\n\r\nAnd high on the hedge stood Frank, gazing long after he had ceased to\r\ndistinguish the bright face looking out at the back of the cart. Not\r\ntill the vehicle had disappeared behind the hill did he descend to the\r\nstubble-field below, and pick up straws, and cut hazel switches like a\r\ntruant boy, muttering to himself “In three days we shall be off.”\r\n\r\nThe second departure was more public and more painful. The two old folks\r\nwould come out at the last moment; and their distress moved the gazers\r\nto an outcry against the cruelty of deserting them, and the unnatural\r\nbehaviour of leaving one’s country and kindred. A giddy young couple\r\nthanked the Castles for vacating their cottage just when others were\r\nwanting one; and of the rest, some who were disappointed of going looked\r\non in silent envy, and others were loud in their reports of the dangers\r\nof the sea, and the horrors of savage life. Frank had seated his charge\r\nin the waggon and walked on, intending to be overtaken out of hearing of\r\nthese busy tongues. He looked back from the first corner, and seeing\r\nthat there was great confusion, returned. Castle was motioning away the\r\nparish officers and Mr. Jackson, and doggedly refusing to go after all.\r\nHis wife was laughing, and little Susan crying.\r\n\r\n“You must please yourself, father,” said he firmly. “If you put yourself\r\nout of the way of being helped by your own children, God help you! I\r\nmust go, and that this moment.”\r\n\r\n“Come along!” cried the wife. “We may as well get out of reach of these\r\nplaguy officers, with their talk of our debt to them. Let’s be off, and\r\nthen they may get their money as they can. We shall never drive our\r\ncarriage here, as they say my boys may do at Botany Bay. Come along!”\r\n\r\nFrank would allow of no force, His father should choose for himself. So\r\nsaid Mr. Jackson.\r\n\r\nWhile he was choosing, a ready pauper jumped into his place, and the\r\nwaggon drove off. Before it had gone two hundred yards, there was a cry\r\nto the driver to stop, the new candidate was turned out grumbling, and\r\nCastle scrambled in. Twenty times during the journey to London, he asked\r\nhow he and his were to pay the seventy pounds required to send them out;\r\nand as often his wife bade him not mind whether it was paid or not; and\r\nFrank assured him that he should not be burdened with debt, if his\r\nchildren lived and prospered. Tears came at last to the unhappy man’s\r\nrelief. As he passed villages and farmsteads where healthy and cheerful\r\nfaces looked up at the waggon as it went by;—as he heard the saw\r\ngrinding in the saw-pit, and the hammering at the forge, he wept at\r\nbeing reminded of his younger and more prosperous days, and at the\r\nthought that while so many were busy and happy in their occupations,\r\nthere was no room for him,—once as hearty in his toil, and now as\r\nwilling to work as any of them. Frank contrived to gather what was in\r\nhis thoughts, and spoke of the saw-pits and forges which are so busy in\r\nthe land they were going to, and of the increased dignity and profit of\r\nsuch occupations in places where artificers are scarce. His own heart\r\nwas ready to sink when he fancied, instead of such a busy region as that\r\nunder his eye, plains and valleys with scarcely a roof visible from end\r\nto end: but every glimpse of a workhouse, every notice by the way-side\r\nabout vagrants, restored his courage, and satisfied him that it was\r\nbest, at all events, to be where, whatever other evils might exist,\r\nthere was no pauperism.\r\n\r\nThe departure of Jerry and Bob took place in a somewhat different style.\r\nA stranger would have fancied there was high holiday in Newgate the day\r\nbefore they went. Parties of convicts from the country arrived, and were\r\nlodged there previous to embarkation, and the larger proportion were\r\nfull of congratulations to one another on their fine prospects. This was\r\ndone in bravado by some, no doubt; and a few looked downcast, and were\r\nlaughed at by their companions for the shame expressed in their\r\ncountenances and manners: but it was actually the belief of most that\r\nthey were lucky fellows to be carried free of expense to a country where\r\nthey should have little to do but get rich as fast as they liked. Two\r\namong them had been transported before, and so wonderful and tempting\r\nwere the tales they had to tell, that they not only found willing\r\nlisteners among criminals wherever they went, but had induced more than\r\none of the present company to commit thefts in order to get transported\r\nand put in fortune’s way. These men, Giles and Green, held forth in all\r\nthe vanity of superior experience, and in all the pride of having\r\ncheated the law; and drew an attentive audience round them while waiting\r\nfor the cart which was to convey the company to the convict-ship.\r\n\r\nBob was leaning rather despondingly against the wall, when his brother\r\nclapped him on the shoulder, and asked him why he looked so black on\r\nthis the grandest day of his life.\r\n\r\n“You should have said ‘thank’ee’ to the judge, Bob, as I did when he\r\nfinished with us; and so you would if you’d known how we were obliged to\r\nhim. We’ll have each a house and servants, and all handsome about us by\r\nthe time we’re one-and-twenty, and meanwhile, there are fine pranks to\r\nbe played. Come and hear Green, about how he and his set got as much rum\r\nin one night as they could drink in a month, and what frolics they had\r\nin the woods, before he took it into his head to come back without\r\nleave.”\r\n\r\nBob shook himself free of his brother, who however would not long let\r\nhim alone.\r\n\r\n“I say, Bob,” he continued, returning, “they call you sulky; and it will\r\nbe the worse for you in the colony if they report you sulky. You may as\r\nwell hear what we are to do when we get there.”\r\n\r\nBob listlessly followed, and took his place among the eager hearers.\r\n\r\n“Bet Turner!” cried one. “What is that she that belonged to Greville’s\r\ngang? She that got transported for shop-lifting?”\r\n\r\n“The same. Well; she has a large white house just out of Sidney, on the\r\nright hand as you go out of Mount-street. Lord! you should see her\r\ndriving out, how grand she looks over her servants, and as well behaved\r\nto her husband as if she had not left another behind her. They say she\r\nsends Turner a bank note every year out of charity. He has married again\r\nto give her satisfaction that he won’t claim her; so they are both\r\ncontent.”\r\n\r\n“Then there is Wilson,” cried Green. “You remember what a poor ragged\r\ncreature he was while he worked like other honest men, for nine\r\nshillings a week. He got sent abroad for the first bad shilling he tried\r\nto pass after he joined us; and all for looking like a bungler at a new\r\ntrick. He worked his way up into a farm of his own in four years, and he\r\nhas got his wife and children over, and is very much respected. But Jack\r\nLawe is the finest fellow of them all. He’s just past thirty, and he is\r\nas rich as a London banker at sixty.”\r\n\r\n“What, he that was within an hour of hanging?”\r\n\r\n“Aye. They looked pretty close to him for a long while; but he is as\r\nsharp in his wits as he is clever at whatever you set him to. He cheated\r\nthem all round, and got himself free in six years, and now you should\r\nsee him out hunting or betting at billiards. He is a good-hearted\r\nfellow, and does not scorn old friends. Many’s the nod and word he has\r\ngiven me from the billiard-room window at Sidney, when I have been\r\npassing, let who would be there. Everybody is glad of the prosperity of\r\nJohn Lawe, Esq.”\r\n\r\nSomebody having made inquiry about the voyage, Green went on,\r\n\r\n“O, that’s the worst part of it. It’s horrid enough, to be sure, to be\r\ncooped up for months on board, and all so solemn and dull, and no\r\ngetting out of the way of the clergyman. But it’s not so bad as it used\r\nto be, when they treated such folks as we like so many wild beasts. They\r\npaid the captain so much a head for the people embarked, and never asked\r\nhow many he landed; so he starved as many as he pleased, and stowed them\r\nso close that scores were stifled by the way. It was mighty dull work\r\nthen for those that got safe; the labour was so hard, and no liberty.\r\nThere was little encouragement to go to the colonies then. But now that\r\nthey don’t kill one by inches by the way, it is worth putting up with\r\nthe passage, for the chance of making one’s fortune at the end of it.”\r\n\r\n“Particularly for them that have friends in power to get fine situations\r\nfor them,” said Jerry pertly. “Bob and I are going to have good care\r\ntaken of us, I hear. But it’s a great plague that the old ones are going\r\nto be spies over us. It will spoil our sport terribly, unless we can\r\nmanage to cut them.”\r\n\r\n“That’s better than having them whining and praying after us all the way\r\nfrom here to the ship, as the old folks mostly do,” said Green. “When I\r\nwent before, my father behaved as if he was following me to the gallows.\r\nHe knows better now. He gave me the wink yesterday for a sharp chap that\r\nknew how to take care of myself. He said,—true enough,—that the worst\r\nblunder I ever made was coming back when once I was well off.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, aye, Green; a certain person knew how to take care of herself as\r\nwell as you. She knew better than to keep herself single five years for\r\nyou. ’Tis a fine feather in her cap to have brought you so far on a\r\nfool’s errand.”\r\n\r\nGreen tried to conceal his visible passion under an appearance of\r\nindifference, while he muttered that a better one than he came for would\r\nfollow him out very soon, if the judge did not baulk them of the\r\nsentence they meant to get pronounced upon her.\r\n\r\n“Here they come, lads!” he cried, interrupting himself. “All is ready:\r\nour carriage at the door! Put a bold face upon it, boys! Now for it!\r\nDon’t have anything to say to the whiners at the gate. Curse all\r\nspoil-sports! Give them three cheers, boys! Hurra! hurra! hurra!”\r\n\r\nAnd gibing, jeering, laughing, shouting, went the batch of convicts\r\nthrough a throng of relatives and former companions, and gazing\r\nstrangers; some of whom were pale and weeping, others signing and\r\nwinking, and more gaping in wonder and pleasure at the scene;\r\nspeculating upon whether the largest share of punishment did not rest\r\nwith those who were left behind. Bob, and one or two other scowlers,\r\nwere almost overlooked in the company of adventurers, who seemed to be\r\ngoing forth merrily to cheat the law, and seek their fortunes in a land\r\nof plenty.\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                               NEW HOMES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEllen was the first of the family that arrived at Hobart Town in Van\r\nDiemen’s Land. Next came the convict-ship, which was sent round to\r\nLaunceston to disembark its passengers; that port being nearer the\r\ndistrict where the convict labour was to be employed. When the batch of\r\nparish emigrants arrived, a fortnight afterwards, Frank found, on\r\napplication to the proper government officer, that his sister had landed\r\nin good health, and had received a high character from the clergyman and\r\nhis lady who had come over as superintendents of the expedition; that\r\nEllen had been forwarded, with a few of her fellow-passengers, to the\r\ndistrict where a service had been procured for her as dairy-maid on a\r\nsettler’s farm; and that care had been taken that her parents and\r\nbrother should be indentured to farmers in the same neighbourhood. So\r\nfar, all was well. Frank could learn nothing about his brothers, except\r\nthat they were to be landed at Launceston, and that Launceston was\r\nwithin thirty miles of the spot where he was to be located. The officer\r\nhe was speaking to had nothing to do with the arrangements respecting\r\nconvicts: his business was to take care of emigrant labourers on their\r\narrival.\r\n\r\nCastle himself could not help being pleased at the appearance of things\r\nat Hobart Town, when he and Frank took a walk, the evening after their\r\narrival. The only objections he could think of were, that there were few\r\nshops; that it was not at all likely that the country inland should be\r\nhalf so civilized as what he saw; and that it was a thing he had not\r\nbeen used to, to have Christmas fall at the hottest time of the year,\r\nand the trees green all the winter through. It was now May; and they\r\ntold him that winter was coming on, and yet that the woods would look as\r\ngreen as now all the time; and that the snow, if there was any, would\r\nnot lie more than a day on any ground but the mountain tops, and a bleak\r\ncommon here and there. They told him that for more than three hundred\r\ndays in the year the sun would shine all day, and the air be dry and\r\npure, and seldom too hot or too cold. All this was what he had not been\r\nused to, and did not know how to believe. His son supposed that if it\r\ncame true, he would not object; as one of the consequences of such a\r\nclimate is that English people have much better health, and live, on the\r\naverage, a good deal longer at Van Diemen’s Land than at home. Castle\r\npeevishly laughed at all talk about life and health, when it was, in his\r\nopinion, doubtful whether they might not be starved to death within\r\nthree months. His son left this point to be demonstrated by time rather\r\nthan by argument; and meanwhile observed that there were few signs of\r\nstarvation about Hobart Town, in which, besides the government\r\nresidence, there are nearly eight hundred houses, most of which are\r\nsurrounded with gardens; the dwellings having been originally built on\r\nseparate allotments of land, of a quarter of an acre each. The streets\r\ncross at right-angles, and command fine views of the neighbouring\r\ncountry, and afford cheering evidences of the success of the industry\r\nwhich has sought employment there. A dock-yard is seen on the river’s\r\nbrink; and corn-mills, tanneries, breweries, a hat-manufactory, &c., are\r\nconspicuous in the midst of the town. An amphitheatre of green hills\r\nrises to the westward, the crowning summit of which is 4000 feet high;\r\nand from these hills descends a fine stream of water, flowing through\r\nthe town into the Derwent, which, with its varying expanse and\r\nbeautifully wooded bays and sloping shores, forms the eastern boundary.\r\nThis view was little enough like what Castle had fancied in opposition\r\nto all that he had been told. He was for ever picturing to himself a\r\nregion of wild woods, or bleak plains covered with snow; and he was now\r\nas much surprised at the sight of meadows, hills, dales, and a thriving\r\ntown, with a blue sky overhead, as if he might not have known as much\r\nbefore. He had complained of his hard lot in being indentured as a\r\nshepherd; and no wonder, while he thought his flocks were to inhabit a\r\ndreary wilderness; but now that he found he had nothing to fear from\r\nstorms and snow-drifts, that the pastures were excellent, the springs\r\nplentiful, and the sheep as fine as the world can produce, he began to\r\nthink he might be worse off in point of occupation; though he would give\r\nnobody the satisfaction of hearing him say so. His wife was to be a\r\ndomestic servant in the same farm where he was shepherd; and even little\r\nSusan was carefully stipulated for; the labour of children being\r\nvaluable at almost any age, in a place where much more assistance is\r\nwanted than can be had.\r\n\r\nThe first part of their journey to the Dairy Plains, (the district where\r\nthey were to settle,) was through the very choicest portion of the\r\nisland, both as to beauty and fertility. It is not surprising that those\r\nwho first surveyed this tract, and took it as a fair sample of the\r\nisland at large, should have represented Van Diemen’s Land as a\r\nterrestrial paradise, and been suspected of exaggeration through the\r\nfavourableness of their report. The fact is, the island is supposed to\r\ncontain about 15,000,000 acres,—one-third of which is considered arable,\r\nanother third fit for sheep-pasture, and the rest unprofitable at\r\npresent. The country between Hobart Town and Launceston consists of\r\ngreen hills and fertile plains, among which towns and villages and\r\nsolitary dwellings are interspersed. Rivers wind between their wooded\r\nbanks, and streams flow down from the high grounds. Excellent\r\nmacadamized roads run through the whole district, and branch off to the\r\ngrowing settlements on either hand of the main track. It was a great\r\namusement to Frank to compare whatever he met with that partook of the\r\ncivilization of his own country with whatever looked new and strange.\r\nBefore leaving Hobart Town, he had been all the more struck with its\r\nprinting establishments, its Mechanics’ Institute, its Book Society, and\r\nschools, from observing the strangeness of the natural productions that\r\nhe met at every step. In the gardens he beheld tea trees where he had\r\nbeen accustomed to see lilacs and laburnums; and cotton plants, myrtles,\r\nand geraniums growing as tall as himself, and spreading out into bushes.\r\nThe very grass grows differently;—not stringy in the roots and\r\ncarpetlike in the surface, as in England; but in tufts. Parrots, instead\r\nof canaries, were the pets of young ladies; and the bandicoot was\r\noffered for sale instead of the rabbit. Cockatoos instead of crows were\r\nto be frightened away from the fields and gardens; and flocks of pigeons\r\namong the stubble looked as much like partridges as pigeons; only more\r\nbeautiful,—with their gold-dropped wings,—than either species in\r\nEngland. On the road, in like manner, the freestone bridge over the\r\nJordan, the postman on horseback, the tillage and inclosures, looked\r\nBritish; but the evergreen woods, in the midst of which arose the\r\npeppermint tree to a lofty height;—the herds of kangaroos coming out of\r\ntheir covert into the dewy plains at sunrise;—the spotted opossums\r\nclimbing and descending the forest trees;—the black swans sailing on the\r\nlakes, and uttering cries like the creaking of an old sign-board;—all\r\nappeared foreign, and scarcely belonging to the people who had settled\r\namong them.\r\n\r\nA sight of a yet different character met the eyes of the travellers near\r\nthe close of the second day, when they were drawing near their future\r\nabode in the province called Norfolk Plains, in the centre of which lay\r\nthe Dairy Plains, where Ellen was expecting them. They had for some time\r\nquitted the broad road, and were following a track along which their\r\nwaggon proceeded with tolerable convenience. At last they came to a\r\npoint beyond which it had not been carried, and where a gang of\r\nlabourers was at work roadmaking;—not as in England, each man intent\r\nupon his own heap of stones, free in limb and thoughtful in\r\ncountenance;—not as in Ireland, where some are lounging and all are\r\njoking;—but charged with the fetters of felons, and superintended by an\r\narmed taskmaster. As Frank looked upon these wretches, with their\r\nhardened or woful countenances, he felt indeed that he was not in\r\nEngland, but in one of her penal settlements,—breathing the air of one\r\nof the places where her vice and misery are deposited. His very soul\r\nbecame sick when, as the labourers turned to stare at the somewhat\r\nuncommon sight of a waggon full of travellers, he met the eyes of his\r\nconvict brothers. He hoped that his companions would not perceive them;\r\nbut he soon found that his father did, by his testy complaints of the\r\njolting of the cart, of cold and heat, and what not. The unhappy mother\r\nlooked on her outcast children with as much curiosity as compassion. Bob\r\nturned away, and stooped to his work, never looking up till they were\r\nout of sight; but Jerry waved his cap and shouted, and dared Frank to a\r\nwager which of them would first be free to work for themselves: whether\r\nit would take longest to work out his sentence, or to pay for Frank’s\r\npassage and settlement. This supplied a new theme of complaint to\r\nCastle, who wrought himself up into a passion about his being a slave,\r\nwith all his family. Frank, who hated bondage as much as any man,\r\nthought it could hardly be called slavery to contract to work for one\r\nperson for a certain time, in return for advantages which could not\r\notherwise be obtained. If disappointed of these advantages,—of\r\nsufficient food, clothing, shelter, and money wages,—the contract was\r\nvoid, and no harm done; if not disappointed, the object was gained. The\r\nevil lay, not in their case as labourers; but as honest men. Felons\r\nought not to be let off so easily, (because their labour happened to be\r\nmore valuable than at home,) as to make disgrace, for which many of them\r\ndid not care, their only punishment; their worldly circumstances being\r\nactually bettered by their removal to a new colony. It was not that\r\nlabourers need be better off than their family would probably be, four\r\nor five years hence; but that felons ought not to be placed in as good\r\ncircumstances as the honest emigrant at the end of the same period.\r\n\r\nFrank was not yet aware (as he afterwards became) that, for want of\r\nknowing the rate of wages at the colonies, emigrants often bind\r\nthemselves for a much lower rate than they might obtain if they went\r\nfree, or if they were properly informed of the existing state of things;\r\nand thus think themselves deceived, and are tempted to break their\r\ncontract when they find how matters stand. This evil is to be referred\r\nto the ignorance of emigrant labourers, quite as much as to the close\r\neconomy of the settlers, and should induce all who have heard of it to\r\nobtain such information before concluding their bargain as will save\r\nthem from repentance afterwards, and guard them against quarrels on this\r\nscore with their new masters;—quarrels, which, always a great evil, are\r\nmost so in newly settled countries, where all hands and hearts are\r\nwanted to work together for the common good. As it is, a British artisan\r\njumps at the offer of a plentiful subsistence and 2_s._ a-day besides\r\nfor five years, out of which the expenses of his removal are to be paid;\r\nand for this rate he binds himself. When he gets to his destination, he\r\nfinds that this plentiful subsistence, including meat, bread, beer or\r\nspirits, tea, sugar, comfortable clothing, and a convenient dwelling,\r\ncosts no more than 2_s._ a-day, and that, if free, he might earn, being\r\na good workman, from 7_s._ to 12_s._ a-day, or even 15_s._, if he be a\r\nsuperior mechanic of a scarce class. It is mortifying to find that he\r\nhas sold himself, however much higher than formerly, for less than he is\r\nworth in his new position; and hence arise discontents which embitter\r\nthe first years of his new life, if they do not occasion a breach of\r\ncontract. The friends of a rational plan of emigration should do their\r\nutmost to make known to as many as it may concern, to what extent labour\r\nis wanted in the colonies,—what is the rate of money wages in each, and\r\nwhat those money wages will procure. The official information on these\r\npoints transmitted from Van Diemen’s Land in 1827, was, that common\r\nlabourers earn 3_s._ per day; common mechanics 7_s._; better mechanics,\r\nfrom 8_s._ to 12_s._; best ditto, from 12_s._ to 15_s._; and persons of\r\npeculiar qualifications, fitted to superintend farms or other\r\nundertakings, 1_l._ a-day. Since that time, wages are understood to have\r\nrisen. The price of wheat is 7_s._ a bushel; meat, 2_d._ or 3_d._ per\r\nlb.; sugar, from 3_d._ to 6_d._; and tea, from 1_s._ 6_d._ to 4_s._ per\r\nlb.—No wonder that, amidst all their gratitude at being well provided\r\nfor, many such workmen as Frank are vexed and mortified to find how much\r\nmore they might have made of their labour.\r\n\r\nFar other feelings, however, than those of discontent were awakened in\r\nFrank by the aspect of his new abode. It was almost in a state of\r\nnature, his employer, Mr. Stapleton, having preceded him to take\r\npossession only a few days before: but it was far from being a desolate\r\nspot in the midst of a waste, as settlers’ farms are wont to be in\r\ncolonies where the unwise object is to disperse the inhabitants, instead\r\nof bringing them near to enjoy the advantages of a division of labour\r\nand reciprocity of consumption. The Dutch government at the Cape of Good\r\nHope formerly forbade settlers to approach within three miles of each\r\nother; and thus effectually prevented the full improvement of the land,\r\nthe construction of roads, and the opening of a market for exchanges.\r\nHence the Dutch settlers at the Cape are to this day deprived of many\r\nadvantages of civilized life. They have too much of whatever they grow,\r\nand too little of what they would fain buy; and are debarred the\r\ncomforts of society and mutual help. These evils are likely to be\r\navoided by the method of disposing of land now adopted by our government\r\nin Australia; the land being sold on terms which make it the interest of\r\nthe settler to improve his tract, and to take advantage of a\r\nneighbourhood which may relieve him of some of his produce. Mr.\r\nStapleton, having been obliged to choose his land carefully, and to pay\r\n9_s._ an acre for it, (instead of 6_d._, or nothing at all, like some of\r\nthe earlier inhabitants,) was not tempted to wander away into the\r\nwilderness, and sit down where he might happen to like the prospect, or\r\nto be smitten with some new discovery of fish-ponds, woods, and meadows.\r\nHe made his choice instead among the lands of a certain district; and\r\nselected such, as to extent and quality, as would on the whole best suit\r\nhis purposes, in conjunction with the privileges of a neighbourhood. His\r\nland, though not of the very first quality, was good enough to have\r\nfetched 15_s._ per acre, if it had lain somewhat more to the north or\r\neast, where the country was rapidly becoming better peopled; but it\r\nstretched towards the unoccupied districts at the foot of the western\r\nmountains, and was less valuable than if it had been surrounded by\r\ncivilization, instead of only bordering upon it.—It consisted,—not of\r\njungle and forest ground, where room must be made by the axe before seed\r\ncould be sown and sunshine visit it; but of a lightly timbered and\r\nundulating surface of grass land, wanting only a single burning to\r\nrender it fit for the plough, or for a new growth of pasture. The trees\r\nwere not of the nature of copse and thicket; but growing in clumps a\r\nhundred feet apart, and with clear stems, measuring ninety feet or more\r\nto the lowest branch; thus affording spots for shade and shelter without\r\ninterfering with tillage. The boundaries, where not formed by natural\r\nstreams, were fixed by marking the trees; and there was no immediate\r\nneed of fences where neither man nor beast was likely to trespass, and\r\nwhere there was at present no live stock that could be in danger of\r\nstraying. No one was near who could be tempted to steal; for none were\r\npoor. The wild cattle, which in former days did great mischief on the\r\ngrounds of the settler, had long ago been driven among the mountains,\r\nwhere it was supposed the race had died out, as none now appeared. The\r\nfew oxen and horses that Stapleton brought with him were kept near the\r\ndwelling; and the rest of the stock was not to follow till all was in\r\nreadiness for its reception. A rude shed had been hastily constructed\r\nfor shelter, under a clump of trees; and a few sawn planks were lying\r\nabout: by which Frank saw that the materials of his business were ready\r\nfor him to begin upon without delay. Tools and utensils were stowed away\r\nin corners, or heaped under the trees, till their proper places were\r\nprovided for them; and a goodly row of casks and packages of provision\r\nstood in the background. Frank had believed that his spirit of\r\nenterprise had died within him under the hardships of his own country;\r\nbut he now felt it revive in a moment; and was anything but dismayed at\r\nthe prospect of what he had to do in his capacity of carpenter, before\r\nthe scene before him could put on the appearance of a snug and\r\nwell-managed farmstead. He saw in fancy the day when a little hamlet of\r\nweather-boarded cottages would be sending up their blue smoke among\r\nthose trees; when cattle-sheds and sheep-pens would stretch out behind\r\nthe dwellings, and the busy forge and creaking timber-wain would drown\r\nthe cry of the quail, and scare away the kangaroos that were now leaping\r\nover the plains. He did not forget to add a very superior workshop and\r\ntimber-yard to his picture of his own dwelling; or to imagine his father\r\nlooking down from among his flock on the hills, or Ellen within sight,\r\ngoing forth in the bright early morning with her milk-pail.\r\n\r\nAs if to answer to his thought, Ellen now appeared. She had stolen half\r\nan hour to run in search of Mr. Stapleton, to ask once more how soon he\r\nthought Frank might possibly arrive. Mr. Stapleton was almost as eager\r\nfor the event as herself; but he knew no more, and was just dismissing\r\nher, disappointed, when the waggon was heard approaching. While she\r\nwaited a moment, straining her sight to make out whether it was the\r\nright party, before she ran to meet them, her brother jumped out, and\r\neven Castle started up with more alacrity than he had shown since they\r\nlanded. Before they could well greet one another, Stapleton came up to\r\nask where Frank’s tools were, and to tell him that he was wanted very\r\nmuch indeed. He could not refuse him permission to go forward one mile,\r\nin order to deposit Castle and his wife at their new abode; but he lent\r\na hand towards emptying the waggon of his workman’s packages, and gave\r\nhim notice that he should be glad to see him back the first possible\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n“You will soon find what great people such as we are here,” said Ellen,\r\nlaughing. “This is the place to grow proud in. No more lounging about\r\nthe fields, Frank; no more leaning over gates chewing straws, while\r\nnobody inquires for one. You will never need to touch your hat and ask\r\nfor work here; people will come begging you to be so very kind as to put\r\nup a door for any pay you please. This is the place to grow proud in.”\r\n\r\nFrank observed, with a grave smile, that pride was dangerous to one in\r\nEllen’s place.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, I will be proud of you, and you shall be proud of me; and\r\nno harm can come of that.”\r\n\r\nThe first time that the brother and sister could obtain a few minutes’\r\nconversation without being overheard, Frank inquired,\r\n\r\n“Now, Ellen, tell me straight forward. How do you like your change?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I more than half like it; but there are some things I do not\r\nlike.—It is a fine thing to be so well off, and to know that I shall be\r\nso: and I do not mind the work, though it is rather hard, to be sure;\r\nand my cows are nothing but a credit to me, and I have seen no animals\r\nto be afraid of when I go out milking, though some of them leap about\r\nvery strangely indeed; and my mistress makes much of me, as I told you;\r\nand her little worries are not much to be wondered at when one thinks of\r\nthe confusion we live in just now; and I dare say there will be an end\r\nof them when we get our soap and candles made out of the house, and\r\nanother hand or two to help in the brewing and washing. And then to\r\nthink that father and you are so well off——”\r\n\r\n“But tell me what there is that you do not like.”\r\n\r\nEllen almost shuddered when she whispered that her fellow servant, who\r\nate at the same table, and slept in the same room, and was her companion\r\nalmost all day, was a convict, and had been sent to this country for\r\nrobbing an aged mistress who had confided in her, and deserved gratitude\r\ninstead of treachery from her. To be compelled to hold daily and hourly\r\nintercourse with such a person was a very great evil, and one which\r\ndoubled Frank’s anxiety about his sister. He was glad to hear that there\r\nwas a probability of the woman marrying as soon as she could obtain a\r\nremission of her servitude by steady conduct.\r\n\r\nA half smile which he perceived on Ellen’s lips when this part of the\r\nstory was being told, made him question her further respecting the evils\r\nof her situation, or the trials which she might not be disposed to\r\nconsider exactly as evils. The idea in her mind was that which he\r\nsuspected,—that she might quit her service before her convict\r\ncompanion.—Frank looked graver than ever. Who—what—where was he,—the\r\nperson that seemed to have made advances in Ellen’s good graces already?\r\nShe was eager to explain that there was no one in particular yet. It was\r\ntoo early for her to have looked about and settled her mind yet;—but\r\nthere was this one, and that one, and the other one, that carried her\r\npail for her, morning and evening, however busy he might be; or was\r\nready to teach her how to clean and card wool; or showed her what a\r\npretty little homestead he was about to have in the neighbourhood, and\r\nintimated how happy she might be as the mistress of it.\r\n\r\n“They hinder my work sadly, and their own too,” continued she, blushing,\r\n“for all I tell them that I have nothing to say to any body yet. I am so\r\nafraid any of them should have been convicts, (though I am sure Harry\r\nMoore never was;) and I dare not ask mistress any thing about them.”\r\n\r\n“Ask her, by all means,” said Frank. “Or I will ask your master, if you\r\nwish it. They only can tell us, and it is a point we must find out.\r\nMeantime, keep to your business as quietly as you can. What makes you so\r\nsure that Moore (is not that his name?) was never a convict?”\r\n\r\nEllen could give no better reason than that she could wager her life\r\nupon it. She thought her brother grown very pertinacious on a sudden,\r\nbecause this was not perfectly satisfactory to him; but Frank was not\r\npertinacious—only wary and affectionate.\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                          THE CASTLES AT HOME.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was very well for a man of Castle’s irritable temper to be made a\r\nshepherd, instead of a labourer at home, within sight and hearing of all\r\nthe bustle and difficulty occasioned by much pressure of work and few\r\nhands to do it. He could not have borne to be, as his wife said, driven\r\nfrom pillar to post,—called off from one thing before he had done it, to\r\ndo something else to which he was altogether unaccustomed. It suited him\r\nmuch better to be out upon the downs after the sheep; though even in\r\nthat quiet place he had his troubles. The sheep-walk was too extensive\r\nto be under the management of one person; and Castle’s brother-shepherd\r\nwas not a very congenial companion. He was a gentleman convict;—a young\r\nman who had gamed away his little fortune, and then taken to swindling,\r\nfor which he had been transported. Being unequal to hard work, and\r\nhaving no mechanical skill, he was sent out to tend sheep; an employment\r\nas little suitable as might be to his social dispositions and active\r\nhabits. The two reluctant companions agreed only in their inclination to\r\ngrumble.\r\n\r\n“They call this a fine scene,” observed the young man, “but it does not\r\nsuit my taste. I had rather see our sheep in the Smithfield pens than on\r\nthese downs. Then one misses the London cries, however much the magpies\r\nchatter here. As for the cooing of the doves, it really depresses the\r\nspirits. People talk of the stars being so brilliant here,—like golden\r\nlamps; but I like real lamps better. A row of them in Pall Mall is worth\r\na hemisphere of stars.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know much about lamplight,” replied Castle, “having been too\r\npoor to burn candles at home, and so going to bed in the twilight; but\r\nthis place is so lonesome, I sometimes wonder whether it is in the world\r\nor out of it. All this view is like an old deserted park, to be sure;\r\nbut where is the squire’s house, or the church steeple, and the children\r\ncoming out of school? There is no public-house far or near; and no\r\nparson or his lady to speak a word to one: only a young man that comes\r\nto read prayers on Sundays in a shed or on the green, and away again to\r\ndo the same thing somewhere else. Not such a thing have I seen since I\r\ncame as a carriage with ladies in it; and they say there are no hunts.\r\nWith all the game there is here, no scarlet jackets ever come in sight\r\nfrom the woods.”\r\n\r\n“That is the worst of it,” responded the other grumbler. “We have all\r\nthe dulness of a country life without its solace of amusement. It was\r\nreally too tantalizing lately, to see a kangaroo hunt which I could not\r\njoin. If they would let me take my turn, I might be of some use to them\r\nas an experienced huntsman. I should like to hunt opossums till I could\r\nget skins enough to make your pretty daughter a cloak worthy to be worn;\r\nand——”\r\n\r\nCastle here moved off impatiently, having too much paternal pride to\r\nlisten to convict wooing on Ellen’s behalf. The young man followed him,\r\ncontinuing,\r\n\r\n“The snipe-shooting is very choice, I’m told, in the marshes yonder. I\r\nmust have leave when winter comes on, to go and try my luck. But the\r\nhunts are the best things,—more spirited perhaps than you are aware of.”\r\n\r\n“Hunts! hunts!” cried Castle. “I see neither deer nor fox. An odd sort\r\nof hunting, if you mean killing any of these leaping things, with their\r\nqueer ways. Why, the little ones don’t run beside their dams, as is\r\nnatural, but she pops them into her bag, and off she hops, as if she had\r\nonly two legs. The first I saw, I thought she had happened an accident,\r\nand had her fore legs cut short; and I thought she got on wonderfully\r\nwell considering; and then in a minute appeared a whole herd of them,\r\nwith their young in their bags.”\r\n\r\n“It is a pretty sight to see them come down from the woods at sunrise to\r\nfeed in the plains. Then is the time to hide behind a thicket, and make\r\nsure of one’s game. Which do you prefer, as a bottom dish, kangaroo or\r\nbandicoot? In a pie, properly seasoned, it is difficult to say which is\r\nthe best. I have given many a hint down below that either is much more\r\npalatable to me than rations of salt meat.”\r\n\r\nCastle, who thought no man need desire more in the way of diet than to\r\neat meat every day, looked with contempt on the grimaces of his\r\ncompanion over his ample supply of beef, wheaten bread, and cider.\r\n\r\n“If you want to hunt,” said Castle, “I wish you would kill off the vile\r\nbeasts that have been making havoc among my lambs. I might have got at\r\none, but I was downright scared with its ugliness.”\r\n\r\n“Was it the hyena or the devil?”\r\n\r\n“O, the devil, to judge by its looks. It is as big as a middle-sized\r\ndog, with the head of an otter, crowded with teeth. It moved very slow,\r\nbut I could do no better than stare at it.”\r\n\r\n“They call it the devil here,” replied the gentleman. “You should dig\r\nlittle pits, and set your dogs upon it when it has fallen in. It will go\r\non worrying your lambs, unless you keep on the watch.”\r\n\r\n“Another thing that puts me out,” observed Castle, “is that the beasts\r\nare one below another here, as if they were bewitched. In England, we\r\nhave a horse of one size, and a dog of another, and a rat of another;\r\nand none of them is like the rest; but here we have a big kangaroo, and\r\na kangaroo the size of a dog, and another no bigger than a rat; and\r\nthese last are not real kangaroos. I declare it makes my hair stand up\r\nto see a rat leaping like a real kangaroo: just as it would to see a\r\nmouse shaking its mane and trotting and cantering like a horse. I have\r\nnot been used to such freaks, and this is a country I can’t understand.”\r\n\r\n“I hope to understand it better,” replied the convict. “I was always\r\nfond of roving, and in time I may have explored farther than we can see\r\nfrom these green hills that we both find so dull. What do you mean to do\r\nwhen you get free?”\r\n\r\n“They may settle that that got me bound,” replied Castle, testily. Then,\r\nstruck with a sense of his own ingratitude, he added, “To be sure, if\r\nthere is no squire’s house, there is no workhouse either; and if I see\r\nno acquaintance, there is nobody to taunt me with misfortune; but, on\r\nthe contrary, they make much of me at home. And there’s——”\r\n\r\n“Your daughter.”\r\n\r\n“What; my little Susan! Yes, they make a handy little thing of her\r\nalready, and——”\r\n\r\n“I mean the other handy one, Ellen.”\r\n\r\n“She will do well enough, Sir, I assure you. She has a fine spirit and a\r\nsteady mind of her own, and a proud brother to take care of her; and\r\nthat is better than a broken-down father; though it should go hard with\r\nme but I would protect her, Sir, if there was no one to do it better.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, Castle walked off, showing by his manner that he was not\r\nsociably disposed.\r\n\r\nHis wife was much more altered within a short time by her change of\r\ncircumstances than he. The first thing that seemed to affect her\r\nfavourably was the use that was made of her little daughter in the\r\nhousehold arrangements. When the farmer’s wife found that her new\r\ndomestic was indolent and indifferent, she endeavoured to make the best\r\nof a poor bargain by squeezing as much work as she could out of Susan.\r\nThe child was willing enough, and proud to find herself of so much use;\r\nbut her mother was jealous on her account, and began for the first time\r\nto show symptoms of tenderness for her. She not only argued in her\r\ndefence, but helped her when she was more disposed to proceed with her\r\nwork than to “go and play;” words which had little charm for a child\r\nwhose associations with play were those of hunger, scolding, mockery,\r\nand all the miseries of pauper life. When the farm servants rose at\r\ndaybreak to go forth for the day, Susan was always ready to jump up at\r\nthe first word, to replenish the wallets and fill the cans, though her\r\nmother turned round in bed, and muttered that it was too soon to get up.\r\nShe needed no reminding about tending the house-lamb, and feeding the\r\npoultry, and dusting as much of the coarse furniture as she could reach.\r\nAfter breakfast, if any one would lift her upon the dresser, or lay the\r\nutensils and the bowl of water on the floor, she would wash up without\r\nbreaking anything: and she was always at hand to carry messages into\r\nfield or farm-yard, or to help with dinner and supper, or to carry\r\nletters to the spot where they were to be deposited in readiness for the\r\npostman’s weekly call; and when not able to do anything better, she\r\ncould scare away the crows and cockatoos from the fields and garden. Her\r\nmother thought this a hard life for a little girl: but Susan was stout,\r\nrosy, and merry; and the farmer himself found a few minutes now and then\r\nto take her on his knee and teach her the alphabet, in preparation for\r\nthe time when a schoolmaster could be brought within reach. The first\r\nthing Mrs. Castle did heartily was washing up, one day when Susan had\r\nnearly scalded her fingers. She took more and more of the child’s work\r\nfrom her, and still Susan turned to something else; so that ere long,\r\nboth were pretty fully employed; and in proportion as the once reckless\r\nand lazy pauper became interested in the occupations going on around\r\nher,—in proportion as she bestirred herself to get the baking done while\r\nthe house was clear of the men, and the washing over in time to have a\r\nchat in the evening,—she grew like the active and tidy housewife she\r\nwould never have become in her own land.\r\n\r\nA circumstance which hastened this change was the opportunity she now\r\nhad of gratifying one taste,—almost the only taste she ever had, and\r\nwhich seemed to have died out under the hardships of her condition: a\r\ntaste for gardening. When a girl, she had had a garden; and as long as\r\nher husband had owned an acre of ground, she took possession of a corner\r\nof it for her pinks and roses, under pretence of growing vegetables for\r\nthe family. From that time to this, nobody had heard her mention fruit\r\nor flowers; but Ellen bore in mind her love for them now when the\r\nremembrance might be turned to some purpose. She mentioned, in her\r\nstep-mother’s presence, that her master was trying what he could do in\r\nthe management of vines, for the growth of which the climate was\r\npeculiarly favourable; and that whether he got any wine or not, his\r\ntrouble would be more than repaid by his profits from his other fruits.\r\nThe peaches, to be sure, were not of the best sort, though so plentiful\r\nas to lie rotting on the ground, after bushels had been thrown to the\r\npigs; but the apricots, and yet more the raspberries, which grew to such\r\na size and in such quantity as no English person would believe without\r\nseeing them, were likely to prove a good speculation, being sent to a\r\ndistance in the form of jam. Sugar being remarkably cheap in this\r\ncountry, there was little risk in trying a batch of sweetmeats, which\r\nwere to be sent to India for sale by a vessel from Launceston. The idea\r\nwas caught up as Ellen expected it would be; and as the farmer and his\r\nwife did not take to the scheme of fruit-growing as heartily as was\r\ndesired, the emigrant family tried whether they could not get a garden\r\nof their own. The small part of their wages which they were yet at\r\nliberty to use was applied to the purchase of a plot of ground, and\r\nFrank found time to work in it, and Ellen procured wherewith to stock\r\nit, and their step-mother haunted it early and late, before and after\r\nwork,—and Castle himself relaxed his brow, and spoke in a tone that was\r\nnot querulous, as he looked round upon that which, however small, was so\r\nmuch more than he had ever expected to possess again,—a family property.\r\n\r\n“Look at father,” whispered Ellen to her brother. “I have not seen him\r\nand her arm-in-arm since I was no bigger than Susan.”\r\n\r\n“He is like a prisoner that has been quite shut up coming for the first\r\ntime into the gaol court,” said Frank. “The feel of the air makes him\r\npush his hat up from over his eyes. Only set him quite free, and he will\r\nuncover his brows, and lift up his head like a man.”\r\n\r\n“And so he ought,” replied Ellen, “since it is for no fault of his own\r\nthat he has been bound down to poverty.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! poverty is a cold and dreary prison, Ellen. That puts me in\r\nmind,—have you seen, I wonder, any thing that has surprised you very\r\nmuch lately,—any thing that you would like to tell me if you were sure\r\nof not being overheard, or of not being thought fanciful?”\r\n\r\n“The word ‘prison’ put me in mind of something that I have been wanting\r\nto talk to you about almost this month past.—I don’t know how to believe\r\nmy own eyes about it, but I am sure I have seen Jerry in our farm-yard\r\nat night, and lurking about among the sheds before most of our folks are\r\nstirring in the morning.”\r\n\r\n“Aye; but was he all alone, Ellen?”\r\n\r\n“Bob was never with him, that I could see; but he seemed to me to be\r\nwaiting for somebody off our premises, and I thought it must naturally\r\nbe me. So twice I ran out to catch him; but once I was crossed by two of\r\nour people that I don’t choose to come in the way of; and the other time\r\nhe was whispering with the same two, so that I dared not go near. How\r\ncould he get liberty? and what could he be about?”\r\n\r\n“Something very deep, I am afraid,” replied her brother. “As to the\r\nliberty,—it is no difficult matter for convicts who behave pretty\r\nregularly to get hours of liberty at the beginning and end of the day;\r\nand the lads being employed on roadmaking so near, accounts for our\r\ngetting a glimpse of them sometimes. But what I am uneasy about is\r\nJerry’s having so much to say to the convicts at your place and\r\nmine;—for I have seen him at Stapleton’s oftener than you have among\r\nyour people. I am afraid of some plot——”\r\n\r\n“O, mercy!” cried Ellen; “what sort of a plot?”\r\n\r\n“That is more than I can say. Sometimes they plot, I hear, for nothing\r\nworse than to escape; but some have had to do with the natives, (who are\r\nlittle better than wild beasts), and have brought them down upon the\r\nfarms, setting them to steal and even to murder; for which they pay the\r\npoor savage creatures by helping themselves with their wives.”\r\n\r\nEllen trembled while she asked whether any of the natives could be in\r\nthe neighbourhood.—Her brother hoped not, as the government had declared\r\nthat they were driven back among the mountains, where they must soon die\r\nout as their wild cattle had done: but as long as any convicts were\r\ndisposed to bush-ranging,—and some did actually escape every year,—he\r\ncould not, for his part, feel quite secure. He thought he should speak\r\nto Stapleton about it. Meanwhile, he desired Ellen to drop not a\r\nsyllable that should alarm her father, or anybody else.\r\n\r\n“I hope, sister,” he continued with some hesitation, “I hope Harry Moore\r\nhas no acquaintance, more or less, with Jerry, or any other such\r\npeople.”\r\n\r\nEllen’s eyes flashed as they used to do when she was a passionate little\r\ngirl at school.\r\n\r\n“Harry!” she cried. “Harry Moore have any sneaking doings! Harry Moore\r\nkeep bad company! You don’t know Harry a bit better than the very first\r\nday,—the day when you thought he might be a convict himself.”\r\n\r\n“No need to be angry, Ellen. He might just know him enough, you see, to\r\nsay ‘How d’ye do?’ when they meet, and to judge how often Jerry might\r\nfairly be here.”\r\n\r\n“After all,” said Ellen, sighing, “it is my father’s own son that I flew\r\noff about his being acquainted with; so there is no need for me to be so\r\nproud. No; Harry does not know either of the lads, even by sight; but I\r\nshall tell him what you have been saying, though nobody else, Frank.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. Conceal nothing that weighs upon your mind from Harry, any\r\nmore than if he was your husband already. I look to him to help me to\r\nkeep an eye upon Bob, who may be made something of, they say, little\r\nhope as there is for Jerry. Bob works within bounds at spare hours,\r\ninstead of roving into the bush, or prowling about the settlers’ farms,\r\nwhere he has no business. Bob must be saving money fast, unless he has\r\nunseen ways of spending it. He works hard, and is well paid for his\r\nextra labour. He may have the advantage of me, after all; and settle on\r\na place of his own before me.”\r\n\r\n“Because he got a free passage as a punishment. That is really very\r\nhard, Frank.”\r\n\r\n“Harry Moore will be the first at liberty, however, Ellen; and that I am\r\nglad of on your account. I am soon to begin building you a house, at\r\nover hours; and you may depend on my doing my best to have it all\r\ncomplete by the time the six months are gone.”\r\n\r\n“Six months!” cried Ellen.\r\n\r\n“Why, I do not mean that you need wait till then. You may fairly marry\r\nas soon as you like;—and many in our own country would be glad to have\r\nthat said to them. I only mentioned six months as the time when Harry\r\nwould be all his own master. Then I shall hope to see you milking a cow\r\nof your own.—Meantime, till I have found out more about Jerry, be\r\ncautious how you get out of reach of those that will take care of you.”\r\n\r\nEllen sighed, and smiled, and wondered which was the strangest\r\nworld,—the one she had left behind, or the new one which seemed, after\r\nseveral months, nearly as foreign as when she had entered it. She had no\r\ndoubt which was the pleasantest. How could she, when a vague fear and\r\nthorough dislike of some of the people in the neighbourhood were the\r\nonly set-off against the prosperity of all whom she loved, and her own\r\nbright prospects with such a husband as Harry Moore had promised to be?\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                            LAW AND JUSTICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough convicts were unhappily supplied at an increasing rate from the\r\nmother-country, the demand for free labourers throughout Van Diemen’s\r\nLand became more urgent continually. The young men who settled either as\r\nwool-growers, farmers, or labourers, wanted wives. All above the lowest\r\nrank needed servants. The sheep were too many for the shepherds. There\r\nwas too little produce in proportion to the land; and too few dwellings\r\nin proportion to the produce; too much or too little of almost\r\neverything, for want of a due proportion of labour. The same thing is\r\nthe case at home; only here the proportions are exactly reversed. It\r\nwill be very strange if in a short time we do not rectify the condition\r\nof each country by the exchange which would be equally beneficial to\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nIreland and Van Diemen’s Land are islands of about the same size. They\r\nare each favoured by nature in an unusual degree, having all the\r\nrequisites of fertility, variety and beauty which can fit them to be the\r\nabodes of a thriving and happy population. The arable lands and pastures\r\nof both are excellent. The one has fisheries of salmon, herring and cod;\r\nthe other of whales, and seals for export, and of a large variety of\r\nfish for home consumption. Both have fine natural harbours, ridges of\r\nprotecting mountains, stores of mineral treasure, inland lakes, and\r\nfresh springs wherever man may incline to fix his abode. Both have, with\r\nall these advantages, their natural hardships and social troubles.\r\n\r\nThe natural hardships of each might be almost entirely removed by a\r\nwell-conducted reciprocity of assistance. Ireland has a population of\r\neight million; Van Diemen’s Land of only twenty-five thousand. In\r\nIreland, multitudes of half-starved wretches pine in idleness, and many\r\ndie by the way-side, of that wasting of limb and heart and life which is\r\nthe form in which poverty perpetrates murder. In Van Diemen’s Land, the\r\nlabourer is liable to be worn out by toil, and fretted by seeing half\r\nhis produce rotting on the ground, or wastefully bestowed on swine;\r\nwhile articles which he has always considered almost as necessary as\r\nfood cannot by any means be procured. With him, abundance is not wealth,\r\nand plenty brings not the happiness for which he looked. If the wide sea\r\ndid not lie between, he would beckon to a dozen Irishmen to come and\r\nnourish themselves with his superfluity, while he gathers about him the\r\ncomforts which spring out of their industry, and solaces himself with a\r\ndue portion of that repose, without a certain share of which the best\r\nends of life cannot be attained. Why should not a bridge be built across\r\nthis wide sea with the capital which is now unproductively expended on\r\nthe maintenance of these paupers? Why should not the charity which\r\n_cannot_ in Ireland give subsistence to one without taking it from\r\nanother, be employed in a way which gives support to many, to the\r\nbenefit of many more? Whatever funds are judiciously employed on\r\nemigration are used as if to bring to a junction with the over-peopled\r\ncountry a rich region, into which a hungry multitude may be poured, to\r\nthe relief of the old, and the great advantage of the new land. If the\r\nwealthy among the inhabitants of the old country would gladly if they\r\ncould, call up such a new region, drest in fertility, from the\r\nsurrounding sea, why do they delay effecting what is to their purpose\r\nthe same thing? Since they cannot move the land to their poor, why do\r\nthey not agree to devote what they now give in baneful charity to\r\nremoving their poor to the new land? Till such a general agreement is\r\narrived at, why do not individuals thus apply their charity, knowing\r\nthat thus they not only relieve for a time, but establish for life;—that\r\nthey not only assist the immediate objects of their bounty, but provide\r\nfor their descendants of many generations? The rich should choose for\r\ntheir almoners the agents of emigration. Those who have little to give\r\nshould unite their resources to send abroad a few of the young labourers\r\nof both sexes who are eager to go. Those who have no money to give,\r\nshould bestow their services in spreading the knowledge of the facts how\r\npoor-laws aggravate, and emigration alleviates, if it does not remove,\r\npauperism.\r\n\r\nIf this had been done long ago, the places whither we now transport our\r\ncriminals might at present have been as remarkable for the good moral\r\ncondition of their inhabitants as they actually are for the reverse. If\r\nit were now to be done effectually, it is yet possible that Botany Bay\r\nmay in time outgrow the odium attached to its name, and become the\r\nchosen resort of the upright and industrious. Indigence causes crime;\r\nand by the prevention of indigence and its consequent crime, we may\r\nbecome better able than we now fancy ourselves to dispense with the\r\ninstitution of penal settlements;—whose results are as disgraceful to\r\nBritish wisdom as that of a legal pauper provision.\r\n\r\nWhen Jerry and Bob were landed at Launceston, they were as unable as\r\nthose who sent them were disinclined, to reflect on the difference\r\nbetween their being sent there, innocent, to provide an honest\r\nlivelihood for themselves, and being deposited as a curse upon this new\r\nregion,—both guilty and one hardened, proscribed by the old country and\r\ndreaded by the new, and prepared to baffle all the professed objects of\r\ntheir punishment. The guilt of these lads was distinctly referrible to\r\nindigence. Their parents could give them little wherewith to provide for\r\ntheir bodies, and nothing of that care and instruction which were\r\npeculiarly needful to them in their circumstances of temptation. Being\r\nthus made outcasts, they acted as outcasts; from which time it became a\r\nstruggle between themselves and society which could inflict the most\r\nmisery upon the other. They put society in fear, violated its rights,\r\nmocked its institutions, and helped to corrupt its yet innocent members.\r\nSociety inflicted on them disgrace, bondage, and banishment; and from\r\nall this misery no good resulted, however much was proposed.\r\n\r\nThe judge who pronounced sentence on Jerry and Bob told them that it was\r\nnecessary to the security of society that they should be prevented from\r\ninflicting any further injury by their evil deeds.—There are two ways by\r\nwhich such prevention may be accomplished; one by the death, the other\r\nby the reformation, of the offender. Death was too severe a punishment\r\nfor the offence of these lads; the judge must therefore have\r\ncontemplated their reformation, or have thought only of England when he\r\nspoke of society. Did the law gain its object?\r\n\r\n“I say, Bob,” said Jerry one evening, when they had got the leave it is\r\nso easy to obtain to go out of bounds, and work for themselves\r\nover-hours,—“I say, do you remember what that fellow in Newgate read us\r\nabout that cursed gaol where the people are mewed up as close as if they\r\nwere in a school, and closer?”\r\n\r\n“What that where they are shut in by themselves all night, and hard\r\nworked all day, and nobody may speak but the parson, and he praying and\r\npreaching night and morning, till a fellow’s spirit is downright broken?\r\nRemember it! aye; and glad enough I have been many a time that we are\r\nnot there. I’d rather be hanged twice over.”\r\n\r\n“Hanged! Yes: there’s not much in hanging. I have seen it several times,\r\nand thought to myself, ‘if that’s all, I should not mind it.’ But we are\r\nthe best off, after all. I was horribly afraid, when old wiggy began to\r\nwhimper, that it was to be the hulks, or a long prison, instead of going\r\nabroad; for one never knows what they mean when they say\r\n‘transportation.’ You would not have looked so downcast as you did if\r\nyou had known what was before you.“\r\n\r\n“Not I. I never thought to be made of so much consequence. ’Tis good fun\r\nto see them quarrel which shall have us, and to get them to bid rum and\r\nbrandy against each other to seduce us away. We that could not get dry\r\nbread at home,—how easy it is for us to fill our stomachs with the\r\nchoice of the land, and get drunk with our masters at the end of the\r\nday,—our masters being luckily of our own sort!”\r\n\r\n“Yours, that is, Bob; not mine. But I don’t know but I like mine as\r\nwell. He gives me plenty of spare hours, on condition of my bringing\r\nback what I earn. You should have seen what a fright he looked in when\r\nsomebody said the folks were growing moral at home, and no more convicts\r\nwere to be sent out.”\r\n\r\n“He was as sorry as some honester folks would be glad, Jerry. But as for\r\ndividing your earnings with your master,—they are a queer sort of\r\nearnings, I have a notion.”\r\n\r\n“Easily got enough. ’Tis only just prowling on the downs in a dark night\r\nto meet a stray sheep; or making a venture into the fold. Then, if one\r\ngets so far as into the bush, there are other ways that you know nothing\r\nof yet, Bob.”\r\n\r\n“I never can make out how you get seal oil from the woods; being as we\r\nare thirty miles from the sea.”\r\n\r\nJerry laughed, and offered to introduce his brother one day to somebody\r\nin the bush he little dreamed of.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean, Frank, poor fellow, or Ellen? They would not go so far to\r\nmeet you.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think I would ask them? It will be time enough for me to notice\r\nFrank when I have a house of my own to ask him into. I shall be the\r\nmaster of such as he before his time is out.”\r\n\r\n“You need not carry yourself so high, Jerry. You are in a worse bondage\r\nthan he just now.”\r\n\r\n“Curse them that put me into it, and let them see if I bear it long!\r\nHowever, hold your tongue about it now. There is the moon through the\r\ntrees, and the free turf under our feet. What a pity there is nobody\r\nwith a heavy purse likely to pass while we are resting in the shadow\r\nunder this clump! ’Tis such dull work when there is nothing better to be\r\nhad than sheep and poultry, and so many of them that they are scarcely\r\nworth the taking!”\r\n\r\n“I like roving for the sake of roving,” said Bob. “I have plenty of\r\nmutton without stealing it.”\r\n\r\n“I like robbing for the sake of robbing,” replied his brother; “and the\r\nmutton is only the price of my frolic. But there is something I like\r\nbetter. Let us be off, and I will show you, (if you’ll swear not to\r\nblab,) how you may get such sport as you little think for. Learn to\r\nhandle a gun, and to cross a farm-yard like a cat, and to tap at a\r\nback-door like a mouse within a wainscot, and you may laugh at the judge\r\nand the law, and all the dogs they have set to worry us.”\r\n\r\n“Why no, thank’ee,” replied Bob. “I am trying after a character, you\r\nknow, so I shall stay where I am. I’ll light my pipe; and I’ve got rum\r\nenough to last till morning both for myself and somebody I rather expect\r\nto meet me.”\r\n\r\n“Take care she be not too deep for you, Bob. If ever you want a wife\r\nwith no more sense than a monkey, and not half as many tricks, ask me,\r\nand I will show you how to get one.”\r\n\r\nSo much for the reformation of the offender. The other kind of security\r\non which the judge expatiated was that afforded by the criminal being\r\nmade a warning.\r\n\r\nA waggon load of new convict-labourers arrived at the Dairy Plains one\r\nday, when the accustomed gang was at work on the road which was not yet\r\ncompleted. The masters who happened to be present were too much taken up\r\nwith observing the new-comers to pay any attention to the looks of their\r\nlabourers. They did not see the winks, and the side-long smiles, they\r\ndid not hear the snapping of fingers behind their backs; they had no\r\nsuspicion that some in the waggon were old acquaintances of those on the\r\nroad. On the first opportunity after the fresh men were left with the\r\nothers, and only one or two over-lookers near, there was a prodigious\r\nhand-shaking and congratulation, and questioning. “How did you get\r\nover?” “How did you manage to get sent _here_?” “How do you like\r\ntransportation?” “You’ll soon learn to know your own luck.” “This is a\r\nfine country, is it not?” &c. &c.\r\n\r\n“I was so cursedly dull after you all went away,” observed one of the\r\nnew-comers, “there was nothing to stay for: but I very near got sent to\r\nSidney.”\r\n\r\n“Well; you could soon have got away, either home or here. But how do you\r\nfind yourself off?”\r\n\r\n“With a bed to myself and a blanket, and rare good living to what I had\r\nwhen I was an honest man. The thing I don’t like is the work; but they\r\nsay we are to have plenty of spirits.”\r\n\r\n“To be sure; and as to the work,—what do the poor wretches at home do\r\nbut work as hard as you, and for less than you can get in spare hours.\r\nBut where’s Sam? Why did not he come too?”\r\n\r\n“He got baulked, as he deserved for being a fool. What did he do but\r\nsend his sister to the justice to know how much he must steal to be\r\ntransported, and no more? The justice set the parson at him; and between\r\nthe two, they have cowed him, poor fellow, and he will never better his\r\ncondition.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he is afraid. Perhaps he believes what the judge said about our\r\nbeing a warning. And yet he tipped me the wink when that was said, and\r\nwhen some of the pretty ones in the gallery began to cry.”\r\n\r\n“He knows better than you think. If you were as moped as a linnet in a\r\ncage, he would know nothing of it; because you are too far off for him\r\nto see what became of you, in that case; but, being as you are, a merry,\r\nrollicking set, he would like to be among you; and that sort of news\r\ntravels fast.”\r\n\r\nAnother of the party did not like his lot so well. He said nothing of\r\nthe disgrace, though he felt it; but he complained of the toil, of the\r\ntyranny of the masters, of the spite and bickerings of his companions.\r\n\r\n“If you don’t like your company, change it,” replied one to whom he had\r\nopened his mind. “Such a good hand as you are at a burglary, I don’t\r\nwonder that you had rather steal enough in one night to live upon for a\r\nmonth, than work as commoner hands do. You had better go back. Jerry\r\nwill tell you how. Nothing is easier.”\r\n\r\n“Well; but there is my little woman yonder, that they were so kind as to\r\nsend over at the same time; how is she to get back? She can’t turn\r\nsailor, and get her passage home in that way.”\r\n\r\n“Trust her for making terms with some gull of a sailor,” replied the\r\nother, laughing. “It is only following an old trade for a particular\r\nreason; and you’ll give her leave till you touch land again. But let me\r\nhear before you go; there are some acquaintance of mine in London that\r\nwill be glad to know you; and you may chance to help one another;\r\nthough, to be sure, you take a higher line.”\r\n\r\n“Are you thinking of sending over the fee they raised for your defence?”\r\n\r\n“I did intend it, as a point of honour; but they assure me they made a\r\ngood bargain of it as it was. They could have paid the fee three times\r\nover out of the plate-chest they stole for it. So I don’t know that I\r\nneed trouble myself.”\r\n\r\n“So while Counsellor H—— was preaching about your being tried that\r\npeople might be safe, there was another robbery going on to pay him his\r\nfees. That’s rare! You should go back, (since the way is so easy,) and\r\npick Counsellor H—’s pocket. That will mend the joke.”\r\n\r\nSo much for the security to society from the exhibition of this kind of\r\nwarning.\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTMAS AMUSEMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEllen’s wedding day drew near. Frank and Harry Moore had toiled together\r\nat spare hours to erect and fit up a convenient dwelling; and there was\r\nno fear whatever but that she and her husband would be amply supplied\r\nwith all the necessaries and many of the comforts of life. Her father\r\nbegan to smile upon her, though he muttered complaints of there being so\r\nmany changes always going on that none of them ever knew when they were\r\nsettled. Her step-mother, though still hinting that the girl knew what\r\nshe was about when she was in such a hurry to come away from a poor\r\nparish, seemed very well satisfied to have matters so arranged, and\r\nrather proud than otherwise of belonging to Ellen. The farmer and his\r\nwife whom Ellen served sighed when they found she was going to leave\r\nthem, and observed that it was always the way, as soon as they got\r\nsuited with a dairy maid; but as she agreed to go on taking care of\r\ntheir cows till they could obtain another damsel in her place from\r\nHobart Town, they treated her very graciously. The only serious drawback\r\nto her comfort was that Harry’s fellow-labourers would go on courting\r\nher, though they knew she was engaged, and that this caused Harry to be\r\nmore jealous than she felt there was any occasion for, or than she could\r\neasily excuse. She had no other fault to find with Harry; but she was\r\nmore than once on the point of breaking off the match on this account,\r\nand if it had not been for Frank’s interposition, and his assurances\r\nthat such feelings were very natural in Harry, she would have thrown\r\naway her own happiness for want of being sufficiently aware of the\r\ndanger of such a position as hers to a girl of less principle than\r\nherself.—A circumstance happened, a few days before her marriage, which\r\neverybody else thought very disastrous; but which she could not think\r\nso, since it established a perfect understanding between Harry and\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 21st of December,—the height of summer in Van\r\nDiemen’s Land,—Frank appeared, breathless, in the farm-yard whither\r\nEllen was just going to milk her cows; Castle at the same moment was\r\nseen at some distance, hastening from the downs where he ought to have\r\nbeen tending his sheep at this hour; Harry Moore next leaped the gate\r\nand wiped his brows, seeming too much agitated to speak; the farmer\r\npulled his hat over his eyes, in anticipation of the news that was\r\ncoming, and the women crowded together in terror.—Ellen was the first to\r\nask what was the matter.\r\n\r\n“Have your men decamped, farmer?” inquired Frank.\r\n\r\n“Yes, almost to a man. Have Stapleton’s?”\r\n\r\n“Two out of four; and every settler in the neighbourhood misses more or\r\nless this morning.”\r\n\r\n“Now the devil and his imps will be on us in the shape of a gang of\r\nbush-rangers,” muttered the farmer.\r\n\r\n“Not on us, farmer. They will more likely go to some distant part where\r\ntheir faces are strange.”\r\n\r\n“If they do, they will send strange faces here, which comes to the same\r\nthing; for one bush-ranger’s face is as devilish as another. One of us\r\nmust be off in search of a guard, and our shepherds, and indeed all of\r\nus, must carry arms.”\r\n\r\nEllen turned pale at the mention of arms. Harry drew to her side, and\r\ntold her in a tone of forced calmness that three of her lovers were\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n“Gone!” cried Ellen joyfully. “Gone for good?”\r\n\r\n“Gone for ever as lovers of yours.”\r\n\r\n“Thank God!” said she. “Better watch night and day with arms in our\r\nhands than have your head full of fancies, Harry. You will never believe\r\nagain that I can like such people: and you shall teach me to fire a gun,\r\nso as to defend the house while you are away; and I shall not be afraid\r\nof anything when you are at home.”\r\n\r\nHarry was so alert and happy from this moment that one would have\r\nthought there had been a certainty that no bush-rangers would ever come\r\nagain, instead of a threatening that those who had till now been\r\nservants would soon reappear as enemies.\r\n\r\nWhatever arms could be found up were put into the hands of the\r\nshepherds, as they were most in danger from violence for the sake of\r\ntheir flocks. They were desired to keep in sight of one another so far\r\nas that each should be able to make a certain signal agreed on, in case\r\nof his having reason to suppose that there were enemies at hand. Frank\r\ndeparted immediately for Launceston, for powder and ball, and a further\r\nsupply of labourers to fill the places of those who had eloped. Another\r\nmessenger was sent to the seat of government to give information of what\r\nhad happened. During the absence of her brother, Ellen heard enough of\r\nthe evils inflicted by runaway convicts to alarm a stouter heart than\r\nany young girl devotedly attached to her lover ever had; and to add to\r\nher uneasiness, her father once more became gloomy, and poor little\r\nSusan clung to her side wherever she went. Harry left his work twenty\r\ntimes a day to tell her that all was quiet, and bid her not be alarmed.\r\nDuring the day, she followed his advice pretty well; but in the\r\nevenings, so many tales of horror went round that, though she did not\r\nbelieve the half of them, her confidence was shaken; and she went to bed\r\nshuddering to think of what might have happened before morning.\r\n\r\nThe bush-rangers seemed to be less dreaded by the settlers than the\r\nnatives. The bush-rangers came down in a troop, carried off what they\r\nwanted, occasionally shooting a man or two during the process, and then\r\nwent completely away. The warfare of the natives was much more\r\nhorrible,—their movements being stealthy, their revenge insatiable,\r\ntheir cruelty revolting. They would hover about for days or weeks before\r\ncommitting an outrage, planning the most wicked way of proceeding, and\r\nseizing the most defenceless moment for pouncing on their victims.\r\nCastle asked aloud, what Ellen inquired in her heart, why all this was\r\nnot told them before they came, and what there was in wealth which could\r\ncompensate for such alarms as they were now suffering under? Frank\r\nsatisfied her, in some degree, when he returned on the 24th,—the day\r\nbefore her wedding. He told her that though the first settlers had\r\nsuffered dreadfully from the murders and plunder of the hostile natives\r\nand runaway convicts, this was not a sufficient reason to deter other\r\nsettlers from following, since, owing to the vigorous measures of the\r\nAustralian government, such outrages had been repressed and nearly put\r\nan end to. He pointed out to her that the horrible tales she had been\r\ntold related to former times, and assured her that, except in some\r\ndistricts near the wilder parts of the island, the face of a savage had\r\nnot been seen for years.—Ellen pointed to the mountain wastes on which\r\ntheir settlement bordered, and Frank acknowledged that the Dairy Plains\r\nlay as open to an attack as most newly-settled districts; but he had\r\nbeen assured at Launceston that there was no need to terrify themselves\r\nwith apprehensions as long as they were armed and properly careful in\r\ntheir movements; since the sound of a musket would disperse a whole\r\ntroop of savages, and they attacked no place that was not left\r\nabsolutely defenceless. He had distinctly ascertained what he had before\r\nconjectured,—that it was not the practice of runaway convicts to plunder\r\nsettlements where their faces were known, and that the only danger\r\ntherefore arose from the probability that they might injure the savages,\r\nwho might come down to wreak their revenge upon the innocent settlers.\r\n\r\n“If this is all,” sighed Ellen, “there is nothing——”\r\n\r\n“To prevent your being married to-morrow, Ellen. So I have been telling\r\nHarry.”\r\n\r\n“There was no occasion, thank you. I never meant to put it off. The more\r\ndanger, the more reason for our being together. Besides, it will help to\r\ntake father’s mind off from his discontent. He has been wishing himself\r\nback in Kent every hour since you went.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed! Well now, I think that such an occasional fright as this is\r\nlittle to the hardship of living as we did at A——, to say nothing of the\r\ncertainty of there soon being an end to it. The only two evils our\r\nsettlers suffer from will grow less every year; the scarcity of labour,\r\nand danger of theft. To make up for these, we have the finest climate in\r\nthe world, abundance of all that we at present want, and the prospect of\r\nseeing our children, and their children again, well provided for.—But\r\nyou must be in a hurry now, dear, considering what has to be done\r\nto-morrow. So go, and cheer up, and trouble your head no more about\r\nblack or white thieves.”\r\n\r\nEllen had, however, little more than usual to do this day, as hers was\r\nnot the kind of wedding to require preparation. The travelling chaplain\r\nwho was to come and perform the Christmas service, was to marry the\r\nyoung people, and thus only was the day to be marked as different from\r\nany other. The settlers, no doubt, thought much of their friends in\r\nEngland, and of the festivities which are there enjoyed by all but those\r\nwhose poverty deprives them of the means: but the seasons are so\r\nentirely reversed in Van Diemen’s Land,—it is so impossible amidst the\r\nbrilliant verdure, the heat and long days of the Christmas season there,\r\nto adopt the festivities carried on at home beside the hearth and over\r\nthe punch-bowl, that Christmas-day was allowed to pass quietly, and the\r\ngrand holidays of the year were wisely made on the anniversaries of\r\ntheir settlement in their present abodes,—of their entrance on a life of\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nNo fairer morning ever dawned than that on which Ellen arose very early,\r\nand stole out to find that refreshment in the open air which she was not\r\ndisposed to seek in more sleep. She had rested well for a few hours, but\r\nthe first rays of the sun finding their way into her chamber, (which was\r\nmore like a clean loft than an English bedroom), roused her to thoughts\r\nthat prevented her sleeping again. It was too soon to be looking after\r\nher cows; so she took her knitting, and sat on the bench outside the\r\nhouse, whence she could look over a vast tract of country, and where she\r\nwas pretty sure of an hour’s quiet. She had some thoughts to spare for\r\nher old Kentish neighbours; and began to fancy how her grandmother would\r\nbe getting up three hours after, when it would be scarcely dawning, to\r\nmake the room tidy, and light the fire to boil the kettle; and how the\r\nold couple would put on their best, and draw over the hearth with their\r\nChristmas breakfast. Then she thought of the many boys and girls she\r\nknew who would be going to church, with red noses, and shivering in\r\ntheir scanty clothing. Then she sighed when she remembered that she\r\nmight never more hear psalms sung in a church; and again she smiled\r\nwhile fancying Mr. Fellowes’s great dinner to half the parish,—a dinner\r\nof roast beef and ale and plum puddings, and Mr. Jackson there to say\r\ngrace, and the clerk to sing a Christmas carol, and every old man giving\r\na toast by turns, and some one perhaps to propose the healths of their\r\nfriends far away. She blushed, all alone as she was, when she wondered\r\nwhat they would say if they knew she was to be married so soon,\r\nespecially if they could see Harry. It was strange, while her mind was\r\nthus full of pictures of a frosty day, of a smoking table, of a roaring\r\nfire, lamps, and a steaming punch-bowl, to look up and observe what was\r\nbefore her eyes. The scene was not even like a midsummer morning in\r\nKent. It was not dotted with villages: there were no hop-grounds, and\r\nall the apples grown within five miles would hardly have made an\r\norchard. There were no spires among the trees; nor did the morning mists\r\nrise from the dells or hover over the meadows. All was clear and dry and\r\nverdant under the deep blue sky. No haze hung over the running streams\r\nthat found their way among the grassy hillocks. Neither oak nor beech\r\ngrew on the hill side, nor pines on the ridges of the mountains behind;\r\nbut trees to whose strange foliage her eye was yet unaccustomed reared\r\ntheir lofty stems where it did not appear that the hand of man was\r\nlikely to have planted them; and myrtles and geraniums grew up\r\nroof-high, like the finest monthly roses in England. Instead of the\r\nlittle white butterflies flitting over the daisied turf, there were\r\nsplendid ones alighting here and there in the neighbouring garden,\r\nlarger and gayer than the finest of the flowers they fed upon. Instead\r\nof the lark rising from her dewy nest into the pink morning cloud, there\r\nwere green and crimson parrots glancing among the lofty evergreens.\r\nInstead of flickering swarms of midges, flies shone like emeralds in the\r\nsun. Instead of a field-mouse venturing out of its hole, or frogs\r\nleaping across the path, speckled and gilded snakes (of which Ellen had\r\nlearned not to be afraid) wriggled out into the sunshine, and finding\r\nthat the world was not all asleep, made haste to hide themselves again.\r\n\r\n“If I could fancy any part of this to be England,” thought Ellen, “it\r\nwould be yonder spot behind the range of woodland, where the smoke is\r\nrising. If that were but grandfather’s cottage, how I would run and\r\nbring them here before any body else was up. They will be so sorry not\r\nto have seen me married, and not to know Harry! But I cannot make out\r\nthat smoke. I did not know that anybody lived there, and it looks more\r\nthan enough to come from a single chimney. Perhaps the man that found\r\nthe brick clay, and talked of having a kiln, may have settled there. I\r\nwill ask Harry. I wonder what o’clock it is now! He said he should\r\nfinish his morning’s work first, that he might stay when he did come.\r\nHow odd it seems that there are so few people to do things here, that a\r\nman can scarcely be spared from his work on his wedding day! They must\r\nbe all over-sleeping themselves, I think. I’ll just get the milk-pails,\r\nand that may wake them; and if the cows are milked a little earlier than\r\nusual, it will not signify. I only get fidgetty, sitting here, and\r\nfancying noises; from missing the singing-birds, I dare say, that are\r\nbusy among the boughs on such a morning as this in England. It was an\r\nodd squeak and whistle that I heard just now; perhaps a quail or a\r\nparroquet, or some other bird that I don’t know the note of yet. Or it\r\nmight be one of those noisy black swans on the lake yonder. I will not\r\nstay any longer to be startled. That was only a butterfly that flew\r\ndazzling before my eyes; and these flies do not sting, so I need not\r\nmind their buzzing. There! I had rather hear that lowing that I have\r\nbeen used to from a child than any music in the world. I should be sorry\r\nindeed to give up these cows, for all I am going to have one of my own.”\r\n\r\nEllen purposely made some noise in getting her pails, that she might\r\nwake somebody and find out how time went. She could not account for the\r\nsun being so low in the sky till she heard the farmer growl that he\r\nwished people would be quiet till it was time to get up; which it would\r\nnot be for two hours yet.\r\n\r\nAfter pausing before the door to watch the distant smoke, which had much\r\nincreased, Ellen repaired to the cow-yard, immediately behind the\r\ndwelling. She stumbled on something in the litter which she mistook for\r\na little black pig, till its cry made her think it was something much\r\nless agreeable to meet with. Stooping down, she saw that it was\r\ncertainly a black baby; ugly and lean and dirty; but certainly a baby.\r\nShe did not scream; she had the presence of mind not to touch the little\r\nthing, remembering that, for aught she knew, the parents might be\r\nlurking among the sheds, and ready to spring upon her if she should\r\nattempt to carry away the infant, which had probably been dropped in the\r\nhurry of getting out of her way. Trembling and dreading to look behind\r\nher, she stepped back into the house, and now roused the farmer in good\r\nearnest. In a few minutes, the whole household was in the cow-yard; the\r\nmen not choosing to separate, and the women being afraid to leave their\r\nprotectors. The child was still there, and nothing was discovered in the\r\ngeneral search of the premises which now took place. When the farmer saw\r\nthe smoke at a distance, he ascribed it at once to a party of natives\r\nhaving set the grass on fire in cooking their kangaroo repast. He\r\nthought it probable that two or three spies might be at hand, and the\r\nrest of the party ready for a summons to fall on the farm as soon as it\r\nshould, by any accident, be left undefended. He would not have the child\r\nbrought into the house, but fed it himself with milk, and laid it on\r\nsome straw near where it was found, in a conspicuous situation. Beside\r\nit he placed some brandy, and a portion of food for the parents, if they\r\nshould choose to come for it.\r\n\r\n“There is no knowing,” said he, “but they may be looking on; and one may\r\nas well give them the chance of feeling kindly, and making peace with\r\nus.” And he silenced one of his men who began to expatiate on the\r\nimpossibility of obtaining any but a false peace with these treacherous\r\nsavages.\r\n\r\nNothing could satisfy Harry but standing over his betrothed with a\r\nmusket while she was milking. As for her, every rustle among the leaves,\r\nevery movement of the cow before her, made her inwardly start; though\r\nshe managed admirably to keep her terrors to herself.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the chaplain happened fortunately for collecting the\r\nneighbouring settlers; and, by the farmer’s desire, nothing was said of\r\nwhat had happened till the services he came to perform were ended. Harry\r\nand Ellen were married, amidst some grave looks from the family of which\r\nthey had till now made a part, and the smiles of all the guests. Ellen’s\r\ndisappointed lovers,—the only people who could possibly disapprove of\r\nthe ceremony,—were absent; and she tried not to think about what they\r\nmight be doing or planning.\r\n\r\nThe barking of the dogs next drew the party to the door, and they saw\r\nwhat was a strange sight to many of the new-comers. A flock of emus, or\r\nnative ostriches, was speeding over the plain, almost within shot.\r\n\r\n“What are they?” inquired one.\r\n\r\n“’Tis many a month since we have seen an emu,” observed another. “I\r\nthought we had frightened away all that were left in these parts.”\r\n\r\n“What are you all about,” cried a third. “Out with the dogs and after\r\nthem! Make chase before it is too late!”\r\n\r\n“A decoy! a decoy!” exclaimed the farmer. “Now I am certain that mine is\r\na marked place. These savages have driven down the emus before them, to\r\ntempt us men out to hunt, and they are crouching near to fall on while\r\nwe are away.”\r\n\r\nHe was as bold, however, as he was discerning. He left three or four men\r\nto guard the women and stock at home, and set off, as if on a sudden\r\nimpulse, to hunt emus with the rest of his company, determining to\r\ndescribe a circuit of some miles, (including the spot whence the smoke\r\narose) and to leave no lurking place unsearched. Frank went with him.\r\nCastle insisted on following his usual occupation on the downs,\r\ndeclaring himself safe enough, with companions within call, and on an\r\nopen place where no one could come within half a mile without being\r\nseen. This was protection enough against an enemy who carried no other\r\nweapons than hatchets and pointed sticks, hardly worthy of the name of\r\nspears.—Harry remained, of course, with his bride.\r\n\r\nThe day wore away tediously while the home guard now patrolled the\r\npremises, now indolently began to work at any little thing that might\r\nhappen to want doing in the farm-yard, and then came to sit on the bench\r\nbefore the door, complaining of the heat. The women, meanwhile, peeped\r\nfrom the door, or came out to chat, or listened for the cry of the dogs,\r\nthat they might learn in which direction the hunting party was turning.\r\n\r\n“Ellen,” said her husband, “I do wonder you can look so busy on our\r\nwedding day.”\r\n\r\n“O, I am not really busy! It is only to drive away thought when you are\r\nout of sight.”\r\n\r\n“Well then, come with me across the road,—just to our own cottage, and\r\nsee how pretty it was made for us to have dined in to-day, if all this\r\nhad not happened. Frank was there after you left it last night; and\r\nthere is more in it than you expect to see.—Now, don’t look so afraid.\r\nIt is no further than yonder saw-pit; and I tell you there is not a hole\r\nthat a snake can creep into that we have not searched within this\r\nhour.—I do not believe there is a savage within twenty miles.—O, the\r\nbaby!—Aye. I suppose it dropped from the clouds, or one of the dogs may\r\nhave picked it up in the bush. ’Tis not for myself that I care for all\r\nthis disturbance: ’tis because they have spoiled your wedding day so\r\nthat you will never bear to look back to it.”\r\n\r\nEllen wished they were but rid of their black foes for this time, and\r\nthen she should care little what her wedding day had been. They said\r\nthat one sight of a savage in a life-time was as much as most settlers\r\nhad.—She must step in passing to see what ailed the poor infant, which\r\nwas squalling in much the same style as if it had had a white skin;—a\r\nsquall against which Ellen could not shut her heart any more than her\r\nears.\r\n\r\n“I must take it and quiet it,” said she. “I can put it down again as we\r\ncome back in ten minutes.”\r\n\r\nSo lulling and rocking the little woolly-headed savage in her arms, she\r\nproceeded to her own cottage, to admire whatever had been suggested by\r\nher husband, and added by her neat-handed brother.\r\n\r\n“What bird makes that odd noise?” inquired Ellen presently. “A magpie,\r\nor a parrot, or what? I heard it early this morning, and never before. A\r\nsqueak and then a sort of whistle. Hark!”\r\n\r\n“’Tis no bird,” said Harry in a hoarse whisper. “Shut and bar the door\r\nafter me!”\r\n\r\nAnd he darted out of the cottage. Instead of shutting the door, Ellen\r\nflew to the window to watch what became of Harry. He was shouting and in\r\nfull pursuit of something which leaped like a kangaroo through the high\r\ngrass. He fired, and, as she judged by his cry of triumph, reached his\r\nmark. A rustle outside the door at this moment caught her excited ear;\r\nand on turning, she saw, distinct in the sunshine on the door-sill, the\r\nshadow of a human figure, as of some one lying in wait outside. Faint\r\nwith the pang of terror, she sunk down on a chair in the middle of the\r\nroom, with the baby still in her arms, and gazed at the open doorway\r\nwith eyes that might seem starting from their sockets. Immediately the\r\nblack form she dreaded to see began to appear. A crouching, grovelling\r\nsavage, lean and coarse as an ape, showing his teeth among his painted\r\nbeard, and fixing his snakelike eyes upon hers, came creeping on his\r\nknees and one hand, the other holding a glittering hatchet. Ellen made\r\nneither movement nor sound. If it had been a wild beast, she might have\r\nsnatched up a loaded musket which was behind her, and have attempted to\r\ndefend herself; but this was a man,—among all his deformities, still a\r\nman; and she was kept motionless by a more enervating horror than she\r\nwould once have believed any human being could inspire her with. It was\r\nwell she left the weapon alone. It was better handled by another. Harry,\r\nreturning with the musket he had just discharged, caught a full view of\r\nthe creature grovelling at his door, and had the misery of feeling\r\nhimself utterly unable to defend his wife. In a moment, he bethought\r\nhimself of the back window, and of the loaded musket standing beside it.\r\nIt proved to be within reach; but his wife was sitting almost in a\r\nstraight line between him and the savage. No matter! he must fire, for\r\nher last moment was come if he did not. In a fit of desperation he took\r\naim as the creature was preparing for a spring. The ball whistled past\r\nEllen’s ear, and lodged in the head of the foe.\r\n\r\nThey were indeed safe, though it was long before they could believe\r\nthemselves so, or Ellen could take courage to cross to the farm to tell\r\nwhat had happened. As there were no more traces of lurkers in the\r\nneighbourhood, it was supposed that the one shot in the grass was the\r\nmother, the one in the door-way, the father of the infant which no one\r\nnow knew what to do with. It might be dangerous to keep it, whether it\r\nflourished or died under the care of the settlers; and there seemed to\r\nbe no place where it could be deposited with the hope of its being found\r\nby its own tribe. When Frank and his companions returned from the hunt,\r\nthey threw light on this and other curious matters, and brought\r\ncomfortable tidings to the inmates of the farm. The Castles, indeed, and\r\nthey alone, found as much matter of concern as of comfort in what Frank\r\nhad to tell.\r\n\r\nIn following the emu hunt, the farmer and his party had skirted a tract\r\nof woodland, called the bush, within which they perceived traces of\r\npersons having lately passed. On searching further, they came upon a\r\nscene rather different from what they had expected, and not the most\r\nagreeable in the world, though it fully accounted for the visit of the\r\nnatives.—Under a large mimosa, which waved its long branches of yellow\r\nflowers over the turf, and made a flickering shade, lay Jerry, enjoying\r\nthe perfection of convict luxury; that is, smoking his pipe, drinking\r\nrum, and doing what he pleased, with a black wife, who, having skinned\r\nthe kangaroo and lighted the fire, squatted down on the turf, waiting\r\nfor further orders. If it had not been for the child she carried in a\r\nhood of hide on her shoulders, she would have been taken for a tame\r\nmonkey, so little was there human in her appearance and gestures; but\r\nthe tiny face that peeped over her shoulder had that in it which bespoke\r\nhumanity, however soon the dawning rationality might be destined to be\r\nextinguished.—On seeing the hunting-party, Jerry sprang to his feet,\r\nseized his arms, and whistled shrill and long; whereupon so many\r\nhootings and whistlings were heard through the wood, so many ferocious\r\nfaces appeared from among the brakes on every hand that it became\r\nprudent to explain that no war was intended by the hunting-party. Frank\r\nand Jerry were the spokesmen; and the result of their conference was the\r\ncommunication of news of much importance to both parties. Jerry learned\r\nthat the settlements below were so well guarded and reinforced that any\r\nattempt at plunder must fail; and he assured Frank that he was about to\r\ndepart at once with his band to one of the islands in Bass’s Strait, to\r\nlive among, or reign over the natives, as many a convict had done before\r\nhim. He owned that his black wife was stolen, and that her husband\r\nhaving been knocked on the head in the scuffle, the rest of the savage\r\nparty had gone down to wreak their revenge on the first whites they\r\ncould meet with. He was really sorry, he declared, to hear how Ellen’s\r\nwedding-day had been disturbed; and solemnly promised to draw off the\r\nfoe to a distant quarter, and watch that they did not again molest the\r\nDairy Plains. Frank could trust to these promises, as poor Jerry, amidst\r\nall his iniquities, retained a rude sense of honour, and a lingering\r\nattachment to his family,—especially a pride in his sister Ellen.—Frank\r\nlearned with great satisfaction that Bob’s disappearance from the\r\nneighbourhood was not owing to his having run away. He had refused to do\r\nso, his ambition being to become a great man in the settlement, provided\r\nhe could accomplish his object without too much trouble and self-denial.\r\nHe had made a merit of remaining at his work when his comrades eloped,\r\nand had, in consequence, got promoted to a better kind of employment, by\r\nwhich he had it in his power to make a good deal of money.\r\n\r\n“And now, Ellen,” said Frank, on concluding the story of his morning’s\r\nadventures, “I must go and bring you the wedding present poor Jerry left\r\nbehind for you.” And he explained that a sun-dial was hidden in a secure\r\nplace, whence it should be brought and put up immediately.\r\n\r\n“Is it stolen, do you think?” inquired Ellen timidly. “Indeed, I had\r\nrather not have it.”\r\n\r\n“It is not stolen. A watch-maker, a clever man enough, came over in the\r\nsame ship with the lads, and Jerry paid him for making this dial for\r\nyou, knowing you had no watch. He could easily have sent you money, he\r\nsaid, but thought you would like this better, since there is little that\r\ncan be bought in these parts that you have not without money.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know how it is,” observed Ellen; “but though it is very\r\nshocking that Jerry has got among these people, and into such a brutal\r\nway of life, I feel less afraid of them now that he is there. If it were\r\nnot for this, I should feel that such a fright as we have had will set\r\nagainst a great deal of the good we have fallen in with here.”\r\n\r\n“It always happens, Ellen, all through life, and all over the world,\r\nthat there is something to set against other things; and never more so\r\nthan when people leave their own country. If a man quits England through\r\nintolerable poverty, he must not expect to find everything to his mind,\r\nand abundance besides. If he goes to Canada, he may gain what he\r\nemigrates for,—food for himself and property to leave to his children;\r\nbut he must put up with tremendous toil and hardship till he can bring\r\nhis land into order, and with long, dreary winters, such as he had no\r\nnotion of before. If he goes to the Cape, he finds a better climate and\r\nless toil; but from the manner of letting land there, he is out of the\r\nway of society and neighbourhood, and cannot save so as to make his\r\nchildren richer than himself. If he comes here, he finds the finest\r\nclimate in the world, and an easy way of settling; but then there is the\r\nplague of having convicts always about him, and the occasional peril of\r\nbeing robbed;—and in some few of the wilder parts of the island, of an\r\nindividual here and there being murdered. But this last danger is\r\ngrowing less every year, and cannot exist long.—Now, since there is evil\r\neverywhere, the question is what is the least? I, for one, think them\r\nall less than living in England in hopeless poverty, or even than\r\ngetting a toilsome subsistence there with the sight of hopeless poverty\r\never before one’s eyes, and the groans or vicious mirth of pauperism\r\nechoing through the alleys of all the cities of England. I, for one,\r\nfeel it well worth anything troublesome we have met with, or can meet\r\nwith here, to plant my foot on this hill, and look down upon yonder\r\nfarmsteads, and over all these plains and hills and dales, with smoke\r\nrising here and there, and say to myself ‘There is not so much as one\r\npauper within a hundred miles.’”\r\n\r\nWhen, after a few days, the black baby had, by Jerry’s means, been\r\nrestored to his tribe, when the country was known to be clear of such\r\nunwelcome intruders, and Harry and Ellen were therefore at liberty to\r\nsettle down at length in their own house, the bride was quite of her\r\nbrother’s opinion respecting the goodliness of the exchange from\r\npauperism in Kent to plenty in Van Diemen’s Land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                       THE MORE THE BETTER CHEER.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank kept his promise of writing to his friend Mr. Jackson, from time\r\nto time, as he had opportunity. One of his letters, written four years\r\nafter his arrival in the Dairy Plains, contained the most important news\r\nhe had yet had occasion to send of the state of himself and his family.\r\n\r\n  “Respected Sir,\r\n\r\n    “I have often thought and called myself bold in what I have said to\r\n  you in my letters, but you have always taken it kindly. This kindness\r\n  makes me more bold than ever, especially as to two things that I am\r\n  going to write about, when I have a little explained our present\r\n  condition.\r\n\r\n  “My employer and I are about to part; which you will be surprised to\r\n  hear, as there is a full year remaining of the time I bound myself to\r\n  serve. It is through no quarrel, however; Mr. Stapleton having been a\r\n  good master to me, unless for wanting more work out of me than mortal\r\n  arm could do; for which, however, he was always willing to pay me\r\n  well. The fact is, sir, he is a daring and a bustling man, such as\r\n  they say are always to be found in new countries, wanting, as soon as\r\n  they have got all pretty comfortable about them, to go further into\r\n  the wilds and begin again. I see the good of there being such men, but\r\n  do not wish to be one; so, when Stapleton offered me any wages I liked\r\n  to go with him, I said ‘No,’ having only engaged to serve him on this\r\n  spot; and thus I find myself at liberty a year sooner than I expected.\r\n  He offered me an introduction that would get me good terms from the\r\n  gentleman that has taken his pretty place; but not knowing yet what\r\n  sort of person he is, and there being, thank God! far more work in my\r\n  way to be done at any price than I can get through, I wish to keep\r\n  myself free. To finish about myself first,—I am building a sort of\r\n  double house, in the middle of a very pretty piece of land. One end of\r\n  the house is for myself, and the other for my father, against his time\r\n  is up. It would do your heart good, sir, to see how he has everything\r\n  comfortable about him, though he goes on complaining, to be sure, that\r\n  this is not the old country. My step-mother too has succeeded finely\r\n  with her fruit this year, and there is as good cider of hers in every\r\n  cottage as any in Worcestershire, and such flowers as she grows make\r\n  the place look like a paradise.\r\n\r\n  “Allow me now, sir, to go on as if we were talking as we have often\r\n  done over the churchyard gate, or by your door; and not as if this\r\n  letter had to travel over the wide sea before it reaches you. I should\r\n  like to know whether it has ever happened to you to fancy gentlemen\r\n  like yourself coming over to this place? I am sure, if such would\r\n  think of it, it would be the best thing for the society here, and\r\n  might prove so to themselves, in cases where they are not very well\r\n  off, and have little to leave that they care for. You make no secret,\r\n  sir, of its being difficult for your family to live on such a curacy\r\n  as yours, and you have even talked of settling your sons abroad as\r\n  they grow up. If you would send them,—or (what is better) bring them\r\n  here,—they shall be made welcome, and watched over and taken care of\r\n  as they ought to be by those who owe so much to their father. Indeed,\r\n  sir, this might prove a pleasant settlement in a very few years to you\r\n  and yours. There are now eleven farms and other dwellings within three\r\n  miles, and more building every year; and Launceston is within reach.\r\n  The people about us are mostly very intelligent, and it is a good sign\r\n  that they are crying out continually for a settled clergyman and a\r\n  school; and, if we cannot get so much, for a library. You would find a\r\n  good house, with a stable, and a horse in it; a garden, and two or\r\n  three fields; a school-room with five-and-twenty scholars, whose\r\n  parents would pay you well both for your teaching and your Sunday\r\n  services. We should ask you too, to choose a little library at our\r\n  expense, and should add to it, under your direction, every year; so\r\n  that your children as well as those of the settlers should have every\r\n  advantage. You will find further particulars of what we can offer you\r\n  in the public letter which accompanies this.\r\n\r\n  “My fear is, that the consideration of the young ladies will deter\r\n  you, should you otherwise be disposed to listen to our plan; and,\r\n  indeed, England seems at first sight the best place for daughters that\r\n  have lost their mother. But I have great hopes that these plains may\r\n  be like an English county before your young ladies have grown up. When\r\n  once gentlemen, especially clergymen, begin to come, more follow; and\r\n  this is all we want to make the Dairy Plains like parts of Sussex or\r\n  Dorsetshire. We have specimens of each class, up to the thriving\r\n  farmer and wool-grower. There is also a surveyor, and a surgeon is\r\n  coming, they say; though he is the last person wanted, except for an\r\n  accident now and then, for we really have no sickness. If, in addition\r\n  to these, we could have over a tanner or two, a coal-master, a\r\n  vine-grower, a store-keeper, and so on, each with his proper\r\n  labourers, ours would be as flourishing a settlement as any in the\r\n  world. There is coal in plenty, and a fine market in every direction,\r\n  if we had but people to work it; and the same may be said of slate,\r\n  and bark, and hides. Some Portuguese vine-dressers are making a fine\r\n  thing of a vineyard in the south of the island; and why not here,\r\n  instead of our having to import spirits in such quantities as make\r\n  drunkards of too many of our labourers? The commoner sorts of wine we\r\n  might make would soon drive out spirits, to our great benefit in every\r\n  way. As for clothing, utensils, and other things that are brought to\r\n  great perfection and cheapness in England, we had better go on buying\r\n  there; and I have no doubt they will be as glad of our productions as\r\n  we of their manufactures. You will be pleased to hear that there are\r\n  already twenty-six vessels belonging to the island, and that upwards\r\n  of thirty traded with us from Great Britain last year; and that\r\n  1,000,000 lbs. of wool were sent there within the twelve months. All\r\n  these things I mention to show what a rising country this is, and how\r\n  well worth the while of many a man above the rank of labourers and\r\n  artizans to come to. If you should think of doing so, sir, it would be\r\n  the best piece of news that could reach the Dairy Plains from any part\r\n  of the world. You should have the heartiest welcome from some whom you\r\n  are pleased to call old friends.\r\n\r\n  “Perhaps, sir, you may remember saying something to me about the\r\n  difficulty of getting a wife here. I have never tried, because there\r\n  was one in England, as you know, that I always hoped might keep\r\n  herself single till we should agree that she should follow me out.\r\n  Through all these long four years we have had this in view, and now I\r\n  shall have a house ready for her by the time she can come; and this is\r\n  the other liberty I told you I was about to take. If you should really\r\n  come, perhaps, knowing her steadiness so well, you would let her cross\r\n  with you, waiting on the young ladies during the voyage, for the\r\n  expense of which I will be answerable. Whether you join us or not, I\r\n  have little doubt you will kindly put her in the way of coming with\r\n  the least possible delay; and you may depend on my meeting her before\r\n  she lands.\r\n\r\n  “I have said nothing of Ellen, because you will see her letter to\r\n  grandfather. I have left it to her to send money this time, as I have\r\n  other use, you see, for my own.\r\n\r\n  “It is a load off my mind, sir, to have written what has been deep\r\n  down in it for so long. It is a great while to wait for an answer; and\r\n  if there should be disappointment both ways, I hardly know how I shall\r\n  bear it. But I am pretty sure of what is to me the chief thing; and if\r\n  you come too, I wonder what we can manage to find to wish for next. It\r\n  pleased God to give Ellen and me our hardships early, and to take us\r\n  out of them before our hearts and tempers were hurt; like so many at\r\n  home, better perhaps than ourselves. If He should try us any more, we\r\n  have good reason now to be patient; and in the meanwhile, we desire to\r\n  save others from what we had to go through for a short time, and\r\n  therefore write as we do about coming over.\r\n\r\n                                                      ”FRANK CASTLE.\r\n\r\n  “P.S. There are fine downs here for the young gentlemen to fly their\r\n  kites, just behind the house you would have. Ellen will take care that\r\n  Miss Maria shall have a pretty poultry-yard; and Susan is taming an\r\n  opossum mouse for the other little lady.”\r\n\r\nThe many months which necessarily elapsed before an answer to the above\r\ncould be received did indeed seem long; almost as much so to Frank’s\r\nfamily as to himself. Ellen had made a request scarcely less important\r\nthan Frank’s to the happiness of her parents, if not to her own. She had\r\nalways been convinced that the child which had been sent to the\r\nworkhouse by the parish surgeon of A—— was her stepmother’s; and it had\r\never been her resolution to yield a sister’s protection to it. Harry\r\nMoore was as willing as herself to have the child over; and as the boy\r\nwas now only five years old, there was hope that he might prove an\r\nexception to the general rule of the corruption of parish-bred children.\r\nFrank’s betrothed was requested to bring him out with her; and if Mrs.\r\nCastle was still disinclined to own him, he was to take his place as the\r\neldest of Harry Moore’s children. There was not a man, woman, or child\r\nin the neighbourhood that did not see the importance of having a\r\nclergyman’s family come among them; and by all, therefore, Mr. Jackson’s\r\nreply was looked for as the oracle which was to decide whether their\r\nsettlement might immediately rise to that degree of prosperity which is\r\ncaused by the union of high civilization with universal plenty, or\r\nwhether it must remain for some time longer in the rude state which is\r\never the consequence of a scarcity of knowledge and of leisure. The\r\nparents began already to teach their children the alphabet and the\r\nmultiplication table, during the evenings of the week, and as many hymns\r\nas they could recollect on Sundays. The little ones already began to\r\nplay keeping school; and the travelling chaplain was told, week by week,\r\nhow much pleasanter he would find his occasional visits when there\r\nshould be a resident pastor on the spot, more worthy to converse with\r\nhim than any of his flock. A part of the Sunday leisure was spent by\r\nmany in repairing to the field where Mr. Jackson’s house was to be; and\r\nthen what planning there was about the garden, and the stand of\r\nbee-hives, and the paddock, and every other appendage to the parsonage!\r\nSome of the lads were training a pony for the young Jacksons, and the\r\nrarest and finest plants were destined for their flower-beds.\r\n\r\nThe answer was expected to arrive in May, and every one hoped it would\r\nbe before the anniversary;—that celebration of the arrival of the\r\nemigrants in a land of plenty which has already been spoken of as the\r\nbest of their festivals. It happened to arrive on that very day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                           TRUE CITIZENSHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nBright and busy were the mornings of these anniversaries;—each busier\r\nand brighter than the last, as the families of the settlers grew in\r\nnumbers and prosperity. The labourers and mechanics who had arrived in\r\nthe same waggon with the Castles had found wives or had them over, and\r\nnow came thronging with their infants, bringing also the new comers of\r\ntheir craft, or in their employ; so that it was found necessary to\r\nspread a greater length of table every year under the shade where they\r\ndined, and to provide a larger treat of game.\r\n\r\nThere was more bustle than usual this time, from Stapleton having chosen\r\nthis very morning for his departure to the new territory where he meant\r\nto establish a lodge in the wilderness. As it was a holiday, several\r\nneighbours followed in his train for a few miles; and when obliged to\r\nturn back, gave three cheers to their departing neighbour, and three to\r\nhim who was to be his successor in the abode which had grown up\r\nflourishing before their eyes, and was the chief ornament of their\r\nsettlement. Frank joined in these cheers, and then told his companions\r\nthat he would follow them home in an hour, as Mr. Stapleton had still\r\nsome more directions to give, and wished for his company a little\r\nfarther.—When Frank reappeared at noon, he looked so grave and had\r\nsuddenly become so silent that everybody was struck, and his sister\r\nalarmed. He hastily reminded her that it was post-day; and said he was\r\ngoing himself to meet the postman, and would be back before dinner was\r\non table. Three or four holiday-folks went with him; and none wondered\r\nthat he looked grave on hearing the sentence “No letters for the Dairy\r\nPlains.” Before they were half-way back, some of the acuter ears among\r\nthe party caught the welcome and very rare sound of waggon wheels in\r\ntheir rear. In course of time, the vehicle appeared briskly approaching\r\non the Launceston road, and Frank sprang eagerly forward to gaze in the\r\nfaces of the passengers. All were strange; and these repeated\r\ndisappointments left him no heart to hail the travellers. His companions\r\ndid so, however; and the reply was that these were labourers from\r\nEngland, some bound to Stapleton’s successor, and others on their way to\r\na settlement further on.\r\n\r\n“What part of England were they from?” “Kent and Surrey.” “Did they\r\nbring letters for the Dairy Plains?” “Plenty; and something besides\r\nletters.” So saying, they exhibited a little boy, the very image of\r\nJerry at five years old. Frank silently caught him up in his arms, and\r\ncarried him on without asking another question; the dreary conviction\r\nhaving struck him that as this child was sent alone, none of the others\r\nhe wished for were coming.\r\n\r\nLittle passed between himself and Ellen, who was on the watch.\r\n\r\n“Here is the child, Ellen. May he be a blessing to you!”\r\n\r\n“Is he alone? No letters? No message? Or worse than none?”\r\n\r\n“There are letters, but I have not got them from these people yet. They\r\ncannot be good, you know, or why——”\r\n\r\nHe could not go on. Ellen ran to beg the particular favour of the\r\ntravellers to get out the letters immediately. This was easily done, the\r\npackages of the labourers being small; and before Frank was called upon\r\nto carve for a few dozen hungry people, he had satisfied himself that it\r\nwas very childish and ungrateful to have been so soon cast down; and his\r\ngravity was seen by those who watched him to be of a very different\r\ncharacter from that which had seized him three hours before.\r\n\r\nIt was not Ellen’s wish that the little workhouse child should meet his\r\nparents for the first time in the presence of strangers. Knowing that\r\nCastle and his wife were gathering fruit in their garden, she took the\r\nboy there, (after having brushed the dust from his clothes, and set him\r\noff to the best advantage,) and put him in at the gate, bidding him not\r\nto be frightened if he was spoken to, but say where he came from. The\r\nlittle fellow made no advances. He stood in the middle of the walk, with\r\na finger of each hand in his mouth, and his chin upon his breast. He had\r\nnot yet learned work-house impudence.\r\n\r\nCastle was the first to see him, after stooping so long over his peaches\r\nthat Ellen began to fear the blindness was wilful. “Wife! Wife!” she at\r\nlength heard him call. “He is come! The boy is come!” Ellen just staid\r\nto hear the words “my boy” from both, and stole away. The next time she\r\nsaw him was as he came between his parents to the dinner table,\r\nchattering in his Kentish dialect, and asking to sit on his father’s\r\nknee, and be treated with fruit by his mother.\r\n\r\n“You must be satisfied with being his brother, Harry,” said Ellen to her\r\nhusband. “He does not need to go begging for a father.”\r\n\r\nAmong the toasts which were given after dinner, some one proposed Mr.\r\nStapleton’s successor, whose name it was strange enough that nobody had\r\nbeen able to learn till this day; and perhaps it was not less remarkable\r\nthat the name was the same with that of some respected persons now\r\npresent. They would all fill their cans to the health of Mr. Robert\r\nCastle, about to become their neighbour.\r\n\r\nIt did not seem to occur to anybody who this Robert Castle was, till the\r\ngloom was seen to have settled over Frank’s countenance as black as\r\never. Then the rest of the family looked at one another in wonder and\r\ndismay. Frank’s companions on either hand asked him if he was asleep, or\r\nwhat had come over him that he did not fill his can. He immediately\r\naddressed the party, relating that he had been requested by Mr.\r\nStapleton to inform the present company that the proprietor who was\r\ncoming among them did not approve of such festivals as they were now\r\nholding; that he had purposely kept away till the present one was over,\r\nand hoped to hear of no more anniversaries.—This announcement occasioned\r\na great uproar, which Frank quieted by observing that so absurd an\r\ninterference as this need not be regarded otherwise than with silent\r\ncontempt; that, whatever reasons the person in question might have for\r\ndisliking such a celebration as theirs, he had nothing to do with the\r\nway in which they chose to remember the country of their birth, and to\r\nbe thankful for the blessings of that in which they now lived. He\r\ntherefore proposed, sure of being cheerfully pledged by every one around\r\nhim, “Many happy returns to all present of this remarkable festival.”\r\n\r\nNo wonder Frank had looked grave after bidding farewell to Stapleton,\r\nwhen the last news he heard from him was, that his successor was no\r\nother than Bob the convict, whose ambition was so far gratified that he\r\nwas able to take on lease the little estate on which his virtuous elder\r\nbrother had till now worked for hire. So much, as he observed, for his\r\nhaving been favoured with a free passage! His family were obliged to\r\nreconcile themselves to seeing him climb over their heads in this way.\r\nThey reminded one another that they had made up their minds to the\r\npresence of convicts, as the one great evil attending emigration to Van\r\nDiemen’s Land, and that they must not now begin to complain because one\r\nof these convicts was a son and brother. What their intercourse with him\r\nwas to be, or whether there was to be any, they left to be decided by\r\ncircumstances when he should appear.\r\n\r\nA hearty welcome being offered to the Kentish and Surrey folks just\r\narrived, they gave some account of themselves. They had all suffered\r\nfrom want of demand for their labour; an evil which had gone on to\r\nincrease in the face of the promises that had been made to them about\r\nproviding for all who were out of work on farms prepared for their\r\nadvantage alone. A young labourer from the parish of A—— stated that his\r\nfather and mother and their seven children had been located on such a\r\nfarm by Mr. Fellowes, with sixty other families; that it was difficult\r\nto provide for all the young people as they grew up, and would become\r\nmore so still when they came to have families of their own, unless\r\nindeed they spent their whole lives in getting food and food only. Mr.\r\nFellowes was now anxious to take in more paupers upon his farm, and was\r\nunwilling, in order to make room for them, to turn out labourers upon\r\nthe parish where there were already too many; and he had therefore\r\nadvised the sons and daughters of his home-settlers to lose no\r\nopportunity of getting well placed either in Canada or Australia. “So,”\r\nconcluded the speaker, “I moved off to make room for two elderly folks,\r\nseeing, as Mr. Fellowes himself said, that I can raise a better living\r\nwith less toil here than there, and be much sooner free; and so, here I\r\nam. But Mr. Jackson will tell you all about it, when he comes, better\r\nthan I can.”\r\n\r\nIt was now Frank’s turn to explain that the clergyman and his family\r\nwere really coming, and to read that part of his long letter which\r\nconcerned the present company.—He had often thought of coming, the\r\ngentleman wrote, and had nearly made up his mind to it before the\r\ninvitation arrived from some of his former flock; and the inducements\r\nheld out by them had quite decided him.—And now what cheering, what long\r\nand loud congratulation followed!\r\n\r\n“What are you shaking your head for, Castle?” inquired one who sat\r\nopposite to him. “You cannot altogether help smiling; so why spoil sport\r\nwith shaking your head? What are you sorry for?”\r\n\r\n“I am not sorry. I am very glad. I am only afraid of Mr. Jackson’s\r\ngrowing sorry, and that in a very little while. After all, you see, this\r\nis not the old country.”\r\n\r\n“No more is the coat on your back an old coat; and how is it the worse\r\nfor that?”\r\n\r\n“Tush! Stuff! One’s coat has nothing to do with one’s happiness, as\r\none’s country has. England is one’s home after all.”\r\n\r\n“Not mine, I am sure. It was a dreary place enough to me,—nothing like a\r\nhome. I and mine were neglected or oppressed at every turn; not because\r\nanybody meant us harm; but like starving people who happen to be just so\r\nmany more than are needed. Here I have all I want without begging or\r\nreturning thanks; and this is my home. Wherever I have a dwelling and\r\nfood, wherever I have comfort and safety within doors, and can step\r\nabroad among friends, there is my home. Put me under a parish roof in\r\nthe very spot I was born in, and I should feel like a banished man. Set\r\nme down independent, with my family about me, in any part of the\r\nworld,—in the middle of a forest or on the wildest sea-shore, and, be it\r\nnorth, south, east, or west, that place is a home to me.”\r\n\r\nCastle still shook his head, saying that there was no place like England\r\nto an Englishman.\r\n\r\n“Aye; if you could be as well off in England as you are here, I grant\r\nyou. But just answer me this,—if you and your family could be set down\r\nthis very day before the workhouse at A—, in the condition in which you\r\ndrove away from it, would you go?”\r\n\r\nCastle stole a glance at his children and hesitated to reply.—To spare\r\nhis father, Frank observed that Mr. Jackson had a good deal to say on\r\nthis subject, and proceeded to finish the letter, the auditory showing\r\nby their silence during its progress and their enthusiasm at its\r\nconclusion, that they were partly sensible of the greatness of the\r\noccasion, as well as prepared to enter into his opinions and feelings.\r\nSeveral of them, besides Frank and others who personally knew Mr.\r\nJackson, felt that a new era in the prosperity of the settlement at\r\nDairy Plains was likely to begin from this day;—for their correspondent\r\nmight be said to be already among them.\r\n\r\nAfter discussing the details of his removal, his letter proceeded thus:—\r\n\r\n“My first consideration was, as you suppose, for my children; and long\r\nand anxiously did I consider, as it will be a comfort to as many of you\r\nas have families to know. The only way to settle such a question is, to\r\nascertain what are the objects of human life. This done, it is easy to\r\nsettle where those objects may be best attained. What I desire for my\r\nsons and daughters is that life should train them to the greatest degree\r\nof benevolence and integrity, out of which is sure to spring the highest\r\nkind of piety; and these things, with outward plenty, make happiness.\r\nNow, it seems to me that that benevolence is of the most kindly and\r\nabundant sort which subsists among happy people; and that integrity is\r\nmost secure where the interests of all are the same, instead of being\r\nopposed. I think that not all the advantages of society and what is\r\ncommonly called education, which my children could have in England, will\r\nset against the freedom from temptation and from the corrupting sights\r\nof human misery which must there come in their way; poor as they must be\r\nhere, and condemned to jostle their way in the world, and probably to\r\nlose a step or two of the rank which their father’s profession leads\r\nthem to consider as their own. Education is made up of many things\r\nbesides books, and even cultivated society; and I am much mistaken if,\r\nwith such a field of exertion before them, and such motives to it, with\r\nabundance of God’s blessings and beauties poured out around them, in the\r\nmidst of an affectionate and thriving people, and with their father at\r\nhand to teach much which they could not otherwise learn, the intellects\r\nof my sons and daughters may not become of a much higher order than they\r\ncould amidst the struggle for subsistence which they must sustain at\r\nhome. I judge for none but those who are circumstanced like myself; but\r\nI certainly feel that those who have several children for whom they can\r\nprovide nothing more than that sort of education which will not be of\r\nuse to them in a competition for bread, are the right persons to go\r\nabroad and make their home where, at the sacrifice of some of the\r\nprivileges of high civilization, none of the troubles and moral evils of\r\npoverty can enter.\r\n\r\n“You will have heard that Mr. Fellowes finds his well-meant plans\r\nsomewhat difficult to manage, from the vast increase of claimants. I\r\nbelieve he still thinks that if there were People’s Farms enough, the\r\nrelief might be made effectual, though he cannot explain what is to be\r\ndone with so many delvers a hundred years hence, and will not say\r\nwhether we are all to become delvers and spinners rather than a few of\r\nus cross the world to a more fruitful land. Your grandparents seem to\r\nlike their settlement on his farm, and their employment of looking after\r\nsome of the orphan children, and teaching them to dig and spin. Your\r\npresents and Ellen’s give them great pleasure, and add to their stock of\r\nlittle comforts. They sigh for you sometimes; and no wonder: but they\r\nconsole themselves with saying that your father will end his days among\r\na thriving set of grandchildren who need never fear want. Mr. Fellowes\r\nis glad, I am pleased to see, to have some of his farm labourers go\r\nabroad as opportunity offers; and some of these will convey this letter\r\nto you.—So many inquiries have already been addressed to me since my\r\ndetermination was known, that I have strong hopes that persons of\r\nvarious classes will soon be on their way to the Dairy Plains.—Wherever\r\ncolonization has succeeded best, the emigrating party has been composed\r\nof specimens of every rank and class; so that no one felt stripped of\r\nthe blessings of the mother-country, but rather that he moved away in\r\nthe midst of an entire though small society. If gentlemen go to one\r\nplace, and labourers to another, the settlement is sure to pine, like\r\nthat at the Swan River, and like too many more of the same kind.\r\nWhatever expense and trouble may be incurred in locating such imperfect\r\nmaterials of society must be well nigh lost. The true economy, the true\r\nbenevolence, the true wisdom, of emigration is to send out a company as\r\na swarm of bees goes forth,—under proper leaders, and in a state of\r\norganization. This is the doctrine I declare as often as I am\r\nquestioned; and I am trying to convince such capitalists as talk of\r\nemigrating that, if done in such a mode as this, their removal becomes\r\nmost like a removal from one county to another;—as if they went from\r\nNorfolk into Cumberland, or from Lancashire into the new scenery of\r\nDevonshire. Let us hope that some of them will make the trial.\r\n\r\n“The greatest surprise to me is that some still go on talking of its\r\nbeing unpatriotic to leave one’s country. Surely it is patriotic to do\r\nwhatever most benefits one’s country; and it is pretty clear that it is\r\na benefit to rid ours of thousands of her burdensome children, to the\r\ngreat advantage, instead of injury, of her colonies. After all, a state\r\nis made up of individual members; and, therefore, whatever most benefits\r\nthose individuals must benefit the state. Our duty to the state and our\r\nduty to ourselves are not opposing duties; if they were, there would\r\neither be no patriots, or no one would thrive. On the contrary, a man’s\r\nchief duty to his country is to provide honestly and abundantly, if he\r\ncan, for himself and his family; and when this cannot be done at home,\r\nit is a breach of duty to stay and eat up other men’s substance there,\r\nif a living can be had elsewhere. But I need not argue this matter with\r\nyou, who have seen and adopted the true patriotism. I and mine will come\r\nand try what we can do to make the name of our native land honoured in\r\ndistant regions as it is in our own hearts: and when the reckoning comes\r\nto be made of what, as a community, we of the Dairy Plains have done for\r\nthe state of which we are members, let it be clear that we have loved\r\nand served her all the better for being removed from the gates of her\r\nworkhouses into one of the palaces which God himself has built for her.”\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n          _Summary of Principles illustrated in this Volume._\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of colonization have been adopted by the British\r\nEmpire;—Colonization for the reduction of our home-population,—or\r\nVoluntary Emigration;—and Penal Colonization.\r\n\r\nThe term Colonization is by some applied to a third process, which they\r\nwish to see introduced into this country; viz.—Home Colonization.\r\n\r\nThe objects of Voluntary Emigration, directed by the state, are\r\nthreefold.\r\n\r\n1st. To improve the condition of those who emigrate, by placing them\r\nwhere they may obtain subsistence at less cost than at home.\r\n\r\n2d. To improve the condition of those who remain, by increasing the\r\nratio of capital to population.\r\n\r\n3d. To improve the condition of the colonized region.\r\n\r\nTo fulfil the 1st of these objects, the colony must be so located as to\r\ninsure health and abundance to its members; and it must be so organized\r\nas to secure the due co-operation of labour and capital.\r\n\r\nTo fulfil the 2d object, the removal of each individual must be less\r\ncostly than his maintenance at home would be; and the selection must be\r\nmade with a view to lessening the amount of human productiveness at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nTo fulfil the 3d object, the colonists must be selected with a view to\r\ntheir productiveness, both as regards capital and population; which\r\nincludes a moral fitness to compose an orderly society.\r\n\r\nIt follows from all these considerations that a new settlement should be\r\ncomposed of young, healthy, and moral persons; that all should not be\r\nlabourers, nor all capitalists; and that there should be a sufficient\r\nconcentration of their numbers on the new lands to insure a facility of\r\nexchanges.\r\n\r\nHome colonies may afford a temporary relief to a redundant population,\r\nand also increase the productiveness of the lands which they\r\nappropriate; but this is done by alienating capital from its natural\r\nchannels; and with the certainty of ultimately injuring society by\r\nincreasing the redundancy of population over capital.\r\n\r\nHome colonization then, though less injurious than the unproductive\r\ndistribution of the Charity-fund, is inferior to foreign colonization,\r\ninasmuch as the one yields temporary benefit to a few at the expense of\r\nultimate injury to many; and the other produces permanent benefit to\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe objects of Penal Colonization are,\r\n\r\n1st. The security of society by the removal of the offender.\r\n\r\n2d. The security of society by the effect of his example.\r\n\r\n3d. The reformation of the offender.\r\n\r\nThere has hitherto been an entire failure of all these objects. And no\r\nwonder; since,\r\n\r\n1st. The offender is only transferred from one portion of society to\r\nanother: and besides, frequently returns to his old haunts.\r\n\r\n2d. His punishment, as far as it is punishment, takes place at too great\r\na distance to be conspicuous as a warning; and in as far as his lot does\r\nnot involve punishment, the effect of his example is precisely the\r\nreverse of what is desired.\r\n\r\n3d. Our convict arrangements tend to the further corruption of the\r\noffender, by letting him experience a great improvement in his condition\r\nas a direct consequence of his crimes.\r\n\r\nThe junction of penal with voluntary emigration tends equally to\r\ndisappoint the purposes of the one, and to extinguish the benefits of\r\nthe other; since convict labourers find themselves in a state of\r\nprivilege, in a region where their labour procures them large rewards;\r\nand new settlers find their community deeply injured by the vice and\r\ndisease consequent on the introduction of a convict population.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                                FOR EACH\r\n                                  AND\r\n                                FOR ALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               =A Tale.=\r\n\r\n                                   BY\r\n\r\n                           HARRIET MARTINEAU.\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n                                LONDON:\r\n                   CHARLES FOX, 67, PATERNOSTER-ROW.\r\n\r\n                                  ---\r\n\r\n                                  832.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n                                  ---\r\n\r\n         1.

At the\r\nclubs, in the shops, in drawing-rooms and boudoirs, it was related that\r\nlady F——’s debut would take place on the 20th. Her first appearance on a\r\nnew stage,—her return from a tour in the provinces,—her first night in a\r\nnew character, all were referred to the 20th, in a manner which should\r\nprevent any one forgetting that lady F—— had quitted a profession on her\r\nmarriage. The curiosity was not confined to mothers and daughters, to\r\nwhose observation an extraordinary marriage is the most exciting\r\ncircumstance that life affords: in this case, the interest was shared by\r\ntheir husbands and fathers. Some wondered how the proud old earl would\r\nstand the introduction of his daughter-in-law into his own society; and\r\nothers, who had told lord F—— that he was a lucky fellow to have won\r\nsuch a glorious creature, speculated, notwithstanding, on the\r\nawkwardnesses and difficulties which must hourly arise from the choice\r\nof one so far below him in rank. He was an odd personage, however,—lord\r\nF——; and there was no telling how he would think and feel on occasions\r\nwhen everybody else felt alike. On the whole, greater sympathy was\r\nexpressed for his sister, lady Frances, who was more likely to be\r\nmortified,—who certainly was more mortified at the connexion than the\r\nrest of her family. Her father was understood to have insisted on her\r\nmaking the best of the affair, since it could not be helped; but,\r\nwhatever her outward demeanour might appear, it would be too hard upon\r\nher to suppose that she could do more than barely keep on terms with a\r\nsister-in-law who had been on the stage. A solitary voice here and there\r\nreminded the speculators how it was that lady F—— had adopted a\r\nprofession, and asked whether the connexion would have been thought very\r\npreposterous if she had been known only as the highly educated daughter\r\nof an eminent merchant; or whether the marvellousness of the case rested\r\non her father’s misfortunes, and her choice of a way of life when he was\r\nno longer living to support and protect her: but these questions met\r\nwith no other answer than that such a marriage was so very strange an\r\none that the speculators longed to see how all the parties carried it\r\noff; though, to be sure, such beauty as lady F——’s went a great way\r\ntowards making the thing easy;—almost as far as her husband’s\r\ncarelessness of the opinion of the world.—Meanwhile, who had seen her\r\nriding in the park? Was she more or less beautiful than on the stage?\r\nWas lady Frances with her? Who had called, and who had not? How was it\r\nto be the fashion to treat her? And so forth.\r\n\r\nHow much did all this signify to lord and lady F——, to the earl, and to\r\nlady Frances? The bride fancied little, and feared nothing. She had been\r\nconversant with many ranks of society, and had found them all composed\r\nof men and women; and she never doubted that in that with which she was\r\nabout to become acquainted, she should also have to deal with men and\r\nwomen. Her husband guessed what speculations were going on, and did not\r\ncare for them. The earl also knew, and did care, as did lady Frances;\r\nbut they disposed differently of their anxieties; the earl repressing\r\nthem in order to the best disposition of circumstances which he could\r\nnot prevent; his daughter allowing them to fill her mind, appear in her\r\nmanners, and form a part of her conversation with her intimate friends.\r\n\r\nLady F—— and her husband dined alone on the day of the Duke of A——’s\r\nball. As the bride entered her dressing-room, she met her lady’s-maid\r\nfidgeting about near the door.\r\n\r\n“O, dear, my lady,” said Philips, “I am glad you are come. I was just\r\ngoing to take the liberty of venturing to send Thérèse, to remind your\r\nladyship how very late it is growing. It would scarcely be justice,\r\neither to myself or your ladyship, to cramp us for time in our first\r\ntoilet; and I was not able so much as to lay out your dress; for Thérèse\r\nwas so idle, I find, as not to have ascertained what your ladyship\r\nintends to wear.”\r\n\r\n“I have been so idle as not to have made up my own mind yet, Philips.\r\nThere is abundance of time, however, if you are no longer dressing my\r\nhair than Thérèse and I shall be about the rest.”\r\n\r\nPhilips immediately looked very solemn; and though the toilet lamps were\r\nduly lighted, and all was ready for her operations, she stood with her\r\narms by her side, in the attitude of waiting.\r\n\r\n“Well, Philips, I am ready.”\r\n\r\n“Will you please, my lady, to send Thérèse and her work elsewhere? It\r\ncannot be expected that I should exhibit my ways so as a mere novice may\r\nsupplant me any day, my lady.”\r\n\r\n“This is Thérèse’s proper place, and here she shall stay,” replied the\r\nlady. “However, she shall read to us; and then, you know, she cannot be\r\na spy upon your doings.”\r\n\r\nThérèse read accordingly till the hair was dressed. At the first pause,\r\nPhilips observed that she must brush up her French, her fluency in which\r\nshe had lost from having missed the advantage of visiting Paris last\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n“Thérèse will be obliged to any one who will talk with her in her own\r\ntongue, Philips. Suppose, instead of having fancies about supplanting\r\none another, you make the best use you can of each other, since you must\r\nbe a good deal together.”\r\n\r\n“I will do my best, I am sure, my lady, to instruct the girl in all that\r\nrelates to her own sphere, without encroaching on mine. I will do my\r\nbest to reform her dress, which really bespeaks her to be a\r\ngreen-grocer’s daughter, if I may venture to say so. But as to dressing\r\nhair,—allow me to appeal to lady Frances whether it can be expected that\r\nI should disseminate my principles out of my own sphere.”\r\n\r\n“See who knocks, Thérèse.”\r\n\r\nThe earl and lady Frances were below, and lady Frances would be\r\nparticularly glad to speak to Mrs. Philips, if not engaged with my lady.\r\nMrs. Philips, at her lady’s desire, went to receive her late mistress’s\r\ncommands, and Thérèse enacted the lady’s-maid, as she had done from the\r\ntime she had left Paris in lady F——’s train.\r\n\r\n“Come, Thérèse, let us have done before anybody arrives to criticise us\r\nnovices. How nervous you look, child! What is the difference between\r\ndressing me to-day and any other day?”\r\n\r\n“There is no toilet in travelling, madame,—no fêtes like this; and in\r\nthe inns there was so much less grandeur than here. I have not been\r\neducated to serve you, like Mrs. Philips, or to live in a great house.—I\r\nam more fit to sew for you, madame, or read to you, than to help you\r\ninstead of Mrs. Philips.”\r\n\r\n“I do not want two Mrs. Philipses, you know; and as for the grandeur you\r\nspeak of,—if we do not find it comfortable, we will have done with it.\r\nWhat have we too much of,—of light, or of warmth, or of drawers and\r\ndressing boxes, or of books? You like old china, and I like old\r\npictures, and here are both. Which of all these things do you wish\r\naway?”\r\n\r\n“O, none of them, I dare say, when I grow used to them: but they are so\r\nlittle like my father’s house! I felt the inns very grand at first, but\r\nthey are bare and tarnished, compared with what we have here.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. You would have been glad of such a rug as this under your feet in\r\nthose cold rooms at Amiens; and I should have liked such a mirror as\r\nthis instead of one so cracked, that one half of my face looked as if it\r\ncould not possibly fit the other. I see much to like and nothing to be\r\nafraid of in rugs and mirrors.”\r\n\r\n“You, madame, no! You are made to have the best of everything come to\r\nyou of its own accord; and you know how to use everything. You....”\r\n\r\n“And yet, Thérèse, I was once as poor as you, and poorer. If I know how\r\nto use things, and if, as you say, they come to me of the best, it is\r\nbecause I think first what they were made for, and not what they are\r\ntaken as signs of. If, instead of enjoying the luxuries of my house, I\r\nwere to look upon them as showing that I am lady F——, I should be apt to\r\ntry to behave as people think lady F—— should behave; and then I should\r\nbe awkward. Now, if you consider all the pretty things you have to use,\r\nnot as pointing you out as lady F——’s lady’s-maid, but as intended to\r\nmake me and my little friend comfortable, you will not be distressed\r\nabout being unlike Philips: you will know that I had rather see you the\r\nsame Thérèse that I always knew you.”\r\n\r\n“O, madame, this is being very good. But then, I cannot feel as you do,\r\nbecause there is more occasion for me to think about the change. There\r\nis my lord to take off your thoughts from such things; he is with you in\r\nevery new place, and you see how accustomed he is to everything that is\r\nstrange to you.”\r\n\r\n“That does make some difference certainly,” said the lady, smiling, “but\r\nthen you should consider how many more new places and people I have to\r\nmake acquaintance with than you. Except Philips, or two or three of the\r\nservants below, you have nobody to be afraid of, and I am never long\r\naway. You will feel yourself at ease in one room after another, and with\r\none person after another, till you will learn to do all your business,\r\nand speak all your thoughts, as simply and confidently as you once\r\nwatered the salads in your father’s shop, and made your confession to\r\ngood old father Bénoit.”\r\n\r\nThérèse sighed deeply, as she finished her task and withdrew to the\r\nfireside, as if no longer to detain her lady about her own affairs.\r\n\r\n“I have not forgotten, Thérèse, about finding a confessor for you. I am\r\nonly cautious lest we should not observe exactly your father’s\r\ndirections.”\r\n\r\n“Madame—they are so very particular!—that the priest should be a devout\r\nman, and very old and experienced in the confession of girls like me.”\r\n\r\n“I know; and we thought we had found such an one; but he has forgotten\r\nalmost all his French, and you could hardly confess in English. But make\r\nyourself easy; your conscience shall soon be relieved.—Good night.\r\nPhilips will sit up.... More work, do you want?—You may give Philips a\r\nFrench lesson. O, you have read all these books. Well: come with me into\r\nthe library, and I will find you more.”\r\n\r\nOn the stairs they met lord F——.\r\n\r\n“Where are you going, Letitia? Frances is closeted with Philips in the\r\nlibrary.”\r\n\r\nThérèse immediately stole back to the dressing-room; but before the\r\ncarriages drove off, she was furnished with a fresh volume wherewith to\r\nbe occupied when she should have made tea for Mrs. Philips and herself.\r\n\r\nThe earl had dreaded lest he should find Letitia nervous at the prospect\r\nof the formidable evening she was about to pass. His visit was meant to\r\nreassure her, and she understood the kindness of the intention, and\r\nshowed that she did. When lady Frances came in from her conference with\r\nPhilips, she found them side by side on the sofa,—Letitia quiet and\r\nself-possessed, and the earl regarding her with as much admiration as\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\n“I am sure you may be obliged to me for giving up Philips to you,” said\r\nlady Frances to Letitia. “She has dressed you beautifully to-night. Is\r\nnot she a treasure?”\r\n\r\n“A great treasure to you, Frances,” said her brother, “so pray take her\r\nback again. Letitia has one treasure of a maid in her dressing-room\r\nalready, and it is a pity she should rob you of yours.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed it is,” said lady F——. “Philips’s accomplishments are thrown\r\naway upon me, I am afraid. If you will allow her to give my little\r\nFrench girl a few lessons, I shall be just as much obliged to you, and\r\nshall not deprive you of your servant.”\r\n\r\nLady Frances protested; but her brother was peremptory, to her utter\r\nastonishment, for she had never known him speak of lady’s maids before,\r\nand would not have believed that he could ever learn one from another.\r\nShe did not perceive that he did not choose that his wife’s beauty\r\nshould be attributed to the art of her toilet.\r\n\r\nNot the slightest trace of trepidation was observable in the bride when\r\nshe alighted from her carriage, when her name was shouted up the\r\nstaircase, or when all who were within hearing turned to gaze as she\r\nentered the crowded saloon, leaning on the arm of the earl. There was\r\nsomething much more like girlish glee than fear in her countenance; for,\r\nthe truth was, Letitia had a taste for luxury, as all simple-minded\r\npersons would have, if their simplicity extended as far as a disregard\r\nof the factitious associations by which luxury is converted into an\r\nincumbrance. Having been early accustomed to so much of it as to excite\r\nthe taste, then deprived of it, then baulked and tantalized with the\r\ncoarse and tinsel imitation of it which had met her during her short\r\nprofessional course, it was with lively pleasure that she now greeted\r\nthe reality. The whole apparatus of festivity inspired her with\r\ninstantaneous joy:—the bowers of orange and rose trees, light, warmth\r\nand music together, the buzz of voices, and above all the chalked\r\nfloor,—all these set her spirits dancing. A single glance towards her\r\nhusband told him enough to have placed him perfectly at ease respecting\r\nthe affairs of the evening, even if he had been a man who could be\r\notherwise than at his ease. He knew perfectly well that it was\r\nimpossible for any one of good sense and taste not to admire and respect\r\nLetitia, and he cared little under what pretence others might depreciate\r\nher accomplishments.\r\n\r\n“Lady F—— is the star of the night, as every one is observing,” said an\r\nold friend of the earl’s, who was absorbed in watching the dancers,\r\namong whom was Letitia. “The brightest star, we all agree, and shining\r\nas if in her native sphere.”\r\n\r\n“This is her native sphere,” replied the earl. “She is in her own sphere\r\nwherever there is grace, wherever there is enjoyment.”\r\n\r\n“True: so young, so simple as she appears! She seems perfectly\r\nunspoiled.”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly. She has gone through too much to be easily spoiled.\r\nChange,—anything more than modification—is impossible in her case, do\r\nwith her what you will. You are an old friend, and I have no objection\r\nto let you see that I am proud of Letitia.”\r\n\r\n“I am truly glad.... I felt uncertain.... I did not know....”\r\n\r\n“Nor I till to-night,” said the earl, smiling. “But I find I have no\r\nmore wish than right to question my son’s choice.”\r\n\r\n“But you must expect the world to criticise it.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. If my son acts so as to imply contempt of conventional\r\nmarriages, there will be contempt cast on his marriage of love. If both\r\nparties carry off their contempt inoffensively, both are welcome to\r\ntheir opinions.”\r\n\r\n“Well! there are many here whose parents have had occasion to use your\r\nphilosophy, or some other to answer the same purpose.”\r\n\r\n“Lady F—— is the star of the night,” observed lady Frances’s partner,\r\ngazing at Letitia through his glass. “Peerless indeed!”\r\n\r\nLady Frances made no answer, which emboldened the gentleman to proceed.\r\n\r\n“The star of the night, as she has often been called, and never more\r\njustly. Never, in the proudest moment of her glory, was she more\r\nlovely.”\r\n\r\nStill lady Frances was silent.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps your ladyship feels this to be the night of her glory; and,\r\nindeed, it is a triumph to have risen, through her own radiance, into a\r\nhigher sphere.”\r\n\r\n“I question whether she feels it so,” replied lady Frances. “Letitia is\r\nvery proud, and her pride takes rather an odd turn. She would tell you\r\nthat she considers it a condescension to come among us, who are only\r\nborn to our station.”\r\n\r\n“Surprising! And what inspired her condescension?”\r\n\r\n“O, love, of course; pure love. Nothing else could have prevailed with\r\nher to submit to marriage. You should hear her talk of the condition of\r\nwives,—how she pitied all till she became one herself. You cannot\r\nconceive what poor slaves she thinks them.”\r\n\r\n“And what says lord F——?”\r\n\r\n“He is fired by her eloquence. You have no idea how eloquent she is. She\r\npours it out as if....”\r\n\r\n“It was in her heart, as well as by heart. How will she keep it up, now\r\nshe has no practice?”\r\n\r\n“They will have private theatricals down at Weston, I have no doubt.”\r\n\r\n“I beseech your ladyship’s interest to get me invited. It will be such a\r\nnew thing to see lord F—— on the stage. Of course he will play the\r\nheroes to his wife’s heroines. Whatever may have been hitherto, he will\r\nscarcely like, I should think ... he is scarcely the man.... Faith! if\r\nshe is proud and high-spirited, as you say, she has met her match.”\r\n\r\nLady Frances smiled; and as she was led away to supper, assured her\r\npartner that nothing could be pleasanter than the terms they were all on\r\nwith lady F——; for she was, after all, a noble creature; which\r\ninformation was received with a deferential bow.\r\n\r\nIn every group of talkers, lady F——’s merits were canvassed. Some ladies\r\nwould give any thing in the world for her courage, till reminded by\r\ntheir mammas that she had been trained to self-confidence, when they\r\nsuddenly became contented with their own timidity. Others would have\r\nsupposed her not out of her teens, by the girlish enjoyment she seemed\r\nto feel; but these were reminded that this kind of scene was as new to\r\nher as if she had not been seen and heard of in public for nearly four\r\nyears. Everybody agreed that she was beautiful, and very amiable, and\r\nastonishingly simple, and conducting herself with wonderful propriety:\r\nand everybody admired the good-natured earl’s manner towards her, and\r\nwondered whether it was lady Frances’s own choice to come with her, and\r\nconjectured what lord F——’s happiness must be to witness his bride’s\r\nflattering welcome to the rank he had given her.\r\n\r\nLord F——’s happiness, though as great as these kind friends could wish,\r\nwas not altogether of the character they supposed.\r\n\r\n“You have enjoyed yourself, Letitia,” he observed, as they were going\r\nhome in the grey of the morning, and when she made the first pause in\r\nher remarks to let down the glass, as a market cart, laden with early\r\nvegetables and flowers, passed for a few moments alongside the carriage.\r\n\r\n“How sweet!—O how sweet those violets are!” she exclaimed, as a whiff of\r\nfragrance was blown in. “Enjoyed myself! Yes,—it is a new page,—quite a\r\nnew page of human history to me.”\r\n\r\n“Your passion is for turning over such pages. What next?”\r\n\r\n“If I had a market-woman’s cloak and bonnet, I should like to step into\r\nthat cart and go to Covent-Garden, to see the people dressing it up\r\nagainst sunrise. I should like, some morning, to go into the city when\r\nthe sun is just touching the steeples, and see life waken up in the\r\nstreets.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder you did not stand in the door-way to-night,” said her husband,\r\nsmiling, “to see the contrast between speculating life on the pavement\r\nand polished life in the saloon.”\r\n\r\n“I saw enough, without standing in the door-way,” replied Letitia,\r\ngravely. “It was more different than I had supposed from something of\r\nthe same kind that I had seen often enough before. I had seen the great\r\nand the humble throng about our theatre doors; but then there was room\r\nfor each, though far apart. All went to share a common entertainment,—to\r\nbe happy at the same time, though not side by side. Here there were\r\npeers within and paupers without; careless luxury above, and withering\r\nhardship below. This is too deep a page for my reading, Henry; and not\r\nthe easier for my having been in both conditions myself.”\r\n\r\n“Why wish then for more experience, till you have settled this matter?”\r\n\r\n“Because we cannot tell, till we have tried, what we may find in any\r\nmatter to throw light upon any other matter.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose you should find all wrapped in darkness at last, as Faust did\r\nwhen he had gratified his passion for experience.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible,—having Faust before me for a warning. He kindled his altar\r\nfire from below when the sun was high, and he let somebody put it out\r\nwhen both sun and moon were gone down. Where was the use of his\r\nburning-glass then? How should he be otherwise than dark?”\r\n\r\n“True; but how would you manage better?”\r\n\r\n“I would never quit stability for a moment. Faust found out that the\r\nworld rolled round continually. He jumped to the conclusion that there\r\nwas no such thing in nature as a firm footing, and so cast himself off\r\ninto perdition. If he had taken his walks in God’s broad sunshine, he\r\nwould have found that the ground did not give way under him, nor ever\r\nwould, till he was etherealized enough to stand on air.”\r\n\r\n“So instead of speculating on the incompatibilities of human\r\nhappinesses, and concluding that there is no such thing as a common\r\nwelfare, you would make trial of all conditions, and deduce the summum\r\nbonum from your experience.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; that is the way; and if you would help me, the thing would be done\r\ntwice as well. If we were each to go a pilgrimage through the ranks of\r\nsociety, (for we would settle the affairs of the moral world before we\r\nbegan upon the natural,)....”\r\n\r\n“Very reasonably, certainly,” replied her husband, smiling, “since it is\r\neasier to get into palaces and hovels, than into thunder-clouds and\r\nsea-caves.”\r\n\r\n“Well;—if you began at the top and I at the bottom, if we were to meet\r\nin the middle, I do think we might see how all might dance amidst\r\nfragrance and music, and none lean starving on the frosty area-rails.\r\nYou should be king, minister, peer, and so on, down to a tradesman; and\r\nI would be a friendless Italian boy with his white mouse, and a pauper,\r\nand a cotton-spinner, and a house-servant, and so upwards, till I met\r\nyou at the tradesman’s we spoke of.”\r\n\r\n“My dear, why do you put yourself at the bottom instead of me?”\r\n\r\n“Because you would be longer in learning what to make of poverty than I.\r\nI know a good deal about it already, you are aware.”\r\n\r\n“Since we cannot rove up and down as we will through the mazes of\r\nsociety, Letitia, we will do what we can by varying our occupations.\r\nVariety of research may partly stand in the stead of migration from rank\r\nto rank.—You spoke at random, just now, of my being minister. What would\r\nyou say if I were to become a servant of the crown;—that is, in other\r\nwords, a servant of the people?”\r\n\r\n“That I would serve you,—O how humbly, how devotedly!—as the servant of\r\nthe people,” cried Letitia, colouring high. “You know....”\r\n\r\n“I know that in marrying me you dreaded, above all things, falling into\r\nthe routine of aristocratic idleness. I know that you felt it a\r\nsacrifice to surrender your public service and influence; and this is\r\none reason among many, Letitia, why I should like to accept office;—that\r\nyou might espouse another kind of public service in espousing me. But\r\nhere we are at home. I shall be able to tell you more after dinner\r\nto-morrow than I know at present of this matter.”\r\n\r\nLetitia’s experience of this day was not yet over. She found it very\r\npainful to be undressed by a yawning, winking lady’s-maid; and she\r\nresolved that her engagements should never more deprive Mrs. Philips of\r\nher natural rest, however lady Frances might teach Mrs. Philips herself\r\nto laugh at the absurdity of a lady of rank troubling herself to lay\r\naside her own trappings.\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                                PASTIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nLady F——’s “experience” might have been of a very different kind from\r\nthat which now lay in her way, if her regard to “stability” had been\r\nless. When very young,—at the period of her father’s misfortunes and\r\ndeath,—she had been strongly tempted to marry Mr. Waldie, a merchant,\r\nwho was thought by the few friends of the destitute girl to have done\r\nher great honour by offering her his hand at such a crisis, and to have\r\nproved the disinterestedness of his attachment in a way which should\r\nhave ensured it a better return. Letitia refused him, however; giving to\r\nher protectors the very sufficient reason that she did not love Mr.\r\nWaldie; and keeping to herself the further justification that she had no\r\nconfidence in the steadiness of his principles and conduct. His impulses\r\nwere generous, but fitful; and there was an excitement about him which\r\nhad never yet been absorbed by any pursuit, or allayed by any\r\npossession. This might take any turn as he grew older,—either benevolent\r\nor selfish. It might be philanthropy,—but it might also be wine,\r\nbilliards, roving, or many other things which would involve the slavery\r\nof his wife;—and Letitia, unblinded by passion, was able to perceive\r\nthat there is little enough of rational freedom at the best in the\r\ncondition of a wife, and that a woman’s only hope of that which the\r\nmarriage law at present denies her rests in the steady principle as well\r\nas the enlightened views of her husband. Her friends soon after\r\nexclaimed against Mr. Waldie’s fickleness in a case which did not, in\r\nher opinion, testify fickleness of affection so much as rashness of\r\nconduct. He offered (as soon as he found his cause hopeless with\r\nLetitia) to her elder sister; and Maria, being really, and having been\r\nlong, attached to him, married him, not unwarned by her sister of the\r\ntendency of his failings. The tenderest affection henceforth subsisted\r\nbetween the sisters. Maria was full of gratitude to Letitia for having\r\nrefused Mr. Waldie; and Letitia was full of respectful compassion for\r\nMaria when she witnessed her devotion to her husband, and could not\r\nstifle the conviction that that husband’s first affection had not died\r\nout the more rapidly for being too suddenly repressed. Maria was\r\nsatisfied that she had as much of Mr. Waldie’s affection as he would\r\never have to bestow on one permanent object; and that she was much\r\nhappier than she could ever have been without him; so that she called\r\nherself, and all who spoke on the matter called her, a very fortunate\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nMr. Waldie had begun life as a rich man. His business was almost as\r\nconsiderable as any in the city; his abode on the Surrey side of London\r\nwas elegant, and beautifully situated, and he kept two carriages. The\r\nwonder had been, during all the four years of Letitia’s professional\r\ncareer, why so rich a brother-in-law should have allowed her to live by\r\nany such means. Mr. Waldie incessantly and truly pleaded that he could\r\nnot help it; and much was said of her unconquerable love of the fine\r\narts, and of the eccentricities into which her passion for independence\r\nled her. The sisters knew of very good reasons besides these why Letitia\r\nshould not submit to live on the bounty of a brother-in-law, even if he\r\nwere as generous as Mr. Waldie; and when the matter ended in Letitia\r\nbecoming lady F——, her eccentricities met with all due respect.\r\n\r\nLady Frances never could conceive why Letitia called her present life an\r\nidle one, and seemed to think entertaining her sister’s children the\r\nmost serious business she had. Lady Frances thought no life so busy as\r\nthat of persons of rank during the season. For her part, she saw\r\ntradespeople loiter about much more than she had time to do. Did not the\r\nbaker’s man stop for a few minutes’ talk with the kitchen-girl in the\r\narea? Were not fishmongers seen leaning with folded arms against their\r\nstalls? Did not shopmen read newspapers behind the counter, and\r\nmerchants’ clerks stop in the Strand to look at caricatures? All this\r\nwhile, ladies of her rank never could get through all the shopping they\r\nplanned for a morning, unless they gave up one or two of the\r\nexhibitions; and nobody ever went down Regent-street in such a hurry as\r\nlord B. or the duke of C.; unless it was the newsman or letter-carrier.\r\nShe, for one, had been intending for weeks to call on poor old lady Y.,\r\nand had never found time; while Letitia, who had such superior tastes\r\ntoo, complained (if you asked her) that she had not enough to do. With\r\nher books, and her harp, and her singing,—she was very careful to keep\r\nup her singing,—with all these in addition to her “social duties,” so\r\nengrossing during the season, one would have thought she had had enough\r\non her hands; but she had asked her husband to read German with her; and\r\nthey actually sat down, like school children, with a dictionary between\r\nthem, every morning before his lordship went out. Moreover, she was\r\npolishing up her little French girl,—perhaps for a governess for her\r\nsister’s children. Very sweet children those were; and it was natural\r\nthat Letitia should love them, as being her sister’s; but it seemed\r\nreally to be giving up too much to them to refuse a sweet spring ride to\r\nHampton Court, because she had promised to take the little things into\r\nthe park with her, that particular day. The worst of it was, Letitia was\r\ninfecting her husband with this notion of not having enough to do.\r\nHe....\r\n\r\n“You will hear no more of that,” quietly observed the earl. “Henry will\r\nhave quite enough on his hands henceforward. He has accepted office.”\r\n\r\n“Poor Letitia!” exclaimed lady Frances, laughing. “She will have more\r\ntime hanging heavy than ever, unless, indeed, Henry makes her his\r\nprivate secretary.”\r\n\r\n“He might do worse,” observed the earl. “And, proud as you think Henry,\r\nhe will not disdain to let his wife cast many lights into the affairs he\r\nis taking in hand. If he knows most of the theory and practice of trade,\r\nshe has had the most to do with individual and social character.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, sir, as she had to make human nature a professional study.\r\nWhen Henry has to do with bonds and liabilities, she can enact Portia;\r\nwhen he studies insurance, she will find something à propos in the\r\nTempest; and she must have many a fine smuggling scene at her tongue’s\r\nend.”\r\n\r\n“True. It is a happy thing for a man of business, as Henry will find, to\r\nhave an accomplished wife to lighten and recompense his toil.”\r\n\r\nThis was one of the many thoughts in lord F——’s mind when he sought\r\nLetitia to tell her that the negociation was concluded, and that he was\r\nto take office immediately. He found her and Thérèse in the music-room,\r\nbusy with the three little Waldies. The youngest was sitting on the\r\ntable, clutching aunt Letitia’s curls, while she was explaining to the\r\neldest what Bewick’s old man was doing in the churchyard. The second\r\nkneeled on Thérèse’s lap, babbling French, of which she knew about as\r\nmuch as of English. A charming discord of sweet sounds greeted lord\r\nF——’s ears as he entered the room. The “Da, da, da,” of the baby; the\r\ncoqueting in French about a kiss between Thérèse and her charge; and the\r\nanxious questions and explanations of the two engaged upon Bewick, made\r\nthe uncle prefer looking on in silence, till Letitia turned to him with,\r\n\r\n“It will not do. We must give it up at present. There is no making\r\nlittle children understand about old age, and death, and churchyards.”\r\n\r\nThe child turned her frowning face upon her uncle, as if appealing to\r\nhim for light. He could not but try. He found she had seen Brixton\r\nchurch, seen something there this very morning; whether a wedding or a\r\nfuneral, it required some time to find out; and this involved a\r\ndescription of each. Then came the question,\r\n\r\n“Why are people white when they are married, and black when they are\r\nburied?”\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the explanation, she turned to the picture,\r\n\r\n“Is that little boy with his hoop going to be buried? Is that old man\r\ngoing to be buried?”\r\n\r\nNo: they were neither of them dead yet; but the old man would be before\r\nvery long, for he was very, very old....\r\n\r\n“Then, was he rather new once?”\r\n\r\nUncle could no longer keep so grave as the subject required, and\r\nbesides, did not know how to convey that old and new would not do in all\r\ncases so well as old and young. He too gave up.\r\n\r\n“Shall we ride?” asked Letitia, as lord F—— looked at his watch. “I can\r\nsend Thérèse home with the children.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose we take them ourselves. This may be the last morning for some\r\ntime that I shall be able to devote to you and yours.”\r\n\r\n“It may be the last time we shall see Maria for some weeks,” replied\r\nLetitia. “I am glad you can go.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were seated in the carriage, lady F—— explained that\r\nWaldie was so much out of spirits, and looked so wretchedly ill, that\r\nhis wife was bent on getting him from home. She was sure he must have\r\noverworked himself at business, and he did not attempt to account for\r\nhis depression in any other way.\r\n\r\n“You had better take them down to Weston with you,” said lord F——. “It\r\nwill be a comfort to you to have your sister with you till I can join\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“None whatever,” said Letitia, smiling. “While you are a man of\r\nbusiness, I will not be a woman of pleasure. I will stay in town till\r\nyou can introduce Weston and me to each other.”\r\n\r\nAnd Letitia would hear nothing about the heat, the emptiness of the\r\ntown, the solitude to which she would be doomed while her husband was\r\nbeing initiated into his office. In town she would stay while her\r\nhusband remained; and so it was settled, as this happened not to be one\r\nof the points which his lordship had fixed unalterably within himself.\r\n\r\n“There is papa!” exclaimed the eldest child, quitting her stand at the\r\ncarriage window, and clinging to her aunt’s neck, as soon as they\r\nentered the sweep which led up to Mr. Waldie’s door.\r\n\r\n“Yes; it is your papa. I wonder what brings him home so long before\r\ndinner to-day.”\r\n\r\nWaldie had been standing with his hands in his pockets, gazing on\r\nvacancy, till the sound of the carriage wheels roused him. When he saw\r\nwho was come, he appeared suddenly busy among his shrubs, and turned his\r\nback towards the house door.—Maria appeared, with a smile; but there was\r\ndiscomposure under it.\r\n\r\n“Go and tell papa, my dear. He did not see the carriage. Go and ask him\r\nto come in.”\r\n\r\nBut the child for once was slow to obey. She clung closer to her mamma\r\nthe more she was bid to go.\r\n\r\n“We will go together,” said Letitia, leading the way to where Waldie was\r\nhalf buried among the shrubs. When he could no longer pretend not to see\r\nthem, he came forward and shook hands; but his countenance was black as\r\nnight. His anxious wife busied herself in pointing out how grievously\r\nthe Portugal laurels were blighted.\r\n\r\n“Blighted! aye, look! Not a leaf that does not crumble like ashes in my\r\nhand,” said Waldie, twitching off a spray and crumbling the leaves. “I\r\nhad set my heart upon these laurels, and now to see them ruined in this\r\nway.... Damn the blight!” muttered he between his teeth.\r\n\r\n“I hear there is much mischief done in Kent,” observed lord F——.\r\n\r\n“In Kent! You would think there had been a shower of Gomorrah rain by\r\nthe look of the place. Young ash plantations, miles long, with their\r\nshoots crisped and black, worse than my laurels. Curse the blight!”\r\n\r\n“And the hops....” lord F—— was going on to inquire; but Mrs. Waldie\r\nheld up her finger to stop him. He broke off suddenly, and Waldie turned\r\nround upon his wife with a look which made her change colour. In order\r\nto relieve everybody, lord F—— summoned up all his experiences of the\r\nmischiefs done by blight at Weston, diverging gradually upon topics\r\nnearly related,—modes of improving, embellishing, &c., and ending with\r\nan invitation to the Waldies to go down and occupy the place for the few\r\nweeks of its greatest beauty. Waldie glanced quickly from one to\r\nanother, as if suspicious of some plot to humour and amuse him, and then\r\nbluntly intimated that his going from home at present was out of the\r\nquestion. Scarcely another word could be got out of him, even when the\r\nladies had walked away into the greenhouse, and the children had tried\r\nwho could run fastest from papa, leaving him alone with lord F——.\r\n\r\n“Do not you think him looking very ill,—very much altered?” inquired\r\nMaria of her sister, with a quivering lip.\r\n\r\n“Very unlike himself to-day, certainly. Something has discomposed him.\r\nBut you must not fancy him more ill than he is. No man varies more from\r\nhour to hour, you know. He may be quite a different man to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nMaria shook her head, and then asked Letitia to observe what they came\r\nto see, without delay. She should not like her husband to think they\r\nwere consulting about his looks. Letitia snatched up the plant in\r\nquestion, and carried it to lord F—— to ask whether there were any of\r\nthe kind in the Weston greenhouses.\r\n\r\n“You had better take it with you,” said Waldie. “It requires a\r\ngreenhouse, and we shall have no greenhouses when we remove.”\r\n\r\n“Remove!” said his wife faintly.\r\n\r\n“Remove! yes, my dear. You would not stay here, would you? The blights\r\nruin everything I set my heart upon; and you know I cannot bear to see a\r\nhouse so exposed as ours, with not a tree to cast a particle of shade on\r\nany part of it. There is Erpingham’s house, down below, with those fine\r\nspreading sycamores beside it ... that is something like a house. We\r\ncould live there for a lifetime, and never grow tired of it. But you see\r\nit will take a lifetime for our clumps to grow roof-high. I shall move\r\ninto the city.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless we shall find you still here, five years hence,” said lord\r\nF——, smiling. “When the blights are over, you will love this pretty\r\nplace too well to leave it.”\r\n\r\n“Curse the blights!” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“You have not been in town to-day, Waldie?” said lord F——. “Then you\r\nhave probably not heard that I have taken office....”\r\n\r\n“At the Board of Trade?—Well! I suppose one ought to be glad of it,—I\r\nsuppose you expect to be congratulated; but, upon my soul, I do not know\r\nhow to feel upon it. There is such a curse clinging to trade. People\r\ntalk of the honour and glory of being a British merchant, and of\r\nlegislating for British merchants. I wish both you and I, my lord, may\r\nnot find more plague than profit in it.”\r\n\r\n“I know I am about to encounter much perplexity, Waldie—perhaps some\r\nabuse, and certainly, much painful knowledge about the distresses of the\r\ncountry. Nevertheless, I have accepted office—or I should rather say, we\r\nhave taken office; for Letitia remains in town as long as business\r\ndetains me here.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad you allow wives to be official too,” said Letitia, smiling.\r\n“Come plague, come profit, brother, it is hardly fair that they should\r\nhave double the one and only half the other; which is the case when they\r\nare shut out from that department of their husbands’ concerns.”\r\n\r\n“‘Double, double toil and trouble’....” said lord F——.\r\n\r\n“And watchfulness, and struggle, and woe,” continued Letitia, “when they\r\nfeel they could solace and help, and are not allowed. When I find I can\r\ndo neither, I will go down to Weston without another word.”\r\n\r\n“My dear,” said Waldie, “would you like to take the children down to\r\nWeston? I must stay in town, but....”\r\n\r\n“O, indeed, we want no change. Unless you ... you....”\r\n\r\n“Then we will remain at home this summer, lord F——, thank you. Our wives\r\nboth prefer it, I see.”\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Waldie put some cheerfulness into his manner as he handed lady\r\nF—— into the carriage. At the first opening in the trees, Letitia saw\r\nhim draw his wife’s arm within his own, and walk with her towards the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n“It cannot be the blight that has soured him so,” observed lady F—— to\r\nher husband. “That must be a mere pretence.”\r\n\r\n“Blights destroy other things besides Portugal laurels,” replied her\r\nhusband. “Did not you see how I was forbidden to enlarge upon hops?”\r\n\r\n“What can he have to do with hops? O! I begin to see. Speculation is to\r\nbe his ruin,—not wine, or gaming.”\r\n\r\n“Must he be ruined?” enquired lord F——.\r\n\r\n“Yes. There is wide ruin in success, where it comes from speculation.\r\nRuin of peace.—Who would possess paradise, if it were on an island which\r\nmight be sunk in the sea at any moment? O! poor Maria!”\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                              DISCUSSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek after week the steward sent reports from Weston of the beauty of\r\nthe place, and the high order it was kept in for its lady’s approval,\r\nand the impatience of the tenants and the villagers for my lord and\r\nlady’s arrival. Week after week did friends and acquaintance leave town,\r\ntill it became what the inhabitants of Westminster call a desert, though\r\nit would still puzzle a child to perceive the resemblance between it and\r\nthe solitary places where lions await the lonely wayfarer. Week by week\r\ndid Mrs. Philips expatiate on the delights of watering-places, and the\r\ncharms of the country, and the intolerableness of town in the\r\nsummer,—and still neither master nor mistress seemed to dream of\r\nstirring. “A few weeks in the autumn! Was that all the change they were\r\nto have? And how were they to exist till the autumn, she should like to\r\nknow?” Lady F—— was so far from wishing that Philips should not exist,\r\nthat on learning her discontents, she took immediate measures for\r\nforwarding her to her dear lady Frances, more than half of whose\r\npleasure at Brighton had been spoiled by her having no one to manage her\r\ntoilet on whose taste she could rely as a corroboration of her own. The\r\nday which saw Philips deposited in a Brighton coach brought ease not\r\nonly to herself, but to those who lost, and her who gained her. Philips\r\nwas certainly right. Her talents were not appreciated in her new home;\r\nand she would indeed never be able to make anything of her new lady.\r\nLike other persons of genius, mere kindness was not enough for Philips;\r\nshe pined for sympathy, congeniality, and applause, for which London\r\naffords no scope in the summer season.\r\n\r\nHow Thérèse sang as she watered her lady’s plants, that day! How many\r\nconfessions had she to pour forth to her old priest of feelings in which\r\nhe traced incipient envy and jealousy, but in which she acknowledged\r\nonly fear and dislike! How long a letter did she write to her father to\r\ninform him of her promotion to Mrs. Philips’s place, and consequent\r\nincrease of salary;—of her intention to take a few lessons in\r\nhair-dressing, now that she could afford it, and felt it to be due to\r\nher mistress; and how happy she should be, when this duty to madame was\r\nprovided for, to send money enough to put Annette to school, and perhaps\r\neven to place a new hot-bed at her father’s disposal!—How charming a\r\nvariety was made in the household by a passing visit from the earl! And\r\nhow pleased he looked when, on popping his head in at the library-door,\r\nlate one evening, he found Letitia acting as secretary to her husband,\r\nlooking over books, making notes, and preparing materials for a reply to\r\na deputation which was to wait on him the next morning.\r\n\r\n“I hope you like hard work as well as you thought you should,” said he,\r\nlaughing. “Have you begun to think yet of petitioning for a more equal\r\ndivision of it,—for a multiplication of places?”\r\n\r\n“Heaven forbid!” exclaimed Letitia. “A multiplication of places now,\r\nwhen there is such an outcry against places and placemen! It would be as\r\nmuch as our lives are worth.”\r\n\r\n“And, what is more to the purpose,” said lord F——, “it is unnecessary.\r\nIt matters little that it is the fashion to mix up in ignorant minds the\r\nodium of holding a sinecure, and the honour of filling a laborious\r\noffice;—it matters little that all the people have not yet learned to\r\ndistinguish the caterpillars from the silk-worms of the state; for they\r\nwill soon learn to hold the servants of the nation in due honour.\r\nMeanwhile, all that we want is a more equal distribution of the toils of\r\ngovernment.”\r\n\r\n“All that we want, son! It is much to want. What an absurdity it seems\r\nthat a nobleman should, from having merely his private affairs to\r\nmanage, be suddenly burdened with the responsibilities of an empire;—a\r\nburden, under which how many have been crushed! Again, there is your old\r\nschool-fellow, lord H——, yawning half the day on the pier at Brighton,\r\nand airing his horses the other half, while you are sitting here, pen in\r\nhand, from morning till night.”\r\n\r\n“I have no objection to it, sir. It has been a serious grievance to me,\r\never since I returned from my travels, that I had nothing better to do\r\nthan what I have been doing.”\r\n\r\n“Studying, growing accomplished, falling in love, and marrying,” replied\r\nthe earl, laughing. “What would you have been doing more?”\r\n\r\n“As it happens, sir, all this proves an excellent preparation for my\r\npresent business. But I did not know that it would; and I was\r\nperpetually asking myself,—moreover, Letitia was perpetually asking\r\nme,—the end and aim of my employments.”\r\n\r\n“That was the secret, I dare say,” said the earl, “of your difficulty in\r\nwinning her. Eh, Letitia?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed it was,” replied Letitia, blushing. “God knows what difficulty I\r\nfound in making it a difficulty; but I dared not at once give up the\r\ncalling which nature had sanctified to me, without providing for my race\r\nbeing served in an equal proportion in some other way. If there be one\r\nnote sooner than another to which conscience awakes in these times, it\r\nis to the cry of unserved humanity; and mine, having been once thus\r\nawakened, could not be lulled asleep again; and even your son could not\r\nsoothe it till he began to promise that we should labour together for\r\nall, as well as for each other.”\r\n\r\n“So you married to be useful;—for no other reason on earth, my dear?”\r\n\r\n“No, no, no. I was useful before. I married ... for the same reason as\r\nyour son. But this reason did not make me forget my responsibilities;\r\nthat is all.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, my dear: you do not know,—highly as you rate your art,—what you\r\nhave deprived society of by shutting yourself up here. Why,—I saw that\r\nsot, colonel Bibber, turned into a patriot for full three hours under\r\nyour influence; and poor little lord H. that we were speaking of just\r\nnow, grew almost magnanimous for the same space of time. These, and\r\nhundreds more, owe to you, my dear, the greater part of whatever virtue\r\nhas visited them for the last five years.”\r\n\r\n“If so,” said lord F——, “what was the effect on better people?”\r\n\r\n“The effect that the fine arts are ordained to produce,” said Letitia.\r\n“They have much to answer for who defame them,—who perceive nothing in\r\nthem besides colours, and sounds, and motion,—who put a kaleidoscope and\r\nRaphael’s Transfiguration on a level, and recognize nothing more in a\r\nsymphony of Mozart than in an Eolian harp, and see no matter of choice\r\nbetween a merry Andrew and Kean in Hamlet. They who perceive not that\r\nthe fine arts are the fittest embodiments of truth and beauty are\r\nunconscious of the vastness of the department in which they would have\r\nman remain unserved. Such would wonder or laugh at my view of my\r\nprofession, and discredit my hesitating to leave it for lord F——.”\r\n\r\n“You were satisfied that you held a commission to serve man, by means of\r\nthe fine arts; you were right, my dear, as is proved by your having made\r\nthe colonel a patriot, and the little lord a hero.”\r\n\r\n“That it was only for three hours at a time,” said Letitia, “was not my\r\nfault, but that of the arrangements by which means and ends are\r\nsometimes separated as far asunder as if the world would be perilled by\r\ntheir coming together. In this, we might wisely copy from man in his\r\nstate of nature. Indian savages have their songs and dances immediately\r\nbefore their battles; and, as long as prayers imply devotion, they are\r\neverywhere used in senates as a prelude to the business of the nation.\r\nBut we go straight from an oratorio to dinner, from a tragedy to sleep,\r\nfrom the Elgin marbles to shopping in Regent-street; while, on the other\r\nhand, if a great national question has to be debated, a mighty national\r\nachievement to be wrought, the last thing its conductors would think of\r\nwould be to spiritualise the passions, and elevate the emotions, and\r\nanimate the faculties by the most appropriate means which Providence has\r\ngiven for that end.—I know that this union can be only partially\r\neffected yet. I know that the passage of the Reform Bill would have been\r\nbut little helped by any such appliances as we can at present exhibit;\r\nbut it will be different hereafter, when men have learned the true\r\noffice of the fine arts, and the ultimate objects of political reforms.\r\nThen, hundreds of years hence, it may be,—if a new question of national\r\nrenovation should be brought forward, the senate to whom it is committed\r\nmay lay hold, with one accord, on whatever prior observance may best\r\nsoothe down their animosities, and banish their petty self-regards, and\r\nestablish their minds in that state of lofty tranquillity which alone\r\nbeseems the master-spirits of an empire.”\r\n\r\n“In those days,” said lord F——, “there will be an end of the absurdity\r\nof admitting the ennobling influence of the fine arts, and at the same\r\ntime holding its professors in contempt.”\r\n\r\n“Is it, even now, anything more than a nominal contempt?” asked Letitia.\r\n“Do not people mix up the profession and the vices of its professors\r\ntogether, and then talk of contempt?”\r\n\r\n“But those very vices are caused by the treatment of the profession.”\r\n\r\n“True; like all other professional vices,—like all the peculiar failings\r\nof certain classes,—like the avarice of Jews, the romancing of\r\ntravellers, the spiritual pride of sectaries, the vanity of authors.\r\nWhen prejudices are so far surmounted as that no class shall be regarded\r\nwith factitious deference or contempt, there will be an end of all\r\noccasion to reproach painters, musicians and actors with their tendency\r\nto self-indulgence, at the same time that proverbs and by-words against\r\nJews, methodists, travellers, and poets, will fall into oblivion.”\r\n\r\n“In those days,” said lord F——, “perhaps our peerage may honour itself\r\nby taking up the profession of the fine arts. The time is coming when no\r\nclass of society may be idle; and if the aristocracy plumes itself upon\r\nits refinement, this seems to be the pursuit most congenial to its\r\nconstitution.”\r\n\r\n“If you preach your doctrine,—that all must work,—to those of your own\r\ncondition,” said the earl, “they will ask you where you got the\r\nnotion,—whether you are intimidated by the clamours of the lower\r\nclasses.”\r\n\r\n“Not intimidated by their clamours, but moved by their condition, I\r\nwould tell them, sir; and that I derive my notion from the nature of man\r\nand of society, and not from the dictation of any class whatever. It is\r\nenough to melt a heart of stone to read and hear of such distresses as\r\nhave come to my knowledge since I entered office; but I am convinced\r\nthat many of the sufferers look in the wrong direction for the causes.”\r\n\r\n“Yet there must be much cause for complaint,” said Letitia, “when our\r\ninstitutions lead to such an opposition of interests as there now is\r\nbetween different ranks. They should surely work together....”\r\n\r\n“The present opposition of interests, my dear, arises from a scarcity of\r\nthe prime necessaries of life. If there were food enough for our people,\r\ntheir occupations and interests, be they as various as the minds that\r\nadopt them, would assist and promote each other from end to end of\r\nsociety. If there be a scarcity of food, men will snatch from one\r\nanother’s mouths, be they huddled together in our manufacturing cities,\r\nor duly distributed in a Moravian settlement. Where there is plenty,\r\nthere will be a harmony,—where there is want, there will be an\r\nopposition of interests; and it is folly to assign co-operation and\r\ncompetition as the remedy and cause of distress.”\r\n\r\n“Nay; but can it be right that starving thousands should bid their\r\nlabour against one another for bread? Can it be right that whole\r\nfamilies should, at this moment, be crouching down supperless in their\r\nlitter of straw, while we.... O, I am ashamed of our luxuries!... our\r\nmirrors, and harps, and lamps,—and my very dress. I am ashamed of them\r\nall.”\r\n\r\n“If we gave them all away this moment, my dear, they would not be food;\r\nand if exchanged for bread, they would only take food from the mouths of\r\nsome who want it, to give to those who cannot want it more. Believe me,\r\nthe inequality of condition we are complaining of is rather checked than\r\npromoted by competition. Competition equalizes the profits of industry,\r\nand increases instead of lessening its productiveness.”\r\n\r\n“Whence, then, comes all this misery? all this tremendous inequality?”\r\n\r\n“The misery arises from a deficiency of food....”\r\n\r\n“Well; whence this deficiency of food?”\r\n\r\n“From the tendency of eaters to increase faster than the supply of\r\nfood.”\r\n\r\n“But if we can raise more food by co-operation than without it....”\r\n\r\n“Even supposing we could,—unless co-operation also checked the increase\r\nof numbers, it could prove no more than a temporary alleviation of our\r\ngrievances. In my opinion, it would, if it included equality of\r\ncondition, leave us in a worse state than it found us, in as far as it\r\nwould relax the springs of enterprise and industry, and, in time, bring\r\nthe community down into a deplorable state of sameness; it would, if\r\npersevered in, make us into a nation of half-naked potatoe eaters, and\r\nwater-drinkers.”\r\n\r\nThe earl inquired whether anything had been heard lately of the\r\nco-operative society formed in the neighbourhood of Weston.\r\n\r\n“O yes!” replied lord F——. “They are enjoying the benefits of\r\ncompetition to the utmost. They ascribe their prosperity to their\r\nco-operation; but they are, in fact, a large partnership in competition\r\nwith smaller ones. They do not see how their relative position would be\r\naltered by their absorbing all their competitors into their firm, with\r\nno check to their numbers, while nature has imposed perpetual checks\r\nupon the growth of their capital.”\r\n\r\n“But cannot numbers be checked,—cannot the checks upon the growth of\r\ncapital be evaded, while we have such a wide world to move about in?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, my dear: but there is no need of equality of condition to\r\nhelp us to do this. Competition is more likely than co-operation to\r\ninduce prudence and foresight; and it will quicken our activity in\r\ncarrying our surplus numbers to distant fertile lands, or in bringing\r\nthe produce of distant fertile lands among our own people, instead of\r\ntempting us to waste more and more of our capital continually in turning\r\nup inferior lands at home, as the co-operatives would have us do.”\r\n\r\n“But were not you telling me that your rent-roll becomes more valuable\r\nas time passes? Are not landholders’ incomes increasing perpetually\r\nunder the present system?”\r\n\r\n“They are; but this is the consequence, not of competition, but of the\r\nvarying qualities of the land, the tillage of every new grade of which\r\ntends to lower profits and raise rents. No plan for the distribution of\r\nhome produce can affect the law by which the returns to capital are\r\nperpetually diminished.”\r\n\r\n“But what will be the end of it under the present system?”\r\n\r\n“There are two extremes to which the systems of equality and inequality\r\nof distribution respectively tend, in as far as they involve restriction\r\nupon food by using only the produce of our own lands. Under the equality\r\nsystem, there would be an ultimate scramble for potatoes, or a worse\r\ndiet still, if there were such a thing. Under our present system, the\r\nwhole produce must in time be in the hands of the land-owners and\r\ntax-takers. Of course, we must change our system; not, however, by\r\ndiscouraging competition, or abolishing private property, but by\r\nremoving all artificial restrictions upon food, and by regulating our\r\nnumbers according to our resources. The way to bring down landlords’\r\nrents, and to increase the profits of cultivators, is to procure food\r\nfrom some better source than our own inferior lands; and this I will\r\nprove to you by figures, the next time my steward brings me the accounts\r\nof my farms.”\r\n\r\n“O, that Moravian village!” exclaimed Letitia. “How often I think of the\r\nday we spent there! There was comfort, there was abundance, there was\r\nmutual assistance and agreement.”\r\n\r\n“Are you quite sure, Letitia, that there was nothing in the situation\r\nand peculiarities of the place which called off your attention from the\r\nprinciple on which the society was constituted? Remember the sunset,\r\nthat evening; the golden light on the green hill side, above the rows of\r\nMoravian dwellings. Remember your admiration of the internal\r\nregulations,—of the women’s uniform, of the music in their church, of\r\nthe simplicity of their way of life. Remember that all this has nothing\r\nto do with their principle of association.”\r\n\r\n“You must no more set the accomplishments of the Moravians to the\r\naccount of community of goods, than the absurdities of the Shakers,”\r\nobserved the earl. “That some sing beautifully, and others dance\r\nridiculously, has nothing to do with the distribution of their wealth.”\r\n\r\n“No more than the ordinances of the Harmonites,” continued lord F——.\r\n“Mr. Owen’s followers very properly refuse to be mixed up with\r\nMoravians, Shakers, and Harmonites. Superstition has no part in their\r\nsystem, either under the form of ritual observance or celibacy. Yet they\r\nare apt to incorporate extraneous matters with their system, which serve\r\nas allurements to a greater extent, I doubt not, than they intend. They\r\nowe more converts than they suppose to their promises of mansions,\r\npleasure-grounds, coffee, alabaster lamps, and so on. My wonder is that\r\nmore are not enticed by descriptions like these, accompanied with\r\npromises of ease, and leisure, and many other things to be obtained in a\r\nshort time, which the poor man now sees little chance of his children’s\r\nchildren ever enjoying.”\r\n\r\n“There might be alabaster lamps and damask furniture in every house\r\nunder the present system,” observed the earl, “if food enough could be\r\ngot to keep the production of capital going at its natural rate; aye,\r\nand ease and leisure too, if our numbers were kept within bounds. It is\r\nnot so very long since shoes and stockings were worn only in courts; and\r\nthat they are now worn by peasants proves that our capital has grown\r\nunder a system of competition. That multitudes have little ease and no\r\nleisure is the fault of over-population, which would be rather\r\naggravated than lessened under a system whose very essence it is to cast\r\neach man’s burdens upon all. No man need scruple to have twenty of his\r\nchildren gracing the dinner-table of a co-operative establishment, till\r\nhe should find, too late, that not all the savings caused by extensive\r\nassociation can compensate for the falling off in the produce of\r\ninferior lands, and for the new impulse given to population. His sons\r\nand his sons’ sons must add more and more labour to the common stock;\r\nmust give up, first, damask and alabaster, then broadcloth and glass;\r\nthen descend to sackcloth and wooden trenchers, then to tatters,\r\npotatoes and water, and then....”\r\n\r\n“Then would ensue a scramble; if anything should be left, competition\r\nwould come into play again; society would rise by its means, and might\r\npossibly attain once more to a state in which they might speculate on\r\nthe universality of damask and alabaster.”\r\n\r\n“Well!” exclaimed Letitia, “I shall ask to look at your steward’s\r\naccounts, and to have an explanation of them; for I do not at all like\r\nour present position. We must reach the extreme, you say, of having our\r\nwhole produce in the hands of land-owners and tax-takers, unless we\r\nchange our system.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear: but by change of system, I do not mean convulsion. All\r\nmight be set on a safe footing by timely care, the removal of\r\nrestrictions, the diffusion of intelligence. There is nothing in all\r\nthis, threatening to public dignity or private safety. There is nothing\r\nto lessen the security of property, or to endanger the rights of any\r\nclass; but quite the contrary: for property is never so secure as when\r\nit most abounds; and rights are never so well respected as in the\r\nabsence of temptation to infringe upon them.”\r\n\r\n“By change, then, you mean progression, without fear of subversion.”\r\n\r\n“Just so; the progression of society from an advanced into a higher\r\nstate. What is there in such progression that is not as beautiful in\r\ntheory as it is found to be necessary in practice?”\r\n\r\nFrom this hour, the progression of society, of which Letitia had long\r\ndreamed, on which she had often speculated, began to assume distinctness\r\nin her mind, and to form a large part of her conversation when she\r\nhappened to be with those to whom she could speak most of what was most\r\nin her thoughts. Whenever she heard of misery and crime on a large\r\nscale, she satisfied herself that the national demand of progression had\r\nnot yet been sufficiently attended to. When she heard that her lord’s\r\nrents ought to be more, but were, from the difficulty of collecting\r\nthem, less than formerly, she sighed for the time when an unrestricted\r\nprovision of food (unrestricted by state-laws) should check the rise of\r\nrents. Whenever she sat down by her husband’s side to hear curious tales\r\nof the doings of large speculators or eminent merchants, or of the\r\nsufferings of large classes of agricultural or manufacturing labourers,\r\nshe learned something that made her wonder and lament, that, while the\r\nnatural laws of production and distribution work out evenly their\r\nbalance of results, the tendency of legislation thus far seems to be to\r\nclog and thwart them, and delay the progression in intelligence and\r\ncomfort which must arise out of their unobstructed operation. She saw\r\nthat, if the universal interest of society was allowed to be the moving\r\nspring of the social economy, all would be served; and that if many yet\r\nremain unserved, it is on account of other movements being made to\r\ninterfere with it—the petty springs of narrow and mistaken interests; so\r\nthat partial protection brings on general hardship, and arbitrary\r\nstimulus, a condition of general suffering.\r\n\r\nBefore going down to Weston, Letitia had become prepared to make her way\r\nwith the steward, the co-operating workmen in the village, and all who\r\ncould throw light on the past and present state of property in the\r\nplace. Many a conversation and calculation had she also gone through\r\nwith Thérèse on the subject of shop-keeping in Paris; and all that Maria\r\ntold of Waldie’s business went to the same account of information. It\r\nmade poor Maria smile sometimes in the midst of a fit of anxiety to find\r\nthat her children’s babble savoured of political economy, when they had\r\nbeen spending a morning with their aunt. They were more ready then than\r\nat other times to wonder why they had dolls in the nursery, and\r\npicture-books in the parlour, and a shell-grotto in the garden, when\r\nmany other little children had no playthings; and why poor Ned who swept\r\nthe crossing was so much more ragged than their errand boy, when Ned\r\nworked the hardest of the two, and was often out in the cold and the\r\nrain besides. Almost babies as they were, they could sometimes find out\r\nvery sage little reasons for these things, when put on the right scent\r\nby aunt Letitia or her pupil Thérèse.\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                             MORE NOVELTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt length came September, with its utter dulness in town, and its busy\r\nbrightness in the country. No parliament, no ministry, no court, with\r\nwhose proceedings to diversify the daily papers; but instead, a\r\nreporting of the progress of certain noble lords and patriotic gentlemen\r\nfrom one country seat to another, with accurate calculations of the\r\nquantity of game bagged by each. Now were expresses hurrying to and fro\r\nin search of the runaway men in power. Now were ancient ladies proudly\r\nleaning on the arms of sons, who were happy in being allowed breathing\r\ntime to watch the autumn sunsets from the terraces of their stately\r\ncastles. Now were the young heirs of rank and wealth initiated by\r\nplayful papas into the mysteries of riding and sham shooting. Many a\r\nlittle lord was now mounted on his pony to adventure forth as far as the\r\npark gates, while mamma and sisters waved their handkerchiefs from afar,\r\nand careful grooms waited to lead him back safe. Many such a little\r\nrogue carried his mimic fowling-piece into the stubble, and learned not\r\nto wink or flinch when papa brought down a bird, or coaxed the\r\ngamekeeper to lend him a brace or two to carry when they should come in\r\nsight of home and the girls. Many a tenant now put himself in the way of\r\na greeting from his landlord, resting on a stile, or pacing his way\r\nslowly through a field. Many a state secret, that the public would fain\r\nhave known, was dismissed for some such freak as snatching at a high\r\nhazel twig, or leaping a gate. Many a fair family group of riders was\r\nseen threading green lanes, or cantering over downs, or appearing and\r\ndisappearing in the clumpy drives of a park,—graceful boys, and\r\nhigh-born girls, leading their father in search of some new beauty which\r\nit turns out he discovered in like manner, when he was a pleasure-loving\r\nyouth instead of a statesman. Now, in the golden noon, was the boat seen\r\nto unfurl its snowy sail, and glide in rivalship of grace with the swans\r\nwhich diverged on either hand to let the vessel have its way without\r\ndisturbing their serenity. He who has guided, or may guide, the helm of\r\nthe state, now condescends to steer a less majestic bark on a calmer\r\nelement; and instead of the prayers, threats and blessings of an empire,\r\nbends his ear to the prattle of his little ones, or to the rustling of a\r\nstartled deer, bounding from the thicket as the vessel nears the shore.\r\nNot now too busy to observe whether rain or sunshine be without, the\r\nrecreated statesman finds in either case equal pleasure and repose. His\r\nlady’s nursery and boudoir, his sons’ classics, his daughters’ music,\r\nhis library, his billiard table, and withal some peculiar and long\r\nrelinquished pet pursuit, give him as much pleasure on a rainy day, as\r\nthe flower-garden, the fish-pond and poultry-yard when the sky is blue\r\noverhead. He sighs over his past toils, reminds his spouse of their\r\nwedding sojourn at Chamouni, and at intervals quotes Virgil to the lad\r\nbehind his chair, and whispers Pope to the little lady netting at his\r\nelbow. Statesmanship should have pleasures worthy of its toils; and so\r\nthought Letitia when her husband first mutely pointed out to her the\r\nwoods of Weston.\r\n\r\nSweet was the leisure of the first afternoon, which gave promise of what\r\nshould be done at future intervals of leisure;—intervals not likely to\r\nbe too frequent to retain their charm. His lordship had brought his\r\nbusiness and its apparatus with him; but for this day all was laid\r\naside. Within half an hour after alighting from the carriage, and while\r\ndinner was being served up, my lord and lady were in the rosery,\r\nobserving on what must have been its beauty a few weeks before, and the\r\none pointing out and the other following with eager eyes the tracts\r\namong the hanging woods which had to be explored, the points of view\r\nwhich must be visited, one at sunrise, one in the glowing noon, another\r\nin the still evening. As soon as dinner was over, they were out again,\r\nthat Letitia might see the ruins of the old abbey before the sunlight\r\nshould have departed. Her heart melted within her when she saw the long\r\nshadows of the lofty arch extended on the velvet turf, motionless except\r\nwhen a bird took wing from among the ivy, and set its boughs dancing.\r\nThe rooks sailed in circles above the stately ruin, and the thrush piped\r\nfrom the evergreen covert which shut in the retired nook in which it\r\nstood. The sun-dial also marked the silent lapse of time, although there\r\nwas usually none to lay the lesson to heart.\r\n\r\n“This is the place, love,” said lord F——.\r\n\r\n“And you would have had me come without you,” said Letitia, after a long\r\npause.\r\n\r\n“We have some weeks yet, to be sure, to enjoy it. This is the last spot\r\nthat looks desolate as winter comes on. No leafless trees, no strewn\r\nblossoms! The wall-flowers there on the pinnacle flourish late; and all\r\nis green and bright till the snow falls.”\r\n\r\n“And after, surely,” said Letitia. “I should like to see icicles\r\nglistening on these arches, springing grey from the sheeted snow. I\r\nshould like to see the ivy sprays bending under their white burden, or\r\nshaking it off in a shower of sparkles at the breeze’s bidding. O let us\r\ncome here at Christmas!”\r\n\r\n“If we do, you may chance to see another sight. You will see tracks of\r\nsmall feet in the snow, and catch some little girl, in her red cloak,\r\nstealing from the Wishing-Well.”\r\n\r\n“The Wishing-Well! O where?”\r\n\r\n“It springs from under an old stump behind this wall. Have you any\r\nwishes?”\r\n\r\n“I will make some for the superstition’s sake.”\r\n\r\nAnd immediately Letitia might be seen unbonneted, kneeling on the\r\nconsecrated stone, and drinking the draught her husband had filled for\r\nher. Thus was she seen, as presently appeared. A voice reached them from\r\none side, praying that her ladyship’s wishes might come to pass, be they\r\nwhat they might, as they must be for good and no harm to the people\r\nunder her. Letitia sprang up, laughing, and her husband replaced her\r\nhat, calling to the well-wisher to show himself. He did so, not in the\r\nshape of a hardy labourer, with his farming or gardening tools on his\r\nshoulder; nor yet of a picturesque old man bending beneath his faggot.\r\nSuch might better have beseemed the place: but this was a middle-aged,\r\nshrewd-looking little man, whom one would have guessed to be town-bred.\r\nHe came forward, saying that he had a message for her ladyship from his\r\nwife;—my lord knew his wife.\r\n\r\n“Not I,” said his lordship. “I did not know you had a wife.”\r\n\r\n“May be not, my lord; but you know the woman. She that keeps the grocery\r\nshop, as you turn the corner in the village, your lordship remembers.”\r\n\r\n“What! Nanny Sweet? So you have taken her to wife since I saw you last.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my lord. She has a very good business, or had before the equality\r\nfolks set up a store against us. I don’t like equality, not I. But my\r\nwife sends word, my lady....”\r\n\r\n“You do not like equality!” interrupted Letitia. “If there was equality,\r\nyou know, you would not need to mind who set up a store, and what came\r\nof your wife’s grocery business.—And do not you like this place\r\ntoo,—these woods, and the deer, and the lake?”\r\n\r\nWhite lauded the grandeur and beauty of Weston.\r\n\r\n“Well; this place would be as much yours as ours if there was equality.\r\nYou might fish on the lake, and shoot in the preserves, and....”\r\n\r\n“And lie down to sleep in the sun here beside the well,” continued lord\r\nF——; “and all without asking anybody’s leave.”\r\n\r\n“I thank you kindly, my lord; but I like sleeping in my bed, if I sleep\r\nat all, unless it be dozing over my pipe, while Jack is reading the news\r\nat the Duke’s Head. The only time I went fishing, I fell into the water;\r\nso you’ll not soon find me in a boat again. My wife and I like a chicken\r\nnow and then, on Sundays; so a share of your poultry-yard would be\r\nwelcome perhaps; and, as for the deer and game, I leave it to other\r\nfolks to get out of their warm beds for the sake of it. It would not\r\nanswer to me to be laid by with the rheumatism for such a cause, you\r\nsee.”\r\n\r\n“But there would be no poaching if there was equality,” said Letitia,\r\nlaughing. “Cannot game be shot in the daytime?”\r\n\r\n“By none but gentlemen, my lady, as I have always heard. However, the\r\nequality folks have no more game, as far as I know, than other people.\r\nThe most they pretend to is to have plenty of butcher’s meat.—What I\r\npretend to, and Nanny too, is to get our bread honestly; and so, my\r\nlady, she bade me tell you that she has laid in a new stock, hearing\r\nyour ladyship was coming, and has lost already by its being September\r\ninstead of June. Light ginghams for morning wear....”\r\n\r\n“I thought your wife was a grocer.”\r\n\r\n“Grocer and draper, my lady. If your ladyship should find the mornings\r\nchilly, as they will be soon, perhaps you would look at her stuffs;—a\r\nvery pretty variety of browns, as you will see, my lady. And her tea and\r\nsugar is of the best; and as for her snuffs....”\r\n\r\n“O, I must make acquaintance with her snuffs, of course. Have you a\r\npinch about you?”\r\n\r\n“And what is your occupation now, White?” inquired lord F——.\r\n\r\n“The last thing I had to do, my lord, was lining your lordship’s pew at\r\nchurch, and covering the hassocks.”\r\n\r\n“And what did your priest say to that?”\r\n\r\n“Lord, sir, I cleared scores with the priest long ago; ever since I was\r\nemployed to white-wash the Baptist chapel.”\r\n\r\n“Were you once a Catholic?” inquired Letitia.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my lady. There was carving work to do at Sir William’s chapel, and\r\nI got a good long job.”\r\n\r\n“And were a Catholic while it lasted, and a Baptist after white-washing\r\nthe meeting-house?”\r\n\r\n“To be sure, my lady; I took a part in the week-day meetings after\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\n“Till you were employed to line my pew; and now, I dare say, you are a\r\nvery good churchman?”\r\n\r\n“I hope to be so, my lord. Your lordship may laugh, but I know what\r\nmanners is. I wouldn’t be so unhandsome as to take work at one place,\r\nand attend at another.”\r\n\r\n“So your interest has nothing at all to do with it, White; only manners.\r\nBut I wonder now what you think your religion is worth, if you can\r\nchange and change again as you have done?”\r\n\r\n“Why, my lord, I think religion is a very good thing, as long as it does\r\nnot come in one’s way: but one must make sacrifices to duty, as all the\r\nclergy tell us; and is it not my duty to get my living the best way I\r\ncan?”\r\n\r\n“Well, White; tell your wife I will step down to see her stock, some day\r\nsoon. I do not at present take snuff; but whenever I do, I will be her\r\ncustomer.”\r\n\r\nThérèse and her mistress kept one another waiting this night. The\r\nhousekeeper, who was much amused with Thérèse’s broken English and\r\nunbroken simplicity, invited her out to a turn in the shrubberies when\r\ntea was sent in, and she was sure of not being wanted for an hour or\r\ntwo. When they came in again, they found that their master and mistress\r\nhad once more wandered forth, tempted by the rising of the clear full\r\nmoon behind the woods. After sitting nearly an hour in the\r\ndressing-room, Thérèse put faith in the housekeeper’s prophecy that her\r\nmaster would stay abroad till after midnight, like a child as he always\r\nwas, or one that lived on air, the first few days after his coming down\r\nfrom town. Thérèse looked out and longed for another ramble. The\r\ndressing-room lamp shed a pearly light through the room; but a golden\r\nplanet hung over the opposite beechen grove: a small bright fire burned\r\nin the grate; but it was less cheering than the bracing evening air: the\r\ntime-piece ticked drowsily amidst the silence; but it was less soothing\r\nthan the coming and going of the night-breeze among the elms in the\r\ngreen walk. Thérèse could not resist. Once more she ran out, promising\r\nherself that she would be back in ten minutes,—long before her mistress\r\nshould be ready for her. In an hour, startled by the striking of the\r\nvillage clock, she returned, and found Letitia, half undressed, still\r\ngazing from the window.\r\n\r\n“Ah, madam!” cried Thérèse, terrified; “I am very, very wrong....”\r\n\r\nAs she hastened, with trembling hands, to throw off her cloak, and\r\narrange the toilet-table, appealing the while to the moon and other\r\ntemptations, Letitia, under a sudden impulse, ran and kissed the\r\nastonished Thérèse, crying, “O Thérèse, how happy we shall be here!”\r\nThérèse returned the kiss again and again before she stopped to consider\r\nwhat she was about. As soon as Letitia could repress her inclination to\r\nlaugh, she observed that they seemed all to have set aside common rules\r\nto-day, and to have their heads turned alike by coming into the country.\r\nAfter this, Thérèse would be in waiting at the proper hour, and she\r\nherself....\r\n\r\n“And you, madam ...” said Thérèse, half-smiling. “You will not make me\r\nforget that there is one in this country who loves me as some love me at\r\nhome; but this will redouble my respect, madam.”\r\n\r\n“I hope it will, Thérèse; for I need to be reminded now and then.... I\r\nwas not always lady F——, you know; and a moon-light night makes me\r\nforget these things sometimes. We are all equal in reality, except when\r\nignorance, and all that comes of ignorance, separates us from one\r\nanother; so there may be friendship,—there is friendship between you and\r\nme, Thérèse.”\r\n\r\n“The knowledge which you have given me, madam, will make this friendship\r\nmy secret treasure. No one will know it who cannot also be your\r\nfriend.—But many ladies put confidence in their maids, and tell them\r\nsuch things as I have never heard from you. Mrs. Philips....”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Philips, I suspect, Thérèse, had much more to tell than she ever\r\nwas told; at least, her secrets were of a kind that will never be known\r\nto come from me. Your confessor shall never have to warn you against\r\nme,—unless, indeed, it be my heresy. I would not spoil you, my dear; and\r\nthat is the reason why I keep you so much with me. It would be hard if I\r\ndid not love you and let you love me. Now go to bed; and when the sun\r\nshines, instead of the moon, we must forget all the wild things we have\r\ndone this first day.”\r\n\r\n“I shall never be fit to be a countess,” was her confession to lord F——;\r\n“I kissed my maid last night.”\r\n\r\n“What, Philips!”\r\n\r\n“O no, no. That would be idiotcy. Philips is at Brighton, you know,\r\nwhere lady Frances spoils her by a more pernicious familiarity than mine\r\nwith Thérèse. But really this girl wins one’s heart as if she had been\r\nborn one’s younger sister.”\r\n\r\n“I dare say she is some countess, or countess’s daughter in disguise; or\r\nso some romantic ladies might fancy.”\r\n\r\n“Ladies who think that nobility is only hereditary. There is disguised\r\nnobility in Thérèse; but her patent is sealed with an impress which\r\nthere are few to recognize, and it is deposited where not many trouble\r\nthemselves to look for it.”\r\n\r\n“Side by side with yours, love. Happily, your nobility of that better\r\nkind needs be disguised no more than the lesser which you have acquired.\r\nThis was the chief satisfaction I had in giving you the lesser.”\r\n\r\n“We will look among the equality folks, as White calls them, for\r\nspecimens of natural nobility. According to their theory, such always\r\nassumes its rank among them, does it not?”\r\n\r\n“This is one of the professed objects of their system; but it is not\r\nfair to look for its fulfilment in such small societies as they have yet\r\nbeen able to form. Master minds are thinly sown.”\r\n\r\n“There needs not equality of outward condition,” observed Letitia, “to\r\nmake the best minds master minds. Those who, by virtue of a patent of\r\nmental nobility, have held sway over the national mind, have been of all\r\nranks.”\r\n\r\n“And will so continue to be; for, as long as men are unlike one another,\r\nthere will be a distinction of ranks, though the distinction may be\r\nmaintained by a better principle than heritage. Rank and wealth will, I\r\ntrust, be in time distributed according to natural laws; but degrees of\r\nrank and wealth there will always be; and the advocates of a system of\r\nequality would greatly promote their cause by a frank recognition of\r\nthis truth. While all evidence from which a judgment can be formed is\r\nbefore them, and they come to a conclusion in direct opposition to the\r\nevidence, I cannot, however much I may respect them on some accounts,\r\nthink them wise and safe guides of the people. The necessity of\r\ninequality of condition may be established thus.”\r\n\r\n“But first tell me whether their favourite principle of co-operation\r\nnecessarily involves equality of condition.”\r\n\r\n“They would tell you ‘yes.’ I say ‘no.’ They hold that competition is\r\nboth the cause and effect of inequality of condition; whereas certain\r\nadvocates of co-operation in another country hold, (and I think wisely,)\r\nthat their principle stands a better chance where a gradation of rank\r\nand property is allowed. I so far agree with these last as to believe\r\nthe time to be discernible when co-operation, in a certain sense, shall\r\nprevail,—meaning thereby, when all interests shall be harmonized instead\r\nof opposed; but that this includes equality of condition, I cannot\r\nallow, since varieties of character seem to me to forbid such equality.”\r\n\r\n“There must be an inequality of physical and mental powers, at all\r\nevents.”\r\n\r\n“Surely; and therefore an inequality in the produce of individual\r\nlabour. No one labours, or ever will labour, without a view to the\r\nfruits; and those fruits, however appropriated, are property. If a giant\r\nproduces ten times as much as a dwarf, and each is allowed the same\r\nmiddle portion of the fruits, for his maintenance and enjoyment, is it\r\nto be supposed that the giant will trouble himself henceforth to produce\r\nmore than the dwarf?”\r\n\r\n“He will be more likely to seize some of the dwarf’s portion.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; and hence it is clear that the only security of society lies\r\nin awarding to all their rights, and enforcing upon all their duties;\r\nand what are _rights_ but a man’s exclusive power over his own produce?\r\nWhat are his _duties_ but allowing to others the possession of their\r\nproduce?”\r\n\r\n“You do not think then that the giant and the dwarf would be alike\r\ncontented with having everything they could want or wish for\r\nadministered to them in return for a certain portion of their labour.\r\nYou do not look forward to the lion dandling the kid.”\r\n\r\n“I should be afraid the lion would be dandling the kid when he ought to\r\nbe out in quest of food. If there was no inducement to giants to produce\r\nmore than dwarfs, there would soon be little to administer to anybody.\r\nThe consumption of giants would soon have to be provided for by the\r\nlabour of a community of dwarfs.”\r\n\r\n“The giants would foresee this, and then....”\r\n\r\n“Instead of working harder for no recompense, they would withdraw,—the\r\nmightiest first, and then the next strongest, and so on, till the\r\nweakest of the dwarfs would be left to shift for themselves as they best\r\nmight.”\r\n\r\n“And then would come the days of potatoes and wooden trenchers, of which\r\nyou were speaking one day.—But this is supposing men to have the same\r\npassions and desires that they have now; whereas they are to be educated\r\ninto a better state.”\r\n\r\n“With all my heart: but the utmost that education can do is to extend\r\nman’s views, to exalt his aims, to strengthen and vivify his powers,—not\r\nto change his nature. His nature involves inequality of powers; and this\r\ndecree of Providence can never be set aside, or its operation\r\nneutralized by any decree of man that the fruits of those powers shall\r\nbe equally divided.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not; for such a decree of man involves injustice. If the\r\ngiant feels it to be unjust that he must give to others the fruits of\r\nhis labour, the dwarf may also complain that he enjoys no more than the\r\ngiant, though he works ten times as hard.”\r\n\r\n“The dwarf’s complaint would thus be against Providence, and the giant’s\r\nagainst man; but both show that equality is an arbitrary state, good\r\nneither for each nor for all. Nothing but compulsion would retain the\r\ngiant in it long; and thus it is clear that, where there is liberty,\r\nthere cannot be equality.”\r\n\r\n“What becomes of the old cry of Liberty and Equality?”\r\n\r\n“It relates, I imagine, to an equality of rights. It means an open field\r\nand fair play to every one. This kind of equality I am doing all I can\r\nin my office to procure, by doing away with the protection to some which\r\nimposes burdens upon others. By the same principle I am bound to oppose\r\nthat arbitrary equality which enriches the weak with the fruits of the\r\nstrongman’s labours.”\r\n\r\n“But there is no force used. All who bind themselves to equality do it\r\nvoluntarily.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. The only applicable force is force of argument, and the\r\nopposition I bring is an opposition of reasons. If these should not\r\nprevail, a little experience will soon finish the business. I am only\r\nsorry that any should be dazzled with a delusive prospect of ease and\r\nluxury, when their efforts should be guided in another direction for the\r\nrelief of their grievous burdens. At a time when every one should be\r\nbent on regulating the labour market, providing for the utmost permanent\r\ngrowth of capital, and lessening the burdens of taxation, we cannot\r\nspare any from these grand objects to be urging on the increase of\r\ncapital at the expense of a much greater increase of population, and\r\namusing themselves with visions of what can never be achieved by the\r\nmeans they propose. Man must and will be better served as the world\r\ngrows older; but it will be by giving the eternal laws of society fair\r\nplay, and not by attempting to subvert them. I shall be surprised if you\r\nhear anything from our neighbours in the village which will not bear the\r\nconstruction I have put upon the system as laid down by its\r\noriginators.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose I make myself popular among them at once by telling them my\r\ntale of last night.”\r\n\r\n“There is no need, my dear. I trust they do us the justice to believe\r\nthat our affections graduate according to a truer scale than that of\r\nhereditary rank.”\r\n\r\n“You have shown that they do by marrying me.”\r\n\r\n“All people show it in the most important circumstances of their\r\nlives,—in their attachments. Alas for man, if the movements within must\r\ncorrespond with the outward state! Whom then would kings love?”\r\n\r\n“And (what is more important) how should the poverty-stricken look up\r\nthrough the ranks above him, and say, with hope in his eye and assurance\r\nin his voice, ‘I am a brother?’ How else should the stirring thought be\r\nkept alive in him that his rights will not be for ever overlaid, his\r\nclaims not be for ever incompatible with those of his brethren? Natural\r\naffinities are ever acting, even now, in opposition to circumstance.\r\nThey will in time direct us to the due control of circumstance.\r\nMeanwhile, let no class imagine that any other class denies the\r\nexistence of these affinities, or resists their workings.—I will go and\r\nsee how they are acting in the village.—Shall I bring you some of Mrs.\r\nWhite’s snuff?”\r\n\r\n“Why, thank you, I am not aware of any affinity between a rappee\r\ncanister and my nostrils. But the old sexton is a snuff-taker. Call upon\r\nhim by all means, and show him that you understand his likings. He will\r\ngratify some of yours, if you find him in a talkative mood.”\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                           OBSERVING AT HAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nA tribe of little children had gathered round Mrs. White’s windows\r\nbefore Letitia and Thérèse arrived at the shop; the reason of which was\r\nthat the grocery and drapery goods were disposed in a new style of\r\nelegance, in honour of her ladyship. Such tempting candies in the one\r\nwindow; such shining pins, such a rainbow box of cottons, such rolls of\r\nribands, stuffs, calicoes, and flannels in the other! The little things\r\ncould not be persuaded to move off even when White, who was on the\r\nwatch, bustled about to make a clear path for the lady. There was plenty\r\nof bobbing from the girls, and pulling of forelocks from the boys;\r\nplenty of elbowing, and pushing, and signing, when it became necessary\r\nfor somebody to speak in answer to her kind questions; but there was no\r\ninclination to make way. They were even rude enough to crowd about the\r\ndoor and peep in, while she was buying snuff and sugar-candy.\r\n\r\nLetitia soon found that if White was shrewd in changing his occupation\r\nand profession according to circumstances, his wife was no less shrewd\r\nin understanding and conducting her own. It would be a wonder, the lady\r\nthought, if between them, they did not prove a match for their\r\nco-operative neighbours.\r\n\r\n“I charge you the lowest, ma’am, the lowest, I assure you; and as low as\r\nis fair....”\r\n\r\n“O, I have no doubt of it, Mrs. White. I am not going to dispute your\r\nprices, I assure you.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, my lady, I don’t go by the rules of the folks over the way; and\r\nwhy? Because they talk of charging only the interest of what their stock\r\ncosts them; while I must have profit too, and that is interest twice\r\nover.”\r\n\r\n“The other half is what you live on, Mrs. White, instead of consuming\r\npart of their stock, you know.”\r\n\r\n“True, madam. Double interest is fair profit, as my father used to say;\r\nand he, being a schoolmaster, knew the right of such things.”\r\n\r\n“And taught them to you, it seems. But you do not mean to say that all\r\nprofit is double interest. There is your neighbour, the apothecary, he\r\ncharges at a much higher rate for his medicines.”\r\n\r\n“Aye,” said White. “His is a fine conjuring trade. He shakes up three or\r\nfour things in a bottle, and what was worth twopence is directly charged\r\ntwo shillings.”\r\n\r\n“But consider, John, this is not all profit. Think what he paid for his\r\nlearning, and what time he gives up to his patients. He has to pay\r\nhimself for all this out of his drugs.”\r\n\r\n“Then why not call some of his gains wages at once, and charge his\r\npatients for such, instead of pretending to give his time and labour,\r\nand charging his medicines ten times dearer than he need?”\r\n\r\n“Many wish to be allowed to do this, I understand,” said Letitia. “They\r\ndislike the temptation to cram their patients with medicine, in order to\r\nrepay the expenses of their education; and they wish it to be\r\nunderstood, that when we pay for a blister or a powder, we pay for\r\nmedical skill and aid, as well as for Spanish flies or bark. In the same\r\nway, nobody supposes that great physicians charge guineas for writing\r\nfive lines of a prescription, or lawyers for reading over a sheet of\r\nparchment.”\r\n\r\n“There is the risk in their case,” observed White, “as well as the\r\neducation. For one that gets rich in their profession, there are many\r\nthat make but little; and this uncertainty ought to have a large\r\nreward.”\r\n\r\n“If it was not for such uncertainty, my lady, I could sell some of my\r\ngoods cheaper. But in a place like this, I can never make sure of\r\nselling a new article, as I could in a large town; so, when I venture\r\nupon any thing new, I must charge it high to make up for my money being\r\nlocked up, perhaps, and for the damage of the goods from lying by.”\r\n\r\n“Like a hackney coachman in a town,” observed Letitia. “Coach fares are\r\ncomplained of, as if a driver had to charge only for driving from one\r\npoint to another; but besides the interest of the money his coach and\r\nhorses cost him, and the expense of repairs, he must charge the wages of\r\nthe many hours and days that he and his horses are idle on the stand.”\r\n\r\n“Well now, ma’am, there is one set of people whose gains make me more\r\nangry than almost any thing I can mention; and they are the public\r\nplayers and singers, and such like folks.”\r\n\r\nWhite here came round the counter to his wife’s side, and kicked, and\r\nwinked, and coughed, till Nanny and Thérèse were amazed, and Letitia\r\nlaughed. Nanny went on,\r\n\r\n“Lord, John, I know more about that sort of people than you think, from\r\nthere being a company playing in Mr. Jarvis’s barn; and I assure you,\r\nma’am, the satins they pretended to wear were all glazed calico; and the\r\njewels, my lady, were all made of tinfoil. Well; they got, even in a\r\npoor place like this, ever so much more than their living could have\r\ncost them; and I have heard of some of the better sort,—London actresses\r\nand such,—making more in a night than an apothecary in a whole year. Why\r\nnow, John, what should you know about it, to object in this way? I tell\r\nyou....”\r\n\r\n“I can tell you that it is true,” said Letitia; “and I can tell you the\r\nreason. Besides the uncertainty, which is much greater in those\r\nprofessions than in any other, there is a kind of discredit belonging to\r\nthem; so that it requires a very strong inducement to tempt people of\r\ngreat talent to engage in them. When the time comes,—and I expect it\r\nwill come,—for public singers and actors to be treated with proper\r\nrespect, the best of them will not be paid extravagantly, and the\r\ninferior ones will not be half-starved, as they are now. There will be\r\nno disgrace, and less uncertainty; and payment will therefore be more\r\nequal.”\r\n\r\n“Then perhaps scavengers will be paid no more than plough-boys; for\r\nreally, it seems to me wrong that there should be any reproach against\r\nscavengers on account of their occupation. You ladyship will excuse my\r\nmentioning them before you.”\r\n\r\n“To be sure, Mrs. White, since we both think them a respectable class,\r\nin as far as they are useful. But they are paid high, as much on account\r\nof the disagreeableness of their business as its being ill thought of.\r\nPlumbers, and gilders, and miners, and distillers are paid more than\r\nshepherds and gardeners, because their business is less healthy and\r\nagreeable than those which are carried on in the open air, and in\r\nperfect safety.”\r\n\r\n“Well, ma’am, I suppose it is all fair and even in the end; but it seems\r\nvery much like chance; for people do not stop to consider the\r\npleasantness, or the easiness, or the constancy, or the certainty of the\r\nbusiness of the person they are paying, or the trust they put in him.\r\nThey think of no such things when they go to the play, or buy early\r\nstrawberries.”\r\n\r\n“True; there are no such nice distinctions on all occasions; nor are\r\nthey necessary; but yet there is no chance in the matter. When a duke\r\nfees his physician, and his duchess pays her jeweller’s bill, the\r\nnobleman does not calculate the expense at which his physician acquired\r\nhis profession, and the long time he waited for practice; nor does the\r\nlady think of the costly stock of her tradesman, and the delicate nature\r\nof his workmanship; and yet, these are the circumstances which determine\r\nthe recompense of each. If it was as easy to be a physician as a\r\nplough-boy, there would be as many physicians as plough-boys; and if a\r\ndiamond necklace required no more capital and skill than a bunch of\r\nasparagus, there would be as many jewellers as green-grocers; and then\r\nphysicians and jewellers would be paid no more than ploughmen and\r\ngreen-grocers.”\r\n\r\n“But, my lady, we do not want so many physicians as ploughmen.”\r\n\r\n“True; and it is therefore a very happy thing that fewer can be the one\r\nthan the other. If we leave the rewards of labour to take their natural\r\ncourse, we shall find that there always turns up a larger quantity of\r\nthe sort we want most, and a lesser quantity of the sort we want least.\r\nIn profits, I suppose, Mrs. White, you find less variety than in wages.\r\nIt is of wages, you know, that we have been talking since we began about\r\nthe apothecary.”\r\n\r\n“Why, my lady, there is a disagreeable and an agreeable way of making\r\nprofits of stock; and there is, I am sure, much more risk in some cases\r\nthan others.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but there is no consideration of the easiness or the difficulty of\r\nselling things, or of the trust put in the seller, as there is in the\r\nmanufacture of the thing sold. A smuggler, or any other kind of\r\nspeculator, may make more one month, and lose more the next, than the\r\nregular trader pretends to calculate; but, I fancy, if we were able to\r\nsee into the affairs of all the people in this village, or in any town,\r\nwe should find less difference in what people make from an equal amount\r\nof stock, than from an equal quantity of labour. Your rule, of double\r\ninterest being fair profit, shows this.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, my lady; or there would not be steady sellers of so many\r\nkinds of stock. People would choose the most profitable; which they\r\nmight do more easily in selling goods than making them. My husband\r\nshifts his labour, as I believe he told you, from one employment to\r\nanother;—(well for him that he can!) And I should shift my little\r\ncapital from one kind of goods to another, if there was any real and\r\nlasting difference in the profits they would bring. But I don’t find\r\nthat crockery would bring higher profits than grocery, and so I go on\r\nbeing a grocer; and the butcher down the street finds he makes as much\r\nof his joints as I of my stuffs, one time with another; and if he did\r\nnot, I suppose his wife would turn draper.—We all find means to live;\r\nthough I am sorry to say our profits are lower than they were; and if\r\nall my good father said be true, they will be lower still ten years\r\nhence.”\r\n\r\n“Is that the sexton?” inquired Letitia, seeing an old man pass with a\r\nlarge key in his hand. It was, and John White must be going to see if\r\nall was right in his lordship’s pew, as the sexton was evidently about\r\nto open the church. Letitia paid for her purchases and followed, as one\r\nof her objects was to see the church as well as the sexton. Several\r\nneighbours popped into Nanny’s shop before she had cleared her counter,\r\nto hear what the lady could have been saying and doing all this while.\r\nNanny looked rather grand and mysterious, chiefly observing upon the\r\ncomfort of having got somebody into the neighbourhood that one might\r\nspeak to with some chance of being understood. She was a lady of sense\r\nand learning....\r\n\r\n“Though she did not go to school to your father, Nanny.”\r\n\r\n“If she did not, she went to school to somebody that taught her to\r\nrespect what my father taught me, neighbour; and so far, there are some\r\nfolks that might take a lesson from her.”\r\n\r\nOn this, the wink went round, and the neighbours dropped off, leaving\r\nNanny to muse on what fancy could have possessed her husband to tread on\r\nher toes and twitch her gown when she spoke of the strolling players.\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                            OBSERVING AFAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old sexton pursued his way to the church without looking behind him,\r\nthough made aware by the bustle around that strangers were in his rear.\r\nIt was not old Joel’s way to alter his pace or his purposes for man or\r\nwoman, be they who they might. Children only had any power over him; and\r\nthey only as long as they were unconscious of it.\r\n\r\n“Is the sexton one of the equality folks?” asked Letitia of White.\r\n\r\n“What, old Joel? Really, madam, there is no saying what he is, further\r\nthan that he is discontented with everybody’s ways of thinking in\r\nturn.—Joel! Joel!” he cried, as the sexton was busied in unlocking the\r\nwhite gate of the churchyard, “my lady asks if you are an equality man.”\r\n\r\nThe old man muttered something unintelligible while engaged with the\r\nlock; but when he looked up and met Letitia’s eye, her countenance,—not\r\nits beauty, but the sincerity of its expression,—acted as a charm upon\r\nhis reserve. They exchanged smiles, and understood one another\r\nimmediately. Joel did not, like Nanny White, congratulate himself aloud\r\non having met with a congenial companion, but he felt himself happy in\r\nhaving done so.\r\n\r\n“Will you please to tell me, madam, what you are here for?”\r\n\r\n“To see the church, and to make acquaintance with you, Joel.”\r\n\r\n“Because you are curious about my way of thinking?”\r\n\r\n“I have no idea what your way of thinking is; but I should certainly\r\nlike to know, because it is the first thing I try to find out when I\r\nmake new acquaintances.”\r\n\r\n“Then, madam, you and I shall suit. If such is your custom, you will not\r\ndo as the world for the most part does; you will not first suppose that\r\na man must be wise for having gone through all the chances and changes\r\nthat can be crowded into a long life, and then think his opinions very\r\nwicked or very foolish because they may be such as you did not look for.\r\nWhy, say I, should I feel and think like you? Have you been first young\r\nand then old? Have you been looked upon as a scholar in your prime and\r\nan oddity in old age? Have you been on the other half of the world, and\r\nhave you now only the sunny side of a churchyard for your range? Have\r\nyou had ten children round your table, and do you now come to eat your\r\nsolitary crust upon their graves? If not, why should you expect me to\r\nthink like you? And how will you dare to point at me and pity me because\r\npain and pleasure have sharpened my mind’s sight to pierce further into\r\nthings than you, who, may be, see only the outsides of them, or, may be,\r\nonly the mists that cover them? Follow me, madam, unless your limbs are\r\nmore feeble than an old man’s, as many a fine lady’s are.”\r\n\r\nAs Joel turned to lead the way, White ventured upon a sly wink to the\r\nlady, but presently fell behind, abashed by the steady gravity with\r\nwhich it was met.\r\n\r\nThe church stood on a mound, and its tower, therefore, though of\r\nmoderate height, rose conspicuously above the trees which belted the\r\nchurchyard; and from its parapet might be obtained a glorious view of\r\nthe surrounding country. Joel did not pause or speak till he had\r\nconducted Letitia and Thérèse out upon the leads.—Instead of fixing her\r\nattention on the nearer beauties of the park and village which lay\r\nstretched beneath, the uplands that rose beyond, and the towers and\r\nspires of the great city which might just be discerned on the western\r\nhorizon, Letitia gazed eagerly towards the south, where a dim haze\r\nstained the blue of an autumn sky.\r\n\r\n“It is ... is it possible? ... yes, it must be the sea!”\r\n\r\n“What is it you see, my lady?”\r\n\r\n“I see a faint yellow strip of beach, and an even grey line which must\r\nbe the ocean. O yes! there is a sparkle, and no other light or motion\r\ncan be seen so far.”\r\n\r\n“Aye,” said Joel, laughing, “that is ever the way those pronounce who\r\nhave seen little. What think you of volcano fires, my lady, quivering\r\nover two hundred miles of a midnight sea? What think you of an avalanche\r\nsparkling as it slides from the highest pinnacle of the Andes? There are\r\nthings, for that matter, that you have seen. What think you of the\r\nnorthern lights, or of our own shining, changing moon? Is she not so far\r\noff as yonder sea?”\r\n\r\n“I was rash in what I said, Joel. But I wish that mist was away that I\r\nmight find a sail. Look, look, Thérèse! Is there anything?... Do you see\r\nany form come out from amidst the haze?”\r\n\r\nThérèse not having fixed her sight so long, could discern nothing; but\r\nher mistress satisfied herself that a vessel was visible, and at length,\r\nby dint of attention, could make out first the hull, then the sails,\r\nthen one, then two more vessels in its train, and at last, a whole\r\nfleet.\r\n\r\n“Why do you not insist on your servant seeing them too?” asked the old\r\nphilosopher. “’Twould be just as reasonable as quarrelling, as the\r\npeople do down below, about what they see with their minds’ eyes. Bring\r\nthem up here. One will say that yonder haze is nothing more than a\r\nblotch upon a bright sky; another won’t trouble himself to look, but\r\nbelieves it is a mountain, or a city, or whatever other folks tell him\r\nit is. You, madam, see that within the mist which interests you more\r\nthan the whole landscape besides; but, depend upon it, you will find\r\nplenty of people to assure you that ’tis all fancy that you perceive\r\nanything.”—Turning to Thérèse, he said, “Now you believe the lady that\r\nshe sees a fleet, I dare say?”\r\n\r\n“I do. Madame is not apt to see visions, and she ever speaks truth. Do\r\nnot you believe?”\r\n\r\n“I do. What a world of trouble it would save if we had a few people that\r\ncould discern as far off, and tell what they saw as faithfully about\r\nthings that will outlast the sea; or even about some notions that will\r\npass away long before yon fleet has all been sunk, or beaten to pieces,\r\nor decayed!”\r\n\r\n“You mean,” said Letitia, anxious to prove the old man’s scholarship,\r\n“what a pity it is that there is nobody to look out and tell us what\r\ntruths there are holding their course within the mists in which our\r\nsystems of religion, and politics, and science, and—above all—of\r\nsociety, are shrouded.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, madam: but, after all, if there were such, would any believe them?\r\nOr, if some did and others did not, would there not follow a quarrel?\r\nBelieve me, madam, (for I know every man, woman, and child, that lives\r\nbeneath the roofs we are looking down upon,) there is not a spot beyond\r\nthe belt of this churchyard,—bright and quiet as all looks, with not a\r\nleaf stirring in yonder woods,—there is not a spot where human beings\r\nare content with each other,—not a place above the sod where they can\r\ndwell side by side in perfect peace.—Some even quarrel about what is to\r\nbecome of themselves and their neighbours when they are laid under the\r\nsod. The children, indeed, tell one another such tales as it is pleasant\r\nto hear about the pretty place under ground, all cool and green and\r\ndaisied, where they are to lie and sleep till all are gathered together;\r\nbut as they grow up and are taken, one to Sir William’s chapel on the\r\nhill there, and another to the meeting-house in the village below, and\r\nanother here....”\r\n\r\nLetitia, perceiving that Thérèse began to look alarmed about what might\r\nbe coming, interrupted Joel with the remark that it would be surprising\r\nif there were not difference of opinion on a subject so remote from\r\nhuman ken as the modes of future being. It was far more desirable that\r\nthere should be agreement as to what should be done above ground to make\r\nlife peaceful and happy; the most to be enjoyed in itself, and the\r\nfittest possible preparation for a higher and better.\r\n\r\n“There is full as much quarrelling about this as about the other\r\nmatter,” said old Joel. “There is your own mansion, madam. There, if I\r\nam rightly told, sits lord F——, sighing over the distresses of\r\nthousands, and finding fault with the management of those that have held\r\nhis office before him. In yonder new farm lives a man who is annoyed by\r\nthe complaints of his neighbours on account of his having undertaken the\r\ntillage of some inferior lands, owing to which, the profits of their\r\nseveral occupations must fall. In the old abbey farm below, there is\r\ndiscontent at rents being raised by the same means. In our village shop,\r\nthere is jealousy of the neighbouring co-operatives; and these\r\nco-operatives themselves, congratulating one another as they do on\r\nhaving found out the road to prosperity, shake their heads in a very\r\nmelancholy way over the impiety of holding lands, and the injustice of\r\nrewarding labour in such a faulty manner as by paying coin. There are\r\nmuch worse things than these. There is life lost in smuggling contests\r\non the coast you are looking at; and life wasted and worn in ill-paid\r\nlabour in the rich fields below; and life embittered by hunger and cold\r\nin yonder hovels where the jolly hunt is now sweeping by. Everybody sees\r\nall this, and everybody boasts that he could cure it. All set about it\r\nin different ways, and nothing is done.”\r\n\r\n“I would scarcely say that nothing is done,” said Letitia. “Though\r\nlabour-notes may not prove so good a circulating medium as gold and\r\nsilver, it is something done for any body of men to have become\r\npractically convinced that it is labour which gives value to what we\r\nwould exchange. Though it is not at all likely that property in land\r\nwill be given up because the Jews, peculiar in all their institutions,\r\nheld theirs under a peculiar tenure, it is something gained that common\r\nattention is turned upon the tendency of our present system of\r\nland-holding, that so the causes of the increase of this species of\r\nproperty may be discovered in time to remove the impediments to a just\r\ndistribution. Depend upon it, something is gained by these divisions of\r\nopinion; and the more various they become, the nearer we are to a better\r\nplan of society. The more quickly opponents demolish the hinderances set\r\nup by one another, the sooner will the natural laws of distribution be\r\nleft free to work.”\r\n\r\n“Why should they not do the thing more quickly still, madam, by watching\r\nthe natural course of things? There might be an old man found in every\r\nvillage able to tell the changes that have come to pass since his\r\nboyhood in the value of the property, and the prosperity of the people\r\naround him, and wise enough to separate what belongs to the matter from\r\nwhat does not. I, for my part, can prove that our people here would not\r\nhave been richer if they had paid one another in labour-notes or goods,\r\ninstead of coin; and that if all the people within five miles round had\r\nmade an agreement fifty years ago to have everything in common, there\r\nwould now have been less wealth within these bounds, and far more people\r\nto consume it,—though we have too many already.”\r\n\r\n“Point out to me, Joel, any spot within sight where you have watched the\r\noperation of the natural laws of distribution, of which we hear so\r\nmuch.”\r\n\r\n“Alas! madam, there is no such spot in this kingdom. If there were,\r\nthere would be abundance and content everywhere, instead of the\r\ndifferences we have been talking of. What is the first of these laws?\r\nThat all labour should be free and voluntary.—Well; our people are not\r\nslaves, it is true; but can labour be called voluntary as to its amount,\r\nwhen a man must work sixteen hours a day to get just enough to keep him\r\nfrom starving?”\r\n\r\n“This comes of there being more labour than food; and this therefore\r\ncannot be remedied by equalization of property, since the rich man\r\nconsumes little more food than the poor man. It can be remedied only by\r\nbringing in more corn, or by sending out a portion of our surplus labour\r\nfrom among us.”\r\n\r\n“True. Well; the second law is that all the fruits of labour should be\r\nsecured to the producer. This is not done; for taxation swallows up a\r\ngrievous portion of what is produced.”\r\n\r\n“But the labourer chooses to exchange part of the fruits of his labour\r\nfor the sake of the protection of a government.”\r\n\r\n“The third law,” interrupted Joel, “is that all exchanges of these\r\nfruits ought to be free and voluntary. Let our labourers give something\r\nin exchange for social protection, and welcome; but never tell me that\r\nthey would willingly give as much as is now required from them in taxes,\r\nunless food was allowed so to abound as to afford a better recompense to\r\ntheir toil. While government checks the supply of food, the labourer\r\ncannot think the wealth he creates naturally distributed between the\r\ngovernment and himself.”\r\n\r\n“The co-operatives propose, I believe, to go on tilling more and more\r\nland as more food is wanted, and to give a sufficiency of its produce to\r\nevery labourer.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, madam, and many besides the co-operatives; but it would puzzle the\r\nwisest man among them to say where the sufficiency is to come from,\r\nafter a time; the return from land being less and less as time passes\r\non. Take the worst soil at present tilled....”\r\n\r\n“Or a better soil, subtracting the rent; for the return from all land is\r\nequal when the rent is deducted.”\r\n\r\n“Very true, madam. The produce is to be shared between the cultivator\r\nand his labourers, rent having nothing to do with the profits of the one\r\nor the wages of the other,—being the consequence entirely of the\r\ndifferent qualities of the land. Well; let this produce be divided into\r\nwages and profits in what proportion you will, both decline as numbers\r\nincrease and more food is wanted.”\r\n\r\n“How is it then that farmers’ labourers have many things in their\r\npossession that farmers’ labourers used not to have? More shoes and\r\nstockings, and cloth coats, and other manufactured articles?”\r\n\r\n“Because these things are more easily made, and cost less. A labourer\r\nmay now have a pair of shoes for half as much corn, we will say, as he\r\nmust have given for them some years ago. The same is the case with the\r\nfarmer who employs him; so, though each may receive double the quantity\r\nof certain goods that they did some years ago, it does not follow that\r\nthe rate of profits and wages is increased. If you reckoned the\r\nlabourer’s gains in shoes, you might say that his wages are doubled; but\r\nif you reckon them in relation to the farmers’ profits, you may find\r\nthem at the same time lowered; or that both wages and profits have in\r\none sense increased; in another not. This blinds many people to the fact\r\nthat wages and profits are continually declining.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, if land produces less and less, there must be a smaller\r\nproduce to divide between the capitalist and his labourers; and on the\r\nwhole, they must share the decline pretty equally; since the farmer\r\nwould not farm unless he could make some profit, and the labourers would\r\nnot labour but for subsistence. But I am afraid this decline pulls down\r\nthe profits of manufactures too; for farmers would turn manufacturers if\r\nthey could make higher profits thereby; and then there would be a new\r\ndemand for corn; the price would rise; farmers would return to farming,\r\nand would take in new land, the diminished produce of which would lower\r\nprofits again.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, madam: this is the way that agricultural profits determine all\r\nprofits; and that all are perpetually sinking. You see labour becomes\r\ndearer when corn is; that is, the labourer must have a certain quantity\r\nof corn in return for his labour, be its price what it may; and these\r\nhigher wages lessen profits again, without any advantage to the\r\nlabourer.”\r\n\r\n“Well, but the corn the farmer retains is higher in price.”\r\n\r\n“But less in quantity, my lady; and he has the prospect of employing\r\ndearer labour for a less return.”\r\n\r\n“It seems, then, as if wages determined profits, instead of profits\r\ndetermining wages. But I suppose it comes to the same thing where there\r\nare only two shares to depend on each other.”\r\n\r\n“There are greater changes, madam, in the supply of labour than in the\r\nmanner of using it; and while there are multitudes of eager, hungry\r\nlabourers, they will take care that the profits of stock shall not\r\ncommonly rise higher than just to make it answer to the capitalist to\r\ncarry on his business.”\r\n\r\n“But do these things actually take place? Do farmers turn manufacturers,\r\nand turn back again into farmers? and have you known any cases of their\r\nprofits falling?”\r\n\r\n“I am as sure of it, my lady, as the co-operatives themselves, whose\r\ntheme it constantly is. As for farmers changing,—you must remember that\r\nalmost all capitalists use borrowed capital, and that this capital\r\nfloats about continually, and is taken in where it is most wanted: so\r\nthat capital may be largely invested in one concern at one time, and\r\nanother at another, without much visible change in the occupations of\r\ncapitalists. As for the other matter,—I know a manufacturer in yon city,\r\nand the farmer in the abbey farm to have each employed ten men at 25_l._\r\nwages per annum, the highest they could afford to give, they said, since\r\nthey had now to pay 250_l._ instead of 200_l._, as formerly. A new man\r\ncame and took new land of the old farmer’s landlord; and he had to\r\nemploy eleven men to raise the same produce as the abbey farm yielded,\r\nand the price of corn rose. When the old farmer’s lease expired, he was\r\ncharged 25_l._ more rent to make him equal with the new farmer.”\r\n\r\n“So they paid 275_l._,—one for wages only, and the other for wages and\r\nthe additional rent; while the manufacturer paid only 250_l._”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but it was made up to them by the increased price of their\r\nproduce; so the profits of all were still equal. When labour should\r\nbecome dearer in consequence of this rise of price, the profits of all\r\nthree would fall together.”\r\n\r\n“And the labourer would not be better off, after all, Joel: only the\r\nland-owner, whose rent is incessantly rising. All this is exactly what\r\nthe co-operatives are complaining of, is it not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, madam. But how would co-operation mend the matter? However the\r\ntotal produce is divided, it still goes on lessening, while numbers\r\nincrease. This is the point, my lady. Do away as you will with the very\r\nnames of rent, profits, and wages,—throw all together in a lump into a\r\npublic treasury,—and there will still be less and less return to\r\ncapital, and more and more consumers to divide it. Co-operation,\r\nequalization, and all those things, cannot make all lands equally\r\nfertile, they cannot make capital grow as numbers grow; and unless they\r\ncould do these things, they can make no permanent provision for\r\nunlimited numbers; they cannot prevent the decline of profits, whether\r\nthose profits are taken by individuals, or thrown into the common\r\nstock.”\r\n\r\n“But how do you answer these co-operatives, Joel, when their complaints\r\nof the distresses of our peasantry are undeniably true?”\r\n\r\n“I answer by agreeing with them so far. Who can help it, for that\r\nmatter? Where is the town in this wide kingdom where hunger does not\r\nstalk ferociously through the streets, and howl in the dark alleys?\r\nWhere is the village where want does not wet the mother’s pillow with\r\ntears, and open untimely graves for the gentle and the manly? No, no! I\r\nhave seen too much to deny what so many are suffering: but this only\r\nmakes me the more anxious that false means of relief should not be\r\ntried. When I hear some crying out for this park of yours, my lady, to\r\nbe cut up into corn-fields and potato-gardens, or for cultivation to be\r\ncarried to the tops of yonder hills, or for all property to be held in\r\ncommon, I see that all this would only lead to tenfold misery, and I\r\ncry,—but nobody listens to an old man,—get corn whence you can get it\r\ncheapest;—send away as many of your people as you do not want to where\r\nthey are wanted;—and take care so to manage matters as that you may\r\nnever be overburdened with numbers again.—Often as I have said this,\r\nmadam, I never before said it with so much hope of being attended to. My\r\nlord can speak so as to be heard from one end of the empire to the\r\nother, and....”\r\n\r\n“And he likes to hear whatever is said from one end of the kingdom to\r\nthe other on these matters, Joel. He would fain have a wise old man out\r\nof every town and village, as you say, to relate the changes he has seen\r\nfrom boyhood till now. You must come one day soon, when lord F—— is at\r\nleisure, and tell us more of what you have seen at home and abroad.”\r\n\r\nAs they descended into the church, John White was seen standing at the\r\nentrance to the gallery in a state of great impatience. He had been\r\nkicking his heels, tapping the door-posts with his rule, and amusing\r\nhimself in sundry such ways for half an hour, while waiting for the\r\nparty, and now hastened forward to do the honours of her pew to lady\r\nF——, pointing out the comforts and elegancies of fire-place, cushioned\r\nchairs, curtain, &c.\r\n\r\n“Is this our seat?” said Letitia. “I do not like it at all.”\r\n\r\nWhite stared in amazement. Thérèse was too busy remarking the bareness\r\nof a Protestant church to take notice of what was going on.\r\n\r\n“It is a small, inconvenient church,” added Letitia, “and by no means\r\nmade the most of. Where do the school children sit?—What! down in that\r\nnarrow corner? This gallery is the proper place for them. After all your\r\ntrouble, White, we must have another arrangement.”\r\n\r\n“And where will your ladyship have all these things shifted?”\r\n\r\n“Nowhere,” replied she, smiling. “If a fire-place is wanted here at all,\r\nit is for the half-clad, and not for those who can wrap themselves in\r\nfurs; and this show of damask furniture does not beseem the place. I\r\nwill speak to lord F—— about a pew for us next that of the curate’s\r\nfamily, and fitted up in the same way.”\r\n\r\n“With matting underfoot, my lady, and dark green cushions, and below\r\nstairs too? Well to be sure! But your ladyship will have a curtain hung\r\nround?”\r\n\r\n“I see no use in it. Lord F—— does not sleep at church, or wish to be\r\nsupposed present when he is not.”\r\n\r\n“And the earl, and lady Frances,” said Joel, in a whisper. “What will\r\nthey think, my lady?”\r\n\r\n“They will, as our guests, be satisfied with our accommodations, Joel.\r\nAnd now show me down, that I may go and arrange this with lord F——, that\r\nour pew may be ready by Sunday.”\r\n\r\n“The old family monuments, my lady.”\r\n\r\n“I will wait to see those till lord F—— is with me. We will call for\r\nyou, the first morning he is at liberty. Meanwhile, there is much to\r\nstudy in the churchyard. We shall meet there sometimes, Joel.”\r\n\r\nThe lady and the old sexton did often meet there. Sometimes she went,\r\nsketch-book in hand, to sit in the porch or on the tombs; and then old\r\nJoel kept on the watch, just within sight, in hopes of being beckoned\r\nand invited to a conversation. At other times he would be there first in\r\nthe performance of his duty; and the lady, warned by the passing bell,\r\nwould come down and watch the process of grave-digging, gathering from\r\nhim many a tale of joy and sorrow; many a touching notice of repented\r\nsin; many an animating narrative of struggling virtue. Severe as old\r\nJoel was on the follies of the present times, no one could review the\r\npast more tenderly. It was soon perceived, however, that he became less\r\nreserved in his conduct, and less severe in his judgments towards the\r\nneighbours, as his friendship with lady F—— ripened. By the time he got\r\nto call her “my dear,” he had grown so familiar with one and another as\r\nto express his admiration of her. It was a pretty sight, he observed, to\r\nsee her out riding with a train of noble guests about her, and a\r\npleasant thing to hear that she was the gayest and fairest at all the\r\nlordly festivals in the country round; but it did an old man’s heart\r\ngood to have her come and watch the opening of graves, in which she\r\nnever forgot that the young and graceful are often laid before the old\r\nand weary. She ever kept herself in mind of this, by coming as she did,\r\nto mourn at every funeral. It was not idle curiosity, as some people\r\nmight think. There was her face to read her thoughts in; and where were\r\nthoughts ever written plainer? Let the train behind the coffin be as\r\nlong as it might, there was not a face more serious, there were not any\r\ntears more ready than hers. The very children that used to be sporting\r\nupon the graves at such times, had learned to be quiet without her even\r\nholding up her finger. Who should dig his grave, the old man did not\r\nknow; but he prayed his hour might come when the lady should be at the\r\nhall. She would see him laid under the sod, he was sure; and perhaps, at\r\nthe moment, some things might come into her mind that they had said\r\ntogether at times when things are said that are worth remembering.\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                            ONE FOR HIMSELF.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord and lady F—— found, as all people find, that drawbacks and trials\r\nattend the most exact fulfilment of wishes. Lord F—— had power, was\r\nconscious of usefulness, and was therefore freed from the discontent\r\nwith himself and his position which had tormented him from his college\r\ndays till now; but new trials came with office. Not only toil,\r\nperplexity, and difficulty, but the relinquishment of pursuits which he\r\nloved, and the deprivation of much of his wife’s society. She felt this\r\ndeprivation yet more. It was painful to know that he was in his study,\r\nand to be obliged to spend three-fourths of the day alone; but she had\r\nalso to bear to have him called away suddenly, and to be disappointed of\r\nhis return day after day.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, some weeks after they settled themselves at\r\nWeston,—this happened while their abode was full of guests, among whom\r\nwere the earl and lady Frances. Lord F—— was called to town,—believed he\r\nmight have to go farther,—could not tell how soon he should be able to\r\nreturn. The first two days passed heavily away,—not to the guests, who\r\nenlivened the country round with their outdoor sports, and the rumours\r\nthat went abroad of their indoor revelry,—but to the wife who was far\r\nmore busy watching for Henry’s return than playing the hostess,\r\ngracefully as she filled her office. The happiest part of her day was\r\nwhen shut in with her father-in-law in the library, or reading in her\r\nboudoir, or taking her solitary morning walk when her guests were\r\ndispersed whithersoever their pleasures led them.\r\n\r\nOne day, about noon, having watched for the cessation of a heavy shower,\r\nshe went out with the first returning sunbeams, and took her way towards\r\nthe ruin, with her sketch-book in her hand, as usual. She was quite\r\nalone, this being the hour for Thérèse to go to her priest, and Letitia\r\nnot caring to be attended by any one with whom she could not converse.\r\nThe grass was too wet to allow her to sit down to sketch, and the place\r\ntoo beautiful, glowing in the mellow light of an October noon, to allow\r\nher to wander elsewhere in search of a subject for her pencil. She\r\nseated herself on a stone in a sheltered corner of the ruin, and began,\r\nwhile studying the perspective of an arch, to take notice of the\r\ntrilling of a thrush which was hid among the ivy. As often as the bird\r\nceased, she mimicked its note, to incite it to begin again; and with\r\nsuch success, that the bird and the lady were presently engaged in a\r\nvery noisy and merry duet, answering, following one another,\r\nout-trilling each other, till the nook rang again. In the midst of this,\r\nLetitia suddenly stopped, fancying she saw a slow-moving shadow among\r\nthe ivy at some distance. She sprung up, and looking through the arch,\r\nsaw that some one was leaning on the sun-dial, with his face buried in\r\nhis hands. She retreated, without another look, further into the recess\r\nwhere she had been sitting, believing the stranger more likely to think\r\nhimself unobserved than if she were to show herself in the open space\r\nround the ruin. Hearing no sound of footsteps near, she hoped, after a\r\nfew minutes, that he was gone, and began to draw; but, before long, she\r\nperceived that he was leaning against the wall at some distance, and\r\ngazing fixedly at her. The moment she saw his face, she knew him, though\r\nhe stood within the shadow.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Waldie!” she exclaimed, “what brings you here?”\r\n\r\nHe approached, and sat on the ground at her feet, without answering.\r\n\r\n“What brings you here?” repeated Letitia, in her quietest tone,\r\nperplexed by the expression of his countenance.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, I scarcely know. I can get no rest. I felt I must go somewhere,\r\nso I came here. I thought I should find you; and it was just what I\r\nwished, to meet you without going to the house.”\r\n\r\n“Maria—the children—are they well, or has anything happened?”\r\n\r\n“All well yet: but something will happen soon. Letitia, I am on the\r\nverge of ruin.”\r\n\r\n“I thought as much. Then why are you here? Lord F—— is absent, and I\r\ncannot help you. Away and be doing, Mr. Waldie! Do you quit your home,\r\nand saunter about here, when you are on the verge of ruin? Is this wise?\r\nIs this manly?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot conceive what made me come,” cried Waldie, starting up. “But I\r\nsuppose it was because I was afraid to stay where I was. O Letitia, tell\r\nme what to do, for my head is so confused, I can devise nothing;—go with\r\nme and I will hasten home!”\r\n\r\n“What are your difficulties? What way of escape is there? Tell me all,\r\nor I will advise nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Tell you all! When have I not done so? Do not you——are not you——have\r\nnot you always....”\r\n\r\n“Tell me the whole, brother, as you would tell your wife; or hasten\r\nback, and save her if there be yet time.”\r\n\r\nWith more distinctness than Letitia had hoped, Waldie explained to her\r\nthat he had been engaged in several speculations, all of which, except\r\none, the largest, and still undecided, had turned out badly. Upon this\r\none, everything now depended; and its only chance of success rested upon\r\nseveral thousand pounds being raised within two days. He had bought up\r\nthe whole of certain kinds of India spices which had yet arrived in the\r\nmarket; another cargo, the last of the season, was daily expected to\r\narrive; and upon its purchase depended the price of the commodity, and\r\nthe returns to the capital he had invested in it. This was no time for\r\nreproaching him with the folly of such a speculation, or his weakness in\r\nwandering down into the country, and leaving his fate to be decided by\r\nchance. His credit, he declared, was exhausted; he had no further\r\nsecurities to offer; he did not know which way to turn himself; and so\r\nhe had left the whole affair behind him. “O for lord F——!” thought\r\nLetitia: but she did not even know where he was this day and would be\r\nthe next; and the post which was to tell her would not arrive till the\r\nevening. She suggested all the ways she could think of to raise money;\r\nsome of which were received with a melancholy smile, some with a painful\r\nlaugh. Confused as Waldie seemed to be, he admitted clearly and\r\nrepeatedly that if furnished with securities for the amount required by\r\nnoon the next day, he had great hope of being able to obtain it at more\r\nor less cost. This decided Letitia what to do. She made distinct\r\nmemoranda of the particulars, promising that they should be communicated\r\nto no more than one adviser; she desired Waldie to hasten back to town,\r\nwithout a moment’s delay, in order to commence the negotiation for\r\nfunds, and promised that some one from her should meet him at his office\r\nin town at two o’clock the next day, with the necessary securities, if\r\nthey could be obtained, and with news of failure if they could not. She\r\ndid not tell him that she meant to go herself; but the hope of obtaining\r\nher husband’s assistance, and the conviction that Maria must stand in\r\nneed of her support, determined her to undertake the journey. Having, by\r\ndint of peremptoriness, got rid of Waldie, she walked rapidly towards\r\nthe house, gave her orders to Thérèse to prepare for their journey, and\r\nto the housekeeper to provide for the comfort of her guests during the\r\nthree days of her absence; desired the carriage to take her up at the\r\neast gate in twenty minutes, and proceeded to seek the earl in that part\r\nof the grounds towards which he was seen last to wander. She found him\r\nreading the newspaper in the sun, ready to welcome her as he saw her\r\napproach, but struck silent when he observed the expression of anxiety\r\nin her flushed countenance. She rapidly charged him with her apologies\r\nfor leaving home so suddenly and strangely, and begged to depute her\r\noffice of hostess to lady Frances. She then inquired, to the\r\nastonishment of the earl, how she might best obtain legal advice in a\r\nhurry, if it should be necessary, and whether the earl could put her in\r\nthe way of obtaining securities for the required amount within a few\r\nhours. On her promise to take no step without the advice of her husband\r\nor of the lawyer to whom he would give her an introduction, the earl\r\nfurnished her with some valuable information, wondering all the while\r\nwhat sudden fancy had possessed her; for he had no idea that she could\r\nhave seen any one, or received any letter, since they parted in the\r\nbreakfast-room an hour before.\r\n\r\n“Time was,” said she, while the earl wrote a few lines to his lawyer,\r\n“when I could have raised this money by pledging my own exertions. Now,\r\nnot all my jewels,—not all my resources of every kind will avail me so\r\nwell as three months of my old profession would do. It is well Henry has\r\ngained power; for I have lost much.”\r\n\r\n“Take care you are not tempted to resume it,” replied the earl, smiling.\r\n“You want money, and the way to get it is open. If you are tempted,\r\nremember how it would dismay Henry at his breakfast-table to see the\r\nannouncement of lady F——’s reappearance. Remember that though we talked\r\nof the peerage taking up the profession of the fine arts, that day is\r\nnot come yet;—nor will it have arrived by the time you enter the\r\npeerage, my dear. Which will be home first, you or Henry?”\r\n\r\nLetitia tore a leaf out of her sketch-book, which she still carried, and\r\nwrote a note for her husband in case of his immediate return. The earl\r\ncharged himself with it, as she had no time to go back and seal it; and\r\nputting her arm within his own, led her to the gate where the carriage\r\nwas to meet her. He thought, as she did, that it was best to avoid the\r\nrisk of encountering anybody who might look for an explanation.\r\n\r\n“Farewell, my dear,” said he, as the carriage stopped. “We shall be glad\r\nto see you back again; meanwhile, all success to your measures!”\r\n\r\n“How good you are to trust me for meaning something better than folly,\r\nas I see you do!” said Letitia, with tearful eyes. “This looks so like a\r\nmadcap expedition!”\r\n\r\n“When I have seen you do a foolish thing, my dear, I will believe that\r\nyou may do another. Till then, my faith is strong. Nay, give me a\r\nhappier smile before you go. Has your power ever failed you at need? I\r\ndo not know what you expect from it, but I will venture to predict that\r\nit will not now fail you for the first time.”\r\n\r\nBefore the carriage had well cleared the gate, it stopped again at the\r\nearl’s command. He appeared at the window to say,\r\n\r\n“It never occurred to me to ask whether I can be of use by going with\r\nyou. Say that you wish it, and I am ready, this moment.”\r\n\r\n“You _are_ kind; but I do not wish it:” and again the carriage rolled\r\non.\r\n\r\nWith a beating heart, Letitia made her inquiry at the door of her\r\ntown-house. Lord F—— was not there. He had gone down into the\r\ncountry,—(not to Weston),—that afternoon, leaving a letter to be\r\nforwarded to her, which had been put into the post-office some hours\r\nbefore. Letitia’s best hope was over. It was midnight;—too late to go to\r\nher lawyer. She gave orders to be driven to her sister’s, thinking it\r\nbetter to alarm her a few hours sooner than to risk any loss of time or\r\nof counsel.\r\n\r\nShe carried little new alarm into Maria’s abode. There were lights seen\r\nin the windows, and Maria herself was up and dressed. This was the\r\nsecond night that she had not gone to rest, for it was the second that\r\nWaldie was absent without notice, or any intimation where he might be\r\nfound. The unhappy wife flew to the door on hearing the carriage-wheels.\r\nWhen she saw her sister and Thérèse alone alight, she assumed a forced\r\ncalmness of manner, as if bracing herself up to bear the worst. Letitia\r\njudged it best to use no disguise, from which Maria had suffered all too\r\nmuch already. Inwardly moved by the downcast look of perplexity with\r\nwhich the tidings were received, she told of Waldie’s appearance at\r\nWeston, of his errand,—if errand it might be called,—and intended\r\nreturn. It was some relief to Maria to suppose him engaged in town,\r\nproviding for the approaching crisis, instead of being kept away by any\r\nof the horrible causes which she could not prevent from filling her\r\nimagination by turns.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer, Mr. Bland, was—not much to his content—called away from his\r\nbreakfast and newspaper, the next morning, by the ladies, whom, being\r\nladies, he could not think of keeping in waiting till he had made\r\nhimself master of all the news. Coldly and solemnly he sat himself down\r\nto listen to their affair, and prepared himself with his snuff-box to\r\nget over as well as he could the tedium of hearing a business statement\r\nfrom women. He would have cut the matter short near the beginning, with\r\nthe assurance of the impossibility of raising securities for so large an\r\namount before two o’clock; but Letitia would not be silenced. She showed\r\nthat she understood the case, pointed out the advantage that might\r\naccrue to all parties from the transaction, and indicated such\r\nsatisfactory means of ascertaining whether the speculation could in\r\nreality fail, if the proper funds were provided, that the surly Mr.\r\nBland was won over to promise that he would see what could be done;\r\nwhereupon the ladies immediately left him, promising to return in four\r\nhours, to convey him and his securities to the place where the business\r\nwas to be transacted.\r\n\r\n“Where shall we go?” asked Maria. “What can we do with ourselves for\r\nthese long four hours?”\r\n\r\n“If you have courage to go with me,” replied her sister, “you will find\r\nample employment for the time. If not, we part here, and I advise you to\r\ntake a country drive to refresh yourself. I am going into the depths of\r\nthe city to find up a money-lender, who has proved a very convenient\r\nhelp to certain young gentlemen of lord F——’s acquaintance. One may as\r\nwell try to have two strings to one’s bow, since the worst that can\r\nhappen is to be laughed at, as women are every day when they propose to\r\nmeddle with business.”\r\n\r\n“Is this the worst that can happen?” asked the timid Maria. “Do you\r\nunderstand the law in such matters? I would not have you involved,\r\nLetitia, even to save us.”\r\n\r\n“Trust me for doing nothing that my husband would not have me do,”\r\nreplied Letitia. “Will you come? Our dress tells nothing, does it? It\r\nmight belong to anybody, from a milliner to a maid of honour. Will you\r\ntrust yourself with me?”\r\n\r\nMaria gave herself up to her sister’s guidance. They quitted the\r\ncarriage about half a mile from the house they were in search of.\r\n\r\n“I know the lane,” observed Letitia, “but not the number. We must\r\nventure a guess upon the house. I will make no inquiries.”\r\n\r\nThey walked two or three times along the narrow and dark lane, all the\r\ndwellings of which appeared to Maria equally desolate and unpromising;\r\nbut her sister, who had fixed on one from the beginning, was confirmed\r\nin her opinion by seeing half a pint of blue milk taken in at the front\r\ndoor, while a fruiterer’s boy, carrying a covered basket, through whose\r\nsides might be discerned the richest of grapes, turned into a court\r\nwhich led to the back of the premises.\r\n\r\n“Blue milk in public for the serving man’s breakfast,” said Letitia,\r\n“and purple grapes in private for the master’s luncheon. This suits the\r\nman exactly. This must be the place.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, she walked up as the milkman made way, and asked for Mr.\r\nSimeon. The wizened, sly-looking old serving-man replied that Mr. Simeon\r\nwas engaged on business. Perhaps the ladies had mistaken this place for\r\nthe shop in —— street. Only the wholesale jewellery business was carried\r\non here. No; they wanted Mr. Simeon, and would wait till he was at\r\nliberty. After several messages backwards and forwards, the ladies were\r\nbeckoned in, with apologies for the parlour not being at liberty. A\r\ndingy wareroom having been passed, it was next required of them to mount\r\na sort of ladder into what they supposed would prove a loft, but was in\r\nreality a counting-house, so dark that it appeared questionable whether\r\nany business could be carried on at any hour of any season without\r\nlamps. Maria would have sunk down on the first chair, if chair there had\r\nbeen: and in the absence of any, was fain to perch herself on the high\r\nstool, which afforded little rest for want of a footstool. Letitia, who\r\nwas always conscious of inward enjoyment when in strange scenes and\r\ncircumstances, peered round in the gloom to make her observations. It\r\nwas well that she kept to herself her remarks on chests and padlocks, on\r\nthe flask which stood on a corner shelf, and on the bareness of the\r\nwhole place, which left nothing but the said flask which could be\r\ncarried away: it was well that she made no audible remarks on these\r\nthings, as some one was present before either she or her sister was\r\naware. Mr. Simeon had entered by an unseen door, and his compliments to\r\nthe ladies were the first intimation of his presence. She observed a\r\nmanœuvre to get them placed opposite the little light there was, and\r\ndisappointed it; being disposed to reconnoitre the person with whom she\r\nwas about to deal. She was surprised to find him a well-made,\r\nmiddle-aged man, whose countenance, as far as she could see,\r\ncorresponded with his address, which was mild and courteous. She\r\nexplained, without delay, that her business was to ascertain on what\r\nterms so many thousand pounds could be borrowed for a month.\r\n\r\nOn no terms which were not sanctioned by the law of the realm. Perhaps\r\nthe ladies were aware of the law?\r\n\r\nLetitia replied that the same terms might suit the present case as had\r\nbeen agreed upon by Mr. Simeon for loans of five, ten, and forty\r\nthousand pounds, at such, and such and such dates.\r\n\r\nThis proof of some knowledge of his transactions caused the money-lender\r\nto pause and attentively consider his guests; after which he observed,\r\nas if half to himself, that debts of honour were troublesome things, and\r\nespecially to ladies, to whom ways and means were less open than to\r\ngentlemen. Letitia supposed that Mr. Simeon knew best, from the nature\r\nof his business; but she had believed that gaming was obsolete among\r\nladies. She knew no ladies who were addicted to play. Simeon’s further\r\nremarks glanced upon unpaid jewellery, the flight of Chancery-wards to\r\nthe continent, and divers other suppositions, all of which were baffled\r\nby one or other sister, who did not choose to allow occasion for any\r\nscandal against themselves, in case of the present transaction becoming\r\nknown. Letitia cut the investigation short by requesting to look at the\r\nstatute which regulates the rate of interest on monies lent, and which\r\nshe concluded to be in the possession of a money-lender. It was brought,\r\nand with it a taper, by whose light Mr. Simeon was enabled to perplex\r\nhimself still further about the quality of his fair visitors.\r\n\r\n“It is an unjust law, madam, a cruel law, worthy only of the Mahomedans,\r\nwho call it a sin to lend monies on interest; but it is the law....”\r\n\r\n“And must therefore be obeyed, Mr. Simeon. The forfeit—‘the treble value\r\nof the monies, or other things, so lent, bargained, &c.’—I wonder they\r\ndo not ordain the treble value of silks and sugars to be forfeited when\r\nthe price rises. As well one commodity as another.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, madam, that would raise the prices unconscionably. People must have\r\ncommodities; and if they cannot get them by a straight-forward course,\r\nthey must have their little plans and managements. There is risk and\r\ntrouble in such plans; and for this the planners must be paid. So much\r\nbeing added, the prices would rise unconscionably.”\r\n\r\n“That is to say, sir, that we are to pay you unconscionably, if you can\r\nmake a little plan to furnish us with this money. Let us hear your\r\nterms, supposing we can furnish you with unquestionable security.”\r\n\r\nMr. Simeon seemed disposed, however, to descant a little longer on the\r\nhardship of the law, which not only, he observed, obliged him to be wary\r\nand even apparently rigid in his proceedings,—not only was a perpetual\r\nand most injurious hinderance in the way of commerce,—not only showed\r\nthat the makers of the statute did not understand the office of a\r\ncirculating medium,—not only brought the holy law of Moses (by which the\r\ntaking of interest was falsely supposed to be forbidden) into\r\ncontempt,—but had actually brought two charming ladies from their native\r\nregions of refinement into a dark hole quite unworthy of their presence!\r\nHe was recalled to business, and obliged to state the rate of interest\r\nhe would receive through one of the circuitous and safe methods which\r\nnecessity has invented. He was not sufficiently aware with whom he had\r\nto deal.\r\n\r\n“Your terms, Mr. Simeon, would suit a time when money is scarce; whereas\r\nyou know as well as I that it is plentiful, and that the rate of profit\r\nhas not for many years been so low as at present.”\r\n\r\nMr. Simeon endeavoured to mystify her by pointing out that the kind of\r\nprofit in question had nothing to do with other profits, the lending of\r\nmoney being an unique case. It would not do.\r\n\r\n“Consider interest in what light you will, sir, it comes to this.\r\nInterest is the nett profit on capital, and that nett profit cannot but\r\nbe low in the present state of the market. There is a money-lending\r\nmarket, as you well know, though your department of it is\r\ndiscountenanced; and we are not in such a hurry but we can walk through\r\nit and learn what terms some of your neighbours have to offer. Our\r\nobject is gained in finding that you can advance what is wanted.”\r\n\r\nMr. Simeon shook his head, and observed that the securities were not yet\r\nbefore him, that he had entered into large engagements already this\r\nmorning, and that there were sundry other difficulties in the way of a\r\nconclusion of the bargain. To which the ladies replied that both parties\r\nhad better take time to consider; and that a messenger should wait on\r\nMr. Simeon at three o’clock to put an end to the treaty, or conduct him\r\nto the place where the securities would be waiting for him. To this the\r\nman of money agreed, only requesting to appoint a later hour, on account\r\nof prior engagements.\r\n\r\nThe ladies were urged to refresh themselves with some rare foreign wine,\r\nto accept an escort home, and to do or permit many other things which\r\nmight afford a chance of their revealing themselves: but in vain.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the place, Maria proposed making a circuit to join the\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\n“Why?” asked her sister. “We have done nothing to be ashamed of.”\r\n\r\n“Why then conceal your name?”\r\n\r\n“Simply because it had nothing to do with the business, our errand being\r\nmerely exploratory; and it might have altered the terms in a way\r\ninjurious to your husband. Now that our errand is done, let them follow\r\nus and see who we are, if they like.”\r\n\r\n“But the errand itself!”\r\n\r\n“Is anything but a pleasant one, certainly; but my conscience is at ease\r\nas to my share of it. We keep the letter of the statute, you know, and\r\nthat is enough. No one is bound to keep the spirit of a bad law, since\r\nevasion is the only means of bringing on its repeal. As for the usury\r\nlaws,—they have been repeatedly condemned by committees of the\r\nlegislature; and the more they are evaded, the better is the chance of\r\ngetting rid of them. Do not you see this? Do not you see that perpetual\r\nevasion of any law is a sufficient proof of its badness?”\r\n\r\n“You have such courage!” exclaimed Maria. “All I wish for is to get\r\nthrough life as quietly as I can, and bring up my children to do the\r\nsame.”\r\n\r\n“Beware of teaching them _blind_ obedience, Maria,” said Letitia, when\r\nonce more seated in the carriage; “your girls equally with your son.\r\nObedience, by all means; but a rational, discriminating, and therefore\r\nloving and hearty obedience to the public laws as well as to those of\r\nyour own house. Your little ones will learn hereafter that your object\r\nin forbidding them to set foot on the hearth-rug in your absence, is to\r\nguard them from being burned. Let them learn at the same future time the\r\npurposes of the laws under which they live, that they may be ready to do\r\ntheir part in that renovation of the system which is required as years\r\nroll on. If you would not have your children retain a superstitious\r\ndread of a hearth-rug through life, neither would you have them cling to\r\nlaws enacted in the infancy of the state, and inappropriate to its\r\npresent condition.”\r\n\r\n“Implicit obedience is at least safe,” observed Maria.\r\n\r\n“Safe to a certain point, but no farther. If you continue the law of the\r\nhearth-rug for twenty years to come, your obedient children will never\r\nbe burned by crossing it; but do you suppose they will not by that time\r\nhave discovered other means of getting the warmth they wish for? They\r\nwill creep under it; they will creep round it; they will jump over it.\r\nSo is it, and so should it be with absurd, antiquated laws.”\r\n\r\n“Who is to judge which are absurd and which sound?”\r\n\r\n“The bulk of the subjects of them. A sound law can never be evaded by\r\nmore than a solitary simpleton here and there, against whom society will\r\nrise up; since it is the paramount interest of society to keep good laws\r\nin effectual operation. When the time comes for the bulk of society to\r\napprove and enforce the usury laws, you and I will pay no more visits to\r\nMr. Simeon. Till then, or till their repeal, let there be opposition to\r\nthe spirit and grudging obedience to the letter, unless we are prepared\r\nfor the consequences of a breach of both.”\r\n\r\n“Not I, nor, I hope, anybody belonging to me,” replied Maria. “O,\r\nLetitia, what o’clock is it? I cannot trust my watch.”\r\n\r\n“Far enough from two o’clock, my dear. So you will not be amused, even\r\nwith talk about the usury laws. Well? I will keep all drowsy subjects to\r\nlull you to sleep with to-night, when all will be settled;—all redeemed,\r\nI trust; and when you will own at last that watching has nearly worn you\r\nout.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bland looked as immitigably solemn as ever, when he appeared at his\r\nown door on the carriage stopping. He would have had the ladies wait the\r\nresult at his house; but Letitia’s business was not finished till she\r\nhad ascertained whether Simeon’s help would be wanted or not. Mr. Bland\r\nwas obliged to let his law papers be tossed into her lap, and to edge in\r\nhis stick and portly person as well as he could. He had been busy since\r\nthe morning interview, and had fully satisfied himself in the matter of\r\nthe spices; but he said to himself, while being whirled along, that the\r\naffair could hardly be brought to a satisfactory conclusion, since a\r\nwoman had so much to do in it. If it had not been for the Earl’s\r\nrecommendation of the case, he would have eschewed the whole matter; and\r\nthe oddest thing was that his lordship did not say whether he was\r\nhimself informed of the particulars.\r\n\r\n“Is Mr. Waldie here?” inquired the trembling wife, in a choking voice,\r\nof one of the clerks, who appeared when the carriage stopped.\r\n\r\n“He is, madam; but particularly engaged at present, except——”\r\n\r\n“Except to this gentleman,” said Letitia, handing Mr. Bland’s card with\r\nher own, which brought an immediate request that the party would alight.\r\n\r\nMr. Waldie was in the act of shutting somebody into an inner room when\r\nhis wife appeared at the door. He looked pale and worn, but composed and\r\nactive. He received his wife and her sister as if nothing extraordinary\r\nhad happened, stated that the money would be forthcoming if the\r\nsecurities were so; and went straight to business with Mr. Bland.\r\n\r\nAs soon as satisfied that all was likely to be well, the ladies proposed\r\nto withdraw into the inner room, and await the issue.\r\n\r\n“That room? No; not there, my dear,” said he. “Yet you will not mind my\r\nother man of business being there. He will not be in your way long.”\r\n\r\nSo they were ushered into the apartment where stood—Mr. Simeon.\r\n\r\n“You will be saved the trouble of another excursion at four o’clock, Mr.\r\nSimeon,” observed Letitia. “We have only to regret having consumed some\r\nof your time already this day. You will hardly see us again till we have\r\ndebts of honour to pay, or a Chancery elopement to provide for.”\r\n\r\nMr. Simeon considered himself a gainer by the transaction in proportion\r\nto the honour his poor counting-house had enjoyed; an honour the more\r\nprecious for its being confined within his own breast. He knew his duty\r\ntoo well to reveal what had passed.\r\n\r\n“Do as you please about that,” replied Letitia. “You and Mr. Waldie must\r\nagree about your keeping Mr. Waldie’s secrets; but, for my part, I have\r\nnone. You owe neither honour nor duty to me, aware, as you no doubt are,\r\nthat I did not come to borrow money on my own account.”\r\n\r\nMr. Simeon merely mentioned the temptation of talking about the affair,\r\nbecause it was really an extraordinary case. Not that it was a rare\r\nthing for ladies to want money; but that they usually employed agents to\r\nprocure it. How indeed should it be otherwise? since not one woman in\r\nfive thousand understood even the forms of business; and these solitary\r\nexceptions were in a class which had no dealings with moneylenders. On\r\nthis, followed a series of narratives of fair ones’ difficulties for\r\nwant of cash, which amused Letitia exceedingly, from the romance of\r\nadventure which was mixed up with the most sordid borrowing\r\ntransactions. The heroines were only A. B. and C.; but they became real\r\npersonages in Letitia’s imagination on the instant; and she was almost\r\nsorry when Mr. Simeon was called into the next room to review his\r\nsecurities and perform his promises.\r\n\r\nIt seemed an age before Mr. Waldie threw open the door, announcing that\r\nall was well. He briefly thanked Letitia for having saved him; urged\r\nthem to return home and rest from their anxieties; and was only sorry\r\nthat he could not accompany them, or even promise to follow them for\r\nsome days, as he should be incessantly occupied till the expected cargo\r\nwas secured. He perceived that his wife’s countenance fell on hearing\r\nthis, and rallied her; asking what there was now left to be afraid\r\nof?—She did not know, but——\r\n\r\n“She is worn out,” said Letitia. “I will take care that she shall\r\nrecruit herself, and wait patiently, unless you try her too long.—You\r\nmay be quite easy,” she continued to her sister, when Waldie’s last\r\ngrave smile dismissed them. “All is safe, with him as well as with his\r\naffairs. How calm he is! How entirely himself! He will speculate no\r\nmore, believe me.”\r\n\r\nMaria shook her head, as her tears fell fast. It was not only that her\r\nnerves and spirits were shaken by what she had gone through. Her\r\nconfidence was utterly overthrown, and she felt the present relief to be\r\nno more than a respite.\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                             CONSEQUENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who had educated Waldie were partly answerable for his propensity\r\nto speculation, which arose more from a restless ambition than from a\r\ndesire of overgrown wealth. The foundation of the fortunes of his family\r\nwas laid by an ancestor who, a few hundred years ago, introduced a new\r\nmanufacture, which he had learned abroad, into this country. Though,\r\nfrom having to take workmen away from other manufactures, and to engage\r\nthem to learn his own, he gave higher wages than any of his neighbours,\r\nhis profits were also very great, as his article bore a high price in\r\nthe market, in the way that new articles of convenient manufacture\r\ngenerally do. If profits may be said (as they are by some said) to be as\r\nmuch the reward of labour as wages,—that is, the reward of present\r\nsuperintendence, and of the labour out of which arose the capital\r\nemployed, it is certain that this first rich member of the Waldie family\r\nreaped as large a proportionate reward as his workmen; for long after\r\ntheir wages and his profits were lowered by his silk stuffs becoming\r\nmore common, and the difficulty of getting workmen being less, he\r\ncontinued to grow rich from his having more capital to employ in\r\nbringing him profits. If every hundred pounds did not produce\r\nseventy-five, he had, in course of time, for every such hundred, five\r\nthat brought 50 per cent., and afterwards fifteen that brought 25 per\r\ncent.; so that he continued to grow rich, just as individuals and\r\ncountries may in these days, if accumulation proceeds faster than\r\nprofits fall. His descendants for some generations carried on this\r\nmanufacture, for which there was a permanent demand, and so steady a one\r\nthat the variations in its price arose only from the variations in the\r\nprices of other things, and not from changes of fashion. Now and then\r\nthe price of provisions fell, which enabled these manufacturers to lower\r\ntheir men’s wages, and enjoy larger profits, till the time came for\r\nprofits to fall also; and sometimes the reverse happened, when the price\r\nof provisions rose. Sometimes complaints were made against the largeness\r\nof their profits, when the fact was that they gave precisely the same\r\nproportion of their produce to their workmen as before, but there were\r\nmore workmen to divide this proportion; which was no fault of their\r\nmasters. With these few variations, the family continued to prosper,\r\nbeing for the most part content with the ordinary rate of profits, and\r\nmaking up by continual accumulation for their gradual fall;—that fall\r\nwhich must take place wherever the supply of food is restricted. They\r\nwere all proud of the ancestor who had founded the wealth of their\r\nfamily, and sent his praises down from generation to generation. The\r\npresent Mr. Waldie had been early accustomed to listen to them, and\r\nimpressed with the idea that it was time for somebody else to be adding\r\nglory to the family, as it had become much less distinguished in these\r\ntimes of improvements than in the first days of its wealth. He quitted\r\nthe manufacture, and became a merchant, thinking that this occupation\r\nwould afford better opportunities for the gratification of his ambition\r\nthan the straightforward old manufacture. No wonder he was tempted by\r\nschemes which promised a higher than extraordinary rate of profits! No\r\nwonder he dealt in articles whose extremely varying prices were\r\ndetermined by other than the usual circumstances,—which prices he hoped\r\nto catch at the highest, and then to have done with the article! No\r\nwonder that he guessed respecting such uncertain circumstances as the\r\nchanges of fashion, wet and dry seasons, the extent of particular crops\r\non the other side the globe; and then proceeded to act upon these\r\nguesses! Sometimes he was right, sometimes wrong. Sometimes he made five\r\nthousand pounds at a stroke, sometimes lost ten in a season. Much as his\r\ncapital was lessened on the whole by his speculations, this was by no\r\nmeans the worst result of his proceedings. Like all other gamesters, he\r\nbecame so fond of the excitement, that, much as he often suffered from\r\nit, he could no longer live without it; and the domestic influence which\r\nis the most powerful means of winning a man from bad habits of any kind,\r\nwas not so powerful in Waldie’s case as if his first affections had not\r\nbeen disappointed. Attentive as he always was to his wife when with her,\r\nkind as he had till lately been to his children, vehement as were the\r\nfancies he took, now to Portugal laurels, now to tall trees, now to\r\nbay-windows or new drawing-room furniture, his happiness was not in his\r\nhome, but in the heats and chills of his hopes, in city news of\r\ndisasters at sea, of changeable weather, of new inventions or\r\nimprovements of manufactured articles, and of political changes,—of\r\nanything that might affect his speculations. His poor wife knew nothing\r\nfor a long while of his unfortunate ventures, though she heard enough of\r\nexultation over his good ones. She believed that he must be growing\r\nenormously rich, and sighed over the idea, since it seemed that the\r\nricher he became, the less pleasure he took in his home. When he first\r\nbegan to alter his tone, (which he did very suddenly,) when he talked\r\none day of bringing up their children to provide for themselves, and\r\nmoving into a small house in the city, and the next of purchasing some\r\nsplendid estate, and again of giving up his carriages and sending away\r\nhalf his servants, she was confounded; not knowing how much to believe,\r\nor to wish to believe; whether to suppose poverty to be in prospect, or\r\nher husband to have lost the soundness of his judgment. It was now some\r\ncomfort to know how their affairs stood, though she would rather have\r\nheard it from her husband than from Letitia. She had long seen that\r\nWaldie’s family ambition could not be gratified. Whichever way the scale\r\nmight turn at last, whether he left his family in poverty or\r\nmagnificence, it was impossible that his memory should be honoured like\r\nthat of the ancestor who had prospered by uniting prudence and industry\r\nwith his zeal of enterprise. Whether all was to be swallowed up in\r\nKentish hops and Russian tallow, or all redeemed and even doubled by\r\nIndia spices, those of Waldie’s descendants who knew his history, would,\r\nin either case, pity or despise him as a gambler.—How much of pity his\r\nfate would call for, not even the most alarmed imaginations of his timid\r\nwife had fully conceived. She had fancied him, over and over again, in\r\ngaol, in poverty; the idea of suicide even had flashed across her mind;\r\nbut that which actually happened took her more by surprise than arrest,\r\nor ruin, or death by his own hand.\r\n\r\nTwo anxious days were passed by the sisters in expectation of the\r\ndecision of Waldie’s affairs, and still he did not appear. Notes came\r\ntwo or three times a day from himself or from his clerk, who wrote at\r\nhis desire, requesting Mrs. Waldie not to leave home, as her husband did\r\nnot know how soon he might be with her, to take a few days’ repose on\r\nthe conclusion of his business. Letitia heard from her husband also on\r\nhis arrival at home, and from the earl, both desiring her not to leave\r\nher sister till she could do so with comfort; which, in Letitia’s mind,\r\nmeant till Waldie should have come home. On the third morning arrived\r\nthis extraordinary note.\r\n\r\n“My own dearest Maria” (substituted for “Letitia,” scratched out)\r\n\r\nComing, coming, coming, as rich as Crœsus! Light the bonfire. Ring the\r\nbells. Hurrah! Spices for ever! Coming, coming, coming!\r\n\r\n                                                              F. W.”\r\n\r\n“I do wish Waldie would control his spirits a little,” said Maria,\r\nshowing the note to her sister, and then looking as if she would fain\r\nhave withdrawn it. “How can he bring himself to write in such a way?”\r\n\r\nLetitia had nothing to say at the moment; not even congratulations on\r\nthe wealth of Crœsus having crowned all these vicissitudes. She asked\r\nfor the children. They were gone out with Thérèse and their own\r\nnurse-maid. She offered a turn in the shrubbery; but Maria was not, she\r\npresently saw, strong enough to walk. She threw open the bay-windows,\r\nand beckoned her sister to come and be refreshed by the feel of the mild\r\nautumn air, the bloom of the autumn roses, and the tranquil beauty of\r\nthe green prospect. There they sat, watching and working, letting drop a\r\nfew words now and then, but keeping up nothing like conversation, and\r\nlooking out as often as a horseman might be seen through the trees, or a\r\ncarriage heard in the road. At last, the sound of a horse’s hoofs\r\nreached them, far too rapid for safety, they were sure; and immediately\r\nWaldie was seen on horseback, approaching at tremendous speed, with\r\nsomething white before him, which proved to be his two elder children.\r\n\r\n“Mercy! Mercy!” cried his wife, putting her hands before her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Thank God! the gate is open. They are in! Safe!” exclaimed Letitia, as\r\nthe horseman wheeled round the corner and up to the window, checking his\r\nsteed so suddenly as to throw it on its haunches, setting the pebbles\r\nflying in all directions, and mingling his loud hurrah with the laughter\r\nof the younger child, who saw nothing but fun in all this. The elder one\r\nwas convulsed with terror.\r\n\r\nIt was well some one was on the spot; for Waldie threw down both the\r\nchildren as if they had been mere bundles of clothes. They were\r\ncaught,—not, however, without so much slight bruising as called forth\r\ntheir cries to add to the confusion.\r\n\r\n“O Waldie,” shrieked his wife, “what are you about?”\r\n\r\n“Look, look, look!” he cried, flourishing his whip over his head,\r\nclapping spurs to his horse, and trampling the beds, walks, and lawn\r\nalike, and finishing by making his horse leap high and still higher\r\nshrubs. He finished by fixing his eye upon the greenhouse, as if he\r\ncontemplated a leap there too.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Waldie,” said Letitia, in her steadiest tone, “what are you doing?”\r\n\r\nIn a moment he was off, had flung the bridle on the neck of the sweating\r\nand trembling horse, and was by her side, swearing deep oaths that she\r\nhad ever governed his life and ever should govern it. With her in\r\nwealth, as with her in poverty, he would....\r\n\r\nMaria had rushed into the house upon this, but not the less did Letitia\r\nby eye, and gesture, and word, command him from her, and prevail for the\r\nmoment. He obeyed when she pointed his way into the house, and she was\r\nstill standing, faint in body and spirit, with the poor children\r\nclinging to her, when Thérèse came in from the road, breathless, and\r\nsinking with terror. When she saw the children safe, she burst into\r\ntears: she had feared that she might have to answer for their lives,\r\nfrom not having had presence of mind to evade Waldie’s vehement desire\r\nthat the children should have a ride.—Her mistress gave her a few\r\ndirections, which she hastened into the house to execute, and Letitia,\r\nafter giving the servants a charge to take the children into the nursery\r\nand keep them there, repaired to her sister. She found Maria lying\r\nacross the bed, groaning in heart-breaking grief.\r\n\r\n“Sister!” said she, gently, after watching silently beside her for a few\r\nmoments—“Sister, your husband wants you. He is ill, fearfully ill; and\r\nwho should tend him but you?—Nay; why this despair? A brain fever ...\r\nall may be well....”\r\n\r\n“Letitia; do not deceive me. It is mockery to attempt it.”\r\n\r\n“Maria, if I wished to deceive you, I dare not. What I have done will\r\nprove this. Thérèse is packing up, and I am going in half an hour. It\r\ngrieves me to leave you; but I must go.”\r\n\r\n“O yes, yes; you must go.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment, there was a tremendous knocking at the room door, which\r\nwas luckily fastened. It was Waldie, still calling upon Letitia, who\r\nwould not answer. Maria dared not. The knocking went on till there\r\nseemed some probability of the door giving way, when, perhaps from\r\nhaving his attention diverted by the servants, the madman quitted his\r\nobject, and ran down stairs.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes: you must go,” repeated Maria, bitterly.\r\n\r\nLetitia could forgive the tone in which this was spoken.\r\n\r\n“Listen, Maria, what you must do. Command yourself, and go and tell the\r\nbutler that his master has a brain-fever, and desire him not to quit\r\nyour husband’s side but at your bidding. Have the children kept away,\r\nand, if possible, stay with your husband, looking and speaking like\r\nyourself, till some one comes to relieve you of your charge. I will\r\nimmediately send proper advice and help from town.—Farewell, sister. I\r\nshall not come again till you send for me. As soon as I can be of any\r\ncomfort, send. My husband will wish it.”\r\n\r\n“But Waldie will insist on going with you. He will never let you drive\r\noff. He will....”\r\n\r\n“All this is provided against. I can plead an errand near the turnpike,\r\nand shall go out with Thérèse by the little shrubbery gate. The carriage\r\nwill overtake us. Do not detain me. Farewell.”\r\n\r\nLetitia said nothing about removing the children. She thought that if,\r\nas was probable, Waldie’s state should prove such as to render Maria’s\r\npresence improper, her children would be her best comfort.—In a few\r\nminutes, Maria saw, but diverted her husband from seeing, Letitia and\r\nThérèse hastening from the back of the house through the shrubbery, and\r\ndisappearing down the road. It was with a strange mixture of bitter and\r\nyearning feelings that the unhappy wife witnessed such a conclusion as\r\nthis of a visit which had been planned and endured for her sake.\r\n\r\nThere was ample time in after years for the sisters to explain, and\r\nforgive, and renew the confidence which had been unshaken till this day.\r\nWaldie was never more an impediment to their intercourse. He was kept\r\nunder close restraint from the hour after Letitia’s departure, when he\r\ninsisted on searching every corner of the house for her, and was frantic\r\nat having sought in vain, up to the moment when, after years, first of\r\nmadness and then of imbecility, death released himself and his friends\r\nfrom the burden of his existence.\r\n\r\nMore than once Maria tremblingly asked the confidential physician\r\nwhether her sister’s presence was likely to be of any service; and\r\nalmost rejoiced to be answered with a decided negative.\r\n\r\nIt was perfectly true that Waldie had become, as is commonly said, as\r\nrich as Crœsus. But what to Maria was all the splendour in which she\r\nmight have henceforth lived, if she had so chosen? What to her was the\r\ntrebling of the fortunes of her children? As a compensation for the love\r\nwhich had been disappointed, the domestic hopes which had been rudely\r\noverthrown, these things were nothing, though there were some in the\r\nworld who called them prosperity.\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                             EACH FOR ALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nLady F—— remained a few hours in London to learn the physician’s opinion\r\nof Waldie’s state, and to give notice at home of her approach. She had\r\nno rest, in town or on the road, from the visions which haunted her of\r\nwhat she had lately seen. Waldie’s countenance of fierce glee was for\r\never before her; his raised voice startled her imagination perpetually.\r\nShe had no repose till her husband met her some miles from Weston,\r\nsuffered her to alight at the park-gates, and invited her to wander with\r\nhim to the ruin, and through the autumnal woods, to her beloved seat\r\nbeside the stream that fed the lake. Refreshed and composed, she joined\r\nher guests at the dinner table, and was warmly welcomed back again: not\r\nthe less so for no one but the earl and lady Frances having an idea what\r\nhad caused her absence. All were ready with that delicate homage which\r\nmay be supposed to have been as gratifying in its way to Letitia as it\r\nis to many who relish a grosser flattery than she would ever endure. All\r\nwere ready with tidings of her protegés, from pheasants to men and\r\nwomen. One could assure her that a very favourite plant had not suffered\r\nfrom the frosts of the night after she left Weston. Another had tasted\r\nthe cream of her dairy; a third admired her bantams; a fourth amused\r\nhimself with Nanny White; a fifth conversed with the old sexton; and\r\nlady Frances herself condescended to hope that that good girl, Thérèse,\r\nhad not been left behind in London. She was such a treasure! Thereby\r\nhung a confession, afterwards given in private, that Philips was really\r\nvery much spoiled, and becoming a great trouble. Her manners were\r\nanything but improved, to say nothing of her temper. Miss Falconbridge,\r\nwhom she knew to be as intimate as a sister with lady Frances, had taken\r\na fancy to lady Frances’s style of hair; and as the easiest way of\r\ngratifying her, lady Frances had ordered Philips to dress Miss\r\nFalconbridge’s hair the day before; whereupon Philips sent word through\r\nMiss Falconbridge’s maid that she must beg to decline the honour! Lady\r\nFrances had insisted, and her maid in some sort obeyed: but never was\r\nanything seen so absurd as the young lady’s head. What was lady Frances\r\nto do? To part with Philips was altogether impossible; and to bear with\r\nher now was scarcely less so. Letitia could not answer for what she\r\nshould do if compelled to retain such a person as Philips: she could\r\nonly appeal to her own management of Thérèse as a proof of how easy a\r\nmatter it is to make a valuable friend out of a hired attendant.\r\n\r\n“O yes! by taking the trouble of educating her, no doubt. But that is a\r\ntask I could not submit to. That reminds me—how does Thérèse get on with\r\npolitics? I remember her one day, so eloquent about the revolution her\r\nfather remembers, and the prospect of another revolution, and the glory\r\nof having seen Lafayette.”\r\n\r\n“She knows more than she would probably have learned in the very heart\r\nof Paris. She has left off assuring me that all the kings of France have\r\nbeen royalists.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose it is for the sake of keeping her innocent of some things\r\nwhich lady’s maids learn soon enough that you let her read and talk\r\npolitics as she does?”\r\n\r\n“Partly; and partly with a more direct view to my own interest. It will\r\nbe of very great consequence to me that she should be, not only pure in\r\nher conduct, but well educated up to as high a point as I can carry\r\nher.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! you mean for the sake of your little heir. I see Thérèse is as busy\r\nabout the preparations as if she had taken her office upon her already.\r\nBut you began your care of Thérèse from the day you knew her, she tells\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“I did; and so I should do still, if there were no heir in prospect.\r\nShould I be justified, think you, in placing any one where I myself\r\norder the circumstances which are to form her character, and at the same\r\ntime neglecting to order those circumstances well?—It is perfectly true\r\nthat, in engaging servants, we undertake a great task. In the case of\r\nThérèse, however, the task has been all pleasure.”\r\n\r\n“Well, for your reward, I suppose you will keep her always. You will not\r\nlet her marry, I conclude; or, if she marries, will insist on her\r\nremaining with you. It would be too hard to lose all your pains.”\r\n\r\n“Whenever Thérèse loves,—and I think I can trust her to commit no folly\r\nwith that sound heart of hers,—she shall marry; and she shall enter upon\r\nher new state as I entered upon mine, with the view of being all and\r\ndoing all for society of which that state admits. This may best be done\r\nby being wholly her husband’s, and a fixture in his home. I shall\r\nsurrender my part in her on her marriage day.”\r\n\r\n“By which, I suppose, you hope to retain at least half her heart, if\r\nnone of her services. But, my dear, what a prospect for you!”\r\n\r\n“A goodly prospect indeed, either way. Either a friend at hand, and a\r\nfit guardian of my children in my absence; or a successful experiment in\r\nhappiness-making, ever before my eyes. I hope ever to rejoice in\r\nThérèse.”\r\n\r\nLady Frances sighed, and began to ponder whether, even if she could\r\nlearn to live without Philips, she could make to herself a maid in whom\r\nshe might rejoice.\r\n\r\nNot only from her husband did Letitia learn how welcome she was back to\r\nWeston. The days of her absence had passed like other days, when people\r\nwho prefer the town, and whose lives are formed for that destination,\r\nare thrown together in the country. There were means of enjoyment in\r\nabundance; but not of a kind to be permanently relished by those before\r\nwhom they lay. Letitia’s music was wanted in the evenings; Letitia’s\r\nconversation, artless and sprightly as a girl’s, rich as a matured\r\nwoman’s, and entertaining enough to suit everybody, was sighed for at\r\ntable, and when it rained, and especially when the ladies were called\r\nupon to amuse each other in the absence of the gentlemen. It was only on\r\nrare occasions, however, that she relinquished her privilege of\r\nreserving several hours of the morning for herself and her husband. On\r\none desperately rainy day, she was found ready for chess or music before\r\ndinner; and at another time, when all the gentlemen were absent for the\r\nwhole day at a political meeting in the neighbouring city, she did not\r\nleave her guests at all. But these occasions were rare. On the\r\nlast-mentioned one, she had some view to her own interest as well as\r\nthat of her guests. Lord F—— meant to speak at the meeting; his speech\r\nmust, from his office, be one of the most important of the day; and he\r\nwas doubtful both how he should acquit himself, and how that which he\r\nhad to say would be received. Letitia was, of course, far from being at\r\nease, and was glad to conceal, and to carry off some of her anxiety at\r\nthe same time by being “on hospitable thoughts intent.” It was the last\r\nday of the last of her visiters; the gentlemen having waited only for\r\nthis meeting. Their carriages were ordered for the next morning, and\r\nthey did not return till late at night.\r\n\r\nThey were nearly as eloquent in describing the effect of lord F——’s\r\nspeech, as, by their account, had been the speech itself.—One swore by\r\nhis soul that it was the most good-natured sort of thing he had ever\r\nheard in his life: another, that the government and the government\r\ncandidate ought to feel themselves much obliged to him; another, that\r\nlord F——’s constituents would be more proud of him than ever; another,\r\nan M.P., a representative of the commercial interest, that lord F—— had\r\nenlightened the people not a little on the question when low profits\r\nwere harmless, and when bad things, and why; and all, with the earl\r\namong them, that this day might prove the beginning of a new era in lord\r\nF——’s public life. He would now have as potent a voice out of the house\r\nas his friends had ever hoped he would in time have in it.\r\n\r\n“How happens all this, Henry?” asked Letitia, aside, with a glowing\r\nsmile. “You gave me no expectation of anything like this.”\r\n\r\n“Because I had none myself. The charm lay in the burden which I adopted\r\nfrom our neighbours down in the village;—‘for each and for all.’”\r\n\r\n“I see; I understand. Now leave the rest till you can give it me all in\r\norder.”\r\n\r\nIt was accordingly given, all in order, when the last carriage had\r\ndriven off, the next morning, and Henry and Letitia shut themselves into\r\nthe library, to enjoy the uninterruptedness of the first fall of snow.\r\nThis was no day for the approach of deputations, for the visits of\r\nclergyman, lawyer, lady callers, gentleman loungers, or even petitioners\r\nfrom the village. The guests had been urged to stay for finer weather;\r\nbut, as peremptory in their plans as people of real business, provided\r\nchange of place is the object, they could on no account delay an hour;\r\nand, to be sure, the snow signified little to any but the postilions and\r\nthe horses.\r\n\r\n“Well, now, the speech, the speech!” cried Letitia.\r\n\r\n“I told the people that nobody doubts that changes are wanted, in order\r\nto remedy the evils so large a portion of society is justly complaining\r\nof; and that the thing needed is a wider agreement as to what those\r\nchanges must be, and therefore a sounder and more general knowledge of\r\nthe causes of existing evils. I led them, as an instance, into the\r\nconsideration of the common complaint of low profits and low wages, and\r\nshowed them, I hope, that proportional wages are much higher at present\r\nthan some complainers suppose; the fact being lost sight of from the\r\nenormous increase of those among whom the wages-fund is divided. However\r\nlittle each labourer may, from this cause, obtain for his own share, the\r\ndivision of produce between capitalist and labourer,—that is, the\r\nproportion of profits and wages, is more equable than is supposed by\r\ncapitalists who complain of their low profits, and labourers of their\r\nlow wages. Neither of them will gain by demanding a larger share of the\r\nother, which neither can afford. They must look elsewhere for a remedy;\r\nand I directed them where to look by giving them the example of Holland\r\nand its commercial vicissitudes.”\r\n\r\n“Rich to overflowing in the fifteenth century; since, well nigh ruined.\r\nHow was this? From too much capital leaving the country?”\r\n\r\n“From the causes which led to such transfer of capital. While Holland\r\nwas accumulating its wealth, profits were first high, and then gradually\r\nlowered in proportion to wages, though still increasing in total amount.\r\nIt was not till heavy taxation reduced the rate of profits below that of\r\nother countries....”\r\n\r\n“But does not taxation affect wages too?”\r\n\r\n“Assuredly; but the labourer uses fewer commodities than the capitalist,\r\nand therefore there is a limit to the labourer’s taxation, beyond which\r\ntaxes must fall on profits, and reduce them as effectually as a\r\ndeterioration of the land could do. Well; this being the case in\r\nHolland, more than in the neighbouring countries, Dutch capital flowed\r\ninto those countries; and the Dutch have engaged largely in the carrying\r\ntrade, in foreign funds, and in loans to the merchants of other\r\ncountries, because all this capital could be less advantageously\r\nemployed at home. No country need or ought to come to such a pass as\r\nthis; for, where there is an economical government, taxation may be a\r\ntrifle compared with what it was in Holland after the wars of the\r\nRepublic; and where there is a liberal commercial system,—that is, no\r\nunnecessary check upon the supply of food, accumulation may proceed to\r\nan undefinable extent without an injurious fall of wages and profits.\r\nThus may the cultivation of poor soils be rendered needless, the\r\nconsequent rise of rent be checked, and the fall of profits and wages\r\nobviated.”\r\n\r\n“What we want then is, a regulation of the supply of the labour-market,\r\na lightening of taxation, and a liberal commercial system. But, Henry,\r\nwhere is the eloquence of all this?—that which is commonly called\r\neloquence? It seems to me more like a lecture than a speech.”\r\n\r\n“And so it was; but these are days when, to the people, naked truth is\r\nthe best eloquence. They are sufferers; they look for a way out of their\r\nsufferings; and the plainest way is to them the fairest. However, I said\r\nto them much that there is no need to say to you,—because you know it\r\nalready,—of my views of what the spirit of society ought to be, in\r\ncontrast with what it is. I enlarged,—whether eloquently I know not,—but\r\nI am sure fervently,—as fervently as ever any advocate of co-operation\r\nspoke,—on the rule ‘for each and for all;’ showing that there is actual\r\nco-operation wherever individual interests are righteously pursued,\r\nsince the general interest is made up of individual interests. I showed\r\nthat justice requires the individual appropriation of the fruits of\r\nindividual effort; that is, the maintenance of the institution of\r\nproperty; and that producers do as much for all, as well as for each, by\r\ncarrying their produce to market themselves, as by casting it into a\r\ncommon stock.”\r\n\r\n“For instance, that A. does as great a public service by bringing a\r\nhundred hats to exchange for tables and stockings, and whatever else he\r\nmay happen to want, as B. by letting the exchange be conducted as an\r\naffair of partnership.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Let people have partnerships as large as they like, and make\r\nsavings thereby, if they find they can. But let them beware of the\r\nnotion that any competition but the struggle for food is the cause of\r\nhardship; and that struggle must take place under both systems, unless\r\nthe same means are used by both to prevent it. As for the question of\r\ntime, the struggle will take place soonest under that system which\r\naffords the least stimulus to productive industry. “And, now, love, you\r\nhave the pith of my speech, except of those best parts which you have\r\nmany a time rehearsed to me, and I to you. Of the ‘hear, hears,’ and\r\nclappings, you learned enough last night.”\r\n\r\n“I wish I could have been there,” sighed the wife.\r\n\r\n“So do I. Well as you know the aspect of an attentive crowd, you can\r\nhave little idea of the stimulating excitement of political meetings\r\njust now.”\r\n\r\n“I can imagine it. The true romance of human life lies among the poorer\r\nclasses; the most rapid vicissitudes, the strongest passions, the most\r\nundiluted emotions, the most eloquent deportment, the truest experience\r\nare there. These things are marked on their countenances, and displayed\r\nby their gestures; and yet these things are almost untouched by our\r\nartists; be they dramatists, painters, or novelists. The richest know\r\nbest what is meant by the monotony of existence, however little this may\r\nappear to their poor neighbours who see them driving about as if life\r\ndepended on their speed, and traversing kingdoms and continents. Yet\r\nfrom the upper and middling classes are the fine arts mainly furnished\r\nwith their subjects. This is wrong; for life in its reality cannot\r\nbecome known by hearsay; and by hearsay only is there any notion of it\r\namong those who feel themselves set above its struggles and its toils:\r\nthat is, by the greater part of the aristocracy.”\r\n\r\n“Thank heaven! not by you or me,” replied her husband. “An uninformed\r\nobserver might think that there is monotony before us at present,\r\nsitting as we are, watching the snow-flakes fall with the few leaves\r\nwhich had lingered aloft till now,—with weeks of retirement in prospect,\r\nand nothing apparent to wish or work for. Yet you have had enough, love,\r\nof struggle and toil to know what real life is; and I have, of late,\r\nbegun to learn the same lesson. No fear of monotony for us!”\r\n\r\n“No fear; since there are all to live for as well as each, and each\r\nother. But, Henry, how is it that there is so little made known where it\r\nmost wants to be known, of what real life is when trained by that best\r\nof educations, vicissitude?”\r\n\r\n“Because our painters of life do not take into the account,—in fact know\r\nlittle of,—some of the most important circumstances which constitute\r\nlife, in the best sense of the word. They lay hold of the great\r\ncircumstances which happen to all, the landmarks of universal human\r\nexistence, and overlook those which are not less interesting, though not\r\nuniversal. They take Love; and think it more becoming to describe a\r\nLetitia going to the altar with a lord F——, than a weaver and his\r\nthoughtful bride taking possession of their two rooms, after long\r\nwaiting and anxiety. They take Bereavement; and think it the same thing\r\nwhether they describe the manly grief of an Ormond for his gallant\r\nOssory, or the silent woe of a poverty-stricken widow for her laborious\r\nand dutiful son. They take Birth; and would rather have a lady F——\r\nbending over the infant heir of a lordly house, with a Thérèse in\r\nwaiting ... (My dear, why not describe that which shall be as well as\r\nthat which has been?)—a lady F—— and her infant, I say, than some rustic\r\nMary holding up her boy to smile in father’s face when he comes home\r\nfrom the plough. There is no harm in all this, provided the mighty\r\nremainder is not overlooked, which is at the bottom of the most\r\nportentous heavings of society,—which explains all that is to many\r\nunaccountable in the doings of the world they live in. If the\r\naristocracy cannot, by their own experience, get to know all that life\r\nis,—though they are born, love, marry, suffer, enjoy, and die, let some\r\nidea be given them of it by true images held up in the mirror of their\r\nstudies.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; let humble life be shown to them in all its strong and strange\r\nvarieties; not only in faithful butlers and housekeepers,—in pretty\r\ndairy-maids and gossiping barbers. Let us have in books, in pictures,\r\nand on the stage, working men and women, in the various periods of their\r\nstruggles through life. In the meanwhile, these people should in\r\nfairness know that the aristocracy are less aware than is supposed,—less\r\nthan they will be,—of what is being done and suffered on each side of\r\ntheir smooth and dull path.”\r\n\r\n“Let the artists be compassionately considered too, I pray,” said lord\r\nF——, smiling. “Granting all that can be urged about their limiting their\r\nchoice of objects, let us be considerate till they have placed\r\nthemselves at large. What, for instance, could a weaver of fiction make\r\nof our present life?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing of a story; only a picture; there being, as you said just now,\r\napparent monotony without, and deep stirrings within. Such a writer, if\r\nwishing to make a narrative, must take either my former life,—its\r\nperplexities, its poverty, its struggles under its first publicity, its\r\nlabours, its love, and migration into a new state;—or your future\r\none,—the statesman’s honourable toils, joined with the patriot’s\r\nconflicts and consolations.”\r\n\r\n“But if there was good reason for taking up precisely the interval,—from\r\nour marriage till this hour;—what then?”\r\n\r\n“Then writer and readers must be contented with little narrative;\r\ncontented to know what passes within us, since so little happens to us.\r\nWould there be nothing to instruct and gratify in pictures of our\r\nposition, in revelations of our hearts, and records of our\r\nconversations?”\r\n\r\n“Let us comfort ourselves, Letitia, with deciding that it must be the\r\nfault of the recorder if there were not.”\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n          _Summary of Principles illustrated in this volume._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe produce of labour and capital, after rent has been paid, is divided\r\nbetween the labourer and the capitalist, under the names of Wages and\r\nProfits.\r\n\r\nWhere there are two shares, each determines the other, provided they\r\npress equally upon one another.\r\n\r\nThe increase of the supply of labour, claiming reward, makes the\r\npressure in the present case unequal, and renders wages the regulator of\r\nprofits.\r\n\r\nThe restriction of the supply of food causes the fall of both profits\r\nand wages.\r\n\r\nThe increased expense of raising food enhances its price: labour, both\r\nagricultural and manufacturing, becomes dearer, (without advantage to\r\nthe labourer:) this rise of wages causes profits to fall; and this fall\r\nbrings after it a reduction of the labourer’s share, or a fall of wages.\r\n\r\nThe fall of profits and wages is thus referrible to the same cause which\r\nraises rent;—to an inequality in the fertility of soils.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed by some that these tendencies to the fall of wages and\r\nprofits may be counteracted by abolishing the distinctions of shares,\r\nand casting the whole produce of land, capital, and labour, into a\r\ncommon stock. But this is a fallacy.\r\n\r\nFor, whatever may be the saving effected by an extensive partnership,\r\nsuch partnership does not affect the natural laws by which population\r\nincreases faster than capital. The diminution of the returns to capital\r\nmust occasion poverty to a multiplying society, whether those returns\r\nare appropriated by individuals under the competitive system, or equally\r\ndistributed among the members of a co-operative community.\r\n\r\nThe same checks to the deterioration of the resources of society are\r\nnecessary under each system.\r\n\r\nThese are, (in addition to the agricultural improvements continually\r\ntaking place,)—\r\n\r\n1. The due limitation of the number of consumers.\r\n\r\n2. The lightening of the public burdens, which at present abstract a\r\nlarge proportion of profits and wages.\r\n\r\n3. A liberal commercial system which shall obviate the necessity of\r\nbringing poor soils into cultivation.\r\n\r\nLondon: Printed by W.

Steele was settled as a factor at Bordeaux, and\r\nhis business was to purchase wines from the growers, and ship them to\r\nhis employers in England. His occupation had brought him acquainted with\r\nalmost every vine-grower within fifty leagues of Bordeaux; and in the\r\ncase of one of these, Antoine Luyon, the acquaintance had ripened into a\r\nfriendship. Antoine was part owner of some vineyards on the western bank\r\nof the Garonne, one of which produced claret of a singularly fine\r\nquality,—too good to command an advantageous sale at Paris, where second\r\nand third-rate wines are in nearly equal esteem with the first. The\r\nproduce of this small and rich vineyard was therefore set apart for\r\nEnglish sale, and had been bargained for by the house which Steele\r\nrepresented, and the terms agreed upon for the vintage of the five next\r\nseasons. Other vineyards belonging to the same parties touched upon this\r\npeculiarly favoured one; but not all the care and pains that could be\r\ntaken availed to make their produce better than second or third-rate.\r\nTheir aspect was a little more to the east and less to the south; they\r\nwere not so perfectly sheltered behind; and no art could temper their\r\nsoil to the exact point of perfection enjoyed by La Haute Favorite, as\r\nthis distinguished vineyard was called. Their produce was, however, as\r\nvaluable as that of most of the estates around, and was in good esteem\r\nat Paris, where Antoine’s partner, his brother Charles, was settled as a\r\nwine-merchant; and where he bestowed as much pains on the maturing of\r\nthe stock in his cellars as Antoine did on its first ripening in the\r\nform of grapes, or their friend Steele on the processes of fining,\r\nracking, and mixing, which were carried on at his employers’ depôt at\r\nBordeaux. Much care and skill were required in all these departments of\r\nbusiness; and the young men were exemplary in both, pursuing their\r\noccupation as a matter of taste as well as of necessity. Steele watched\r\nthe thermometer in his cellars as carefully as Antoine observed winds\r\nand clouds; and their common interest in the welfare of Favorite\r\nquickened their friendship, in one way among many, by occasioning more\r\nfrequent meetings than they would otherwise have thought practicable.\r\nMany a trip to Bordeaux did Antoine contrive to ascertain the effects of\r\nheat or cold on the wines in their third or fourth season; or to give\r\nthe alarm if he heard rumours of buildings being pulled down or erected\r\nso near the premises as to have any influence over the temperature\r\nwithin: and during the summer, Steele was wont to go up the river on\r\nSaturdays, and spend the Sunday with his friend Antoine for the avowed\r\npurpose of paying his devoirs to La Favorite.—There was much to tempt\r\nhim to these excursions, if wine had made no part of his interest, for a\r\nfairer territory than that through which the Garonne held its course was\r\nseldom seen. There were harvests of a more picturesque growth than even\r\nthose which embellished the vineyards. Interspersed with the meadows\r\nwhich sloped down to the river, were groves of olives and forests of\r\nchestnuts, and in due season, the almond trees put forth their pink\r\nblossoms amidst the dark shadows of the evergreen woods. Boats heavily\r\nladen with the merchandise of the Levant, brought hither by means of the\r\ngrand Languedoc canal, passed down the blue and brimming river, or\r\nreturned, borne rapidly on the tide, and empty of all but the boatmen in\r\ntheir red jackets, whose snatches of song reached the shore on the\r\nfragrant breeze. The cottages of the peasantry were indeed few, and\r\ncomfortless in appearance; but the chateaux of the gentry arose here and\r\nthere, not half buried in woods, like English mansions, but conspicuous\r\non terraces, and rendered in some degree imposing by the appliances of\r\nart, which did not, however, in the eye of the Englishman, compensate\r\nfor the natural attractions which a fine taste would have gathered round\r\nthem. Even stone balustrades and fountains, and artificial terraces,\r\nhowever, as long as they were intermixed with corn-fields and olive\r\ngroves, had charms for one whose residence was commonly in the city; and\r\nin process of time, he began to contemplate the chateau of the marquis\r\nde Thou, which commanded the vicinity of Antoine’s residence, with\r\nsomething of the admiration, though with nothing of the awe, with which\r\nit was regarded by the peasantry round.\r\n\r\nWhether this admiration was increased or lessened by the glimpses he\r\noccasionally obtained of its inhabitants, he could himself have hardly\r\ndetermined. The first time he saw the marquis he was moved to laughter;\r\nbut then the marquis was alone (except the laquais in his rear) sitting\r\nbolt upright on his horse, with his enormous queue reaching down to the\r\nlittle skirts of his coat, and his large light blue eyes and pursed-up\r\nmouth giving a ludicrous mixture of vacancy and solemnity to his\r\ncountenance. But when the marquis de Thou was seen parading the terrace\r\nwith his beautiful daughter, the lady Alice, by his side, or following\r\nthe sports of the field with a train of the noblesse, assembled in all\r\nthe grandeur of feudal array, he who looked insignificant in his\r\nindividuality gathered some advantage from the grace or splendour around\r\nhim. He was regarded as the father and protector of the fair creature\r\nwho seemed to tread on air within the vast circumference of her hoop,\r\nand whose eyes shone forth from beneath her enormous head-dress like\r\nglow-worms in a thicket; and again, the marquis was the host of the\r\nwealthy and the gay who held sway in the land which was for ever\r\nboasting its own likeness to Paradise: so that, in time, the marquis\r\nbecame mixed up with his connexions even in the mind of the Englishman;\r\nand instead of laughing, Steele learned to uncover and bow low at the\r\napproach of the great man, in the same manner as Antoine. If he had\r\nknown as much as the natives of the territory of certain deeds which\r\nwere done, and certain customs which were prevalent there, his English\r\nheart might have forbidden his raising his hand to his head in token of\r\nrespect; but though he disliked the French peasantry, he was not fully\r\naware how many of their bad qualities were directly attributable to the\r\ninfluence of the order of which the marquis de Thou was one of the\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion, Antoine awaited on the bank the landing of his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n“Ah ha!” cried the Frenchman, as soon as he could make himself heard;\r\n“you look up into our blue sky with the same admiration as when you\r\nfirst saw it, four seasons ago. Well; even Bordeaux has its smoke, and\r\nnow and then a sea haze.”\r\n\r\n“So thick an one this morning,” replied Steele, “that I could have\r\nfancied myself in an English port.”\r\n\r\n“Do the captains foretell a change of wind?” inquired Antoine. “I rather\r\napprehend one; and it is a pity that Favorite should risk losing a\r\nparticle of her beauty. Come and see her,—as bright as a May morning; as\r\nrich and mellow as an autumn noon. It would grieve my soul if an unkind\r\nwind should hurt her; but there are signs of a change.”\r\n\r\nThe young men turned their steps towards the vineyards, instead of to\r\nAntoine’s dwelling, as Steele needed no refreshment but that of seeing\r\nhow his dearly-beloved vines flourished, and enjoying the beautiful walk\r\nwhich led to the enclosures. On this occasion, he looked about him more\r\nthan usual as he passed, as the peasantry were abroad, and evidently in\r\na state of excitement and uneasiness. One and another stopped the young\r\nmen to ask if they knew what direction the hunt had taken, and whether\r\nit could be conjectured how long a chase the boar might cause the\r\ngentry. Steele now learned for the first time, how eminently a boar hunt\r\nwas an occasion of terror and hardship to the country people. He saw\r\nthem mount the highest trees to look out, and lay their ears to the\r\nground to detect the distant tread of horses. He heard them mutter\r\nprayers that their fences might remain unbroken, and their crops\r\nuntrodden.\r\n\r\n“I should not have thought your peasants could be so anxious about their\r\nlittle harvests,” he observed to Antoine. “Judging from the state of\r\ntheir plots of land, I should suppose them careless about their tillage.\r\nHow weedy this field is! And the hay in that meadow was, as I remember,\r\nnot cut for weeks after the proper time.”\r\n\r\n“It is no fault of theirs,” replied Antoine. “The law forbids hoeing and\r\nweeding, lest the young partridges should be hurt; and the hay must not\r\nbe cut before a certain day, let the season be what it will, lest the\r\ngame should be deprived of shelter. Many crops are thus spoiled.”\r\n\r\n“What tyranny!” exclaimed the Englishman. “But some fault seems still to\r\nremain with the cultivators. They do not use half the manure at their\r\ndisposal, while their land evidently wants it much. Yonder field is an\r\ninstance.”\r\n\r\n“Certain sorts of manure are thought to give an unpleasant flavour to\r\nthe birds which subsist on the grain which springs from them,” replied\r\nAntoine. “Such manure is not allowed to be used.”\r\n\r\nOn Steele’s exclaiming again that such prohibitions were too arbitrary\r\nto be endured, Antoine laughed, and wondered what he would say to\r\ncertain other regulations, in comparison with which these were trifles.\r\nWhat did he think of the lot of those who were sent to the galleys for\r\nhaving entered or approached the groves where the wild pigeons of the\r\nmarquis were appointed to breed undisturbed; or of such as were ruined\r\nby being taken from their tillage to make for him ornamental roads which\r\nled nowhere; or by the fines which they had to pay in commutation of the\r\nservice of keeping the frogs quiet by night? On one side the chateau, a\r\nmarsh extended for some distance, and its frogs greatly annoyed a former\r\nmarquis by their croaking. His peasantry were employed to beat the\r\nponds. By degrees, as the nuisance decreased, this service was commuted\r\nfor a fine,—and a very oppressive one it was found at this day. Antoine\r\nwas proceeding to describe another grievance of great magnitude, when\r\nhis description was superseded by an example.\r\n\r\nThe young men were now in a chestnut grove, within which the distant\r\nsounds of the hunt were beginning to be heard. A figure of a peasant\r\ncrossed the glades at intervals, and an occasional voice hailed them\r\nfrom overhead, where lookers out were perched on the loftiest trees to\r\nwatch what course the devastation of the boar and its hunters would\r\ntake. After a few moments of quiet, a cry burst forth, and was echoed\r\nfrom mouth to mouth through the wood, a heavy plunging tread was heard,\r\nand a rushing and crashing in the thicket, which warned Steele to fly to\r\nthe protection of the largest trunk at hand, while Antoine climbed a\r\ntree as nimbly as a squirrel. The ferocious, clumsy animal immediately\r\nappeared, its small eyes red and flaming, its coarse hide bristling, and\r\nits terrific tusks looking as if they could plough up the very ground\r\nover which it rushed headlong. The moment the danger was past, Antoine\r\ndescended, and followed at full speed to see the issue of the chase;\r\nSteele keeping up with his companion as well as he could, but not\r\nwithout some qualms lest the beast should be met at the extremity of the\r\nwood, and driven back upon his steps. The hunt was a little too late,\r\nhowever, to accomplish this manœuvre, and Steele began to feel himself\r\nsomewhat more comfortable, when a cry of horror from Antoine, who was a\r\nlittle way in advance, renewed all his fears.\r\n\r\n“O, Favorite! O La Haute Favorite!” cried he. “She is spoiled,—she will\r\nbe wholly desolated by the monster and the hunters!” And poor Antoine\r\nthrew himself down at the foot of a tree, and would look no more. His\r\ncompanion saw one horseman after another leap the fence which had been\r\nkept in such perfect repair, watched them wheeling round and round among\r\nthe choice vines, which they must be treading like so much common grass,\r\nand finally follow the boar out at the opposite side, while the servants\r\nwho attended in the rear wantonly rode over the same ground, when they\r\nmight just as easily have kept the road. In a great passion, Steele flew\r\nto warn, and threaten, and scold; but before he had time to commit\r\nhimself, Antoine was at hand to interpose, and silence the indignant\r\nEnglishman.\r\n\r\n“I cannot conceive what you mean, Antoine,” cried Steele, the moment\r\nthey had the place to themselves. “You flung yourself upon the ground in\r\nas great an agony as if your bride had been snatched from you; and\r\npresently you come to speak these rascals as fair as if they had done\r\nyou a favour!”\r\n\r\n“It is the only way to keep what we have left,” replied Antoine,\r\nmournfully. “There is no use, but much peril, in complaint. Redress\r\nthere is none; and ill-will towards the lord’s pleasure is resented more\r\ndeeply and lastingly than injury to his property. You may rob his\r\nchateau of its plate, and be more easily forgiven than for repining at\r\nanything which happens in the course of his sports.”\r\n\r\nSteele was ready to burst with indignation against the people which\r\npermitted such usages to endure. He was answered by a reference to the\r\ncruel old forest laws of England, and certain national blemishes of an\r\nanalogous character which still remained; and the friends were in danger\r\nof quarrelling, for the first time, when they remembered that it would\r\nbe more to the purpose to contemplate the present than the past and the\r\nabsent, and to help one another under the vexatious event which had\r\nbefallen them.\r\n\r\nIt was mournful to look around, and see what had been done within a few\r\nminutes;—the clean soil trodden and strewed, the props thrown down, the\r\nladen branches snapped off, the ripening fruit crushed and scattered,\r\nand the whole laid open to intruders; whether men to steal, or troops of\r\ndeer to browze. If, by any exertion, these intruders could be kept out,\r\nthere was hope that some, even a considerable portion, of the expected\r\nvintage might be saved, as some rows of vines had not been touched, and\r\nothers had fallen merely from their supports being removed. Antoine set\r\noff in search of labourers. Not one would follow him till the issue of\r\nthe hunt was known, and it became certain whose fields would be\r\ndevastated before the sun went down, and whose not; but when the boar’s\r\nhead was at length carried towards the chateau, with the usual honours,\r\nand the proud train returned to their stately festivities, a gang of\r\npeasants, safe for this bout, set to work, under Antoine and Steele, to\r\nstop up the fences till they could be properly repaired; while their\r\nless fortunate neighbours hid themselves to groan over the destroyed\r\nharvests which were their only hope;—hid themselves, because if their\r\nown little children had spoken of their grief, the galleys would\r\ninfallibly be their destination ere long. Neither those who chaunted\r\nover their work, however, nor those who brooded over wrongs within, nor\r\nthe two young men who toiled, went home, and retired to rest in gloomy\r\nsilence, anticipated what would be their relative position at the same\r\nhour the next evening. Nothing could now appear more certain to Antoine\r\nthan that he and his brother had sustained a great loss in the\r\ndestruction of half the crop of their best vineyard, or to Steele than\r\nthat it would be a misfortune to his employers to be disappointed of\r\nhalf the quantity of that superlative wine which they were to have on\r\nfavourable terms, and might sell at almost any price they might choose\r\nto set upon it: yet another turn of fortune happened within a few hours\r\nwhich promised to do more than repair the pecuniary damage, though it\r\nstill remained to be lamented that La Haute Favorite should have been\r\nexposed to wanton devastation.\r\n\r\nThe next day was the day of the extraordinary hurricane which spread\r\naffright through various regions of France, where there was want and woe\r\nenough before to shake the courage and perplex the judgment of rulers,\r\nand to appal the hearts of the ruled. The timid had long been inquiring\r\nhow the national burdens were to be borne for the future, and the\r\npopular discontents much longer soothed. When this dreadful tempest\r\ncame, extinguishing the light of day like an eclipse, changing the\r\naspect of the scenery like an earthquake, and convulsing the atmosphere\r\nlike a hurricane, mere timidity became deepened into a superstitious\r\nhorror, and the powers of hell were thought to be let loose against the\r\ndevoted land. Few could wonder much at this who knew the people in their\r\nstate of ignorance and hardship, and who witnessed the ravages of the\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nThe morning had risen fair and bright, though cold, from the change of\r\nwind which Antoine had predicted. The clouds soon began to gather, with\r\nan appearance of unusual blackness; but this did not prevent the country\r\npeople from setting out for church, and making their way thither in\r\ndefiance of the rising blasts. When assembled, however, they found it\r\nperilous to remain under the shelter of a roof which threatened to fall\r\nin upon them; and they rushed out into the road, where, carefully\r\navoiding the neighbourhood of trees, they supported one another during\r\nthe dreadful hour that the storm lasted. Cries of grief and despair\r\nbroke from them at every step as they returned homewards. Drifts of hail\r\nstopped up their path. The corn-fields were one vast morass. The almond\r\ngroves were level with the ground; and of the chestnut woods nothing\r\nremained but an assemblage of bare poles. The more exposed vineyards\r\nwere so many quagmires, and many dwellings were mere heaps of ruins. All\r\nwho witnessed were horror-struck at the conviction of general,\r\nimmediate, pressing want; and the more thoughtful glanced forwards in\r\nidea to the number of seasons that must pass away before all this damage\r\ncould be repaired. Not a few, in the midst of their own distress,\r\nhowever, jested on the fate of the marquis’s partridges, and consoled\r\none another with the certainty that it would be long before the lord’s\r\ngame could trouble them again.\r\n\r\nAs for Antoine, he hurried past his ruined garden to La Favorite,\r\ngloomily followed by the Englishman, who could not be comforted by his\r\ncompanion’s suggestion, that, at the worst, the soil would be finely\r\nmanured by its produce being beaten into it. This was not exactly the\r\nobject for which Steele had anticipated the fine crop would be used, and\r\nhe could not, so rapidly as a Frenchman, acquiesce in so complete a\r\nchange of purposes. It would be difficult to say which was the most\r\nastonished and the most joyful when they found their beloved Favorite\r\nsmiling amidst the general devastation, and scarcely more injured than\r\nwhen they had left her the night before. Sheltered by the hill behind,\r\nand by a wood on the side whence the hurricane approached, she had\r\nescaped its worst fury; and a few torn branches, a few scattered\r\nhailstones, were the only witnesses of the storm which had passed over\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“My beauty! My beloved!” exclaimed Antoine; “though man and beast have\r\ndared to insult thee, the elements have known how to respect thy beauty.\r\nThey just paid thee a gentle homage as they passed, and left thee serene\r\nand verdant, while all besides is prostrated before them. My homage\r\nshall restore the few charms that have been defaced.”\r\n\r\nAnd, somewhat to Steele’s surprise, Antoine began the homage he spoke\r\nof, reverentially lifting the trailing branches, coaxing the battered\r\nbunches of grapes, and restoring props with a sort of joyful solemnity,\r\nas if rendering service to one who could appreciate his devotion. The\r\ncooler Englishman meanwhile looked abroad into the neighbouring\r\nvineyards, and saw with concern that the losses of Antoine and his\r\nbrother must be great. Antoine would scarcely allow this, however, not\r\nonly because the safety of Favorite had filled him with joy, but because\r\nhe believed that his fortunes would be rather amended than the contrary\r\nby what had happened.\r\n\r\n“How should that be?” inquired Steele. “The enormous rise in value of\r\nthe produce of this vineyard will not benefit you, but my employers, as\r\nour terms are fixed for five years to come. How can you gain by being\r\ndeprived of the rest of your vintage?”\r\n\r\n“We shall gain by others being deprived of theirs. Vast labour will be\r\nrequired to render these lands productive once more, and the price of\r\nwines will therefore be much raised.”\r\n\r\n“But you will have to employ and pay for this labour as well as others.”\r\n\r\n“True; but meanwhile, we have a large stock of wine at Paris and\r\nBordeaux. For some little time there has been no demand; for the country\r\nis troubled, and no one will buy more than cannot be avoided. This has\r\nmade Charles uneasy, and he has often lately complained of the largeness\r\nof our stock. Now that there will be a failure in the supply of wines,\r\nour stock will be in request, and at such prices as shall pay all the\r\nlabour of repairs in our vineyards, and leave no small advantage\r\nbesides. And then,—how our grounds are manured! What crops they will\r\nyield!”\r\n\r\n“Aye; but when?—You never will see the dark side of an affair, Antoine.\r\nIt will be three or four years before yon quagmires can become a firm\r\nsoil, full of well-settled and bearing vines.”\r\n\r\n“Meantime, things will become more tranquil at Paris, perhaps, so that\r\npeople may enjoy their wine as formerly.”\r\n\r\n“Some persons,” observed Steele, “would repine at the terms we have\r\nfixed beyond recall for the produce of Favorite; but I hear no\r\ncomplaints from you of the large profits which will be made by my\r\nemployers.”\r\n\r\n“Where would be the use?” replied Antoine. “Since the bargain is, as you\r\nsay, beyond recall, it is no longer my affair. On the contrary, I\r\ncongratulate your gentlemen with all my heart.—There is but one thing\r\nthat I would suggest;—that if their gains prove great, they should\r\npurchase the blessing of heaven on them by devoting some small portion\r\nto the peasants here who are ruined by the same cause which brings your\r\nfriends prosperity.”\r\n\r\n“There will no doubt be a general subscription,” observed Steele; “and\r\nit is fitting that those foreigners should give who will profit by the\r\ndisasters of your country.”\r\n\r\n“If your gentlemen,” replied Antoine, “will do it in the form of\r\nremitting a portion of Favorite’s wealth, they will add grace to their\r\nbounty. How graceful will it be in this, our beauty, to thank heaven for\r\nhaving spared her charms by giving in alms a portion of her dowry!”\r\n\r\n“Will your people distinguish, think you,” asked Steele, laughing,\r\n“between alms issuing from an English merchant’s pocket, in his own name\r\nand in the name of a personified vineyard?”\r\n\r\nAntoine warmly replied that no people on earth had so nice a sense of\r\nthe morally graceful and sublime as the French; and offered a wager that\r\nin the straightforward case, plain thanks in prose would be all that\r\nMessrs. Mason and Co. would receive; while, if the moral grace he\r\nrecommended were put into the act, La Haute Favorite would be celebrated\r\nin song under many a clump of elms.\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile,” said Steele, “what measures will you take about your\r\nprivate affairs, and how can I help you?”\r\n\r\n“I will this day write to Charles tidings of what has happened.\r\nTo-morrow I will see what portion of the crops out of this enclosure can\r\nbe saved. The produce must be housed at Bordeaux, and no more\r\ntransported to Paris this year.—You can aid me no otherwise than in the\r\ncare of Favorite, and in soothing the poor whom I dread to meet on my\r\nway home. Exhort them, as I ever do, to make the best of inevitable\r\nevils.”\r\n\r\n“Your example will do more than my exhortations. But what is left to\r\nmake the best of?”\r\n\r\n“The marquis and his daughter. They can no longer be a torment, and may\r\nbe a help. The new works, for which he oppressed the people, are\r\ndestroyed. His pigeons are blown away, and his partridges are drowned;\r\nand even the frogs may be found to be eternally silenced by this\r\nexcessive beating of their ponds: while still the people have an\r\nequitable claim for food. Let us go and comfort them thus.”\r\n\r\nAnd the good-natured Antoine carried his cheerful countenance among the\r\nshivering and dismayed peasantry who were waiting for advice and\r\nguidance, and led them to the chateau to ask for relief.\r\n\r\nThe marquis laid his hand upon his heart, and the lady Alice took\r\ntrinkets from her hair to give to the hungry people before her, who were\r\nloud in their praises of her condescension; though, to be sure, as\r\ntrinkets could not be eaten, and there was nothing eatable for them to\r\nbe exchanged against, they only served at present to hush little crying\r\nbabies for a minute or two. In time it was clearly conveyed to the lady\r\nthat a more effectual measure would be to order the housekeeper to\r\ndistribute the contents of the larder among the hungry; and to the\r\ngentleman, that now was the occasion for his steward to unlock the\r\ngranary. These stores being soon exhausted, and no more being at once\r\nprocurable, from the whole neighbouring country having been laid waste,\r\nthe cottagers were obliged to subsist themselves as well as they could\r\non boiled acorns, stewed nettles, and on the lord’s frogs; a race which\r\nseemed destined to extermination, man and the elements having apparently\r\ncombined against them.\r\n\r\nAs many of the sufferers as yet survive look back upon that dreadful\r\ntime with a horror which is not lessened even by the political horrors\r\nwhich ensued. Throughout Guienne, the Orleannois, and other provinces,\r\nnot a score of revolutions could efface the recollections and traditions\r\nof the hurricane of July, 1788. Perhaps it may be still a subject of\r\ndispute a century hence whether it was charged, in addition to the\r\nnatural agents of destruction, with a special message to warn the French\r\nnation of their approaching social convulsion. Superstition has not yet\r\nbeen abolished in France, any more than in some other countries which\r\nhave suffered less deplorably from its sway.\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                           SIGNS OF THE TIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Luyon was wont to hasten home at dinner-time with as much\r\ncheerfulness in his countenance as alacrity in his gait. He always had a\r\nsmile ready when his timid wife looked anxiously in his face, and\r\ngenerally some tidings which were not bad, when her aged father, M.\r\nRaucourt, asked his invariable question,—“What news, Charles?” Times\r\nwere now, however, altering so speedily that it was evident that Charles\r\nmust vary his entré. His smile he was likely enough to preserve, happen\r\nwhat might; but in the article of news he began to be perplexed; for\r\nwhatever was now stirring was of a kind with which it was painful to\r\nconfuse and trouble a very old man, who never went abroad, but yet\r\nmanaged to know something of what was going on by fixing his seat\r\nconstantly at the window, and using his eyes, which were less infirm\r\nthan his understanding. The children too, who were old enough to be\r\ninquisitive, began to be very pertinacious in their questions why their\r\nwalks were circumscribed, and what was the meaning of various strange\r\nsights and sounds which they met at every turn. In satisfying them why\r\nthe drums beat, and why orators talked so loud in the mobs, Charles\r\nnever used the word riot,—much less rebellion, or revolution, either of\r\nwhich might have been fatal to his wife’s peace; for she had been bred a\r\nroyalist by her father, and had a perfect horror of even a disrespectful\r\nword against the royal family or the noblesse. What Charles was in\r\npolitics, she could never tell. He seemed to adopt no party, to talk\r\nsensibly on what took place before his eyes, and (judging by what had\r\nalready come to pass) to prophecy clearly respecting the future. He\r\npointed out to her that the people were starving, and of course\r\ndisaffected; but he did not say where the blame rested, contenting\r\nhimself with hoping the best, as he did on all occasions.\r\n\r\nOn the day that he received the tidings of the ravages of the storm in\r\nGuienne, Marguerite did, for once, perceive a slight shade on her\r\nhusband’s brow. The family were standing at the window, beside the old\r\nman’s easy chair, eagerly gazing into the street, which was filled from\r\nend to end with a mob. The aspect of the people was terrific, and their\r\nclamour, compounded of the shrill voices of the fishwomen and the more\r\ndeep-toned yells of haggard and half-famished men, was deafening. The\r\nold gentleman looked full of glee, for he had contrived to persuade\r\nhimself that all this was rejoicing for some royal festival. The wiser\r\nchildren looked in their mother’s face for an explanation; but she could\r\nattend to nothing else when she saw her husband enter.\r\n\r\n“Thank God, Charles, you are home! How did you get in?”\r\n\r\n“I have been in this half hour.”\r\n\r\n“And shut up by yourself? There is something the matter, Charles.”\r\n\r\nCharles gave in brief the story of the storm, which included the tidings\r\nthat certain olive and almond groves, her own property, were utterly\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n“Charles, Charles,” interrupted the old man, as soon as the mob had\r\npassed; “what news to-day?”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid what you have just seen tells only too plainly, sir. The\r\npeople are gone to the palace to vociferate for bread.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well, fashions change,” observed M. Raucourt. “In my days the\r\nking gave away wine instead of bread.”\r\n\r\n“If he did so now, sir, it would be a good thing for my trade. It would\r\nempty my cellars to supply such a crowd as has just gone by.”\r\n\r\n“Does not your wine sell, this year?”\r\n\r\n“Not very well, sir. People buy little of anything at present; but\r\nbetter times will certainly come.”\r\n\r\n“But, papa, why do not all these people buy bread, if they want it so\r\nvery much?” asked Julien.\r\n\r\n“Because there is very little to be bought; and that little is too dear\r\nfor poor people to buy.”\r\n\r\n“So they want the king to buy it for them?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but the king says he has no money. He is borrowing some, however,\r\nand I hope the people will soon be relieved, somehow or other.”\r\n\r\n“Who lends the king money, papa?”\r\n\r\n“I am going to lend him some; and so will everybody else that has any.”\r\n\r\nLittle Pauline thought it would be the better and quicker way for her\r\npapa to buy the bread himself for the poor, instead of lending money to\r\nthe king to do so. She was told that perhaps the people might begin to\r\nlove the king again if he tried to relieve them; and that his majesty\r\nwould be much pleased at this, for they had not been at all fond of him\r\nlately. This news set Marguerite sighing, and the children thinking what\r\nthey had that they could lend the king. Grandpapa was consulted, while\r\nhis son and daughter retired from the window to read Antoine’s letter.\r\nM. Raucourt thought the king would not wish for Julien’s bird-organ, as\r\nhe often heard finer music than it could make, and it would now buy very\r\nlittle bread; but why it would buy so little, he could not tell. He\r\nrecommended Pauline’s making her offering to the queen;—that beautiful,\r\ngraceful lady that every Frenchman worshipped when she became his queen,\r\nand whom every Frenchman would mourn in the dust when the time must come\r\nfor her to die. The old man was entering upon his favourite long story\r\nof the queen’s entry into her capital, when Pauline stopped him with an\r\nenquiry whether this beautiful lady would like to have her silk-worms,\r\nand how much bread they would buy. As soon as grandpapa could speak for\r\nlaughing, he told the child that the queen carried more silk on her head\r\nat that moment than these worms would spin in a hundred years. The\r\nlittle dog Joli, with his collar and silver bell, was next proposed, and\r\nthought more eligible. Joli was called, and looked for in vain under\r\nsofa, and chairs, and behind mamma’s harp. While Pauline went in search\r\nof him, Julien interrupted papa to know why his bird-organ would buy\r\nvery little bread, when it had once cost so much money.\r\n\r\n“Money enough, papa, to buy many loaves of bread.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear; because the men who made that organ ate up several loaves\r\nof bread while they were at work upon it; and it was necessary to pay\r\nthemselves for that bread, as well as for the wood, and the steel, and\r\nthe brass, and the wear of their tools.”\r\n\r\n“Then would not people eat as much bread if they made another bird-organ\r\nto-day?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and such an organ would cost me twice as much money as I gave for\r\nyours last year. It would buy only the same number of loaves, however,\r\nbecause each loaf costs twice as much money as it used to do.”\r\n\r\n“But grandpapa says my organ will buy very little bread.”\r\n\r\n“True; because it was made when bread was cheap; and an organ made\r\nto-day would be made when bread is very dear. I gave the organ-maker\r\nmoney enough to buy twelve loaves; and now the same money would buy only\r\nsix loaves.”\r\n\r\n“And perhaps six loaves would not be enough for the people while they\r\nwere making the organ?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not. They must have twelve; and so I should have to pay twice\r\nas much for another organ made to-day as you could sell yours for,\r\nsupposing it as good as new.”\r\n\r\n“But why is not there more bread, papa? I should like that there should\r\nbe so much that I might give the people twenty-four loaves when I give\r\nthe king my organ.”\r\n\r\n“When that time comes, my dear, the people will not want to beg bread,\r\nand you shall have a better present to offer at court.—But, do you know,\r\nJulien, there is going to be less bread than ever, I am afraid.”\r\n\r\nMarguerite drew her little son to her, and described to him the state of\r\nthe peasantry round uncle Antoine’s vineyards; and how grandpapa’s\r\nolives were all blown down, and everything eatable destroyed, except\r\nwhat had hitherto been considered food for swine.\r\n\r\n“One woman,” she continued, “offered a comfortable coat of her husband’s\r\nto several shivering people who would have liked it very much; but they\r\ncould not give so much as a single handful of barley for it. There were\r\nsome who would have given a whole field for a sack of wheat; but they\r\ncould not get it.”\r\n\r\n“One miserly person,” observed Charles, “happened to save a small stock\r\nof cabbages, of which he was willing to sell three. He was offered a\r\nblanket, and would not take it; and then a pretty crucifix; and then a\r\nclock——”\r\n\r\n“But perhaps he did not want any of these things?”\r\n\r\n“Neither could he be said to want what he took at last. When he found\r\nthat the highest price was offered that he was likely to get, he\r\naccepted it; and it was a diamond pin, given by lady Alice de Thou to a\r\ndestitute family.”\r\n\r\n“Was it like the diamond in mamma’s watch?”\r\n\r\n“Much larger. It was so valuable that, a month ago, it would have bought\r\nuncle Antoine’s best vineyard.—It bought only three cabbages now,\r\nbecause the people must have cabbages and did not want diamonds.”\r\n\r\n“Then the very poor people pay much more than the rich, I suppose? The\r\npoorer they are, the more they pay?”\r\n\r\n“Not when there is enough of what they want. The baker over the way\r\nknows that if he charged a poor man too high, the man would go to some\r\nother baker to buy; so they keep their prices pretty equal. But as soon\r\nas there is too little of what everybody wants, every one is eager to\r\nget his share, and promises more than his neighbour; till, as we see, a\r\ndiamond pin may be given for three cabbages. There is too little corn in\r\nFrance now; and that is the reason why we give more for it than will pay\r\nthe baker, and the miller, and the farmer, and his labourers for what it\r\ncost them to prepare it for us.”\r\n\r\n“The same will be the case with your papa’s wine,” added Marguerite. “He\r\ncharged yesterday as much as it had cost him to cultivate the ground,\r\nand ripen the wine, and pay for having it brought here, and for the use\r\nof his cellars, and a certain sum over for us to live upon. After\r\nto-day, everybody will know how the storm has ruined the vineyards;\r\nevery one will be afraid that there will not be wine enough, and they\r\nwill offer more and more for it, till—”\r\n\r\n“Till papa is rich enough to take Pauline and me to Versailles, to see\r\nthe court.”\r\n\r\nCharles told how much money he should want to get his vineyards into\r\nrepair again, and what high wages he must pay the country people, while\r\nprovisions continued as dear as at present.—Marguerite meanwhile sighed,\r\nand observed that there was little pleasure now in going to Versailles,\r\nto hear people, even of the better classes, criticise the expensiveness\r\nof the queen’s dress, and the haughtiness of her air, as often as she\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nPauline now burst into the room in a state of wonder and consternation.\r\nShe had not been able to find Joli anywhere about the house, and on\r\nemploying the servants in the search, had recovered her favourite in a\r\nsomewhat different condition from that in which she had last seen him.\r\nHe was found crouching in the street, just outside the door, no longer\r\nthe beautiful animal, with a silky white coat, enamelled collar and\r\nsilver bell, but actually dyed, the hind part red, the fore part blue,\r\nwith a stripe of white left in the middle. Instead of the collar, were\r\nbands of ribbon of the same three colours. The poor animal and its\r\nmistress seemed equally terrified, and both perhaps felt themselves\r\ninsulted when everybody laughed. Pauline cried, and Joli whined.\r\n\r\n“Is he hurt, my love?” inquired mamma.\r\n\r\nJulien waved his handkerchief, and Joli jumped and snapped at it as\r\nusual; and even Pauline laughed through her tears, when she saw the\r\ngaudy little creature frisking about in masquerade.\r\n\r\n“Since he is safe,” said Charles, “never mind the collar and bell. We\r\nwill get another when times are better, and there are fewer thieves\r\nabout.”\r\n\r\n“There is something worse than theft here,” observed Marguerite, sadly.\r\n“I abhor those colours.”\r\n\r\n“Then let us wash them off, if we can; and mind, Pauline, if you wish\r\nyour dog to be safe, you must keep him within doors till his coat is\r\nperfectly white again.”\r\n\r\nThe washing availed little, as the dog was not besmeared but dyed. To\r\nget rid of as much red and blue as possible, mamma cut off the new\r\ncollar, and gave Pauline a piece of white satin ribbon. Grandpapa helped\r\nthe child to tie it on, and sent her also for a white lily,—his\r\nfavourite flower,—and fastened it where the bell had been; and then Joli\r\nlooked something like a royalist dog again.\r\n\r\n“I do wonder, Charles,” said his wife, while this was doing, “that you\r\ngo on always talking of better times coming, and of the fine things that\r\nare to happen by and by. You have done so ever since I knew you; ever\r\nsince——”\r\n\r\n“Yes, love, ever since the days when you were so very sure that your\r\nfather would never approve me; that my business would never flourish;\r\nthat, for one reason or another, we should never come together.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! I was not a cool judge in that case.”\r\n\r\n“Nor I, I am sure, my dear.”\r\n\r\n“You seldom are, if there is any room at all for hope. Plunge you into\r\nan abyss of distress, and you are the calmest of judges. I would trust\r\nyou to find your way in utter darkness; but the least glimmering you\r\ntake for daylight. At this very moment, when you know that all affairs\r\nhave been looking more and more gloomy for these ten years past; when\r\nthe people are starving and rebellious, when your trade is almost\r\nannihilated, and my dowry destroyed, with that of thousands of your\r\nneighbours, you still talk of the good times that are coming.”\r\n\r\n“You think this very senseless, my love, I dare say?”\r\n\r\n“It _is_ very provoking, Charles. At first it was always said in the\r\nspring that things would be better in the autumn; and in the autumn,\r\nthat all would come right in the spring. Now, you have somewhat extended\r\nyour hope: it is either next year, or by and by, or hereafter; but still\r\nyou go on hoping, when everybody else is preparing.”\r\n\r\n“Cannot one hope and prepare at the same time?” asked Charles. “It seems\r\nto me that it is for want of this that so much evil now threatens us.\r\nThe court goes on hoping without making any preparation; and the people,\r\nhaving no hope from the present system, are preparing to overthrow it\r\ntoo completely and too suddenly.”\r\n\r\n“Mercy!” cried Marguerite; “what will become of us?”\r\n\r\n“We shall live to grow wise in the experience of a state of transition,\r\nor die, leaving this wisdom to be inherited by others. In either case,\r\nthe wisdom will remain; and the world (including our children) will be\r\nthe better for it. Meanwhile, there is dinner waiting below for those\r\nwho are hungry. Do not let the thoughts of to-morrow spoil the comfort\r\nof to-day.”\r\n\r\nBefore the day was over, however, its comfort was spoiled, and even\r\nCharles was compelled to look anxiously to the morrow. After dinner, a\r\nshriek of anguish was heard from the children. They had forgotten to\r\nsecure Joli; and he was found hung up on the next lamp-post, strangled\r\nin his new white collar, and the lily stuck insultingly in his mouth.\r\nThere was no use now in blaming the folly and carelessness which had\r\noccasioned the catastrophe. The only thing to be done was to impress\r\nupon the entire household the necessity of parading no more lilies, and\r\navoiding all ornaments of white, red, or blue.\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                        THE TEMPER OF THE TIME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stagnation of trade was now a serious evil to Charles, not only as\r\nit occasioned his capital to be locked up, and his income to be\r\nimpaired, nor because he was of so active a temperament that nothing\r\ntroubled him like the having no business to do,—but because those were\r\nthe safest amidst the troubles of the times who were supposed to be\r\nfully occupied in their private concerns. There was no lack of interest,\r\nindeed, for the most restless seeker of excitement; and Charles might\r\nhave busied himself from morning to night of every day in tracking the\r\nprogress of the public discontent, if such had been the species of\r\nemployment he had desired or approved. He might, like other people, have\r\nshouted the praises of Necker in every street and square. He might have\r\namused himself with watching with how many different airs the passengers\r\non the Pont Neuf submitted to bow uncovered before the statue of Henry\r\nIV., under the penalty of having squibs let off in their faces. He might\r\nhave witnessed the burning in effigy of obnoxious ministers, and have\r\nstood by the great fire into which the king’s decrees for suspending the\r\nparliament were cast, and have listened, through the live-long day, to\r\nthe harangues of popular orators, or joined in the midnight processions\r\nby which the repose of all quiet citizens was disturbed. But Charles did\r\nnot see that such attendance on his part could do any good at present,\r\nhowever the case might hereafter be altered. Whether or not he was\r\nturning over in his mind plans for his conduct when the time should come\r\nfor him to act, he now appeared to direct his attention to private\r\naffairs, and talked more of wine and olives than of political matters.\r\n\r\nHe had been accustomed to furnish a large proportion of the home supply\r\nof olives and almonds for which there was a demand in Paris, from the\r\nproduce of the estates of his wife and father-in-law; and now he had\r\napplications, day after day, for fruits which he might have sold at a\r\nhigh price, while scarcely a customer came for wine. He had already\r\ninvested the little floating capital he could spare from the restoration\r\nof his vineyards in fruits from Italy and the Levant, which his brother\r\npurchased for him as they came up the great canal and the Garonne, on\r\ntheir way to Bordeaux. He now began to wish that he could exchange a\r\npart of his large stock of wine for fruits. He knew that wines would\r\nrise enormously in price, as soon as the demand should revive; but\r\nfruits had already risen enormously, and he wished to turn some of his\r\ncapital into money by their means. It was easy to do this by extending\r\nhis transactions with Steele, who purchased fruit in large quantities at\r\nBordeaux to send to England. The demand for fruit in London being at\r\npresent insignificant in comparison with that for claret, and the direct\r\nreverse being the case at Paris, it was Steele’s interest to transmit\r\nmore wine and less fruit, and Charles’s to take fruit in exchange for\r\nhis wine. It was therefore settled that, in addition to their standing\r\nbargain for first-rate wine, Steele should have a large choice of\r\nsecond-rate claret, in payment for chestnuts from Spain, oranges and\r\ncitrons from the Madeiras, olives from the Levant, and almonds from\r\nItaly. The terms of exchange were the only difficulty.\r\n\r\nNeither Steele nor Charles were speculators, in the common sense of the\r\nterm. They were prudent men of business, attached to one line of\r\noccupation, and in no particular hurry to be richer than everybody else.\r\nThey now, however, found themselves obliged to speculate, and became\r\nmore fully aware than they had been before that all trading for purposes\r\nof sale is, in fact, speculation. It is necessary for traders not only\r\nto take into account all the past and present circumstances which affect\r\nthe value of the article in which they deal, but to look forward to such\r\nas may influence its sale. Their success depends on the foresight which\r\nthey have exercised, and the sagacity with which they have calculated:\r\nin other words, on their skill in speculation. When they extend their\r\nviews to a further extent than they can command, and found their\r\ncalculations on contingencies, they become gamesters of that class which\r\nis held in horror under the name of speculators: and hence arises a\r\nsomewhat indistinct dread and dislike of all speculation; while the fact\r\nis, no exchange whatever could go on without more or less real\r\nspeculation. The farmer must speculate on the seasons; the manufacturer\r\non tastes and fashions, and on the supply of raw material; the merchant\r\nmust speculate on war and peace, and all domestic and much foreign\r\npolicy. In ordinary times, Charles must speculate on the increase or\r\ndecline of the taste for claret, or of the number of claret-drinkers in\r\nParis; and now, a new and wide field of calculation was opened before\r\nhim, on which he must enter if he meant to prosecute his business at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nFrom the time that the brothers had entered into business till now,\r\nthere had been established a tolerably steady rate of understood value,\r\nat which goods had been exchanged for one another. There had been\r\noccasional and slight variations, according to seasons, and other\r\nfluctuating circumstances; so that four pipes of wine might at one time\r\nexchange for the same quantity of fruit as three and a half would buy at\r\nanother; but the circumstances which determined these variations in\r\nvalue being usually foreseen by all parties concerned, their vigilance\r\nprevented any very sudden and perplexing convulsions in trade. As long\r\nas there were average seasons, an average supply of food, an average\r\nquantity of labour to be had, wages and profits (on which price depends)\r\ncould be calculated, and relied on for remaining nearly at the average\r\nrate. But now, there had been both natural and political disasters,\r\nwhose consequences defied all calculation. There was an over-supply of\r\nlabour,—as far as the number of labourers went; for thousands of the\r\npeasantry had been stripped of all they had, and rendered dependent on\r\nneighbouring capitalists for employment and support. At the same time,\r\nfood was dreadfully deficient, and therefore enormously dear; so that to\r\nwhat price labour would rise, in spite of the over-supply, it was\r\nimpossible to guess.—The same cause rendered the amount of profits\r\nuncertain. Unless it could be settled how much the labourers would\r\nappropriate, it must continue unsettled how much would remain over for\r\nthe capitalist,—even if it could be ascertained how extensive would be\r\nthe demand for the article. This, again, was doubtful, from the\r\nuncertainty of political affairs, which impaired the security of\r\nproperty, and stopped up the channels of mutual exchange. Thus, not only\r\nwas the permanent original element of exchangeable value,—cost of\r\nproduction,—rendered incalculable, in the case both of wine and fruits,\r\nbut all the causes which occasion temporary fluctuations were violently\r\nat work; and it required a clear head and a strong heart to anticipate\r\nand rely upon their issues. Steele’s part was the less perplexing of the\r\ntwo. He knew no more than Charles, it is true, how the sudden rise in\r\nthe value of labour, from the scarcity of food, would affect the price\r\nof the stock laid in before labour became so dear; and he could not\r\ntherefore judge of the probable amount of Charles’s profits; but on the\r\nhead of his employers’ profits he felt very secure. The English market\r\nwas steady: the demand could be nearly estimated, and if it was pretty\r\nsure to be good with an abundant supply of wine in the market, it was\r\ncertain to be very brisk as soon as the supply was known to be\r\ndeficient. Though, therefore, he might ask less than he need in exchange\r\nfor his fruit, there was every probability of his gaining more than the\r\nusual profit on the wine thus purchased.—Charles, on the other hand, had\r\nnot only to discover what expense his brother and other vine-growers\r\nwere at in maintaining labourers, and how much of this was to be charged\r\nby tacit agreement upon their present stock, and the same facts with\r\nregard to the fruit; but to speculate on the ability and disposition of\r\nthe people of Paris to buy either wine or fruit, and how much the demand\r\nfor the one was likely to fall short of, or exceed, the demand for the\r\nother.—The result was that the two parties to the bargain fixed upon an\r\nexchange which appeared likely to be mutually advantageous, but which\r\nproved the value of their commodities to have deviated widely from the\r\nordinary proportion. Setting off an equal expense of labour, and an\r\nequal amount of profit, on each side, fifty chests of fruit (from\r\nalmonds and citrons down to chestnuts) would exchange for a pipe of\r\nclaret, in ordinary times. Now, twenty chests were all that such a pipe\r\nwould buy; and yet Charles believed he had made a good bargain, as the\r\ndemand of thirsty orators for juicy fruits, and of loungers in the\r\nstreets for chestnuts, was extraordinarily great, while wine was, just\r\nthen, little in request. His wife, knowing that he had lately been\r\nrather pressed for money, watched with interest the process by which it\r\nbegan once more to flow in. By half emptying a cellar in Bordeaux, fruit\r\nwas made to arrive in Paris by waggon loads, and these were presently\r\nconverted into cash. But there was one point on which she was not\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n“I see,” said she, “the convenience to us and to the Englishmen of our\r\nmutual exchange. It is really charming; as welcome as the traffic\r\nbetween the first maker of weapons and the hunter, when the one had more\r\nbows and fishlines than he could use, and the other more venison and\r\ntrout than he could eat while they were good. But, Charles, are you\r\neither of you just in taking advantage of the vengeance of heaven, he to\r\nenrich himself, and you to repair your losses? Ought you not to sell\r\nwine at the price it professed to bear in your cellars before the\r\nhurricane happened? And why is Italian fruit dear, when in Italy there\r\nhas been no storm?”\r\n\r\n“If we sold our goods at last year’s prices,” replied Charles, “all our\r\nwine and our fruit would be exhausted long before we should have a\r\nfurther supply. Is it not better that they should bear such a price as\r\nwill make people sparing in their use till we have once more an\r\nabundance?”\r\n\r\n“And is this the reason why there are granaries not yet exhausted,\r\namidst the cries of the people for bread?”\r\n\r\n“It is; and if bread had borne its usual price all this time, there\r\nwould now be absolute famine in every street of Paris. If the people\r\nunderstood this, they would not storm the flour mills, and throw\r\nhundreds of sacks into the Seine, in their rage against the owners.\r\nThese owners, by causing a gradual distribution, are the best friends of\r\nthose who are their own bitter enemies;—who waste bread now, because\r\nthey were not permitted to waste it before.”\r\n\r\n“But why should the corn-owners be enriched by scarcity of bread, and\r\nyou by the destruction of vineyards? You tell me that your gains by this\r\nstorm will nearly compensate the losses it has cost you. Is this fair?”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly so. You know that the value of every thing that is exchanged\r\ndepends on the labour required to produce it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes: and therefore the wine that is to be grown in your desolated\r\nvineyards will justly be dear, because much and dear labour will be\r\nneeded to restore your estates to fertility. But I speak of your present\r\nstock, prepared when labour was not particularly high priced, and when\r\nonly the ordinary quantity of it was wanted.”\r\n\r\n“The plain fact is, that labour is now very dear, everywhere; my\r\ncellar-full of it, as well as that which is now active in La Favorite.\r\nYou will hardly wish, my dear, that I should present the public with a\r\nportion of it, in the present state of my affairs. I am not exactly in a\r\ncondition to give away my substance unnecessarily; especially to buyers\r\nof wine, who are, for the most part, richer than myself. If harps were\r\nsuddenly to become doubled in value, you would not sell yours for what\r\nyou gave for it, would you?”\r\n\r\n“No; harp-buyers would be better able to give the market-price than I to\r\ndo without it. Yet——”\r\n\r\n“Yet we have not considered that your case would be stronger still if it\r\nwas necessary for you to buy another harp immediately, at the advanced\r\nprice. Such is my case. I sell my cellar-full of labour in order to\r\npurchase a further supply at the present high price. Since I must buy,\r\nand must pay dear for what I buy, would it not be folly to sell the same\r\narticle cheap?”\r\n\r\n“The same article! I do not understand you. You would be wrong to hire\r\nyourself out for the money wages of a year ago:—to give the strength of\r\nyour arm for what would buy much less bread: but——”\r\n\r\n“But the wine in my cellars and the strength of my arm are equally\r\nlabour, possessed by me. You may call the one primary, and the other\r\nsecondary, if you like; but they are equally labour. Yes; all the\r\ncapital we have,—whether the furniture of this room, or your olive\r\npresses, or my wine, is hoarded labour: the labour of the work-people\r\nfrom whom we purchased it.”\r\n\r\n“That is curious. Then the price depends upon the labour——O no, there\r\nare your profits to be considered. The price depends upon the cost of\r\nproduction; which includes your capital as well as your men’s labour.”\r\n\r\n“Call it all labour at once, if you like. Profits are the recompense of\r\nlabour as much as wages: wages of primary, and profits of secondary or\r\nhoarded labour; whichever you please to call it.”\r\n\r\n“Then why have you been perplexing yourself all this time about this\r\nexchange of goods with Steele? Cannot you reckon easily enough the\r\npresent value of the labour contained in a pipe of wine? and will not\r\nthis serve as a perfect measure?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing ever served as a perfect measure of value yet; or ever will, in\r\nmy opinion,” replied Charles. “Labour _regulates_ the relative value of\r\nSteele’s fruit and my wine; but it can never _measure_ the one against\r\nthe other, or both against houses, or furniture, or money, or any other\r\ncommodity. Do not you see that, while labour varies as it does, it can\r\nnever serve as a measure?”\r\n\r\n“To be sure, it is very different in its value this winter from what it\r\nwas the last.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose our milk-woman exchanged a quart of cream daily for a pint of\r\ncoffee, at the coffee-shop opposite; and that the quart and pint pots\r\ngrew larger or smaller according as the air was damp or dry. These pots\r\nwould regulate the quantity of cream and coffee; but it would be absurd\r\nto call them measures, while the quantity they yield is incessantly\r\nvarying.”\r\n\r\n“Labour is affected by the seasons, I know; and it seems as if it must\r\nalways be so, and as if there could therefore never be a fixed measure\r\nof value.”\r\n\r\n“Not only does primary labour produce more at some times, and under some\r\ncircumstances, than others, but it is impossible to tell beforehand what\r\nwill be the return to secondary labour; and from this it follows that\r\nthe shares of the capitalist and the labourer rise and fall against one\r\nanother, so that neither can be depended upon for steadiness.”\r\n\r\n“Well: I suppose we can do without a fixed measure of value, since we\r\ncannot get one; but it does seem as if it would be convenient to know\r\nalways exactly how much food and clothing one might have in exchange for\r\nso much money.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid it would be as mischievous in one way as having no\r\nregulator would be in another.”\r\n\r\n“O, if there were no regulator, men would snatch from one another like\r\nwild beasts; and they would soon be in a very beast-like state as to\r\nproperty. Food for the hour would be all any one would think of, if the\r\nchances were that he would get nothing by his labour, or be unable to\r\nkeep what he might obtain.”\r\n\r\n“On the other hand, if there were an unvarying measure, men would be a\r\nwholly different race from what they are created to be. There is no\r\nanticipating the consequences of withdrawing all the discipline by which\r\ntheir faculties are exercised, sharpened, and strengthened. The very\r\nsupposition is absurd, however, for it includes the absence of all human\r\nvicissitudes. Before there could be a true measure of the relative value\r\nof human possessions, man must have power to keep the whole surface of\r\nthe globe in a state of equal fertility, to regulate the sunshine and\r\nthe rain, and to ordain all who are born to have an equal share of\r\nstrength, both of limbs and faculties. All lives must also be of the\r\nsame length, and even sickness would affect his measure. No: that degree\r\nof sagacity which can abstract averages is enough of a guide for\r\npractical purposes, while it affords a fine exercise for the intellect\r\nand the moral nature of man.”\r\n\r\nMarguerite shook her head mournfully, asking how much the moral nature\r\nof their neighbours was likely to be benefited by the present\r\nuncertainty of affairs.\r\n\r\n“Infinitely more than we can estimate,” replied Charles, eagerly. “I see\r\nevery day, not only splendid instances of intellectual effort, applied\r\nto the most important departments of social philosophy, but moral\r\nstruggles and self-sacrifices which dispose me more than ever to bow the\r\nknee to human nature.”\r\n\r\n“And, as usual, you overlook whatever would not please you. You hear the\r\npatriotic harangues of our new mob orators, but not the abominable\r\ncommentaries of those who stand at your elbow. You join in the shouts\r\nwith which the national colours are hailed as often as they appear, but\r\nare not aware how the white cockade is trodden under foot. You are so\r\ntaken up with making your obeisance to the parliament you think so\r\nvirtuous, that you disregard the cruel irreverence with which our\r\nanointed sovereigns are blasphemed. This is not just, Charles; it is\r\nfoolish; and, what is worse, it is disloyal.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, my love——”\r\n\r\n“It is not enough that, by your way of regarding public affairs, you\r\namuse my father, and tranquillize me, and encourage in our children a\r\ntemper like your own. All this is well in ordinary times: but these are\r\ndays for higher objects and a more intrepid conduct.”\r\n\r\nCharles looked steadily at his wife, but she would not yet let him\r\nspeak. She went on,—\r\n\r\n“These are days when the true should pray day and night for vengeance on\r\nthe false, instead of excusing them: when loyalty should weep in dark\r\ncorners, since it cannot show its face in the daylight without being\r\nprofaned. These are days when our children should see a solemn sadness\r\nin our countenances; and if they ask why, they should be told in\r\nmournful mystery what sympathy is due to suffering royalty.”\r\n\r\n“And not to a suffering nation, Marguerite? Is there to be no pride in\r\nintrepid patriotism? No joy in public virtue? Shall the birth of liberty\r\nbe looked upon as an evil omen? If the king had chosen to stand its\r\nsponsor, the whole of our mighty people might have peaceably rejoiced\r\ntogether. His disowning it is no reason why others should not hail its\r\nadvent. His choosing the part of Herod is reason enough why there should\r\nbe priests waiting and watching in the temple.”\r\n\r\n“You are speaking treason!” cried the terrified Marguerite.\r\n\r\n“By no means. I am ready to struggle for the king and the throne till\r\ndeath; but it must be for a wise king, and a throne founded in justice.\r\nAs it is, all things are made to bear two aspects, and it is too much to\r\nrequire all to perceive only one. A forcible division has been made\r\nbetween the past and the future, and no wonder that some incline to look\r\nforward, while others persist in a reverted attitude.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! how will you reconcile duties in this perverse state of affairs?”\r\n\r\n“Very easily. When I am in the mob, I refer the patriotic sentiments of\r\nthe orators to the new era of freedom, and pity the indecent violence of\r\nthe hearers as the result of their prolonged subjugation. When heads are\r\nuncovered before La Fayette, my heart glows as in the very presence of\r\nliberty; when the queen is insulted in the streets of her capital by the\r\nrefuse of her own sex, I sigh over the mischiefs the oppression of ages\r\nhas wrought, but still hope that the day of their decline has arrived.”\r\n\r\n“And what when Orleans sneaks away from the rabble he has maddened? What\r\nwhen every lamp-post in the Place de Grêve bears its strangled victim?”\r\n\r\n“I see in one the monstrous offspring of a deformed and an unformed\r\nsystem. Such a birth can take place but once, and its life must be as\r\nbrief through want of vigour, as it is hateful from its ugliness. The\r\npractice of slaughter too belongs to the old time. The more degraded\r\nslaves are, the more certain is it that their emancipation will be\r\nsignalized by murder.”\r\n\r\n“Why then not control, or at least resist them? Is it not dastardly to\r\nsit smiling at home, while the loyal and the noble——”\r\n\r\nCharles lifted up his finger in token of silence, and rose from his\r\nseat, saying,\r\n\r\n“Your reproaches impel me to a confidence with which I did not intend to\r\ndisturb your tranquillity. Follow me.”\r\n\r\nMarguerite did so, suspecting that she might soon wish to retract some\r\nthings which she had said. Her husband led her to his wine-cellars,\r\nwhich were at the back of the house, separated from it by a small court,\r\nfrom which there was an opening through a wide gateway into the street.\r\nThe few servants who remained at this slack time on the premises were\r\nemployed about the fruit-store. The keys of the wine-cellars were kept\r\nby a confidential clerk, who was always on the spot, and was the only\r\nperson besides Charles who now ever entered the place.\r\n\r\n“Remember,” said Charles to his wife, as he put the key into the first\r\nlock; “remember that you have brought this disclosure upon yourself.\r\nThis will enable you to bear it well. The best thing we can hope is that\r\nyou may have to bear it long. If calamity should shortly release you\r\nfrom apprehension, you will see that the hopefulness you complain of in\r\nme does not arise from levity. Pierre, bring the lantern, and lock us\r\nin.”\r\n\r\nMarguerite felt half-stifled between her fear of what was to come next,\r\nand the close air of the cellars. Her husband held up the light, and she\r\nsaw that the door had been newly plated with iron. The next thing she\r\nwas shown was a long train of gunpowder winding among the stores of wine\r\nand brandy.\r\n\r\n“O, Charles!” she cried; “are you going to blow us up?”\r\n\r\n“Not ourselves, or the house either,” he replied. “You see here is not\r\nenough to do any great mischief;—only enough to bring down the ceiling\r\nupon my wine-casks, and spoil the wine. There are no buildings over this\r\ncellar, you know; so there is no danger to human life.”\r\n\r\nHe then explained that, finding how invariably the worst excesses of the\r\nmob were to be traced to their being plied with drink, it had occurred\r\nto him to engage all the wine-merchants of Paris in an agreement to\r\nrefuse, on some pretence or other, to sell wine or spirits to any but\r\nprivate gentlemen who wanted it for their own consumption. Some agreed,\r\nand others did not; and these latter, when they had sold all their\r\nstock, and could, from the scarcity, get no more, had maliciously\r\nwhispered in the mobs the secret with which they had been entrusted. One\r\nafter another of the merchants, knowing the danger to which they were\r\nexposed, had fallen off from the agreement; and Charles, whose stock was\r\nthe largest now remaining in the city, was left almost alone in his\r\ndetermination to refuse the means of intoxicating the mob. He was aware\r\nthat his wine was longed for, and his life threatened. He could not\r\nremove his stock to a distance, for his premises were evidently watched\r\nby spies. He had reason to believe that, on the first occasion when the\r\npeople were to be excited to an extraordinary act of violence, they were\r\nto be brought hither to burst open his stores, and be plied with brandy\r\nand wine. He did not choose to be thus made the means of promoting riot\r\nand murder, and determined on blowing up his stock, if matters came to\r\nextremity. On the first alarm of the approach of a mob, he should fire\r\nthe train, and bring down the roof; making a pit of what was now level\r\nground. Or, if he should be absent, Pierre knew how to do it.\r\n\r\n“But how?” asked Marguerite, with as much voice as she had left. “Must\r\nit not be fatal to the one who fires?”\r\n\r\n“I trust not,” he replied; “though, if it were, my purpose would stand.\r\nIt is better to sacrifice one life thus, than to make murderous fiends\r\nof many thousands. But, look here, this is our contrivance.”\r\n\r\nAnd he showed her how a very small trap-door had been made of one of the\r\nstones in the pavement above, through which a light might be let down\r\nimmediately upon the train, and from any distance, if the line were of\r\nsufficient length.\r\n\r\n“It is but little that a quiet citizen can do in times when men of a\r\ndifferent make are sure to gain the ascendency,” observed Charles: “but\r\nno one is absolved from doing what he can. I am no orator to rouse the\r\npeople to patriotism, or to soothe their madness; but here I have power\r\nin having something like a monopoly of the poison which helps to madden\r\nthem; and it shall be kept from inflaming their brains, whether they\r\ntear me limb from limb, or compel me to drown myself in my own wine, or\r\nlet me live till the days when they shall thank me for crossing their\r\nwill.”\r\n\r\nMarguerite’s terror was aggravated by a sense of shame for having failed\r\nto anticipate her husband’s heroism, and being now unable to share it.\r\nHer thoughts were ready to veer any way in hope of escape, rather than\r\nanchor themselves upon her husband’s determination, and await the event.\r\nNo wonder, since she had so much at stake, and was a very simpleton in\r\npolitical matters. She had all possible fears, and no wishes. A\r\nmiserable state to be in, in such times!\r\n\r\nCould not the whole family remove? Could not her husband, at least, slip\r\naway by night? Must they remain in the neighbourhood of gunpowder, and\r\nin daily expectation of the mob?—actually within hearing of the hated\r\ndrums?\r\n\r\nThey must; her husband replied. Any attempt to fly, or to alter their\r\nmanner of living, would be immediately detected, and would bring a worse\r\ndestruction than that which they might possibly escape by remaining. Had\r\nnot Marguerite observed spies about the house?\r\n\r\nO yes: every day since poor Joli was found hanged. That was a sad piece\r\nof carelessness. Charles thought so too, and even with more reason than\r\nhis wife. He knew that the dressing up of that dog was set down in the\r\nlist of his sins against his country. If it had taken place eighteen\r\nmonths later, it would have brought upon him an immediate sentence of\r\ndeath: but matters not having yet gone so far as they were destined to\r\nproceed, the fact was only recorded against him.\r\n\r\n“Let us go,” said Marguerite, faintly, when she found her husband bent\r\non adhering to his plans, for reasons which she could not gainsay. “I\r\ncannot bear the air of this place.”\r\n\r\n“We will go presently, love,” replied Charles. “The first moment that I\r\nsee you look like yourself, I will call to Pierre to unlock the door.\r\nMeanwhile, here is a seat; and I will give you air and something to\r\nrevive you.”\r\n\r\nHaving seated her where a breath of fresh air from the little trap-door\r\nmight blow upon her face, he brought a flask of rich wine, in a full\r\nglass of which he pledged her, assuring her, with a smile, that it did\r\nnot yet taste of gunpowder. His pledge was,—\r\n\r\n“Marguerite, my wife,—life and safety to ourselves and our household! If\r\nnot these,—at least the peace of our enlightened and steadfast\r\nwill!—Will you not pledge me?”\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head upon his shoulder, and wept her shame at being\r\nunworthy of him,—unfit to live in such times.\r\n\r\n“Then preserve yourself, love, to live in better times. They will come;\r\nthey must come; and steady hopefulness will be our best security till\r\nthey arrive.”\r\n\r\nMarguerite so far succeeded in her endeavour to adopt her husband’s\r\nprinciple, that she returned with a smile the searching gaze which\r\nPierre fixed upon her as she issued from the cellar: but her countenance\r\nfell at the first words with which he answered her intimation that she\r\nnow knew the great secret, and would guard it carefully.\r\n\r\n“Alas! Madame. I fear it has ceased to be a secret——That is,” he added,\r\nchanging his tone when he perceived her alarm,—“our men yonder cannot\r\nbut observe how carefully we keep the place locked, and how many\r\ncustomers we send away; and nothing escapes suspicion in these times.\r\nBut your having been down is a happy circumstance, Madame; especially as\r\nyou emerge with an air so charmingly serene.”\r\n\r\nThis hint to look composed was not lost upon the lady, who tripped\r\nacross the court with a demeanour of assumed gaiety. It presently\r\nvanished; and she looked with astonishment on her husband when at play\r\nwith the children after dinner. It rent her heart to hear her father\r\ninquire perpetually how early in the spring they should set out for\r\nGuienne, that he might delight himself in his beloved olive-groves once\r\nmore, with the children by his side: but Charles answered as if there\r\nhad still been olive-groves; and as if the family were at liberty to go\r\nwhither they pleased in their beautiful country. When, at intervals, she\r\nsaw him whipping his little girl’s wooden horse, and practising\r\nbattledore with his young son, laughing all the while as merrily as\r\neither, she could scarcely believe him to be the same who had so lately\r\nsolemnly pledged her over a train of gunpowder laid by his own resolute\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                           DEEDS OF THE TIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Raucourt had abundance of leisure to repeat his question about\r\njourneying southwards, and to describe to his grandchildren the wealth\r\nof fruit-grounds that they would inherit from him. Month after month, as\r\nthe days grew longer, and the weather became hotter, he told them that,\r\nwhen spring came, they should go with him to groves where pink blossoms\r\ncame out before the green leaves, and where the young oranges grew more\r\ngolden amidst the verdure as the season drew on.\r\n\r\n“But, grandpapa,” objected Julien, “the spring is going away very fast\r\nalready.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! well, then, we shall be too late for the almond blossoms, but the\r\noranges and the grapes will be all the more beautiful.”\r\n\r\n“But,” observed Pauline, when two more months had passed away, “the\r\nvintage will be all over now before we can get there, mamma says.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear, but there is a spring every year, and I am talking of\r\nnext spring.”\r\n\r\nAnd so the matter was settled for this year. Marguerite began to hope\r\nthat the affair of the cellars would be so likewise, as Charles had of\r\nlate been less importuned to sell, and there had been no fresh\r\nevidences, amidst the increasing discontents of the people, that he was\r\nheld in suspicion. There was even a hope of removing a large part of his\r\nstock openly and safely. Steele wanted more wine, and Antoine, having\r\nnone left at Bordeaux, referred him to his brother; and the Englishman\r\narrived in Paris to see whether he could enter into another negociation\r\nwith the house with which he had already dealt so extensively. He took\r\nup his abode in Charles’s house, and consulted with him, and also with\r\nsome of the authorities of the city, as to the best mode of removing his\r\npurchases, without exciting the rage of the mob, who by this time had\r\ntaken upon themselves to decide the right and wrong of all matters that\r\npassed before their eyes, whether of the nature of public or private\r\nbusiness. The magistrates, who politicly adopted the tone of the people\r\nas often as they could, sighed over the anomaly of a foreigner\r\npurchasing wine in Paris, while there was too little left for Frenchmen;\r\nand Steele wondered as emphatically at the state of affairs which\r\nobliged two merchants to call in the interference of the magistracy to\r\nrepel that of the mob, while they settled their private bargains.\r\nMarguerite thought little of the one anomaly or the other, in her strong\r\nwish to have her husband’s cellars emptied at all events. The greatest\r\nhappiness she could imagine was that of helping him and Pierre to sweep\r\naway the gunpowder, and throw open the doors of the vacant place to any\r\none who chose to enter. There was much to be done, however, before they\r\ncould arrive at this fortunate issue.\r\n\r\nOne day, while Steele’s business was pending, a carriage drove up to the\r\ndoor, with considerable state, and the Marquis de Thou, having\r\nascertained that the wine-merchant was at home, alighted, and requested\r\nto speak with him on business. While Charles waited on him, Marguerite\r\nanxiously inquired of Steele respecting the marquis’s politics; for she\r\napprehended a snare in every transaction. She thought it strange that so\r\nstout an old royalist should have any dealings with her husband, and was\r\nnot comforted by what she learned from Steele; namely, that being forced\r\nby the hatred of his country neighbours to leave his chateau in Guienne,\r\nand take refuge in Paris in the middle of summer, he seemed disposed to\r\ntrim between the two parties, and was therefore likely to be a dangerous\r\nperson to have dealings with. Immediately on his arrival, he had\r\ncontrived to place his daughter in the queen’s train, while he kept upon\r\nterms with the duke of Orleans. Pleading to himself, and bidding lady\r\nAlice plead to the queen, if called upon, his old companionship with\r\nOrleans, he did much of the duke’s dirty work, very unconsciously, very\r\ncomplacently, and with the comfortable conviction that his loyalty\r\nremained unblemished, while he attended no public meetings, and managed\r\nto be within the palace walls whenever a popular movement was likely to\r\ntake place. While Steele was explaining what was reported of the marquis\r\nat Bordeaux, Charles appeared.\r\n\r\n“The marquis wants to make large purchases of wine,” he said. “Do you\r\nconceive he can have occasion for a fourth part of my stock for his own\r\nuse?”\r\n\r\n“His chateau is shut up,” replied Steele; “and he is not occupying his\r\nhotel in Paris. Depend upon it, he is shopping for Orleans, as usual.”\r\n\r\n“He shall not have enough to intoxicate a single bravo with,” cried\r\nCharles. “Come with me, Steele, and find some objection to every sample.\r\nClaim as much as you please, and disgust him with as much more as you\r\ncan.”\r\n\r\nPierre was called in to help, and among the three, all as solemn as\r\nhimself, the marquis was more eminently bamboozled than he had ever been\r\nbefore in his life; which is saying a great deal. He protested every\r\nsample to be better than the last, whatever might have been mixed with\r\nit by Pierre in the fetching. He made half a hundred low bows when\r\nSteele claimed all that was tolerable; and declared his admiration of\r\nCharles’s magnanimity in pointing out the defects of his own commodity.\r\nThe civility of M. Pierre also in vowing that the marquis should have no\r\nwine but the best, which was all, unhappily, sold already, was worthy of\r\nmuch acknowledgment. Being under promise, however, to purchase such and\r\nsuch quantities of wine, he must waive their polite scruples, and\r\nobviate all others by referring M. Charles Luyon to the most wealthy\r\nnobleman in the kingdom for payment. This avowal decided the matter.\r\nCharles shirked the marquis all the more speedily for his having owned\r\nthat he came from the Duke of Orleans, and the carriage conveyed away\r\nthe messenger without his errand.\r\n\r\nFrom day to day other customers came: but, as all might be traced as\r\ninstruments of the duke, they were all dismissed in the same way as the\r\nmarquis. Charles was convinced that some popular commotion was at hand.\r\nHe perceived that the truly patriotic movers in the revolution were more\r\nand more hated by Orleans, as his purposes degenerated more and more\r\nfrom the purity of theirs; and he could not restrain his indignation at\r\nthe efforts that were made to infatuate and brutalize the people, that\r\nthey might disgrace or interrupt the measures of the enlightened of\r\ntheir leaders, and bring down a nation worthy of freedom to bow the knee\r\nto one who nourished the passions of a tyrant in the coward heart of a\r\nslave. “He shall not madden the people with my wine. Whatever they do\r\nshall be done in a state of sanity, as far as I can contribute thereto,”\r\nwas still Charles’s resolution; and he declined prices on which the hand\r\nof many a brother in trade would have closed without a question. He had\r\ntoo humble an idea of his own consequence to adopt his wife’s opinion\r\nthat it was designed to attach him to the Orleans party by making him\r\nthe creditor of its chief. She was confirmed in her notion, however, by\r\na very disagreeable circumstance,—the appearance of Orleans himself;—to\r\npurchase fruit, as he declared.\r\n\r\nFrom fruit the negociation presently turned to wine, as Charles\r\nexpected; and for which he had prepared himself with a somewhat\r\ndesperate intent. Knowing the faint heart which his new customer hid\r\nunder his impudent address, he thought he might calculate on the effect\r\nwhich would be produced by a sight of his underground preparations; and\r\nhe accordingly requested his Grace, with a compliment to his well-known\r\ncondescension, to enter the cellar. As soon as they were fairly in, he\r\ncalled to Pierre to be very careful of the lantern, as a single spark\r\nmight be fatal; invited the duke, unless he objected to approach so near\r\nto the magazine, to inspect the date of a certain curious old wine;\r\nbegged to go first among the fireworks for fear of an accidental\r\nexplosion, and so forth; expatiating _con amore_ on his commodity, in\r\nthe intervals.\r\n\r\n“Bless my soul, M. Luyon!” cried the duke, “what can you mean by making\r\na fortress of your cellars? It is dangerous to set foot in them, by your\r\nown account.”\r\n\r\n“Only to those who have no business here,” replied Charles. “My man and\r\nI can tread in security.”\r\n\r\nAnd he coolly gave his reasons for rendering his wine inaccessible;\r\npointing out no party, but merely with a reference to the perpetual\r\ndanger of disturbance in the present times.\r\n\r\n“But it is absolutely a fortress,” repeated the duke. “Your door is\r\nmassive. Is there no way of escape?——I mean, no other entrance?”\r\n\r\n“None whatever,” replied Charles; and at this moment, Pierre, having set\r\ndown the lantern, slammed the plated door, and barred and crossbarred it\r\nwith a diligence which the guest by no means approved.\r\n\r\n“A fortress is perfectly harmless when in friendly hands, and unless\r\nattacked,” observed Charles. “Here are no weapons of offence, you\r\nobserve; and it is far from being my interest to blow up my stock,\r\nunless driven to it.”\r\n\r\n“Or even then,” argued the duke. “Supposing your premises were\r\nattacked,—an idle anticipation;—but supposing they were, it would answer\r\nbetter to you to have them stripped than destroyed.”\r\n\r\n“To my pocket, doubtless,” answered Charles, occupying himself with\r\nopening a flask; “but not to my conscience. If by my means a mob, or any\r\nindividual of a mob, were to be incited to party violence,—if I were so\r\ntreacherous as to allow their impulses of patriotism to be corrupted\r\ninto licentiousness,—I should feel the manliness within me melting away.\r\nI should start at shadows for the rest of my days. No, sir; perish my\r\npossessions, rather than they should go to corrupt public virtue.—Taste\r\nthis, I advise you, my lord duke.”\r\n\r\n“Do not you think the air rather close here?” asked Orleans, in his\r\nsmoothest manner. “Are not the fumes of this wine——”\r\n\r\n“And of the gunpowder, my lord? They are no doubt oppressive to those\r\nwho are unused to them. Open the door, Pierre.”\r\n\r\nThe duke found his faculty of taste more to be relied upon in the open\r\nair; and took his stand accordingly in the portal, where he stood\r\nnegociating and gossiping for an unconscionable time, till first one or\r\ntwo people appeared in the court, then more, and more still, and in an\r\ninstant the well-known drum was heard close by, and the shouts of a\r\nrabble which poured in without the slightest warning. Orleans looked as\r\nif he was going to be very angry; but Charles had no time to parley with\r\nhis hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nIt was too late to fasten the portal on the outside, and run to the\r\nhouse. Pierre’s motion was to pull the duke with them into the cellar;\r\nbut his master forbade. He thrust Orleans out of the portal, calling\r\nout,\r\n\r\n“See, we carry a light in with us; and remember you tread on hollow\r\nground,”—and retreated, not allowing even his faithful Pierre to enter\r\nthe place of danger with him. He locked, bolted, barred and double\r\nbarred the door, went and placed the lantern close by the train, looked\r\nto his matches and tinder, and then sat down, with folded arms, to await\r\nthe issue of the expected siege. He was fully resolved to sacrifice his\r\nlife and property rather than be aiding and abetting with Orleans in\r\ngiving a licentious character to the great act (whatever it might be)\r\nwhich the people were evidently contemplating. The more he had thought\r\nof the events of the preceding day, when arms had been seized and cannon\r\nlaid hold of by the people, the more convinced he had been that the\r\npresent would not pass away without being signalized by some\r\nextraordinary deed, and the more resolutely determined he felt to use\r\nsuch power as he had, for the safety and honour of the state. The fierce\r\nyells of the mob outside had no effect but to increase his courage, as\r\nthey served to justify his object to himself; and as he looked through\r\nthe dim vault, from the further end of which came the dull echo of the\r\nblows upon the door, as he observed that the one feeble light did not so\r\nmuch as flicker in the socket while all was tumult outside, he felt a\r\nthrilling consciousness of power which was not gloomy, though it was\r\nfearful, and might involve his own destruction. Whether it would involve\r\nany other life, he had considered much and long; he believed not; or\r\nthat if one or a few should be injured by the slight explosion which\r\nwould effect his purpose, this would be a less evil than would be\r\nperpetrated by a drunken mob in possession of such means of destruction\r\nas they had seized the day before.\r\n\r\nOne circumstance nearly unnerved him. He had prevented Pierre from\r\nentering with him, under the idea of saving his life from the peril in\r\nwhich his own was placed; but the sudden outcry which presently arose,\r\nthe oaths evidently directed at an individual, the cries of shrill\r\nfemale voices,—“To the lamp-post with him!”—agonized Charles with the\r\nidea that the vengeance of the mob for his opposition was to fall upon\r\nhis unfortunate servant. He felt a momentary impulse to throw open the\r\ndoor and take all the consequences, the first of which would undoubtedly\r\nbe that he would be taken to the lamp-post,——\r\n\r\n“Not instead of Pierre, but with him,” he thought, however, in another\r\nmoment. “No. I cannot save him; so I will persevere. And may heaven hold\r\nme guiltless of his blood; for I meant well towards him!—But what\r\nnow?—What a silence!—Have they sent for fire to smoke me out? I will\r\nthrow up a thicker smoke presently, if that be it.—O, what a horrible\r\ncry! What can have put them in a new rage?”\r\n\r\nIf Charles could have looked through the thick walls of his vault, he\r\nwould have seen that which might well have called down an immediate\r\nsentence of death on all his household; that which added new horrors to\r\nhis wife’s suspense, and increased the agony of poor Pierre, standing as\r\nhe was in the grasp of two of the enemy, and assured by the fish-women\r\nabout him that he was to be hanged as soon as they could find a cord. He\r\nforgot his own situation for a moment when he looked up to the balcony,\r\nand saw the deplorable mistake which was likely to prove the destruction\r\nof the whole family. Nobody within doors had thought of M. Raucourt,\r\nwhom no event was now ever known to bring from his easy chair at the\r\nfront window. He was left alone while the back of the house was being\r\nbarricaded with all speed, and messengers put out upon the roof to find\r\ntheir way, if possible, to the authorities; or at least to make signals\r\nfor assistance. But the children came in a state of amazement to\r\ngrandpapa, and the shouts reached even his dull ear, and recalled the\r\nassociations which in the old royalist were always the first to be\r\nawakened. He had no other idea than that the people were hailing the\r\nroyal family, and he resolved not to be behind others in his duty. He\r\nsent Pauline for the white cockade he had given her, tottered to his\r\nchamber, got out, under a new impulse of strength, upon the balcony, and\r\nwaved his white favour. It was this which had silenced the mob with\r\nastonishment; and in the depth of this silence, the feeble, cracked\r\nvoice of the old man was heard trying to shout “Vive le Roi!”\r\n\r\nThe horrible burst of passion which followed was not directed against\r\nhim. The helplessness of his attitude as he stood supporting himself\r\nwith both hands, and the gleam of foolish pleasure which came over his\r\ncountenance, showed his real state; and even the lowest of the mob did\r\nnot yet make war against dotards. It was because his act was supposed to\r\nbetoken the politics of the family that it excited such an outcry; and\r\nthere seemed some reason for Pierre’s fears that the very house would be\r\npresently levelled with the ground. It made his heart sick within him to\r\nsee the old man smiling and bowing, and trying to induce the shrinking\r\nchildren to come and stand beside him, and resisting his wretched\r\ndaughter’s attempts to withdraw him. Pierre struggled fiercely, but in\r\nvain; he implored, more humbly than he would have stooped to do for his\r\nown life, to be allowed two minutes’ speech to the people. He met only\r\nthreats and laughter. The threats mattered little to a man who expected\r\nto be hanged in a few minutes, but the laughter stung him to the soul.\r\nHe cursed himself for the folly of having appealed to those who could\r\nmock the innocence of dotage and childhood, and disregard the agony of a\r\nwoman: and he recalled the words in which he had at first spoken to them\r\nas the French people.\r\n\r\nPierre was right. These were no sample of the French people who had\r\nbegun to cast off the yoke of tyranny. These were a portion of the\r\nbrutalized class who, in using the word tyranny, thought only of the\r\ndifference between suffering and inflicting it: who, when they talked of\r\nliberty, asked for license to plunder palaces and riot in wine-cellars.\r\nThese were, in short, the Orleans mob, and not the real authors of the\r\npolitical changes now taking place. They aided these changes at the\r\ntime, indeed, by testifying to the degree of oppression which the lower\r\norders had till now suffered; and they furnish, to this day and for\r\never, an instructive commentary upon these changes, in as far as they\r\nexhibit the operation of despotism in preparing its own downfall by at\r\nonce brutalizing and exasperating its victims. But still these were\r\nperfectly distinct from the true protectors of liberty, the wise and\r\nsteady opponents of despotism. These last were very differently employed\r\nthis morning, and tidings of their doings came just in time to preserve\r\nCharles and his family.\r\n\r\nThe children had already been sent away by the roof, in charge of the\r\nservants, and Marguerite had sat down alone beside the chair of her\r\nfather, (whom it was impossible to remove, and whom she would not\r\nleave,) when sounds reached her which gave her back a little of the hope\r\nshe had wholly surrendered. It was not the approach of soldiers, nor the\r\npotential voices of magistrates, nor any of the welcome intimations of\r\nhelp at hand which conclude a riot and disperse a rabble in an orderly\r\ncountry, and under ordinary circumstances. Neither soldiers nor\r\nmagistrates could be depended upon, or had any power in Paris at this\r\ntime but that which the outrageous mob chose to allow them. Marguerite\r\nknew this so well, that, though she took all precautions in sending for\r\naid, she expected none but that which might arise from accident. Such a\r\ndiversion of the people’s rage as actually happened was beyond her\r\nhopes.\r\n\r\nWhile her father was still talking about the king, and she was holding\r\nhim down in his chair, in opposition to his complaints of not being\r\nallowed to go to the window to pay his duty, the fearful sound of the\r\ntocsin was heard above all the uproar in the court and street. One cry\r\nseemed to come on the four winds,—“To the Bastille! to the Bastille!” At\r\nfirst confused and reiterated, the clangor and the shout echoed noisily\r\nfrom street to street, from steeple to steeple. Presently the cry became\r\nmore concentrated, as if the city sent up but one mighty voice.\r\nMarguerite sank down on her knees, overcome with the hope of deliverance\r\nfor her husband; but the mob did not yet cease to batter the door which\r\nshielded him, and the fierce women cried out that they would not be\r\ndecoyed away by a false alarm. After a few more moments came the booming\r\nof cannon on the ear, and a pause followed in the court. Again it came,\r\nand again, and the windows rattled, and there was in the intervals quiet\r\nenough for the rushing of a steady stream of people to be heard from the\r\nstreets, from whom arose, in alternation with silence, the deep and\r\nsteady cry, “To the Bastille!” The mob in the court mixed with this\r\nstream, eager to learn what new scene was to be enacted, what better\r\nhope of plunder was presented than that afforded by the stores of an\r\nobstinate and insignificant wine-merchant, who had already caused them\r\nmore trouble than he and his goods were worth. They looked round for a\r\nsignal from their leader, but Orleans had disappeared some time before,\r\nnot choosing to be held responsible for the violence to which he had\r\ntempted his followers. They went to look for him at the Bastille, where\r\nhe was indeed present, to help, as usual, to disgrace a work set on foot\r\nby better men.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the court was empty, Marguerite flew to release her husband.\r\nCharles was listening intently to ascertain whether this hush was a\r\ntreacherous calm, or whether he was indeed safe for the present, when he\r\nfelt a breath of fresh air, and saw a glimmer of daylight fall into the\r\nmidst of the vault, and heard a faint voice calling to him,—\r\n\r\n“Come out, love! If you are safe, all is safe.”\r\n\r\nNot all, Charles remembered, when he had time to think of any one but\r\nhis wife. Before he even went to seek his children, and to recall the\r\nservants, he ascertained that Pierre had disappeared, and hurried out to\r\nlearn his fate, bending his steps to the Place de Grêve, where he feared\r\nhe was most likely to find his faithful servant, dead or alive. He found\r\ntwo bodies hanging, and cries of murderous exultation, which made his\r\nblood run cold, still echoing through the place; but Pierre was nowhere\r\nto be seen, and the bodies were those of soldiers. He saw more victims\r\nbrought to the foot of the lamp-posts; but they came from the direction\r\nof the Bastille, and were evidently members of the invalid garrison.\r\nThrough some unseen influence exerted in the crowd, these men were\r\nspared, which gave Charles the hope that Pierre, if yet living, would\r\nescape. In fact, he was safe enough, being at this moment employed in\r\ndrawing the people to the attack upon that gloomy fortress, which was\r\nregarded with more detestation by Frenchmen than if it had been a\r\npest-house. When Pierre had by his energy sufficiently attested his good\r\ncitizenship to be allowed to depart whither he would, he ran homewards,\r\nmet his master in search of him, embraced the children, kissed\r\nMarguerite’s hand, and hastened back again to assist the siege, as if\r\nnothing had happened to himself that morning. Charles did the same,\r\nhaving persuaded his wife that he should be safer before the Bastille\r\nthan at home, and left her in the protection of Steele, who had returned\r\nfrom his fruitless errand to the magistrates; fruitless, because they\r\ncould listen to no petitions for private succour while the grand work of\r\nthe demolition of the state-fortress was going on under their sanction,\r\nand the control of their forces.\r\n\r\nSteele had no more idea of remaining with the women and children on such\r\nan occasion, than his friend Charles. As soon as he had persuaded\r\nMarguerite to lie down, and had seen grandpapa and the children at play\r\ntogether again, and called in two stout porters of the establishment to\r\nkeep watch below, he also disappeared. Often and vehemently did he\r\nprotest in after years that he would not for any consideration have been\r\nabsent from that siege; and of all his possessions, none were so valued\r\nby him as a link of the chain from which one of the captives had been\r\nreleased by Steele’s own hands; which link the Englishman carried about\r\nhim to the day of his death.\r\n\r\nWhile Marguerite slept, through pure exhaustion, occasionally starting\r\nat the sound of cannon, or scared with visions of the horrible faces she\r\nhad seen in the court so lately, her husband was actively disproving, to\r\nas many as might observe him, his being a royalist. He lent a helping\r\nhand to one work after another; now assisting in letting down the\r\ndrawbridges successively; now in hauling forward the cannon; now in\r\ndemolishing the guard-houses; now in forcing an entrance into the gloomy\r\nplace itself; and finally, shouting for the release of the prisoners.\r\nEverything was forgotten but the work before his eyes: hours flew like\r\nminutes, amidst the intenseness of the occupation; and yet, if his\r\nthoughts reverted for a moment to the events of the morning, they seemed\r\nof ancient date,—as if he had lived a lifetime in this one day.\r\n\r\nThe spectacles of a lifetime were indeed to be beheld within the compass\r\nof this one scene. The most vivid emotions to which all ranks and all\r\nages are subject were here in full play: all the various grouping which\r\nlife affords was here presented; the entire elements of the scenery of\r\nhuman character were here congregated in infinite and magnificent\r\ncombinations. The appeals to eye and ear alone were of unprecedented\r\nforce; those addressed to the spirit equalled in stimulus the devotion\r\nof Leonidas in his defile, and excelled in pathos the meditation of\r\nMarius among more extensive ruins than those which were now tumbling\r\naround. From the heights of the fortress might be seen a heaving ocean\r\nof upturned faces, when the breeze dispersed at intervals the clouds of\r\nsmoke which veiled the sun, and gave a dun and murky hue to whatever lay\r\nbeneath. If a flood of sunshine now and then poured in to make a hundred\r\nthousand weapons glitter over the heads of the crowd, the black row of\r\ncannon belched forth their red fires to extinguish the purer light. The\r\nforemost of the people, with glaring eyes, and blackened and grinning\r\nfaces, looked scarcely human, in their excess of eagerness, activity,\r\nand strength. Yet more terrific were the sounds: the clang of the tocsin\r\nat regular intervals, the shouts of the besiegers, the shrieks of the\r\nwounded, the roar of the fire which was consuming the guard-houses, the\r\ncrash of the ruins falling on all sides, a heavy splash in the moat from\r\ntime to time, as some one was toppled from the ramparts to be smothered\r\nin its mud,—and above all these, the triumphant cries of victory and\r\nliberty achieved,—these were enough to dizzy weak brains, and give\r\ninspiration to strong ones. Here were also the terrors which sooner or\r\nlater chill the marrow of despotism, and the stern joy with which its\r\nretribution fires the heart of the patriot. Here were the servants of\r\ntyranny quailing before the glance of the people; kneeling soldiers\r\ncraving mercy of mechanics, of women, of some of every class whom, in\r\nthe execution of their fancied duty, they had outraged. Here were men\r\nshrinking from violence with a craven horror, and women driven by a\r\nsense of wrong to show how disgusting physical courage may be made. Here\r\nwere also sons led on to the attack by their hitherto anxious fathers;\r\nhusbands thrust forward into danger by their wives; and little children\r\nupreared by their mothers amidst the fire and smoke, to take one last\r\nlook of the hated edifice which was soon to be levelled with the ground.\r\nThe towers of palaces might be seen afar, where princes were quaking at\r\nthis final assurance of the downfall of their despotic sway, knowing\r\nthat the assumed sanctity of royalty was being wafted away with every\r\npuff of smoke which spread itself over the sky, and their\r\nirresponsibility melting in fires lighted by the hands which they had\r\nvainly attempted to fetter, and blown by the breath which they had\r\nimagined they could stifle. They had denied the birth of that liberty\r\nwhose baptism in fire and in blood was now being celebrated in a\r\nmany-voiced chaunt with which the earth should ring for centuries. Some\r\nfrom other lands were already present to hear and join in it; some free\r\nBritons to aid, some wondering slaves of other despots to slink\r\nhomewards with whispered tidings of its import; for from that day to\r\nthis, the history of the fall of the Bastille has been told as a secret\r\nin the vineyards of Portugal, and among the groves of Spain, and in the\r\npatriotic conclaves of the youth of Italy, while it has been loudly and\r\njoyfully proclaimed from one end to the other of Great Britain, till her\r\nlisping children are familiar with the tale.\r\n\r\nThe congregation would not have been complete without the presence of\r\nanother class of witnesses whose very existence will perhaps be matter\r\nof incredulity in some future age of the world;—that class which man has\r\ntaken upon himself to institute, and which will one day rise up against\r\nhim in judgment of his abused power. There were captives present in this\r\nscene of lawless freedom,—or rather of freedom above the law. They were\r\nthere, first trembling before the assailants, and then marvelling at the\r\ntreatment they received, as the kid would marvel at being dandled by the\r\nlion. So it appeared to be with most of them, while one or two caught\r\nthe tone of popular triumph before the doors of their cells were opened,\r\nand others received their deliverance in a manner that rent the heart of\r\nthe deliverers.\r\n\r\nWhen the capture of the place was complete, and its defenders had been\r\ncarried off, some to be sacrificed for the sins of the government, and\r\nothers to meet with mercy, Charles pressed forward, with a multitude of\r\ncompanions, to release the captives. It was hard labour to pull the\r\nclenched doors from their staples and hinges; and in some cases it was\r\nfound easier to effect the work in a yet more irregular manner: as in\r\none to which Steele called Charles’s attention when they accidentally\r\nmet in the centre of the fortress, where the light of day, however,\r\nstreamed upon them through the demolished roof. Steele’s face was\r\nworking in strong emotion, and he appeared speechless while he seized\r\nhis friend by the arm, and drew him to gaze on what made his heart’s\r\nblood boil. Steele pointed through a breach in the enormous wall, whose\r\nthickness shut out all sound from the inmate of the dungeon it inclosed;\r\nand there, with eyes drooped before the unwonted light,—a light which,\r\nhowever, only half displayed the squalid sickliness of his countenance,\r\nsat one who seemed to take no heed of any human presence. His expanded\r\nnostrils and half-opened mouth seemed to betoken that there had been\r\npassion and expectation within him; but the apathy and despondency of\r\nhis attitude exhibited a strange contradiction to these evidences. When\r\nthe first face appeared through the opening, he fumbled uneasily with\r\nhis hands in his coarse dungeon dress; and when he was hailed, more and\r\nmore loudly, under the idea that he was deaf, his beard was seen to stir\r\nupon his breast, and his lips to move, as if he was attempting in vain\r\nto articulate a sound. The endeavour presently ceased, though voice\r\nafter voice was heard in importunity,—sometimes endearing, sometimes\r\nrallying,—that he would rise and help to free himself. It was a work of\r\ntime to make a breach large enough to admit his deliverers; and at last,\r\njust before the first of them clambered in, the captive uplifted his\r\nbroken and unmodulated voice in a few words, one or two of which Steele\r\nrecognized to be English.\r\n\r\n“O! he is a Briton!” cried he, clenching his hands above his head in the\r\nextremity of passion; and, staggering against the wall, he uttered a\r\ndeep curse on the tyranny by which a countryman had been goaded into\r\nmadness far from his own land, and from all who could know or avenge his\r\nstate. Again and again he looked; again and again he withdrew, unable to\r\nbear the alternating aspects of idiotcy and gibbering madness. At last,\r\nhe made trial of a new kind of stimulus; leaning through the breach, and\r\ncalling to the captive,—\r\n\r\n“O come, and take the hand of a brother once more! Look up, and tell us\r\nthat your deliverers are welcome! Let it be crime, or let it be misery\r\nthat has stricken you so deeply, the last day of your dungeon life is\r\nover. Come, and hear about England! Come and feel the fresh air——”\r\n\r\nThe prisoner here shivered, as if already chilled by the air of a warm\r\nJuly day. Encouraged by this sign of attention, Steele went on.\r\n\r\n“Only tell us whom you fear, and we will carry you far from them. Only\r\nname those you love, and I will get you tidings of them. Come and help\r\nus to free yourself and others; for you know more of the secrets of this\r\nhorrible place than we.”\r\n\r\nHe would not move, however; and when they got to him, they found that he\r\nwas chained by the middle to the wall behind him. It was impossible to\r\nlearn from him his name, alleged offence, or period of imprisonment.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the Count de Solages was also liberated that it was\r\nascertained that his name was White; that he had been confined for some\r\nunknown offence for many years in the castle of Vincennes, whence he was\r\nremoved, in company with the count, to the Bastille, seven years before.\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                     THE PHILOSOPHY OF BARGAINING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people carried away all the prisoners on their shoulders, intending\r\nto make them tell their stories in the coffee-houses of Paris; but\r\nSteele could not bear to see his countryman,—such a mere wreck of\r\nhumanity as he was,—thus exhibited. He thankfully accepted his friend\r\nCharles’s invitation to bring him first to his house, and try whether\r\nthe intellects of the sufferer could be restored by any method of\r\ntreatment—treatment which was more likely to be efficacious if\r\nadministered by one who could speak his own language than by strangers.\r\nFired as Steele had been in the achievement of the great work of the\r\nday, he now left the completion of it to others. While the mayor and\r\nexecutive were sending forth their popular decrees,—while the king was\r\ninformed for the first time that his realm was in a state of\r\nrevolution,—while the helpless ministry looked in one another’s dismayed\r\nfaces,—while the city architects were employed under a regular\r\ncommission to make a perfect blank where the Bastille had stood, Steele\r\nwas watching over his released countryman, fondly hoping that he traced\r\nan hourly growing resemblance to manhood, not only in external\r\nappearance, but in thought and action. He tried to make him vary his\r\nposture, and to walk;—an exercise to which he was as much averse as one\r\nwho has taken laudanum. The next thing was to induce him to speak, which\r\nproved less difficult, provided he was permitted to mix up French and\r\nEnglish after his own fashion. There was sometimes more and sometimes\r\nless sense in what he said, and it was occasionally interrupted by fits\r\nof impotent passion, for which no immediate cause could be assigned.\r\nThese, however, came on only after his new way of life had continued for\r\nsome time, and were indeed stages in the growth of the unmanageable\r\nmadness which sent him, after all remedial means had been tried, to end\r\nhis days in the lunatic asylum at Charenton.\r\n\r\nBefore these had become terrifying to Charles’s children, they did not\r\nshrink from talking to him, and were encouraged to do so, as he spoke\r\nmore, and more sensibly to them than to any one else.\r\n\r\n“Why are you so very fond of water, I wonder?” exclaimed Julien, one\r\nday, laughing, when White held out his hand to snatch some which looked\r\ncool and clear in the boy’s hand. “O yes, you may have it. I can get\r\nplenty more. Why do you want so much water?”\r\n\r\n“I drink water. And my rat—Where is my rat?”\r\n\r\nNone of the family could make out why he looked about him for a rat: but\r\nSteele’s conjecture was that such an animal might have found its way out\r\nof the moat of the prison into the cell where no other living thing\r\ncould enter but the silent turnkey. On inquiry, this was found to be the\r\ncase; and the circumstances were touching in the extreme to those who\r\nhad never known what it was to want such a resource. It was observed\r\nthat White was as greedy of bread as of water, though not always for the\r\npurpose of eating it. Nothing could tempt him from it when there was any\r\nin the room; and whatever was offered in exchange for a crust, however\r\ndelicate to the taste, or glittering to the eye, was rejected. “Bread,\r\nbread. Water, water,” was for ever his cry.\r\n\r\n“He likes to play on my bird-organ,” observed Julien, “and I told him he\r\nmight keep it: but he thrust it back upon me for a piece of bread. He\r\nsold it much cheaper, papa,—for far less bread,—than the people that\r\nmade it. I think that is very silly.”\r\n\r\n“It depends upon the value he puts upon what he has in exchange,”\r\nanswered papa.\r\n\r\n“Well, you told me how much bread was worth this organ; and it was much\r\nmore than I gave him.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but you might happen to be shut up, as he has been, where one loaf\r\nof bread would be more useful to you than ten such at home.”\r\n\r\n“Why more useful? I can but eat bread anywhere.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; you can give it away,” interposed mamma. “If you were shut up for\r\nseveral years in a silent and nearly dark place, where nobody ever came\r\nto you, and were to hear a noise one day, and to see something moving,\r\nand to find out that it was a rat which had made its way to your cell;\r\nand if you wished that the rat should come again, and learn to know you,\r\nand feed tamely out of your hand, would you not desire to have some food\r\nto give it?”\r\n\r\n“O yes: I would give it part of my dinner.”\r\n\r\n“But if you had very little dinner, scarcely enough to satisfy your own\r\nhunger, you would buy more bread for your rat if you could. If your\r\njailer asked you much more than the bread would be worth out of prison,\r\nyou would give it him rather than your rat should not come and play with\r\nyou. You would pay him first all your copper, and then all your silver,\r\nand then all your gold.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, because I could not play with money so pleasantly as with a live\r\nanimal, and there would be nothing else that I could buy in such a\r\nplace. I had rather have the company of my rat than a pocket full of\r\ngold.”\r\n\r\n“So White thought,” observed Marguerite, “and he gave the turnkey every\r\nthing he had left for bread, till his buttons, and his pencil case, and\r\neven his watch were all gone. It was a long time before he could bring\r\nhimself to part with his watch; for the moving of the wheels was\r\nsomething to look at, and the ticking kept his ears awake, and made him\r\nfeel less desolate: but when it came to giving up his watch or his rat,\r\nhe thought he could least spare his live companion: so he carefully\r\nobserved for some time the shifting of the glimmering light upon the\r\nwall, as the morning passed into noon, and noon into afternoon and\r\nevening, and then he thought this sort of dial might serve him instead\r\nof a watch, and he gave it to the turnkey on condition of having an\r\nounce more bread every day for a year.”\r\n\r\n“He must have been pleased to have made his bargain for a whole year.”\r\n\r\n“His pleasure lasted a very short while. The turnkey came earlier than\r\nusual one day when the rat was there, and twisted its neck before White\r\ncould stop him.”\r\n\r\nJulien stamped with grief and anger when he heard this; but presently\r\nsupposed the turnkey was honest enough to restore the watch. Charles\r\nshook his head in answer, and told his little son that poor White had\r\nbeen quite crazy since that day, and had talked about nothing but a rat,\r\nand shown no desire for any thing but bread and water since, though it\r\nwas six years ago that his misfortune had happened.\r\n\r\n“Did you ever hear of paying for water, Julien; or for air?”\r\n\r\nNo: Julien thought that God had given both so freely that it would be a\r\nsin to sell them. His father thought this not a good reason; for it\r\nseemed to him fair that men should buy and sell whenever one wanted\r\nsomething that another person had too much of; as much air and water as\r\ncorn and flax, which were also given by God.\r\n\r\n“Ah, but, papa, it costs men a great deal of trouble to prepare corn and\r\nflax.”\r\n\r\n“True; and now you have hit upon the right reason. If corn and flax grew\r\nof themselves on land which belonged to nobody, would you pay for them,\r\nor just gather them without paying?”\r\n\r\n“I should be very silly to pay when I might have them without.”\r\n\r\n“So I think: but would corn and flax be less valuable then than now,\r\nwhen we have to pay very dear for them?”\r\n\r\n“The corn would be just as good to eat, and the flax to make linen of:\r\nbut they would not to change away.”\r\n\r\n“No more than the air, which is very useful in breathing, or water which\r\nwe could not do without, and which yet would be a very poor thing to\r\ncarry to market. Now, would you call water a valuable thing or not,\r\nJulien?”\r\n\r\n“No, not at all, because it will buy nothing——O yes, but it is though;\r\nbecause we could not do without it.—Mamma, is water valuable or not?”\r\n\r\n“Very valuable in use, but not usually in exchange. When things are\r\nvaluable in exchange, it is either because they cost labour before they\r\ncould be used, or because they are very scarce.”\r\n\r\n“So,” observed Charles, “if a mine should ever be dug so deep that the\r\nair is not fresh at the bottom where the miners work, the owner of the\r\nmine would be very glad to buy air of any one who could convey it down\r\nby a machine. Such an one would be wise to charge so much a gallon for\r\nthe fresh air he supplied, to pay for the labour and expense of his\r\nmachine, and for the trouble of working it.”\r\n\r\nMarguerite then mentioned that she once staid in a small country town\r\nduring a drought. There was no reservoir of water, and all the pumps and\r\ncisterns were dry. The poor people went out by night into the\r\nneighbouring country, and watched the springs; and any one who was\r\nfortunate enough to obtain a gallon of fresh water was well paid for it.\r\nThe price rose every day, till at last one woman gave a calf for a\r\npailfull of water, hoping to save her cow, it being certain that both\r\nmust die without this supply.\r\n\r\n“And did she save her cow?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. While the woman was anxiously sitting up in bed, planning what she\r\nshould change away next, she fancied there was a different feel in the\r\nair; and on looking out of the window, she found the sky covered with\r\nblack clouds; and before morning, the trade in water was over. There was\r\nnobody to give a doit for a cistern-full.”\r\n\r\n“It was just so with me,” observed Charles, “when I was besieged in the\r\ncellar. I was parched with thirst, and would have given a pipe of my\r\nbest wine to any one who would have let me down a quart of water through\r\nthe trap-door. Three hours after, I myself threw hundreds of gallons on\r\nthe fire at the guard houses, when the order was given to take them down\r\nin an orderly way; and I did not consider such use of the water any\r\nwaste. So much for the value which is given by scarcity.”\r\n\r\n“But, papa, though things are more valuable to people when there is a\r\nscarcity of them, the people are less rich than they were before. That\r\nseems to me very odd.”\r\n\r\n“Because you have been accustomed to consider value and wealth as the\r\nsame things, which they are not. Our wealth consists in whatever is\r\nvaluable in use as well as in exchange. Owing to the storm of last year,\r\nI have less wealth in my possession now than I had then, though what I\r\nhave may, perhaps, exchange for more wealth still. I have as much\r\nfurniture, and as many clothes and luxuries, and as much money; but I\r\nhave fewer growing vines, and much less wine. If I were to use up my own\r\ngrapes and wine instead of selling them, they would last a much shorter\r\ntime than my stock of the former year would have lasted. So I have less\r\nwealth in possession. But the value of wine has risen so high, in\r\nconsequence of scarcity, that I can get as much now of other things in\r\nexchange for a pint, as I could, fourteen months ago, in exchange for a\r\ngallon.”\r\n\r\n“But that is partly because the wine is older. Mr. Steele is very\r\nparticular about the wine being old, and he pays you much more, he told\r\nme, the longer it has been kept.”\r\n\r\n“And it is very fair he should, for reasons which you can hardly\r\nunderstand yet.”\r\n\r\n“Try him,” said Marguerite.\r\n\r\n“It is impossible, my dear. I refer to the charges I am at for the rent\r\nof my cellar, the wear of my casks, and the loss of interest upon the\r\ncapital locked up in the wine. All this must be paid out of the\r\nimprovement in the quality of the article; and all this, Julien must\r\nwait a few years to understand.\r\n\r\n“Now tell me, my boy, whether you think it a good thing or not that\r\nthere should be a scarcity of wine?”\r\n\r\n“Why, papa, as we do not want to drink all you have ourselves, and as\r\npeople will give you as much for it as they would for twice as much, I\r\ndo not think it signifies to you; but it must be a bad thing for the\r\npeople of Paris that there is so little wine to be had. At least you\r\nsaid so about the bread.”\r\n\r\n“But if my wine should be as dear next year, and I should have no more\r\nlosses from storms, and no more expense than in common years, in growing\r\nmy wine, would the high price be a good thing for me or not?”\r\n\r\n“It would be good for you, and bad for your customers; only I think they\r\nwould not give you so much for your wine. They would remember that there\r\nhad been no more storms, and they would find people that had cheaper\r\nwine to sell, and then they would leave off buying of you.”\r\n\r\n“And they would be very right, if there was anybody to sell cheaper; as\r\nthere would be, if labourers had less wages, and so made it less\r\nexpensive to grow and prepare wine. But if some way was found of making\r\nmore wine than ever, in a cheaper way than ever, who would be the better\r\nfor that?”\r\n\r\n“The people that buy of you, because I suppose you would let them have\r\nit cheaper.”\r\n\r\n“And papa too,” said Marguerite, “for many people would buy wine who\r\ncannot afford it now.”\r\n\r\n“Therefore,” concluded Charles, “a high exchangeable value is not at all\r\na good thing for everybody, though it may be for a time to some few. And\r\na low exchangeable value is a very good thing to everybody, if it arises\r\nfrom the only cause which can render it permanent,—a diminution of the\r\ncost of production.”\r\n\r\n“But if this happened with every article,” pursued Marguerite, “there\r\nwould be an end of the cheapness, though not of the plenty. As many of\r\none thing would exchange for a certain number of other things as\r\nbefore.”\r\n\r\n“True; but less labour would purchase them all; and this is the grand\r\nconsideration. As less labour will now purchase a deal table than was\r\nonce necessary to procure a rough hewn log in its place, less labour\r\nstill may hereafter buy a mahogany one; and this is a desirable thing\r\nfor the purchasers of tables, and no less for the makers, who will then\r\nsell a hundred times the number they can dispose of now.”\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                              NEW DEVICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Parisians soon after showed that they knew little of the resources\r\non which the supply of the wants of the state should depend, by having\r\nrecourse to a measure which, however popular, was one of great\r\nfolly;—folly to be exceeded only by an act of the populace which took\r\nplace nearly at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe coffers of the government had long been empty. Loans of almost every\r\nkind, and under every species of pretence, had been raised upon the\r\nsuffering nation, some of which proved failures in their primary object,\r\nwhile others, however great the proceeds in amount, seemed to be\r\nexhausted with somewhat the same speed as water that is poured into a\r\nsieve. Never money went away so fast before; and whilst the government\r\nwas dismayed at its magic property of disappearance, the people grew\r\nmore and more angry at what they thought the extravagance of their\r\nrulers. Neither of them took into the account the scarcity of most of\r\nthe necessaries of life, and both regarded money as having the same\r\nvalue as ever,—as being, in itself, the thing required to supply the\r\nnecessities of the state. To both it was equally inconceivable why, if\r\nso much had defrayed such and such expenses in former years, double the\r\nsum would go no way at all at present. The ministers and the court could\r\nonly tremble at the necessity of owning the truth, while the people\r\nraged, and could be appeased only by court largesses for the relief of\r\nthe starving: which largesses went as little way when they had changed\r\nhands as before. Neither party suspected that money, although scarce,\r\nhad become very cheap through the still greater scarcity of other\r\nthings; and in the absence of this necessary knowledge, everybody was\r\neager about gold and silver.\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly had tried all means, first by themselves, and then\r\nwith the assistance of Necker, to raise a supply, without which the\r\naffairs of the state could not, they believed, proceed; and all in vain.\r\nThen Necker had leave given him to pursue his own methods; and, popular\r\nas he was, no one had a doubt that he would succeed. But he failed,\r\nthough he issued the most tempting proposals; offered the highest\r\ninterest that ever was heard of, even in such an emergency; and exerted\r\nhis utmost personal influence in favour of the loan. The subscription\r\nwas not half filled: the reason of which was that many had no money,\r\nhaving spent it all in buying necessaries; and as many in France as had\r\ntaken their money (much of it had gone into other countries) expected to\r\nwant it themselves for the same purposes, or had not confidence enough\r\nin the stability of the government to take it for a creditor. So the\r\nking’s horses went on to eat borrowed hay or to want it; and the king’s\r\nservants to clamour for their wages; and the king’s tradesmen to decline\r\norders on one pretence or another; and the police threatened to leave\r\nthe home minister to keep order by himself; and state couriers went\r\nunwillingly forth on their journies; and business lagged in every\r\ndepartment of the administration.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, it entered some wise head that, if people would not lend\r\nmoney, they might lend or give something else; not corn or hay, or any\r\nof the necessaries of life; for every one knew there was still less of\r\nthese things than of money; but gold and silver in any form. It would\r\nhave been hard to say what lasting good this could do amidst the\r\nimpossibility of procuring the necessaries of which gold and silver are\r\nonly the representatives: but no matter for that. Nobody was asked to\r\nexplain the affair, and apparently none troubled themselves to think\r\nabout it; so delighted were all with the new notion of giving away\r\ntrinkets to save the state. The idea of a patriotic contribution was\r\ncharming,—a contribution in which almost everybody could join; women and\r\nchildren, and persons of many degrees below the class of capitalists.\r\nThe court joined: the gentlemen sacrificing nearly half their watches\r\nand seals, and the ladies adopting simplicity as a fashion, and sending\r\naway the jewellery they could not wear as Arcadian shepherdesses and\r\nSicilian nymphs. The Assembly followed, every member thereof stooping\r\ndown at the same moment to strip his shoes of their buckles, so that\r\ntheir act of patriotic devotion made really a very fine show. This gave\r\nthe signal to the whole country, and all France was forthwith unbuckled\r\nin respect of the feet. She became also quakerlike as to the hands, for\r\nnot a maiden but took out her lover’s hair from his parting gift, and\r\nflung the ring into the lap of the nation; not a wife that did not part\r\nwith the token of her wifehood in the cause. Pecks of gold rings,\r\nbushels of silver buckles, with huge store of other baubles, were at\r\nonce in the possession of the state; and the people no longer doubted\r\nthat all would henceforth be well.\r\n\r\nAnd what was really the event?—The gold answered the same purpose as it\r\ndoes when a basin full of it coined stands on the banker’s counter\r\nduring a run. It satisfied the ignorant that all must be safe where\r\nthere is so much wealth actually before one’s eyes. It hushed the\r\nclamours of the people for a little while; and made the servants of the\r\ngovernment willing to go on somewhat longer upon credit; so that more\r\nindustry and briskness prevailed for a time, at the risk of ultimate\r\ndisappointment, and an aggravation of popular fury,—now diverted but not\r\ndispersed. A mob went about to _levy_ these _voluntary_ offerings, an\r\nact ludicrously inconsistent with their next proceeding; if, indeed, any\r\nof the events of this extraordinary time could be regarded as ludicrous.\r\n\r\nThey called at Charles’s house among others, whence, as it happened, no\r\nsuch offerings had yet gone forth. Charles had resisted Pauline’s wish\r\nto lend the queen her thimble, and Julien’s offer to pay his first tax\r\nwith the silver-tipped riding-whip grandpapa had given him. Neither\r\nwould he allow Marguerite’s few ornaments, all keepsakes, to be thrown\r\naway in any such manner. He would give the coat off his back to the\r\nstate, he said, when it could do any service; but the proposed gifts\r\ncould only help to make jewellery a drug, without supplying one more\r\nperson with bread, or lessening by so much as one scruple the burdens of\r\nthe state. He was disposed to be vexed when he came home one day, and\r\nfound a short allowance of spoons at the dinner-table, the clock on the\r\nmantel-piece gone, and his wife as destitute of external ornament as any\r\nArcadian shepherdess at Versailles. He laughed, however, at his wife’s\r\napologies for having made a voluntary offering against her own will as\r\nwell as his, and hoped that she would be as little the worse as the\r\nstate would be the better for the sacrifice. Goldsmiths and jewellers of\r\nenterprise and capital would profit by the fancy, he observed, if nobody\r\nelse did; and the many losers might find some comfort in sympathy with\r\nthe very few winners.\r\n\r\nThe people, meanwhile, were bitterly complaining of famine, and the more\r\ngold was carried to the treasury, the more bread was bought up before\r\nthe eyes of those who were deprived of it from its increased price. It\r\nmattered not that some was given away in charity by the king, and more,\r\nto suit his own purposes, by the duke of Orleans; the people were\r\nrendered unable to purchase it, and furnished with the plea of want,\r\nwherewith to make the streets of Paris echo. It would have been better\r\nto have let the exchange of wedding rings for bread be made without the\r\ninterposition of the king or his ministers, even without taking into\r\nconsideration the events which followed. A report was soon industriously\r\nspread that the bread furnished by court charity was of a bad quality.\r\nIt was believed, like everything that was then said against the court;\r\nand the consequence was that an anomalous and melancholy sight was seen\r\nby as many as walked in the city. Clamorous, starving crowds besieged\r\nthe bakers’ shops, and carried off all the bread from their ovens, all\r\nthe flour from their bins; while the discontented among the mob\r\npoliticians of the Orleans faction were on the way to snatch the food\r\nfrom the mouths of the hungry and throw it into the river, and to cut\r\nthe sacks, and mix the flour with the puddles of the streets. Want and\r\nwaste, faction and delusion were here seen in their direct extremes.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Charles and Marguerite did not allow their children to go\r\nout under any guardianship but that of their father, as it was\r\nimpossible to foresee what might happen in the streets before they could\r\nget home again. They were as safe as any could be at such a time;—safer\r\nthan the few who ventured abroad in carriages at the risk of insult\r\nwherever they turned; safer than the sordidly fed and clad, who were\r\nseized upon by the agents of faction to augment their mobs, and be made\r\nthe instruments of violence under the penalty of suffering it\r\nthemselves. The parents and children were also safer together than\r\nseparate; as a domestic party, abroad to take the air, presented as\r\nunsuspicious a group, and one as likely to pass unnoticed, as could well\r\nbe imagined. Yet they had their occasional alarms; and when there was no\r\ncause to fear for themselves, were too often grieved and shocked at what\r\nthey beheld inflicted on others.\r\n\r\n“O papa!” cried Julien, one day, as they were walking; “what are they\r\ndoing at Maigrot’s shop? I do believe the crowd is coming there next.”\r\n\r\nMaigrot was a baker, well known to Charles’s family, and much beloved by\r\nthe children, on account of the little hot cakes which seemed to be\r\nalways ready to pop out of the oven and into their mouths, when they\r\nwent with the servant to deliver orders or pay bills.\r\n\r\nInstead of his usual smiling face, Maigrot was now seen in a state of\r\ndesperate anxiety, as well as could be judged from the glimpse of him at\r\nhis door, trying first to slip out, and then to force his way between\r\nthe two men who were evidently placed at the entrance as guards till the\r\nmob should come up. Foiled in his attempt, Maigrot disappeared, and\r\nCharles thought that it might depend on whether there was a way of exit\r\nat the back of the house, whether his head would presently be carried on\r\na pike, between two loaves of his own bread, or whether he would be\r\nkneading and baking in peace ten years hence. There seemed to be just\r\ntime to run and give a word of advice to whomsoever might be waiting in\r\nthe shop, and Charles ran forward to do so. He was prevented entering;\r\nbut seeing Maigrot’s wife sinking and trembling behind the counter, and\r\nlooking absolutely incapable of any resolution whatever, he called out\r\nto her to assist in emptying the flour bins and distributing the bread,\r\nand to fear nothing, and all would be well. The woman tossed off a glass\r\nof water which stood beside her, and rallied for the effort. In such\r\neffort lay the only resource of sufferers under violence in those days;\r\nfor the magistracy were unable to afford assistance; or, if able, were\r\nnot to be depended on. The shop was presently emptied and gutted, and\r\nits stock carried away, without, however, being in this instance\r\npreceded by the horrible display of a human head. Maigrot had escaped\r\nand actually joined in with the mob in time to see his own flour cast\r\ninto the Seine. Nobody thought more of the baker, and he took advantage\r\nof this disregard to learn a great deal of his own doings which he did\r\nnot know before. He now overheard that his flour was mixed with hurtful\r\ningredients by order of his customer, the king; that an inferior kind\r\nwas sold at high prices as the best; and that there were stores of meal\r\nconcealed somewhere about his premises, to victual the soldiers who were\r\nto be brought to rule the city, and give the king his own way. All this\r\nwas news to Maigrot, who was compelled to listen to these falsehoods in\r\nsilence: more fortunate than many who had lost their lives as well as\r\ntheir good name under similar charges. A defender sprang up, however,\r\nwhen he least expected it.\r\n\r\nCharles and his little son could not help following to look on, when the\r\nmob proceeded with the flour down to the river. They stood on the\r\noutskirts of the crowd, watching sack after sack as, with hoarse shouts,\r\nit was heaved into the water so as to make the heaviest splash possible.\r\nA new amusement presently occurred to some of the leaders; that of\r\ntesting the political opinions of the passers by by the judgment they\r\nshould pronounce on the quality of the flour. Those who declared it good\r\nmust, of course, be parasites of the court; those who made mouths at it\r\nwere the friends of the people; and the moment this point was settled,\r\nevery gazer from a distance was hauled to the water’s edge to undergo\r\nthe test; every approaching carriage was waylaid and stopped, and its\r\ninmates brought on the shoulders of the mob. Of course, all gave\r\njudgment on the same side;—a thing likely to happen without much\r\ndishonesty, when the raw flour was crammed into the mouth by foul and\r\nsometimes bloody hands. It would have been difficult to pronounce it\r\nvery good under such circumstances of administration.\r\n\r\nAmong the most piteous looking of those under test was the marquis de\r\nThou, who was taken from a non-descript sort of carriage, on his way, as\r\nhe vowed, to the duke of Orleans, but certainly attended by more than\r\none servant of the royal household. While prosecuting his explanations\r\nwith gesture and grimace, uplifted as he was above the crowd, he looked\r\nso like a monkey riding a bear that a universal shout of mockery arose.\r\nHe was lowered for a moment, out of sight; and the laugh rose louder\r\nthan ever when he reappeared, held at arms’ length by a hundred hands,\r\npowdered all over like a miller. His position made the judgment he had\r\nto give all the more difficult, for it enabled him to perceive the royal\r\nservants watching him on one side, the duke of Orleans and some of his\r\nfiercest followers on another, and the pitiless mob around.\r\n\r\n“Ah! it is very, very good food for the poor, without doubt,” he\r\ndeclared, while in full view of the court party, and with his mouth\r\nstuffed with a compound which had just been taken from a puddle\r\nunderfoot. “Very fine nourishment for a good king to buy dear, and give\r\naway to a hungry people.—Ah! no more,—no more, I pray you! I shall\r\npresently dine, and it is enough. I cannot praise it more than I have\r\ndone.—Ah! but” (seeing the duke frowning) “I do not say but it may be a\r\nlittle sour,—and somewhat bitter,—yes, O yes, and gritty,—and, O do not\r\nmurder me, and I will also say hurtful.—And poisonous? Yes, no doubt it\r\nis poisonous,—clearly poisonous.—But, how bountiful of the king to think\r\nof how the poor should be fed!”\r\n\r\nThe marquis might think himself fortunate in getting off with a ducking\r\nin the yeasty flood, into which he was let down astride on a flour sack.\r\nWhile sneaking away through the crowd, after shaking his dripping queue,\r\nand drawing a long breath, he encountered Charles, whom he immediately\r\nrecognised, and with inconsiderate selfishness, exposed to the notice of\r\nthe crowd by his appeal.\r\n\r\n“Ah, my friend, here is a condition I am in! For our old friendship’s\r\nsake,—for the sake of our vicinity in Guienne, aid me!”\r\n\r\n“Do not answer him. Take no notice,” whispered Maigrot from behind;\r\n“’tis as much as your life is worth.”\r\n\r\nBut Charles could not be inhuman. He gave the old man his arm to conduct\r\nhim to the carriage which he intended to order to his own house. Before\r\nhe had well turned his back, however, a piercing shriek from Julien made\r\nhim look round. The mob were about to carry the boy towards the sacks.\r\n\r\n“Do not be alarmed, my dear,” said he. “Taste the flour, and say whether\r\nyou think it good; and I will come to you in a moment to do the same.”\r\n\r\nJulien shrieked no more, but he looked ruefully in his father’s face,\r\nwhen Charles returned. As soon as he had gulped down his share and could\r\nspeak, he said he had never tasted raw flour before, but it was not so\r\ngood as the hot cakes that were made of it sometimes.—The boy escaped\r\nwith being only laughed at.—His father’s turn came next.\r\n\r\nCharles stipulated, when laid hold of, to be allowed to feed himself,\r\nand refused laughingly to taste what came out of the puddle till his\r\nneighbours should have separated the mud from the flour. With a very\r\noracular look, he then proceeded from sack to sack, tasting and\r\npronouncing, apparently unmoved by the speculations he heard going on\r\nall round him as to whether he was a royalist from about the court, or a\r\nspy from Versailles, or only an ignorant stranger from the provinces.\r\nWhen he had apparently made up his mind, he began a sort of conversation\r\nwith those nearest to him, which he exalted by degrees into a speech.\r\n\r\n“When I,” he observed, “I, the very first, opened a prisoner’s cell in\r\nthe Bastille——”\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by loud cheers from all who heard; and this drew the\r\nattention of more.\r\n\r\n“——I found,” continued Charles, “a mess of wholesome food in that\r\nhorrible place. Every other kind of poison was there,—the poison of\r\ndamps and a close atmosphere; the poison of inactivity which brings on\r\ndisease and death; the poison of cruelty by which all the kindly\r\nfeelings are turned into bitterness in the soul of the oppressed; and\r\nthe poison of hopelessness, by which the currents of life are chilled,\r\nand the heart of the captive is sunk within him till he dies. All these\r\npoisons we found in every cell; but to all their inmates was denied that\r\nquicker poison which would have been welcome to end their woes. Some, we\r\nknow, have lived thirty-five years under this slow death, while a very\r\nsmall mixture of drugs with their bread would have released them in\r\nfewer hours. That this quicker method was ever used, we have no proof;\r\nthat it was not used in the case of those whom we released, we know, not\r\nby their state of health alone; for that, alas! was not to be boasted\r\nof;—but by the experience of some of us. When we were heated with toil\r\nand choked with dust, we drank the draughts which the prisoners left\r\nuntasted in their cells. When a way was made among the ruins, women came\r\nto see what a work their husbands had achieved; and when their children\r\ncraved food, rather than return home before all was finished, they gave\r\ntheir little ones the bread which the captives had loathed. Many thus\r\nate and drank; and I appeal to you whether any evil came of that day;\r\nwhether the sleep of the next night was not sound as became the rest\r\nwhich succeeds to an heroic effort. No one was poisoned with the food\r\nthen provided by the government; and yet that horrible dungeon was the\r\nplace, if there be any, for poison to do its work. And if not attempted\r\nthere, will it be here? Here, where there are a million of eyes on the\r\nwatch to detect treasons against the people? Here, where there are\r\nhundreds of thousands of defenders of the public safety? No, fellow\r\ncitizens: this is not the kind of treason which is meditated against us.\r\nThere are none that dare practise so directly on your lives. But there\r\nis a treason no less fatal, though more disguised, which is even at this\r\nmoment in operation against you. You ask me two questions;—whether this\r\nfood is of a bad quality; and whether you are not half-starved; and both\r\nthese evils you ascribe to your rulers.—To the first I answer, that this\r\nfood is, to the best of my judgment, good; and, whether good or bad,\r\nthat the government has nothing to do with it, since it forms no part of\r\nthe stores that the king has bought up for distribution. It is flour of\r\nthe same harvest, the same field, the same mill, the same bin, that I\r\nand mine have been supplied from; and it has nourished me well for the\r\nwork I have had to do; for letting in the light of day upon the foulest\r\ndungeon that ever deformed the earth,—for watching over those who have\r\nbeen released from it,—for attending to the proceedings of the\r\nAssembly,—for meditating by night and consulting by day how the rights\r\nof the people may best be attained and secured. Keep the same food to\r\nstrengthen you for the same purposes. Do not forget your other\r\ncomplaint;—that you are starving: and remember that however much this\r\nmay be owing to the misrule and courtly extravagance you denounce, the\r\ngrievance will not be removed by your feeding the fishes with that which\r\nyour children are craving. I spoke of another kind of treason than that\r\nwhich you suspect, and I see about me too many tokens of its\r\nexistence;—the treason which would not poison but starve you.\r\n\r\n“Of the motives of this treason I have nothing to say, for I am wholly\r\nignorant of them. I only insist that there can be no truly patriotic aim\r\nunder the project of depriving you of the food which is at best but\r\nscantily supplied. Do you find in the most plentiful seasons that we\r\nhave corn enough to make sport with in the river? Are your houses even\r\nthen so filled with grain that, after feeding your children and domestic\r\nanimals, you have enough left for the eels of the Seine? Is it to give\r\nyou this over-supply that the peasantry of the provinces live under\r\nroofs of rushes, and couch upon beds of straw? Tell me,—is there in the\r\nhappiest of times such a superfluity that no Frenchman has a want or\r\nwish for more?”\r\n\r\nFurious cries of denial rose from all sides, joined with curses upon the\r\ngovernment which year by year, by its extravagance, snatched the\r\nhard-earned bread from the labourer’s hands.\r\n\r\n“This is all true,” replied Charles, “and is in course of being\r\nreformed: but when did even a tyrannical government inflict upon you\r\nsuch evils as you are this day inflicting upon yourselves? When has it\r\nrobbed the shops of one of the most useful class of men among you, and\r\ncarried away boat-loads of the food for which thousands are pining, and\r\ndestroyed your means of life before your eyes? A worse enemy than even a\r\nweak king and a licentious court is making sport of your miseries, and\r\noverwhelming you with such as cannot be repaired. Yes! let it not hurt\r\nyour pride to hear of woes that cannot be repaired; for even the power\r\nof the sovereign people is not unlimited, great as you have proved it to\r\nbe. You have abolished servile parliaments, and obtained a virtuous\r\nassembly of representatives. You have swept away the stronghold of\r\noppression, and can tread with free steps the turf from which its very\r\nfoundations have been extracted. You have rejected a constitution which\r\nwas an insufficient warrant for your liberties, and are in the way to\r\nobtain universal assent to that noble Declaration of Rights which shall\r\nbecome the social contract of every civilized nation.—All these things,\r\nand others which would have been called impossibilities ten years ago,\r\nyou have achieved. But there are impossibilities remaining which more\r\ntruly deserve the name. You cannot prevent multitudes dying when famine\r\nis in the land; you cannot call up a new harvest before the seed has\r\nsprouted; you cannot insist upon supplies from other lands which are\r\nalready drained. You can waste your resources, but you cannot recall\r\nthem. With however much pride or levity you may at this hour fling away\r\nthe staff of your life, you cannot retard the day when you will sink for\r\nwant of it,—when you will kneel in the mud by the brink of this very\r\ncurrent, and crave the waters to give up what you have buried in them,\r\nor to drown your miseries with your life.—Will you suffer yourselves\r\nthus to be made sport of? Will you permit yourselves to be goaded into\r\nmadness, in order that you may be ready for madmen’s deeds? Will you\r\nthrow away what is in your own hands, that others may reduce you to\r\ncrave the small pittance which will remain in theirs? Those who have\r\nincited you to the deeds of this day take very good care that all our\r\ngranaries shall not be emptied. They reserve a few, that you may at\r\nlength,—when all their schemes are ripe,—be their tools through your\r\nliteral dependence on them for bread.—Disappoint this plot as far as you\r\ncan. It is now too late to keep plenty in your own hands; but baffle the\r\napproaches of famine to the last moment; for with hunger comes slavery;\r\nor, if you will not have slavery, death; and in either case, your\r\ncountry must surrender your services at the very moment when she wants\r\nthem most.—Where is the patriotism of bringing things to this\r\npass?—Where also is the justice of condemning unheard so useful a class\r\nof men as those from whom you have taken their property without\r\naccusation, and, in many cases, their lives, on nothing better than\r\nsuspicion of their having communicated with the court?—We must respect\r\nrights, as well as frame a Declaration of them. We must cherish the\r\ninnocent and useful of society, if we wish to restrain those who are\r\nneither the one nor the other. Let there be a contrast between the\r\noppressors and the friends of the people. Let tyrants tremble, while\r\nindustrious citizens dwell in peace.”\r\n\r\nIt was now easy to wind up the discourse to the point contemplated.\r\nCharles proposed that Maigrot should be permitted, under proper\r\nguardianship, to bake a provision of loaves out of this very flour; and\r\nif they proved good, that all that remained of his property should be\r\nrestored to him. The crowd rather relished the idea of waiting the\r\noperation, in full prospect of a batch of hot rolls gratis as the\r\nresult, and the proposal was received with acclamations.—Charles\r\nimmediately singled out Maigrot, as he stood on the outskirts of the\r\nmob, requested him to lead the way homewards, put a loaf into each arm\r\nof his little son, swung a sack of flour on his own shoulders, and\r\nheaded the most singular of all the extraordinary processions which\r\nattracted the gaze of Paris in those times.\r\n\r\nThe duke of Orleans made no opposition. He saw that the game was up for\r\nthis day, and departed in an opposite direction, having no particular\r\nwish to hear the verdict which he knew would be passed upon the bread,\r\nor to witness the exultation of the baker.—Before night, Maigrot not\r\nonly felt his head safe upon his shoulders, but was the most eminent\r\nbaker in Paris; and, if he had but had any flour remaining, might have\r\nboasted such a business as he had till now never thought of aspiring to.\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                            MOB SOVEREIGNTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe endeavours of individuals like Charles to make the people wise were\r\nof little avail, however successful at the moment, in opposition to\r\ninfluences of a different character which were perpetually at work upon\r\nthe mob of Paris. The obstinacy of the king in refusing to sign the\r\ndeclaration of rights, the imbecility of the ministry, the arts and\r\nclamours of the leaders of different parties, and, above all, the\r\ndestitution of which they took advantage, overcame all principles of\r\nsubordination, all sentiments of loyalty, and filled the people with a\r\nrage which rendered them as blind to their own interests as unjust\r\ntowards those of the ranks above them. Riot and waste spread and grew\r\nfrom day to day, and the wise saw no more prospect of relief than the\r\nfoolish of danger.\r\n\r\nThe king had been told, on the day the Bastille was taken, that his\r\ncapital was in a state of revolution; but, nearly three months\r\nafterwards, he was still wondering what the event might mean; talking\r\nover with the queen the kindnesses he had always intended showing to his\r\npeople, and assuring the people’s parliament that the best thing he\r\ncould do for them was to preserve his dignity and prerogative. He could\r\nstill at Versailles ride abroad unmolested in the mornings, feast his\r\nbody-guard in the middle of the day, and look on while the ladies of the\r\ncourt were dancing in the evening, and sleep the whole night without\r\nhearing the drums and larums which kept all Paris awake; and could not\r\ntherefore believe that all would not come right, when the people should\r\nhave been persuaded of the atrocious unreasonableness of the Declaration\r\nthey wanted him to sign. When he heard that they drowned their flour in\r\nhatred of him, he did all he could think of in ordering that more should\r\nbe given them; and when the queen discovered that which every one would\r\nhave kept from her,—that she was hated,—she curled her proud lip, and\r\nreared her graceful head, and thought that the citizens must be ignorant\r\nindeed if they fancied they could understand her springs of action, or\r\nbelieved that they could intimidate her. With the dauphin at her knee,\r\nshe expatiated to the ladies of her court on the misfortune of kings and\r\nqueens having any connexion at all with the people beneath them, whom it\r\nwas at all times difficult to manage, and who might, as now, cause\r\nserious trouble, and interfere materially with the peace of royalty. She\r\nhad at that moment little idea how the peace of royalty was to be\r\ninvaded this very day.\r\n\r\nA murmur of horror and looks of dismay penetrated even into the presence\r\nof her majesty, when tidings arrived of the approach of an army of women\r\nfrom Paris.\r\n\r\n“Of women!” cried the gouvernante of the dauphin. “Is it because they\r\ncan crave bread with a shriller wail?”\r\n\r\n“Of women!” exclaimed the lady Alice de Thou. “They come to plead for\r\nthe rights of their children. I remember when they brought the little\r\nones in their arms after the storm, and we gave them all we had.”\r\n\r\n“Of women!” said the queen, thoughtfully. Then, with fire in her eyes,\r\nshe continued, looking steadfastly on the trembling chamberlain who\r\nbrought the news, “Since they are women, it is _my_ head they want. Is\r\nit not so? Speak. Are they not come for me?”\r\n\r\nAs soon as the chamberlain could speak, he muttered that he feared they\r\nwere indeed not women, but ruffians in disguise.\r\n\r\n“Aye, just so,” observed the queen. “Their womanhood is emblematical;\r\nand the hint of their purpose is not lost upon me. I hope they are\r\nindeed men, and can handle arms. I would take my death more willingly,\r\nbeing shot at as a mark, than being torn to pieces by the foul hands of\r\nthe rabble. A death-blow from afar rather than a touch from any one of\r\nthem!”\r\n\r\nAll present, except the chamberlain, were loud in their protestations\r\nagainst the possibility of any such danger. It was inconceivable; it was\r\nbarbarous; it was horrific; it was a thing unheard of; in short, it was\r\nabsolutely inconceivable. The chamberlain mournfully admitted that the\r\nwhole was indeed inconceivable to all who had not witnessed the\r\nprocession, like a troop of furies from the regions below, taking their\r\nway through every savage district on the earth, and swelling their ranks\r\nwith all that could be gathered up of hideous and corrupt. That her\r\nmajesty’s sacred person should fall into such hands——\r\n\r\nAll now began to urge flight, and the queen was for a moment disposed to\r\nlisten; but finding that the king was out shooting, had been sent for,\r\nand was expected every instant, she resolved to wait his arrival, and\r\nthen it was too late. The poissardes, real and pretended, had by that\r\ntime rushed into the place, filled the streets, stopped up the avenue,\r\nand taken up a position of control in the Chamber of Assembly. The king\r\nreached the palace through a back entrance, in safety, but it was in\r\nvain to think of leaving it again.\r\n\r\nA hasty council was summoned, consisting of the royal family, and a few\r\nconfidential servants, whose attachment to the persons of majesty might\r\nset against the enervating terror which had seized upon the ministers,\r\nand prevented their exerting any influence over these new and appalling\r\ncircumstances. Within the circle, rapid consultation went on in low\r\nvoices, while some kept watch at the doors. When discussing the\r\nnecessity of signing the declaration of rights,—which was one of the\r\ndemands of the mob without,—the queen’s manner and tone were perceived\r\nsuddenly to change, and she appeared to make light of the danger under\r\nwhich even her spirit had quailed but just before.\r\n\r\n“Be careful;” she whispered to the person next her. “There is a creature\r\nof the duke of Orleans in the room. I wonder how he got in.”\r\n\r\nThe lady Alice, who was watching her, followed the glance of her eye,\r\nand saw that it rested on one whom she little expected to see.\r\n\r\n“Madam!” she exclaimed, “it is my father!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my child; come to share your loyalty, now that the women below\r\nhave made him afraid. If the palace is stormed, he must find a refuge\r\nonce more under the Orleans provision-carts, which are, I suppose, in\r\nwaiting, as usual. We must give him no news to carry; and Alice, as soon\r\nas he is gone, I must have your head-dress to wear, as the best\r\nprotection while your father points the way to us. I would not, however,\r\nbe so cruel, my child, as to deck you with mine. You would lose your\r\npretty head in a trice, and then the marquis would altogether go from\r\nus. It is through you that we are still favoured with his countenance\r\noccasionally.”\r\n\r\nAlice’s tearful eyes had besought mercy for her parent long before the\r\nqueen seemed disposed to yield it. While the adherence of the noblesse\r\nto the royal cause was regarded as a matter of course, and therefore not\r\nrewarded with extraordinary gratitude, all symptoms of halting or\r\ndefection were observed with scorn, and commented on without reserve by\r\nthe haughty woman who regarded her rank and empire as natural, instead\r\nof conventional, and would as soon have dreamed of being denied the use\r\nof her limbs and senses as the privileges of royalty.\r\n\r\nIt was through her influence that the king refused to sign the\r\ndeclaration till the last moment,—when he was compelled to do so at a\r\ntremendous sacrifice of regal dignity;—at the bidding, namely, of twelve\r\npoissardes who forced their way into the presence with the deputies from\r\nthe Assembly, and under the compulsion of threats of what might be\r\nexpected from the army of eighteen thousand men who had marched from\r\nParis during the afternoon, under the enforced command of Lafayette.\r\n\r\nNever was anything beheld more dreary than the aspect, more disgusting\r\nthan the incidents of this day and night. The skies frowned upon the\r\nscene, and wind and rain added to the difficulty of what was achieved,\r\nand the horror of what was witnessed. The deputies and their attendants,\r\nthe poissardes, appeared in the king’s presence, covered with mud and\r\ndrenched with rain; the House of Assembly was crowded with women, who\r\ncame in for shelter, taking their seats among the members, now eating\r\nand drinking, and now lifting up an outcry to drown the voice of an\r\nunpopular deputy; the fires of the bivouacs in the streets were quenched\r\nwith torrents of rain, again and again, and the peaceable inhabitants\r\nwere in fear of being compelled at length to throw open their gates to\r\nthe rabble. The leading figure of the mob, however, had a peculiar\r\nreason for disliking the weather, as he took care to show everybody. He\r\nwas a gaunt-looking ruffian, with a high pointed cap, and grotesque\r\ngarb, well armed, but especially proud of an axe which he carried, ready\r\nfor immediate use at the slightest hint from the leaders of the mob.\r\nWith all his fear,—the only fear he seemed capable of,—that it should be\r\nrusted with the wet, and he thus delayed in his vocation, he could not\r\nrefrain from brandishing it over his head, and displaying it in sight of\r\nthe sentinels, and such of the body-guards as looked out now and then\r\nfrom the palace. This ruffian took his stand immediately under the\r\nking’s window, prepared a cannon as a convenient block, and waited\r\nimpatiently for victims. He could not be persuaded to quit his post for\r\nshelter; but he did once step aside for brandy. On his return, he found\r\ntwo poissardes sitting astride on his cannon, face to face, tossing off\r\ntheir drams, and devouring the rations which their prompting demon had\r\ntaken care to provide. The executioner warned them off, and prevailed by\r\nthe offer of a better seat within five minutes. A hint was enough to\r\nshow them his meaning. He just pointed towards an approaching group,\r\nconsisting of an unfortunate soldier with whom some of the mob had\r\npicked a quarrel as he was going to his post for the night,—and his\r\ncaptors. The victim looked dogged. He saw the cold metal block on which\r\nthe axe was presently to ring his death-stroke: he saw the fidgetty\r\nexecutioner, and the fierce women, gathering round, munching their\r\nsuppers as if his life-blood was the draught they looked for to wash\r\ndown the last mouthful: he saw that no help was within reach or call. He\r\nsaw all this, and seemed disposed to take quietly, though sullenly, what\r\nwas inevitable. He stood firm while they pulled off his stock; he moved\r\nforwards when they pushed him; he kneeled when they pressed upon his\r\nshoulders; but some impatience in their manner of doing so excited his\r\npassions in a moment to their utmost strength. Before they could keep\r\nhim down, he was not only on his feet again, but bounding high in the\r\nair, grappling with the executioner for the axe, kicking, trampling,\r\nbuffeting all who laid hands on him, and creating a hubbub which brought\r\nthe king to the window above, and conveyed to the senses of the ladies a\r\nknowledge of what was passing. It was a short struggle; but a struggle\r\nit was to the last, and force alone could subdue the victim. One virago\r\nclutched the hair of his head, and others held down his feet. When his\r\nblood flowed on the ground, and mixed with the puddles of rain, one or\r\ntwo stooped down to see how the eyes rolled and the nostrils yet\r\nquivered, while, on the other side the block, the executioner, mindful\r\nof his promise, tossed the headless body to a little distance, so that\r\nhis friends might sit on it to finish their meal. What are the invisible\r\nissues of life there was no one present to think, during the whole\r\nscene, unless the victim himself might have been conscious of his\r\nthoughts darting that way; but such was the visible issue of a life\r\nwhich a stupendous and delicate natural apparatus had been appointed to\r\ncreate, sustain, and develop. It had originated in the deepest passions\r\nof human nature; been maintained by appliances, both natural and moral,\r\nwhich the keenest powers can barely recognize, and not estimate; and\r\ndeveloped for objects of which man has only the remotest ken. Such was\r\nthe visible issue of this mighty series of operations. That the handy\r\nwork of Providence should ever have been thus crushed, and its mysteries\r\nthus boldly made sport of, may in time appear as incredible as it would\r\nnow seem that children had ever been encouraged to pull planets from\r\ntheir spheres in mockery, and quench the milky way,—supposing such power\r\nto have been left in their hands. In the latter case, who would be\r\nanswerable for the profanation? Surely those who taught mockery in the\r\nplace of reverence. Who then was answerable in the former case? Those\r\nwho made the perpetrators ignorant through oppression, and savage by\r\nmisrule. The responsibilities of a certain order through many centuries\r\nwere called to judgment during the brief period before us; and the\r\nsentence of condemnation not only went forth on the four winds to the\r\nfarthest corners of the globe, but shall be repeated down to those\r\nremote ages when it shall be forgotten on earth, though recorded in\r\nheaven, that man ever shed the blood of man.\r\n\r\nOne or two more such murders on the cannon and at the palace gates had\r\nnot the effect of alarming the court or the really patriotic leaders of\r\nthe people so far as to keep them on the watch through the night. The\r\nking believed that all was safe when he had given the signature which it\r\nwas the professed object of the expedition to obtain. The queen was\r\nassured by Lafayette that the people were wearied, and that nothing was\r\nto be apprehended till morning; and the general himself reposed in his\r\nhotel in full confidence of the security of all parties. All were not,\r\nhowever, thus satisfied. Some of the deputies refused to withdraw from\r\ntheir chamber; and while all was sleep and silence in the palace, except\r\nwhere some watchful ear caught the soft tread of the sentinels in the\r\ncorridors, and the pattering of the rain without, and at intervals, some\r\ntidings from the passing gust, of revelry in the streets,—while armed\r\nruffians sang their songs, or snored in their dreams round the\r\nwatch-fires where the shrill-voiced poissardes were broiling their\r\nrations, or heating their strong liquors,—a few of the wiser deputies\r\nsat, each in his place, with folded arms, and in perfect silence, while\r\nthe light of a single lamp fell on their uncovered heads and thoughtful\r\ncountenances, and foresight was invisibly presenting to each pictures of\r\nthat which was about to befall their monarchy and themselves. Revellers,\r\nlegislators, and sentinels were not the only ones who watched. One or\r\ntwo, who did not partake the general’s confidence in the people thus\r\nstrangely congregated, wandered from watch-fire to watch-fire, and about\r\nthe precincts of the palace, to be in readiness to warn Lafayette of the\r\nfirst symptoms of movement.\r\n\r\nAmong these was Charles, whose anxiety had been awakened by the aspect\r\nof Paris after the departure of the army for Versailles. It was well\r\nknown that Lafayette’s generalship on this occasion was enforced; and\r\nnot all the apparatus of triumph amidst which the troops marched\r\nout,—not all the drumming, and military music, and display of flags\r\namidst the rain, and echo of shouting heard above the strong winds,\r\ncould remove the impression of the hollowness of all this rejoicing,—the\r\ndesperation of this defiance. When the sights and sounds were gone, a\r\ndeep gloom settled down upon Paris. The shops were shut, the streets\r\nwere silent, except where the waggons, laden with meat, bread, and\r\nbrandy, converged towards the Versailles road, or where groups of two or\r\nthree observers whispered their anticipations to each other, mindful of\r\nnone but political storms, and questioning only whether the sun of\r\nroyalty would not this night have a crimson setting, to rise upon their\r\nstate no more.\r\n\r\nCharles had been among these observers, and the tidings he brought home\r\nmade his wife anxious to depart from this revolutionary city, and take\r\nrefuge in their country possessions. She would be ready to go at any\r\nmoment, she declared, and when would there be so favourable a time as\r\nwhen the place was half emptied of its inhabitants, the police otherwise\r\nengaged than in watching the proceedings of private individuals, and all\r\nfear at an end of any attack upon the wine-stores? Charles was half\r\ndisposed to listen to the scheme, though his views of what was likely to\r\nhappen differed as widely from his wife’s as the prevailing tone of mind\r\nby which they were influenced. Marguerite feared the worst: her husband\r\nhoped all might yet be well, and thought it, at all events, a good thing\r\nthat something decided must arise out of the present crisis. He\r\ndetermined to follow the march to Versailles, and to return as soon as\r\nhe could anticipate the event, to bid Marguerite stay and make herself\r\neasy, or to carry her, her father and children into Guienne. While she\r\nwas packing up the few necessaries she meant to take with her, and\r\npersuading all the household but herself to go early to rest, Charles\r\nwas reconnoitring the proceedings of such as were preparing a terrible\r\nretribution for those under whose tyranny they had suffered.\r\n\r\nHe was no spy; being devoted to no party, and acting for his own honest\r\npurposes; and he therefore used no concealment. He conversed with the\r\nriotous poissardes on public injuries, conferred with the deputies on\r\npublic order, and exchanged a few words with the sentinels on the\r\nprobability of an attack on the palace in the morning. The horrible\r\nthreats breathed over the fires against the queen, the brutal exultation\r\nwhich appeared through mysterious and slang expressions respecting the\r\nroyal household, made him wonder at the apparent defencelessness of the\r\npalace. He was by no means satisfied that all was safe till morning, and\r\nsaid so to a little muffled up man whom he found standing in the shadow,\r\nclose by the great iron gates. He could not make out whether this man\r\nwas a mere looker on, like himself, or a watch appointed by either\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n“Is it your own choice to be out to-night, sir; or are you occupying a\r\npost? Because, in the first case I would direct you where you might see\r\nmore of the state of things than here; and, in the other, I would\r\nstrongly recommend your appealing to the general for support.”\r\n\r\n“Alas! yes. I am sent hither,” replied the quavering voice of the\r\nmuffled up person. “None would willingly be abroad this night, and all\r\nmy desire is to be left unobserved in this shadow at present;—unless,\r\nindeed, some friend should pass who might protect me, and from whom I\r\nmight learn that which I am sent to ascertain.—You seem, sir, to be an\r\norderly, honest man. Can you tell me whether the duke,—whether Orleans\r\nis at hand?”\r\n\r\n“Orleans being the most honest and orderly of men, hey, marquis?” said\r\nCharles, laughing. “So you are sent out by lady Alice for tidings, and\r\nyou wait here for them till Orleans passes by—Is it not so?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! what can I do? These canaille will smother me again with flour, or\r\ndrag me to the cold cannon;” and here the little man shivered, and his\r\nteeth chattered. “Do but bring me to Orleans, my good sir, or get me a\r\nre-entrance into the palace, and I will——I will——This morning air is so\r\nraw! and I am——I am——not fit for enterprise.”\r\n\r\nCharles fully agreed with him; but having no interest to get a royal spy\r\nhoused before his errand was done, he could only tell him that, to the\r\nbest of his belief, Orleans was lingering about the road between\r\nVersailles and Paris, or hanging somewhere on the outskirts of the\r\nencampment to witness the issue, without being implicated.\r\n\r\n“Ah! how he is happy in comparison with me!” cried the poor marquis. “I\r\nhave never, sir, meddled with politics——”\r\n\r\n“Further than as all the noblesse have operated,” interrupted Charles.\r\n“I mean in stimulating the people to meddle with politics. You have\r\nwrought at second hand, marquis, hitherto. Now is your time for taking\r\nyour part finally, and acting in it.”\r\n\r\n“Alas! what evils come of any one interfering in such affairs but\r\nministers and deputies! Let them act, and let us be neutral. This is all\r\nI ask.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, but, marquis, it is too late to ask this; because there has been\r\ngreat mistake about what is, and what is not, being neutral. I dare say\r\nyou believed yourself neutral when you lay sleeping in bed, while your\r\npeasantry were keeping the frogs quiet in your ponds. I dare say you had\r\nno thought of politics in your boar hunts, or when three fathers of\r\nfamilies were sent to the galleys for alarming the lady Alice’s brooding\r\ndoves. Yet you were all the while——”\r\n\r\nThe marquis’s light blue eyes were now seen by the lamp light to be\r\nopened upon Charles with such an expression of vacant wonderment that it\r\nwas plain there was no use in proceeding. He evidently had yet to learn\r\nthe true province of politics; and, for his part, he thought the\r\nmerchant must have drunk a little too deep in his own wine, to be\r\ntalking of peasants and pigeons in connexion with an insurrection in\r\nParis.—He would never have had courage to leave his nook by himself; but\r\nnow that he had met a face that he knew, it required more courage to\r\nremain there by himself, and he therefore hooked Charles by the arm, and\r\nsaid he would be wholly guided by him. Charles would rather have\r\ndispensed with his attachment, but could not shake off the old man into\r\ndarkness and helplessness, if he himself preferred venturing into the\r\nlight of the watch-fires, and upon the threshold of Lafayette’s lodging,\r\nwhither he was warned he would be conveyed.\r\n\r\nIf the marquis had carried a bold front, nothing would have happened to\r\nhim, any more than to his companion; but his slouched hat, halting gait,\r\nand shrinking deportment at once drew attention upon him. The\r\nconsequence was that he heard double the number of threats, and\r\nimprecations ten times more horrid than had met Charles’s ears before.\r\nIf he had now regained entrance into the palace, he could have told that\r\nwhich would have made even the queen’s fiery blood run cold, and have\r\ngiven the whole household a foretaste of worse horrors than even those\r\nof the ensuing day.\r\n\r\nWhen they had arrived at the last of the line of fires, the marquis\r\nbelieved his purgatory to be nearly over, and indulged himself in a few\r\nejaculations of thankfulness on the occasion. He was overheard, seized,\r\ndragged to the light, his coat torn open, and his hat pushed back. The\r\nqueue looked suspicious; the manner of speech, mixed up, as even these\r\npeople could perceive, of high breeding and imbecility, gave assurance\r\nthat he was a court adherent; to which there was to be opposed only his\r\nown and Charles’s assurance that he was a companion and friend of\r\nOrleans. The knot of drinkers hesitated whether to cut off his head or\r\nlet him go, and the marquis stood panting with open lips and closed\r\nteeth, when an amiable creature, partly masculine in her attire, and\r\nwholly so in her address, proposed a half measure.\r\n\r\n“If he is one of them,” she observed, “we shall find him again in the\r\npalace presently; so let us mark him.”\r\n\r\nWith the word, she seized the poor man’s nose with the left hand, a\r\nburning stick with the right, and branded his forehead with a cross;\r\nthen pushed him away, and turned to Charles, offering to drink to him in\r\nhis own liquor, the choicest in Paris, if Orleans said true. She pointed\r\nat the same time to a waggon near, on which, to his amazement, Charles\r\nsaw piled wine-casks with his own mark, and brandy-bottles sealed with\r\nhis own seal.\r\n\r\nPerceiving at a glance that his cellars must have been forced since he\r\nleft home, and that all further resistance would be useless, he\r\ndetermined to yield to his wife’s desire to quit Paris; and he hastened\r\nto discharge his duty of rousing and warning the general, before turning\r\nhis back on this scene of disorder.\r\n\r\nLafayette was up in a moment, and, though still trusting in the\r\npeaceable disposition of the people, dressed himself hastily, that he\r\nmight be among them by daybreak. Before he could leave his hotel,\r\nhowever, warning sounds came from the direction of the palace, and\r\nmessengers succeeded one another rapidly, stating that an attack was\r\nbeing made on the great iron gates, that blood had already been shed,\r\nand that the lives of the whole royal family seemed to be at the\r\npeople’s mercy. The general threw himself upon a horse which happened to\r\nbe standing saddled below, and galloped off, before Charles could\r\nrecommend the marquis de Thou to his protection, should he happen to\r\nfind him in the hands of the populace. His own anxiety to get home was\r\nsuch as ill to brook any delay, and to admit little other interest of\r\nany kind; but chance threw him once more in the path of the old man.\r\n\r\nAs he was making the best of his way towards the Paris road, stemming\r\nthe tide of people that was rushing towards the palace, he was suddenly\r\njostled and thrown down by an impulse in the contrary direction. Nor was\r\nhe the only one. Many were bruised, some trampled, while a fugitive\r\nburst through the throng, followed by a knot of pursuers, who overthrew\r\nall that came in their way, while their mingled curses and laughter\r\ncontrasted strangely with the panting cry of the pursued. Some cried out\r\nthat it was the king; others uttered imprecations against him as one of\r\nthe hated guards; while Charles saw, amidst his tattered, scared, and\r\nhelpless condition, that it was no other than the poor marquis. His\r\ndesperation gave the hunted man strength to clear the mob, and to fly\r\nsome way beyond, till he reached the trees of the avenue, where there\r\nwas an end of his safety unless some better aid was brought him than his\r\nown failing strength. His enemies dogged him, surrounded him;—some\r\nbrandishing pitchforks, others large knives, and not a few firing off\r\ntheir muskets to give a new impulse to his terror. This sight was\r\nintolerable to Charles, who saw in such cruelty none of the palliations\r\nwhich he had admitted in the case of some former acts of violence.\r\nForgetting all but what was before his eyes, he snatched a pike, threw\r\nhimself in front of the pursuit, reached the victim just as he fell\r\nexhausted at the foot of a tree, and stood astride over him, with one\r\nhand in an attitude of defence, while the other beckoned to the people\r\nto listen. He shouted amid the din, and the few words which were heard\r\nby those nearest to him served his purpose of diverting their thoughts\r\nfrom immediate murder. He told them that, in the name of the marquis’s\r\ntenantry, he demanded that the marquis should be placed in the custody\r\nof the Assembly of deputies, to answer for an infringement of the new\r\nlaws by which the property of the peasantry was protected. He told them\r\nthat the general was gone to the palace, to mediate between the queen\r\nand the poissardes, and as it would be a pity that those who heard him\r\nshould be absent from so interesting a spectacle, he and one or two more\r\nwould take charge of the criminal, and convey him before the sitting\r\ndeputies. A well-timed roll of the drums and discharge of musketry\r\nconfirmed his appeal, and drew away his auditors, so that in a few\r\nmoments, when the last lingerers had gratified themselves with pricking\r\ntheir victim a little with the points of their various weapons, Charles\r\nfound himself alone with the almost lifeless old man.\r\n\r\nOn hearing that his further existence probably depended on his reaching\r\nthe assembly while the mob was engaged elsewhere, the marquis made an\r\neffort to rise and walk, and found himself so much less hurt than\r\nfrightened that he accomplished the transit with small difficulty. Such\r\na deplorable object was never before presented to the Assembly, at least\r\nunder the title of a marquis. He had scarcely a shred of clothing under\r\nthe soldier’s cloak which Charles had borrowed from a sentinel at the\r\ndoor. His powdered hair was dripping with rain, and his face smeared\r\nwith blood. He wept bitterly; murmuring, in the tones of a woman, his\r\nwonder as to what he could have ever done to offend the people, and how\r\nthe world could have grown so cruel and ungrateful. The Assembly had\r\nlittle leisure at this time, and were glad to accept Charles’s offer of\r\nconveying the prisoner away, and his guarantee that the marquis should\r\nset out for his estate in the provinces without delay, and not return\r\ntill the troubles of the capital were at an end. The marquis was little\r\ndisposed to make opposition.\r\n\r\n“Take me away,” he said, “though I only fly from one doom to another.\r\nYou say my tenants are enraged against me; and I say that they will\r\ndrink my blood. The vile are sovereigns in these days, and the noble\r\nhave the knife at their throats from day to day. O, if they had killed\r\nme under the tree, it would have been over; but now it is still to come.\r\nO save me! Do not leave me! Make me your servant. Employ me as you will;\r\nbut do not let them kill me!”\r\n\r\nCharles recommended that the old man should in fact travel into Guienne\r\nas his servant, and take possession of his chateau or not, according to\r\nthe apparent disposition of the peasantry when they should arrive.—Not a\r\nmoment was to be lost in proceeding to Paris, if the departure of the\r\nfamily was to take place while the populace and the troops were engaged\r\nat Versailles, and the whole attention of the magistracy was directed\r\nupon what was passing there.\r\n\r\nAn empty cart was found in which to stow the marquis, while his\r\nprotector walked by its side. They left behind them the most fearful\r\nspectacles of that day,—the murder of some of the guards, the narrow\r\nescape of the queen, the brutal joy of the mob at the enforced consent\r\nof the royal family to be conveyed to Paris, and the beginning of that\r\ndreadful march itself, as anomalous, as disgusting, as any spectacle\r\nthat was ever presented as a pageant. But, one circumstance which\r\nsignalized that march, they were also witnesses to. Half-way between\r\nVersailles and Paris, on a mound planted with trees, a figure was seen,\r\nmoving behind the stems, and peeping forth at every sound of wheels or\r\nfootsteps. It was Orleans, who had stationed himself here to watch the\r\nissue of his plot,—the return of the expedition, with the bodies of his\r\nroyal cousins, dead or alive.\r\n\r\nWith some difficulty, he was persuaded to come down and speak to his\r\nhumble servant the marquis; and when he did greet him, it was with\r\nsomething very like a smile at his crest-fallen appearance, and\r\nquerulous complainings.\r\n\r\n“My good friend, these are strange times,” he observed. “I should think\r\nyour valet has hardly had time to attend to you this morning. However,\r\nyou will find plenty unoccupied at Paris to renew your powder.—O, you\r\nwish to go at once, and shoot on your own territory. Well; perhaps you\r\nare wise, since our kind of shooting here is not exactly to your taste.\r\nYou must take care, however; for I hear that more bullets fly from\r\nbehind the hedges there than in the open fields. Farewell, my dear sir,\r\nfor I see your companion is impatient. He wants to be keeping guard over\r\nhis wine-cellars. I wish him an ample fortune out of the wines therein\r\ncontained at this moment.”\r\n\r\nCharles’s impatience was not only on account of his own affairs. He\r\ndistrusted Orleans so far as to be vexed that the marquis whispered to\r\nhim their plan of escape. There was no particular sign of interest in\r\nthe duke’s countenance at the relation; and it only remained to be hoped\r\nthat no harm would come of this unnecessary confidence. The marquis was\r\nfar from thinking it unnecessary, as a word from the duke would procure\r\npassports for the whole family. This word Orleans was prevailed upon to\r\nwrite, and furnished with it, the marquis poured out his gratitude more\r\nvehemently than, but a few months before, he would have supposed\r\npossible; and then bade his vehicle proceed, watching from a distance\r\nhow the duke once more passed the enclosure, and took his station among\r\nthe trees as before.\r\n\r\nThe cellars were found to be indeed more than half emptied; and of the\r\ncasks that remained, one or two were staved, to drown the gunpowder and\r\nother combustibles. No attack had been made upon the house, and\r\nMarguerite had sufficiently got the better of her terrors, to be ready\r\nfor immediate departure. No obstacle arose, and Steele, with Pierre\r\nunder him, consented to remain in charge of the property till Charles\r\ncould return, after having deposited his family in security.\r\n\r\nThe marquis made a rather singular-looking valet, with a manner\r\nalternating between superciliousness and awkward deference,—a strutting\r\ngait when he forgot what he was about, and a cringing one when he\r\nhappened to cast a glance upon his dress. He passed muster very well,\r\nhowever, as a battered old soldier turned valet; his strut passing for\r\nregimental paces, and his cringe being ascribed to the honourable wounds\r\nhe was supposed to bear. M. Raucourt took off the attention of all who\r\nmight be disposed to make remarks, by telling everybody that he was\r\ngoing to see his olive groves. The party travelled with more speed than\r\nthe dismal procession from Versailles; so that before the royal family\r\nwas mournfully ushered into the Hotel de Ville at dusk, Charles and his\r\nhousehold were some leagues on their journey southwards.\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                          UPSHOT OF FEUDALISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hopeful disposition of both Charles and Antoine was remarkable at\r\nall times, and in whatever society they were. When they were together,\r\nit became well nigh excessive, and occasioned no little amusement to\r\ntheir friends in happy times, and much sighing from the apprehensive\r\nMarguerite in such evil days as they were now fallen upon. Each excited\r\nthe other to perceive bright specks on the dark horizon, and neither\r\nwould lag behind the other in discerning cause for encouragement, and in\r\npointing out that, as good had issued from apparent evil in some former\r\nanalogous instance, it would be a sin to doubt that the same thing might\r\nhappen again. Marguerite was almost offended that, while she looked\r\ntremblingly around as the dancing waters of the Garonne first flashed\r\nupon their sight under the gleam of an October sun, her husband\r\nencouraged the joyous gestures of the children standing on his knee, and\r\nburst out singing one of the popular provincial airs to which the banks\r\nof that river so often echo. But when Antoine came forth to meet them as\r\nthey alighted, in high spirits, though he had actually nothing good to\r\ntell them, however disposed to hope for everything blissful, Marguerite\r\nturned from him to her father, as the most reasonable personage of the\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nAntoine was beginning a laugh at his brother’s first choice of the\r\nluxury of a valet, but checked himself instantly on hearing who it was,\r\nand wherefore.\r\n\r\n“Do you suppose he may safely dress himself, and appear to arrive at his\r\nchateau to-morrow?”\r\n\r\n“Why, scarcely yet, perhaps,” replied Antoine, gravely. “The peasantry\r\nare in an uncomfortable, irascible state, and the poor man would hardly\r\nhave fair play among them; but it cannot last long, and then we shall\r\nhave him trampling our crops again as solemnly as ever; perched, like a\r\nwax figure, on horseback, and utterly unable to comprehend such a thing\r\nas a curse against himself; or to bestow a thought as to whose ground he\r\nis trespassing upon.”\r\n\r\n“Let us hope he has learned more consideration by his misfortunes,” said\r\nCharles. “At any rate, he may yet learn it by using his eyes and ears in\r\nthe interval between this hour and his restoration to his honours and\r\nprivileges,—which I suppose will happen by the time he has learned to\r\ntie his own queue according to his own fancy. Meanwhile, how is\r\nFavorite?”\r\n\r\n“O, our beauty! She has rather languished this season; but she will be\r\nall the more brilliant next year; for two bad seasons give a pretty fair\r\nsecurity that the third will be good. It is as if the steam of blood had\r\ncome from your city, Charles, like a blight, and shrivelled her swelling\r\nfruit. The crisis is come, you say. There will soon be no more blood,\r\nand wine will gush instead. Yes, yes, next season all will be well.”\r\n\r\n“But our peasant neighbours, Antoine. Has their condition improved as\r\nyou were confident it would?”\r\n\r\n“How should it yet? The time is not come. They have not yet got over the\r\nscarcity of last year. But the woodcocks will soon be here; and the lady\r\nAlice’s doves multiply all the faster now they are left to themselves;\r\nand in the spring, there will be a greater resource of cattle, and of\r\ntheir milk; and the bad seasons have not destroyed our fish. We are\r\nplanning to get larger and larger supplies from Bordeaux, as well as to\r\nsend out more boats upon the river.”\r\n\r\n“Corn is too dear, at present, I suppose, for the poor, if indeed you\r\nhave enough for the rich?”\r\n\r\n“We are all somewhat better off in that respect than we were; but a\r\ngreat part of the discontent arises from the incessant changes in the\r\nvalue of whatever we get to eat, as long as the supply is turned out of\r\nits usual course. When we can no longer depend on an article whose\r\nsupply is usually pretty regular, and its price not very variable, we\r\nare subject to a perpetual rise and fall which we cannot calculate, and\r\nwhich brings disappointments to the people which they are ill able to\r\nbear.”\r\n\r\n“How do you mean? I thought our poor helped out their subsistence by\r\nnettle broth and frog stew; and for these, I suppose, they pay neither\r\nlabour nor money?”\r\n\r\n“No; but they must have something in addition. Presently it will be\r\nwoodcocks—the most uncertain article of food that can be. If there\r\nshould be a fine flight of them to be had for the killing, labour will\r\nbecome cheaper to us capitalists, while the labourers will be better\r\nrewarded: that is, it will cost us less to feed our labourers, while\r\nthey will get more food for an equal quantity of labour. This, while it\r\nlasts, lessens the cost of production, and if it went on a whole year,\r\nwould cheapen our corn considerably next harvest. But the resource lasts\r\na very short time, and the reduction of the price of corn, therefore, is\r\nonly of that temporary kind which proceeds from a relaxation of demand.\r\nBefore the people well understand how this is, the cattle begin to come\r\nin from the woods,—more numerous than ever, from so much arable land\r\nhaving, since the storm, yielded a kind of rude pasture. This is a\r\nsomewhat less uncertain resource than the woodcocks, and lowers the\r\nvalue of corn for a longer period. What I want, to fill up the intervals\r\nof these uncertain supplies, is a permanent provision of fish.”\r\n\r\n“How strangely the values of things are turned topsy-turvy!” exclaimed\r\nCharles. “Time was when our peasantry would no more have thought of\r\ndining off woodcocks than I of giving my servants a daily dessert of\r\npine-apples. Dainty game of that sort is commonly thought to rise in\r\nvalue with the progress of improvement.”\r\n\r\n“And so it does; and that it now exchanges for less either of money or\r\nbread, than the commonest sorts of meat did three years ago, is a proof\r\nthat our condition has gone back instead of improving. It is a proof\r\nthat the produce of our toil is scantier than it was; that the produce\r\nwhich we cannot command—that which comes and goes without our will and\r\npleasure—exchanges for less when there are more to demand it.”\r\n\r\n“We may say the same of cattle.”\r\n\r\n“Just at present; because our cattle is for the most part wild, having\r\ngot abroad into the woods at the time of the hurricane. But when we have\r\ncollected our flocks and herds again, and can attend to their breeding,\r\nso as to proportion the supply to the demand, we shall find their value\r\npermanently depend, like that of the crops with which they will then be\r\nfed, on the cost of production.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, if they feed on crops grown for their use. At present, when\r\nthey pasture themselves on land which would otherwise lie waste, they\r\nare cheap when there happens to be, a sufficient supply of fish and\r\nwoodcocks, because there is little cost of production;—no rent, little\r\ncapital, and less labour. Any sudden rise of value proceeds from a\r\ntemporary increase of demand. It is to equalize the demand for butcher’s\r\nmeat, that I and some of my neighbours want to procure a regular supply\r\nof fish.”\r\n\r\n“Yet fish is an article whose value rises with the progress of\r\nimprovement. It must do so in proportion as more labour is required to\r\nprocure an equal supply for an extended market. As years pass on,\r\nAntoine, we shall have to fit out more boats for the river, and to build\r\nthem larger, and man them better, as we have to send them out farther.\r\nBut then there will be more of other things to give in exchange for\r\nfish.”\r\n\r\n“True; but at present we cannot give our fishermen what they think a\r\nfair premium upon their cost of production, because our cost of\r\nproduction, the cost of the labour we give in exchange, is\r\nextraordinarily high.”\r\n\r\n“Do they complain of the price you give?”\r\n\r\n“Very much, but that cannot be helped. We complained of their _social\r\nprice_ in old days,—of having to pay, not only the profits and wages\r\nnecessary to procure the article, but the market dues, which were very\r\noppressive. They answered that they did not pocket the dues, and could\r\nnot help the high price. Now they complain that (the dues being lately\r\nremitted) they cannot even secure their _natural price_,—that is, a\r\nreasonable profit in addition to the cost of the labour.”\r\n\r\n“If they cannot do this, why do they supply you? They will not surely go\r\non furnishing the market with fish at prime cost.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not, for any length of time; but, till the woodcocks come,\r\nthey must submit to wear out their boats a little, without an\r\nequivalent, looking forward to the time when we may again afford them a\r\nfair market price,—which will, by that time, be a money price; for then\r\nwe shall be able to get out of our present inconvenient state of barter,\r\nand the coin which has disappeared will have found its way back.”\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile, the people, you say, are discontented as much at the\r\nfluctuations in their affairs as at their absolute want of many\r\ncomforts.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; we hear perpetual complaints that no man can now calculate how\r\nmuch his labour is worth. So many hours’ work will one week bring him\r\ntwo good meals, and at another, not half an one. If they go into the\r\nwoods for game, so many head may to-day exchange for a coat,—to-morrow\r\nfor a house.”\r\n\r\n“Much of this hap-hazard must also be owing to the uncertainty of public\r\naffairs. If we could but foresee whether we really have arrived at the\r\ncrisis,—whether trade will probably flow into its natural channels again\r\nafter a certain fixed period, our condition would immediately improve.\r\nThere is no other such effectual regulator of price as clear\r\nanticipation, because it enables us to calculate the ultimate cost of\r\nproduction, on which exchangeable value finally depends.”\r\n\r\nAntoine observed, in a low voice, that the most suffering of his poor\r\nneighbours had lately begun to indulge in a new sort of anticipation.\r\nThey had been told,—and nobody was aware whence the report arose, that\r\nthere was a room full of coin in the chateau of the marquis de Thou.\r\nTheir own coin had somehow gone away from them, and they fancied that,\r\nif they could but get any instead of it, all their woes would\r\nimmediately cease. Antoine had reason to believe that the chateau would\r\nsoon be attacked, unless some means of undeceiving the poor creatures\r\ncould be discovered.\r\n\r\nThe brothers comforted themselves, according to their wont, that such\r\nmeans could not fail soon to present themselves. It was impossible that\r\nso gross an error could long subsist. Their confidence did not make them\r\nthe less watchful to aid the enlightenment of the people around them;\r\nfor their hopefulness was of that kind which stimulates instead of\r\nsuperseding exertion. La Favorite experienced this; for, amidst all\r\ntheir hopes of what her beauty would be next year, they toiled to repair\r\nher losses and renovate her vegetative forces. Charles could not have\r\nbrought himself to return to Paris till this was done, even if he had\r\nbeen satisfied to leave Marguerite in charge of the marquis.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman chose soon to free the family from his presence, against\r\ntheir advice; even in the face of their strong remonstrances. Like many\r\nwho are deficient in physical courage and mental strength, he was rash\r\nand obstinate. As soon as he had recovered from his astonishment at not\r\nbeing killed on the day of his arrival, he began to be certain that\r\nthere was no further danger, and, blind to the manifold tokens of his\r\nextreme unpopularity, which might have greeted his senses and\r\nunderstanding at any hour of any day, he determined on secretly quitting\r\nhis disguise, without troubling his kind friends to reason any further\r\nwith him. One morning, accordingly, his valet’s dress was found on the\r\nfloor of his chamber, and on his table, a note of ample, though haughty\r\nthanks to his preservers; and by noon, the marquis’s old steed, bearing\r\na rider whose skirts, blue eyes, and entire deportment could not be\r\nmistaken, was seen to trample new ploughed fields, and give promise of\r\nriding over heedless children, as before.\r\n\r\nThe last thing that entered the old man’s head was altering his modes of\r\nprocedure in any one respect. He could not escort lady Alice, because\r\nshe was not there; but he paced the terrace, in an afternoon, with his\r\nhead half turned, as if he saw her ghost beside him. He could not lead a\r\nlong train of hunters, because some of them were in Austria, some in\r\nEngland, and one or two already laid headless in a bloody grave; but he\r\ngalloped forth on the same routes, making the most of the two or three\r\nservants who followed him still, and returning in state to sit solitary\r\nat the head of a long table, and toast his own loyal sentiments. What\r\nwas worse,—he trampled his poor neighbours when they came in his way,\r\nand overlooked them when they did not, as if he had never been branded\r\nby a poissarde, or hunted in the avenue at Versailles.\r\n\r\nAll this, it may be supposed, soon came to an end,—and by means which\r\nproved the error of the popular belief about the chamber full of gold at\r\nthe chateau. Out of pure humanity, Charles repeatedly vanquished his\r\nresentment at the marquis’s supercilious treatment of him, and offered\r\nwarnings of the blackening gloom which settled in the faces of the\r\npeasantry when the little great man came in sight; but the marquis had\r\ngot it into his head that Charles had an interest in frightening him. He\r\nthought he had been more frightened than most men already, and wisely\r\ndetermined to be so no more. He bowed, laid his hand on his heart,\r\ndisengaged his rein from the friendly grasp, and passed on.\r\n\r\n“My hopefulness is nothing to his, Marguerite, after all,” observed\r\nCharles. “You say I hope against hope. He hopes against reason. The\r\ndifference is that the one hope will vanish when most wanted, and the\r\nother, I trust, never wear out.”\r\n\r\nOne night, when there was no moon,—one of the longest winter nights,—no\r\nmoon was wanted for a space of some miles on the banks of the Garonne.\r\nInstead of the boats sailing black in the silver beam, they passed\r\ncrimson in the fiery glare. The sheeted snow glittered and sparkled as\r\nif it had been noon instead of midnight: the groves dropped their melted\r\nburden, and stood stiff and stark in wintry bareness, stripped of the\r\nfeathery lightness in which they had risen against the evening sky.\r\nCries which ill beseem the hour of sleep roused the night-birds, and\r\nvolumes of red smoke spread themselves abroad to eclipse the stars.\r\nCharles’s steps were directed towards the chateau before he had received\r\nany notice, but from his own apprehensions, whence the fire proceeded\r\nwhich had scared his children from their beds. He arrived in the\r\ncourt-yard,—not in time to save the marquis, but to speak with him once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThe old man was bound to the balustrade of his own terrace; and an\r\nexecutioner stood beside him with an upraised and gleaming sword. His\r\nappearance was much what it had been on a nearly similar occasion\r\nbefore. He attempted to spring forward, and a gleam of hope shot across\r\nhis countenance when the brothers appeared: but there was a something in\r\ntheir faces which checked the emotion, and his jaw dropped once more.\r\n\r\nAll efforts, all stratagems were vain. The people declared themselves\r\nunpitying to tyrants, and resolved to do away with despotism in their\r\nquarter of the land, in like manner with their brethren in Paris. Five\r\nminutes for preparation was all they would allow, and even Charles at\r\nlength despaired of further favour. He approached the victim with a calm\r\nand serious countenance. The old man looked up.\r\n\r\n“Is there no hope?”\r\n\r\n“There is always hope. Let us hope that in another state we shall better\r\nknow how to love and forgive one another. Here, we have a poor\r\nunderstanding of this; but even here we can forgive. They will not now\r\nforgive you; but you will leave them that which will make them do so\r\nhereafter. Leave them your pardon.”\r\n\r\n“O, Alice,—my daughter! Not if they murder Alice.”\r\n\r\n“They shall not. I promise you——”\r\n\r\n“But I did not expect this,” uttered the shivering prisoner. “I went to\r\nbed——”\r\n\r\n“Then collect yourself now. A few minutes’ resolution.—One effort at\r\ncalmness——”\r\n\r\n“But is there no hope?”\r\n\r\n“None whatever. Settle your mind to your fate. There is only misery in\r\nstruggling against it.”\r\n\r\n“I will. I will. Only stay by me.”\r\n\r\n“What a confidence for such a moment!” thought Charles, as he saw the\r\ntractable expression which the countenance assumed. It was some comfort,\r\nhowever, that there was any confidence which could give decency to his\r\ndying deportment.\r\n\r\nThe people around grew impatient. The executioner lifted his sword. The\r\nvictim looked up at it, half fearfully, half meekly, like a penitent\r\nchild at the impending rod. He fell, without a sign or a cry; and at the\r\nmoment, the flames burst forth from the lower windows, as if to lick up,\r\nin as summary a vengeance as they had been guilty of, the perpetrators\r\nof this murder. All rushed from the terrace, with a yell of\r\nconsternation, leaving the body alone, its unclosed eyes shining in the\r\nglare, as if gazing unmoved on that violence which could no longer reach\r\nit in the shape of injury.—When the gust fell, and the flames retired\r\nsome space, the ruffian who held the sword returned to the place of\r\nexecution, severed the head, tossed the body into the flames, and\r\nreturned with his trophy to the cheering mob.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for Charles and Antoine to stay for. They could\r\nneither save property, nor prevent crime. There was no purpose to be\r\nanswered by an attempt to do the first; for the lady Alice could never\r\nreturn hither, or probably find any corner of her native land in which\r\nto dwell in peace. Any endeavour to check the people’s rage would only\r\nhave brought on more murders. It was better that they should occupy\r\nthemselves with destroying inanimate things than have their wrath\r\ndirected upon human objects. The brothers therefore left them\r\nendeavouring to discover the treasure-chamber, and paced silently\r\nhomewards, trying whether, after such a spectacle as this, their\r\nhopefulness could get the better of their heart-sickness.\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                              ADJUSTMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarguerite began to think that she and her family had better have staid\r\nin Paris, since violence as foul as any there, with less chance of\r\nredress, took place in the country. But as there were fewer marked for\r\ndestruction in a thinly peopled than in a crowded district, the work of\r\nhorror was sooner over; and within a few weeks, all was quiet around her\r\ndwelling. No judicial inquiry whatever was made into the fate of the\r\nmarquis; and night after night, ominous gleams were seen from afar,\r\nmarking where life and property were being offered up in expiation of\r\nformer tyranny. When every neighbouring chateau that was empty had been\r\nsealed up and guarded by the people from being entered by its owners;\r\nand when every inhabited one had been dismantled or converted into a\r\npile of blackened ruins, there was a truce. The gentry sighed over the\r\nabolition of feudalism; the peasantry gloried in the destruction of the\r\naristocracy; and both, looking no farther than their own borders,\r\nsupposed that all was over, and the state of the country,—miserable as\r\nit was,—settled.\r\n\r\nCharles and his brother knew too well what was passing in Paris to\r\nacquiesce in this belief; but they were glad of the good effects it\r\nseemed to produce in quieting the minds, and therefore fixing the\r\noutward circumstances of their neighbours. People went about their\r\nregular business once more, prices grew steady in the markets, and the\r\nmysterious, dishonest sort of bargaining which had gone on immediately\r\nafter the destruction of the chateaux, was seen no more. No golden\r\ntimepieces now passed from hand to hand, in exchange for the coarsest\r\narticles of clothing or furniture; and if polished tables, or morsels of\r\ncurious old china were seen here and there in the hovels of half-starved\r\npeasants, they were not put up for sale, and did not answer the purpose\r\nof further perplexing the values of things. Seeing that Marguerite began\r\nto feel pretty much at her ease once more, going to rest without\r\npresentiments of being roused by fire, and venturing, with only the\r\nchildren, to transact her necessary purchases among the peasantry,\r\nCharles began to try whether he could make anything of his business at\r\nParis; and set out, in order that he might be on the spot to take\r\nadvantage of the first symptoms of tranquillity to meet the demand which\r\nwould then certainly arise.\r\n\r\nHe went to Paris before winter was quite over; and found more promise of\r\na settlement of public affairs than at any time since the commencement\r\nof the revolution. Yet he would not hear of his family joining him, till\r\nit should be known whether or not king, parliament, and people would\r\ncordially agree in the new constitution which was then in preparation.\r\nWhen there was not only a promise of this, but all arts and artificers\r\nwere actually put in requisition to render the spectacle of taking the\r\noath as magnificent as the occasion required, there was no further\r\npretence for Charles’s prudence to interfere with the hopefulness which\r\nnow seemed rational enough. He sent a summons to Marguerite to return\r\nand witness the festival from which her loyalty and his patriotism might\r\nderive equal gratification. But Marguerite was detained in the country\r\nby her father’s illness,—his last; and the children were deprived of the\r\npower of saying afterwards that they had witnessed in Paris the\r\ntransactions of that day which was regarded at the time as the most\r\nremarkable in the annals of France.\r\n\r\nThat day, the 14th of July, 1790, was appointed to be a high festival\r\nthroughout the kingdom: Charles passed it in the Champ de Mars;\r\nMarguerite by the dying bed of her father; the children, under the\r\nguardianship of their uncle Antoine, among the rejoicing peasantry; and\r\nSteele, who had returned to Bordeaux when Charles settled himself again\r\nin Paris, took the opportunity of visiting La Haute Favorite for the\r\nfirst time after so many vicissitudes.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to them all a strange,—to the superstitious among them, an\r\nominous circumstance that they should be thus separated on the occasion\r\nwhen all were called upon to recognize the social agreement under which\r\nthey and their successors were to live.\r\n\r\nA gleam of the afternoon sun shone in upon the face of Marguerite’s\r\nfather as he dozed, and made him turn restlessly on his couch. His\r\ndaughter hastened to shut it out, and the movement awoke him.\r\n\r\n“One is fit only for the grave,” he said, “when the light which shines\r\non all above it becomes painful.”\r\n\r\n“Father! you are better,” said Marguerite, turning round astonished.\r\n\r\n“No,” said he, faintly, “not better. I cannot bear this light,—or this\r\nheat,—or—but no matter; it will presently be over. But where is\r\nCharles?”\r\n\r\n“He will be here very soon; but it is only two days since you became\r\nworse; and there has been no time for him to come yet. To-day he is\r\nwaiting upon the king, and next he will wait on you.”\r\n\r\n“On the king!” and the old man was roused at once. “And all the people?\r\nI fancied they had left off their duty. Who waits upon the king?”\r\n\r\n“The whole nation,” Marguerite replied, sighing to herself, however,\r\nover her own view of the matter—that the king was, in fact, waiting upon\r\nthe nation. She proceeded to tell what was doing in Paris, and remarked\r\nthat she hoped they had finer weather there than here, where it had been\r\na day of continued rain, till the gleam came which had wakened her\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nM. Raucourt was too ignorant of the events of the last two years to be\r\nable to comprehend the present proceeding. He could not see what the\r\npeople had to do with the constitution; but laid the blame on his own\r\nweak brain, when assured that the loyal men of France were all\r\nconsenting to the measure. Other tokens of ignorance were much more\r\naffecting to his daughter. He wished to be raised in bed, so that he\r\nmight see his olive woods in the evening glow. They were no longer\r\nthere, and his attention must be diverted to something else. He wished\r\nto behold the marquis de Thou passing the house for his daily ride.—The\r\nbones of him he asked for were mouldering under the ruins of his own\r\nabode.—“At least,” said M. Raucourt, “let me be carried to the window,\r\nthat I may see the chateau. It looks so finely on the terrace! and it is\r\nso long since I saw it!”—Grass was growing on its hearths, and the\r\npeasants’ children were playing hide and seek among its roofless halls.\r\n\r\n“You have not asked for the children,” said Marguerite. “If you are so\r\nstrong this afternoon, perhaps you can bear to speak to them.” And they\r\nwere sent for, and presently made their appearance from the river-side,\r\nfull of what they had been seeing and doing. They told how one cannon\r\nwas fired when the hour struck at which the royal procession was to set\r\nout, and another when the whole array was to be formed in the Champ de\r\nMars, and others to represent the taking of the oath by the king, by the\r\nrepresentatives of the parliament, and by Lafayette in the name of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n“And what is all this for?” asked the old man. “It is a beautiful\r\nspectacle, no doubt; but there were no such things in my time as the\r\nking and the people swearing at the same altar.”\r\n\r\n“The people make the king swear, and some of them do not think he likes\r\nit,”—observed Julien, unmindful of his mother’s signs. Pauline went on,\r\n\r\n“No more than he liked being brought prisoner from Versailles, and\r\nhaving his guards’ heads cut off.”\r\n\r\nThe little girl was terrified at the effect of her words. She in vain\r\nattempted to make up for them by saying that the king and queen were\r\nvery well now; and that the people did not expect to be starved any\r\nmore, and that everybody was to be very happy after this day. The loyal\r\nold man said he should never be happy any more; and groaned and wept\r\nhimself into a state of exhaustion from which he did not revive, though\r\nhe lived two or three days longer.\r\n\r\n“I wish,—I wish—” sobbed poor Pauline, “that the people had never\r\nmeddled with the king——”\r\n\r\n“Or the king with the people,” said Julien, “for that was the beginning\r\nof it all.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure so do I,” said Marguerite, sighing. “It is little comfort to\r\nsay, as Antoine does, that the world cannot roll on without crushing\r\nsomebody.”\r\n\r\n“If that somebody puts himself in the way, uncle said,” observed Julien.\r\n\r\n“Everybody has been in the way, I think, my dear. All France is\r\ncrushed.”\r\n\r\n“Not quite, mamma. Uncle Antoine and Mr. Steele are sitting between the\r\ntwo big vines, and they say that everybody will be buying wine now that\r\nbuying and selling are going to begin again.”\r\n\r\nIt was very true that the young men were enjoying their favourite\r\nretreat to the utmost; gilding it with the sunshine of their\r\nexpectations, and making it as musical with the voice of hope as with\r\nthe gay songs which were wafted from the revellers below.\r\n\r\nThey were not a little pleased when their anticipations were\r\ncountenanced by a letter from Charles which reached his wife on the day\r\nof her father’s death, and was not the less in accordance with her\r\nfeelings for having been written before tidings of the old man’s illness\r\nhad reached Paris, and being, as usual, hopeful and happy.\r\n\r\n“I have written to Antoine,” he said, “to urge all care in the\r\napproaching vintage, and all dispatch in the management of our immediate\r\nbusiness. Good days are coming at last, unless despotism should bring on\r\nitself a new punishment, and rouse once more the spirit of faction,\r\nwhich has been laid to rest this day by that powerful spell, the voice\r\nof a united nation. It would astonish you to see how commercial\r\nconfidence has already revived; and, as a consequence, how the values of\r\nall things are becoming fixed; and, again, as a consequence of this, how\r\nthe intercourses of society are facilitated, and its peace promoted. It\r\nwas the perception and anticipation of this which to me constituted the\r\nchief pleasure of the magnificent solemnity of this day. It was a grand\r\nthing to behold the national altar in the midst of an amphitheatre\r\nfilled with countless thousands; but it was a grander to remember that\r\nthese thousands were only the representatives of multitudes more who\r\nwere on tiptoe on all our hills, in all our valleys, watching and\r\nlistening for the token that they may trust one another once more, and\r\nexchange, for their mutual good, the fruits of their toil. It was\r\ntouching to see the battalion of children,—‘the hope of the\r\nnation,’—coming forward to remind the state that it sways the fate of a\r\nfuture age; but it was more touching to think of our own little ones,\r\nand to believe that, by the present act, the reward of the social\r\nvirtues we try to teach them is secured to them.—It was imposing to see\r\none golden flood of light gush from a parting cloud, giving an aspect of\r\nblessing to what had before been stormy; but it was as an analogy that\r\nit struck us all, and impelled us to send up a shout like the homage of\r\nworshippers of the sun. Has not a light broken through the dreariness of\r\nour political tempests? There maybe,—let us hope there will be, from\r\nthis day, order in the elements of our social state. Let but all\r\npreserve the faith they have sworn, and there will be no more sporting\r\nwith life and property, no absurd playing with baubles while there is a\r\ncraving for bread, no ruin to the industrious, and sudden wealth to such\r\nas speculate on national distress. We may once more estimate the labour\r\nof our peasantry, and the value of our own resources, and fix and\r\nreceive the due reward of each. We may reach that high point of national\r\nprosperity in which the ascertainment and due recompense of industry\r\ninvolve each other; when the values of things become calculable, and\r\nmutual confidence has a solid basis.—I do not say that this prosperity\r\nwill come, but I hope it will; and if all others have the same hope, it\r\ncertainly will. It may be that the sovereign will lose his confidence,\r\nand go back. It may be that the parliament or the people will do the\r\nsame; and then may follow worse miseries than we have yet known. But if\r\nthey see how much social confidence has to do with social prosperity,\r\nthey will refuse to disturb the tranquillity which has been this day\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n“And now, however you may sigh or smile a the spirit of hope which is in\r\nme and Antoine, what say you to it in the case of a nation? Are not its\r\ncommercial exchanges a most important branch of its intercourses? Must\r\nnot those exchanges be regulated by some principle of value, instead of\r\nbeing the sport of caprice? Is not that principle the due and equable\r\nrecompense of labour, or (in business-like terms) the cost of\r\nproduction? Is not this recompense secured by the natural workings of\r\ninterests—and can these interests work naturally without an anticipation\r\nof recompense—that is, without hope, inspiring confidence? Depend upon\r\nit, hope is not only the indispensable stimulus of individual action,\r\nbut the elastic pressure by which society is surrounded and held\r\ntogether. Great is the crime of those who injure it; and especially\r\nheinous will be the first trespass on public confidence of any who have\r\nbeen in the Champ de Mars this day. As that which is national springs\r\nfrom that which is individual, I will add that Antoine and Steele are\r\npatriotic if they exult in the ripening beauties of Favorite; and if you\r\nwould be patriotic too, gladden yourself with the promise of our\r\nchildren, and tell me, when we meet, that you trust with me that all\r\nwill be well both with our wines and our politics.”\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          _Summary of Principles illustrated in this Volume._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of Value: value in use, and value in exchange.\r\n\r\nArticles of the greatest value in use may have none in exchange; as they\r\nmay be enjoyed without labour; and it is labour which confers\r\nExchangeable Value.\r\n\r\nThis is not the less true for capital as well as labour being employed\r\nin production; for capital is hoarded labour.\r\n\r\nWhen equal quantities of any two articles require an equal amount of\r\nlabour to produce them, they exchange exactly against one another. If\r\none requires more labour than the other, a smaller quantity of the one\r\nexchanges against a larger quantity of the other.\r\n\r\nIf it were otherwise, no one would bestow a larger quantity of labour\r\nfor a less return; and the article requiring the most labour would cease\r\nto be produced.\r\n\r\nExchangeable value, therefore, naturally depends on cost of production.\r\n\r\nNaturally, but not universally; for there are influences which cause\r\ntemporary variations in exchangeable value.\r\n\r\nThese are, whatever circumstances affect demand and supply.\r\n\r\nBut these can act only temporarily; because the demand of any procurable\r\narticle creates supply; and the factitious value conferred by scarcity\r\nsoon has an end.\r\n\r\nWhen this end has arrived, cost of production again determines\r\nexchangeable value.\r\n\r\nIts doing so may, therefore, stand as a general rule.\r\n\r\nThough labour, immediate and hoarded, is the _regulator_, it is not the\r\n_measure_ of exchangeable value: for the sufficient reason, that labour\r\nitself is perpetually varying in quality and quantity, from there being\r\nno fixed proportion between immediate and hoarded labour.\r\n\r\nSince labour, the primary regulator, cannot serve as a measure of\r\nexchangeable value, none of the products of labour can serve as such a\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, no measure of exchangeable value.\r\n\r\nSuch a measure is not needed; as a due regulation of the supply of\r\nlabour, and the allowance of free scope to the principle of competition\r\nensure sufficient stability of exchangeable value for all practical\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nIn these requisites are included security of property, and freedom of\r\nexchange, to which political tranquillity and legislative impartiality\r\nare essential.\r\n\r\nPrice is the exponent of exchangeable value.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                           Transcriber’s Note\r\n\r\nWords hyphenated on line or page breaks have the hyphen removed if the\r\npreponderance of other occurences are unhyphenated.
