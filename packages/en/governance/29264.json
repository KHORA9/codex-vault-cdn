As I could not help him, as\r\ngladly I would have done, being poor, he sold it to a curb-stone\r\nbroker, a street note-shaver. I need not say that the poor soldier\r\nsustained a loss of twenty-five per cent. by the operation! He\r\nwanted to send the money home to his poor wife and children; yet one\r\nfourth of it was thus given into the hands of a stay-at-home\r\nspeculator. Alas, for me! I could not save the poor fellow from the\r\nremorseless shaver, but I could and did join him in a very energetic\r\ncursing of Chase, that at once pompous and passive patriot.\r\n\r\nThis induced me to enter upon a further and more particular\r\ninvestigation, and I found that hundreds of similar cases were of\r\nalmost daily occurrence; and that this cheating of the soldiers out\r\nof their nobly and patriotically earned pay, may quite fairly be\r\ndenounced as rather the rule than as the exception. The army is\r\nunpaid! Unspeakable infamy! Before,--long before the intellectually\r\npoor occupant of the White House, long before _any_ civil employé,\r\nbig or little, the ARMY ought to be paid. Common humanity, common\r\nsense, and sound policy affirm this; and common decency, to say\r\nnothing about chivalric feelings, adds that when paymasters are sent\r\nto the army at all, their first payments should be made to the rank\r\nand file; the generals and their subordinate officers to be paid,\r\nnot before, but afterwards. Oh! for the Congress, for the Congress\r\nto meet once again! My hope is in the Congress, to resist, and\r\nsternly put an end to, such heaven-defying and man-torturing\r\ninjustice as now braves the curses of outraged men, and the anger of\r\nGod. How this pompous Chase disappoints every one, even those who at\r\nfirst were inclined to be even weakly credulous and hopeful of his\r\nofficial career. And why is Stanton silent? He ought to roar. As for\r\nLincoln--he, ah! * * * * The curses of all the books of all the\r\nprophets be upon the culprits who have thus compelled our gallant\r\nand patriotic soldiery to mingle their tears with their own blood\r\nand the blood of the enemy!\r\n\r\n_Nov. 18._--Again Seward assures Lord Lyons that the national\r\ntroubles will soon be over, and that the general affairs of the\r\ncountry \"stand where he wanted them.\" Seward's crew circulate in the\r\nmost positive terms, that the country will be pacified by the State\r\nDepartment! England, moved by the State papers and official\r\nnotes--England, officially and non-officially, will stop the\r\niron-clads, built and launched in English ports and harbors for the\r\nuse of the rebels, and for the annoyance and injury of the United\r\nStates. England, these Americans say, England, no doubt, has said\r\nsome hard words, and has been guilty of some detestably treacherous\r\nactions; but all will probably be settled by the benign influence of\r\nMr. Seward's despatches, which, as everyone knows, are perfectly\r\nirresistible. How the wily Palmerston must chuckle in Downing\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nThe difference between Seward and a real statesman, is this: that a\r\nstatesman is always, and very wisely, chary about committing himself\r\nin writing, and only does it when compelled by absolutely\r\nirresistible circumstances, or by temptations brilliant enough to\r\noverrule all other considerations; for, such a statesman never for\r\none moment forgets or disregards the old adage which saith that\r\n\"_Verba volant, scripta manent_.\" But Seward, on the contrary,\r\nliterally revels in a flood of ink, and fancies that the more he\r\nwrites, the greater statesman he becomes.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this month, I wrote to the French minister, M.\r\nMercier, a friendly and respectful note, warning him against\r\nmeddling with politicians and busybodies. I told him that, before he\r\ncould even suspect it, such men would bring his name before the\r\npublic in a way neither pleasant nor profitable to him. M. Mercier\r\ntook it in good part, and cordially thanked me for my advice.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 19._--Burnside means well, and has a good heart; but something\r\nmore is required to make a capable captain, more especially in such\r\ntimes as those in which we are living. It is said that his staff is\r\nwell organized; God be praised for that, if it really is so. In that\r\ncase, Burnside will be the first among the loudly-lauded and\r\nself-conceited West-Point men, forcibly to impress both the military\r\nand the civilian mind in America, with a wholesome consciousness of\r\nthe paramount importance to an army of a thoroughly competent and\r\ntrustworthy staff.\r\n\r\nThe division of the army into three grand corps is good; it is at\r\nonce wise and well-timed, following the example set by Napoleon,\r\nwhen he invaded Russia in 1812. If his subordinate generals will but\r\ndo well, I have entire confidence in Hooker. He is the man for the\r\ntime and for the place. As a fighting man, Sumner is fully and\r\nunquestionably reliable; but I have my doubts about Franklin. He is\r\ncold, calculating, and ambitious, and he has the especially bad\r\nquality of being addicted to the alternate blowing of hot and cold.\r\nBurnside did a good thing in confiding to General Siegel a separate\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nThe _New York Times_ begins to mend its bad ways; but how long will\r\nit continue in the better path?\r\n\r\n_Nov. 20._--England stirs up and backs up rebellion and disunion\r\nhere; but, in Europe, for the sake of the unity of barbarism,\r\nIslamism, and Turkey, England throttles, and manacles, and lays\r\nprostrate beneath the feet of the Osmanli, the Greeks, the Sclavi,\r\nthe heroic Montenegrins. England is the very incarnation of a\r\ntreachery and a perfidy previously unexampled in the history of the\r\nworld. The _Punica fides_, so fiercely denounced and so bitterly\r\nsatirized by the historians and poets of old Rome, was truthful if\r\ncompared to the _Fides Anglica_ of our own day.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 22._--Our army seems to be massed so as to be able to wedge\r\nitself in between Jackson in the valley and Lee at Gordonsville. By\r\na bold manoeuvre, each of them could be separately attacked, and, I\r\nfirmly believe, destroyed. But, unfortunately, boldness and\r\nmanoeuvre, that highest gift, that supreme inspiration of the\r\nconsummate captain, have no abiding place in the bemuddled brains of\r\nthe West-Pointers, who are a dead weight and drag-chain upon the\r\nvictimised and humiliated Army of the Potomac.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 25._--The Army is stuck fast in the mud, and the march towards\r\nFredericksburgh is not at all unlikely to end in smoke. There seems\r\nto be an utter absence of executive energy. Why not mask our\r\nmovements before Gordonsville from the observation of Lee? Or, if\r\npreferable, what is to hinder the interposition of _un rideau\r\nvivant_, a _living curtain_, in the form of a false attack, a feint\r\nin considerable force, behind which the whole army might be securely\r\nthrown across the Rappahannock, by which at least two days' march\r\nwould be gained on Lee, and our troops would be on the direct line\r\nfor Fredericksburg, if Fredericksburg is really to be the base for\r\nfuture operations. In this way, the army would have marched against\r\nFredericksburg on both sides of the river. Or, supposing those plans\r\nto be rejected, why not throw a whole army corps at once, say 40,000\r\nto 50,000 strong, across the Rappahannock. On either plan, I repeat\r\nit, at least two days' march would have been stolen upon Lee; three\r\nor four days of forced marches would have been healthy for our army,\r\nand a bloodless victory would have been obtained by the taking of\r\nthe seemingly undefended Fredericksburg. A dense cloud enveloped\r\nthis whole enterprise, and it is not even improbable, that the\r\ncampaign may become a dead failure even before it has accomplished\r\nthe half of its projected and loudly vaunted course. But bold\r\nconceptions, and energetic movements to match them, are just about\r\nas possible to Halleck or Burnside as railroad speed to the tedious\r\ntortoise.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 25._--Oh! So Louis Napoleon could not keep quiet. He offers\r\nhis mediation, which, in plain English, means his moral support to\r\nthe South. Oh! that enemy to the whole human race. That\r\n_Decembriseur_.[1] Our military slowness, if nothing else is the\r\nmatter, our administrative and governmental helplessness, and\r\nSeward's lying and all-confusing foreign policy have encouraged\r\nforeign impertinence and foreign meddling. I have all along\r\nanticipated them as an at least very possible result of the above\r\nmentioned causes. [See vol. I of the Diary.] Nevertheless, I\r\nscarcely expected such results to appear so soon. Perhaps this same\r\nimpertinent French action may prove a second French _faux pas_, to\r\nfollow in the wake of the first and very egregious _faux pas_ in\r\nMexico. The best that we can say for the _Decembriseur_ is, that he\r\nis getting old. England refuses to join in his at once wild and\r\natrocious schemes, and makes a very Tomfool of the bloody Fox of the\r\nTuileries. My, Russia--ah! I am very confident of that--will refuse\r\nto join in the dirty and treacherous conspiracy for the\r\npreservation of slavery. Well for mediation. But Mr. _Decembriseur_,\r\nwhat think you and your diplomatic lackeys; what judgment and what\r\ndetermination do you and they form as to the terms and the\r\ntermination, too, of your diabolical scheme? Descend, sir, from your\r\nshilly-shally generalities and verbal fallacies. Is it to be a\r\ncommercial union, this hobby of your minister here? What is it; let\r\nus in all plainness of speech know what it is that you really and\r\npositively intend. Propound to us the plain meaning and scope of\r\nyour imperial proposition.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 1: The men who, in the great French revolution,\r\n         and under the leadership of Danton and of the municipality\r\n         of Paris, massacred the political prisoners in September,\r\n         1792, are recorded in history under the name of\r\n         _Septembriseurs_. Louis Napoleon may no less justly be\r\n         called the _Decembriseur_, from that frightful massacre on\r\n         the 2nd of December, from which he dates his despotism.]\r\n\r\n_Nov. 27._--Lee, with his army, marches or marched on the south side\r\nof the river, in a parallel to the line of Burnside on the north\r\nside of the river, and Jackson quietly, but quickly follows. They\r\nare at Fredericksburg, and our army looms up, calm, but stern;\r\nstill, but defiant and menacing. I heartily wish that Burnside may\r\nbe successful, and that I may prove to have been a false prophet.\r\nBut the great _Fatum_, FATE, seems to declare against Burnside, and\r\nFate generally takes sides with bold conceptions and their energetic\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 28._--The French despatch-scheme reads very like a Washington\r\nconcoction, and does not at all bear the marks of Parisian origin. I\r\nfind in it whole phrases which, for months past, I have repeatedly\r\nheard from the French minister here. Perhaps Mr. Mercier, in his\r\nturn, may have caught many of Mr. Seward's much-cherished\r\ngeneralities, unintelligible, very probably, even to himself, and\r\nquite certainly so to every one but himself. Perhaps, I say, Mr.\r\nMercier may have caught up some of them, and making them up at\r\nhap-hazard into a _macedoine_, a hash, a hotch-potch, has served up\r\nthe second-hand and heterogeneous mess to his master in Paris. The\r\ndespatch expresses the fear of a servile war; this may very well\r\nhave been copied from Mr. Seward's despatch to Mr. Adams, (May,\r\n1862,) wherein Seward attempted to frighten England by a prophecy of\r\na servile war in this country.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 30._--Mr. Seward semi-officially and conveniently accepts the\r\nFrench impudence. Computing the time and space, the scheme\r\ncorresponds with McClellan's inactivity after Antietam, and with the\r\nraising of the banner of the Copperheads. I spoke of this before,\r\n(see Diary for November and December, 1861, in Vol. I.) and\r\nrepeatedly warned Stanton.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 30._--Mercier, the French diplomat, rapidly gravitates towards\r\nthe Copperheads--Democrats. Is he acting thus _in obedience to\r\norders_? After all, some of the diplomats here, and especially those\r\nof what call themselves the \"three great powers,\" almost openly\r\nsympathize and side with secessionists, and patronize Copperheads,\r\ntraitors, and spies. The exceptions to this rule are but few;\r\nstrictly speaking, indeed, I should except only one young man. Some\r\ndiplomats justify this conduct on the plea that the Republican\r\nCongressmen are \"great bores,\" who will not play at cards, or dine\r\nand drink copiously; accomplishments in which the Secesh was so\r\npre-eminent as to win his way to the inner depths of the diplomatic\r\nheart. The people, I am sure, will heartily applaud those of its\r\nrepresentatives for thus incurring the contempt of dissipated\r\ndiplomats.\r\n\r\nSome persons maintain that Stanton breaks down, perhaps that he\r\nsuffers, physically as well as mentally, from his necessitated\r\ncontact with his official colleagues and his and their persistent,\r\ninevitable and inexorable hangers-on and supplicants. I do not\r\nperceive the alleged failure of his health or powers, and I do not\r\nbelieve it; but assuredly, it were no marvel if such really were the\r\ncase. It must be an adamantine constitution and temper that could\r\nlong bear with impunity the daily contact with a Lincoln, a Seward,\r\na Halleck, and others less noted, indeed, but not the less\r\ncontagious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER, 1862\r\n\r\n     President's Message -- Political position -- Fredericksburgh --\r\n     Fog -- Accident -- Crisis in the Cabinet -- Secretary Chase --\r\n     Burnside -- Halleck -- the Butchers -- The Lickspittle Republican\r\n     Press -- War Committee patriots -- Youth -- People -- Ring out.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrammarians may criticize the syntax of the President's message, and\r\nthe style. It reads uneasy, forced, tortuous, and it declares that\r\nit is _impossible_ to subdue the rebels by force of arms. Of course\r\nit is impossible with Lincoln for President, and first McClellan\r\nand then Halleck to counterfeit the parts of the first Napoleon, and\r\nthe at once energetic and scientific Carnot. Were the great heart of\r\nTHE PEOPLE left to itself, it would be very _possible_ and even\r\nquite easily _possible_.\r\n\r\nThe message is written with an eye turned towards the Democrats;\r\nthey are to be satisfied with the prospect of a convention. Seward\r\nputs lies into Lincoln's pen, in relation to foreign nations. But\r\nall is well, in the judgment of our _Great Statesmen_. Even the poor\r\nlogic is, according to them, quite admirable.\r\n\r\nContrariwise, Stanton's report corresponds to the height and the\r\ngravity of events, and is worthy alike of the writer, and of the\r\npeople to whom it is addressed.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 6._--Nearly four weeks the campaign has been opened; the enemy\r\nadds fortifications to fortifications before the very eyes of our\r\narmy, yet nothing has been done towards preventing the rebels from\r\nworking upon the formidable strongholds.\r\n\r\nDoes Halleck-Burnside intend to wait until the rebels shall be\r\nthoroughly prepared to repel any attack that may be made upon them?\r\nEither there is foul play going on, or there is stupendous\r\nstupidity pervading the entire management. But no one sees it, or\r\nrather few, if any, wish to see it. Stanton, I am quite sure, has\r\nnothing to do with the special plans of this enterprise. All is\r\nplanned and ruled by Lincoln, Halleck and Burnside.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 7._--The political situation to-day, may be summarily stated\r\nas follows: the Republicans are confused by recent electoral\r\ndefeats, and by the administrative and governmental helplessness, as\r\nexhibited every day by their leaders; the Democrats, flushed with\r\nsuccess, display an unusual activity in evil doing, and are risking\r\neverything to preserve Slavery and the South from destruction. I\r\nspeak of the Simon-pure Democrats, _alias_ Copperheads, such as the\r\nWoods, the Seymours, the Vallandighams, the Coxes, the Biddles, &c.\r\nThe Sewards and the Weeds are ready for a compromise. The masses of\r\nthe people, staggered by all this bewildering turmoil and impure\r\nfactiousness, are nevertheless, stubbornly determined to persevere\r\nand to succeed in saving their country.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 7._--The European wiseacres, the would-be statesmen, whether\r\nin or out of power, especially in England, and that opprobrium of\r\nour century, the English and the Franco-Bonapartist press, have\r\ndecided to do all that their clever brains can scheme towards\r\npreventing this noble American people from working out its mighty\r\nand beneficent destinies, and from elaborating and making more\r\nglorious than ever its own already very glorious history. As well\r\nmight the brainless and heartless conspirators against human\r\nprogress and human liberty endeavor to arrest the rotation of a\r\nplanet by the stroke of a pickaxe.\r\n\r\nAh! Mr. _Decembriseur_, with your base crew of lickspittles, your\r\npigmy, though treacherous efforts, even contending with those of the\r\nEnglish enemies of light, and of right, your common hatred of\r\nFreedom and Freemen will end in being the destruction of yourself.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 7._--Burnside complains of the manner in which he is\r\nvictimised, and explains his inactivity by the fact that the War\r\nDepartment neglected to furnish him with the necessary pontoons.\r\nHow, in fact, was Burnside to move a great army without pontoons?\r\nBut it was the duty of Halleck, and his lazy or incompetent, or\r\ntraitorous staff, to have seen to the sending on of the pontoons.\r\nHowever, supposing Burnside and _his_ staff to have as much wit as\r\nan average twelve-year-old school boy, they could have found in the\r\narmy not merely hundreds, but even thousands of proficient workmen\r\nin a variety of mechanical trades, who would have constructed on the\r\nspot, and at the shortest notice, any number of bridges, pontoons,\r\n&c. Oh, how little are those wiseacre generals, the conceited and\r\nswaggering West Pointers; oh, how very little, if at all are they\r\naware of the inexhaustible ingenuity and resources, the marvelous\r\nskill and power of such intelligent masses as those of which they\r\nare the unintelligent, the unsympathising and the thoroughly\r\nunblessed leaders!\r\n\r\nOn a Sunday, exactly four weeks back from the day which I wrote\r\nthese lines, McClellan was dismissed, and was succeeded by Burnside.\r\nBut, after the established McClellan fashion, the great, great army\r\nwas marched 30 to 50 miles, and then halts for weeks up to its knees\r\nin mud, and occupies itself in throwing up earthworks. And this is\r\ncalled making War! and the Hallecks are great men in the sight of\r\nAbraham Lincoln, and of all who profess and call themselves\r\nLincolnites, and the rest stand around wondering and agape:\r\n\r\n  _Conticuere omnes intentique ora (asinina) tenebant._\r\n\r\nStanton's magnificent report states that there are about 700,000 men\r\nunder arms; yet this tremendous force is paralysed by the inactivity\r\nof most of the generals; those in the West, however, forming a\r\nbright and truly honorable exception. But, to be candid, how can\r\nactivity and dash be expected from generals who have at their head,\r\na shallow brained pedant like Halleck? Napoleon had about 500,000\r\nmen, when, in between four and five months, he marched from the\r\nRhine to Moscow. Yet he had the aid of no railroad, on land, no\r\nsteam, that practical annihilator of distance, no electric\r\ntelegraph, with which to be in all but instantaneous communication\r\nwith his distant generals, and had not similar material resources.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 10._--Mr. Seward's long correspondence with Mr. Adams shows to\r\nEurope that Mr. Seward imitated the rebels, and tried to frighten\r\nEngland with the bugbear of King Cotton; and also that he has no\r\nsolid and abiding convictions whatever. Now, he preaches\r\nemancipation, yet, at the beginning of his _great_ diplomatic\r\nactivity, he openly sided with slavery; aye, he is still willing to\r\nsave it for the sake of the Union, and, above all, and before all,\r\nfor his own chances for the next Presidency.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 10._--Burnside has finally crossed the Rappahannock. Of course\r\nI do not know the respective positions. But I am sure that if the\r\nrebels have not a perfectly enormous advantage of position, and if\r\nthe leading of the generals be worthy of the courage of their men,\r\nthe victory must be ours. Oh! were all our generals Hookers, and not\r\nBurnsides!\r\n\r\nGeneral McDowell's Court of Inquiry produces some strange revelations.\r\nThe inquiry will not end in making a thorough general of McDowell. He\r\nmay have been somewhat unfortunate, no doubt; but his want of good\r\nfortune was at least equalled by his want of good generalship. I, and\r\nmany others besides, were quite mistaken in our early estimate of\r\nMcDowell. He should not so easily have swallowed the second Bull Run.\r\nHe should at least have been wounded, if only ever so slightly; his\r\nbest friends must wish that. But to be defeated, and come out without\r\neven a scratch! What a digestion the man must have for the hardest\r\nkinds of humiliation! But neither the President nor that curse of the\r\ncountry, McClellan, has great reason to plume himself much upon his\r\nshare in the revelations that are made in the course of this Inquiry.\r\nMcDowell himself seems to have been intended, by nature for a scheming\r\nand adroit politician. * * * *\r\n\r\n_Dec. 10._--The Congress feels the ground, hesitates, and apparently\r\nlacks the necessary energy to come to a determination. Lincoln, even\r\nsuch as he is, contrives to humbug most of the Congressmen. Well!\r\nThe first of January is close at hand, and Seward, the Congressional\r\ncook, will concoct unpalatable and costly dishes for Congressional\r\ndigestion. Seward is the incarnation of confusion, and of political\r\nfaithlessness.\r\n\r\nI have only now discovered certain of the reasons why the Battle of\r\nAntietam, so bravely fought by our army, had no _ensemble_ and such\r\nmarvelously poor results. Burnside, with his corps, got into line\r\nmany hours too late. The rebels were thus enabled to concentrate on\r\nthe wing opposed to Hooker and Sumner, the right wing and centre of\r\nthe rebels being for the time unthreatened. And that is generalship!\r\nThe blame of a blunder so glaring, and in its effect so mischievous,\r\nattaches equally to Burnside and to McClellan. The victory, such as\r\nit was, was due to the subordinate generals, and to the heroic\r\nbravery of the rank and file of the army.\r\n\r\nWhen Burnside was invested with the command of the Army of the\r\nPotomac, he for nearly twenty-four hours retained McClellan in camp,\r\nwith the intention of returning the command of the army to him if\r\nthe rebels had attacked, as it was expected they would, during\r\nSunday and Monday.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 13._--Night. Fight at Fredericksburgh. No news. O God!\r\n\r\n_Dec. 14._--As the consequence of Halleck-Burnside's slowness, our\r\ntroops storm positions which are said to be impregnable by nature,\r\nand still farther strengthened by artificial works.\r\n\r\nThe President is even worse than I had imagined him to be. He has no\r\nearnestness, but is altogether in the hands of Seward and Halleck.\r\nHe cannot, even in this supreme crisis, be earnest and serious for\r\nhalf an hour. Such was the severe but terribly true verdict passed\r\nupon him by Fessenden of Maine.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 15._--Slaughter and infamy! Slaughter of our troops who fought\r\nlike Titans, though handled in a style to reflect nothing but infamy\r\nupon their commanders. When the rebel works had become impregnable,\r\nthen, but not until then, our troops were hurled against them! The\r\nflower of the army has thus been butchered by the surpassing stupidity\r\nof its commanders. The details of that slaughter, and of the\r\nimbecility displayed by our officers in high command,--those details,\r\nwhen published, will be horrible. The Lincoln-Seward-Halleck-influence\r\ngave Burnside the command because he was to take care of the army. And\r\nhow Burnside has fulfilled their expectations! It seems that the best\r\nway to take care of an army is to make it victorious.\r\n\r\nMy brave and patriotic Wadsworth has gone in the field, also his two\r\nsons; one of them, (Tick,) was at Fredericksburgh, and his bravery\r\nwas remarkable, even among all the heroism of that most glorious and\r\nmost accursed day. How many such patriots as Wadsworth, can we boast\r\nof? Yet the miserable Halleck had the impudence to say--\"Wadsworth\r\nmay go wherever he pleases, even if he pleases to go to Hell!\"\r\n\r\nHell itself, would be too good a place for Halleck; imbeciles are\r\nnot admitted there!\r\n\r\n_Dec. 17._--The details are coming in. The disaster of our army is\r\nterrible--indescribable; the heroic people bleeds, bleeds! And all\r\nthis calamity and all this suffering and humiliation, are brought on\r\nby the stupidity of Burnside and Halleck, or both of them. The curse\r\nof the people ought to rest for centuries upon the very names of the\r\nauthors of such frightful disaster. They are fiends, yea, worse,\r\neven, than the very fiends themselves.\r\n\r\nWhy, even the very rabble in Constantinople would storm the seraglio\r\nafter such a massacre. But here--oh, here, it just reminds Mr.\r\nLincoln of a little anecdote.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 17._--I meet with but few such as Wade, Grimes, Chandler and\r\nother radicals in both Houses of Congress, who seem to feel all the\r\nheart burning and bitterness of soul at this awful Fredericksburgh\r\ndisaster. The real criminals, those who ought, in the agonies of a\r\ngreat shame, call upon the rocks and the mountains to fall upon them\r\nnot, blush not, sorrow not.\r\n\r\nIn many of the general public, I have no doubt that the feeling of\r\nshame and sympathy, are blunted by these repeated military\r\ncalamities, and by Mr. Lincoln's undaunted i..........\r\n\r\n  * * * * * and men,\r\n  Have wept enough, for what? To weep,\r\n  To weep again.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 17._--About ten days ago, Mr. Seward again sent forth to\r\nEurope and to her Cabinets, one of his stale, and by no means\r\nDelphic oracles, predicting the success of Burnside's campaign, and\r\nimmediately follows a bloody and disgraceful calamity! Such is\r\nalways the result of Seward's prophecies! A diplomat calls Seward\r\nthe evil eye of the Cabinet, and of the country. I suggested to some\r\nof the senators that a resolution be passed prohibiting Mr. Seward\r\nfrom playing either the prophet or the fool.\r\n\r\nBurnside took care of the army, no doubt, but it was of the rebel\r\narmy. Our soldiers have been brought by him to the block, to an easy\r\nslaughter, he himself being some few miles in the rear, and having\r\nbetween him the river, and the intervening miles of land. All this,\r\nhowever, was according to the regulations, and on the most approved\r\nHalleck-McClellan fashion of fighting great battles.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 18._--The disaster was inaugurated by the shelling of\r\nFredericksburgh. One hundred and forty-seven (147!) guns playing\r\nupon a few houses. It was the play of a maddened child, exhibiting\r\nin equal proportions, reckless ferocity and egregious stupidity; and\r\nit is difficult to find one dyslogistic term which will adequately\r\ndescribe and condemn it.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can already gather of the details of the attack, it may\r\nbe peremptorily concluded that Burnside, Sumner, and above all,\r\nFranklin, are utterly incompetent of a skillful and effective\r\nhandling of great masses of troops. They attacked by brigades,\r\npositions so formidable, that if they could possibly be carried by\r\nany exertion of human skill and strength, they could only be carried\r\nby large masses impetuously hurled against them. Franklin seems\r\nespecially to have acted ill in not at once throwing in 10,000 men\r\nto be followed rapidly and again and again by 10,000 more. In that\r\nwise and only in that wise, he might possibly have broken and turned\r\nthe enemy, and thrown him on his own centre. It is said that\r\nFranklin had 60,000. If so, he could easily have risked some 20,000\r\nin the first onslaught. Sixty thousand! Great God! Why, it is an\r\narmy in itself, in the hands of a general at all deserving of that\r\nname. If those great West Pointers had only even the slightest idea\r\nof military history! More battles have been fought and won with\r\n60,000 men, and with fewer still, than with larger numbers, and at\r\nFredericksburgh Franklin's force formed only a wing against an enemy\r\nwhose whole army could number but little more than 60,000. I want\r\nthe reports with the full and positive details.\r\n\r\nThe clear-sighted and warlike TRIBUNE discovered in Burnside high,\r\nbrilliant, and soldier-like qualities--admirably borne out and\r\nillustrated no doubt, by the Fredericksburgh butchery! To the\r\nhospital of imbeciles with all such imbeciles!\r\n\r\nThe _Times_ was manly in its appreciation, and flunkeyed to no one\r\nunder hand, that is, confidentially and for newspaper publication.\r\n\r\nMr. Seward reveals to the world at large, that, besides his volume\r\nof 700 pages, containing the last diplomatic correspondence, he has\r\nstill an equal number of masterpieces as yet not published. What a\r\ndreadful dysentery of despatch-writing the poor man and his still\r\nmore afflicted readers must labor under.\r\n\r\nThe Lincoln-Seward policy, has rebuilt the awful Democratic party,\r\nwhich was broken up, prostrated in the dust. Lincoln--Seward--Weed,\r\npartially emasculated the Republican party, and may even emasculate\r\nthe thus far thoroughly virile and devoted patriotism of the people.\r\n\r\nA helpless imbecile in the hands of a cunning and selfish and\r\nruthless charlatan, is the sight that daily meets our eyes in\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nGeneral Bayard, one of the slaughtered at Fredericksburgh, was a\r\ntrue Bayard of the army, and one of the very few West Pointers free\r\nfrom conceit, that corrosive and terribly prevalent malady of the\r\nWest Point clique.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 18._--Senators waking up to their duties, and to the\r\nconsciousness of their power. These patriots have said to Seward,\r\n_Averte Sathanas_, and overboard he goes, after having done as much\r\nevil as only _he_ could do.\r\n\r\nThe most contradictory rumors are in circulation about Stanton. I\r\ncannot find out the truth. I do not believe all that is said, but it\r\nis necessary to put the rumors on record. It is said then, that\r\nStanton stands up for the butchers and asses in the army and in his\r\ndepartment. I believe that in all this, there is not a single word\r\nof truth; but if it were true, then I should say, Stanton is ruined\r\nby bad company, and down with him and with them!\r\n\r\n_Quoniam sic Fata tulerunt._ But worthy Senators and\r\nRepresentatives, believe still in Stanton, and so do I; only the\r\nSeward-Blair-McClellan clique tears Stanton's reputation to pieces.\r\nStanton seems to be, in some measure, infatuated with Halleck, who,\r\nperhaps, humbugs Stanton with military technicalities, which Halleck\r\nso well knows how to pass current for military science.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 20._--The American generals, at least those in the Army of the\r\nPotomac, for the sake of shirking responsibility, maintain that\r\nwhen once in line of battle, they must rigidly abide by the orders\r\ngiven to them. No doubt, such is the military law and rule, but it\r\nis susceptible of exceptions. The generals of the Potomac shun the\r\nexceptions, and thus deprive their action of all spontaneity.\r\nPerhaps, indeed, spontaneity of action is not among their military\r\ngifts. Thus we have from them, none of those _coups d'éclat_, those\r\nsudden, brilliant, and impetuously improvised dashes, which so often\r\ndecide the fate of the day, and turn imminent defeat and partial\r\npanic into glorious and crowning victory. We find none such, if we\r\nexcept some actions of Hooker and Kearney, on a small scale, and at\r\nthe beginning of the campaign in the Chickahominy, or the Peninsula.\r\nThe most celebrated _coups d'éclat_ in general military history,\r\nhave mostly been, so to speak, the children of inspiration, seizing\r\nTime by the forelock,--thus using opportunity which sometimes exists\r\nbut for a few minutes, and thus a doubtful struggle terminates in a\r\nbrilliant success. At such critical moments, the commander of a\r\nwing, or a corps, nay, even a division, ought to have the courage,\r\nthe lofty self-abnegation, and firm confidence in his star or good\r\nluck, and still more in the enduring pluck of his men, and boldly\r\nstrike for the accomplishment of that which the \"Orders\" have not\r\nmentioned or foreseen. Such a general acts on his own inspiration,\r\nand at the same time reports to the Commander-in-Chief, what he has\r\ndetermined upon. If instead of acting thus promptly, he sends and\r\nwaits for further orders, the auspicious opportunity may pass away;\r\nthe decisive moments in a battle are very rapid, and a single hour\r\nlost, loses the day, or reduces the results of a victory.\r\n\r\nI respectfully submit these undeniable but much disregarded truths\r\nto the Hallecks, McClellans, McDowells, and other great West\r\nPointers.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 20._--The political cesspool is deeper, broader, filthier and\r\nmore feculent than ever. Seward is triumphant, and the patriots have\r\nvery much elongated countenances.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 21._--Senator Wilson has learned from Halleck, Burnside, and\r\nfrom some other and similarly _great_ captains, that the affair of\r\nFredericksburgh, and the recrossing of the river, brilliantly\r\ncompares with the countermarchings of Wagram, and with that\r\ncelebrated crossing of the Danube. As there is not, in reality, a\r\nsingle point of similitude, the comparison is well selected, and\r\ndoes great honor to the judgment of the military wiseacres. At all\r\nevents, never was the memory of a Napoleon, a Massena, or a Davoust,\r\nmore ignominiously desecrated than by this comparison.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 22._--So, then, Sathanas Seward remains, and Mr. Lincoln\r\nscorns the advice of the wisest and most patriotic Senators. To be\r\nsnubbed by Lincoln and Seward, is the greatest of all possible\r\nhumiliations. Border-state politicians, Harrises, Brownings and\r\nother etceteras of grain, are the confidential advisers. Political\r\nmanhood is utterly, and to all seeming, irretrievably lost.\r\n\r\nStanton still holds with Seward. _Embrassons nous, et que cela\r\nfinisse._\r\n\r\nHow brilliantly do even the very basest times of any government\r\nwhatever, Parliamentary, royal or despotic, compare with what I now\r\ndaily see here in the capital of the great republic!\r\n\r\nSince the earliest existence of political parties, rarely, if ever,\r\nhas a party been in such a difficult, and, at times, even disgraceful\r\nposition, as that of the patriots of both houses of Congress. Against\r\nthe combined attacks of all stripes of traitors, such as ultra\r\nConservatives, Constitutionalists, Copperheads and pure and impure\r\nDemocrats, the patriots must defend an administration which they\r\nthemselves condemn, and with the personnel of which, (Stanton and\r\nWells excepted,) they have no sympathy and no identity of ideas. They\r\nmust defend an administration which opposes even measures which they,\r\nthe patriots, demand,--an administration which, in the recent\r\nelections, either betrayed or disgraced the whole party, and which\r\nbrought into suspicion, if not into actual contempt, the name, nay,\r\neven the principles of the Republicans. And thus the patriots have the\r\ndead weight to support, and are wholly unsupported. The narrow-minded\r\nand shallow Republican press, has no comprehension of the difficulty\r\nof the position in which the patriots are placed; and that press,\r\nbeing in various ways connected with the administration, rarely, if\r\never, supports the patriots, and even mostly neutralises their best\r\nand noblest efforts. Thus, in the move against Seward, and for a\r\nreform in the Cabinet, the enlightened and patriotic Republican press\r\nof New York, was either persistently mute or hostile to the movement.\r\nEvery day I am the more firmly convinced that Seward is the great\r\nstumbling block alike to Mr. Lincoln and the country at large.\r\n\r\n_Dec, 22._--Utterly incapable as is McClellan, and absolutely\r\nunfitted by nature to be a great captain as is Burnside, yet I think\r\nit quite clear that neither of them would have blundered quite so\r\nterribly if he had been provided with a really competent, zealous\r\nand faithful staff, as the generals of continental Europe invariably\r\nare. But it seems that here, neither the generals nor the government\r\neven desire to understand the true nature, duty, and value of the\r\nstaff of an army, or what the chief of such a staff ought to know\r\nand ought to do. What, in fact, can we at all reasonably expect from\r\na Halleck! After all, however, and shallow as are his brains, this\r\nmock Carnot must have read books on military science; and yet he has\r\nnot learned either the use or the composition of a staff for an\r\narmy! Had he done so, he would have organized a staff for himself,\r\nand one for each of the commanders in the field. It is true that in\r\nthis country there is no school of staffs, and West Pointers are\r\ngenerally ignorant on that point. Nevertheless, with a little good\r\nwill and care, it would be easy enough to find intelligent officers\r\nof all grades fit for staff duties as arranged for staff officers in\r\nEurope. But then, the necessary good will and good judgment are\r\nwanting in the head of this military organization. And this Halleck,\r\nthis Halleck is a mere mockery, a mere sciolist, a shallow pretender\r\nto military science. He may have the capacity to translate a book,\r\nbut nothing of all that he translates effects any hold upon his\r\nbrain, or he would, long before now, have done something towards\r\norganising the army. A general inspector is the first necessity.\r\nThen establish the necessary proportions of each arm of the service,\r\n_i. e._, of infantry, cavalry and artillery for each division. Then\r\norganise the cavalry as a body. When you do this, or even a\r\nconsiderable part of all this, oh, sham-Carnot, Halleck! then your\r\nchance to be considered a military authority will be established.\r\nOh, science, oh, insulted science! How desecrated is thy name in the\r\nhigh places here, and especially on the right and left of the White\r\nHouse. And oh! you really great and intelligent American PEOPLE, how\r\nignominiously you are cheated of your blood, your time, your money,\r\nand most of all, of your so recently magnificent national\r\nreputation!\r\n\r\nWhat your military wiseacres show you as an organized army, would\r\nactually thrill, as with the death-shudder, any European military\r\norganizer.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 23._--I learn that the day following the butchery at\r\nFredericksburgh, Burnside wished to renew the attack. What madness!\r\nThe generals protested, and Burnside, greatly exasperated, declared\r\nthat at the head of his former corps, the 9th, he would himself\r\nstorm the miniature Torres Vedras. If all this is true, then\r\nBurnside is weaker headed than I had judged him to be; but I will\r\nnot do him the injustice to say that he really intended to play a\r\nmere farce. What, in the name of common sense, could he do with a\r\nsingle corps, when the whole army was repulsed?\r\n\r\nI am warned by a friend, that the Army of the Potomac is so infected\r\nwith McClellanism, that is to say, by presumption, intriguing, envy\r\nand misconception of what is true generalship,--that the army must\r\nundergo the process of strong purification, fumigation, pruning and\r\nweeding, (and especially among the higher branches,) before it can\r\never again be made truly useful and reliable.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 22._--Burnside's report. I am sure that the great luminaries\r\nof the press, and the declaimers, the intriguants and the imbeciles,\r\nwill be thrown into fits of ecstatic admiration of what they will\r\ncall the manly and straight-forward conduct of Burnside in assuming\r\nthe responsibility and confessing his own fault. But what else could\r\nhe do? And if he acted thus in obedience to the orders of Halleck,\r\nthen instead of manliness, his conduct is almost treasonable towards\r\nthe people, for in withholding the truth as to the orders given by\r\nHalleck, he gives that incarnation of calamity the power to repeat\r\nthe butchery and ensure the ill success of our armies.\r\n\r\nThe report is altogether unsoldierly; it is fussy and inflated; a\r\nfull blown specimen of the pompously inane. How can Burnside venture\r\nto say that after the repulse, during three days he expected the\r\nenemy to leave his stronghold and attack him--Burnside? The rebels\r\nnever did anything to justify such a supposition. They are neither\r\nidiots nor madmen, and only from a McClellan, or some bright pupils\r\nof the McClellan school, could such imbecility, such gratuitously\r\nruinous playing into the hands of an enemy be expected. A commander\r\nought to be on the watch for any mistake that his antagonist may\r\ncommit, but he is not justified in setting that antagonist down as\r\nan ass. For two days the army was unnecessarily kept under the guns\r\nof the enemy, that is the truth, and I will make the truth known, no\r\nmatter who may try to conceal it. Here, for the present, I stop in\r\nsheer and uncontrollable disgust. By and by, however, I will return\r\nto the consideration of this report.\r\n\r\nOh! American people! In so very many respects, truly great people!\r\nFar, very far beyond my poor powers of expression are the great love\r\nand veneration with which ever and always I look upon you. But allow\r\nme, pray allow me to use the frank familiarity of a true friend, so\r\nfar as just plainly to tell you, that even I, your sincere friend,\r\nshould love you none the less, and certainly should hold you in all\r\nthe greater reverence, were you not quite so ultra-favorable in\r\njudgment of your civil and military rulers and pastors and masters\r\nand nincompoops generally!\r\n\r\nFurther back in this diary, I termed Mr. Secretary Chase a _passive\r\npatriot_. _Peccavi._ And here let me write down my recantation!\r\nChase exerted himself for the retaining of Seward in the cabinet,\r\nand it was by Chase alone that the efforts of the patriots to expel\r\nSeward, were baffled. And yet, from the first day of the official\r\nassemblage of this cabinet down to the day of the meeting of the\r\npresent session of Congress, Chase was more vigorously vicious than\r\nany other living man in daily, hourly, _all the time_, denunciation\r\nof Seward,--of course, behind Seward's back! Several insoluble\r\nproblems, no doubt, there are; but there is not one thing, physical\r\nor not physical, which so completely defies any comprehension and\r\nbaffles my most persistent inquiry, as just this.\r\n\r\nHow, unless Chase has drank of the waters of Lethe, how can he\r\npossibly look, now, in the face of, for instance, Fessenden of\r\nMaine, to whom he has said so many bitter things against the now\r\nbelauded \"Secretary Seward!\" Bah! Chase most certainly must have a\r\nforty-or-fifty-diplomatist power of commanding--literally and not\r\nslangishly be it spoken!--his _cheek_, if, without burning blushes\r\nhe can look in the face of Fessenden, Sumner or any honest man and\r\nsay,--\"I admire and I support Secretary Seward!\" God! If all who,\r\nduring the last two years, have come into contact with Chase, would\r\nbut come forward and speak out! In that case, thousands would stand\r\nforth, a \"cloud of witnesses,\" to confirm this statement. Chase!\r\nFaugh! I hereby brand him, and leave him to the bitter judgment of\r\nall men who can conscientiously claim to be even _half honest_.\r\n\r\nIn merest and barest justice to Seward, greatly as I disapprove of\r\nhis general course, I must here note the fact that he is by no means\r\naddicted to evil speaking about any one. Not that this reticence\r\nproceeds from scrupulous feeling or a proud stern spirit. Seward,\r\nhowever, never speaks evil of any one unless to destroy, and to one\r\nwho sympathises in that same amiable wish. To undermine a rival or\r\nto destroy an enemy, Seward will expend any amount of slander; but,\r\nin the absence of personal interest, Seward, though officially\r\ncivilian, is, by nature, far too good and too old a soldier to waste\r\nammunition upon worthless game.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 23._--Why could not Mr. Lincoln choose for his Secretary of\r\nState some man who has a holy and wholesome horror of pen, ink, and\r\npaper? Some man gifted with a sound brain, who never is quick at\r\nwriting a dispatch, and would demand double salary as the price of\r\nwriting one? Oh! Mr. Lincoln, had you but done this, not only would\r\nall America, but all Europe also be truly thankful for great\r\nimmunity from the curse of morbid attempts at diplomacy and\r\nstatesmanship.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 23._--Mr. Lincoln's proclamation to the butchered army! For\r\nheaven's sake let us know, pray, _pray_ let us know who was\r\nLincoln's amanuensis? I hope it was not Stanton. The army is\r\ndefiled. \"An accident,\" says this precious proclamation, \"has\r\nprevented victory.\" _What_ accident? Let the country know the\r\nprecise nature of that same accident, and the manner, time, and\r\nplace of its occurrence! Burnside talks about a fog! Oh! yes, a\r\ndeep, dense terribly foul fog--in the _cerebellum_! Is that the\r\n_accident_ of which the precious proclamation so impudently speaks?\r\nLincoln makes the wonderful discovery that the crossing and the\r\nrecrossing of the river are quite peerless, absolutely unparallelled\r\nmilitary achievements.\r\n\r\nHappy it was for the army, and happy for the country that at\r\nFredericksburgh, our heroic soldiers gave far other and nobler\r\nproofs of more than human courage and fortitude than the mere\r\ncrossing and recrossing of a river.\r\n\r\nThe _Tribune_ is either in its dotage, or still worse. Burnside's\r\nunsoldierly blundering is compared to the great victorious splendors\r\nof Asperm, Esslingen, Wagram, and the tyrant-crushing three days of\r\nimmortal Waterloo! The _Tribune_ lauds the crossing and the\r\nrecrossing of the river, as an act of superhuman bravery; and\r\nLincoln sympathises with the heavily wounded, and twaddles\r\nextensively about _comparative_ losses. Comparative to what? Oh!\r\nspirits of Napoleon and his braves; oh! spirit of true history,\r\nveil your blushing brows! And the _Tribune_ dares to make this\r\nimpudent attempt at befogging the American people, and at the same\r\ntime dares to tell that people that it is \"intelligent.\"\r\n\r\nBut let us not forget those comparative losses! Comparative to what?\r\nTo those of the enemy? What knows he about them?\r\n\r\n_Dec. 24._--Crisis in the Seward cabinet. The \"little Villain\" of\r\nthe _Times_, repeated what he did after the first \"Bull Run.\" But he\r\ndid not now confess to his dining with Seward, as formerly he did\r\nwith the great \"anaconda Scott!\" The New York Republican press is\r\nattracted to Seward by natural affinity of election. Seward,\r\nhowever, holds the honey pot, and the flies are all eager to dip\r\ninto it.\r\n\r\nI wish, yet dread to hear the exact particulars of Stanton's\r\nbehavior during the crisis in the cabinet. It is so very, _very_\r\npainful to be rudely awakened to distrust of those whom once we have\r\ntoo implicitly, too fondly believed. Lincoln has now become\r\naccustomed to Seward, as the hunchback is to his protuberance. What\r\nman who has an ugly excrescence on his face does not dread the\r\nsurgeon's knife, although he knows that momentary pain will be\r\nfollowed by permanent relief?\r\n\r\nAt the public dinner of \"The New England Society,\" John Van Buren\r\nnominated McClellan for next President, and proposed the health of\r\nSecretary Seward. _Oh! quam pulchra societas!_\r\n\r\nI am charged with being \"dissatisfied with every thing, and abusing\r\nevery body.\" The charge is unjust. I speak most lovingly and in most\r\nsincere admiration of the millions, of the great, toiling, brave,\r\nhonest People, and of the hundreds of thousands of the gallant\r\npeople-militant--the army! But I _do_ censure some thirty or forty\r\nindividuals who dispense favors and appoint to fat offices, and,\r\nquite naturally, every dirty-souled lickspittle is indignant against\r\nme therefor! The blame of such people is far preferable to their\r\npraise!\r\n\r\nI am rejoiced, I am almost proud that Hooker insisted upon crossing\r\nthe Rappahannock, and marching to Fredericksburgh, and that he\r\nopposed the subsequent attack.\r\n\r\nBut of what benefit to me is this fatal, this Cassandra gift of\r\nforeseeing? Alas! Better, happier would it be for me could I not\r\nhave foreseen and vainly, all vainly foretold, the terrible butchery\r\nof a brave people during two long and fatal years!\r\n\r\n_Dec. 24._--It is impossible to keep cool while reading Burnside's\r\nreport. Once more this report justifies and corroborates Prince\r\nNapoleon's judgment on American generals, _i. e._, that their plan\r\nof campaigns will always be deficient in practice, like the\r\ntheoretical war-exercises of schoolboys. From this sweeping and\r\nterribly true charge, however, we must except the Grants and\r\nthe--alas! how few!--Rosecranses.\r\n\r\nThe report says, \"but for the fog,\" etc. All lost battles in the\r\nworld had for cause some _buts_--except the genuine _but_--in the\r\nbrains of the commander.\r\n\r\n\"How near we came to accomplishing,\" etc.--is only a repetition of\r\nwhat, _ad nauseam_, is recorded by history as lamentations of\r\ndefeated generals.\r\n\r\n\"The battle would have been far more decisive.\" Of course it would\r\nhave been so, if--won.\r\n\r\n\"As it was, we were very near success,\" etc. So the man who takes\r\nthe chance in the lottery. He has No. 4, and No. 3 wins the prize.\r\n\r\nThe apostrophe to the heroism of the soldiers is sickly and pale.\r\nThe heroism of the soldiers! It is as brilliant, as pure, and as\r\ncertain as the sun.\r\n\r\nThe attack was planned, (see paragraph 2 of the report,) on the\r\ncircumstance or supposition that the enemy extended too much his\r\nline, and thus scattered his forces. But in paragraph 4, Burnside\r\nstated that the fog, (O, fog!) etc., gave the enemy twenty-four\r\nhours' time to concentrate his forces in his strong positions--when\r\nthe calculation based on the enemy's _division of forces_ failed,\r\nand the attack lost all the chances considered propitious.\r\n\r\nThe whole plan had for its basis probabilities and\r\nimpossibilities--schoolroom speculations--instead of being, as it\r\nought to have been, as every plan of a battle should be, based on\r\nthe chances of the _terrain_, by the position of the enemy, and\r\nother conditions, almost wholly depending upon which the armies\r\noperate. It is natural that martial Hooker objected to it.\r\n\r\nOh! could I have blood, blood, blood, instead of ink!\r\n\r\nConstructing the bridge over the Rappahannock, our engineers were\r\nkilled in scores by the sharp-shooters of the enemy. Malediction on\r\nthose imbecile staffs! The _A B C_ of warfare, and of sound common\r\nsense teach, that such works are to be made either under cover of a\r\npowerful artillery fire, or, what is still better, if possible, a\r\ngeneral sends over the river in some way, with infantry to clear its\r\nbanks, and to dislodge the enemy. In such cases one engineer saved,\r\nand time won, justify the loss of almost twenty soldiers to one\r\nworkman. Some one finally suggested an expedition and they did at\r\nthe end what ought to have been done at the start. O West Point! thy\r\nscience is marvellous! The staff treated the construction of a\r\nbridge over the Rappahannock as if it were building some railroad\r\nbridge, in times of peace!\r\n\r\nI am told that Stanton took sides with Seward. I deny it; Stanton\r\nremained rather passive. But were it true that Stanton, too, is\r\n_Sewardized_,--then, Oh Mud, how powerful thou art!\r\n\r\nIn Boston, the B.s and Curtises, and all of that kidney, make a\r\ngreat fuss and invoke the name of Webster. If so, they are only\r\n_excrementa Websteriana_.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 24._--Patriots in both Houses of Congress! your efforts to put\r\nthe conduct of the national affairs in honorable hands, and on\r\nhonorable tracks, to prevent the very life blood of the people from\r\nbeing sacrilegiously wasted, to prevent the people's wealth from\r\nbeing recklessly squandered; your efforts to introduce order and\r\nspirit in certain parts of a spiritless Administration, to fill the\r\nhigher and inferior offices with men whose hearts and minds are in\r\nthe cause, and to expel therefrom, if not absolute disloyalty, at\r\nleast, the most criminal indifference to the people's cause and\r\nwelfare; your efforts to make us speak to Europe like men of sense,\r\nand not in the senseless oracles which justly evoke the scorn and\r\nthe sneers of all European statesmen; all these your efforts as\r\npatriots rebounded against a nameless stubbornness.\r\n\r\nNevertheless you fulfilled a noble, sacred and patriotic duty.\r\nWhatever be to-day the outcry of the Flatfoots, lickspittles,\r\nintriguers, imbeciles; whatever be the subserviency or want of civic\r\ncourage in the public press--when all these stinking, suffocating,\r\ndeleterious vapors shall be destroyed by the ever-living light of\r\ntruth, then the grateful people will bless your names, which, pure\r\nand luminous, will shine high above the stupidity, conceit,\r\nheartlessness, turpitude, selfish ambition, indirect and direct\r\ntreason darkening now the national horizon.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 25._--_Christmas._ The Angel of Death hovers over thousands\r\nand thousands of hearths. Thousands and thousands of families in\r\ntears and shrouds. Communities, villages, huts and log-houses,\r\nnursing their crippled, invalid, patriotic heroes! A year ago, all\r\nwas quiet on the _Potomac_--now all is quiet on the _Rappahannock_.\r\n\r\nWhat a progress we have made in a year! and at the small,\r\ninsignificant cost of about sixty to eighty thousand killed or\r\ncrippled, and of one thousand millions of dollars! But it matters\r\nnot! The quietude of the official butchers and money squanderers is,\r\nand must remain undisturbed in their mansions, whatever be the moral\r\nleprosy dwelling therein!\r\n\r\nA young man from New England, (whom I saw for the first time,) told\r\nme that my Diary stirred up the youth. Oh, if so, then I feel happy.\r\nYouth! youth! you are all the promise and the realization! But why\r\ndo you suffer yourselves to be crushed down by the upper-crust of\r\nsenile nincompoops? Oh youth, arise, and sun-like penetrate through\r\nand through the magnitude of the work to be accomplished, and save\r\nthe cause of humanity!\r\n\r\n_Dec. 25._--As it was and is in all Revolutions and upheavals, so\r\nhere. A part of the people constitute the winners, in various ways,\r\n(through shoddy names, jobs, positions, etc.) while the immense\r\nmajority bleeds and sacrifices. Here many people left poorly\r\nsalaried desks, railroads, shops, &c. to become great men but poor\r\nstatesmen, cursed Generals, and mischief-makers in every possible\r\nway and manner. The people's true children abandoned homes,\r\nfamilies, honest pursuits of an industrious and laborious life--in\r\none word, their ALL, to bleed, to be butcherer, to die in the\r\ncountry's cause. The former are the winners, the sacrificers, and\r\nthe butchers; the second are the victims.\r\n\r\nThe evidence before the War Committee shows, to a most disgusting\r\nsatiety, that General Halleck is exclusively a red-tapist, and a\r\nsmall pettifogger, who is unworthy to be even a non-commissioned\r\nofficer; General Burnside an honest, well intentioned soldier,\r\nthoroughly brave, but as thoroughly destitute of generalship;\r\nGeneral Sumner an unquestionably brave but headlong trooper; and\r\nHooker alone in possession of all the capacity and resources of a\r\ncaptain. General Woodbury's evidence is that of a man under\r\ndifficulties, on whom his superiors in rank have thrown the\r\nresponsibility of their own crime.\r\n\r\nHalleck alone is responsible for the non-arrival of the pontoons.\r\nBurnside could not look for them; it was the duty of Halleck to\r\norder some of the semi-geniuses of his staff to the special duty of\r\nseeing to their delivery at Fredericksburgh, to give them necessary\r\npower to use roads, steamers, water, animals and men for\r\ntransportation, and make it a capital responsibility if Sumner finds\r\nnot the pontoons on the spot, and at the precise day and hour when\r\nhe wanted them. Then, Gen. Meigs, who coolly asserts that he \"gave\r\norders.\" O yes! but he never dreamed it was his duty to look for\r\ntheir execution. The fate of the campaign depended upon the\r\npontoons, and Halleck-Meigs \"gave orders,\" and there was an end of\r\nit. In any other country, such culprits would have been at the least\r\ndismissed--cashiered, if not shot; here, their influence is on the\r\nincrease. Halleck and Meigs are still great before Mr. Lincoln, and\r\nbefore the mass of nincompoops.\r\n\r\nRhetors and sham-erudites are ecstatic about Burnside's conduct.\r\nWell! Burnside is good-natured--that is all. They forget the example\r\nof Canrobert and Pellisier, in the Crimea. Canrobert, after having\r\ncommanded the army, gave up the command, and served under Pellisier.\r\nOh declaimers! Oh imbeciles! ransack not the world--let Rome alone,\r\nand its Punic wars, its Varrus, etc.--Disturb not history, which,\r\nfor you, is a book with seventy-seven seals. You understand not\r\nevents under your long noses, and before your opaque eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen in animal bodies the brains are diseased, the whole body's\r\nfunctions are more or less paralyzed. The official brains of the\r\nnation are in a morbid condition. _That_ explains all.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 27._--I wish I could succeed in bringing about the\r\norganization of a good Staff for the army. _Etat Major General de\r\nl'Armée_ Stanton seems to understand it, but the Hallecks and other\r\nWest Pointers have neither the first idea of it, nor the will to see\r\nit done.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 28._--The so-called great papers of the Republican party in\r\nNew York, as well as some would-be statesmen here, discuss the\r\nprobability of some new manifestation by Louis Napoleon, or by\r\nother European powers, of interference in our internal affairs. The\r\nprobability of such a demonstration by European meddlers can only\r\nhave one of the following causes:--Our terrible disaster at\r\nFredericksburg, or, what even is worse than that slaughter, the\r\nabsolute incapacity of our leaders to cope with such great and\r\nterrible events as this last one. The bravery, the heroism of our\r\nsoldiers will be applauded, admired, and pitied in Europe, but the\r\nutter intellectual marasmus, as shown by our administration, will\r\nand must embolden the European marplots to attempt to stop what they\r\nconsider a further unnecessary massacre. General Burnside's report,\r\nand the evidence before the War Committee are before the country and\r\nbefore Europe. Therefore Europe and our country are to judge.\r\n\r\nDuring his last visit in summer to New York, etc. the French\r\nMinister came in contact with low French adventurers, (Courriers des\r\nÉtats Unis) with copperheads and with democrats, and now he is taken\r\nwith sickly diplomatic sentimentalism to conciliate, to mediate, to\r\nunite, to meddle, and to get a feather in his diplomatic cap. I am\r\nsorry for him, for in other respects he has considerable sound\r\njudgment. _Mais il est toqué sur cette question çi._ He is ignorant\r\nof the temper of the masses, and considers the assertions of\r\nadventurers, of traitors, and of meddlers, as being the expression\r\nof the sentiments of the people. But sensible diplomats are _rari\r\naves_.\r\n\r\nHooker, because he alone is a _captain_, cannot be in command.\r\nInfamous intriguers, traitors, and imbeciles, prevent Hooker from\r\nbeing intrusted with the destinies of our army. Whole regiments\r\nclaim to serve under him, and above all such regiments as fought\r\nunder others in the peninsula, and always have been worsted, and who\r\nwish once to be led to success and victory, as were always Hooker's\r\nsoldiers. The Franklins, and other marplotters in the Potomac Army,\r\nmenace to resign if Hooker is put in command. The sooner the better\r\nfor the army to get rid of such trash. But the imbeciles and the\r\nintriguers in power think not so; and all may remain as it was, and\r\na new slaughter of our heroes may loom in the future.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 29._--General Butler's proclamation to his soldiers in New\r\nOrleans is the best and noblest document written since this war. It\r\nis good, because it records noble and patriotic deeds. During those\r\neighteen months General Butler has shown capacity, activity, energy,\r\nfertility of resources and readiness to meet any emergency,\r\nunequalled by any one in the administration or in command. And for\r\nthis, Butler is superseded, because Seward promised it to the\r\n_Decembriseur_ in the Tuilleries, and because he is a _man_, and\r\n_conservative patriots_, _alias_ traitors, could not get at him.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 30._--Angel of wrath, smite, smite! Oh, genius of humanity,\r\ntake into thy mercy this noble people! Oh, eternal reason, send the\r\nfeeblest breath of divine emanation and arrest this all-devouring\r\ntorrent of imbecility, selfishness and conceit that is reigning\r\nparamount here. Only the PEOPLE'S devotion and patriotism, only the\r\n_unnamed_ save the country!\r\n\r\n_Dec. 30._--Those foreign caterwaulings against Butler. England, in\r\n1848-9, whipped women in Ireland, and how many thousands have been\r\nmurdered by the _Decembriseur_? And the Russian minister joining in\r\nthis music. A shame for him and for his government!\r\n\r\n_Dec. 30._--Poor Greeley looks for intervention, mediation,\r\narbitration; and selects Switzerland for the fitting arbitrator! How\r\nlittle--nay--nothing at all, he knows about Switzerland and the\r\nSwiss! Stop! stop! respectable old man!\r\n\r\n_Dec. 31._--Stanton is not at all responsible for the slaughter at\r\nFredericksburgh, or for the infamy of the belated pontoons. Halleck\r\nhas the exclusive control of all military movements, etc., in the\r\nfield. But Stanton ought not be benumbed by a Halleck or a Meigs.\r\n\r\nThe people at large cannot realize the really awful position of\r\npatriotic members of Congress, and above all, of such senators as\r\nWade, Grimes, Fessenden, Wilson, Morrill, Chandler and others, or\r\nthe almost similar position of Stanton, in his contact with the\r\ndouble-dealings or the obstinacy of Lincoln.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 31._--To-morrow few, if any, shall miss the occasion to shake\r\nhands with the official butchers, with men dripping with the gore of\r\ntheir brethren. Oh, Cains! oh, fratricides!\r\n\r\n_Dec. 31._--_Midnight._--Disappear! oh year of disgraces, year of\r\nslaughters and of sacrifices.\r\n\r\n  _Tschto den griadoustchi nam gotowit?_ (Puschkine.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ring out the false, ring in the true,\r\n  Ring out the grief that saps the mind,\r\n         *             *            *\r\n         *             *            *\r\n  Ring in REDRESS _for all mankind_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY, 1863.\r\n\r\n     Proclamation -- Parade -- Halleck -- Diplomats -- Herodians --\r\n     Inspired Men -- War Powers -- Rosecrans -- Butler -- Seward --\r\n     Doctores Constitutionis -- Hogarth -- Rhetors -- European Enemies\r\n     -- Second Sight -- Senator Wright the Patriot -- Populus Romanus\r\n     -- Future Historian -- English People -- Gen. Mitchell -- Hooker\r\n     in Command -- Staffs -- Arming Africo-Americans -- Thurlow Weed,\r\n     &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jan. 1._--The morning papers. No proclamation! Has Lincoln played\r\nfalse to humanity?\r\n\r\nThe proclamation will appear. All right so far! Hallelujah! How the\r\nfriends of darkness, how the demons must wince and tremble.\r\n\r\nThere! Red-tape commander-in-chief, field marshal (who never saw a\r\nfield of battle!) parades at the head of victorious generals, of\r\nintelligent staffs, of active pontoon providers, and of really and\r\nhighly qualified quartermasters general. To the White House! They\r\nwill congratulate Mr. Lincoln. Upon what? Upon Fredericksburgh and\r\nother massacres; but especially they will congratulate Mr. Lincoln\r\nupon the fact of his being surrounded by such a bright galaxy of\r\nknow-nothings and do-nothings!\r\n\r\nDeath-knell to slavery and to the slaveocracy. The foulest relic of\r\nthe past will at length be destroyed. The new era has a glorious\r\ndawn; it rises in the glories of sacrifices made by a generous and\r\ninspired people. Yes! The new era rises above darkness, selfishness,\r\nand imbecility. The shades of the slaughtered are now at length\r\npropitiated; their slaughter is at least in part atoned for; and\r\noutraged humanity is, at least in part, avenged! Let rebels and\r\nconservatives remain hardened in crime; a just and condign vengeance\r\nshall overtake them.\r\n\r\n  _Nunc pede libero\r\n   Pulsanda tellus._\r\n\r\n_Jan. 2._--Shallow and brainless diplomats sneer at the\r\nproclamation. So did the Herodians sneer at the star of Bethlehem;\r\nand where now are the Herodians? Oh! shallow and heartless\r\ndiplomats, your days are numbered, too!\r\n\r\n_Jan. 2._--A man inspired by conviction and glowing with a fervent\r\nfaith, thoroughly knows what he is about. Strong in his faith, and\r\nby his faith, he clearly sees his way, and steadily walks in it,\r\nwhile others grope hither and thither amidst shadows and darkness\r\nand bewildering doubts! Such a man boldly takes the initiative,\r\nmarches onward, and is as a beacon-light to a nation, to a people;\r\noften, sometimes, even for all humanity. A man who has a profound\r\nfaith in his convictions has coruscations, fierce flashes of that\r\nsecond-sight for the signs of the times. The mere trimming and\r\nselfish politician is ever ready to swim with the stream which he\r\nhad neither strength nor skill to breast; he never ventures to take\r\nthe initiative. In issuing the proclamation, Mr. Lincoln gives legal\r\nsanction, form, and record to what the storm of events and the loud\r\ncry of the best of the people have long demanded and now inexorably\r\ndictate.\r\n\r\nHistory will pitilessly tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing\r\nbut the truth; and small credit will history give to Lincoln beyond\r\nthat of being the legal recorder of a righteous deed, and not even\r\nthat credit will be given to the countersigner, Seward.\r\n\r\nMr. Seward countersigned both proclamations of freedom. Europe is\r\nfilled with his despatches, written at first plainly for, then\r\nlukewarmly tolerating, and, at length, flatly against, slavery.\r\nEuropean statesmen have thus the exact measure of Mr. Seward's\r\npolitical character. They know that to the very last he defended\r\nslavery, and then countersigned the decree of its destruction! In\r\nEurope, self-respecting statesmen resign rather than countersign a\r\nmeasure which they disapprove or have strongly opposed.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 3._--Emancipation under war powers. A mistake by a\r\ncontradiction. Spoke of it before. And nevertheless: under war\r\npowers alone, emancipation is palatable to a great many, nay, almost\r\nto millions of small, narrow intellects, dried up by the formulas,\r\nand who in the Constitution see only the latter, and not the\r\nexpanding, all-embracing principle and spirit. O, Rabbis! O,\r\nTalmudists!\r\n\r\nLincoln is very unhappy in his phraseology. He invites the\r\nsympathies of humanity on a measure decided by him to favor the war.\r\nIt is a contradiction; humanity and war are antipodic.\r\n\r\nThe papers in the confidence of Seward, such as the _Intelligencer_\r\n(without intelligence,) the border-state friends of Lincoln, and all\r\nthat is muddy and rotten, even the supposed to be well-informed\r\ndiplomats unanimously assert that Mr. Lincoln has no confidence in\r\nhis proclamation. As for Seward--this Lincoln's evil genius--no\r\ndoubt exists concerning his contempt for the proclamation. Ask the\r\ndiplomats. But these highest pilots in this administration are\r\nbound--as by a terrible oath--to violate all the laws of psychology,\r\nof human nature, of sense, of logic and of honor, to make the people\r\nbleed and suffer in its honor.\r\n\r\nWell, pompous Chase; how do you feel for having sided with Seward?\r\n\r\nGen. Butler's farewell proclamation to New Orleans rings the purest\r\nand most patriotic harmony. Compare Butler's with Lincoln's\r\nwritings. All the hearts in the country resounded with Butler; and\r\nbecause he acted as he did, Lincoln-Seward-Blair-Halleck's policy\r\nshelved Butler.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 3._--By the united efforts of Lincoln-Seward-Blair, of the\r\n_Herald_, and of that cesspool of infamies, the _World_, of\r\nMcClellan, and of his tail, by the stupifying influence of Halleck,\r\nthe Potomac army, notwithstanding its matchless heroism, and\r\nequipped as well as any army in Europe; up to this day the Potomac\r\narmy serves to--establish--the military superiority of the rebels,\r\nto morally strengthen, nay, even to nurse the rebellion.\r\nLincoln-Halleck dare not entrust the army into the hands of a true\r\nsoldier,--Stanton is outvoted. The next commander inherits all the\r\nfaults generated by Lincoln, McClellan, Halleck, Burnside, and it\r\nwould otherwise tax a Napoleon's brains to reorganize the army but\r\nfor the patriotic spirit of the rank and file and most of the\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 3._--What a pity that petty, quibbling constitutionalism\r\nalone is understood by Lincoln and by his followers. To\r\nemancipate in virtue of a war power is scarcely to perform half the\r\nwork, and is a full logical incongruity. Like all kind of war power,\r\nthat of the president has for its geographical limits the pickets of\r\nhis army--has no executive authority beyond, besides being\r\nobligatory only as long as bayonets back it. Such a power cannot\r\nchange social and municipal conditions, laws or relations (see Vol.\r\nI.)\r\n\r\nThe civil power of the president penetrates beyond the pickets, and\r\nin virtue of that civil power, and of the sacred duty to save the\r\nfatherland, the President of the United States, and not the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, can say to the slaves: \"Arise, you are free, you\r\nhave no servitude, no duties towards a rebel and traitor to the\r\nUnion. I, the president, dissolve your bonds in the name of the\r\nAmerican people.\"\r\n\r\n_Jan. 4._--How the tempest of events changes or modifies principles.\r\nThe South rebelled in the name of State rights, and now Jeff Davis\r\nabsorbs all States and all parliamentary rights for the sake of\r\n_salus populi_ or rather of _salus_ of slavocracy. Jeff Davis\r\nnominates officers in the regiments whatever be the opposition of\r\nthe respective Governors. In the North, the Governors, all of them,\r\n(Seymour?) true patriots, insist upon power and the right to\r\norganize new regiments, and resist the centralization by the United\r\nStates Government. Perhaps--as the satraps and martinets\r\nassert--thereby the organisation of the army is thrown on a false\r\ntrack. Whether so or not, one thing is certain, but for the States\r\nand Governors, Lincoln, Scott, Seward, McClellan, Halleck, or the\r\nUnion, would be nowhere.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 4._--They fight battles in the West. Generals, to be\r\nvictorious, must be in spiritual and in electric communion with the\r\nheroic soldiers. So it was at Murfreesborough. Rosecrans, at the\r\nhead of his cavalry or body guard, dashes in the thickest, and turns\r\nthe dame fortune, who smiles on heroes, but never smiled on\r\nMcClellan nor on his tail. Rosecrans sticks not to regulations, and\r\nkeeps not a few miles in the rear. Franklin, at Fredericksburgh\r\nmounted not even his horse but stood in front of his tent. Similar\r\nto Rosecrans here was Kearney, the bravest of the brave, more of a\r\ncaptain than any of the West-Point high-nosed nurslings; so is\r\nHeintzelman, Hooker, Reno, Sigel and many, many others, whom\r\nMcClellanism, Halleckism, Lincolnism kept or keeps down.\r\n\r\nI positively learned that in the last days of the summer of 1862, a\r\nlist without heading circulated in the Potomac army, and all who\r\nsigned it bound themselves to obey only McClellan. The McClellan\r\nclique originated this conspiracy, which extended throughout all the\r\ngrades.\r\n\r\nWhat confusion prevails about the rights of existence of slavery.\r\nHow they discuss it. How they pettifog. Why not establish the\r\nrights of existence of syphilis, of _plica_ in the human body. O,\r\ncasuists. O, _Intelligencers_. O, _Worlds_!\r\n\r\nWell, to me, slavery seems to legally (cursed legality) exist in\r\nvirtue of the special State rights, and not in virtue of the\r\nConstitution. But for the State rights, the Africo-American is a man\r\nand citizen of the United States--and this under the Constitution\r\nwhich is paramount to State rights. The rebellion annihilates the\r\nState rights, and all special constitutions guaranteed by the Union,\r\nand at the same time annihilates the relation of the Africo-American\r\nto the specific States or constitutions. It restores to him the\r\nrights of man guaranteed to him as man by the Union and the\r\nConstitution of the United States. The Africo-American recovers his\r\nrights, lost and annihilated by specific State rights and municipal,\r\nlocal laws. The president had to issue his proclamation as guardian\r\nand executor of the Constitution, and then Africo-Americans\r\nrecovered their citizenship on firmer and broader grounds than\r\nunder, or by the war power. Calhoun, the father of the rebellion--as\r\nMilton's Satan--and all the rebels now curse or cursed the preamble\r\nof the Constitution as Satan cursed the light. I suppose Calhoun's\r\nand the rebels' reasons are similar to me. _Inde iræ._\r\n\r\nThe commanders in the West bear evidence of the devotion, the\r\nheroism and the endurance of the Africo-Americans, sacrificing their\r\nlives without hope; martyrs by the rebels as well as by Hallecks and\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\nI met a farmer from Maine. He was rather old and poor. Had two\r\nsons--lost them both--they were all his hope. He spoke simply of it,\r\nbut to break one's heart. _He grudged not_, (his own words,) his\r\nhopes and blood for the cause, and considered it good luck to have\r\nrecovered the body of one of his boys, and brought it back home to\r\nthe \"old woman,\" (wife, mother.) I shook hands with him. I ought to\r\nhave kissed him. Unknown, unnamed hero-patriot! and similar are\r\nhundreds of thousands, and such is the true people. And so\r\nsacrilegiously dealt with by insane helplessness.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 5._--The _Doctors Constitutionis_ break their formula brains\r\nconcerning the constitutionality of the proclamation, and foretell\r\nendless complications. If so, if complications arise, the reasons\r\nthereof are moral, logical and practical. 1st.--The emancipation was\r\nneither conceived nor executed in love; but it was for Lincoln as\r\nVulcan for Jupiter. The proclamation is generated neither by\r\nLincoln's brains, heart or soul, and what is born in such a way is\r\nalways monstrous. 2d.--Legally and logically, the proclamation has\r\nthe smallest and the most narrow basis that could have been\r\nselected. When one has the free choice between two bases, it is more\r\nlogical to select the broader one. The written Constitution had\r\nneither slavery nor emancipation in view, but it is in the preamble,\r\nand the emancipation ought to be deduced from the preamble. Many\r\nother reasons can be enumerated pregnant with complications and\r\nabove all when Lincoln-Seward are the _accoucheurs_. My hope and\r\nconfidence is in the logic of events always stronger than man's\r\nhelplessness and imbecility.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 5._--European rulers, wiseacres, meddlers, humbugs, traitors,\r\ndemons, diplomats, assert that they must interfere here because\r\nEuropean interests suffer by the war. Indeed! You have the whole old\r\ncontinent and Australia to boot, and about nine hundreds millions of\r\npopulation; can you not organise yourself so as not to depend from\r\nus? And if by your misrules, etc., our interests were to suffer, you\r\nwould find very strange any complaint made on our part. Keep aloof\r\nwith your good wishes, and with your advices, and with your\r\ninterference. You may burn your noses, and even lose your little\r\nscalps. You robbers, murderers, hypocrites, surrounded by your\r\nliveried lackeys, you presumptuous, arrogant curses of the human\r\nrace, stand off, and let these people whose worst criminal is a\r\nsaint when compared to a Decembriseur--let this people work out its\r\ndestinies, be it for good or for evil.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 5._--Early in December, 1860, therefore soon after Mr.\r\nLincoln's election, a shrewd and clear-sighted politician, Gen.\r\nWalsh, from New York, visited Springfield, and made his bow to the\r\nrising sun. On his return from the Illinois Medira, I asked the\r\ngeneral what was his opinion concerning the new President. \"Well,\r\nsir,\" was the general's answer, \"in parting, I advised Mr. Lincoln\r\nto get a very eminent man for his private secretary.\"--_Sapienti\r\nsat._\r\n\r\n_Jan. 6._--Oh for a voice of thousand storms to render justice to\r\nthe patriots in Congress, to make the masses of the people know and\r\nappreciate them, and to show up the littleness and the ignorance of\r\nthe pillars of the Republican press. Never and in no country has the\r\nso-called good press shown itself so below the great emergencies of\r\nthe day as are the old hacks semperliving in the press.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 7._--The great military qualities shown by Gen. Rosecrans,\r\nthrilled with joy all the best men in the Potomac Army. The war\r\nhorse Hooker is the loudest to admire Rosecrans. Happy the Western\r\nheroes to be beyond the immediate influence of Washington--of the\r\nWhite House--and above all, of such as Halleck!\r\n\r\nRosecrans has revealed all the higher qualities of a captain;\r\ncoolness, resolution, stubbornness and inspiration. His army began\r\nto break,--he ordered the attack on the whole line, and thus\r\ntransformed defeat into victory. Not of McClellan's school, is\r\nRosecrans.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 7._--Senator Sumner who, during the ministerial crisis, ought\r\nto have exposed to the country the mischievous direction given by\r\nMr. Seward to our foreign relations, and who ought to have done it\r\nnobly, boldly, authoritatively, patriotically, and from his\r\nSenatorial chair, Senator Sumner's preferred to keep stoically\r\nquiet, notwithstanding that his personal friends and the country\r\nexpected it from him. Yet next to Chase, Senator Sumner, more than\r\nany body, attacks Seward in private conversation! I read in the\r\npapers that Senator Sumner's influence on Mr. Lincoln is\r\nconsiderable (nevertheless Seward remained as the greatest curse to\r\nthe country,) and that he, Sumner, is a _power behind the throne_.\r\nHas Sumner insinuated this himself to some newspaper reporter in\r\n_extremis_ for news? _Power behind the throne_, what a tableau:\r\nSumner and Lincoln! O, Hogarth, O, Callot! Oh, for your crayon! and\r\nnow--of course--the country is safe, having such _Power behind the\r\nthrone_.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lincoln's good intentions_ I hear talked about right and left.\r\nOh, for one sensible, good, energetic action, and all his intentions\r\nmay go where the French proverb puts them.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 7._--The city crowded with Major Generals and\r\nBrigadier-Generals not in activity. When Mr. Lincoln is cornered,\r\nthen he makes a Brigadier or a Major General, according to\r\ncircumstances and in obedience to political or to backstairs\r\ninfluence. From the beginning of the war, no sound notions directed\r\nthe nominations, either under Cameron, Scott, or McClellan, or now;\r\nat the beginning of the war they had Generals without troops, then\r\ntroops without Generals, and now they have Generals who have not\r\ncommanded, or cannot command, troops. If, during the war in Poland\r\nin 1831, Warsaw, the Capital, had been overrun in such a way by\r\ndo-nothing Generals, the chambermaids in the city would have taken\r\nthe affair into their fair hands, and armed with certain night\r\neffluvia made short work with the military drones.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 8._--A poor negro woman with her child was refused entrance\r\ninto the cars. It snowed and stormed, and she was allowed to shiver\r\non the platform. A so-called abolitionist Congress and President\r\ngave the charter to the constructors of the city railroad and the\r\nmembers of Congress have free tickets, and the Africo-American is\r\ntreated as a dog. Human honesty and justice!\r\n\r\n_Jan. 8._--Horse contracts the word. Never in my life saw I the\r\nhorse so maltreated and the cavalry so poorly, badly, brainlessly\r\norganised, drilled and used. Some few exceptions change not the\r\ntruth of my assertions, and McClellan is considered a great\r\norganiser. They ruin more horses here in this war than did Napoleon\r\nI. in Russia, (I speak not of the cold which killed thousands at\r\nonce.)\r\n\r\nHow ignorant and conceited! Halleck solicits Rarey, the horse-tamer,\r\nfor instructions. O, Halleck, you are unique! Officers who have\r\nserved in armies with large, good, well-organised and well-drilled\r\ncavalry--such officers will teach you more than Rarey. But such\r\nofficers are from Europe, and it would be a shame for a West-Point\r\nincarnation of ignorance and conceit to learn anything from an\r\nofficer of European experience. Bayard, however, thought not so.\r\nJustice to his name.\r\n\r\nThe rebels are not so conceited as the simon pure West-Pointers.\r\nAbove all the rebels wish success, and have no objections to learn;\r\nthey imported good European cavalry officers, and have now under\r\nStuart (his chief of staff is a Prussian officer) a cavalry which\r\nhas made a mark in this war.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 8._--O rhetors! O, rhetors! malediction upon you and upon the\r\npoliticians! You have no heart, no sensibilities. Not one, not one\r\nhas yet uttered a single word for the fallen, for the suffering, the\r\ndying and nameless heroes of our armies. It seems, O rhetors and\r\npoliticians! that the people ought to bleed that you may prosper.\r\nCorpses are needed for your stepping stones! The fallen are not\r\nmentioned now in Congress, as you never mentioned them in your poor\r\nstump speeches. O, you whitened sepulchres!\r\n\r\nO rhetors and politicians! O, powers on, before, and \"behind the\r\nthrone!\" In your selfish, heartless conceit, you imagine that the\r\nEmancipation is and will be your work, and will be credited to you.\r\nOh yes, but by old women.\r\n\r\nThe people's blood, the fallen heroes, tore the divine work of\r\nemancipation, from the hands of jealously watching demons. To the\r\nshadows of the fallen the glory, and not to your round, polished or\r\nunpolished phrases. Not the pen with which the proclamation was\r\nwritten is a trophy and a relic, but the blood steaming to heaven,\r\nthe corpses of the fallen, corpses mouldering scattered on all the\r\nfields of the Union.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 8._--As a rapid spring tide, so higher and higher, and with\r\nall parties--even, with the decided Copperheads--rises the haughty\r\ncontempt toward the crowned, the official, the aristocratic, and the\r\nflatfooted (livery stable) part of Europe. Good and just! Marshy,\r\nrotten rulers and aristocrats who scarcely can keep your various\r\nshaky and undermined seats, you and your lackeys, you take on airs\r\nof advisors, of guardians, of initiators of civilization! Forsooth!\r\nI except Russia. In Russia the sovereign, his ministers and\r\nnine-tenths of the aristocracy are in _uni sono_ with the whole\r\nnation; and all are against slavery, against the rebels, against\r\ntraitors. The Russian government and the Russian nation often are\r\nmisrepresented by their official or diplomatic agents.\r\n\r\nAny well organized American village in the free States contains more\r\ngenuine, moral and intellectual civilization than prevails among\r\nEuropean higher circles, those gilded pasteboards. This is all that\r\nyou, you conceited advisors, represent in that splendid,\r\nall-embracing edifice of civilization! At the best you are\r\nornaments, or--with Wilhelm von Humboldt--you are culture, but not\r\nthe higher, man-inspiring civilization. A John S. Mill, a Godwin\r\nSmith, and those many outside of the _would-be-something_ strata in\r\nEngland, in France, almost the whole Germany, those are the\r\nrepresentatives of the genuine civilized Europe.\r\n\r\nThe freemen of the North, on whom you European exquisites look\r\nsuperciliously down with your albino eyes, the freemen of the North,\r\nbleeding in this deadly struggle, are the confessors for the general\r\ncivilization, and stand on the level with any martyrs, with any\r\nprogressive people on record on history.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 9._--Quo, quo scelesti ruitis.........\r\n\r\nIt is maddening to witness for so many months the reckless waste of\r\nmen, of time, of money, and of material means, and all this\r\nsquandered by governmental and administrative helplessness and\r\nconceit. In the military part, notwithstanding Stanton's devotion\r\nand efforts, that Halleck, _excrementum Scotti_, as by appointment,\r\ncarries out everything contrary to common sense, to well established\r\nand experienced (Halleck and experience, ah!... military practice,\r\nand Mr. Lincoln is as perfectly) charmed by it, as is the innocent\r\nbird by the snake.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the sacrifices and the blood of the people run out as does\r\nthe mighty Rhine--they run out in sand. O, Lincoln-Seward's domestic\r\npolicy. O, Lincoln-Halleck's war power! You make one shudder as with\r\na death pang.\r\n\r\n_January 9._--The worshippers of slavery, that is, the Democrats, of\r\nthe Seymour's, Wood's, and the _World's_ church, call the war waged\r\nfor the defence of human rights, for civilization and for\r\nmaintaining the genuine rational self-government, they call it an\r\nunholy war. In some respects the Copperheads are right. The holy war\r\nloses its holiness in the hands of Lincoln, Seward, Halleck, and\r\ntheir disciples and followers, because those leaders violate all the\r\nlaws of logic and of reason, this holy of holies. At times I would\r\nprefer peace than see devoted men so recklessly murdered by such....\r\n\r\nA critique of the first volume of the \"Diary\" asserts that all my\r\nstatements are made after the events occurred, _ex post_. To a very\r\nrespectable General I showed a part of the original manuscript which\r\nsquared with the printed book. Often I am ashamed to find that the\r\nbit of study and experience acquired by me goes so far when compared\r\nwith many around me, and in action. I foresee, because I have no\r\nearthly personal views, no cares, nothing in the world to think of\r\nor to aim at, no charms, no ties--only my heart, my ideas, my\r\nconvictions, and civilization is my worship. Nothing prevents me,\r\nday and night, from concentrating whatever powers and reading I can\r\nhave in one single focus. This cause, this people, this war, its\r\nconduct, are the events amidst which I breathe. Uninterruptedly I\r\nturn and return all that is in my mind--that is all. And I am proud\r\nto have my heart in harmony with my head.\r\n\r\nAlmost every event has its undercurrent, and of ten the little\r\nundercurrents pre-eminently shape the events themselves. The truth\r\nof this axiom is illustrated principally in the recall of the\r\nresolute, indefatigable, far and clear-sighted patriot and\r\nstatesman, General Butler. To jump to a conclusion without much ado,\r\nthe recall of Butler from New Orleans is due principally, if not\r\neven exclusively, to the united efforts--or conspiracy--of Mr.\r\nSeward and Mr. Reverdy Johnson. Thirteen months ago Mr. Seward\r\nexpected, as he still expects for the future, an uprising of a Union\r\nParty in the hottest hot-bed of Secessia. That such are the\r\nSecretary of State's expectations, I emphatically assert, and as\r\nproof, it may be stated that only yesterday, January 9th, Mr. Seward\r\nmost authoritatively tried to impress upon foreign diplomats the\r\nspeedy reunion and _restoration_ of the Union as it was,\r\nnotwithstanding the Proclamation, _still considered by the Secretary\r\nof State_ as being _a waste of paper_. How far the foreign diplomats\r\nbelieve the like oracular decisions, is another question; certain it\r\nis that they shrug their shoulders.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Butler and New Orleans. The patriotic activity by\r\nwhich General Butler won, conquered and maintained the rebel city\r\nfor the Union, was emphatically considered by Mr. Seward, as\r\ncrushing out every spark of any latent Union feeling among the\r\nrebels. Thurlow Weed, then abroad, urged Mr. Seward to find out the\r\nsaid Union feeling, to blow it into almighty fire and to rely\r\nexclusively upon it. Here Reverdy Johnson was and is, the principal\r\nUnion crony of the Secretary of State, and Seaton of the\r\n_Intelligencer_; but above all, since the murder of Massachusetts\r\nmen at Baltimore in 1861, Reverdy Johnson was the devoted advocate\r\nof all rich traitors, as the Winans and others, who were called by\r\nhim \"misled Union men.\" When Gen. Butler dealt deserved justice to\r\nrich traitors in New Orleans, the Washington Unionists surrounding\r\nMr. Chase and Mr. Seward--some of them from New Orleans--urged an\r\ninvestigation. The Secretary of State eagerly seized the occasion to\r\ndispatch to the Crescent City Mr. Reverdy Johnson with the principal\r\nsecret mission to gather together the elements of the scattered\r\nUnion feeling in Louisiana and in the South, and to make them\r\nblaze--in honor of the Secretary of State. It was a rich harvest in\r\nevery way for Reverdy Johnson; he harvested it, and on his return\r\nfully convinced the Secretary of State, that the Union could not be\r\nsaved if Gen. Butler remained in his command in the Department of\r\nthe Gulf.\r\n\r\nThis surreptitious undermining of General Butler by the Secretary of\r\nState, is one more evidence of how truly patriotic was the effort of\r\nthe Republican Senators and Congressmen to liberate the President\r\nand the country from the all-choking and all-poisoning influence of\r\nMr. Seward, and how cursed must remain forever the conduct of Mr.\r\nChase, who, after having during two years cried against Seward,\r\naccusing him almost of treason, when the hour struck, preferred to\r\nembarrass the patriots and the President rather that to let Mr.\r\nSeward retire and deprive the people of his _patriotic_ services. It\r\nwas moreover expected that, thus warned by the patriots, the\r\nPresident would seize the first occasion to infuse energy into his\r\nCabinet. But there is a Mr. Usher, a docile nonentity, made\r\nSecretary of the Interior; of course the Secretary of State will be\r\nstrengthened thereby.\r\n\r\n_January 10._--Senator Wright of Indiana, in an ardent and lofty--of\r\ncourse, not rhetorical, speech, hit the nail on the head, when,\r\nrendering due homage to Rosecrans, he called him \"the first general\r\nwho fights for the people and not for the White House.\" The greatest\r\npraise for the man, and the most saddening picture of our internal\r\nsores.\r\n\r\n_January 10._--As the pure _populus Romanus_ had an inborn aversion\r\nto Kings and diadems, and could not patiently bear their\r\nneighborhood, so the genuine American Democrat, one by principles\r\nand not by a party name or by a party organization, such a Democrat\r\nfeels it to be death for his institutions to have slavocracy in his\r\ncountry or in its neighborhood.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 10._--O how is to be pitied the future historian of this\r\nbloody tragedy! Through what a loathsome cesspool of documentary\r\nevidence, preserved in the various State Archives, the unhappy\r\nhistorian will have to wade, and wade deep to his chin. Original\r\nworks of Lincoln, Seward, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to play a game at chess with a far superior player, then\r\nat least one learns something; but impossible to sit at a chess\r\nboard with a child who throws all into confusion. The national\r\nchessboard is very confused in the White House. Cunning is good for,\r\nand only succeeds in dealing with, mean and petty facts.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 10._--Halleck's congratulatory order to Rosecrans and to the\r\nWestern heroes. How cold and pedantic. How differently, how\r\nenthusiastically and fiery rang Stanton's words on the capture of\r\nforts Henry and Donelson and to Lander's (now dead) troops. Why is\r\nStanton silent? Is it the Constitution, the Statute, is it the\r\nincarnate four years formula which seals Stanton's heart and brains?\r\nor is Stanton eaten up by the rats in the Cabinet?\r\n\r\n_January 10._--The messages of the loyal Governors, not copperheads,\r\n(as is Seymour of N. Y.) above all, the message of Andrew of\r\nMassachusetts, throw a ray of hope and promise over this dark, cold,\r\nunpatriotic confusion so eminent here in Washington. This confusion,\r\nthis groping, double-dealing and helplessness can be only cured by a\r\nwonder, or else all will be lost. The wonder is daily perpetrated by\r\nthe all enduring, all-sacrificing people.\r\n\r\nThose criminals who ought to have been shot, or, at the mildest,\r\ncashiered for the slaughter at Fredericksburgh, the engineers,\r\nmock-Jominis, the sham soldiers: all these Washington engineers of\r\nthat recent butchery, assert now, that, after all, the possession of\r\nFredericksburgh was immaterial; that Lee would have then selected a\r\nbetter position. All this is thrown to the public to palliate the\r\ncrime of the Washington military conclave, and to weaken and\r\ninvalidate Hooker's evidence before the War Committee. It must be\r\nadmitted that if Hooker--having fifty thousand in hand, and one\r\nhundred thousand in his rear, had seized the Fredericksburgh\r\nheights, he would not have allowed Lee to so easily select a\r\nposition and to fortify it. Nay, I suppose, that not only Hooker,\r\nbut even a Halleck, a Cullum or a Meigs would have prevented Lee\r\nfrom settling in any comfortable position. However, I might be\r\nmistaken. Corinth, Corinth, for Halleck. Those great nightcaps here\r\nhave so original and so new military conceptions, their general\r\ncomprehension of warfare so widely differs from science, experience,\r\nand from common sense, that, holding Fredericksburgh they might have\r\ninvited Lee to select whatever he wanted as a strong position.\r\n\r\nI learn that Halleck is at work to translate some French military\r\nbook. What an inimitable narrow-minded pedant. If Halleck had\r\nbrains, he could not have an hour leisure for translation. But in\r\nsuch way he humbugs Mr. Lincoln, who looks on Halleck as the\r\nquintessence of military knowledge and genius. A man who can\r\ntranslate a French book must be a genius. Is it not so, Lincoln? And\r\nthus Halleck translates a book instead of taking care that the\r\npontoons be sent in time; and Halleck prepared sheets for the press,\r\nand our soldiers to be massacred.\r\n\r\nBurnside prepares a movement; Franklin, to undermine Burnside, to\r\nappear great, or to get hold of the army, denounces Burnside\r\nsecretly to the President: the President forbids the movement. What\r\na confusion! Mr. Lincoln, either accept Burnside's resignation,\r\nwhich he has repeatedly offered, or kick down the denouncers.\r\nAccident made me discover almost next day, the names of the two\r\ngenerals sent by Franklin on this denunciatory errand--John Cochran\r\nand Newton. I instantly told all to Stanton, who was almost ignorant\r\nof Franklin's surreptitiousness. I also told it to several Senators.\r\n\r\nThe Army of the Potomac is altogether demoralized--above all, in the\r\nhigher grades. It could not be otherwise if they were angels.\r\nMcClellanism was and is propitious to general disorder, and how Mr.\r\nLincoln improves is exemplified above. Independent men, independent\r\nSenators and Representatives who approach Mr. Lincoln, find him\r\npeevish, irritable, intractable to all patriots. _All these are\r\ncriteria of a lofty mind and character._ Weed, Seward, Harris,\r\nBlair, and such ones alone, are agreeable in the White House.\r\n\r\nSo much is spoken of the war powers of the President; I study, and\r\nstudy, and cannot find them as absolute as the Lincolnites construe\r\nthem. All that I read in the Constitution are the real _war powers_\r\nin the Congress, and the President is only the executor of those\r\npowers. The President must have permission for every thing, almost\r\nat every step--and has no right to issue decrees. He has no war\r\npowers over those of Congress, and can act very little on his own\r\nhook. It seems to me that Congress, misled, confused by casuists,\r\nexpounders, and by small intellects worshipping routine, that\r\nCongress rather abdicated their powers, and that the bunglers around\r\nLincoln, in his name greedily seized the above powers.\r\n\r\nPoor Lincoln! As the devil dreads holy water, so Mr. Lincoln dreads\r\nto be surrounded with stern, earnest, ardent, patriotic advisers.\r\nSuch men would not listen to stories!\r\n\r\n_January 11._--The thus-called metropolitan press is in the hands of\r\nold politicians, old hacks--and no new forces or intellects pierce\r\nthrough. It is a phenomenon. In any whatever country in Europe, at\r\nevery convulsion the press bristles with new, fresh intellects.\r\nHere, the old nightcaps have the monopoly. Farther: those\r\nrespectable fossils reside at a distance from the focus of affairs,\r\nare not directly in contact with events and men, and are in no\r\ncommunion with them. The Grand Lamas of the press depend for\r\ninformation upon the correspondents, who catch news and ideas at\r\nrandom, and nourish with them their employers and the public.\r\n\r\n_January 11._--Senator Sumner has made a motion to give homesteads\r\nto the liberated Africo-Americans. That is a better and a nobler\r\naction than all his declamations put together.\r\n\r\n_January 12._--Sentinels in double line surrounding the White House.\r\nOdious, ridiculous, unnecessary, and an aspect unwonted in this\r\ncountry--giving the aspect to the White House of an abode of a\r\ntyrant, when it is only that of a shifting politician. It is\r\nHalleck, who, with the like futilities and absurdities, amuses\r\nLincoln and gets the better of him.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln is very depressed at the condition of the Army of the\r\nPotomac, and decides--nothing for its reorganization. But for\r\nHalleck, Stanton would reorganize and give a new and healthy life to\r\nthe army. I mean the upper grades, and not the rank and file, who\r\nare patriotic and healthy.\r\n\r\nAfter Corinth, Halleck-Buell disorganized the Western, now Halleck\r\nis at work to do the same with the Potomac Army. I know that in the\r\npresence of a diplomat, Halleck complained that he is paid only five\r\nthousand dollars, and earned by far more in California. He had\r\nbetter return to California and to his pettifogging.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of this Administration, Mr. Seward wrote, I am\r\nsure, more dispatches than France, England, Prussia, Russia,\r\nAustria, Spain, and Italy put together during the Crimean war, and\r\nup to this day. Great is ink, and paper is patient!\r\n\r\n_January 13._--It is more than probable that Mr. Mercier stirred up,\r\nor at least heartily supported the mediation scheme. The Frenchmen\r\nin New York maintain that Mr. Mercier derives his knowledge of\r\nAmerica and his political inspirations from that foul sheet, the\r\n_Courrier des États Unis_. There is some truth in this assertion, as\r\nthe reasons enumerated to justify mediation can be found in various\r\nnumbers of that sheet. I am sorry that Mr. Mercier has fallen so\r\nlow; as for his master, he is a fit associate for the _Courrier_.\r\n\r\n_January 13._--Ralph Waldo Emerson, inspired and not silenced by the\r\nstorm. He alone stands up from among the Athenian school. He alone\r\nis undaunted. So would be Longfellow, but for the terrible domestic\r\ncalamity whose crushing blow no man's heart could resist. I never\r\nwas a great admirer of Emerson, but now I bow, and burn to him my\r\nhumble incense.\r\n\r\n_January 15._--The patriotic, and at times inspired orator--not\r\nrhetor--Kelly, from Pennsylvania, told me that all is at sixes and\r\nsevens in the Administration, and in the army. I believe it. How\r\ncould it be otherwise, with Lincoln, Seward and Halleck at the head?\r\n\r\nMr. Seward did his utmost to defeat the re-election of Judge Potter\r\nfrom Wisconsin, one among the best and noblest patriots in the\r\ncountry. For this object Mr. Seward used the influence of the\r\npro-Catholic Bonzes. Then Mr. Seward wrote a letter denying all\r\nthis--a letter which not in the least convinced the brave Judge, as\r\nI have it from himself.\r\n\r\nIf all the lies could only be ferreted out with which Seward\r\nbamboozles Lincoln, even the God of Lies himself would shudder.\r\n\r\n_January 15._--The noble and lofty voice of the genuine English\r\npeople, the voice of the working classes, begins to be heard. The\r\npeople re-echo the key-note struck by a J. S. Mills, by a Bright, a\r\nCobden, and others of like pure mind and noble heart. The voice of\r\nthe genuine English people resounds altogether differently from the\r\nshrill _falsetto_ with which turf hunters, rent-roll devourers,\r\nlords, lordlings, and all the like shams and whelps try to\r\nintimidate the patriotic North, and comfort the traitors, the\r\nrebels.\r\n\r\n_January 16._--But for the truly enlightened and patriotic efforts\r\nof the Senators Wade, Lane, (of Kansas) and Trumbull, the debate of\r\nyesterday, Thursday, on the appropriation for the West Point\r\nMilitary Academy would have gone to the country, absolutely\r\nmisleading and stultifying the noble and enlightened people. It was\r\nmost sorrowful, nay, wholly disgusting to witness how Senators who,\r\nuntil then, had stood firmly against small influences and narrow\r\nprejudices, blended together in an unholy alliance to sustain the\r\naccursed clique of West Point engineers. Much allowance is to be\r\nmade for the allied Senators' ignorance of the matter, and for the\r\nnatural wish to appear wise. The country, the people, ought to\r\ntreasure the names of the ten patriotic Senators whose voices\r\nprotested against further sustaining that cursed nursery of\r\narrogance, of pro-slavery, or of something worse.\r\n\r\nWhatever might have been the efforts of the Senatorial patrons and\r\nthe allies of the engineers, the following facts remained for ever\r\nunalterable: 1st. That the spirit of close educational corporation\r\nwhich have exclusive monopoly and patronage, is perfectly similar to\r\nthe spirit which prevailed and still prevails in monasteries, and\r\npermeates the pupils during their whole after life; 2d. That the\r\nprevailing spirit in West Point was and is rather monarchical and\r\naltogether Pro-Slavery; 3d, that of course some noble exceptions\r\nare to be found and made,--but they are exceptions; 4th, that such\r\neducational monasteries nurse conceit and arrogance; and this the\r\nmass of West Pointers have prominently shown during this war in\r\ntheir relations with the noble and devoted volunteers, and that this\r\narrogant spirit of clique and of caste works mischievously in the\r\narmy; 5th, that exceptions, noble and patriotic, as a Reno, a Lyons,\r\na Bayard, a Stevens, and other such heroes and patriots, do not\r\ndisprove the general rule; 6th, that Lyons, Grant, Rosecrans,\r\nHooker, Heintzelman, etc., have shown glorious qualities not on\r\naccount of what they learnt in West Point, but by what they did not\r\nlearn there; 7th, that these heroes rose above the dry and narrow\r\nschool wisdom, and are what they are, not because educated in West\r\nPoint, but notwithstanding their education there. And here I\r\ninterrupt the further enumeration to give an extract from a private\r\nletter directed to me by one of the most eminent pupils from West\r\nPoint, and the ablest _true_, not _mock_, engineer in our army:\r\n\r\n     \"In regard to your views of West Point's influence I am at a loss\r\n     to make any answer,\" (the writer is a great defender of West\r\n     Point,) \"but would suggest that it may be after all not West\r\n     Point, but the want of _a supreme hand_ to our military affairs\r\n     to _combine_ and _use_ the materials West Point furnishes, that\r\n     is in fault. * * * _West Point cannot make a general_--no\r\n     military school can--but it can and does furnish good soldiers.\r\n     All the distinguished Confederate generals are West Pointers, and\r\n     yet we know the men, and know that neither Lee, nor Johnson nor\r\n     Jackson, nor Beauregard, nor the Hills are men of any very\r\n     extraordinary ability,\" etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\nTo this I answer: the rebels are with their heart and soul in their\r\ncause, and thus their capacities are expanded, they are inspired on\r\nthe field of battle. (Similar answer I gave to General McDowell\r\nabout six months ago.) So was our Lyon, so are Rosecrans, Hooker,\r\nGrant, and a few others; and for such generals, Senators Trumbull,\r\nWade and Lane ardently called in the above debate.\r\n\r\nI continue the enumeration: 8th. The military direction of the war is\r\nexclusively in the hands of a West Point clique, and of West Point\r\nengineers,--not _very much_ with their hearts in the people's cause;\r\n9th, that that clique of West Point engineers from McClellan down to\r\nHalleck prevents any truly higher military capacity getting a free\r\nuntrammelled scope, (General Halleck with all his might opposes giving\r\nthe command of the army to Hooker,) and this Halleck, an engineer from\r\nWest Point, who never saw a cartridge burnt or a file of soldiers\r\nfighting, to-day decides the military fate of our country on the\r\nauthority of a book said to be on military science, but if such a book\r\nhad been written by any officer in the armies of France, Prussia or\r\nRussia, the ignorant author would have had the friendly advice from\r\nhis superiors to resign and select some pursuit in life more congenial\r\nto his intellectual capacities; further, this Halleck complains in\r\nfollowing words: \"that they (the Administration) made him leave a\r\nprofitable business in San Francisco, and pay him only 5,000 dollars\r\nto fight THEIR (not his) battles.\" So much for a Halleck. 10th. That\r\nthe West Point clique of engineers, the McClellans, the Hallecks, the\r\nFranklins, etc., have brought the country to the verge of the grave,\r\nas stated by Senator Lane.\r\n\r\nSuch were the facts established by the patriotic and not\r\nwould-be-wise Senators; and there is an illustration recorded in\r\nhistory as proof that the above not engineering Senators were right\r\nin their assertions. Frederick II. was in no military school; the\r\ncaptains second to Napoleon in the French wars were Hoche, Moreau,\r\nand Massena, all of them from private life.\r\n\r\n--The clique of engineers has the Potomac Army altogether in its\r\ngrasp, and has reduced and perverted the spirit of the noble\r\nchildren of the people. Oh, the sooner this army shall be torn from\r\nthe hands of the clique the nearer and surer will be the salvation\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nThe clique accuses the volunteers; but the clique, the engineers in\r\npower have disorganized, morally and materially, and disgraced the\r\nArmy of the Potomac. They did this from the day of the encampments\r\naround Washington, in the fall of 1861, down to the day of\r\nFredericksburgh. Fredericksburgh was altogether prepared by\r\nengineers; at Fredericksburgh the engineer Franklin did not even\r\nmount his horse when his soldiers were misled and miscommanded--by\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n--Stragglers are generated by generals. Besides, to explain\r\nstraggling, I quote from a _genuine_ book on genuine military\r\nscience, published in Berlin in 1862, by Captain Boehn, the most\r\neminent professor at the military school in Potsdam: \"The greatest\r\nlosses, during a war, inflicted on an army are by maladies and by\r\nstraggling. Such losses are five times greater than those of killed\r\nand wounded; and an _intelligent administration_ takes preparatory\r\nmeasures to meet the losses and to compensate them. Such measures of\r\nforesight consist in organizing depots for battalions, which depots\r\nought to equal one sixth of the number of the active army.\" O,\r\nHalleck, where are the depots?\r\n\r\n--\"In any ordinary campaign, excepting a winter campaign, the losses\r\namount (as established by experience) to one half in infantry, one\r\nfourth in cavalry, and to one third in artillery.\" (Do you know any\r\nthing about it, O, Halleck?)\r\n\r\nLet the people be warned, and they may understand the location of\r\nthe cause generating further disasters. If the Army of the Potomac\r\nshall win glory, it will win it notwithstanding the West Point\r\nclique of engineers. The disasters have root in the White House,\r\nwhere the advice of such a Halleck prevails.\r\n\r\n--I know very well that the formation of the volunteers in\r\nrespective States and by the Governors of such States raises a great\r\ndifficulty in organizing and preparing reserves. But talent and\r\ngenius reveal themselves by overpowering difficulties considered to\r\nbe insurmountable. And Halleck is a man both of genius and talent.\r\n\r\nTaking into account the patriotism, the devotion of the governors of\r\nthe respective states, [not _à la_ Copperhead Seymour], it would\r\nhave been possible, nay, even easy to organize some kind of\r\nreserves. O, Halleck, O, fogies!\r\n\r\n_January 17._--Mr. Lincoln loads on his shoulders all kinds of\r\nresponsibilities, more so than even Jackson would have dared to\r\ntake. Admirable if generated by the boldness of self-consciousness,\r\nof faith, and of convictions. True men measure the danger--and the\r\nmeans in their grasp to meet the emergency; others play\r\nunconsciously with events, as do children with explosive and\r\ndeath-dealing matters.\r\n\r\n_January 17._--General and astronomer Mitchel's death may be credited\r\nto Halleck. Halleck and Buell's envy--if not worse--paralysed Mitchel\r\nand Turtschin's activity in the West. Mitchel and Turtschin were too\r\nquick, that is, too patriotic. In early summer, 1862, they were sure\r\nto take Chattanooga, a genuine strategic point, one of those principal\r\nknots and nurseries in the life of the secesh. How imprudent!\r\nChattanooga is still in the hands of the rebels, and if we ever take\r\nit, it will cost streams of blood and millions of money. Down with\r\nMitchel and Turtschin. Mitchel's _excrementa_ were more valuable than\r\nare Halleck's heavy, but not expanding, brains. Mitchel revealed at\r\nonce all the qualities of an eminent, if not of a great general.\r\nQuickness of mind, fertility of resources. An astronomer, a\r\nmathematician, Mitchel's mind was familiar with broad combinations.\r\nSuch a mind penetrated space, calculated means and chances, balanced\r\nforces and probabilities. Not to compare, however, is it to be borne\r\nin mind that Napoleon was a mathematician in the fullest sense, and\r\nnot an engineer, not a translator.\r\n\r\n_January 18._--Mr. Lincoln's letter to McClellan when the hero of\r\nthe Copperheads was in search of mud in the Peninsula. The letter\r\nrings as sound common sense; it shows, however, that common sense\r\ndebarred of strong will remains unproductive of good. Mr. Lincoln\r\ncommonly shows strong will, in the wrong place.\r\n\r\n  ----ein Theil von jener Krafft,\r\n  Die stehts das Guthe will, und stehts das Boese schaff.\r\n\r\n_January 18._--The emancipation proclamation is out. Very well. But\r\nuntil yet not the slightest signs of any measures to execute the\r\nproclamation, at once, and in its broadest sense. Now days, even\r\nhours, are equal to years in common times. Had Lincoln his heart in\r\nthe proclamation, on January 2d he would begin to work out its\r\nexpansion, realization, execution. I wish Lincoln may lift himself,\r\nor be lifted by angels to the grandeur of the work. But it is\r\nimpossible. Surrounded as he is, and led in the strings by Seward,\r\nBlair, Halleck, and by border-state politicians, the best that can\r\nbe expected are belated half measures.\r\n\r\nStanton comprehends broadly and thoroughly the question of\r\nemancipation and of arming the Africo-Americans. As I intend to\r\nrealize my plans of last year and organise Africo-American\r\nregiments, I had conversations with Stanton, and find him more\r\nthorough about the matter than is any body whom I met. He agreed\r\nwith me, that the cursed land of Secessia ought to be surrounded by\r\ncamps to enlist and organise the enslaved, as a scorpion surrounded\r\nwith burning coals. Such organizations introduced rapidly and\r\nsimultaneously on all points, would shake Secessia to its\r\nfoundations, and put an end to guerillas, _alias_ murderers and\r\nrobbers. We will again think and talk it over. But as is wont with\r\nLincoln, he will hesitate, hesitate, until much of precious time\r\nwill be lost.\r\n\r\n_January 18._--A surgeon in one of the hospitals in Alexandria\r\nwrites in a private note:\r\n\r\n     \"Our wounded bear their sufferings nobly; I have hardly heard a\r\n     word of complaint from one of them. A soldier from the 'stern and\r\n     rock bound coast' of Maine--a victim of the slaughter at\r\n     Fredericksburgh--lay in this hospital, his life ebbing away from\r\n     a fatal wound. He had a father, brothers and sisters, a wife, and\r\n     one little boy of two or three years old, on whom his heart\r\n     seemed set. Half an hour before he ceased to breathe, I stood by\r\n     his side, holding his hand. He was in the full exercise of his\r\n     intellectual faculties, and knew he had but a brief time to live.\r\n     He was asked if he had any message to leave for his dear ones\r\n     whom he loved so well. \"_Tell them_,\" said he, \"_how I died--they\r\n     know how I lived!_\"\r\n\r\n_January 19._--Senator Wright, of Indiana, stirred the hearts of the\r\nSenate and of the people. It was not the oration of a rhetor--it was\r\nthe confession of an ardent, pure patriot. I never heard or\r\nwitnessed anything so inspiring and so kindling to soul and heart.\r\n\r\n_January 20._--General Butler palsied and shelved, Halleck all\r\npowerful and with full steam running the country and the army to\r\ndestruction--such is the truest photograph of the situation. But as\r\nan adamantine rock among storms, so Mr. Lincoln remains unmoved.\r\nUnmoved by the yawning, bleeding wounds of the devoted, noble\r\npeople--unmoved by the prayers and supplication of patriots--of\r\nhis--once--best friends. Mr. Lincoln answers, with dignity not\r\nRoman, and with obstinacy unparallelled even by Jackson, that he\r\nwill stand or fall with his present advisers, and that he takes the\r\nresponsibility for all the cursed misdeeds of Seward, Halleck,\r\nChase, and others. So children are ready to set a match to a powder\r\nmagazine unconscious of the terrible results--unconscious of the\r\nawful responsibility for its destructive action.\r\n\r\nA death pang runs through one's body to see how rapidly the dial\r\nmarks the disappearing hours, and how unrelentingly approaches March\r\n4th, and the death-knell of this present patriotic, devoted\r\nCongress. For this terrible storm and clash of events, the people,\r\nperhaps, feel not the immensity of the loss. Paralyzed as Congress\r\nhas been and now is, by the infernal machinations of Seward, Chase,\r\nand others, and by Mr. Lincoln's stubborn helplessness, the patriots\r\nin both Houses nevertheless, succeeded in redeeming the pledge which\r\nthe name of America gives to the expansive progress of humanity. The\r\npatriots of both Houses, as the exponents of the noble and loftiest\r\naspirations of the American people, whipped in--and this literally,\r\nnot figuratively--whipped Mr. Lincoln into the glory of having\r\nissued the Emancipation Proclamation. The laws promulgated by this\r\ndying Congress initiated the Emancipation--generated the\r\nProclamation of the 22d September, and of January 1st. History will\r\nnot allow one to wear borrowed plumage.\r\n\r\n--Congress ought not to have so easily abdicated its well established\r\nrights of more absolute and direct control of the deeds of the\r\nAdministration and of its clerks, _alias_ Secretaries of Departments.\r\nIt is to be eternally regretted that Congress has shown such\r\nunnecessary leniency; but in justice it must be said that the\r\npatriotic and high-minded members of Congress wished to avoid the\r\ndegrading necessity of showing the nation the prurient administrative\r\nsores. Advised, directed, tutored and pushed by Seward, Blair and\r\nChase, Mr. Lincoln is--innocently--as grasping for power, as are any\r\nof those despots not over respectfully recorded by history.\r\n\r\nWith all this, the presence of Congress keeps in awe the reckless\r\nand unscrupulous Administration, as, according to the pious belief\r\nof medieval times, holy water awed the devil. But Congress once out\r\nof the way, without having succeeded in rescuing Mr. Lincoln from\r\nthe hands of those mean, ignorant, egotistic bunglers, all the time\r\nsquinting towards the succession to the White House, and unable to\r\nsurround the President with men and patriots, then all the plagues\r\nof Egypt may easily overrun this fated country. Such conjurors of\r\nevil as the Sewards, Hallecks, and others, will have no dread of any\r\nholy water before them, and they will be sure that the great party\r\nof the \"Copperheads\" in the future Congress will applaud them for\r\nall the mischief done, and lift them sky high, if they succeed in\r\ntreading down in the gutter, or in any way palsying emancipation,\r\ntarnishing the people's noble creed, and endangering the country's\r\nholiest cause.\r\n\r\nGeneral Fitz-John Porter's trial before court-martial ended in his\r\ndismissal, but ought punishment to fall on him alone, when the\r\nbutchers of Fredericksburgh and when the pontoon men are in high\r\ncommand? when a Franklin is still sustained, when a Seward and a\r\nHalleck remain firm in their high places as the gates of hell?\r\n\r\n_January 20._--Wrote a respectful letter to the President on\r\nHalleck's military science, his book, and capacity. Told\r\nrespectfully to Mr. Lincoln that not even the Sultan would dare to\r\npalm such a Halleck on his army and on his people.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln in his greatness says that \"he will stand and fall with\r\nhis Cabinet.\" O, Mr. Lincoln! O, Mr. Lincoln! purple-born sovereigns\r\ncan no more speak so!\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln! with the gang of politicians, your advisers and\r\nfriends, _you all desire immensely, and will feebly_. You desire the\r\nreconstruction of the Union, and you almost shun the ways and means\r\nto do it. And thus this noble people is dragged to a slaughter\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n  Parumne campis atque Neptuno super\r\n  Fusum est--[Yankee] sanguinis?\r\n\r\n_January 21._--Deep, irreconcilable as is my hatred of slavocrats\r\nand rebels, nevertheless I am forced to admire the high intellectual\r\nqualities of their chiefs, when compared with that of ours. Of\r\nLincoln _versus_ Jeff Davis I spoke in the first volume. But now\r\nLee, Jackson, Hill, Ewall, _versus_ Halleck, McClellan, McDowell,\r\nFranklin, etc.\r\n\r\n_January 22._--Wendell Phillips's _Amen_ oration to the Proclamation\r\nis noble and torrent-like oratory. Greeley is the better Greeley of\r\nformer times. I heartily wish to admire and speak well of Greeley,\r\nas of every body else. Is it my fault that they give me no occasion?\r\n\r\n_January 23._--General Fitz-John Porter, McClellan's pet, told me\r\nto-day, that after the battle at Hanover Court House, he supplicated\r\nMcClellan to attack Richmond at once--which in Porter's opinion\r\ncould have been taken without much ado,--and not to change his base\r\nto James River; and even Fitz-John could not prevail on this demigod\r\nof imbeciles, traitors and intriguers.\r\n\r\n_January 24._--Here is one of the thousand flagrant lies with which\r\nSeward entangles Lincoln, as with a net of steel. Lincoln assured\r\nGeneral Ashley that the public is unjust toward Seward in accusing\r\nhim of having worked for the defeat of Wadsworth. That they have\r\nbeen the best friends for long years; that, when Military Governor\r\nof Washington, Wadsworth was a daily visitor in Seward's house; and\r\nthat, during the canvass, Wadsworth consulted with Seward concerning\r\nhis (Wadsworth's) actions.\r\n\r\nMr. Seward knows that every one of those assertions which he or\r\nThurlow Weed pushed down the throat of Mr. Lincoln is a flagrant\r\nlie. Every one knows that for many, many years the high-toned\r\nWadsworth had in utter detestation Mr. Seward's character as a\r\nlawyer or as a public man, and that he never spoke to him, and never\r\nwas his political or private friend.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to bring such details before the public, but how\r\notherwise convict a liar? As for Thurlow Weed's secret and open\r\nmachinations against the election of Wadsworth, only an idiot or a\r\ns.... doubts them. Ask the New York politicians, provided they have\r\nmanhood to tell the truth.\r\n\r\n_January 24th._--_Caveant Senators and Representatives!_ cannot be\r\ntoo often hurled into the ears of the people and of the Congressmen.\r\nThe time runs lightning like--the 4th of March approaches with\r\ncomet-like velocity. If the tempest is not roaring, its signs are\r\nvisible, and most of the helmsmen are blind or unsteady. Oh! could\r\nevery move of the pendulums of the clocks of the Senate Chamber and\r\nthe Representatives' Hall, thunder-like repeat that _caveant_,\r\ntransmitted by the purest and best days of Rome! The Republicans and\r\nmany of the war Democrats are faithful and true to the people and to\r\nits sacred cause; but the names of the \"filibustering\" traitors in\r\nboth houses ought to be nailed to the gallows!\r\n\r\nEuropean winds bring Louis Napoleon's opening speech, and the\r\nconfession, that although once rebuked, he, the dissolute, the\r\nprofligate, with his corrosive breath still intends to pollute the\r\nvirginity of our country; for such is the indelible stain to any\r\nnation, to any people which accepts or submits to any, even the most\r\nfriendly, foreign mediation or arbitration. Never, never any great\r\nnation or any self-respecting government, accepted or submitted to\r\nany similar foreign interference. Of the peoples, nations and\r\ngovernments, which allowed such interference, some collapsed into\r\ndegradation for a long time, only slowly recovering, like Spain;\r\nothers, like Poland, disappeared. Those who advocate such mediation\r\nunveil their weakness, their thorough ignorance of the world's\r\nhistory and of the historic and political bearings of the words,\r\n_mediation_, and _arbitration_; and to crown all, these advocates\r\nbring to market their imbecility.\r\n\r\nThe Africo-Americans ought to receive military organization and be\r\narmed. But it ought to be done instantly and without loss of time;\r\nit ought to be done earnestly, boldly, broadly; it ought to be done\r\nat once on all points and on the largest scale; it ought to be done\r\nhere in Washington, under the eyes of the chief of the people; here\r\nin the heart of the country; here, so to speak, in the face of\r\nslave-breeding Virginia, this most intense focus of treason; it\r\nought to be done here, that the loyal freemen of Virginia's soil be\r\nenabled to fight and crush the F. F. V's, the progeny of hell; it\r\nought to be done here on every inch of soil covered with shattered\r\nshackles; and not partially on the outskirts, in the Carolinas and\r\nLouisiana. Stanton, alone, and Welles among the helmsmen, are so\r\ninspired; but alas, for the rest of the crew.\r\n\r\nOn the flags of the Africo-Americans under my command, I shall\r\ninscribe: _Hic niger est! hunc tu (rebel) caveto!_ I shall inculcate\r\nupon my men that they had better not make prisoners in the battle,\r\nand not allow themselves to be taken alive.\r\n\r\n_January 25th._--So Gen. McClellan's services to the rebellion are\r\nacknowledged by the gift of a splendid mansion situated in New York,\r\nin the social sewer of American society. The donors, are the shavers\r\nfrom Wall Street, individuals who coin money from the blood and from\r\nthe misfortunes of the people, and who by high rents mercilessly\r\ncrush the poor; who sacrifice nothing for the sacred cause; who, if\r\nthey put their names as voluntary contributors of a trifle for the\r\nwar, thousand and thousand times recover that trifle which they\r\nostentatiously throw to gull the good-natured public opinion; not to\r\nspeak of those so numerous among the McClellanites, who openly or\r\nsecretly are in mental communion with treason and rebellion.\r\nNaturally, all this gang honors its hero.\r\n\r\nMcClellan's pedestal is already built of the corpses of hundreds of\r\nthousands butchered by his generalship, poisoned in the\r\nChickahominy, and decimated by diseases. His trophies are the wooden\r\nguns from Centreville and Manassas.\r\n\r\n_January 25th._--What from the beginning of this war, I witness as\r\nadministrative acts and dispositions, and further the debates in\r\nCongress on the various bills for military organizations and for the\r\norganization of the various branches of the military medical,\r\nsurgical, and quartermaster's service; all this fully convinces me\r\nthat the military and administrative routine, as transmitted by Gen.\r\nScott, or by his school, and as continued by his pets and remnants,\r\nis almost the paramount cause of all mischief and evils. In the\r\nmedical, surgical, and in the quartermasters' offices, ought have\r\nbeen appointed young civilians and business men as chiefs, having\r\nunder them some old routinists for the sake of technicalities of the\r\nservice. Such men would have done by far better than those old\r\nintellectual drones. A merchant accustomed to carry on an extensive\r\nand complicated business would have been by far a better\r\nquartermaster-general--_Intendant des armées_--than the wholly\r\ninexperienced Gen. Meigs. This last would serve as an aid to the\r\nmerchant. At the beginning of the war, I suggested to Senator Wilson\r\nto import such quartermasters from France or Russia, men experienced\r\nand accustomed to provide for armies of 100,000 men each. By paying\r\nwell, such men could have been easily found, and the military\r\nmedical and surgical bureau, as organized by Scott, was about sixty\r\nyears behind real science. These senile representatives of\r\nnon-science snubbed off Professor Van Buren of the New York\r\nacademy, to whom they compare as the light of a common match to that\r\nof calcium. If men like Dr. Van Buren, Dr. Barker, and others of\r\nreal science from New York, Boston, Philadelphia, etc., had been\r\nlistened to, thousands and thousands of limbs and lives would have\r\nbeen saved and preserved.\r\n\r\n_January 25th._--Mr. Lincoln relishes the idea that if the cause of\r\nthe North is victorious, no one can claim much credit for it. I put\r\nthis on record for some future assumptions. Mr. Lincoln is the best\r\njudge of the merits of his clerks and lieutenants. But Mr. Lincoln\r\nforgets that the success will be due exclusively to the people--and,\r\n_per contra_, he alone will be arrayed for the failure. His friends\r\nand advisers, as the Sewards, the Weeds, the Blairs, the Hallecks,\r\nwill very cleverly wash their gored hands from any complicity with\r\nhim--Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe army to be formed from Africo-Americans is to be entrusted to\r\nconverted conservatives. It is feared that sincere abolitionists if\r\nentrusted with the command, may use the forces for some awful,\r\nuntold aims. It is feared that abolitionists once possessed of arms\r\nand troops, may use them indiscriminately, and emancipate right and\r\nleft, by friend and foe, paying no attention to the shrieks of\r\nborder-States, of old women, of politicians, of cowards, of\r\nSewardites; nay, it is feared that genuine abolitionists may carry\r\ntoo far their notions of absolute equality of races, and without\r\nhesitation treat the white rebels with even more severity than they\r\nthreaten to treat loyal armed Africo-Americans. And why not?...\r\n\r\nThe history of England, the history of any free country has not on\r\nrecord a position thus anomalous, even humiliating, as is that of\r\nthe patriots in Congress, thanks to Mr. Lincoln's helpless\r\nstubbornness. The patriots forcibly must consider Mr. Lincoln, even\r\nSewardised, Blairised, Halleckised as he is, as being the only legal\r\npower for the salvation of the country. The patriots must support\r\nhim, and instead of exposing the wretched faults, mistakes, often\r\nill-will of his administration, must defend the administration\r\nagainst the attacks of the Copperheads, who try to destroy or\r\ndisorganize the administration on account of that atom of good that\r\nit accidentally carries out on its own hook. And thus the patriots\r\nmust suffer and bear patiently abuses heaped on them by the\r\ntreasonable or by the stupid press, by intriguers and traitors; and\r\npatriots cannot make even the slightest attempt to vindicate their\r\nnames.\r\n\r\n_January 26th._--The visits to the White House and the \"_I had a\r\ntalk with the President_,\" are among the prominent causes of the\r\ndistracted condition of affairs. With comparatively few exceptions,\r\nalmost everybody expands a few inches in his own estimation, when he\r\nsays to his listeners, nay, to his friends: \"I had a talk with the\r\nPresident.\" Of course it is no harm in private individuals to have\r\nsuch _a talk_, but I have frequently observed and experienced that\r\npublic men had better refrain from having any talk with him. Very\r\noften he is not a jot improved by their talk, and they come out from\r\nthe interview worsted in some sort or other.\r\n\r\nSumner, the Roman, the Cicero, was to-day urged by several\r\nabolitionists from Boston to expose the mischief of both the foreign\r\nand the domestic policy of Seward. The Senator replied that he is\r\nmore certain to succeed against that public nuisance and public\r\nenemy by not attacking him openly. I vainly ransack my recollection\r\nof my classic reading for the name of any Roman who ever made such a\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n_January 26th: Two o'clock P. M._--Hooker is in command! And\r\npatriotic hearts thrill with joy! Mud, bad season, mortality, loss\r\nof time, demoralization, such is the inheritance left by McClellan,\r\nHalleck and Burnside--such are the results prepared by the infamous\r\nWest Point and other muddy intriguers in Washington, and in the\r\narmy,--such is the inheritance transmitted to Hooker, by the cursed\r\nAdministration procrastinations. In all military history there is\r\nseldom, if ever, a record of a commander receiving an army under\r\nsuch ominous circumstances. If Hooker succeeds, then his genius will\r\nastonish even his warmest friends.\r\n\r\nWhen Hooker was wounded, and in the hospital, he repeatedly\r\ncomplained to me of the deficiency of the staffs. I reminded him of\r\nit, and he promised to do his best to organize a staff without a\r\nflaw.\r\n\r\nI immediately wrote to Stanton, sending him several pages translated\r\nfrom the German works of Boehn (before spoken of) to give to the\r\nSecretary a general idea of what are the qualities, the science, the\r\nknowledge and the duties of a good chief of staff. I explained that\r\nthe staff and the chief of the staff of an army are to it what the\r\nbrains and the nervous system are to the human body.\r\n\r\n_9 o'clock, P. M._--I am told that Hooker wished to have for his\r\nchief of staff General Stone, (white-washed) who is considered to be\r\none of the most brilliant capacities of the army. If so, it was a\r\ngood choice, and the opposition made by Stanton is for me--at the\r\nbest--unintelligible.\r\n\r\nHooker selected Butterfield. What a fall from Stone to Butterfield.\r\nBetween the two extend hundreds, nay, thousands, of various\r\ngradations. Gen. Butterfield is brave, can well organize a regiment\r\nor a brigade, but he has not and can not have the first atom of\r\nknowledge required in a chief of staff of such a large army. Staff\r\nduties require special studies, they are the highest military\r\nscience; and where, in the name of all, could Butterfield have\r\nacquired it? I am certain Butterfield is not even aware that staff\r\nduties are a special science. All this is a very bad omen, very bad,\r\nvery bad. Literally they laugh at me; now they hurrah for Hooker.\r\nMay they not cry very soon on account of Hooker's staff. When I\r\nwarn, Senators and Representatives tell me that I am very difficult\r\nto be satisfied. We will see.\r\n\r\n_January 27._--It is said that Franklin, Sumner, and even\r\nHeintzelman declared they would not serve under Hooker. Let them go.\r\nBow them out, the hole in the army will be invisible. I am sorry\r\nthat Heintzelman plays such pranks, as he is a very good general and\r\na very good man. Well, a new galaxy of generals and commanders is\r\nthe inevitable gestation of every war. Seldom if ever the same men\r\nend a war who began it. New men will prove better than the present\r\nsickly reputations consecrated by Scott, West Point and Washington.\r\n\r\n_January 27._--Governor Andrew--the man always to the point, or as the\r\nFrench would say _toujours à la hauteur de la question_--insists on\r\nforming African or black regiments in Boston from free blacks. Such\r\nformations interfere not with my project, as I principally, nay\r\nexclusively, look to contrabands, to actual slaves. Governor Andrew\r\nwishes to give the start, to stir up the Government and other\r\nGovernors and to drag them in his footsteps. He is the representative\r\nman of the new and better generation which ought to have the affairs\r\nof the country in hand, and not these old worn-out hacks who are at it\r\nnow. If such new men were at the helm in both civil and military\r\naffairs, Secesh would have been already crushed and Emancipation\r\naccomplished. To such a new generation belongs Coffey, one of the\r\nAssistant Attorney Generals, Austin Stevens, Jr., Charles Dana,\r\nWoodman, etc., etc. The country bristles with such men, and only\r\nprejudices, stupidity, and routine prevents them from becoming really\r\nactive and from saving the country.\r\n\r\n_January 27._--The patriotic majorities of both Houses of Congress\r\npass laws after laws concerning the finances, arming the\r\nAfrico-Americans, increasing the powers of the President, etc., each\r\nof which taken alone, would not only save the cause but raise it\r\ntriumphant over the ruins of crime and of slavery, if used by\r\npatriotic, firm, devoted, unegotistic hands and brains. But alas!\r\nalas! very little of such, except in one or two individuals, is\r\nlocated in the various edifices in and around the presidential\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nThe military organization of Africo-Americans is a powerful social\r\nand military engine by which slavery, secession, rebellion, and all\r\nother dark and criminal Northern and Southern excrescences can be\r\ncrushed and pulverized to atoms, and this in a trice. But as is the\r\ncase with all other powerful and explosive gases, elements, forces,\r\netc. this mighty element put in the hands of the Administration must\r\nbe handled resolutely, and with unquivering hands and intellect;\r\notherwise the explosion may turn out useless for the country and for\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nAt present the indications are very small that the administration\r\nhas a decided, clear comprehension how to use this accession of\r\nloyal forces on a large scale; how to bring them boldly into action\r\nin Virginia, as the heart of the rebellion. Nothing yet indicates\r\nthat the administration intends to arm and equip Africo-Americans\r\nhere under the eyes of the government. Nothing indicates that it\r\nintends to do this avowedly and openly, and thereby terrify and\r\nstrike the proud slave-breeders, the F. F. V's. of Virginia, in the\r\nheart of treason, and do it by their own once chattels, now their\r\nbetters.\r\n\r\n_January 28._--The Congress almost expires; and will or can the\r\nincarnated constitutional formula save the country? It is a chilling\r\nthought to doubt, yet how can we have confidence! All in the\r\npeople! the people alone and its true men will not and cannot\r\nfail, and they alone are up to the mission.\r\n\r\nThe dying Congress can no more reconquer its abdicated power. This\r\nnoble and patriotic majority--many of them, are not re-elected,\r\nthanks to Lincoln-Seward--provide the incarnate formula with all\r\nimaginable legal, constitutional powers, more than twice sufficient\r\nto save the country. Could only the brains and hands entrusted with\r\nlaws, be able to execute them! Oh for a legal, constitutional,\r\nstatute Cromwell, ready to behead treason, rebellion, slavocracy and\r\nslavo-sympathy, as the great Oliver beheaded and crushed the\r\npoisonous weeds of his time. If the democratic-copperhead vermin\r\nhad the possibility, they would make a McClellan-Seymour\r\ndictatorship, and extinguish for a century at least, light, right,\r\njustice, and freedom. Not yet! Oh, Copperheads! not yet.\r\n\r\n_January 29._--They dance to madness in New York, they dance here\r\nand give dancing parties! O what a heartlessness, recklessness,\r\nflippancy, and crime, of those mothers, wives and young crinolines,\r\nwhen one half of the population is already in mourning, when they\r\nhave fathers, brothers, husbands in the army. I hope that Boston and\r\nNew England as well as the towns and villages of the country all\r\nover, spit on this example given by New York and Washington. My\r\nfriend N----, progressive, enlightened and therefore a true Russian,\r\nis amazed and displeased with such an intolerable flippancy. During\r\nthe Crimean war, no one danced in Russia from the Imperial palace\r\ndown to the remotest village; the people's indignation would have\r\nprevented any body--even the Czar, from such a sacrilegious display\r\nof recklessness when the country's integrity and honor were at\r\nstake, when the nation's blood was pouring in torrents.\r\n\r\nUnspeakably worse, is the cold indifference with which many\r\ngenerals, many men in power, the rhetors and the politicians, speak\r\nof what is more than a sacrifice in a sacred cause, is an unholy and\r\ndemoniac waste of human life. But some one--some avenging angel,\r\nwill call them all to a terrible account.\r\n\r\n_January 30._--I would have ex-Governor Boutwell, of Massachusetts,\r\nSecretary of State. The conduct of European affairs requires pure\r\npatriotism--that is, conscientiousness of being an American by\r\nprinciple, in the noblest philosophical sense, sound common sense,\r\ndiscretion, simplicity, sobriety of mind, firmness, clear-sightedness.\r\nBoutwell would be a Secretary of State similar to Marcy.\r\n\r\n_January 30._--Wrote a letter to Stanton with the following\r\nsuggestions for the organization of a large and efficacious force,\r\nnay, army, from the Africo-Americans.\r\n\r\nSome of the points submitted to this genuine patriot have been\r\nalready variously mentioned above; here are some others.\r\n\r\n1. It may be possible--even probable--on account of inveterate\r\nprejudices and stupidity, that an Africo-American regiment may be\r\nleft unsupported during a battle.\r\n\r\n2. It would be therefore more available to organize such a force at\r\nonce on a large scale, so as to be able to have strong brigades, and\r\neven divisions. At the head of six to eight thousand men, resistance\r\nis possible for several hours if the enemy outnumbers not in too\r\ngreat proportions--four or five to one, and if the terrain is not\r\naltogether against the smaller force.\r\n\r\n3. The Africo-Americans ought to be formed, drilled and armed\r\nprincipally with the view to constitute light infantry--and, if\r\npossible, light cavalry--but above all, for a _set fight_.\r\n\r\n4. Their dress must be adapted to such a light service--as ought to\r\nbe the dress of our whole infantry, facilitating to the utmost the\r\nquick and easy movements of the body and of the feet; both\r\nimpossible or at least difficult in the present equipment of the\r\nAmerican infantry. On account of the modern improvements in fire\r\narms, the fights begin at longer distances, and it is important that\r\nthe soldier be trained to march as quickly as possible, so as to\r\nforce the enemy from their positions at the point of the bayonet. In\r\nthis country of clay, bad roads, forests and underbrush, even more\r\nthan care must be bestowed upon the feet and legs of the infantry. I\r\nsuggested an imitation of the equipment of the French infantry.\r\n\r\n5. In the case of the arsenals not having the requisite number of\r\nfire-arms, I would have the third line armed with scythes. As a\r\nPole, I am familiar with that really terrible weapon.\r\n\r\n6. To adapt the drill to the object in view--to free it as far as\r\npossible from needless technicalities, and to reduce it to the most\r\nurgently needed and the most readily comprehended particulars.\r\n\r\n7. In view of the above-mentioned reasons, I would have the Tactics\r\nnow in use very carefully revised, or have an entirely new book of\r\nTactics and Regulations.\r\n\r\n8. Suggested that General Casey should be entrusted with the matters\r\ntreated of in suggestions 6 and 7.\r\n\r\n_January 31._--The Copperheads in Congress are shedding crocodile\r\ntears over the doom that awaits those Africo-Americans who may\r\nunfortunately be taken prisoners by the rebels. Now, in the first\r\nplace enlisted Africo-Americans are under the protection of the\r\nUnited States Government, and that Government will not be guilty of\r\nthe infamy of seeing its captured soldiers murdered in cold\r\nblood--and in the next place the Africo-American will prove anything\r\nrather than an easily-made captive to Southern murderers. The\r\nAfrico-Americans will sell their lives so dearly as to disgust the\r\nrebels with the task of attempting to capture them.\r\n\r\n_January 31._--Few people can understand the intensity of the\r\ndisgust with which I find myself often obliged to mention Thurlow\r\nWeed--that darkest incarnation of all that is evil in black mail,\r\nlobbyism, and all hideous corruptions. It is not my fault that such\r\na man is allowed to exert a malign influence on the country's fate,\r\nand I am obliged to give the dark as well as the bright parts of the\r\ngreat social picture. How deeply I regret my inability to collect\r\nand record, in part at least, if not as a whole, all the deeds of\r\nheroism and devotion, of generous and brave self-abnegation, which\r\nhave been done by thousands, even by millions of those who are both\r\nfalsely and foolishly called the lower classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY, 1863.\r\n\r\n     The Problems before the People -- the Circassian -- Department of\r\n     State and International Laws -- Foresight -- Patriot Stanton and\r\n     the Rats -- Honest Conventions -- Sanitary Commission -- Harper's\r\n     Ferry -- John Brown -- the Yellow Book -- the Republican Party --\r\n     Epitaph -- Prize Courts -- Suum cuique -- Academy of Sciences --\r\n     Democratic Rank and File, etc. etc. etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 1._--The task which this great American people has on its\r\nhands is one utterly unexampled in the history of the world. While\r\nin the midst of a great civil war, and struggling as it were in very\r\ndeath-throes, to emancipate and organize four millions of men, most\r\nof whom, up to this very day, have by deliberate legislation been\r\nkept in ignorance and savagery. Thoroughly to comprehend the\r\nimmensity of such a task, we must also reflect that the men to whom\r\nthat task is intrusted are anything rather than intellectual\r\ngiants. Yet the true solution of the problem will be given by the\r\nprinciple of self-government and by the self-governing People. And\r\nit is therein that consists the genuine American originality which\r\nEurope finds it so impossible to understand. And it is just as\r\nlittle understood by most of the diplomatists here, and what\r\nis still worse, it is not even studied by them. It is wretched\r\nwork to be obliged to witness the low, the actually ignoble parts\r\nwhich many men play in the great farce of political life. I could\r\neasily mention a full score of would-be-eminent men, who are\r\nunsurpassed by the meanest of the vulgar herd in flippancy and an\r\nutter want of self-respect.\r\n\r\nThe diary published in London by Bull Run Russell deserves to be read\r\nby every American. Russell deals blows to slavery which will tell in\r\nEngland. However annoying may be to many the disclosures made by this\r\nindiscreet confidant of their vanity, Russell's revelations establish\r\nfirmly the broad historical--not gossipping--fact, that before and\r\nafter Sumter, the most absolute want of earnestness, of statesmanlike\r\nforesight, and the most childish but fathomless vanity inspired all\r\nthe actions of the American Secretary of State. I am one of the few\r\nwho, having often met Russell here, never fawned to him, nay who not\r\neven took any notice of him; but I am grateful to him for his\r\nfalsely-called indiscreetness--for his having done the utmost to bring\r\nout truth--in his own way. It is the best that I have seen, or heard,\r\nor read of him. Flatterers, Secretaries, Senators, and Generals\r\ncrowded to Russell and to his table, and he exposes them. Among\r\nothers, General McDowell was Russell's guest, very likely to show his\r\ngratitude to the slanderer of the volunteers, whom McDowell did not\r\nunderstand how to lead to victory.\r\n\r\nSeward showed to Russell his dispatches to Lord John Russell. Mr.\r\nSumner, at Bull Run Russell's table, asked Russell's aid to keep\r\npeace with England. Good! Unspeakably good!\r\n\r\nNot only the Emancipation problem must be solved, so to speak,\r\namidst the storm of battle--but other and very mighty problems,\r\nsocial, constitutional, jurisprudential, and financial, must be\r\nsimilarly and promptly dealt with. And these great questions must be\r\ndebated to the accompaniment of the music of musketry and cannon. In\r\nsome respects the situation of America at present may be said to\r\nresemble that of France in the days of her great Revolution. But\r\naffairs here and now are still more complicated than they were in\r\nFrance from 1789 to 1793.\r\n\r\nFormerly I took a more active part than I now take in revolutionary\r\nand reformatory struggles, and was seldom daunted by their difficult\r\nproblems, or by their most violent tempests. But now I have a\r\nchilling sense of weariness and disgust as I note the strange things\r\nthat are done under my very eyes.\r\n\r\nThe burden of taxes laid upon a people who have an inborn hatred of\r\ntaxation, a debt created in a few months surpassing that which\r\nEngland and France contracted in half a century; and that debt\r\ncontracted as if by magic, and in the very crisis of a civil\r\nwar such as any foreign war would be mere baby's play to.\r\n\r\nThe people at large see the precipice, and hear the roaring of the\r\nbreakers ahead, but despair not! Sublime phenomena for the future\r\nhistorian to dwell upon! All this is genuine American originality.\r\nIn its sublime presence, down, down upon your knees in the dust, all\r\nyou European wiseacres!\r\n\r\nThe capture of the _Circassian_, an English blockade runner, gave\r\nbirth to some very delicate international complications. The\r\ndecision of the Prize Court shows up the absolute destitution of\r\nstatesmanship in the Department of State, generally coruscated with\r\nignorance of international principles, rules of judicial\r\ninternational decisions, and of belligerent rights and observances.\r\nEvery day shows what a masterly stroke it was of the Secretary of\r\nState to have proclaimed the blockade in April, 1861, and to have\r\nbeen the first to recognize the rebels in the character of\r\nindependent belligerents. The more blockade runners will be captured\r\nby our cruisers, the more the complications will grow. A false first\r\nstep generates false conditions _ad infinitum_. The question of the\r\n_Circassian_ is only the beginning, and not even the worst. The\r\nworst will come by and by. But Seward is great before Allah! The\r\ntruth is, that Mr. Seward and the Department are as innocent of\r\nany familiarity with international laws, as can be. The people,\r\nthe intelligent people would be horror-stricken could they suddenly\r\nbe made acquainted with all the shameful ignorance which is\r\ncorrosively fermenting in the State Department.\r\n\r\nTo every intelligent and well regulated Government in Europe, the\r\nDepartment of Foreign Affairs--which in America is called the State\r\nDepartment--has attached to it a board of advisers for the solution\r\nof all international questions.\r\n\r\nIn England, for instance, all such questions are referred to the\r\nCrown Lawyers, i.e. the Attorney and Solicitor General, and, in\r\nspecially important cases, to the Lord High Chancellor, and one or\r\ntwo of the Judges. And in order to obtain the advice he obviously\r\nstands so much in need of, Mr. Seward ought to have consulted two or\r\nthree American juriconsults of eminence. Mr. Seward ought to have\r\nforeseen that the war would necessarily give rise to international,\r\ncommercial, and maritime complications. Such men as Charles Eames,\r\nUpton, etc. would have been excellent advisers on all international\r\nand statutory questions. Presumptuous that I am--to venture upon\r\nthe mere supposition that Seward the Great can possibly need advice!\r\nNot he, of course--not he. Mr. Seward is the Alpha and Omega--knows\r\neverything, and can do every thing himself. Happily, the people at\r\nlarge is the genuine statesman, and can correct the mistakes--and\r\nworse--of its blundering, bungling servants.\r\n\r\nAmerican pilots and statesmen! Forget not that foresight is the germ\r\nof action. Foresight reveals to the mind the opportuneness of the\r\nneeded measure by which a solution is to be given, a question\r\ndecided, and the hoped-for results obtained.\r\n\r\nAmerican people! How much foresight have your--dearly-paid--servants\r\nshown? You, the people alone, you have been far-seeing and\r\nprophetic; but not they.\r\n\r\n_February 2._--All the efforts of the worshippers of treason, of\r\ndarkness, of barbarism, of cruelty, and of infamy--all their\r\nmanoeuvres and menaces could not prevail. The majority of the\r\nCongress has decided that the powerful element of Africo-Americans\r\nis to be used on behalf of justice, of freedom, and of human rights.\r\nThe bill passed both the Houses. It is to be observed that the \"big\"\r\ndiplomats swallowed _col gusto_ all the pro-slavery speeches, and\r\nsnubbed off the patriotic ones. The noblest eulogy of the patriots!\r\n\r\nThe patriots may throb with joy! The President intends great changes\r\nin his policy, and has telegraphed for----Thurlow Weed, that prince\r\nof dregs, to get from him light about the condition of the country.\r\n\r\nThe conservative \"Copperheads\" of Boston and of other places in New\r\nEngland press as a baby to their bosom, and lift to worship\r\nMcClellan, the conservative, and all this out of deepest hatred\r\ntowards all that is noble, humane, and lofty in the genuine American\r\npeople. Well they may! If by his generalship McClellan butchered\r\nhundreds of thousands in the field, he was always very conservative\r\nof his precious little self.\r\n\r\nBiting snow storm all over Virginia! Our soldiers! our soldiers in\r\nthe camp! It is heart-rending to think of them. Conservative\r\nMcClellan so conservatively campaigned until last November as to\r\npreserve--the rebel armies, and make a terrible winter campaign an\r\ninevitable necessity. O, Copperheads and Boston conservatives! When\r\nyou bend your knees before McClellan, you dip them in the best and\r\npurest blood of the people!\r\n\r\n_February 3._--The Secretary of War appointed General Casey to\r\nshorten the general tactics for the use of Africo-American regiments\r\nto use them as light infantry.\r\n\r\nThe devotion of American women to the sick and wounded soldiers,\r\nmakes them be envied by the angels in Heaven (provided there are\r\nany). This devotion of these genuine gentlewomen atones for the\r\nignoble flippancy of dancing crinolines.\r\n\r\nDown, down goes slavery notwithstanding the _gates of hell_, and\r\ntheir guard, the McClellans, the Sewards, amorously embracing the\r\nCopperheads and all that is dark and criminal. Humanity is avenged\r\nand Eternal Justice is satisfied.\r\n\r\n_February 4._--Sumner is re-elected to the Senate. His re-election\r\nvindicates a sound principle, because his opponents were all the\r\nCopperheads and slavery-saviours in Massachusetts. Sumner's\r\ninfluence in the Senate is rather limited. Politically he is on all\r\npoints most honest; but his conduct towards Seward is not calculated\r\nto impress one with any very high esteem for his manhood.\r\n\r\nIt is not force, or decision, or power, that is cruel in\r\nrevolutionary times--but, weakness. All societies have had their\r\nepochs of progress and of retrogression. Sylla was a conservative,\r\nand so too was Phocion. The Pharisees were reactionists and\r\nconservatives. Europe has millions of them, of various hues, shapes,\r\ntendencies and convictions. But the reactionists and conservatives\r\nin the past of Europe all have been and are of a purer metal than\r\nthe conservatives here, and their impure organs, as the National\r\nIntelligencer, the World, the Boston Courier, and the rest of that\r\nfetish creed.\r\n\r\n_February 4._--The French Yellow Book, or State Correspondence,\r\njustifies my forebodings of November last. Mr. Mercier's diplomatic\r\nsentimentalism, and his associations, germinated the _Decembriseur's_\r\nscheme for mediation and humiliation.\r\n\r\nFurther is to be found in the Yellow Book the evidence how, from the\r\nstart of this dark rebellion, Mr. Seward, the master spirit of the\r\nAdministration, dealt death blows to all energetic, unyielding\r\nprosecution of the war for crushing the rebellion, and that he was\r\ndouble-dealing in all his public actions. The published state papers\r\nof the French government disclose the fact that nine months ago Mr.\r\nSeward sent the French minister to Richmond with a mission to invite\r\nthe Jeff. Davises, Hunters, Wigfalls, Benjamins and others to come\r\nback to their seats in the Senate, and in the name of the cruelly\r\noutraged North, Mr. Seward proffered to the traitors a hearty\r\nwelcome. So says the French diplomat in his official dispatch to the\r\nFrench Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Such underhanded dealings\r\nshould not be allowed, and most assuredly would be stringently\r\npunished, if perpetrated under similar circumstances by the minister\r\nof any European government dealing with treason in arms. But here,\r\nMr. Seward's impudence--if not worse--displays its flying colors.\r\nThe Republican press will swallow all this, and Senator Sumner as\r\nChairman of the Committee will--keep quiet.\r\n\r\nThat confidential mission entrusted to the French diplomat by Mr.\r\nSeward, was more than sufficient to evoke the subsequent attempt at\r\nmediation, because it revealed to the piercing eye of European\r\nstatesmanship, how the Administration, and above all how its master\r\nspirit had little confidence in the cause; it revealed the want of\r\nearnestness in official quarters. I hate and denounce all attempts,\r\neven by the most friendly foreign power, to meddle with the internal\r\naffairs of our country. But I have some little knowledge of European\r\nstatecraft, of European diplomacy, of European rulers, and of\r\nEuropean diplomats; and I assert, emphatically, that they are\r\nemboldened to offer their meddlesome services because they have very\r\nlittle if any respect for our official leaders; and because the want\r\nof energy and of good faith to the principles of the North as\r\ndisplayed by Seward, he nevertheless remaining at the helm, has\r\nfirmly settled the conviction in European minds, that the rebels\r\ncannot be crushed by such traffickers and used up politicians as\r\nhave in their hands the destinies of the Union.\r\n\r\n_February 5._--The new Copperhead Senators--in their appearance\r\nresembling bushwhackers; the pillars of Copperheadism in the House,\r\ntake umbrage at the sight and the name of New England, and abuse the\r\nNew England spirit with all their coppery might. Well they may. So\r\ndid Satan hate and abuse light.\r\n\r\nPatriot Stanton is earnestly at work concerning the organization of\r\nAfrico-Americans on a mighty scale; busy against him, likewise, are\r\nthe intriguers, the traitors, the cavillers, the Sewardites and the\r\nMcClellanites, all being of the same kidney. Seward sighs for\r\nMcClellan. But Stanton will override the muddy storm. He has at his\r\nside men as pure, energetic and devoted as Watson, a patriot without\r\na flaw.\r\n\r\nStanton surrounds himself and selects young men--as far as he can,\r\nhe crowds out the remains of Scott, so tenderly protected by\r\nLincoln. Could he only have swept out the rest of the old fogies!\r\nUndoubtedly these young men in the War Department would give new\r\nlife to it.\r\n\r\n_February 6._--The people at large are at a loss to find the cause\r\nof the recent disasters. The general axiom is, \"we are not a\r\nmilitary nation.\" Neither is the South. But here they forget that\r\nevery great or small effect has its--not only--cause, but several\r\ncauses. Many such causes have been repeatedly pointed out. Old\r\nroutine in military organization stands foremost. Few, if any,\r\nunderstand wherein consists the proper organization of an army, and\r\nmost have notions reaching back sixty years. The medical and\r\nsurgical bureaus are obsolete. Governor Andrew of Massachusetts, who\r\nis always on the right side, and with him many young men, insisted\r\nupon organizing the above services as they are organized in the\r\nContinental armies of Europe. But even in the Senate prevailed the\r\nrespect for dusty, rusty, domestic tradition. The few changes forced\r\nby the outcry of the people cure not the evil. Skeletons and not\r\nmen are at work, and if they are not skeletons they are leeches of\r\nthe government and of the people's blood.\r\n\r\nThus likewise, when the organizations of the staffs was discussed,\r\nno one had the first notion of the nature and duties of a staff; and\r\nthe military authorities were as ignorant as the civilians. Of\r\ncourse a McClellan, then a Halleck, Meigs, Hitchcock, etc., could\r\nnot disperse the fog. Many Congressmen were thunderstruck by the\r\ndisplay of words which, as they were purely technical terms, the\r\nCongressmen in question could not understand. Others sought for\r\nguidance in the Staff of Wellington, and thus oddly but unmistakably\r\nproved themselves completely in the dark as to the difference\r\nbetween the personal staff of the commander of an army, and the\r\nStaff of that Army itself. And all this in a country of the most\r\nrapid movement and progress, and amongst a people which\r\nunhesitatingly adopts and adapts to its own needs and welfare almost\r\nevery novelty from almost every part of the world. The great fault\r\ncommitted by the People is its too great respect for false\r\nauthorities and false prophets.\r\n\r\nThe so-called honest Conservatives have exercised and still continue\r\nto exercise a most fatal influence on public affairs, and especially\r\non what is called the domestic policy. These same \"honest\r\nConservatives\" are more dangerous than the out-spoken Copperheads;\r\nmore dangerous, perhaps, than all the friends of slavery and foes\r\nof the Union combined. These \"honest Conservatives\" have contrived\r\nto surround themselves with a halo of honesty and respectability.\r\nBut they as cordially hate and dread every vivid light and vigorous\r\nprogress as the traitors themselves do. Those Conservatives opposed\r\nevery vigorous measure. They spoke tenderly of the \"misguided\r\nbrethren\" in the South, and took their own servile and blundering,\r\nthough quite possibly sincere fancies, for actual and tangible\r\nfacts. The honest Conservatives will support whatever is slow,\r\ndouble-dealing, and, therefore, conservative. The honest\r\nConservatives took McClellan to their honest hearts, and not one of\r\nthem has any clear notion of military affairs, and still less can\r\nany of them fathom the awful depth of McClellan's military\r\ncriminality. I repeat what I said in the first volume of my Diary:\r\nMcClellan and his tail fell, not on account of their Democratism, or\r\ntheir pro-slavery creed, but because McClellan repeatedly displayed\r\nall the worst qualities of a thoroughly unsoldierly commander. No\r\none would have uttered a word of censure if McClellan with his\r\nhundred and eighty thousand men had surrounded the thirty to forty\r\nthousand rebels in Centreville and Manassas in the winter of 1861-2,\r\nand taken some nobler trophies than camp manure and maple guns! The\r\nhonest Conservatives attack and hate Stanton, yet not one of them\r\nhas any notion whatever of Stanton's action towards McClellan.\r\nStanton would have been the first to raise McClellan sky-high if\r\nMcClellan had preferred to fight instead of reposing in his bed in\r\nWashington, and then in various muds. Such is your knowledge of this\r\nand of all other public affairs, O respectable soul and spiritless\r\nbody of honest Conservatives! Historians of this country! collect\r\nthe names of the _honest_ Conservatives, but expose them not to the\r\nabomination of coming generations.\r\n\r\n_February 7._--The Sanitary Commission, with all its branches and\r\nsubdivisions, is among the noblest manifestations of what can be\r\ndone by a free people, and how private enterprise of intelligent,\r\npatriotic and unselfish men can confer benefit. Nor must the praise\r\nof that great work be limited to men. Warm-hearted gentlewomen also\r\nhave done their share in it. The Sanitary Commission is one of the\r\nbest out-croppings of self-government, and does honor to the people,\r\nand softens and ameliorates the warlike roughness of the times.\r\n\r\nThe Sanitary Commission marks a new era in the history of genuine\r\nand not bogus and merely verbal philanthropy, and its spontaneity\r\nand expansion were only possible in free, and therefore humane and\r\nenlightened America.\r\n\r\n_February 8._--Mr. Seward is busily at work endeavoring to crush the\r\nradicals, and to make the Emancipation Proclamation a mere sheet of\r\nwaste paper. All that is mean and nasty, all that is reeking and\r\nfoul with all kinds of corruptions, takes Seward for its\r\nstandard-bearer. The so-called radical press aids Seward with all\r\nits might.\r\n\r\n_February 9._--Gen. Casey adopts some of my ideas and suggestions,\r\nwhich I discussed with him. Gen. Casey is honestly at work, and the\r\nnew tactics will be in print.\r\n\r\nStanton would wish to establish a thorough military camp on a large\r\nscale, for organizing Africo-Americans. But the higher powers are\r\nagainst it. Virginia, the most populous slave state, the nursery of\r\nslaves, must, scorpion-like, be surrounded with glowing contraband\r\ncamps. What a splendid position for such a camp is Harper's Ferry\r\nunder the shadow of immortal John Brown!\r\n\r\nA few days ago, Mr. Lincoln was full of joy because the defences of\r\nWashington are in excellent condition. Thus the country will learn\r\nwith joy that the----spade is still at work, that the military curse\r\nhurled by Scott and McClellan is still influencing the operation of\r\nthe war, that Halleck is the worthy continuator of his predecessors,\r\nthat Mr. Lincoln's fears and uneasiness about the fate of the city\r\nof Washington are slowly, slowly assuaged, that the President's\r\nfancy is nursed, that the construction of the extensive\r\nfortifications around the capital is still continued, that new forts\r\nare continually erected, that the fear of an attack on Washington is\r\nstill paramount, and that to-day--sixty to seventy thousand troops\r\nare kept idle in these old and new forts--when Rosecrans has no\r\nsuccor, when Texas is lost, and when the whole rebel region\r\ntrembles under the tread of savage hordes.\r\n\r\nThrough one of its clerks, the State Department intends to sue me\r\nfor libel, contained, as they say, in the first volume of my\r\n_Diary_. Well, great masters, if you swallow me, you may not digest\r\nme. Let us try.[2]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 2: I must here record that Mr. Carlisle, the\r\n         eminent lawyer in Washington, although in every respect\r\n         opposed to my political and social views, behaved, in this\r\n         affair, as a thorough man of honor. I am sorry that on a\r\n         similar former occasion, not in Washington, my political\r\n         friends showed themselves not Carlisles.]\r\n\r\n_February 10._--... mens agitat molem ... oh, could I only believe\r\nthat such is the case with Mr. Lincoln, how devoted I could become,\r\nand loyal to him, according to the new theory of the lickspittles\r\nand politicians!\r\n\r\n_February 10._--Resolute Senator Grimes did what was the duty of\r\nSumner to have done long ago. Grimes presented resolutions relative\r\nto the mission of Mercier to Richmond, a mission allowed, almost\r\nauthorized by Mr. Seward. Mercier cannot be blamed, and his veracity\r\nis supported by the fact that Lord Lyons was at once informed of the\r\nwhole transaction, and Lord Lyons is to be believed. Seward will\r\nplay the innocent, and take his refuge in the god of--lies.\r\n\r\n_February 12._--In his answer to the Senate, Mr. Seward gives to\r\nMercier the lie direct. It will be rich if Mercier stands square.\r\n\r\n_February 12._--Congress draws to its close. Lincoln accumulates\r\npowers, responsibilities, and hereafter perhaps curses, sufficient\r\nto break the turtle on which stands the elephant that sustains the\r\nSanscrit world.\r\n\r\n_February 13._--The almost imperceptible ripple on the diplomatic pool\r\nof Washington has disappeared. Simple people might have believed that\r\nthere was an issue of veracity between Mr. Seward and the French\r\nMinister. But since a long, a very long time, Seward and veracity have\r\nrun in different orbits, and diplomats, Talleyrand-like, ought to be\r\nthe incarnation of equanimity even if any one--diplomatically--treads\r\non their toes. Besides, the answer given to the Senate before it\r\nreached its destination _might have been arranged_ at any such\r\nconfidential chat as was that one where the little innocent,\r\nnobody-hurting (no, not even the people's honour) trip to Richmond was\r\nconcocted. The French Minister's name _appears not_ in the document\r\nsent to the Senate; so the lie direct is after all only a constructive\r\nlie; nobody is hurt. A general shaking of hands and all is well. But\r\nstrange things may come out yet, and others may not be so blazened\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe soap bubble of mediation exploded under the nose of the French\r\nschemers. The soap used by them was of the finest and most aromatic\r\nquality, but the democratic nerves of the American people resisted\r\nthe Franco-diplomatic cunningly mixed aroma. The applause gained by\r\nMr. Seward's very indifferent document, wherein the great initiator\r\nof the Latin race on this free continent was rebuked, the\r\nsatisfaction shown by the public, ought to open the eyes of the\r\nsentimental French trio. They ought to understand, by this time,\r\nthat Seward's argumentative dispatch, incomplete and below mark as\r\nit is, won applause, although it expresses only the hundredth of the\r\npatriotic ire bursting from the people's bosom. Otherwise the people\r\nwould have at once found out all skillfully, cunningly,\r\nchameleon-like Seward dodges, which ignore before Europe the sublime\r\ncharacter of the struggle forced by treason upon the loyal free\r\nStates; and in which how he avoids to hurt the slavocracy.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial mediator and bottle-holder to slavocracy belies not his\r\nbloody origin and his bloody appetites. The events in Egypt, the\r\nnegro kidnapping in Alexandria, have torn the mask from his astute\r\npolicy. If, for his filibustering raid into Mexico, Louis Napoleon\r\nwanted colored soldiers accustomed to the climate, he could raise\r\nthem among the free colored population of the French possessions in\r\nMartinique, Guadaloupe, etc. But to use the freemen from the\r\nAntilles would have set a bad example to the Africo-Americans in the\r\nrevolted States; Louis Napoleon wished not to hurt or offend his\r\nslaveocratic pets and traitors; by kidnapping slaves in Egypt the\r\nFrench ruler showed how highly he values the stealing qualities of\r\nthe Southern chivalry--and he paid a tribute to the principle of\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nBut while treating with all possible horror and disrespect the\r\nFrench officiousness, the American people ought not to forget the\r\ninnermost interconnection of events. If the French diplomacy, if the\r\nFrench Cabinet became sentimental at the sight of our deadly\r\nstruggle with the demon of treason, it was because they witnessed\r\nour helplessness, and witnessed the uninterrupted chain of faults\r\nand of bad policy; it was because they and the whole world saw the\r\nwant of earnestness in our official leaders; and from all this these\r\n_Messieurs_ concluded that the patriots of the North never will be\r\nable to crush the traitors in the South. So speak the French\r\ndiplomatic documents, so speaks Mercier, Drouyn de l'Huys and Louis\r\nNapoleon; and has not the Seward-Weed influence, paramount in the\r\npolicy of the Government, brought about all these bad results,\r\npalsied the war, and thus almost justified the officiousness of the\r\n_Messieurs_?\r\n\r\n_February 13._--Many forebode the downfall, the dissolution, and the\r\ndisappearance of the Republican party. That may be, and if so then\r\none of the cardinal laws of human progress, development and\r\nascension, will be fullfilled. _The initiator either perishes by the\r\ninitiated, or the initiator perishes, disappears because his\r\nspecial mission, his task is done._\r\n\r\nThe progress of humanity is marked by the sacrifice and death of its\r\ninitiators. Such was the end of the founders of religions, of\r\nsocieties; such of political bodies. Osiris, Lycurgus, Romulus,\r\nChrist, the martyrs, the apostles, are a few from numberless\r\nillustrations that might be cited. The Long Parliament, the French\r\nConvention, disappeared after having fullfilled the work of\r\ndestruction pointed out to them by the genius of progress and of our\r\nrace. As an organized political party the Republican may disappear\r\nwith the war, for slavery is finally destroyed. This is the noble\r\ninitiation and solution fulfilled by the Republican party. To\r\ndestroy slavery and the political defenders and props of slavery,\r\nwas the mission that was fatally thrown or entrusted by inexorable\r\ndestiny to the Republican party. With the destruction of slavery,\r\ndisappears from the political life of America the _Northern man with\r\nSouthern principles_; those very dregs of dregs of all times and of\r\nall political bodies and societies. Slavery is destroyed both\r\nvirtually and _de facto_, new issues are looming, new solutions will\r\nbe given, and new men will bear the new word.\r\n\r\nAll in creation, and in every party, has its light and its shadow,\r\nits pure principle, its pure men and its dregs. Every party has its\r\nfaults and its shortcomings. The dregs fall, and the work of the\r\nparty is done. Some of the chiefs and leaders of the Republican\r\nparty became faithless, (Seward,) went over to darkness, but thereby\r\nthe onward march to the sacred aim was not arrested. The\r\nirresistible current of events and of human affairs carried onwards\r\nthe Republican party. Perhaps unconsciously, but nevertheless\r\nemphatically, the Republican party in its _ensemble_ was a\r\nprovidential agency; it became the incarnation of the loftiest\r\naspirations of the best among the American people. Against its wish\r\nand will, contrary to expectations, the Republican party was\r\nchallenged to action; the sword of law, of justice and of right, was\r\nforcibly thrust into the party's hand, and slavocracy, the\r\nchallenger, is already bleeding its life-blood, and its death-knell\r\nresounds from pole to pole. To speak the language of politicians;\r\nabolition, emancipation by the sword, was forced upon the Republican\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nAnd the Republican party carried out the principle of the preamble\r\nof the bill of rights; a principle eternal as right, but\r\nnevertheless hitherto only partially realized. The Republican party\r\nhas borne the brunt, and accomplished the appointed evolutions of\r\nprogress; and the Republican party has deserved well of the American\r\npeople, of history and of humanity. And the children and\r\ngrandchildren of those who to-day cavil, defile and stone the party,\r\nthey hereafter will bless the Republican party, who, with noble\r\nconsciousness can say to the spirit of light and of duty: _Nunc\r\ndimitte in pacem servum tuum Domine._\r\n\r\nOne of the best evidences of purity and of the elevation of the\r\nRepublican party in its noblest representative men is that the\r\nobtusest among the great diplomats shunned the Republicans as little\r\nmonsters shun the daylight. I mention this as a collateral\r\nillustration without intending to raise a diplomat or the poor\r\ndiplomacy of the world to an undeserved significance, for I bear in\r\nmind the behest, _ne misceantur sacra prophanis_.\r\n\r\nThe nobleness of the accomplished mission, the glorious Sunset\r\nwherein will disappear the Republican party, frees, not from\r\nreproaches nor from maledictions, those Republicans who, by their\r\nselfishness and faithlessness, obstructed its progress, and polluted\r\nthe party. Their names remain nailed to the pillory.\r\n\r\nI may here observe that I never belonged and never claimed to belong\r\nto the Republican party. For nearly half a century my creed has\r\nbeen--Onward! onward! struggle, fight, sacrifice for light, for\r\nprogress, for human rights; for that cause fight and struggle under\r\nevery banner, under every name, and in rank and file with every\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n_February 13._--Seward seizes by the hair the occasion proffered to\r\nhim by the _Decembriseur's_ offer of mediation, and tries to\r\nreconquer the confidence of the public. This shows to Drouyn de\r\nl'Huys and to his master, that they are misinformed concerning the\r\ncondition of America, (also M. Mercier misinformed them; how could\r\nhe do otherwise?) The despatch to Dayton, February 7, will lead\r\nastray public opinion. The majority will forget and lose sight of\r\nthe intercatenation of events and actions perpetrated by Mr.\r\nSeward. O Chase! O Sumner! Seward rises with his patient pen and\r\npaper in the inky glory of a patriot, and you----cave in.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Mr. Seward's answer to France, a diplomat observed to\r\nme: \"The European Cabinets are so accustomed to Mr. Seward's\r\nduplicity and want of veracity, that now that Seward refuses to\r\naccept mediation, in Europe they will conclude that Seward's\r\nacceptation of mediation is at hand.\"\r\n\r\n_February 14._--The struggle is for the rights of man, for the\r\nChristian idea, purified of all dogma and worship. Those who see it\r\nnot, are similar to a fish from the Kentucky Cave.\r\n\r\n_February 14._--Could Mr. Lincoln only be inspired, be warmed by the\r\nsacred fire of enthusiasm, then his natural and selected affinities\r\nwould be other minds than those of a Seward, a Weed, a Halleck,\r\netc.; then what is night could become light; and where he painfully\r\ngropes along his path, Mr. Lincoln would march with a firm, almost\r\nwith a godlike step, at the head of such a peerless people as those\r\nof whom he is the Chief Magistrate.\r\n\r\nBut as it is now, I may turn the mind in any direction whatever, all\r\nthe causes of mishaps and disasters converge on Mr. Lincoln.\r\nAccording to his partisans, Mr. Lincoln's intentions are the best,\r\nand he is always trying to conciliate--and to shift. It is useless\r\nto discuss Mr. Lincoln's peculiar ways. In most cases, Mr. Lincoln\r\nuses old, rotten tools for a new and heavy work. I have it from the\r\nmost truthful and positive authority, that Mr. Lincoln is fully\r\nacquainted with the opinions of the so called _dissatisfied_, of\r\nthose with Southern propensities, proclivities and affinities, of\r\nwhom many are in the superior civil and military service. Contrary\r\nto the advice of patriots in the Cabinet and out of it, Mr. Lincoln\r\ninsists upon keeping such at their post--doubtless always expecting\r\nthat they will _turn round_. Such a heavy difficulty and task as is\r\nthe present, must be worked out, with absolute devotion and\r\nsincerity; and can this logically be expected from men whose hearts\r\nand minds are not in their actions? Mr. Lincoln forgets that\r\nthousands of lives and millions of money are sacrificed to the\r\nexperiment as to whether the insincere officials will _turn round_.\r\n\r\nThe cause will not fail, light will not be extinguish, even if the\r\nleaders break down or betray, even if the Copperheads frighten some\r\nof the pilots, or if some of the faithless pilots shake hands with\r\nthe Copperheads, as was the case in the elections of November last\r\nin New York and elsewhere. The people will save light, dissipate\r\ndarkness, save the cause, save the leaders, the pilots and the\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\n_February 15._--Some days ago in compliance with summons, that\r\npedler of all corruptions, Thurlow Weed, came to Washington, and\r\nwith Mr. Seward, his _fidus Achates_, was for days or nights\r\ncloseted with Mr. Lincoln, pouring into the president's soul as much\r\npoison and darkness as was possible. That such was the case can,\r\nbesides, easily be concluded from what that incarnation of all\r\nperversions predicated to all who came within his nauseous\r\npreachings here. According to Mr. T. Weed's revelations, \"_The\r\nproclamation is an absurdity, and the Union will soon--as it\r\nought--be ruled by the rebels._\" So it was told me. Perhaps it is\r\nalready done through Thurlow Weed's mediation and instrumentality.\r\n\r\nContinually inspired by Weed, Mr. Seward is therefore untiring in\r\nhis over-patriotic efforts to preserve the former Union and\r\nSlavery--to save the matricide slave-holders.\r\n\r\nIn what clutches is Mr. Lincoln! Even I pity him. Even I am forced\r\nto give him credit for being what he is--considering his intimacies\r\nand his surroundings. Few men entrusted with power over nations have\r\nresisted such fatal influences,--not even Cromwell and Napoleon.\r\nHistory has not yet settled how it was with Cæsar, and so far as I\r\nknow, Frederick the Great of Prussia is of the very few who have\r\nbeen unimpressionable. Pericles coruscates over ruins and the night\r\nof the ancient world; Pericles's intimacy was with the best and the\r\nmanliest Athenians.\r\n\r\nBut has Mr. Lincoln an unlimited confidence in the few men with\r\nlarge brains and with big hearts, brains and hearts burning with the\r\nsacred and purest patriotic fire? Or are not rather all his\r\nfavorites--not even whitened--sepulchres of manhood, of mind and of\r\nsacred intellect?\r\n\r\n_February 16._--It is asserted, and some day or other it will be\r\nverified, that the Committee on the Conduct of the War have\r\ninvestigated how far certain generals from the army on the\r\nRappahannock used their influence with the President to paralyze a\r\nmovement against the enemy ordered by Burnside. That facts\r\ndiscovered may be published or not, for the Administration shuns\r\npublicity. _The Committee discovered that Mr. Seward was implicated\r\nin that conspiracy of generals against Burnside._ Any qualification\r\nof such conduct is impossible, and the vocabulary of crimes has no\r\nname for it; let it, therefore, be _Sewardism_. The editors of the\r\nNew York _Tribune_ did their utmost to prevent _Sewardism_ being\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\n_February 16._--Often, so to speak, the hand refuses to record what the\r\nhead hears and sees, what the reason must judge. To witness how one of\r\nthe greatest events in the development of mankind, how the deadly\r\nstruggle between right and crime, between good and evil, how the blood\r\nand sweat of _such a people_ are dealt with by--counterfeits!\r\n\r\n_February 17._--Poor Banks! He is ruined by having been last year\r\npressed to Seward's bosom, and having been thus initiated into the\r\nSeward-Weed Union and slavery-restoring policy. Banks and Louis\r\nNapoleon in Mexico and in his mediation scheme; both Banks and\r\nNapoleon were ruined by yielding to bad advice--Banks to that of\r\nSeward, and Louis Napoleon to that of his diplomats. I hope that\r\nBanks will shake off the nightmare that is throttling him now; that\r\nhe will no more write senseless proclamations, will give up the\r\nattempt to save slave-holders, and will march straight to the great\r\ntask of crushing the rebellion and rebels. He will blot slavery,\r\nthat Cain's mark on the brow of the Union; blot it and throw it into\r\nthe marshes of the parishes of Louisiana. I rely upon Banks's sound\r\ncommon sense. He will come out from among the evil ones.\r\n\r\n_February 18._--Under no other transcendent leadership than that of\r\nits patriotism and convictions, the majority of this expiring Congress\r\nboldly and squarely faced the emergencies and all the necessities\r\ndaily, hourly evoked by the Rebellion, and unhesitatingly met them. If\r\nthe majority was at times confused, the confusion was generated by\r\nmany acts of the administration, and not by any shrinking before the\r\nmighty and crushing task, or by the attempt to evade the\r\nresponsibility. The impartial historian will find in the Statutes an\r\nundisputable confirmation of my assertions. The majority met all the\r\nprejudices against taxation, indebtedness, paper currency, draft, and\r\nother similar cases.\r\n\r\nAnd all the time the majority of Congress was stormed by traitors,\r\nby intriguers, by falsifiers and prisoners of public opinion; the\r\nminority in Congress taking the lead therein. Many who ought to\r\nhave supported the majority either fainted or played false. The\r\nso-called good press, neither resolute nor clear-sighted, nor\r\nfar-seeing, more than once confused, and as a whole seldom\r\nthoroughly supported the majority.\r\n\r\nIf the good press had the indomitable courage in behalf of good and\r\ntruth, that the _Herald_ has in behalf of untruth and of mischief,\r\nhow differently would the affairs look and stand!\r\n\r\n_February 19._--Jackson first formed, attracted and led on the\r\npeople's opinion. Has not Mr. Lincoln thrown confusion around?\r\n\r\n_February 19._--The Supreme Court of the United States has before it\r\nthe prize cases resulting from captures made by our navy. The\r\ncounsel for the English and rebel blockade-runners and pilferers\r\nfind the best point of legal defence in the unstatesmanlike and\r\nunlegal wording of the proclamation of the blockade, as concocted\r\nand issued by Mr. Seward, and in the repeated declarations contained\r\nin the voluminous diplomatic correspondence of our Secretary of\r\nState,--declarations asserting that _no war whatever is going on in\r\nthe Federal Republic_. No war, therefore no lawful prizes on the\r\nocean. So ignorance, and humbug mark every step of this foremost\r\namong the pilots of a noble, high-minded, but too confiding people.\r\n\r\nThe facts, the rules, and the principles in these prize cases are\r\nalmost unprecedented and new; new in the international laws, and\r\nnew in the history of governments of nations. Seldom, if ever, were\r\nso complicated the powers of government, its rights, and the duties\r\nof neutrals, the rights and the duties of the captors, and the\r\ncondition of the captured. This rebellion is, so to speak, _sui\r\ngeneris_, almost unprecedented on land and sea. The difficulties and\r\ncomplications thus arising, became more complicated by the either\r\nreckless or unscientific (or both) turn given by the State\r\nDepartment in conceding to the rebels the condition of belligerents.\r\nThus the great statutory power of the sovereign, (that is, of the\r\nUnion through its president) for the suppression of the rebellion\r\nwas palsied at the start. The insurrection of the Netherlands alone\r\nhas some very small similarity with our civil war; however, that\r\ninsurrection took place at a time when very few, if any, principles\r\nof international laws were generally laid down and generally\r\nrecognized. Here the municipal laws, the right of the sovereign and\r\nhis duty to save itself and the people, the rights and the laws of\r\nwar, wrongly applied to such virtual outlaws as the rebels, the\r\nmaritime code of prize laws and rules, play into and intertwine each\r\nother. When Mr. Seward penned his doleful proclamation of the\r\nblockade, etc., he never had before his mind what a mess he\r\ngenerated; what complications might arise therefrom. I am sure he\r\nnever knew that such proclamation was _a priori_ pregnant with\r\ncomplications, and that at least its wording ought to have been very\r\ncareful. Mr. Seward was not at all cognizant of the fact that the\r\nwording of a proclamation of a blockade, for the time being, lays\r\ndown a rule for the judges in the prize courts. For him it was\r\nrather a declamation than a proclamation; he who believed the\r\nrebellion would end in July, 1861, and that no occasion would arise\r\nto apply the rules of the blockade.\r\n\r\nThus Mr. Seward, with his thorough knowledge of international law\r\nrendered difficult the position of the captors; he equally increased\r\nthe difficulty for the judge to administer justice. By this\r\nproclamation and the commentaries put on it, Mr. Seward curtailed\r\nthe rights of the government of which he is a part, conceded undue\r\nconditions to the rebels, and facilitated to the neutrals the means\r\nof violating his blockade. So much is clear and palpable to-day, and\r\nI am sure more complications and imbecilities are in store. If Mr.\r\nSeward had had good advisors for these nice and difficult questions,\r\nhe would not have blundered in this way. Thus Charles Eames, who in\r\nthe pleadings before the Superior United States Court has shown a\r\nconsummate mastery in prize questions--Eames could teach Mr. Seward\r\na great deal about the constitutional powers of the president to\r\nsuppress the rebellion, and about the meaning and the bearing of\r\ninternational maritime laws, rights, duties and rules.\r\n\r\n_February 20._--A Mr. Funk, a member of the Illinois Senate, a\r\nfarmer, and a man of sixty-five years, on February 13, made a speech\r\nin that body which sounds better than all the rhetories and\r\noratories. It was the sound and genuine utterance of a man from the\r\npeople, and I hope some future historian will record the speech and\r\nthe name of the old, indomitable patriot.\r\n\r\n_February 20._--Stimulated by a pure Athenian breeze, the Congress\r\npassed a law organizing an Academy of Sciences. What a gigantic\r\nfolly; the only one committed by this Congress. The pressure was\r\nvery great, and exercised by the bottomless vanity of certain\r\nscientific, self-styled magnates, and by the Athenians. Up to this\r\nday, the American scientific development and progress consisted in\r\nits freedom and independence. No legal corporation impeded and\r\ntrammeled the limitless scope of the intellectual and scientific\r\ndevelopment. That was the soul and secret of our rapid and luminous\r\nonward march. Now fifty patented, incorporated respectabilities will\r\nput the curb on, will hamper the expansion. Academies turn to\r\nfossils. My hope is that the true American spirit will soar above\r\nthe vanity and pettiness of corporated wisdom, and that this\r\nscientific Academy bubble will end in inanity and in ridicule. I am\r\nsorry that Congress was taken in, and committed such a blunder. It\r\nwas caught napping.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase's bank bill, prospective of money, and as many say,\r\nprospective of presidency, passed the house. What fools are they\r\nalready begin to direct their steps and their ardent wishes toward\r\nthe White House.\r\n\r\n_February 22._--The, at any price, supporters of the Administration,\r\npoint with satisfaction to the various successes, and to the space\r\nof land already redeemed from rebellion. I protest against such\r\nexplanation given to events, and call to it the attention of every\r\nfuture historian. Never had the _suum cuique_ required a more\r\nstringent, philosophical application. With the various inexhaustible\r\nmeans at its disposal, with the unextinguishable enthusiasm of the\r\npeople, far different and more conclusive results, _could_ and ought\r\nto have been obtained. The ship makes headway if even, by the\r\nnegligence of the officers and of the crew, she drags a cable or an\r\nanchor. The ship is the people dragging its administrators.\r\n\r\nA western Democrat, but patriot, said to me that Lincoln compares to\r\nJeff Davis, as a wheel-barrow does to a steam engine!\r\n\r\nThe Democrats claim to be the genuine fighting element, and to be\r\npossessed of the civic courage, and of governmental capacity. How,\r\nthen, can the Democrats rave for McClellan, the most unfighting\r\nsoldier ever known?\r\n\r\nThe future historian must be warned not to look to the newspapers\r\nfor information concerning facts and concerning the spirit of the\r\npeople. The _Tribune's_ senile clamor for peace, for arbitration,\r\nfor meditation, its Jewitt, Mercier, Napoleon, and Switzerland\r\ncombinations, fell dead and in ridicule before the sound judgment of\r\nninety-nine hundredths of the people.\r\n\r\n_February 24._--In Europe I had experience of political prisons and\r\nof their horror. But I would prefer to rot, to be eaten up by rats,\r\nrather than be defended by such arch-copperheads as are the Coxes,\r\nthe Biddles, the Powells, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion concerning the issue of the letters of marque,\r\nSumner was dwelling in sentimentalities and generalities, altogether\r\nlosing sight of the means of defense of the country, and the genuine\r\nnational resources. With all respect for high and sentimental\r\nprinciples and patriotism, with due reverence of the opinion, the\r\napplause or the condemnatory verdict to be issued by philanthropists,\r\nby doctors, and other Tommities, my heart and my brains prefer the\r\nresolute, patriotic, manly Grimes, Wades, etc., the various _skippers_\r\nand masters, all of whom look not over the ocean for applause, but\r\nabove all have in view to save or to defend the country, whatever be\r\nthe rules or expectations of the self-constituted Doctors of\r\nInternational laws.\r\n\r\n_February 25._--The Union-Slavery saviours, led on by the _Herald_,\r\nby Seward, by Weed, etc., all are busily at work.\r\n\r\n_Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from\r\nus._\r\n\r\nI hear that great disorder prevails in the Quartermaster's Department.\r\nIt is no wonder. In all armies, countries, government and wars, the\r\nQuartermaster's Department is always disorderly. Why shall it not be\r\nso here, when want of energy is the word? At times Napoleon hung or\r\nshot such infamous thieves, as by their thefts skinned and destroyed\r\nthe soldiers and the army; at times in Russia, such curses are sent to\r\nSiberia. But as yet, I have not heard that any body was hurt here,\r\nwith the exception of the treasury of the country, and of the\r\nsoldiers. The chain-gang of those quartermaster's thieves,\r\ncontractors, jobbers and lobbyists must be strong, very long, and\r\ncomposed of all kind of influential and not-influential vampyres.\r\nSomebody told me, perhaps in joke, that all of them constitute a kind\r\nof free-masonry, and have signs of recognition. After all, that may be\r\ntrue. Impudence, brazen brow, and blank conscience may be among such\r\nsigns of recognition.\r\n\r\n_February 26._--O, could I only win confidence in Mr. Lincoln, it\r\nwould be one of the most cheerful days and events in my life.\r\nPerhaps, elephant-like, Mr. Lincoln slowly, cautiously but surely\r\nfeels his way across a bridge leading over a precipice. Perhaps so;\r\nonly his slowness is marked with blood and disasters. But the most\r\ndiscouraging and distressing is his _cortège_, his official and\r\nunofficial friends. Mars Stanton, Neptune Welles, are good and\r\nreliable, but have no decided preponderance. Astrea-Themis-Bates is\r\nmostly right when disinfected from border-State's policy, and from\r\nfear of direct, unconditional emancipation. But neither in Olympus\r\nnor in Tartarus, neither in heaven nor in hell, can I find names of\r\nprototypes for the official and unofficial body-guard which,\r\ncommanded by Seward, surrounds and watches Mr. Lincoln, so that no\r\nray of light, no breath of spirit and energy may reach him.\r\n\r\n_February 26._--This civil war with its _cortège_ of losses and\r\ndisasters, which after all fall most bloodily and crushingly on the\r\nlaborious, and rather comparatively, poorer part of the whole\r\npeople; perhaps all this will form the education of the rank and\r\nfile of the political Democratic party. The like Democratic masses\r\nare intellectually by far inferior to the Republican masses.\r\nExperience will perhaps teach those unwashed Democrats how degrading\r\nwas their submission to slavocracy, which reduced them to the\r\ncondition of political helots. This rank and file may find out how\r\nthey were blindfolded by slave breeders and their northern abettors.\r\nA part of the Democratic masses were, and still are kept in as\r\nbrutal political ignorance and depravity as are the poor whites in\r\nthe South, under whatever name one may record them. Now, or never,\r\nis the time for the _unwashed_ to find out that during their\r\nalliance with the Southern traitors, all genuine manhood, all that\r\nennobles, elevates the man and warms his heart, was poisoned or\r\nviolently torn from them--that brutality is not liberty, and\r\nfinally, that the Northern leaders have been or are more abject than\r\nabjectness itself. If the rank and file finds out all this, the\r\nblood and disasters are, in part at least, atoned for.\r\n\r\n_February 27._--O! could I from every word, from every page of this\r\nDiary, for eternities, make coruscate the nobleness, the simple\r\nfaith with which the people sacrifices all to the cause. To be\r\nbiblical, the sacrifice of the people is as pure as was that made\r\nby Abel; that made by the people's captains, leaders, pilots is\r\nCain-like.\r\n\r\n_February 27._--All the Copperheads fused together have done less\r\nmischief, have less distorted and less thrown out of the track the\r\nholy cause, they have exercised a less fatal and sacrilegious\r\ninfluence, they are responsible for less blood and lives, than is\r\nMr. Seward, with all his arguments and spread-eagleism. Even\r\nMcClellan and McClellanism recede before Seward and Sewardism, the\r\nlatter having generated the former. In times of political\r\nconvulsions, perverse minds and intellects at the helm, more fatally\r\ninfluence the fate of a nation than do lost battles. Lost battles\r\noften harden the temper of a people; a perverse mind vitiates it.\r\n\r\n_February 27._--Gold rises, and no panic, a phenomenon upsetting the\r\nold theories of political economy. This rise will not affect the\r\npublic credit, will not even ruin the poor. I am sure it will be so,\r\nand political economy, as every thing else in this country, will\r\nreceive new and more true solutions for its old, absolute problems.\r\nThe genuine credit, the prosperity of this country, is wholly\r\nindependent of this or that financial or governmental would-be\r\ncapacity; is independent of European exchanges, and of the\r\nappreciation by the Rothschilds, the Barings, and whatever be the\r\nnames of the European appraisers. The American credit is based on\r\nthe consciousness of the people, and on the faith in its own\r\nvitality, in its inexhaustible intellectual and material resources.\r\nThe people credits to itself, it asks not the foreigners to open\r\nfor it any credit. The foreign capitalists will come and beg. The\r\nnation is not composed here as it is composed all over Europe, of a\r\nlarge body of oppressed, who are cheated, taxed by the upper-strata\r\nand by a Government. Thus credit and discredit in America have other\r\ncauses and foundations, their fluctuations differ from all that\r\ndecides such eventualities in Europe.\r\n\r\nI am sure that subsequent events will justify these my assertions.\r\n\r\n_February 28._--Inveterate West Pointers got hold of the dizzy\r\nbrains of some Senators and of other Congressmen, and Congress\r\nwasted its precious time in regulating the military position of\r\nengineers. This action of Congress is a _pendant_ to the Academy of\r\nSciences. The leaders in this discussion proved to _nausea_; 1st.\r\nTheir utter ignorance of the whole military science, of its\r\nsubdivisions, branches and classifications; 2d. Their ignorance of\r\nthe nature of intellectual hierarchy in sciences; 3d. Those\r\nCongressional wiseacres proved how easily the West Point Engineers\r\nhumbugged them. Congress consecrates the engineer as number one.\r\nCongress had better send a trustful man to Europe, to the continent,\r\nand find out what is considered as number one in the science of\r\nwarfare. But every luminous body throws a shadow; the Academy of\r\nSciences, and this number one, are the shadows thrown by that\r\npolitical body.\r\n\r\n_February 28._--Seldom, if ever, in history was the vital principle\r\nof a society, of a nation, of a Government, so bitterly assailed,\r\nand its destruction attempted by combined elements and forces of the\r\nmost hellish origin and nature, as the vital principle of American\r\ninstitutions is now assailed. The enemies, the sappers, the miners,\r\nare the Union-Slavery-Saviours of all kinds and hues. But darkness\r\ncannot destroy light, nor cold overpower heat:--so the united\r\nconspiracy will not prevail against light and right and justice.\r\n\r\n_February 28._--The last batch of various generals sent for\r\nconfirmation to the Senate, reflects and illustrates the manner in\r\nwhich promotion is managed, and military powers and capacity\r\nestimated at the White House.\r\n\r\nHooker and Heintzelman are made major generals because they\r\nbrilliantly fought at Williamsburgh, and Sumner is likewise promoted\r\nfor Williamsburgh, where, in pursuance of McClellan's orders, Sumner\r\nlooked on when Heintzelman and Hooker were almost cut to pieces. The\r\ndignitaries of Halleck's pacific staff are promoted, and colonels\r\nwho fight, and who, by their bravery and blood correct or neutralize\r\nthe awful deadly blunders of Halleck and of his staff, such colonels\r\nare _not_ promoted!\r\n\r\n_February 28._--Congress outlawed all foreign intervention,\r\nmediation! Catch it, foreign meddlers. Catch it, _Decembriseur_ and\r\nyour lackeys.\r\n\r\n_February 28._--Congress by its boldness, saved the immaculate\r\nRepublican idea, saved the principle of self-government, and\r\ndeserves the gratitude of all those from pole to pole, who have at\r\nheart the triumph of freedom, the triumph of light! To its last\r\nhours, this Congress had to overcome all the mean, petty appetites\r\nand cravings, which so often palsy, defile, or at the best,\r\nneutralize the noblest activity; Congress had to overcome\r\nprejudices, narrow-mindedness and bad faith. Many of the so called\r\npolitical friends--_vide_, the great Republican press--are as\r\ntroublesome, as much nuisances, as are the Sewardites and the\r\nCopperheads. Others accuse the Congress for not having done enough.\r\nCopperheads and Sewardites accuse Congress of having done too much.\r\nAnd thus, the majority of Congress marches on across impediments and\r\nabuses thrown in its way both by friends and by enemies.\r\n\r\nThe _Tribune_ bitterly and boldly attacks Dahlgren, and trembling\r\ncaves in before Seward. Of course! Dahlgren can only send 11 and 15\r\ninch shells to crush the enemy; brother politician Seward can be\r\nuseful for some scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH, 1863.\r\n\r\n     Press -- Ethics -- President's Powers -- Seward's Manifestoes --\r\n     Cavalry -- Letters of Marque -- Halleck -- Siegel -- Fighting --\r\n     McDowell -- Schalk -- Hooker -- Etat Major-General -- Gold --\r\n     Cloaca Maxima -- Alliance -- Burnside -- Halleckiana -- Had we\r\n     but Generals, how often Lee could have been destroyed, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 1._--Unprecedented is the fact in the history of\r\nconstitutionally-governed nations, that the patriots of a political\r\nparty in power, that its most devoted and ardent men, as a question\r\nof life or death, are forced to support and defend an Administration\r\nwhich they placed at the helm, and whose many, many acts they\r\ndisapprove.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers in the hospitals die the death of confessors to the\r\ngreat cause. And the hair turns not white on the heads of those\r\nwhose policy, helplessness, and ignorance, crowd the hospitals with\r\nthe people's best children.\r\n\r\n_March 2._--The New-York _Times_--one among the great beacons and\r\nauthorities in the country--the New York _Times_ belies its title as\r\nthe \"little villain.\" Gigantically, Atlas-like, that sheet upholds\r\nSeward and Weed. The _Times_ makes one admire the senile,\r\ncompromising, mediating, arbitrating, and, at times, stumbling\r\n_Tribune_, and the cautious but often ardent _Evening Post_.\r\n\r\nThe _Times_ joins in the outcry against the radicals. It is\r\nSeward-Weed's watchword. It is the watchword of the _Herald_. It is\r\nthe watchword of the most thickly coppered Copperheads. Genuine, pure\r\nconvictions and principles are always radical. Christianity could not\r\nhave been established were not the first Christians most absolute\r\nradicals. They compromised not with heathenism, compromised not with\r\nJudaism, which in every way was their father. Radicals--true\r\nones--look to the great aim, forget their persons, and are not moved\r\nby mean interests and vanities.\r\n\r\nThe press in Europe, above all, on the Continent, is different. Its\r\neditors and contributors risk their liberty, their persons, their\r\npockets, and sacrifice all to their convictions. They are not afraid\r\nto speak out their convictions, even if under the penalty to\r\nlose--subscribers; and that is all the risk run by an American\r\nnewspaper. The _Herald_, the _World_, the _Express_, all organs of\r\nthe evil spirit, through thick and thin, stand to their fetish, that\r\nMcClellan; the Republican papers neither pitilessly attack the\r\nenemies, nor boldly and manfully support the friends, of the cause.\r\n\r\nI nurse no personal likings or dislikings; the times are too mighty,\r\ntoo earnest for such pettiness. For me, men are agencies of\r\nprinciples: bad agencies of an intrinsically good principle are\r\noften more mischievous than are bad principles and their confessors.\r\nThe eternal tendency of human elevation and purification is to\r\neliminate, to dissolve, to uproot social evils, to neutralize or\r\npush aside bad men, in whatever skin they may go about. It is a slow\r\nand difficult, but nevertheless incessant work of our race. It is\r\nconsecrated by all founders of religions, by legislators, by\r\nphilosophers, by moralists; it is an article of human, social and\r\npolitical ethics. As far as I experienced, the European radical\r\npress more strictly observes that rule of political ethics than the\r\nAmerican press is wont to do. And the press, bad or good, is the\r\nhigh pontifex of our times; more than any other social agency\r\nwhatever, the press ought, at least, to be manly, elevated,\r\nindomitable, vigilant and straight-forward. I mean the respectable\r\npress.\r\n\r\n_March 3._--Senator Wilson's kind of farewell speech to the\r\nCopperheads was ringing with fiery and elevated patriotism. It\r\nre-echoed the sentiments, the notions, the aspirations of the\r\npeople. The cobbler of Natick rose above the rhetors, above the\r\ndeliverers of prosy, classical, polished, elaborated orations, above\r\nyoung and above gray-haired Athenians, high as our fiery and stormy\r\nepoch towers over the epochs of quiet, self-satisfied, smooth, cold,\r\nelaborate and soulless civilities.\r\n\r\n_March 4._--Mr. Lincoln hesitates--and, as many assert, is\r\naltogether opposed to use all the severity of the laws against the\r\nrebels. And shall not our butchered soldiers be avenged? It is\r\nsacrilegious to put in the same scales the Union soldier and the\r\nrebels; it is the same as to put on equal terms before justice the\r\nincendiary and the man who stops or kills the criminal in _flagrante\r\ndelicto_.\r\n\r\n_March 3._--After a tedious labor I waded through the State papers.\r\nO, what an accumulation of ignorance! Almost every historical and\r\nchronological fact misplaced, misunderstood, perverted, distorted,\r\nwrongly applied. And how many, many contradictions! Only when Mr.\r\nSeward can simply--(very, very seldom) point out to England that by\r\n_this_ and _that fact_ and _act_ England violates the international\r\nlaws and rules of neutrality and of good comity between two\r\n_friendly_ governments and nations: then, _only_, Mr. Seward's\r\npapers acquire historical and political signification. But not his\r\nspread eagleism, not his argumentation; and, still less his broad\r\nand inexhaustible and variegated information. Diplomatic and\r\nstatesmanlike character can not be conceded to his State papers.\r\nFew, very few, will read them, although foreign Courts, ministers,\r\nstatesmen, princes, and the so-called celebrated women are\r\ncomplimented and deluged with them. The most pitiless critics of\r\nthese productions would be the smaller clerks in the Departments of\r\nForeign Affairs in London and Paris. Only they are not fools to\r\nwaste their time on such specimens of literature.\r\n\r\n_March 4._--Congress adjourned. This Thirty-Seventh Congress marks a\r\nnew era in the American and in the world's history. It inaugurated\r\nand directed a new evolution in the onward progress of mankind. The\r\ntask of this Congress was by far more difficult and heavier than was\r\nthe task of the revolutionary and of the constitutional Congresses.\r\nThe revolutionary Congress had to fight an external enemy. The\r\ntories of that epoch were comparatively less dangerous than are now\r\nall kinds of Copperheads; it had to overcome material wants and\r\nimpediments, and not moral, nor social ones. That Congress was\r\nomnipotent, governed the country, and was backed by its virgin\r\nenthusiasm, by unity of purpose, and was not hampered by any\r\nformulas and precedents. The Thirty-Seventh Congress had to fight a\r\npowerful enemy, spread almost over two-thirds of the territory of\r\nthe Union; it had to fight and stand, so to speak, at home against\r\ninveterate prejudices, against such bitter and dangerous domestic\r\nenemies as are the Northern men with Southern principles. This\r\nCongress was manacled by constitutional formulas, and had to carry\r\nvarious other deadweights already pointed out. In the first part of\r\nthe session, Pike, Member of Congress from Maine, laid down as the\r\ntask for the Congress, _Fight, Tax, Emancipate_--and the Congress\r\nfulfilled the task. In a certain aspect the Thirty-Seventh Congress\r\nshowed itself almost superior to the great immortal French\r\nConvention, which ruled, governed, administered, and legislated,\r\nwhile this Congress dragged a Lincoln, a Seward, etc. This Congress\r\naccomplished noble and great things without containing the so-called\r\n\"great\" or \"representative\" men, and thus Congress thoroughly\r\nvindicated the great social truth of genuine, democratic\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\n_March 5._--The _good_ press reduces the activity of the Thirty\r\nSeventh Congress to its own rather pigmy-like proportions.\r\n\r\nCongress was powerless to purify the corrosive air prevailing in\r\nWashington, above all in the various official strata. Congress\r\nardently wished to purify, but the third side of the Congressional\r\ntriangle, the executive and administrative power, preferred to nurse\r\nthe foul elements. Such doubtful, and some worse than doubtful\r\nofficials, undoubtedly will become more bold, expecting the\r\nnear-at-hand advent of the Copperhead Democratic Millennium.\r\n\r\n_March 6._--The Copperhead members of both the Houses have been very\r\nprolific and _scientific_ about the inferiority of race. Pretty\r\nspecimens of superiority are they, with their sham, superficial, at\r\nhap-hazard gathered, unvaluable small information, with their\r\ninveterate prejudices, with their opaque, heavy, unlofty minds! Give\r\nto any Africo-American equal chances with these props of darkness,\r\nand he very speedily will assert over them an unquestionable\r\nsuperiority. Are not the humble, suffering, orderly contrabands\r\ninfinitely superior to the rowdy, unruly, ignorant, savage and\r\nbloody whites?\r\n\r\nSouthern papers are filled with accounts of the savage persecutions\r\nto which the Union men are exposed in the rebel region. It is the\r\nresult of what Mr. Seward likes to call his forbearing policy and of\r\nthe McClellan and Halleck warfare of 1861-62.\r\n\r\n_March 7._--For the first time in the world's history, for the first\r\ntime in the history of nations governed and administered by\r\npositive, well established, well organised, well defined\r\nlaws--powers, such as those conferred by Congress on Mr. Lincoln,\r\nhave been so conferred. Never have such powers been in advance,\r\ncoolly, legally deliberated, and in advance granted, to any\r\nsovereign, as are forced upon Mr. Lincoln by Congress, and forced\r\nupon him with the assent of a considerable majority of the people.\r\n\r\nNever has a nation or an honest political body whatever, shown to\r\nany mortal a confidence similar to that shown to Mr. Lincoln. Never\r\nin antiquity, in the days of Athens' and Rome's purest patriotism\r\nand civic virtue, has the people invested its best men with a trust\r\nso boundless as did the last Congress give to Mr. Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe powers granted to a Roman dictator were granted for a short\r\ntime, and they were extra legal in their nature and character; in\r\ntheir action and execution the dictatorial powers were rather taken\r\nthan granted in detail. The powers forced on Mr. Lincoln are most\r\nminutely specified; they have been most carefully framed and\r\nsurrounded by all the sacred rites of law, according to justice and\r\nthe written Constitution. These powers are sanctioned by all\r\nformulas constituting the legal cement of a social structure\r\nerected by the freest people that ever existed. These powers deliver\r\ninto Mr. Lincoln's hand all that is dear and sacred to man--his\r\nliberty, his domestic hearth, his family, life and fortune. A well\r\nand deliberately discussed and matured statute puts all such earthly\r\ngoods at Mr. Lincoln's disposal and free use.\r\n\r\nThe sublime axiom, _salus populi suprema lex esto_ again becomes\r\nblood and life, and becomes so by the free, deliberate will and\r\ndecision of the foremost standard-bearer of light and civilization,\r\nthe first born in the spirit of Christian ethics and of the rights\r\nof man.--\r\n\r\nThe Cromwells, the Napoleons, the absolute kings, the autocrats, and\r\nall those whose rule was unlimited and not defined--all such grasped\r\nat such powers. They seized them under the pressure of the direst\r\nnecessity, or to satisfy their personal ambition and exaltation. The\r\nFrench Convention itself exercised unlimited dictatorial powers. But\r\nthe Convention allowed not these powers to be carried out of the\r\nlegislative sanctuary. The Committee of Robespierre was a board\r\nbelonging to and emanating from the Convention; the Commissaries\r\nsent to the provinces and to the armies were members of the\r\nConvention and represented its unlimited powers. When the Committee\r\nof Public Safety wanted a new power to meet a new emergency, the\r\nConvention, so to speak, daily adjusted the law and its might to\r\nsuch emergencies.\r\n\r\nWill Mr. Lincoln realize the grandeur of this unparallelled trust?\r\nHas he a clear comprehension of the sacrifice thus perpetrated by\r\nthe people? I shudder to think about it and to doubt.\r\n\r\nThe men of the people's heart--a Fremont, a Butler, are still\r\nshelved, and the Sewards, the Hallecks, are in positions wherein no\r\ntrue patriot wishes them to be. The Republican press had better\r\nlearn tenacity from the Copperhead press, which never has given up\r\nthat fetish, McClellan, and never misses the slightest occasion to\r\nbring his name in a wreath of lies before the public.\r\n\r\n_March 8._--A great Union meeting in New York. War Democrats,\r\nRepublicans, etc., etc., etc. War to the knife with the rebels is\r\nthe watchword. Of course, Mr. Seward writes a letter to the meeting.\r\nThe letter bristles with stereotyped generalities and Unionism. The\r\nsubstance of the Seward manifesto is: \"Look at me; I, Seward, I am\r\nthe man to lead the Union party. I am not a Republican nor a\r\nDemocrat, but Union, Union, Union.\"\r\n\r\nThe _I_, the No. 1, looks out from every word of that manifesto.\r\nWith a certain skill, Mr. Seward packs together high-sounding words,\r\nbut these his phrases, are cold and hollow. Mr. Seward begins by\r\nsaying that the people are to confer upon him the highest honors.\r\nMr. Seward enlightens, and, so to speak, _pedagogues_ the people\r\nconcerning what everybody ought to sacrifice. The twenty-two\r\nmillions of people have already sacrificed every thing, and\r\nsacrificed it without being doctrined by you, O, great patriot! and\r\nyou, great patriot, you have hitherto sacrificed NOTHING!\r\n\r\nLet Mr. Seward show his patriotic record! To his ambition,\r\nselfishness, ignorance and innate insincerity he has sacrificed as\r\nmuch of the people's honor, of the people's interests, and of the\r\npeople's blood as was feasible. History cannot be cheated. History\r\nwill compare Mr. Seward's manifestoes and phrases with his actions!\r\n\r\n_March 8._--The cavalry horses look as if they came from Egypt\r\nduring the seven years' famine. I inquired the reason from different\r\nsoldiers and officers of various regiments. Nine-tenths of them\r\nagreed that the horses scarcely receive half the ration of oats and\r\nhay allotted to them by the government. Somebody steals the other\r\nhalf, but every body is satisfied. All this could very easily be\r\nferreted out, but it seems that no will exists any where to bring\r\nthe thieves to punishment.\r\n\r\n_March 8._--During weeks and weeks I watched McDowell's inquiry.\r\nWhat an honest and straight-forward man is Sigel. McDowell would\r\nmake an excellent criminal lawyer. McDowell is the most cunning to\r\ncross-examine; he would shine among all criminal catchers. The\r\nKnow-Nothing West Point hatred is stirred up against Sigel. I was\r\nmost positively assured that at Pea Ridge a West Point drunkard and\r\ngeneral expressly fired his batteries in Sigel's rear, to throw\r\nSigel's troops into disorder and disgrace. But in the fire Sigel\r\ncannot be disgraced nor confused; so say his soldiers and\r\ncompanions. Sigel would do a great deal of good, but the\r\nKnow-Nothing-West Point-Halleck envy, ignorance and selfishness are\r\ncombined and bitter against Sigel.\r\n\r\nIn this inquiry Sigel proved that he always fought his whole corps\r\nhimself. So do all good commanders; so did Reno, Kearney, so do\r\nHooker, Heintzelman, Rosecrans, and very likely all generals in the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nThe McClellan-Franklin school, and very probably the Simon-pure West\r\nPointers, fight differently. In their opinion, the commander of a\r\ncorps relies on his generals of divisions; these on the generals of\r\nbrigades, who, in their turn rely on colonels, and thus any kind of\r\n_ensemble_ disappears. Of course exceptions exist, but in general\r\nour battles seem to be fought by regiments and by colonels. O West\r\nPoint! At the last Bull Run two days' battles, McDowell fought his\r\ncorps in the West Point-McClellan fashion. His own statements show\r\nthat his corps was scattered, that he had it not in hand, that he\r\neven knew not where the divisions of his corps were located; and\r\nduring the night of 29-30, he, McDowell, after wandering about\r\nthe field in search of his corps, spent that night bivouacking\r\namidst Sigel's corps!\r\n\r\n_March 9._--New York politicians behaved as meanly towards\r\nWadsworth as if they were all from Seward's school.\r\n\r\n_March 9._--Hooker is at the Herculean work of reorganizing the\r\narmy. Those who visited it assert that Hooker is very active, very\r\njust; and that he has already accomplished the magician's work in\r\nintroducing order and changing the spirit of the army. Only some few\r\ninveterate McClellanites and envious, genuine West Pointers are\r\nslandering Hooker.\r\n\r\n_March 12._--Since the adjournment of Congress, everything looks\r\nsluggish and in suspense. The Administration, that is, Mr. Lincoln,\r\nis at work preparing measures, etc., to carry out the laws of\r\nCongress; Mr. Seward is at work to baffle them; Blair is going over\r\nto border-State policy; Stanton, firm, as of old; so is Welles;\r\nBates recognises good principles, but is afraid to see such\r\nprinciples at once brought to light; Chase makes bonds and notes. We\r\nshall see what will come from all these preparations. But for\r\nCongress, Lincoln or the executive, would have been disabled from\r\nexecuting the laws. Congress, by its laws or statutes, aided the\r\nExecutive branch in its _sworn duty_.\r\n\r\n_March 13._--The various Chambers of Commerce petition and ask that\r\nthe president may issue letters of marque. It is to be supposed, or\r\nrather to be admitted, that the Chambers of Commerce know what is\r\nthe best for them, how our commerce is to be protected, how the\r\nrebel pirates swept from the oceans, and how England, treacherous\r\nEngland, perfidious Albion, be punished. But Sumner--of\r\ncourse--knows better than our Chambers of Commerce, and our\r\ncommercial marine; with all his little might, Sumner opposes what\r\nthe country's interests demand, and demand urgently. I am sure that\r\nalready this general demonstration of the national wish and will,\r\nthe demonstrations made by our Chambers of Commerce, etc., will\r\nimpress England, or at least the English supporters of piracy.\r\n\r\nSumner will believe that his letters to English old women will\r\nchange the minds of the English semi-pirates. Sumner is a little\r\nafraid of losing ground with the English guardians of civilization.\r\nSumner is full of good wishes, of generous conceptions, and is the\r\nman for the millennium. Sumner lacks the keen, sharp, piercing\r\nappreciation of common events. And thus Sumner cannot detect that\r\nEngland makes war on our commerce, under the piratic flag of the\r\nrebels.\r\n\r\n_March 14._--The primitive Christians scarcely had more terrible\r\nenemies, scarcely had to overcome greater impediments, than are\r\nopposed to the principle of human rights, and of emancipation. All\r\nthat is the meanest, the most degraded, the most dastardly and the\r\nmost treacherous, is combined against us. Many of the former\r\nconfessors, many of our friends, many, unconscious of it--_Sewardise_\r\nand _Blairise_.\r\n\r\nMud is stirred up, flows, rises and penetrates in all directions.\r\nThe _Cloaca Maxima_ in Rome, during thirty centuries scarcely\r\ncarried more filth than is here besieging, storming the\r\ndepartments, all the administrative issues, and all the so-called\r\npolitical issues.\r\n\r\nI am sure that the enemies of emancipation, that Seward, Weed, etc.,\r\nwait for some great victory, for the fall of Vicksburgh or of\r\nCharleston, to renew their efforts to pacify, to unite, to kiss the\r\nhands of traitors, and to save slavery. I see positive indications\r\nof it. Seward expects in 1864 to ride into the White House on such\r\nreconciliation. What a good time then for the Weeds, and for all the\r\nSewardites!\r\n\r\n_March 15._--Persons who seemed well informed, assured me that Weed\r\ngot hold of Stanton, and secretly presides over the contracts in the\r\nWar Department. If so, it is very secretly done; as I investigated,\r\ntraced it, and found out nothing. At any rate, Weed would never get\r\nat a Watson, a man altogether independent of any political\r\ninfluences. Watson is the incarnation of honest and intelligent\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nWilkes' _Spirit of the Times_ is unrelenting in its haughty\r\nindependence. It is the only public organ in this country of like\r\ncharacter; at least I know not another.\r\n\r\n_March 15._--It is so saddening to witness how all kinds of\r\nincapacities, stupidities, how meanness, hollowness, heartlessness,\r\nall incarnated in politicians, in trimmers, in narrow brained; how\r\nall of them ride on the shoulders of the masses, and use them for\r\ntheir sordid, mean, selfish and ambitious ends. And the masses are\r\nsuperior to those riders in everything constituting manhood, honesty\r\nand intellect!\r\n\r\n_March 16._--Halleck wrote a letter to Rosecrans, explaining how to\r\ndeal with all kinds of treason, and with all kinds of traitors. It\r\nlooks as if Halleck improved, and tried to become energetic. What is\r\nin the wind? Is Mr. Lincoln becoming seriously serious?\r\n\r\n_March 16._--Genuine, social and practical freedom, is generated by\r\nindividual rational freedom. If a man cannot, or even worse, if a\r\nman understands not to act as a free rational being in every daily\r\ncircumstance of life during the week, then he cannot understand to\r\nbehave on Sunday as a free man; and act as a free man in all his\r\npolitical and social relations and duties. The North upholds that\r\nlaw of freedom against the slavocracy, and fights to carry and\r\nestablish a genuine social organism where at present barbarity,\r\noppression, lawlessness and recklessness, prevail and preside.\r\n\r\n_March 18._--I sent Hooker Schalk's _Summary of the Science of War_.\r\nIt is the best, the clearest handbook ever published. About six\r\nmonths ago, when Banks commanded the defenses of Washington, I\r\nsuggested to him to try and get Schalk into head-quarters, or into\r\nthe staff. The ruling powers proffered to Schalk to make him captain\r\nat large, and this was proffered at a time when altogether\r\nunmilitary men became colonels, etc., at the head-quarters. I never\r\nmyself saw Schalk, but he refused the offer, as years ago he was a\r\ncaptain in the Austrian army, is independent, and knows his own\r\nvalue. Any European government, above all when having on hand a\r\ngreat war, with both hands with military grades, would seize upon a\r\ncapacity such as Schalk's. Here they know better. My hobby is that\r\nthe president be surrounded by a genuine staff composed either of\r\nGeneral Butler or any other capable American general, of Sigel, of\r\nSchalk, and of a few more American officers, who easily could\r\norganise a staff, _un état Major général_, such as all European\r\ngovernments have. But West Point wisdom, engineers and routine,\r\nkill, murder, throttle, everything beyond their reach, and thus\r\nmurder the people.\r\n\r\n_March 20._--Every week Mr. Seward pours over the fated country his\r\ncold, shallow Union rhetoric. But whoever reads it feels that all\r\nthis combined phraseology gushes not from a patriotic heart; every\r\none detects therein bids for the next Presidency.\r\n\r\nGold is at fifty-five per cent here; in Richmond, gold is four to\r\nsix hundred per cent. The money bags, and all those who adjust the\r\naffairs of the world to the rise and to the fall of all kind of\r\nexchanges, they may base their calculations on the above figures,\r\nand find out who has more chances of success, the rebels or we!\r\n\r\nMud, stench on the increase, and because I see, smell and feel it,\r\n\"_My friends scorn me, but my eye poureth =tears= into_\" [Psalm] the\r\nnoble American people.\r\n\r\n_March 21._--The _honest_ Conservatives and the small church of\r\nabolitionists are equally narrow-minded, and abuse the last\r\nCongress. The one and the other comprehend not, and cannot\r\ncomprehend the immense social and historical signification of the\r\nlast Congress. It made me almost sick to find Edward Everett joining\r\nin the chorus. But he, too, is growing very old.\r\n\r\n_March 22._--What are generally called excellent authorities assert\r\nthat an offensive and defensive alliance is concluded between Seward\r\nand Stanton. Further, I am told, that Senator Morgan, Thurlow Weed,\r\nand a certain Whiting, a new star on the politician's horizon, have\r\nbeen the attorneys of the two contracting powers. I cannot yet\r\ndetect any signs of such an alliance, and disbelieve the story. A\r\nshort time will be necessary to see its fruits. Until I see I\r\nwait!... But were it true? Who will be taken in? I am sure it will\r\nnot be Seward. Is Stanton dragged down by the infuriated fates?\r\n\r\n_March 23._--Burnside is to save Kentucky, almost lost by Halleck\r\nand Buell. Congress adjourned, and no investigation was made into\r\nHalleck's conduct after Corinth in 1862. The Western army\r\ndisappeared; Buell commanded in Kentucky, and rebels, guerillas,\r\ncut-throats, murderers and thieves overflow the west, menaced\r\nCincinnati. And all this when the Secretary of War in his report\r\nspeaks about eight hundred thousand men in the field. But the\r\nSecretary of War provides men and means; great Lincoln, the still\r\ngreater Halleck distribute and use them. This explains all. Burnside\r\nis honest and loyal, only give him no army to command. I deeply\r\nregret that Burnside's honesty squares not at all with his military\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nThe Government is at a loss what to do with honest, ignorant,\r\nuseless military big men, who in some way or other rose above their\r\ncongenial but very low level. Already last year I suggested (in\r\nwriting) to Stanton to gather together such intellectual military\r\ninvalids and to establish an honorary military council, to counsel\r\nnothing. Occasionally such a council could direct various\r\ninvestigations, give its advice about shoes, pants, horses and\r\nhorse-shoes. Something like such council really exists in Russia,\r\nand I pointed it out to Stanton for imitation.\r\n\r\n_March 25._--Stanton scorns the slander concerning his alliance with\r\nSeward and Weed. It is an invention of Blair, and based on the fact\r\nthat Stanton sides with Seward in the question _of letters of\r\nmarque_, opposed by Blair under the influence of Sumner the\r\nciviliser. I believe Stanton, and not my former informer.\r\n\r\n_Halleckiana._ This great, unequalled great man declared that \"it\r\nwere better even to send McClellan to Kentucky, or to the West, than\r\nto send there Fremont, as Fremont would at once free the niggers.\"\r\n\r\nThe admirers of poor argument, of spread-eagleism, and of ignorant\r\nquotations stolen from history, make a fuss about Mr. Seward's State\r\npapers. The good in these papers is where Mr. Seward, in his\r\nconfused phraseology, re-echoes the will, the decision of the\r\npeople, no longer to be humbugged by England's perversion of\r\ninternational laws and of the rights and duties of neutrals; the\r\nwill of the people sooner or later to take England to account. (I\r\nhope it will be done, and no English goods will ever pollute the\r\nAmerican soil. It will be the best vengeance.) The repudiation of\r\nany mediation is in the marrow of the people, and Seward's muddy\r\narguments only perverted and weakened it. In Europe, the substance\r\nof Seward's dispatch, is considered the passage where Seward's\r\nhighfalutin logomachy offers to the rebels their vacant seats in the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n_March 26._--Had we generals, the rebel army in Virginia ought to\r\nhave been dispersed and destroyed after the first Bull Run:\r\n\r\nA. McCLELLAN.--Any day in November and December, 1861.\r\n\r\nB. McCLELLAN.--Any day in January and February, 1862, at\r\nCenterville, Manassas.\r\n\r\nC.

But for the wailings of McClellan and his stick-in-the-mud\r\ndo-nothing strategy, McDowell, Banks and Fremont would have marched\r\nto Richmond from north, north-west, and west, when we already\r\nreached Stanton, and could take Gordonsville.\r\n\r\nG.

McCLELLAN.--After Antietam battle, won by Hooker, and above all\r\nby the indomitable bravery of the soldiers and officers, and not by\r\nMcClellan's generalship, Lee ought to have been followed and thrown\r\ninto the Potomac.\r\n\r\nK. McCLELLAN.--Lay for weeks idle at Harper's Ferry, gave Lee time\r\nto reorganize his army and to take positions. Elections.\r\nCopperheads, French mediation.\r\n\r\nL.

HALLECK, MEIGS, etc. The affair of the pontoons.\r\n\r\nP. BURNSIDE, _Franklin_.--The attack of the Fredericksburg Heights.\r\n\r\n_March 28._--From the day of Sumter, and when the Massachusetts men\r\nhurrying to the defence of the Union, were murdered by the Southern\r\n_gentlemen_ in Baltimore, this struggle in reality is carried on\r\nbetween the Southern gentlemen, backed by abettors in the North,\r\n(abettors existing even in our army,) all of them united against the\r\nYANKEE, who incarnates civilization, right, liberty, intellectual\r\nsuperior development, and therefore is hated by the _gentleman_--this\r\ngenuine Southern growth embodying darkness, violence, and all the\r\nvirtues highly prized in hell. The Yankee, that is, the intelligent,\r\nlaborious inhabitant of New England and of the Northern villages and\r\ntowns, represents the highest civilization: the best _Southern\r\ngentleman_, that lord of plantations, that cotton, tobacco and\r\nslavemonger, at the best is somewhat polished, varnished; the varnish\r\ncovers all kinds of barbarity and of rottenness. It is to be regretted\r\nthat our army contains officers modelled on the Southern\r\npattern, to whom human rights and civilization are as distasteful as\r\nthey are to any high-toned slave-whipper in the South.\r\n\r\n_March 29._--The destruction of slavery, the triumph of self\r\ngovernment ought not to be the only fruit of this war. The\r\npolitician ought to be buried in the offal of the war. The crushing\r\nof politicians is a question as vital as the crushing of the\r\nrebellion and of treason. All the politicians are a nuisance, a\r\ncurse, a plague worse than was any in Egypt. All of them are equal,\r\nbe they Thurlow Weeds or Forneys, or etc. etc. etc. A better and\r\npurer race of leaders of the people will, I hope, be born from this\r\nterrible struggle. Were I a stump speaker I should day and night\r\ncampaign against the politician, that luxuriant and poisonous weed\r\nin the American Eden.\r\n\r\n_March 30._--Glorious news from Hooker's army. Even the most\r\ninveterate McClellanites admire his activity and indeed are\r\nastonished to what degree Hooker has recast, reinvigorated, purified\r\nthe spirit of the army. To reorganise a demoralised army requires\r\nmore nerve than to win a battle. Hooker takes care of the soldiers.\r\nAnd now I hope that Hooker, having reorganised the army, will not\r\nkeep it idly in camp, but move, and strike and crush the traitors.\r\nHooker! _En avant! marchons!_\r\n\r\n_March 31._--Some newspapers in New York and the National\r\nIntelligencer here in Washington, the paid organ of Seward and\r\nlikewise organ of treason gilded by Unionism--all of them begin to\r\ndiscuss the necessity of a staff. All of them reveal a West Point\r\nknowledge of the subject; and the staff which they demand or which\r\nthey would organise, would be not a bit better than the existing\r\nones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL, 1863.\r\n\r\n     Lord Lyons -- Blue book -- Diplomats -- Butler -- Franklin --\r\n     Bancroft -- Homunculi -- Fetishism -- Committee on the Conduct of\r\n     the War -- Non-intercourse -- Peterhoff -- Sultan's Firman --\r\n     Seward -- Halleck -- Race -- Capua -- Feint -- Letter writing --\r\n     England -- Russia -- American Revolution -- Renovation -- Women\r\n     -- Monroe doctrine, etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April 1._--The English Blue Book reveals the fact that Lord Lyons\r\nheld meetings and semi-official, or if one will, unofficial _talks_\r\nwith what he calls \"the leaders of the Conservatives in New York;\"\r\nthat is, with the leaders of the Copperheads, and of the slavery and\r\nrebellion saviours. The Despatches of Lord Lyons prove how difficult\r\nit is to become familiar with the public spirit in this country,\r\neven for a cautious, discreet diplomat and an Englishman. But\r\nperhaps we should say, _because_ an Englishman, Lord Lyons became\r\nconfused. Lord Lyons took for reality a bubble emanating from a\r\nputrescent fermentation. I am at a loss to understand why Earl\r\nRussell divulged the above mentioned correspondence, thus putting\r\nLord Lyons into a false and unpleasant position with the party in\r\npower.\r\n\r\nAs for the fact itself, it is neither new nor unwonted. Diplomacy\r\nand diplomats meddle with all parties; they do it openly or\r\nsecretly, according to circumstances. English diplomacy was always\r\nforemost in meddling, and above all it has been so during this whole\r\ncentury. The English diplomat is not yet born, who will not meddle\r\nor intrigue with all kinds of parties, either in a nation, in a body\r\npolitic, in a cabinet or at court.\r\n\r\nWhen a nation, a dynasty, a government becomes entangled in domestic\r\ntroubles, the first thing they have to do is to politely bow out of\r\nthe country all the foreign diplomacy and diplomats, be these\r\ndiplomats hostile, indifferent, or even friendly. And the longer a\r\ndiplomat has resided in a country, the more absolutely he ought to\r\nbe bowed out with his other colleagues; to bow them all in or back,\r\nwhen the domestic struggle is finished.\r\n\r\nHistory bristles with evidences of the meddling of diplomats with\r\npolitical parties, and bears evidence of the mischief done, and of\r\nthe fatal misfortunes accruing to a country that is victimised by\r\nforeign diplomacy and by diplomats. Without ransacking history so\r\nfar back as to the treaty of Vienna, (1815) look to Spain, above\r\nall, during Isabella I.'s minority, to Greece, to Turkey, etc. And\r\nunder my eyes, Mexico is killed by diplomacy and by diplomats.\r\n\r\nDiplomatic meddlings become the more dangerous when no court exists\r\nthat might more or less control them, to impress on them a certain\r\ncurb in their semi-official and non-official conduct. But at times\r\nit is difficult, even to a sovereign, to a court, to keep in order\r\nthe intriguing diplomats, above all to keep them at bay in their\r\nsemi-official social relations.\r\n\r\nIn principle, and _de facto_, a diplomat, and principally a diplomat\r\nrepresenting a powerful sovereign or nation, has no, or very few,\r\nprivate, inoffensive, social, worldly, parlor relations in the\r\ncountry, or in the place to which he is appointed, and where he\r\nresides. Every action, step, relation, intimacy of a diplomat has a\r\nsignification, and is watched by very argus-like eyes; alike by the\r\ngovernment to which he is accredited, and by his colleagues, most of\r\nwhom are also his rivals. Not even the Jesuits watch each other more\r\nvigilantly, and denounce each other more pitilessly, than do the\r\ndiplomats--officially, semi-officially and privately.\r\n\r\nIt requires great tact in a diplomat to bring into harmony his\r\nofficial and his social, and non-official conduct. Lord Lyons\r\ngenerally showed this tact and adroitly avoided the breakers. At\r\ntimes such want of harmony is apparent and is the result of the\r\nwill, or of the principles of the court and of the sovereign\r\nrepresented by a diplomat. Thus, after the revolution of July, 1830,\r\nthe sovereign and the diplomats in the Holy Alliance, of Russia,\r\nAustria, and Prussia recognised Louis Phillipe's royalty as a fact\r\nbut not as a principle. Therefore, in their social relations the\r\nAmbassadors of Russia, Austria, and Prussia, most emphatically sided\r\nwith the Carlists, the most bitter and unrelenting enemies of the\r\nOrleans and of the order of things inaugurated by the revolution of\r\nJuly, and Carlists always crowded the saloons of the Holy Alliance's\r\ndiplomats. The Duke d'Orleans, Louis Phillipe's son, scarcely dared\r\nto enter the brilliant, highly aristocratic, and purely legitimist\r\nsaloon of the Countess Appony, wife of the Austrian Ambassador. Of\r\ncourse the conduct of the Count and Countess was approved, and\r\napplauded, in Vienna. But at times, for some reason or other, a\r\ndiplomat puts in contradiction his official and non-official\r\nconduct, and does it not only without instructions or approval of\r\nhis sovereign and government, but in contradiction to the intentions\r\nof his master and in contradiction to the prevailing opinion of his\r\ncountry. And thus it happens, that a diplomat presents to a\r\ngovernment in trouble the most sincere and the most cheering\r\nofficial expressions of sympathy from his master; and with the same\r\nhand the diplomat gives the heartiest shakes to the most unrelenting\r\nenemies of the same government.\r\n\r\nThe Russian, skillful, shrewd and proud diplomacy, generally holds\r\nan independent, almost an isolated position from England and from\r\nFrance. The Russian diplomacy goes its own way, at times joined or\r\njoining according to circumstances, but never, never following in\r\nthe wake of the two rival powers. During this our war, and doubtless\r\nfor the first time since Russian diplomacy has existed, a Russian\r\ndiplomat semi and non-officially, seemingly, limped after the\r\ndiplomats of England and of France. But such a diplomatic _mistake_\r\ncan not last long.\r\n\r\n_April 2._--Official, lordish, Toryish England, plays treason and\r\ninfamy right and left. The English money lenders to rebels, the\r\ngenuine owners of rebel piratical ships, are anxious to destroy the\r\nAmerican commerce and to establish over the South an English\r\nmonopoly. All this because _odiunt dum metuant_ the Yankee. You\r\ntories, you enemies of freedom, your time of reckoning will come,\r\nand it will come at the hands of your own people. You fear the\r\nexample of America for your oppressions, for your rent-rolls.\r\n\r\n_April 3._--The country ought to have had already about one hundred\r\nthousand Africo-Americans, either under arms, in the field, or\r\ndrilling in camps. But to-day Lincoln has not yet brought together\r\nmore than ten to fifteen thousand in the field; and what is done, is\r\ndone rather, so to speak, by private enterprise than by the\r\nGovernment. Mr. Lincoln hesitates, meditates, and shifts, instead of\r\ngoing to work manfully, boldly, and decidedly. Every time an\r\nAfrico-American regiment is armed or created, Mr. Lincoln seems as\r\nthough making an effort, or making a gracious concession in\r\npermitting the increase of our forces. It seems as if Mr. Lincoln\r\nwere ready to exhaust all the resources of the country before he\r\nboldly strikes the Africo American vein. How differently the whole\r\naffair should have been conducted!\r\n\r\n_April 4._--Almost every day I hear very intelligent and patriotic\r\nmen wonder why every thing is going on so undecidedly, so\r\nsluggishly; and all of them, in their despondency, dare not or will\r\nnot ascend to the cause. And when they finally see where the fault\r\nlies, they are still more desponding.\r\n\r\nEurope, that is, European statesmen, judge the country, the people,\r\nby its leaders and governors. European statesmen judge the events by\r\nthe turn given to them by a Lincoln, a Seward; this furnishes an\r\nexplanation of many of the misdeeds committed by English and French\r\nstatesmen.\r\n\r\n_April 4._--The people at large, with indomitable activity, mends,\r\nrepairs the disasters resulting from the inability and the\r\nselfishness of its official chiefs. One day, however, the people\r\nwill turn its eyes and exclaim:\r\n\r\n\"_But thou, O God! shalt bring them down into the pit of\r\ndestruction; bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their\r\ndays._\"\r\n\r\n_April 4._--General Butler's speech in New York, at the Academy of\r\nMusic, is the best, nay, is the paramount exposition of the whole\r\nrebellion in its social, governmental and military aspects. No\r\nPresident's Message, no letter, no one of the emanations of Seward's\r\nletter and dispatch-writing, corrosive disease, not an article in any\r\npress compares with Butler's speech for lucidity, logic, conciseness\r\nand strong reasoning. Butler laid down a law, a doctrine--and what he\r\nlays down as such, contains more cardinal truth and reason than all\r\nthat was ever uttered by the Administration. And Butler is shelved and\r\nbartered to France by Seward as long since as 1862; and the people\r\nbear it, and the great clear-sighted press subsides, instead of day\r\nand night battering the Administration for pushing aside the _only\r\nman_, emphatically the ONLY MAN who was always and everywhere equal to\r\nevery emergency--who never was found amiss, and who never forgot that\r\nan abyss separates the condition of a rebel, be he armed or unarmed,\r\n(the second even more dangerous,) from a loyal citizen and from the\r\nloyal Government.\r\n\r\n_April 4._--The annals of the Navy during this war will constitute a\r\ncheering and consoling page for any future historian. If the Navy at\r\ntimes is unsuccessful, the want of success can be traced to\r\naltogether different reasons than many of the disasters on land.\r\nNothing similar to McClellanism pollutes the Navy--and want of\r\nvigilance and other mistakes become virtues when compared with want\r\nof convictions, with selfishness, and with intrigue. I have not yet\r\nheard any justified complaint against the honesty of the Navy\r\nDepartment; I feel so happy not to be disappointed in the tars of\r\nall grades, and that Neptune Welles, with his Fox, (but not a\r\nred-haired, thieving fox,) keep steady, clean, and as active as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n_April 5._--Senator Sumner pines and laments, Jeremiah-like, on the\r\nruins of our foreign policy, and accuses Seward of it--behind his\r\nback. Why has not _pater conscriptus_ uttered a single word of\r\ncondemnation from his Senatorial _fauteuil_, and kept mute during\r\nthree sessions? _Sunt nobis homunculi sed non homines._\r\n\r\n_April 5._--A letter in the papers, in all probability written under\r\nthe eye of General Franklin, tries to exculpate the General from all\r\nthe blood spilt at Fredericksburgh. It will not do, although the\r\nwriter has in his hands documents, as orders, etc. Franklin orders\r\nGeneral Meade to attack the enemy's lines at the head of 4500 men,\r\n(he ought to have given to Meade at least double that number); brave\r\nand undaunted Meade breaks through the enemy; and Franklin's excuse\r\nfor not supporting Meade is, that he had no orders from\r\nhead-quarters to do it. By God! Those geniuses, West Point No. Ones,\r\nsuppose that any dust can be thrown to cover their nameless--at the\r\nbest--helplessness. Franklin commanded a whole wing, sixty thousand\r\nmen; his part in the battle was the key to the whole attack.\r\nFranklin's eventual success must decide the day. Meade was in\r\nFranklin's command, and to support Meade, Franklin wants an order\r\nfrom head-quarters. Such an excuse made by a general at the head of\r\na large part of the army--or rather such a crime not to support a\r\npart of his own command engaged with the enemy, because no special\r\norders from head-quarters prescribed his doing so--such a case or\r\nexcuse is almost unexampled in the history of warfare. And when such\r\ncases happened, then the guilty was not long kept in command. Three\r\nbloody groans for Franklin!\r\n\r\n_April 6._--George Bancroft has the insight of a genuine historian.\r\nFew men, if any, can be compared to him for the clearness, breadth,\r\nand justness with which in this war Bancroft comprehends and\r\nembraces events and men. Bancroft's judgment is almost faultless,\r\nand it is to be regretted that Bancroft, so to speak, is outside of\r\nthe circle instead of being inside, and in some way among the\r\npilots.\r\n\r\n_April 6._--The Report of the Committee on the Conduct of the War\r\nwill make the coming generation and the future historian shudder. No\r\none will be able to comprehend how such a McClellan could have been\r\nthus long kept in the command of an army, and still less how there\r\ncould have existed men claiming to have sound reason and heart, and\r\nconstitute a McClellan party. McClellan is the most disgusting\r\npsychological anomaly. It is an evidence how a mental poison rapidly\r\nspreads and permeates all. As was repeatedly pointed out in this\r\nDIARY, individuals who started the McClellan fetishism, were\r\nadmirers of the _Southern gentlemen_, were worshippers of slavery,\r\nwere secret or open partisans of rebellion. Many such subsequently\r\nappear as Copperheads, peace men, as Union men, as Conservatives.\r\nThe other stratum of McClellanism is composed of intriguers. These\r\ncombined forces, supported by would-be wise ignorance, spread the\r\nworship, and poisoned thousands and tens of thousands of honest but\r\nnot clear-sighted minds. The Report, or rather the investigation was\r\nconducted with the utmost fairness; of course Ben Wade could not act\r\notherwise than fairly and nobly. Some critics say that McClellan's\r\ncase could have been yet more strongly brought out, and the fetish\r\ncould have been shown to the people in his most disgustingly true\r\nnakedness.\r\n\r\n_April 6._--The people feel how the treason of the English\r\nevilwishers slowly extends through its organs. By Butler, Wade,\r\nGrimes and others, the people ask for non-intercourse with the\r\nEnglish assassin, who surreptitiously, stealthily under cover of\r\ndarkness, of legal formality, deals, or attempts to deal, a deadly\r\nblow. The American sentimentalists strain to the utmost their soft\r\nbrains, to find excuses for English treason.\r\n\r\nEnglish lordlings, scholars, moralists of the Carlyleian mental\r\nperversion comment Homer, instead of being clear sighted\r\ncommentators of what passes under their noses. The English\r\nphrase-mongering philanthropists all with joy smacked their bloody\r\nlips at the, by them ardently wished and expected downfall of a\r\nnoble, free and self-governing people. Tigers, hyenas and jackals!\r\nclatter your teeth, smack your lips! but you shall not get at the\r\nprey.\r\n\r\n_April 7._--The President visits the Potomac army at Falmouth.\r\nSeward wished to be of the party, offering to make a stirring speech\r\nto the soldiers--that is, to impress the heroes with the notion that\r\nin Seward they beheld a still greater hero, a patriot reeking with\r\nUnionism and sacrifices, and eventually prepare their votes for the\r\nnext presidential election. Certain influences took the wind out of\r\nSeward's sails, and as a naughty, arrogant boy, he was left behind\r\nto bite his nails, and to pour out a logomachy.\r\n\r\n_April 7._--I am very uneasy about Charleston. It seems that\r\nsomething works foul. Either they have not men enough, or brains\r\nenough. A good artillerist, having confidence in the guns, and\r\nhaving the needed insight how and where to use them, ought to\r\ncommand our forces. Will the iron-clads resist the concentric fire\r\nfrom so numerous batteries?\r\n\r\nThe diplomats of the _prospective mediation_ and their tails are\r\nscared by the elections in Connecticut. Others, however, of that\r\nillustrious European body are out-spoken friends of Union and of\r\nfreedom. The representatives of the American republics are to be\r\nrelied upon. St. Domingo, Mexico sufficiently teaches all races,\r\n_latin_ (_?_) as well as non-latin, that honey-mouthed governmental\r\nEurope is an all-devouring wolf under a sheep's skin.\r\n\r\nNon-intercourse! no intercourse with England and with France as\r\nlong as France chooses to be ridden by the _Decembriseur_! Such\r\nought to be the watchword for a long, long time to come.\r\n\r\n_April 8._--The New York _Times_ is now boiling with patriotic wrath\r\nagainst McClellan. Very well. But when McClellan captured maple guns\r\nat Centerville and Manassas, when he digged mud and graves for our\r\nsoldiers before Yorktown, and in the Chickahominy, the _Times_ was\r\nextatic beyond measure and description, extatic over the matured\r\nplans, the gigantic strategy of McClellan--and at that epoch the\r\n_Times_ powerfully contributed to confuse the public opinion.\r\n\r\n_April 8._--A Mr. Ockford, (or of similar name,) who for many years,\r\nwas a ship broker in England, advised our government and above all,\r\nMr. Seward, to institute proceedings before the English courts\r\nagainst the building and arming of the iron-clads for the rebels.\r\nSeward, of course, snubbed him off with the Sewardian verdict that\r\nthe jury in England will give or pronounce no verdict of guilty, in\r\nour favor, as our jury would not find any one guilty of treason.\r\nGood for a Seward.\r\n\r\nPatriots from various States, among them Boutwell, now member of\r\nCongress from Massachusetts, urged the Cabinet; 1st, to declare\r\nperemptorily to the English Government that if the rebel iron-clads\r\nare allowed to go out from English ports, our government will\r\nconsider it as being a deliberate and willful act of hostility; 2d,\r\nto publish at once the above declaration, that the English people\r\nat large may judge of the affair. Seward opposed such a bold\r\nstep--Sumner ditto.\r\n\r\n_April 9._--I am at a loss to find in history, any government\r\nwhatever that so little took or takes into account the intrinsic and\r\nintellectual fitness of an individual for the office entrusted to\r\nhim, as does the government of Mr. Lincoln. I cannot imagine that it\r\ncould have been always so, under previous administrations. It seems\r\nthat in the opinion of the Executive, not only geniuses, but men of\r\nstudies, and of special and specific preparation and knowledge run\r\nin the streets, crowd the villages and states, and the Executive has\r\nonly to stretch his hand from the window, to take hold of an\r\nunmistakable capacity, etc. The Executive ought to have some\r\nexperience by this time; but alas, _experientia non docet_ in the\r\nWhite House.\r\n\r\n_April 10._--Agitated as my existence has been, I never fell among\r\nso much littleness, meanness, servility as here. To avoid it, and\r\nnot to despair, or rage, or despond, several times a day, it is\r\nnecessary to avoid contact with politicians, and reduce to few, very\r\nfew, all intercourse with them. I cannot complain, as I find\r\ncompensation--but nevertheless, I am afraid that the study and the\r\nanalysis of so much mud and offal may tell upon me. Physical\r\nmonstrosities are attractive to physiologists or rather to\r\npathologists. But an anthropologist prefers normal nobleness of\r\nmind, and shudders at sight and contact with intellectual and moral\r\ncrookedness.\r\n\r\n_April 11._--Sumter day. Two years elapsed, and treason not yet\r\ncrushed; Charleston not yet ploughed over and sown with salt;\r\nBeauregard still in command, and the snake still keeping at bay the\r\neagle. And all this because in December, 1861, and in January, 1862,\r\nMcClellan wished not, Seward wished not, and Mr. Lincoln could not\r\ndecide whether to wish that Charleston and Savannah--defenceless at\r\nthat time--be taken after the fall of Port Royal. Two years! and the\r\npeople still bleed, and the exterminating angel strikes not the\r\nmalefactors, and the earth bursts not, and they are not yet in\r\nGehenna's embrace.\r\n\r\nOld patriot Everett made an uncompromising speech. That is by far\r\nbetter than to make a hero out of a McClellan. But the misdeeds of\r\nthe Administration easily confused such impressionable receptive\r\nminds as is Edward Everett's.\r\n\r\n_April 11._--The Report of the Committee on the Conduct of the War,\r\ndiscloses how McClellan deliberately ruined General Stone, and I\r\nhave little doubt that McClellan ruined Fitz-John Porter.\r\n\r\n_April 12._--Our navy makes brilliant prizes of Anglo-rebel flags\r\nand ships. But Mr. Seward does his utmost to render the labor of our\r\ncruisers as difficult and as dangerous as possible. Of course he\r\ndoes it not intentionally, only because he so _masterly masters_ the\r\ninternational laws, the laws and rules of search, the rights and\r\nduties of neutrals, etc., and as a genuine incarnation of _fiat\r\njustitia_, he is indifferent to national interests and to the\r\nnational flag.\r\n\r\nI am curious to learn whether the truth will ever be generally known\r\nconcerning the seizure of the Anglo-rebel steamer Peterhoff. Then\r\nthe people would learn how old Welles bravely defended what _turpe_\r\nSeward had decided to drag in the mire. The people would learn what\r\nan utterly ignorant impudence presided over the restoring to England\r\nof the Peterhoff's mail bag of a vessel a contrabandist, a blockade\r\nrunner, and a forger. The people would know how Mr. Seward, aided by\r\nMr. Lincoln, has done all in his power to make impossible the\r\ncondemnation of the Anglo-rebel property. The people would know how\r\n_turpe_ Seward tried to urge and to persuade Neptune Welles to\r\nviolate the statutes of the country; how the great Secretary of\r\nState declared that he cared very little for law, and how he and\r\nLincoln, by a Sultan's firman, directed the decision of the Judge on\r\nhis bench.\r\n\r\n_April 14._--My gloomy forebodings about the attack on Charleston\r\nare already partly realized. Beaten off! that is the short solution\r\nof a long story. But of course nobody will be at fault. This attack\r\non Charleston to some extent justifies: _parturiunt montes_, etc.\r\n\r\n_De profundis clamavi_ for light and some inklings of sense and\r\nenergy. But to search for sense and energy among counterfeits!...\r\nThe condition here vividly brings to mind Ovid's\r\n\r\n  ...... ...... quem dixere chaos!\r\n\r\n_April 14._--In a letter to the Loyal League of New York, Mr. Seward\r\nis out with his--at least--one hundred and fiftieth prophecy. As\r\nfate finds a particular pleasure in quickly giving the lie to the\r\ninspired prophet, so we have the affair of Charleston, and some\r\nother small disasters. Oh, why has Congress forgotten to pass a law\r\nforbidding Seward, for decency's sake, to make himself ridiculous?\r\nAmong others, hear the following query: _Whether this unconquerable\r\nand irresistible nation shall suddenly perish through imbecility?_\r\netc. O Mr. Seward! how can you thus pointedly and mercilessly\r\ncriticise your own deeds and policy? Seward squints toward the\r\npresidency that he may complete that masterly production.\r\n\r\nOh! how the old hacks turn their dizzy heads towards the White\r\nHouse. It would be ludicrous, and the lowest comedy of life, were\r\nnot the track running through blood and among corpses. I am told\r\nthat even Halleck squints that way. And why not? All is possible;\r\nand Halleck's nag has as long ears as have the nags and hacks of the\r\nother race-runners.\r\n\r\n_April 14._--Halleck consolidates the regiments and incidentally\r\ndeprives the army of the best and most experienced officers. The\r\nnumerically smaller regiment is dissolved in the larger one. But\r\nmost generally the smaller regiment was the bravest and has seen\r\nmore fire which melted it. Thus good officers are mustered out and\r\nthrown on the pavement, and the enthusiasm for the flag of the\r\nregiment destroyed, for its victorious memories, for the\r\nrecollections of common hardships and all the like noble cements of\r\na military life. Certainly, great difficulty exists to remount or to\r\nrestore a regiment. But O, Hallecks! O, Thomases! O, McDowells! all\r\nof you, genii, or genuises, surmount difficulties.\r\n\r\n_April 14._--In a public speech in New York, General Fremont has\r\nexplained the duty and the obligations of a soldier in a republic.\r\nFew, very few, of our striped and starred citizens, and still less\r\nthose educated at West Point have a comprehension of what a\r\nRepublican citizen soldier is.\r\n\r\n_April 14._--Halleck directly and indirectly exercises a fatal\r\ninfluence on our army. I learn that his book on military not-science\r\nlargely circulates; above all, in the Potomac Army.\r\n\r\n_April 14._--It is the mission of the American people to make all\r\nthe trials and experiences by which all other nations will hereafter\r\nprofit. So the social experiment of self-government; the same with\r\nvarious mechanical and commercial inventions. The Americans\r\nexperiment in political and domestic economy, in the art provided\r\nfor man's well-being and in the art of killing him. New fire-arms,\r\nguns, etc., are now first used.\r\n\r\nThe until now undecided question between batteries on land and\r\nfloating ones will be decided in Charleston harbor. Who will have\r\nthe best, the Monitors or the batteries?\r\n\r\n_April 15._--I wrote to Hooker imploring him for the sake of the\r\ncountry, and for the sake of his good name, to put an end to the\r\ncarousings in his camp, and to sweep out all kind of women, be they\r\nwives, sisters, sweethearts or the promiscuous rest of crinolines.\r\n\r\n_April 15._--Certain Republican newspapers perform now the same\r\ncapers to please and puff Seward and Halleck, as they did before to\r\npuff McClellan when in power.\r\n\r\n_April 16._--Night after night the White House is serenaded. And why\r\nnot?... From all sides news of brilliant victories on land and on\r\nsea; news that Seward's foreign policy is successful; everywhere\r\nHalleck's military science carries before it everything, and\r\nlickspittles are numberless.\r\n\r\n    Wild jauchtzend schleudert selbst der Gott der Freude,\r\n  Den Pechkrantz in das brenene Gebaüde!\r\n\r\nMy veins and brains almost bursting to witness all this. But for ...\r\nit would be all over.\r\n\r\n   ... tibi desinet.\r\n\r\n_April 17._--I met one of the best and of the most radical\r\nex-members of Congress. He was very desponding, almost despairing at\r\nthe condition of affairs. He returned from the White House, and\r\nnotwithstanding his despair, tried to explain to me how Mr.\r\nLincoln's eminent and matchless civil and military capacities\r\nfinally will save the country. _Et tu, Brute_, exclaimed I, without\r\nthe classical accent and meaning. The ex-honorable had in his pocket\r\na nomination for an influential office.\r\n\r\n_April 17._--Immense inexhaustible means in men, money, beasts,\r\nequipment, war material devoured and disappearing in the bottomless\r\nabyss of helplessness. The counterfeits ask for more, always for\r\nmore, and more of the high-minded people grudge not its blood.\r\n\r\n  _Labitur ex oculis ... gutta meis._\r\n\r\nA Forney puffs Cameron over Napoleon! A true American gentlewoman as\r\npatriotic as patriotism itself, quivering under the disastrous\r\ncondition of affairs at home and abroad, exclaimed: \"that at least\r\nthe Southern leaders redeem the honor of the American name by their\r\nindomitable bravery, their iron will and their fertility of\r\nresources.\" What was to be answered?\r\n\r\n_April 18._--As long as England is ruled by her aristocracy,\r\nwhether Tories or Whigs, a Hannibalian hate ought to be the creed of\r\nevery American. Let the government of England pass into the hands of\r\nJOHN S. MILL, and into those of the Lancashire working classes, and\r\nthen the two peoples may be friends.\r\n\r\n_April 18._--Hooker is to move. If Hooker brings out the army\r\nvictorious from the bad strategic position wherein the army was put\r\nby Halleck-Burnside, then the people can never sufficiently admire\r\nHooker's genius. Such a manoeuvre will be a revelation.\r\n\r\n_April 18._--I learn that General Hunter has about seven thousand\r\ndisposable men in his whole department, for the attack of\r\nCharleston. If he is to storm the batteries by land, then Hunter has\r\nnot men enough to do it; it is therefore folly and crime to order,\r\nor to allow, the attack of the defenses of Charleston.\r\n\r\n_April 18._--Mr. Seward has not at all given up his firm decision to\r\nviolate the national statutes and the international rules, by\r\ninsisting upon the restoration to England of the mails of that\r\nAnglo-Piratic vessel, the Peterhoff. A mail on a blockade-runner\r\nenjoys no immunity, since regular mail steamers, or at least mail\r\nagents and carriers are established by England. Even previously,\r\nneutral private vessels could not always claim the immunity for the\r\nmail, when they are caught in an unlawful trade. But, of course, the\r\nState Department knows better.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the ship Labuan, an English blockade-runner, Mr.\r\nSeward, backed by Mr. Lincoln, ordered the judge how to decide,\r\nordered the judge to give up the prize, and Mr. Seward urged the\r\nEnglish agents not to lose time in prosecuting American captors for\r\ncosts and damages. The Labuan was a good prize, but Mr. Seward is\r\nthe incarnation of wisdom and of justice!\r\n\r\n_April 20._--The not quite heavenly trio--Lincoln, Seward and\r\nHalleck--maintain, and find imbeciles and lickspittles enough to\r\nbelieve them, that they, the trio, could not as yet, act decidedly\r\nin the Emancipation question, they being in this, as in other\r\nquestions, too far in advance of the people. What blasphemy! Those\r\n_lumina mundi_ believe that the people will forget their records. To\r\nbe sure, the Americans, good-natured as they are, easily forget the\r\nmisdeeds of _yesterday_, but this _yesterday_ shall be somehow\r\nrecalled to their memory.\r\n\r\nIf all the West Pointers were like Grant, Rosecrans, Hooker, Barnard\r\nand thousands of them throughout all grades, then West Point would\r\nbe a blessing for the country. Unhappily, hitherto, the small, bad\r\nclique of West Point engineers No. one, exercised a preponderating\r\ninfluence on the conduct of the war, and thus West Point became in\r\ndisrespect, nay, in horror. I believe that the good West Pointers\r\nare more numerous than the altogether bad ones, but they often mar\r\ntheir best qualities by a certain, not altogether admirable, _esprit\r\ndu corps_.\r\n\r\n_April 20._--The generation crowding on this fogyish one will sit in\r\ncourt of justice over the evil-doers, over the helpless, over the\r\negotists who are to-day at work. That generation will begin the\r\nassizes during the lifetime of these great leaders in Administration,\r\nin politics, in war.\r\n\r\n  _Discite justitiam moniti nec temere divos!_\r\n\r\n_April 20._--Yesterday, April 19th, Mr. Lincoln and his Aide,\r\nHalleck, went to Acquia Creek to visit Hooker, to have a peep into\r\nhis plans, and, of course to babble about them. I hope Hooker will\r\nmost politely keep his own secrets.\r\n\r\n_April 21._--The American people never will and never can know and\r\nrealize the whole immensity of McClellan's treasonable incapacity,\r\nand to what extent all subsequent disasters have their roots in the\r\ninactivity of McClellan during 1861-62. Whatever may be the official\r\nreports, or private investigations, chronicles, confessions,\r\nmemoirs, all the facts will never be known. Never will it be known\r\nhow almost from the day when he was intrusted with the command,\r\nMcClellan was without any settled plans, always hesitating,\r\nirresolute; how almost hourly he (deliberately or not, I will not\r\ndecide) stuffed Mr. Lincoln with lies, and did the same to others\r\nmembers of the Cabinet. The evidences thereof are scattered in all\r\ndirections, and it is impossible to gather them all. Mr Lincoln\r\ncould testify--if he would. Almost every day I learn some such fact,\r\nbut I could not gather and record them all. Seward mostly sided with\r\nMcClellan, and so did Blair, _par nobile fratrum_.\r\n\r\nFew, if any, detailed reports of the campaigns and battles fought\r\nby McClellan have been sent by him to the President or to the War\r\nDepartment. Such reports ought to be made immediately; so it is done\r\nin every well regulated government. It is the duty of the staff of\r\nthe army to prepare the like reports. But McClellan did in his own\r\nway, and his reports, if ever he sends them, would only be\r\ndisquisitions elaborated _ex post_, and even apart from their\r\ntruthfulness--null.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of lies against Stanton have been elaborated by McClellan\r\nand his partisans, and circulated in the public. The truth is, that\r\nwhen Stanton became McClellan's superior, Stanton tried in every\r\nfriendly and devoted way to awake McClellan to the sense of honor\r\nand duty, to make him fight the enemy, and not dodge the fight under\r\nfalse pretenses. Stanton implored McClellan to get ready, and not to\r\nevade from day to day; and only when utterly disappointed by\r\nMcClellan's hesitation and untruthfulness, Stanton, so to say, in\r\ndespair, forced McClellan to action. Stanton was a friend of\r\nMcClellan, but sacrificed friendship to the sacred duty of a\r\npatriot.\r\n\r\n_April 21._--England plays as false in Europe as she does here.\r\nEngland makes a noise about Poland, and after a few speeches will\r\ngive up Poland. More than forty years of experience satisfied me\r\nabout England's political honesty. In 1831, Englishmen made\r\nspeeches, the Russian fought and finally overpowered us. England\r\nhates Russia as it hates this country, and fears them both. I hope a\r\ntime will come when America and Russia joining hands will throttle\r\nthat perfidious England. Were only Russia represented here in her\r\ntendencies, convictions and aspirations! What a brilliant, elevated,\r\ndominating position could have been that of a Russian diplomat here,\r\nduring this civil war. England and France would have been always in\r\nhis _ante-chambre_.\r\n\r\n_April 21._--Letter-writing is the fashion of the day. Halleck\r\ntreads into Seward's footsteps or shoes. Halleck thunders to Union\r\nleagues; to meetings; it reads splendidly, had only Halleck not\r\ncontributed to increase the \"perils\" of the country. Letter-writing\r\nis to atone for deadly blunders. The same with Seward as with\r\nHalleck. If Halleck would not have been fooled by Beauregard, if\r\nHalleck had taken Corinth instead of approaching the city by\r\nparallels distant _five miles_; the \"peril\" would no longer exist.\r\n\r\n_April 21._--Foreign and domestic papers herald that the honorable\r\nSanford, United States Minister to Belgium, and residing in\r\nBrussels, has given a great and highly admired diplomatic dinner,\r\netc., etc. I hope the Sewing machine was in honor and exposed as a\r\n_surtout_ on the banquet's table, and that only the guano-claim\r\nsuccessfully recovered from Venezuela, and other equally innocent\r\npickings paid the piper. _Vive la bagatelle_, and Seward's _alter\r\nego_ at the European courts.\r\n\r\n_April 22._--I so often meet men pushed into the background of\r\naffairs; men young, intelligent, active, clear-sighted, in one word,\r\nfitted out with all mental and intellectual requisites for\r\ncommanders, leaders, pilots and helmsmen of every kind; and\r\nnevertheless twenty times a day I hear repeated the question: \"Whom\r\nshall we put? we have no men.\"--It is wonderful that such men cannot\r\ncut their way through the apathy of public opinion, which seems to\r\nprefer old hacks for dragging a steam engine instead of putting to\r\nit good, energetic engineers, and let the steam work. Young men!\r\nyoung men, it is likewise your fault; you ought to assert\r\nyourselves; you ought to act, and push the fogies aside, instead of\r\nsubsiding into useless criticism, and useless consideration for\r\n_experienced_ narrow-mindedness, for ignorance or for helplessness.\r\nIn times as trying as ours are, men and not counterfeits are needed.\r\n\r\n_April 22._--In Europe, they wonder at our manner of carrying on the\r\nwar, at our General-in-Chief, who, in the eyes and the judgment of\r\nEuropean generals, acts without a plan and without _an ensemble_;\r\nthey wonder at the groping and shy general policy, and nevertheless\r\na policy full of contradictions. The Europeans thus astonished are\r\ntrue friends of the North, of the emancipation, and are competent\r\njudges.\r\n\r\n_April 22._--I hear that Hooker intends to make a kind of feint\r\nagainst Lee. Feints are old, silly tricks, almost impossible with\r\nlarge armies, and therefore very seldom feints are successful. Lee\r\nis not to be caught in this way, and the less so as he has as many\r\nspies as inhabitants, in, and around Hooker's camp. To cross the\r\nriver on a well selected point, and, Hooker-like, attack the\r\nsurprised enemy is the thing.\r\n\r\n_April 22._--\"Loyalty, loyalty,\" resounds in speeches, is re-echoed\r\nin letters, in newspapers. Well, Loyalty, but to whom? I hope not to\r\nthe person of any president, but to the ever-living principle of\r\nhuman liberty. Next eureka is, \"the administration must be\r\nsustained.\" Of course, but not because it intrinsically deserves it,\r\nbut because no better one can be had, and no radical change can be\r\neffected.\r\n\r\n_April 22._--The English Cabinet takes in sails, and begins to show\r\nless impudence in the violation of neutral duties. Lord John\r\nRussell's letter to the constructors of the piratical ships.\r\nCertainly Mr. Seward will claim the credit of having brought England\r\nto terms by his eloquent dispatches. Sumner may dispute with Seward\r\nthe influence on English fogies. In reality, the bitter and\r\nexasperated feeling of the people frightened England.\r\n\r\n_April 24._--It is repulsive to read how the press exults that the\r\nfamine in the South is our best ally. Well! I hate the rebels, but I\r\nwould rather that the superiority of brains may crush them, and not\r\nfamine. The rebels manfully supporting famine, give evidence of\r\nheroism; and why is it in such disgusting cause!\r\n\r\n_April 23._--Senator Sumner emphatically receives and admits into\r\nchurch and communion, the freshly to emancipation converted General\r\nThomas, Adjutant General, now organizing Africo-American regiments\r\nin the Mississippi valley. Better _late than never_, for such\r\nThomases, Hallecks, etc., only I doubt if a Thomas will ever become\r\na Paul.\r\n\r\n_April 24._--Our State Department does not enjoy a high\r\nconsideration abroad. I see this from public diplomatic acts, and\r\nfrom private letters. I am sure that Mr. Dayton has found this out\r\nlong ago, and I suppose so did Mr. Adams. Of course not a Sanford.\r\nIf the State Department had not at its back twenty-two millions of\r\nAmericans, foreign Cabinets would treat us--God, alone, knows how.\r\n\r\n_April 24._--I hope to live long enough to see the end of this war,\r\nand then to disentangle my brains from the pursuits which now fill\r\nthem. Then goodbye, O, international laws, with your customs and\r\nrules. England handled them for centuries, as the wolf with the lamb\r\nat the spring. When I witness the confusion and worse, here, I seem\r\nto see--_en miniature_--reproduced some parts of the Byzantine\r\ntimes. All cracks but not the people, and to ---- I am indebted that\r\nmy brains hold out.\r\n\r\n_April 24._--What a confusion Burnside's order No. 8 reveals; the\r\npresident willing, unwilling, shifting, and time rapidly running on.\r\n\r\n_April 24._--Senator Sumner, without being called as he ought to\r\nhave been--to give advice, discovered the Peterhoff case. The\r\nSenator laid before the President, all the authorities bearing on\r\nthe case, showed by them to the President, that the mail was not to\r\nbe returned to the English Consul, but lawfully ought to be opened\r\nby the Prize Court. The Senator so far convinced the President, that\r\nMr. Lincoln, next morning at once violated the statutes, and through\r\nMr. Seward, instructed the District Attorney to instruct the Court\r\nto give up the mail unopened to England.\r\n\r\nBrave and good Sumner exercises influence on Mr. Lincoln.\r\n\r\n_April 24._--Every one has his word to say about civilized warfare,\r\nabout international warfare, laws of war, etc. In principle, no laws\r\nof public war are applicable to rebels, and if they are, it is only\r\non the grounds of expediency or of humanity. Laws of international\r\nwarfare are applicable to independent nations, and not to rebels.\r\nHas England ever treated the Irish according to the laws of\r\ninternational warfare? Has England considered Napper Tandy and his\r\naids as belligerents? The word _war_ in its legal or international\r\nsense ought to have been suppressed at the start from the official,\r\nnational vocabulary; to suppress a rebellion is not to _wage a war_.\r\n\r\n_April 25._--When the bloody tornado shall pass over, and the normal\r\ncondition be restored, then only will begin to germinate the seeds\r\nof good and of evil, seeds so broadcast sown by this rebellion. All\r\nwill become either recast or renovated, the plough of war having\r\npenetrated to the core of the people. Customs, habits, notions,\r\nmodes of thinking and of appreciating events and men, political,\r\nsocial, domestic morals will be changed or modified. The men\r\nbaptized in blood and fire will shake all. Many of them endowed with\r\nall the rays of manhood, others lawless and reckless. Many domestic\r\nhearths will be upturned, extinct, destroyed; the women likewise\r\npassing through the terrible probation. Many women remained true to\r\nthe loftiest womanhood, others became carried away by the impure\r\nturmoil. All this will tell and shape out the next generations.\r\n\r\nI ardently hope that this war will breed and educate a population\r\nstrong, clear-sighted, manly, decided in ideas and in action; and\r\nsuch a population will be scattered all over this extensive country.\r\nMen who stood the test of battles, will not submit to the village,\r\ntownship, or to politicians at large, but will judge for themselves,\r\nand will take the lead. These men went into the field a common iron\r\nore, they will return steel. The shock will tear the scales from the\r\npeople's eyes, and the people easily will discern between pure grain\r\nand chaff. I am sure that a man who fought for the great cause, who\r\nbrought home honorable wounds and scars, whose limbs are rotting on\r\nfields of battle; such a man will become an authority; and\r\ndeath-knell to the abject race of politicians; the days of shallow,\r\ncold, rhetors are numbered, and vanity and selfishness will be\r\ndoomed. _Non vobis, non vobis--sed populo...._\r\n\r\n_April 25._--Mr. Seward is elated, triumphant, grand. Emigration\r\nfrom Europe, evoked, beckoned by him is to replace the population\r\nlost in the war.\r\n\r\nWhat is to be more scorned? Seward's heartless cruelty or his\r\nreckless ignorance, to believe that such a numerous emigration will\r\npour in, as to at once make up for those of whom at least one third\r\nwere butchered by flippancy of Mr. Seward's policy to which Lincoln\r\nbecame committed.\r\n\r\n_April 26._--The people are bound onwards _per aspera ad astra_: the\r\ngiddy brained helmsmen, military and civil chiefs and commanders may\r\nhurl the people in an opposite direction.\r\n\r\n_April 26._--Whoever will dispassionately read the various statutes\r\npublished by the 37th Congress; will speak of its labors as I do,\r\nand the future historian will find in those statutes the best light\r\nby which to comprehend and to appreciate the prevailing temper of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n_April 27._--Rhetors and some abolitionists of the small church--not\r\nWendell Phillips--still are satisfied with mistakes and disasters,\r\nbecause _otherwise slavery would not have been destroyed_. If they\r\nhave a heart, it is a clump of ice, and their brains are common\r\njelly. With men at the head who would have had faith and a lofty\r\nconsciousness of their task, the rebellion and slavery could have\r\nbeen both crushed in the year 1861, or any time in 1862. Any one but\r\nan idiot ought to have seen at the start, that as the rebels fight\r\nto maintain slavery, in striking slavery you strike at the rebels.\r\nThe blood spilt because of the narrow-mindedness of the leaders,\r\nthat blood will cry to heaven, whatever be the absolution granted by\r\nthe rhetors and by the small church.\r\n\r\n_April 27._--Mr. Seward went on a visit to the army, dragging with\r\nhim some diplomats. The army was not to forget the existence of the\r\nSecretary of State, this foremost Union-saviour, and the candidate\r\nfor the next Presidency. Others say that Seward ran away to dodge\r\nthe Peterhoff case.\r\n\r\n_April 27._--How the politicians of the _Times_ and of the\r\n_Chronicle_ lustily attack--NOW--McClellan. If I am well informed,\r\nit was the editor of the _Chronicle_, himself a leading politician,\r\nand influential in both Houses, who instigated Lovejoy, Member of\r\nCongress, to move resolutions in favor of McClellan for the battle\r\nat Williamsburgh, where McClellan did what he could to have his own\r\narmy destroyed.\r\n\r\n_April 28._--Mr. Seward elaborated for the President a paper in the\r\nPeterhoff case--and, _horribile dictu_, as I am told--even the\r\nPresident found the argument, or whatever else it was, very, very\r\nlight. The President sent for the chief clerk to explain to him the\r\nunintelligible document--and more darkness prevailed. Bravo, Mr.\r\nSeward! your name and your place in the history of the times are\r\nfirmly nailed!\r\n\r\n_April 28._--The time will come, and even I may yet witness it, when\r\nthese deep wounds struck by the rebellion will be healed; when even\r\nthe scars of blows dealt to the people by such Lincolns, Sewards,\r\nMcClellans, Hallecks, the other _minor gens_, will be invisible--and\r\nthis great people, steeled by events, will be more powerful than it\r\never was. Then the Monroe doctrine will be applied in all its\r\nsternness and rigor, and from pole to pole no European power will\r\ndefile this continent. The so-called Americo-Hispano-Latin races\r\nhumbugged by Europe, will have found how cursed is _any whatever_\r\nEuropean influence. The main land and the Isles must be purified\r\ntherefrom. Will any European government, power, or statesman permit\r\nthe United States to acquire even the most barren rock on the\r\nEuropean continent? The American continent is equal, if not more to\r\nEurope, and the degrading stigma of European colonies and\r\npossessions must be blotted from this American soil.\r\n\r\n_April 29._--The President appoints a day of fasting and prayer.\r\nWell! it is not for the people to fast and to pray, but for the\r\nevil-doers. Lead on, Mr. Lincoln, attended by Seward and\r\nHalleck--all in sackcloth and ashes.\r\n\r\n_April 29._--The President's and General Martindale's proclamations\r\nofficially recognize the existence of God. It is consoling, and\r\nknocks down the far-famed _Deo erexit Voltaire_.\r\n\r\n_April 29._--To the right and to the left I hear praise of Mr. Chase\r\nas the great financier. Well he may be praised, having in his hand\r\nthousands and thousands of cows to be milked. The _financier_ is the\r\npeople, and prevents Chase from ruining the country.\r\n\r\n_April 29._--A Richmond paper calls McClellan a compound of lies and\r\nof cowardice. McClellan, the fetish of Copperheads and of\r\npeace-makers. The Richmond paper must have some special reasons\r\nwhich justify this stern appreciation.\r\n\r\n_April 30._--The _World_, a paper born in barter, in mud and in\r\nshamelessness, condemns General Wadsworth's name to eternal infamy.\r\nWhat a court of honor the _World's_ scribblers! The one a hireling\r\nof the brothers Woods, and sold by them in the lump to some other\r\nCopperhead financier; the other a pants and overcoats stealing beau.\r\nThe rest must be similar.\r\n\r\n_April 30._--The abomination of slavery makes such a splendid field\r\nto any rhetor attacking that curse. Were it not so, how many rhetors\r\nwould be abolitionists?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY, 1863.\r\n\r\n     Advance -- Crossing -- Chancellorsville -- Hooker -- Staff -- Lee\r\n     -- Jackson -- Stunned -- Suggestions -- Meade -- Swinton -- La\r\n     Fayette -- Intrigues -- Happy Grant -- Rosecrans -- Halleck --\r\n     Foote -- Elections -- Re-elections -- Tracks -- Seward -- 413 --\r\n     etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 1._--General anxiety about Hooker. If he successfully crosses\r\nthe river, this alone will count among the most brilliant actions in\r\nmilitary history. To cross a river with a large army under the eyes,\r\nalmost under the guns of an enemy, concentrated, strong, vigilant,\r\nand supported by the population, would honor the name of any\r\nworld-renowned captain.\r\n\r\n_May 2._--Mr. Seward forces upon the Department of the Navy,\r\ninstructions for our cruizers that are so obviously favorable to\r\nblockade-runners, that our officers may rather give up capturing.\r\nMr. Seward's instructions concede more to England, than was ever\r\nasked by England, or by any neutral from a belligerent of a third\r\nclass power.\r\n\r\n_May 2._--How could Mr. Adams to that extent violate all the\r\ninternational proprieties, and deliver a kind of pass to a vessel\r\nloaded in England with arms and ammunition for Matamoras. It is an\r\noffence against England, and a flagrant violation of neutrality to\r\nFrance. Not yet time to show our teeth to them. And all this in\r\nfavor of that adventurer and almost pickpocket Zermann, this\r\nmock-admiral, mock-general, whom twice here they put up for a\r\ngeneral in our army. But for me they would have made him one, and\r\ndisgraced the American uniform. This police malefactor was\r\npatronised by some New Yorkers, by Senator Harris and from Mr.\r\nSeward may have got strong letters for Mr. Adams. It is probable\r\nthat Zermann sold Mr. Adams to secessionists who may have wished to\r\nstir up trouble by this passport business. I am sure the affair will\r\nbe hushed up and entirely forgotten.\r\n\r\n_May 2._--Glorious! glorious. Hooker crossed--and successfully. The\r\nrebels, caught napping, disturbed him not. Now at them, at them,\r\nwithout loss of an hour! The soldiers will perform wonders when in\r\nthe hands of true soldiers for commanders, when led on by a true\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\nO heaven! Why does Hooker publish such a proclamation? It is the\r\nmerest nonsense. To thank the soldiers, few words were needed. But\r\nto say that the enemy must come and fight us on our own ground. O\r\nheaven! Hooker ought not to have had time to write a proclamation,\r\nbut ought to pitch into the rebels, surprise and confuse them, and\r\nnot wait for them. What is the matter? I tremble.\r\n\r\n_May 3._--Rumors, anxiety. The patriots feverish. One might easily\r\nbecome delirious.... Copperheads, Washington secessionists, spread\r\nall kinds of disastrous rumors. The secessionists here in\r\nWashington, are always invisible when any success attends our arms;\r\nbut when we are worsted, they are forth coming on all corners, as\r\ntoads are after a shower of rain.\r\n\r\n_May 4._--Confused news, but it seems that Hooker is successful.\r\nStill not so complete as was expected. Hooker's manoeuvring seems\r\nheavy, slow.\r\n\r\nThe Copperheads more dangerous and more envenomed than the\r\nsecessionists. And very natural. The secesh risks all for a bad\r\ncause and a bad creed. But the _World_ has no conviction, only envy\r\nand mischief, and risks nothing.\r\n\r\n_May 5._--Nothing decided; nothing certain. From what I can gather,\r\nthe new generation or stratum of generals fights differently from\r\nthe style of the Simon-pure McClellan tribe. They are in front, and\r\nnot in the rear according to regulations.\r\n\r\nHalleck digs, digs entrenchments around Washington. I meet\r\nbattalions with spades. Engineers show their poor skill! and Mr.\r\nLincoln is comforted to be strongly defended!\r\n\r\n_May 5._--Night, storm, rain. News rather doubtful. Stanton said to\r\nme that he believes in Hooker, even if Hooker be unsuccessful.\r\nBravo! Not want of success condemns a general, but the way and\r\nmanner in which he acted; and how he dealt with events.\r\n\r\n_May 6._--Seward is bitterly attacked by the _World_, and by other\r\nCopperheads. I could not unite with a _World_ and with Copperheads\r\nto attack even a Seward. They are too filthy.--_Arcades ambo._\r\n\r\n_May 6._--Hooker retreats and recrosses the river. Say now what you\r\nwill to make it swallow, at the best it is an unsuccessful affair,\r\nif not an actual disaster. I believe not in the swelling of the\r\nriver. Bosh! in three days these rivers fell. Have any generals\r\nFranklinized? I dare not ask; I most wish not to know anything.\r\n\r\n_May 7._--_Nocte pluit tota (not) redeunt spectacula mane_; grim,\r\ndark, cold, rainy night. Are the Gods against us? Or has imbecility\r\nexasperated even the merciful but rational Christian God to that\r\nextent, that God turns his back upon us?\r\n\r\n_May 7._--Hiob's news come in, confused to sure, but still one finds\r\nsomething like a foothold. I am thunderstruck, annihilated. I\r\nlistened to Hooker's best friends but can hardly help crying. Hooker\r\nis a failure as a commander of a large army. Hooker is good for a\r\ncorps or two, but not for the whole command and responsibility. From\r\nall that I can learn, Hooker fights well, courageously, but he, like\r\nthe others, _has not the greatest and truest gift_ in a commander:\r\n_Hooker cannot manoeuvre his army._ All that I hear up to this\r\nmoment strengthened my conclusion, and I am sure that the more the\r\ndetails come in, the stronger the truth will come out. Hooker can\r\nnot manoeuvre an army. Hooker may attack vigorously, stand as a\r\nrock, but cannot manoeuvre.\r\n\r\nHooker seems to have committed the same faults and mistake as his\r\npredecessors did. He kept more men out of the fire than in the fire.\r\nAnd this from Hooker who accused his former chiefs of that very\r\nfault. But poor Hooker was unsupported by a good staff. This check\r\nmay turn out to be a great disaster. At any rate, a whole campaign\r\nis lost, and one more commander may go overboard. Hooker will raise\r\nagainst him a terrible storm. God grant that Hooker could be\r\nhonestly defended.\r\n\r\n--_La critique est aisée, mais l'art est difficile_ is perhaps again\r\nillustrated by Hooker. If Hooker is in fault, then he ought not to\r\nsurvive this disaster. After all that he said, after all that we\r\nsaid and repeated in his favor, to turn out an awful mistake!\r\n\r\n_May 8._--Worse and worse. I do not learn one single fact\r\nexculpating Hooker. I scarcely dare to look in the people's faces.\r\nThe rain is no justification. Hooker showed no vigor before the\r\nrain. After he crossed, and had his army in hand, instead of\r\nattacking, he subsided, seemingly trying to find out the plans of\r\nthe rebels instead of acting so as not to give them time to make\r\nplans or to execute them.\r\n\r\n_Tel brille au second rang qui s'éclipse au premier_, is almost all\r\nto be said in Hooker's defense. I tremble to know all the minute\r\ndetails. A paroled prisoner returned from Richmond said to me that\r\nterror was terrible in Richmond--that Lee and his army had no\r\nsupplies. No troops in Richmond--Stoneman cut the bridges. The\r\nrebels were on the brink of a precipice, and extricated themselves.\r\n\r\n_May 8._--Boutwell, Member of Congress, told me that the district of\r\nSt. Louis paid more new taxes to January than any other district in\r\nthe United States. Bravo, Missourians. That is loyalty.\r\n\r\n_May 8: Evening_--More details about this unhappy Chancellorsville.\r\nLee and the rebel generals have been decidedly surprised--in the\r\nmilitary sense--by the crossing of the river, and by Hooker coming\r\nthus in part in their rear. But we lost time, they retrieved and\r\n_manoeuvred_ splendidly; better than they ever have done before. Lee\r\nshowed that he has learned something. Lee showed that, by a year's\r\npractice, he has at length acquired skill in handling a large army.\r\nThe apprenticeship on our side is not so successful; our generals\r\nhave no experience therein, and McClellan was worse at Harper's\r\nFerry in November than at Williamsburg in the spring. McClellan\r\nlearned nothing. Will it be possible to find among our Potomac\r\ngenerals one in whom revelation will supply experience?\r\n\r\nThe more I learn about that affair the more thoroughly I am\r\nconvinced that Hooker's misfortune had the same cause and source as\r\nthe misfortunes of those before him. No military scientific staff\r\nand chief-of-staff. Butterfield was not even with Hooker, but at\r\nFalmouth at the telegraph. If it is so, then no words can\r\nsufficiently condemn them all.\r\n\r\nIf Kepler, or Herschel, or Fulton, or Ericcson had violated axioms\r\nand laws of mathematics and dynamics, their labors would have been\r\nas so much chaff and dust. War is mechanism and science, inspiration\r\nand rule; a genuine staff for an army is a scientific law, and if\r\nthis law is not recognized and is violated, then the disasters\r\nbecome a mathematically certain result.\r\n\r\n_May 8._--The defenders of Hooker call the result a drawn battle.\r\nMr. Lincoln calls it a lost battle. I call it a miscarried, if not\r\naltogether lost, campaign.\r\n\r\n_May 9._--The poorest defence of Hooker is that the terrain was\r\nsuch that he could not manoeuvre. If the terrain was so bad, Hooker\r\nought to have known it beforehand, and not brought his army there.\r\nThe rebels have not been prevented from marching and manoeuvring on\r\nthe same ground, and not prevented from attacking Hooker, all of\r\nwhich ought to have been done by our army.\r\n\r\n_May 9._--All is again in unspeakable confusion. All seems to crack.\r\nThis time, more than ever, a powerful mind is necessary to\r\ndisentangle the country. If all is confirmed concerning Hooker's\r\nincapacity, then it is a crime to keep him in command; but who after\r\nhim? It becomes now only a guess, a lottery.\r\n\r\nThe acting Chief-of Staff on the battle-field was General Van Alen.\r\nBrave and devoted; but Van Alen saw the fire for the first time, and\r\nmakes no claims to be a scientific soldier.\r\n\r\n_May 10._--I wrote to Stanton to call his attention to, and explain\r\nthe reasons of Hooker's so-called miscarriage. The insufficiency,\r\nthe inadequacy of his staff and of chief-of-staff. Hooker attempted\r\nwhat not even Napoleon would have dared to attempt, to fight an army\r\nof more than one hundred thousand men, literally without a staff, or\r\nwithout a thorough, scientific and experienced chief-of-staff. I\r\ndirected Stanton's attention to evidences from military history.\r\nPersons interested in such questions read Battle of Ligny and\r\nWaterloo, by Thiers.\r\n\r\nCobden, Cobden the friend of the Union, can no more stand Mr.\r\nSeward's confused logomachy, and in a speech sneers at Mr. Seward's\r\ndispatches. The New York _Times_ _dutifully_ perverts Cobden's\r\nspeech; other papers _dutifully_ keep silent.\r\n\r\n_May 10._--To extenuate Hooker's misconduct, his supporters assert\r\nthat he was struck, stunned, and his brains affected. Hooker was\r\nstunned on Friday, and his campaign was already lost on Tuesday\r\nbefore, when he wrote his silly proclamation, when he subsided with\r\nthe army in a _semi-lunar_ (the worst form of all) camp, and\r\nchallenged Lee to come and fight him. Lee did it. Hooker was\r\nintellectually stunned on Tuesday. Further: the results of the\r\nmaterial stunning on Friday could never have been so fatal if the\r\narmy had been organized on the basis of common sense, as are all the\r\narmies of intelligent governments in Europe. The chief-of-staff\r\nelaborates with the commander the plan of the action; he is\r\ntherefore familiar with the intentions of the commander. When the\r\ncommander is disabled, the chief-of-staff continues the action. At\r\nthe storming of Warsaw, in 1831, Prince Paschkewitsch, the\r\ncommander, was disabled or stunned, and his chief-of-staff, Count\r\nToll, directed the storm for two days, and Warsaw fell into Russian\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nNo more effective is the defence of the defeat, by throwing the\r\nfault on the Eleventh Army Corps. The Eleventh Corps was put so much\r\nin advance of a very foggishly--if not worse--laid out camp, that\r\nit was temptingly exposed to any attack of the enemy. The Eleventh\r\nCorps was separated from the rest of the army, as was Casey's\r\ndivision in the Chickahominy. The laying of a camp, the distribution\r\nof the corps, in a well organized army, is the work of the staff and\r\nof its chief; but Butterfield was not even then in Chancellorsville.\r\nLee, who if caught napping, quickly awoke, wheeled his army as if it\r\nwere a child's toy, cut his way through woods which amazed Hooker,\r\nand arrived before Hooker's semi-lunar camp. We, all the time, as it\r\nseems, were ignorant of Lee's movements. A good staff, and what Lee\r\ndid, we would have accomplished. Lee quietly found out our\r\nvulnerable point; and struck the blow. That, if you please, _was_ a\r\nstunner. Finally: the Eleventh Corps was eleven or twelve thousand\r\nstrong. The weakest in the army, equal to a strong division in a\r\nEuropean army of one hundred thousand men. The breaking of a\r\ndivision or of twelve thousand men posted at the extreme flank,\r\nought not and could not have been so fatal to the whole campaign. A\r\ntrue captain would have been prepared for such eventuality. Battles\r\nare recorded in history when a whole wing broke down and retreated,\r\nand nevertheless the true captain restored order and fortunes, and\r\nwon the battle.\r\n\r\nI am told that the rebels attacked in columns, and not in lines. The\r\nrebels learn and learned, and are not conceited. The terrain here in\r\nVirginia is specially fit for attacks in columns, according to\r\ncontinental European tactics. We will not learn, we know all, we\r\nhave graduated--at West Point.\r\n\r\n_May 11._--I have it from a very reliable source, that Mr. Lincoln\r\nconsiders Sumner to be not very entertaining.\r\n\r\n_May 11._--The confusion is on the increase. Statesmen, politicians,\r\nhonest, dishonest, stupid and intelligent, all huddled together.\r\nTheir name is legion--and what a stench. It is abominable! And many\r\nthink, and many may think, that I find pleasure in dwelling on such\r\nevents, on such men as are here. When I was a child, my tutor\r\ningrained into my memory the _Cum stercore dum certo_, etc. But at\r\nany cost, I shall try to preserve the true reflection of events, of\r\ntimes, and of the actors.\r\n\r\n_May 12._--Jackson dead. Dead invincible! and therefore fell in time\r\nfor his heroic name. Jackson took a sham, a falsehood, for faith and\r\nfor truth--but he stood up faithfully, earnestly, devotedly to his\r\nconvictions. Whatever have been his political errors, Jackson will\r\npass to posterity, the hero of history, of poetry, and of the\r\nlegend. His name was a terror, it was an army for friend and for\r\nenemy. For Jackson\r\n\r\n  _O selig der, dem er in Siegesglantze,\r\n   Die blutigen Lorbeer'n um die Schlaefe windet._\r\n\r\n_May 12._--_Sewardiana._ Lord Lyons, or rather the English\r\ngovernment, objects and protests against the instructions given to\r\nour cruisers, which instructions are intrinsically faultless. Mr.\r\nLincoln jumps up and writes a clap-trap dispatch, wholly contrary to\r\nour statutes. Mr. Seward promises what he cannot perform, and this\r\ntime the upshot is that his dispatch came before the Cabinet and was\r\nquashed, or, at least, recast.\r\n\r\nThe Morning _Chronicle_, of Washington--_magnum_ Administration's\r\n_excrementum_--attacks SCHALK and his military reasonings. Oh! great\r\npolitician.\r\n\r\n  _Sus Minervam docet._\r\n\r\n_May 13._--The defenders of Hooker affirm that Sedgwick was in\r\nfault, and disobeyed orders.\r\n\r\n1st. I have good reasons firmly to believe that Sedgwick heroically\r\nobeyed and executed orders sent to him. No doubt can exist about it.\r\n\r\n2d. The orders written by _such_ a staff as Hooker's might have been\r\nwritten in _such_ a way as to confuse the God Mars himself. Marshal\r\nSoult could fight, but as a chief of Napoleon's staff at Waterloo,\r\ncould not write intelligible orders.\r\n\r\n3d. Setting aside Sedgwick's disobedience of orders, it does not in\r\nthe least justify Hooker in hearing the roar of cannon, and knowing\r\nwhat was going on, and at the head of eighty thousand men allowing\r\nSedgwick to be crushed; and all this within a few miles. Fitz-John\r\nPorter was cashiered for a similar offense. Hooker's action is by\r\nfar worse, and thus Hooker deserves to be shot.\r\n\r\n_May 13._--Rumors that Halleck is to take the command of the army,\r\ntogether with Hooker. I almost believe it, because it is nameless,\r\nand here all that is illogical is, eventually, probable.\r\n\r\nPoor Hooker. Undoubtedly, he had a soldier's spark in him. But\r\nadulation, flunkeyism, concert, covered the spark with dirt and mud.\r\nI pity him, but for all that, down with Hooker!\r\n\r\nIf Hooker or Halleck commands the army, Lee will have the _knack_ to\r\nalways whip them.\r\n\r\n_May 14._--Wrote a paper for Senators Wade and Chandler, to point\r\nout the reasons of Hooker's failure. Did my utmost to explain to\r\nthem that warfare to-day is not empiricism, but science, and that\r\nempiricism is only better when sham-science has the upper hand.\r\nHooker's staff was worse than sham-science, and was not even\r\nempiricism.\r\n\r\nI explained that such evils, although very deeply rooted, can,\r\nnevertheless, be remedied. An energetic government can, and ought to\r\nlook for and find, the remedy. The army, as it is, contains good\r\nmaterials for every branch of organization; it is the duty of the\r\ngovernment to discover them and give them adequate functions.\r\n\r\nFurther: I suggested to these patriotic Senators that as in the\r\npresent emergency, it is difficult to put the hand on any general\r\ninspiring confidence, the President, the Secretary of War and the\r\nSenators, ought immediately to go to the army, and call together\r\nall the commanders of corps and of divisions. The President ought\r\nto explain to the difficulty, nay, the impossibility of making a new\r\nchoice. But as the generals are well aware that there must be a\r\ncommander, and that they know each other in the fire, the President\r\nappeals to their patriotism, and asks them to elect, by secret\r\nballot on the spot, one from among themselves.\r\n\r\n_May 14: One o'clock, P. M._--The President, Halleck and Hooker in\r\nsecret conclave. Stanton, it seems, is excluded. If so, I am glad on\r\nhis account. God have mercy on this wronged and slaughtered people.\r\nNo holy spirit will inspire the Conclave.\r\n\r\n_May 15._--The English Government shelters behind the Enlistment\r\nAct. The Act is a municipal law, and a foreign nation has nothing to\r\ndo with it. We are with England on friendly terms, and England has\r\ntowards us duties of friendly comity, whatever be the municipal law.\r\nTo invoke the Enlistment Act against us, is a mean pettifogger's\r\ntrick.\r\n\r\nA good-natured imbecile, C----, everybody's friend, and friend of\r\nLincoln, Seward and the Administration in the lump, C---- asked me\r\nwhat I want by thus bitterly attacking everybody.\r\n\r\n\"I want the rebellion crushed, the slaves emancipated; but above all\r\nI want human life not to be sacrilegiously wasted; I want men, not\r\ncounterfeits.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my dear, point out where to find them?\" answered everybody's\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n_May 15._--On their return from Falmouth, the patriotic Senators\r\ntold me that they felt the ground for my proposed election of a\r\ncommander by his colleagues, and that General Meade would have the\r\ngreatest chance of being elected. _Va pour Meade._ Some say that\r\nMeade is a Copperhead at heart. Nonsense. Let him be a Copperhead at\r\nheart, and fight as he fought under Franklin, or fight as he would\r\nhave fought at Chancellorsville if Hooker had not been trebly\r\n_stunned_.\r\n\r\n_May 15._--Much that I see here reminds me of the debauched times in\r\nFrance; on a microscopic scale, however; as well as of the times of\r\nthe _Directoire_. The jobbers, contractors, lobbyists, etc., here\r\ncould perhaps carry the prize even over the supereminently infamous\r\njobbers, etc., during the _Directoire_.\r\n\r\n_May 15._--\"Peel of Halleck, Seward and Sumner,\" exclaims Wendell\r\nPhilips, the apostle. Wendell Samson shakes the pillars, and the\r\nroof may crush the Philistines, and those who lack the needed pluck.\r\n\r\n_May 16._--The President visited Falmouth, consoled Hooker and\r\nButterfield, shook hands with the generals, told them a story, and\r\nreturned as wise as he went concerning the miscarriage at\r\nChancellorsville. The repulse of our army does not frighten Mr.\r\nLincoln, and this I must applaud from my whole heart. It is however\r\nanother thing to admire the cool philosophy with which are swallowed\r\nthe causes of a Fredericksburgh and a Chancellorsville--causes\r\nwhich devoured about twenty thousand men, if not more.\r\n\r\n_May 16._--Strange stories, and incredible, if any thing now-a-days\r\nis incredible. Mr. Lincoln, inspired by Hitchcock and Owen, turns\r\nspiritualist and rapper. Poor spirits, to be obliged to answer such\r\ncalls!\r\n\r\n_May 17._--A high-minded, devoted, ardent patriot, a general of the\r\narmy, had a long conversation with the President, who was sad, and\r\nvery earnest. The patriot observed that Mr. Lincoln wanted only\r\nencouragement to take himself the command of the Army of the\r\nPotomac. As it stands now, this would be even better than any other\r\nchoice. I am sure that once with the army, separated from Seward &\r\nCo., Mr. Lincoln will show great courage. If only Mr. Lincoln could\r\nthen give the _walking papers_ to General Halleck!\r\n\r\nOn the authority of the above conversation, I respectfully wrote to\r\nthe President, and urged him to take the army's command, but to\r\ncreate a genuine staff for the army around his person.\r\n\r\nI submitted to the President that the question relating to a staff\r\nfor the Commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy [the President] and\r\nfor the commander-in-chief of the Army, Major-General Halleck, has\r\nbeen often discussed by some New York, Boston and Washington\r\ndailies, and the wonted amount of confusion is thereby thrown\r\nbroadcast among the public. The names of several generals have been\r\nmentioned by the press as a staff of the President. I doubt if any\r\nof them are properly qualified for such an important position. They\r\nare rather fitted for a military council _ad latus_ to the\r\nPresident. Such a council exists in Russia near the person of the\r\nemperor; but it has nothing in common with a staff, with staff\r\nduties, or with the intellectual qualification for such duties. The\r\nproject of such a council here was many months ago submitted to the\r\nSecretary of War. A Commander-in-chief, as mentioned above--one\r\nfighting and manoeuvring on paper--making plans in his office,\r\nunfamiliar with every thing constituting a genuine military,\r\nscientific or practical soldier--to whom field and battle are\r\nuncongenial or improper--to whom grand and even small tactics are a\r\n_terra incognita_--such a chief is at best but an imitation of the\r\nEnglish military organization, and certainly it is only in this\r\ncountry that obsolete English routine is almost uniformly imitated.\r\nSuch a Commander-in-chief might have been of some small usefulness\r\nwhen our Army was but thirteen thousand to sixteen thousand strong,\r\nwas scattered over the country, or warred only with Indians on the\r\nfrontier. But all the great and highly perfected military powers on\r\nthe continent of Europe consider such a commander a wholly\r\nunnecessary luxury, and not even Austria indulges in it now.\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign against Napoleon in 1813-14 the allies were\r\ncommanded by a generalissimo, the Prince Schwartzenberg; but he\r\nmoved with the army, actively directed that great campaign.\r\n\r\nThe Continental sovereigns of Europe are born Commanders-in-chief of\r\ntheir respective land and naval forces. As such, each of them has a\r\npersonal staff; but such a personal staff must not be confused with\r\na general, central staff, the paramount necessity of which for any\r\nmilitary organization is similar to the nervous system and the brain\r\nfor the human body. Special extensive studies as well as practical\r\nfamiliarity with the use of the drill and the tactics of infantry,\r\ncavalry and artillery, constitute absolutely essential requirements\r\nfor an officer of such a staff. The necessary military special\r\ninformation also, as well as the duties, are very varied and\r\ncomplicated (see \"_Logistics_\" by Jomini and others.) This country\r\nhas no such school of staff. West Point neither instructs nor\r\nprovides the Army with officers for staff duties; and of course the\r\ndifficulty now to obtain efficient officers for a staff, if not\r\ninsurmountable, is appalling, and is only to be mastered by a great\r\ndeal of good will, by insight and by discernment.\r\n\r\nMany months ago, I pointed out, in the press, this paramount\r\ndeficiency in the organization of the Federal Army. The Prince de\r\nJoinville ascribes General McClellan's military failures to the\r\nparamount inefficiency of that General's staff. Any one in the least\r\nfamiliar with military organization and military science is\r\nthunderstruck to find how the Federal military organization deal\r\nwith staffs, and what is their comprehension of the qualification\r\nfor staff duties.\r\n\r\nIt deserves a mention that engineers and engineering constitute what\r\nis rather a secondary element in the organization of a special or of\r\na general central staff.\r\n\r\nPlans of wide comprehensive campaigns are generally elaborated by\r\nsuch general staffs. In the campaigns of 1813-14, the sovereigns of\r\nRussia and Prussia were surrounded by their respective general, and\r\nnot only personal staffs. With the Colonels Dybitsch and Toll, of\r\nthe Russian general staff, originated that bold, direct march on\r\nParis, whose results changed the destinies of Europe. Other similar,\r\nalthough not so mighty facts are easily found in general military\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nFinally, I pointed out to the President, the names of Generals\r\nSedgewick, Meade, Warren, Humphries, and Colonel J. Fry as fit for,\r\nand understanding, the duties of the staff.\r\n\r\n_May 17._--I record a rumor, which I supposed, and found out to be,\r\nwithout much foundation; it is nevertheless worth recording.\r\n\r\nThe rumor in question says that the President wished to dismiss\r\nStanton and to take General Butler; that Mr. Seward was to decide\r\nbetween the two, and that he declined the responsibility. Seward and\r\nButler in the same sack! Butler would have swallowed Seward, hat,\r\ninternational laws and all--and of course Seward declined the\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nBut now a story comes, which is a sad truth. William Swinton,\r\nmilitary reporter for the _Times_, a young man of uncommon ability\r\nand truthfulness, prepared for his paper a detailed article about\r\nthe whole of Hooker's Chancellorsville expedition. Before being\r\npublished, the article was shown to Mr. Lincoln; and it was\r\ntelegraphed to New York that if the article comes out, the author\r\nmay accidentally find himself a boarder in Fort Lafayette. Almost\r\nthe same day the President telegraphed to a patriot to whom Mr.\r\nLincoln unbuttoned himself, not to reveal to anybody the\r\nconversation. Both these occurrences had in view only one object--it\r\nwas to keep truth out of the people's knowledge. Truth is a\r\ndangerous weapon in the hands of a people.\r\n\r\n_May 19._--The President repeatedly refuses to make General Butler\r\nuseful to the country's cause, notwithstanding the best men in the\r\ncountry ask Butler's appointment. I am only astonished that the best\r\nmen can hope and expect anything of the sort; for, when a Butler will\r\ncome up, then Sewards and Hallecks easily may go down--but--_pia\r\ndesideria_.\r\n\r\n_May 20._--From many, many and various quarters, continually unholy\r\nefforts are made to excuse Hooker and Butterfield; the President\r\nseemingly listens and excuses. Well, I know what a Napoleon, or any\r\nother even unmilitary sovereign, would do with both.\r\n\r\n_May 21._--O, for light! for light! O, to find a man! one to prize,\r\nto trust, to have faith in him! It is so sickening to almost hourly\r\ndip the pen in--mud! I regret now to have started this _Diary_. I go\r\non because it is started, and because I wish to contribute, even in\r\nthe smallest manner, towards rendering justice to a great people,\r\nbesides being always on the watch, always expecting to have to\r\nrecord a chain of brilliant actions, accomplished by noble and\r\neminent men. But day after day passes by, page heaps on page, and I\r\nmust criticise, when I would be so happy to prize.\r\n\r\nAs a watchdog faithful to the people's cause, I try to stir up the\r\nshepherds--but alas! alas....\r\n\r\n_May 22._--Wrote a letter to Senator Wade explaining to him how\r\nincapable is Hooker of commanding a large army, how his habits and\r\nassociations are contaminating and ruinous to the spirit of the\r\narmy, and that Hooker is to return to the command of a corps or two.\r\n\r\n_May 23._--Vainly! vainly in all directions, among the helmsmen,\r\nleaders and commanders I search for a man inspired, or, at least, an\r\nenthusiast wholly forgetting himself for the holiness of the aim.\r\nEnthusiasm is eliminated from higher regions; is outlawed, is almost\r\nspit upon. Enthusiasm! that most powerful stimulus for heart and\r\nreason, and which alone expands, purifies, elevates man's\r\nintellectual faculties. Here the people, the unnamed, have\r\nenthusiasm, and to the people belong those noble patriots so often\r\nmentioned. But the men in power are cold, and extinguished as ashes.\r\nJackson the President, Jackson the general, was an enthusiast.\r\nEnthusiasts have been the founders of this Republic.\r\n\r\nWhatever was done great and noble in this world, was done by\r\nenthusiasts. The whole scientific progress of the human mind is the\r\nwork of enthusiasm!\r\n\r\n_May 24._--Grant and the Western army before Vicksburgh unfold\r\nendurance, and fertility of resources, which, if shown by a\r\nMcClellan and his successors, having in their hands such a powerful\r\nengine as was and is the Potomac Army, would have made an end to the\r\nrebellion. Happy Grant, Rosecrans and their armies! to be far off\r\nfrom the deleterious Washington influences and adulations.\r\nInfluences and adulations ruined the commanders and many among the\r\ngenerals of the Potomac army. Adulations, intrigue, and helplessness\r\nfill, nay constitute the generals atmosphere. In various ways every\r\nbody contributes to that atmosphere--participates in it. Every body\r\ninfluences or intrigues in the army. The President, the various\r\nSecretaries, Senators, Congressmen, newspapers, contractors,\r\nsutlers, jobbers, politicians, mothers, wives, sisters, sweethearts\r\nand loose crinolines. Jews, publicans, etc., and the rest of social\r\nleprosy. All this cannot thus immediately and directly reach the\r\nWestern armies, the Western commanders, when it reaches, it is\r\nalready--to some extent--weakened, oxygenated, purified. Add to it\r\nhere the direct influence and meddling of the head-quarters. I pity\r\nthis fated army here, and at times I even pity the commanders and\r\nthe generals.\r\n\r\n_May 25._--Grant is an eminent man as to character and as to\r\ncapacity. To Admiral Foote and to him are due the victories at Fort\r\nHenry, of Donelson, and the bold stroke to enter into the interior\r\nof Secessia. Had Halleck not intervened, had Halleck and Buell not\r\ntaken the affairs in their hands, _Foote_ and _Grant_ would have\r\ntaken Nashville early in the spring of 1862, and cleared perhaps\r\nhalf of the Mississippi. After the capture of Fort Donelson, Foote\r\ndemanded to be allowed at once to go with his gunboats to Nashville,\r\nto clear the Tennessee; but Halleck caved in, or rather comprehended\r\nnot. Grant and Rosecrans restored what Halleck and Buell brought to\r\nthe brink of ruin.\r\n\r\n_May 28._--Mr. Seward, omnipotent in the White House, tries to\r\nconciliate the public, and in letters, etc., whitewashes himself\r\nfrom arrests of persons, etc. Mr. Seward is therefore innocent,\r\nthereof, as a lamb. But who inaugurated and directed them in 1861? I\r\nknow the necessities of certain times, and am far from accusing; but\r\nhow can Seward attempt to throw upon others the first steps made in\r\nthe direction of arrests?\r\n\r\n_May 28._--Hooker still in command, and not even his staff changed.\r\nI am certain that Stanton is for the change in the staff.\r\n\r\n_May 28._--I am assured that the Blairs (I am not sure if General\r\nBlair is counted in) are the pedlars for Mr. Lincoln's re-election,\r\nas stated by the New York _Herald_. If Mr. Lincoln is re-elected,\r\nthen the self-government is not yet founded on reason, intellect,\r\nand on sound judgment.\r\n\r\n_May 31._--I am assured by a diplomat that four hundred and thirteen\r\nis the last number of the correspondence between the Department of\r\nState and Lord Lyons. Oh, how much ink and paper wasted, and what a\r\nwriting dysentery on both sides. The diplomat in question added that\r\nit was only from January first--of course it was a joke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE, 1863.\r\n\r\n     Banks -- \"The Enemy Crippled\" -- Count Zeppelin --\r\n     Hooker-Stanton -- \"Give Him a Chance\" -- Mr. Lincoln's Looks --\r\n     Rappahannock -- Slaughter -- North Invaded -- \"To be Stirred up\"\r\n     -- Blasphemous Curtin -- Banquetting -- Desperate -- Groping --\r\n     Retaliation -- Foote -- Hooker -- Seward -- Panama -- Chase --\r\n     Relieved -- Meade -- Nobody's fault -- Staffs, etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 1._--For some time Banks seems to move in the right direction.\r\nBanks no more intends to destroy slavery, and not thereby to hurt\r\nthe slave-holders. So Banks has become himself again, and the\r\nSewardean creed is evaporated. Banks has under him very good\r\nofficers, and intelligent, fighting generals; some of them left by\r\nButler, others, as for instance, Generals Augur, Stone, etc., who\r\nembarked with Banks.\r\n\r\n_June 2._--I hear it reported that Hooker maintains that he has\r\nworsted and crippled the enemy more than if he had taken Richmond.\r\n\r\nIf the enemy in reality was worsted to that extent, it was not in\r\nthe least done by Hooker, Butterfield & Co.'s generalship, but this\r\ntime, as always, it was done by the bravery of the troops,\r\nnotwithstanding the bad generalship, not by, but _in spite of_, that\r\nbad generalship.\r\n\r\n_June 3._--Count Zeppelin, an officer of the staff and aide to the\r\nKing of Wurtemberg, came here to observe and to learn how _not_ to\r\ndo it! The Count visited the army at Falmouth. He was horror-struck\r\nat the prevailing disorder, and at the general and special\r\nmiscomprehension of the needed knowledge and of the duties\r\nprevailing in the staff of the army. The Count says that if this\r\nconfusion continues, the rebels may dare almost every thing. Count\r\nZeppelin is what would be called here, a thorough Union man. He\r\nrevolted greatly at witnessing the _nonchalance_ with which human\r\nlife is dealt with in the army, and the carelessness of commanders\r\nabout the condition of soldiers; the latter he most heartily\r\nadmires, and therefore the more pities their fate. He assured me\r\nthat rebel agents scattered in Germany tried their utmost to secure\r\nfor the rebel army officers of the various arms. This explains the\r\norganization and the brilliant manoeuvrings of the celebrated\r\nStuart's cavalry, the novel rebel tactics in the use of artillery,\r\nand the attack by columns at Chancellorsville.\r\n\r\n_June 3._--Hooker, they say, waits to see what Lee will do. In other\r\nwords, we are on the defensive, after such efforts and so much blood\r\nwasted. O, Ezekiel! O, Deuteronomy! help me to bless the leaders and\r\nthe chiefs of this people.\r\n\r\nI am told by a very good authority, that Mr. Lincoln takes a special\r\ncare of his fellow-townsmen in Springfield. What a good, honest,\r\nneighborly sentiment, provided always that the public good is not\r\nsuffering by it!\r\n\r\n_June 3._--A senator, who urged Mr. Lincoln to dismiss Halleck, was\r\nanswered, that \"as Halleck has not a single friend in the country,\r\nMr. Lincoln feels himself in duty bound to stand by him.\" Admirable,\r\nbut costly stubbornness.\r\n\r\n_June 3._--Poor Hooker! He is now the laughingstock of Europe. I\r\nwish he may recover what he has lost or squandered. But alas! even\r\nnow Hooker makes no attempt to surround himself with a genuine\r\nstaff.\r\n\r\nI wrote to Stanton, imploring him for the country's and for his own\r\nsake, to compel Hooker to reform his staff, and not to allow science\r\nto be any longer trodden under foot. I implored Stanton that either\r\nthe President or he would select and nominate a chief-of-staff for\r\nHooker, or rather for the Potomac army, as it is done in Europe.\r\nStanton understands well the disastrous deficiency, and if he could,\r\nhe would immediately go at it and change. But, first, the statutes\r\nor regulations, obligatory here, leave it with the commander to\r\nappoint his own staff and its chief. Stupid, rusty, foggyish and\r\nfogyish regulations, so perfectly in harmony with the general\r\nignorance of what ought to be the staff of an army! Second, Stanton\r\nmust yield to another will, and to what is believed here to be the\r\nhigher knowledge of military affairs.\r\n\r\n_June 3._--\"Give to Hooker one chance more,\" says Mr. Lincoln, and\r\nso say several members of the Cabinet; \"McClellan had so\r\nmany.\"--Because they allowed McClellan to waste human life and time,\r\nit surely is no reason to repeat the sacrilegious condescension. A\r\ngeneral may be unfortunate, lose a battle, or even lose a campaign;\r\nall this without being damnable when he has shown capacity, when he\r\ndid his utmost, but could not conciliate _fatum_ on his side. But\r\nsuch is not the case with Hooker, and such _emphatically_ was _not_\r\nthe case with McClellan and with Burnside.\r\n\r\n_June 3._--During these last fourteen days, the _big men_ have been\r\nexpecting a raid on Washington. More fortifications are constructed,\r\nand rifle pits dug. This time the Administration is perfectly right.\r\nAll is probable and possible when capacity, decision, and\r\nlightning-like execution are on the one side, and on the other\r\nsham-science, want of earnestness, slowness and indecision.\r\n\r\n_June 5._--A very reliable and honorable patriot tells me that\r\n_grandissimo_ Chase _looks down_ upon any advice, suggestion, or\r\nwarning. O, the great man! A time must come when all these great men\r\nwill be held to a terrible account, will shed tears of blood, and\r\ntheir names will be scorned by coming generations, and the track to\r\nthe White House may become also the track to the Tarpeian rock.\r\n\r\n_June 5._--I often meet Mr. Lincoln in the streets. Poor man! He\r\nlooks exhausted, care-worn, spiritless, extinct. I pity him! Mr.\r\nLincoln's looks are those of a man whose nights are sleepless, and\r\nwhose days are comfortless. That is the price for a greatness to\r\nwhich he is not equal. Yet Mr. Lincoln, they say, wishes to be\r\nre-elected!\r\n\r\n_June 5._--Mr. Seward makes a speech to the volunteers of Auburn.\r\nAll the same logomachy, all the same cold patriotism, all the same\r\n_I_, and all the same squint towards the next presidential election.\r\n\r\n_June 6._--Lincoln cannot realize to what extent Seward is and has\r\nbeen his evil spirit. Even the nearest in blood and heart to Lincoln\r\nknow it, feel it, are awe-struck by it, warn him, and he is\r\ninsensible.\r\n\r\n_June 7._--How I sympathize with Stanton, and admire his\r\nrude--others call it coarse--contempt of all that is said about him.\r\nThat impure, lying, McClellan-Copperhead motley crew, accuse Stanton\r\nof all the numberless criminal mistakes committed in the conduct of\r\nthe war--committed by the generals, etc. Stanton never interferes\r\nwith Mr. Lincoln nor with Halleck in matters that exclusively relate\r\nto pure warfare, as where and how to march the respective armies,\r\nhow and in what way to attack the enemy, etc.\r\n\r\nReliable patriots coincide with me, that Stanton as clearly sees\r\nevery thing to-day, as he saw it when entering on his thorny duty. I\r\nonly wonder that he holds out in such an atmosphere. Stanton's\r\nenergy is indomitable. Blair's party says that \"Stanton goes off at\r\nhalf-cock.\" It is not true; but even if true, better to go off at\r\nhalf-cock than not at all. Many say that Stanton ought to retire, if\r\nhe is hampered by others in the exercise of his duties. But if he\r\nwere to retire, he could not at this moment reveal to the people the\r\ncauses of such a step, and by remaining at his post, Stanton\r\nprevents still greater disasters and disgraces. He never asks any of\r\nhis friends to say or to write a word in his defence, or rather to\r\ndispel the lies with which McClellanites and copperheads poison the\r\natmosphere all around them.\r\n\r\n_June 8._--Alexandria fortified, rifle-pits dug, etc. The third\r\nyear of the war is the third terror upon Washington, and upon those\r\ncounterfeit penates.\r\n\r\n_June 8._--What for--for heaven's or devil's sake--Hooker throws a\r\ndivision of cavalry across the Rappahannock, right in the dragon's\r\njaw! All the rebel army is on the other side, and this, our\r\ndivision, can never be decidedly supported. It cannot be a\r\n_reconnaissance_--of what? It cannot be a stratagem to surprise Lee.\r\nIf Lee wants to march anywhere north or west, this demonstration of\r\nHooker's will not for a minute arrest Lee.\r\n\r\n_June 9._--The great Henry Ward Beecher emigrates for a time to\r\nEurope. His parish richly supports him for the trip, and the\r\npreacher sells his choice, and as it is said, beloved picture\r\ngallery. It is not for want of money. Strange! What a curious\r\nmanifestation of patriotism!\r\n\r\n_June 10._--The demonstration over the Rappahannock turned out to be\r\na slaughter of the cavalry. What! Was Hooker again stunned, to make\r\nsuch a deliberate mistake--nay, crime? Such a demonstration never\r\ncould prevent Stuart from moving, even if our troops had defeated or\r\nworried him--even if victorious, our cavalry would have been forced\r\nto recross the Rappahannock, and Stuart, having behind him Lee's\r\nwhole army, which could easily reinforce him, would then move again.\r\nOur force of nine thousand men, distant from support, attack a\r\nsuperior force of fifteen thousand, who besides have within\r\nsupporting distance a whole army! This demonstration prevents\r\nnothing, decides nothing, beyond the worst, the most damnable\r\ngeneralship. General Hooker and his chief-of-staff are personally\r\nresponsible for every soldier lost there.\r\n\r\n_June 11._--Again visitings to the army. Senators, ladies, magnifico\r\nChase leading on. O, if the guerrillas could sweep them!\r\n\r\n_June 12._--Crippled men are to be met in all directions, on all the\r\nstreets. One-third of the amputated limbs undoubtedly could have\r\nbeen saved by the Medical Department, were it in better hands, and\r\nabove all, if surgeons had been called in from Europe--the domestic\r\nsurgeons not being sufficient for the demand.\r\n\r\n_June 13._--The principle of election, the only true one, a principle\r\nrecognized and asserted as well by antiquity as by the primitive\r\nChurch, recognized by rationalists, by Fourier, by radical, or any\r\ndemocracy whatever--that principle must undergo an immense improvement\r\nbefore it shall act in all its perfection. The elector must be\r\naltogether self-governing, and not governed or influenced by anybody\r\nin his choice and vote. The elector himself must stand on an elevated\r\nlevel before by his vote he raises one or several above that level.\r\nWhen the people's vote confers the highest trust to one rather below\r\nthan in the level, and still less one above the level, then even the\r\nmost intelligent people in the world, being thus misdirected,\r\nmisconducted, confused, in a very short time become almost enervated,\r\nand, so to speak, loses its self-possession, and its sense of duty and\r\nof right becomes shaken, its intellectual light dimmed. _Exempla sunt\r\nodiosa._\r\n\r\n_June 14._--The cavalry expedition over the Rappahannock was to\r\narrest any further offensive movements of the rebels. But lo! the\r\nrebel army, so to speak, spreads in all directions, and takes the\r\noffensive. We do not even know positively where Lee is going, where\r\nhe will appear and strike. We are shaking in, and for, Washington.\r\n\r\n  \"Weh, Messina! wehe, wehe, wehe!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln is unshaken in his confidence in Hooker and Butterfield.\r\n\r\n_June 15._--By a bold and rapid manoeuvre Lee has thrown his troops\r\nover the valley, over the Potomac, into Maryland, and God alone\r\nknows where Lee will stop. Lee's advance must have been already on\r\nthe Potomac when the slaughter of our cavalry over the Rappahannock\r\nwas planned at the various head-quarters. How splendidly Lee's\r\nmovements have been arrested by that demonstration! Lee is on the\r\nPotomac, and it seems that his movements have been ignored. His\r\narmies, to be sure, have not been surrounded by a cloud, as the\r\nJews were in their exodus from the land of bondage, but the cloud\r\nwas hanging over the head-quarters in the army and in Washington.\r\n\r\n_June 16._--The North invaded--threatened, shaken to the marrow! The\r\naudacity of the rebels is stimulated by our sluggishness. If the\r\naccounts in the War Department are true, then from Fortress Monroe\r\nto the Potomac, including Baltimore and Maryland, we have about two\r\nhundred thousand men, and the rebels dare! O, the rebels! what a\r\ndesperate conception, what a lightning-like execution! Dutifully\r\nre-echoing the words uttered by their masters, the partisans of the\r\nAdministration console themselves by saying that \"this invasion of\r\nthe North will have the effect of stirring up the North from its\r\nlethargy.\" O, you blasphemers! worse blasphemers than ever have been\r\nstoned or burned alive! Is the North not pouring forth its blood and\r\nits treasures, and are they not all squandered by counterfeits?\r\n\r\n_June 16._--The draft is not put in motion, because for weeks and\r\nmonths Mr. Lincoln adjusts the appointments to be made under this\r\nlaw, adjusts them to the exigencies of politicians. Jeff Davis\r\nexecutes the draft with an iron hand. Mr. Lincoln thus gives time to\r\nthe Copperheads, to the disciples of the Seymours, of the Woods, of\r\nthe _World_, to organize a resistance. Bloodshed may come!\r\n\r\n_June 16._--This invasion of Pennsylvania ought to be investigated.\r\nLight must be brought into this dark, muddy, stinking labyrinth.\r\nWeeks ago, honest, clear-sighted, patriotic Governor Curtin asked\r\nauthority to arm the militia of his State, and was snubbed in\r\nWashington. Will this new disgrace serve to strengthen the\r\nAdministration? Quite possible.\r\n\r\n_June 16._--Pennsylvania invaded, the country disgraced, and our\r\nhelmsmen, our Secretaries of State and of the Treasury, give\r\nbanquets! O, what a stoicism! a stoicism _sui generis_. The homes of\r\nthe farmers whose sons bleed on fields of battle, are invaded, their\r\nhearths threatened with desolation, and the helmsmen sip Champagne,\r\npaid for by the people!\r\n\r\n_June 17._--_Halleckiana._ Rosecrans telegraphed to head-quarters\r\nthat he cannot send any troops to Grant, and that if he, Rosecrans,\r\nis to attack Bragg, he must have reinforcements. Answer: \"Do what\r\nyou like, on your own responsibility.\"\r\n\r\n_June 17._--Hooker seems to have lost his former _dash_. He must\r\nhave known that the rebels extended from Gordonsville to\r\nPennsylvania, and he, moving in almost a parallel direction to that\r\nline, ought to have cut it, or at least its tail.\r\n\r\nGeneral Ewell at Winchester. Hooker seems to doubt what he can do.\r\nThe soldiers of his army can do anything ever done by any soldiers\r\nin the world--but lead them on, O Generals! Hooker has ninety-four\r\nthousand men, and, McClellan-like, waits for more; laments that he\r\nis outnumbered. A good general, having such a number, and of such\r\ntroops, would never hesitate to attack an enemy numbering one\r\nhundred and twenty thousand, and the more so, as Hooker's command\r\nis massed, while Lee's is not. And I'll risk my head that Lee's\r\nwhole army, all over the valley, and over Pennsylvania, and over\r\nMaryland, is smaller than Hooker's. It is the same old trick of the\r\nrebels and of their friends, to throw dust in our eyes by magnifying\r\ntheir numbers. The trick is always successful, because on our side\r\nit is wished to extenuate incapacity by the supposed large numbers\r\nof the rebel armies.\r\n\r\n_June 18._--The North rises. New York sends its militia. The people\r\nfails not, but how about the helmsmen?\r\n\r\nThe Democrats--the Copperheads roar for McClellan. Well! the like\r\nDemocrats glorifying McClellan, show their patriotism, their metal\r\nand their judgment. These Copperhead-Democrats may insist upon\r\ncalling McClellan a captain and a hero, but history will give\r\nanother verdict, and history will credit to the Democrats the fact\r\nthat they have adroitly poisoned and perverted the good faith of the\r\nhonest but credulous Democratic rank and file.\r\n\r\n_June 18._--The Administration's _simon pure_ echoes, politicians,\r\netc., try to persuade everybody that the invasion of Pennsylvania is\r\nnothing, a mere tempest in a tea-pot. Whom do they hope to humbug in\r\nthis way? The disgrace is nameless, only they are callous enough not\r\nto feel it. Their cheeks can no more redden.... However, Stanton is\r\nnot so optimist. It would look so farcical if it were not so deadly\r\nto witness. Hooker groping his way after Lee; Lincoln and the\r\nall-knowing head-quarters in the utmost darkness about Lee, his\r\narmy, his movements, and his plans. And all this while the country,\r\nthe people, is kept officially ignorant of its honor, of its fate.\r\nAll publicity and communication is suppressed--not to inform thereby\r\nthe enemy of our movements. How idiotic, how silly! As if the march\r\nand the movements of an army of one hundred thousand men could be\r\nkept secret from a vigilant and desperate enemy, and the enemy\r\nwanted to read the papers for it. Good for us!\r\n\r\nI cannot hope against hope, and expect that Hooker, Butterfield,\r\nLincoln, Halleck will out-manoeuvre Lee, bold, quick, and desperate\r\nas he is.\r\n\r\n_June 19._--The jobbers, the contractors, the gold, stock, and\r\nexchange speculators wish for the prolongation of the war. For this\r\nreason, disasters are rather welcome to them. Oh! to crush those\r\nignoble and demoniac monsters.\r\n\r\n_June 20._--I cannot comprehend how Lee could have dared such a\r\ndesperate movement, even if relying on the confusion and\r\nsenselessness prevailing in _our_ military movements. Lee must have\r\nhad some kind of encouragement from the Copperheads before he risked\r\na step, which ought to end in his utter destruction, even with a\r\nHalleck, Hooker and Butterfield as our commanders.\r\n\r\n_June 20._--Hooker has more than ninety thousand men in hand--his\r\nrear, his supplies, his _depots_ covered by Heintzelman, and by the\r\ndefences of Washington. This alone is equal to fifty thousand more.\r\nAnd with all this, the treble head-quarters, in the White House in\r\nG street, and in the army cannot find Lee, and therefore the rebels\r\nare not attacked, and lay Pennsylvania waste. O, staffs, O, staffs!\r\n\r\n_June 20._--More than any other army in the world, the American army\r\nrequires to have a thoroughly organized staff, with very intelligent\r\nstaff officers. Such staff officers carry orders to generals and to\r\ncolonels who, although brave and devoted, may often not altogether\r\ncomprehend certain sacramental technicalities of an order delivered\r\nby mouth, or written briefly in the saddle.\r\n\r\nThe officer ought to be able to explain the order. Think of it, you\r\nwiseacres and organisers of American armies.\r\n\r\n_June 21._--Small cavalry skirmishes without signification. The\r\ncurtain is not rended, and the enemy rolls towards the heart of\r\nPennsylvania. How will it end?\r\n\r\n_June 22._--Nobody of the various upper and lower Chiefs can find\r\nLee. Give twenty thousand men to a bold man even not a general, and\r\nin twenty-four hours he will bring you positive news about Lee's\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n_June 23._--It seems that Lee waits, if we divide our army, to\r\nstrike a blow on Washington. Thus he will be baffled; there is a\r\nlimit even to our military blunders.\r\n\r\n_June 24._--Incorrigible Seward. France invites our Government to\r\nparticipate in the diplomatic coercion against Russia. Of course,\r\nAmericans refuse. Mr. Seward, in harmony with the feeling of the\r\npeople politely snuff off France. But O, Mr. Seward, why pervert\r\nhistory or show your ignorance, even of the national events and of\r\nCongressional records. The United States, Adams II., President, sent\r\ncommissioners to the Congress of Panama, and the United States\r\nCongress did it after a discussion of several days. What is the use\r\nto deny it now? Then Mr. Seward is insincere to both parties.\r\nSpeaking of \"_a temporary transient revolt here_\" he seemingly\r\ninsinuates, that but for this _transient revolt_ he would perhaps\r\ntry his hand at the European game. It would look so grand to be in\r\ncompany with the _Decembriseur_. Then the only impediment would be\r\nthe people's will different from yours, oh, Seward! _The refusal_ in\r\nthe dispatch re-echoes the convictions of the American people; its\r\nshilly-shally conditionality is exclusively Sewardism and only fit\r\nto catch a Russian diplomat in Washington.\r\n\r\n_June 25._--Hooker crosses to Maryland with nearly one hundred\r\nthousand men. Lee is still on both sides of the Potomac. By a blow\r\nHooker could cut Lee's army, break it, and retrieve what he lost at\r\nChancellorsville. Oh, how I wish he may do it. But since Hooker has\r\nrefused to mend his staff, all hope is lost. Stanton sees the\r\ncondition very clearly, but Butterfield is in good odor in the White\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n_June 26._--Lee's movements and invasion puzzle me more and more.\r\nThe raid into Pennsylvania is the move of a desperate commander,\r\nalmost of a madman, playing his whole fortune on one card. If Lee\r\ncomes safe out of it, then doubtless he is the best general of our\r\ntimes, and we the best nincompoops that ever the sun looked upon and\r\nblushed for.\r\n\r\n_June 26._--The reports give to Lee an army of two hundred thousand\r\nmen. Impossible! Where could the rebels scrabble together such a\r\nnumber? The old trick to frighten us. If, however, Lee should have\r\neven only from one hundred to one hundred and fifty thousand, then\r\nrelying on the high capacity of our various head-quarters, the rebel\r\nchiefs may have gathered what they could take from Charleston and\r\nfrom Bragg, and massed it to try a decided blow on Washington. But\r\nthis cloud, this dust cannot last long; whatever be our\r\nhead-quarters, light must come, and the cloud burst with blood and\r\nthunder.\r\n\r\nOne meets in Washington individuals praising sky-high Mr. Lincoln's\r\nmilitary capacity, and saying that he alone embraces all the\r\nextensive line of military operations, combines, directs them, etc.\r\nPretty well has all this succeeded, and why cannot the younger\r\ngeneration seize the helm in this terrible crisis? How I ardently\r\nwish to see there an Andrew, Boutwell, Coffey, and more, more of\r\nthose new men.\r\n\r\n_June 27._--From a very reliable, honest, and _not conspiring_\r\nsecessionist in Washington, I learn that a Northern Copperhead\r\nvisited Jeff Davis in Richmond, and stimulated the rebel chief to\r\ncarry into the north a war of retaliation by fire and sword, but\r\nthat Jeff Davis refused to instruct Lee for devastation. I instantly\r\ntold Stanton my news; and now I doubt not in the least that the\r\ninvasion is concerted with Northern Copperheads.\r\n\r\n_June 28._--The following is this morning the military condition of\r\nthe city with the forts and defences: Hooker took all he could and\r\nall he met on his way. To defend the works around Washington\r\nHeintzelman has six thousand infantry, and not two hundred cavalry.\r\nThe rebels have cavalry all around, within six or eight miles. A\r\ndash of twenty thousand infantry, and Washington is done!\r\n\r\n_June 28._--Admiral Foote dead. Irreparable loss. Foote was of the\r\nstamp of Lyon, of the stamp of patriot-heroes. He died of\r\nexhaustion, that is, of devotion to the country. Foote was an honor\r\nto the navy and to the American people.\r\n\r\n_June 28._--Yesterday, Friday, the candidate for presidency,\r\nsplendid Chase, stood up mightily for Hooker. Oh, Mr. Chase! you may\r\nbe a great or a doubtful financier, but keep rather mute on military\r\nmatters. You know as much about them as this d---- mosquito that is\r\njust now biting my nose.\r\n\r\n_June 28._--At last, Hooker relieved. I pity Meade to receive a\r\ncommand at such a critical moment. But now or never, to show his\r\nmettle, his capacity! The army thinks very highly of Meade. Will\r\nHalleck soon be sent to California? Then the country's cause will be\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\n_June 29._--Yesterday a rebel cavalry raid captured an immense\r\ntrain of provisions, cattle, etc., worth about five hundred thousand\r\ndollars, and within eight or twelve miles of Washington! Of course,\r\nit is nobody's fault. In other armies and countries, such a large\r\ntrain would have a very strong convoy--here it had scarcely a small\r\nsquadron of cavalry. The original fault is, first, with Hooker's\r\nchief-of-staff, who is responsible for providing the army, and for\r\nthe security of the provision trains. So at least it is in European\r\narmies. Second, with the head-quarters at Washington, who ought to\r\nhave known that the enemy, ant-like, spreads in the rear of Hooker.\r\nThe head-quarters ought to have informed the quartermaster thereof,\r\nand provided a strong convoy. This train affair is the younger\r\nbrother of the Fredericksburg pontoons.\r\n\r\nThird, the head-quarters of the army and the quartermasters ought to\r\nhave inquired at the head-quarters of the defenses of Washington, if\r\nthe roads are safe. But of course it was not done, as the _big men_\r\nhere possess all the prescience, and need no valuable information.\r\nAll of them appear to me as ostriches, who hide their heads and\r\neyes, not to see the danger.\r\n\r\n_June 29._--General Heintzelman is as thorough a soldier as any\r\nto-day in Washington--a soldier superior to head-quarters of the\r\narmy. Heintzelman commands the military district which south, west\r\nand north touches on the theatre of the present campaign. In similar\r\nconditions and circumstances, any other government, sovereign,\r\ncommander-in-chief, etc., would consult with the commander of the\r\ndefences of the capital and of the military district around the\r\ncity; here Heintzelman is not noticed.\r\n\r\n_June 30._--How will Meade compose his staff? All depends on that.\r\nIn the present positions of Meade's and Lee's armies, even a\r\nNapoleon could not do much without a very good staff.\r\n\r\nWere the staffs of the American armies organized as they are in\r\nEurope, no difficulty would exist. In Europe the staffs of the\r\narmies are independent from the persons of their commanders. When a\r\ncommander is changed, the staff and its chief remains, and thus the\r\nnew commander at a glance and in a few hours can become thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with the position and condition of the army, and with the\r\nplans of his predecessor, etc., etc. Often such commanders are\r\nchanged and sent from one end of the country to the other. In 1831,\r\nPASCHKEWITSCH was ordered from the Caucasus to Poland, to supersede\r\nDIESBITSCH.\r\n\r\n_June 30._--Since Calhoun, the creed of the _simon pure_ Democratic\r\nparty intrinsically marked a degradation of man and of humanity. Its\r\nlogical, unavoidable and final outlets must have been secession,\r\ntreason, and copperheadism; its apotheosis, South, the rebels;\r\nNorth, the Woods, the Seymours, the Vallandighams and the _World_.\r\nThe creed of the Republican party is humane. The _simon pure_\r\ndemocratic rank and file, North and South, intellectually and\r\nmorally constitute the lowest stratum of American society. Progress,\r\ncivilization, intellectual, healthy activity principally are\r\nembodied in the Republican rank and file. True men, as a Marcy, a\r\nGuthrie, and some few similar, throw a pure and bright light on the\r\nDemocratic party; many from among the official and political\r\nRepublican notabilities throw a dismal and dark shadow on the\r\nintrinsically elevated and pure principles of the party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJULY, 1863.\r\n\r\n     Eneas -- Anchises -- General Warren -- Aldie -- General\r\n     Pleasanton -- Superior mettle -- Gettysburgh -- Cholera morbus --\r\n     Vicksburgh -- Army of heroes -- Apotheosis -- \"Not name the\r\n     Generals\" -- Indian warfare -- Politicians -- Spittoons -- Riots\r\n     -- Council of War -- Lords and Lordlings -- Williamsport -- Shame\r\n     -- Wadsworth -- \"To meet the Empress Eugénie,\" etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 1._--It is worth while to ascertain if the Administration is\r\nprepared to run. During last year's invasion of Maryland, at the\r\nfoot of C street a swift vessel was, day and night, kept under\r\nsteam--(in the greatest secrecy)--to carry away the American gods.\r\n_Eneas-Seward_ was to carry on his shoulders ANCHISES-LINCOLN. I was\r\ntold that certain gallant secretaries promised to certain gallant\r\n_ladies_ to take them into the ark.\r\n\r\n_July 1._--Meade makes General Warren his chief-of-staff. For the\r\nfirst time in this war, in-doors and out-doors, a man for the place.\r\nI never saw Warren, but have heard much in his favor. Then he is\r\nyoung. Then he is not conceited. Then he is no intriguer. Then he\r\nis fighting always and everywhere. Then he speaks not of strategy. A\r\nbrighter promise. Genuine science and intelligence dawn on our\r\nmuddy, dark, ignorant horizon.\r\n\r\nFour weeks ago Meade might have been already in the command of the\r\narmy. (See after Chancellorsville.) Perhaps Lee would have been\r\nto-day shut up in Richmond instead of laying waste Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n_July 1._--The people will never know to what extent Mr.\r\nLincoln-Halleck are stumbling-blocks in all military affairs. If\r\nLincoln had even a _Carnot_ for Secretary of War, the affairs would\r\nnot go better than they go now.\r\n\r\n_July 1._--General Meade is the pure, simple result of military\r\nnecessity. His choice is not adulterated by any party spirit.\r\nSuccess may be probable, if Meade is in reality what his colleagues\r\nsuppose or assert him to be.\r\n\r\n_July 2._--The property of the great patriot THADDEUS STEVENS\r\ndestroyed by the rebels. I am as sure as of my existence, that the\r\nrebel hordes were urged by the Copperheads and by Northern traitors,\r\nby the disciples of the _World_, etc.\r\n\r\n_July 2._--Copperheads and their organs scream to have McClellan at\r\nthe head of the armies. This enthusiasm for McClellan soon will be a\r\nburning shame. For many it is a mental disease, and almost\r\nunparallelled in the history of our race. A man of defeats and of\r\nincapacity to be thus worshipped as a hero! To what extent sound\r\nintellects can become poisoned by lies! O, Democrats! what a kin and\r\nkith you are! The stubborn, undaunted bravery of the people keeps\r\nthe country above water, when McClellan and his medley of believers\r\ndragged and drags her down into the abyss. Soon infamy will cover\r\nthe names of those who wail for McClellan's glory, the names of\r\nthese deliberate betrayers of the people's good faith.\r\n\r\n_July 2._--Count Zeppelin was at the cavalry fight at Aldie. In his\r\nappreciation, General Pleasanton is almost the ideal of a general of\r\ncavalry, in the manner in which he fought his forces. The Count says\r\nthat our soldiers are by far superior to the rebels, that our\r\nregiments, squadrons, showed the utmost bravery, that in\r\nsingle-handed _mélés_ our soldiers showed a superior mettle, and\r\nthat during the whole fight he did not see a single soldier back out\r\nor retire.\r\n\r\nCount Zeppelin spent three weeks with Hooker. The Count _never_ saw\r\nHooker intoxicated, but nevertheless, he does not believe Hooker to\r\nbe the man for the command of a large army. The Count, an educated\r\nofficer of staff, deplores the utter absence of that special science\r\nin the heads of the staff.\r\n\r\nThe Count was with the army during its march from Falmouth to\r\nFrederick. He admires the endurance, the good spirit, and the\r\ncohesion shown by the army marching under great difficulties, such\r\nas bad roads, heat, &c.\r\n\r\n_July 2._--News of fight at Gettysburgh. It seems that this time a\r\nplan was boldly conceived, and carried out with rapidity and\r\nbravery. It seems that _now a general_ commands, and has at his side\r\n_a chief-of-staff_.\r\n\r\n_July 2._--A crystalized section of abolitionists has, it seems,\r\ndispatched to England a Rev. Dr. _Conway_, who put on airs, began a\r\nsilly correspondence with Mason the traitor, and has thrown ridicule\r\non the cause and on the men whom he is supposed to represent.\r\n\r\n_July 3._--Some details from Gettysburgh. Most sanguinary and\r\nstubborn fighting. General Reynolds, the flower of our army, killed.\r\nThe unblemished patriot, General Wadsworth, fought most splendidly,\r\nand is reported to be wounded. His son was beside Reynolds. Mark\r\nthis, you world's offals in the WORLD. Nothing like you can be found\r\nin the purlieus of the most stinking social sewers.\r\n\r\n_July 3._--Whoever wishes to know how, in Mr. Seward's mind, right\r\nand law are equipoised, should read the correspondence between the\r\nState Department and the Attorney-General in the case of a criminal\r\nrunaway from Saxony. _Astraea-Themis_-BATES is always bold and manly\r\nwhen right, justice, when individual or general human rights are\r\nquestioned. BATES' official, legal opinions will remain as a noble\r\nrecord of his official activity during this bloody tornado.\r\n\r\n_July 3._--Most contradictory news and rumors. To a great extent,\r\nthe fortunes of the Union may be decided at Gettysburgh. Copperheads\r\nalias Peace-Democrats more dangerous than the rebels in arms. The\r\nCopperheads poisoned and paralyzed the spirit of the people; the\r\nPennsylvanians look on, and rise not as a man in the defence of\r\ntheir invaded state.\r\n\r\n_July 4._--General Wallbridge the orator of the day. _O tempora\r\nLincolniana!_\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate for the country and for General Meade that no\r\ntelegraphic communication exists between Washington and his camp.\r\n\r\n_July 8._--July 4th, in the evening, I was struck with _cholera\r\nmorbus_. In two hours I was delirious, and the end of the DIARY and\r\nof myself was at hand. Those who may be interested in the DIARY, be\r\nthankful to _fatum_ and to my friend in whose house I was taken\r\nsick. I am up and again on the watch.\r\n\r\n_July 8._--However, I have lost the run of events. I have lost the\r\n_piquant_ of observation how the events of Gettysburgh affected the\r\n_big men_ here. I may have lost the echo of some stories told on the\r\noccasion at the White House.\r\n\r\nVicksburgh taken! No words to glorify GRANT, FARRAGUT, PORTER, _and\r\nthe army of heroes on land and on the waters_.\r\n\r\nI wake up and open a paper. Apotheosis! Yesterday evening Mr. Seward\r\nmade a speech and glorified himself into CHRIST. Why not? At the\r\nbeginning of this internecine war, Mr. Seward repeatedly played the\r\ninspired, the prophet, and even the SPIRIT, having the polyglotic\r\ngift. _In illo tempore_ Mr. Seward advised the foreign diplomats to\r\nbring to him their respective dispatches received from their\r\nrespective governments, and he, Seward, would explain to each\r\ndiplomat the meanings of what the dispatches contain. Perhaps the\r\nspirit was an after-dinner spirit!\r\n\r\nIn the above-mentioned speech Mr. Seward exclaimed, \"If I fall!\" O,\r\nyou will fall, and you will be covered with ... I shall not stain\r\nthe paper. Plenty of lickspittles glorifying Lincoln-Seward.\r\n\r\n_July 8._--The battles at Gettysburgh will stand almost unparalleled\r\nin history for the courage, tenacity, and martial rage shown on both\r\nsides, by the soldiers, the officers and the generals. This\r\nfour-days' struggle may be put above Attila's fight in the plains of\r\nChalons; it stands above the celebrated battle of giants at Marignan\r\nbetween the French and the Swiss. No legions, no troops ever did\r\nmore, nay, ever did the same. At Waterloo one-third of the French\r\ninfantry was not engaged in the previous days of Ligny and of\r\nQuatres-bras, and three-fourths of the Anglo-allied army were fresh,\r\nand not fatigued even by forced marches. I am sure that no other\r\ntroops in the world could fight with such a stubborn bravery four\r\nconsecutive days; not the English, not even the _iron-muscled_\r\nRussians.\r\n\r\nI learn that during the invasion of Pennsylvania, and above all,\r\nduring the last days, all the country expected something\r\nextraordinary from the army at Fortress Monroe, under General Dix's\r\ncommand. But the affair ended in expectations.\r\n\r\nA few days ago the President declared in a speech that he dares not\r\nintroduce the names of the generals. Not to name the victor at\r\nGettysburgh, the undaunted captor of Vicksburgh! The people repeat\r\nyour names, O heroes! even if the President remains dumb.\r\n\r\nAlready a back-fire against Meade. I cannot believe that his heart\r\nfainted, and that other generals kept him from breaking before the\r\nenemy. But Meade is the man of their own kith and kin, and they\r\nought to have known him.\r\n\r\nIt is now so difficult to disentangle truth from lies, from stories\r\nand from intrigue. It will not do, however, to uphold Hooker--it\r\nwill not do. Hooker is a brilliant fighter, but was and always will\r\nbe _stunned_ when in command of an army. It is a crime to put up\r\nHooker as a captain.\r\n\r\nSomebody put in the head of the patriotic but mercurial Senator\r\nWilson that the terrible onslaught of the rebel columns is not the\r\nresult of their having adopted European, continental tactics, but\r\nthat the rebels are formidable because they have adopted the Indian\r\nmode of warfare. God forgive him who thus confused my friend's\r\nunderstanding! Indian tactics or warfare for masses of forty, fifty,\r\nor one hundred thousand men!\r\n\r\nI learn that Christ-Seward wishes to force the hoary, but brave,\r\nsteady, and not at all fogyish Neptune WELLES, to recognize to Spain\r\nor Cuba, or to somebody else and to all the world, an extension of\r\nthe maritime league. It is excellent. Such extension is _altogether_\r\nadvantageous to the maritime neutrals--all of them, Russia excepted,\r\nour covert or open ill-wishers.\r\n\r\nMr. Seward, as a good, scriptural Christian, minds not an offense,\r\nand is not rancorous. The Imperial _Decembriseur_, and all the\r\nimperialist liveried lackeys, look with contempt on the cause of the\r\npeople, side with secessionists, with copperheads, etc., etc., and\r\nMr. Seward insists on giving a license for the exportation of\r\ntobacco bought in Richmond for French accounts. Again Neptune\r\ndefends the country's honor and interests.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the presidential electioneering season approaches,\r\nMr. Seward repeatedly and repeatedly attempts to impress upon the\r\npeople's mind that he will not accept from the nation any high\r\nreward for his services. Well, it is not cunning--as by this time\r\nMr. Seward ought to have found in what estimation he is held by\r\nnine-tenths of the people.\r\n\r\nThis is all that I caught in one day, after several days'\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\n_July 9._--Lee retreats towards the Potomac. If they let him recross\r\nthere, our shame is nameless. Will Meade be after Lee _l'épée dans\r\nles reins_.\r\n\r\n_Halleckiana, minus._ Nobody in Washington, not even the\r\nhead-quarters, has any notion or idea what means Lee has to recross\r\nthe Potomac.\r\n\r\n_Halleckiana, plus._ I am told that Halleck refused to telegraph to\r\nMeade Mr. Lincoln's strategical conceptions.\r\n\r\n_July 9._--Chewing and spitting paramount here, require incalculable\r\nnumbers of spittoons. The lickspittles outnumber the spittoons.\r\n\r\n_July 10._--The politicians already begin to broadly _play their\r\ngame_. I use the sacramental expressions. What a disgusting\r\nmonstrosity is a thorough politician! Not even a eunuch! There is\r\nnothing in a politician to be emasculated: no mind, no heart, no\r\nmanhood. In what a _galere_ I got--not by personal contact--but by\r\nintellectually observing the worms on the body politic of my--at any\r\nrate heartily adopted--country.\r\n\r\n_July 11._--Repeatedly and repeatedly certain newspaper\r\ncorrespondents announce to the world that Senator Sumner exercises\r\nconsiderable influence on the supreme power. All things considered,\r\nI wish it may be so, but I see it is not. Sumner's influence ought\r\nto have produced some palpable results. I see none.\r\n\r\nThe international maritime complications are watched and defeated\r\nby Welles.\r\n\r\n_Drapez vous, messieurs, drapez vous_--in the statesman toga,\r\nhistory and truth will take it off from your shoulders.\r\n\r\n_July 12._--Mr. Seward is very ardently at work--Weed marshaling\r\nSeward--to reconstruct slavery and Union, to give a very large if\r\nnot a general amnesty to the rebels, to shake hands with them, in\r\npursuance of the Mercier-Richmond programme, and to be carried into\r\nthe White House on the shoulders of the grateful Union-saviours,\r\nCopperheads, and blood-stained traitors. The _Herald_, the _World_,\r\nthe _National Intelligencer_ and others of that creed will sing\r\n_gloria in excelsis_ to Seward.\r\n\r\n_July 13._--What is _Meade_ doing? It is exciting to know why a blow\r\nis not yet dealt on the head of retreating rebels. Or is it that\r\nthough West Point generals--on both sides--tolerably understand how\r\nto fight a battle, they subside when the finishing stroke is to be\r\ndealt. Oh for a general who understands how to manoeuvre against the\r\nenemy!!!\r\n\r\nI hear from a very reliable source, that during the excitement\r\nbrewing before the day of Gettysburgh, the honorable Post Master\r\nGeneral by a special biped message insinuated to the honorable\r\ngovernor of New York that the governor may ask the removal of\r\nStanton for the safety of the country and of patriots of the\r\nPostmaster's and the governor's species.\r\n\r\n_July 13._--Besides what _Meade_ has in hand, there must be a\r\nconsiderable number of troops in Baltimore, in Fortress Monroe and\r\nthe volunteer militia. Why not, Lincoln-Halleck! mass them on the\r\nsouth side of the Potomac under such generals as Heintzelman, Sigel,\r\netc., and take the enemy between two fires?\r\n\r\n_July 14._--Bloody riots in New York. The teaching of the Woods, of\r\ntheir former hireling, the _World_, and of those who pay that offal\r\nnow. Seymour's democracy; mob, pillage, massacre.\r\n\r\n_July 14._--Lincoln has nominated so many Major-Generals who are\r\nrelieved from duty, so many of them, that the Major-Generals ought\r\nto be formed into a squadron, and, Halleck at the head, McClellan at\r\nthe tail, make them charge on Lee's centre. In such a way the\r\nmajor-generals would be some use.\r\n\r\n_July 14._--I meet many who attempt to exculpate Mr. Seward from\r\n_this_ or _that_ untruth which he is accused having told to the\r\nPresident. Such _Seward's_ men often contradict not the fact, but\r\nattempt to insinuate that somebody else might have told it. To all\r\nthis I answer with the Roman Prætor:\r\n\r\n  _Ille fecit cui prodest_\r\n\r\n_July 14._--GRANT has overpowered men, soil--and elements. GRANT,\r\nPORTER, FARRAGUT, and their men overpowered land and waters. They\r\noverpowered _the Mississippi_, hear: the Mississippi's and its\r\nmighty affluents as the Yazoo, the Red River, and others. McClellan\r\ncaved in before a brook, as the Chickahominy. McClellan had the\r\nmost gigantic resources in men and material ever put in the hands of\r\na commander, and caved in. O, worshippers of heavy incapacity, take\r\nand digest it if you can.\r\n\r\n_July 16._--Lee re-crossed the Potomac! Thundering storms, rising\r\nwaters and about one hundred and fifty thousand at his heels! What a\r\ngeneral! And our brave soldiers again baffled, almost dishonored by\r\ndomestic, know-nothing generalship. We have lost the occasion to crush\r\nthree-fourths of the rebellion. But where is the responsibility? Foul\r\nwork somewhere, but, as always, it will be nobody's fault.\r\n\r\n_July 15._--Stanton in rage and despair. Riots everywhere. All these\r\nriots must be the result of a skillfully laid mine. They coincide\r\nwith the invasion by the rebels. At the best, these riots are\r\ngenerated by Fourth of July Seymourite speeches and by the long\r\nuninterrupted series of incendiary articles in New York papers, like\r\nWorld, etc., and in Boston, where emasculated parasites as Hilliard,\r\na Cain Curtis etc., soothingly tried their hands to disgrace their\r\ncity and to mislead the people. All the Lincoln-Seward-Halleck\r\nactions cannot excuse these riots and their matricidal, secret\r\ninciters.\r\n\r\n_July 15._--The Administration ought to recall Wool and put Butler\r\nin New York. Butler understands how to deal with riotous traitors.\r\n\r\n_July 15._--Good news from Banks. Now he comes out and will recover\r\nthe confidence of all good men.\r\n\r\n_July 15._--If it is true that _Meade_ convoked a council of war,\r\nand that the generals decided not to attack Lee, then whoever voted\r\nand decided so, ought, at the best, to be sent to the hospital of\r\nmental invalids, and the army put in the hands of fighting men.\r\nLee's escape will henceforth occupy the cardinal place in the annals\r\nof disgraceful generalships of the Potomac army.\r\n\r\n_July 16._--One of the truest men and citizens in this country,\r\nGeorge Forbes, of Milton Hill, returned from England. Forbes says\r\nthat aristocracy and the commercial classes (with few exceptions)\r\nare generally against us. But the people at large are on our side.\r\n\r\nOh! that some method may be found to separate the interests of the\r\ngood and noble English people, from the interests of the other\r\nclasses; then to have intercourse only with the people; and towards\r\nthe other English fulfil:\r\n\r\n  _Vos autem o Tyrii prolem gentemque futuram,_\r\n\r\nand that not one of those lords, lordlings, of inborn snobs and\r\nflunkeys, that not one of that English social sham may ever be\r\nallowed to tread the sacred American soil. And if such an Englishman\r\never touches these shores, then be he treated as leprous, and as\r\ncarrying in him the most contagious plague, and let the house of any\r\nAmerican that shall be opened to such an Englishman, be torn down\r\nand burned, and its ashes scattered to the winds; and the curse of\r\nthe people upon any American harboring those snobbish upstarts of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\n_July 16._--The incendiaries and murderers in New York cheered\r\nMcClellan and came to his house. Bravo! Can, now, any honest man who\r\nis not an idiot, doubt where are the main springs and the animus of\r\nthose New York blood-thirsty miscreants, and who are those of whose\r\nhearts McClellan got hold? What a nice Copperhead combination for\r\nsaving the Union. Very likely Seymour, Dictator or President,\r\nMcClellan Commander-in-chief, or Secretary of War, some of the Woods\r\nor Duncans or Barlows in the Treasury, their hireling any Marble for\r\nForeign Affairs, and with them some others from among the favorites\r\nof the New York blood-thirsty incendiaries.\r\n\r\nI read in one of the New York poison-dealers, _alias_ Copperhead\r\nnewspapers, that McClellanites was ruined by politicians. So-called\r\nhonest, but idiotic conservatives sanctimoniously repeat that lie.\r\nIt was McClellan, who, inspired by _Barlow_, by the _Herald_ and by\r\nhis aristocratic West Point pro-slavery friends, introduced\r\ndemocratic politics into the army at a time when the army was yet in\r\nan embryo state, already in September and October, 1861. O, impudent\r\nliars! history will nail your names to the gallows, together with\r\nthe name of your fetish and of his military tail.\r\n\r\n_July 16._--In that fated, cursed council of war which allowed Lee\r\nto escape, my patriot WADSWORTH was the most decided, the most\r\nout-spoken in favor of attacking Lee. Wadsworth never fails where\r\nhonor and patriotism are to be sustained. Warren with Wadsworth. So\r\nHumphries, Pleasanton and Howard. Those names ought to coruscate as\r\nthe purest light of patriotism for future generations. Meade's vote\r\nis of no account. He, the commander, ought to have acted up to his\r\nvote. If only Meade had imitated _Radetzky_. In 1849 after the\r\ndenunciation of the Armistice of Milan, _Radetzky_ called a council\r\nof war to decide whether the _Po_ was to be crossed and Piedmont\r\ninvaded. All the best Austrian generals--_Hesse_ with them, voted\r\nagainst the proposition. Radetzky quietly listened, then rose and\r\ngive orders to cross immediately.\r\n\r\nThe result was the battle of Novara and the temporary humiliation of\r\nthe house of Savoy. That was a model for _Meade_. And this General\r\n_French_ who advised to entrench! To entrench in pursuit of a\r\nretreating enemy! This French honors West Point and engineering. The\r\ngenerals who voted to entrench and not to attack Lee, and Meade with\r\nthem, they can never, never retrieve. Whatever be their future or\r\neventual success it will not heal the wound given to the country by\r\nthus allowing Lee to escape. O, God! O, God!\r\n\r\nSuch _Frenches_ and others asserted that \"Lee will attack before he\r\ncrosses.\" Oh what _Marses!_ _Lee's position at Williamsport was on\r\nheights_, etc., etc., assert those braves.\r\n\r\nWhen a country is hilly and undulating there will always be found\r\none point or hill commanding the others. I shall risk my head on the\r\nfact, that around Lee's entrenchments at Williamsport, there exist\r\nother elevations which command Williamsport, and are within\r\nartillery distance. _Natura semper sibi consona._ I am sure that\r\nbetter positions than that selected by Lee could easily have been\r\noccupied by our troops or artillery. The same must have been the\r\ncase at Hagerstown. And if the generals were afraid to fight Lee's\r\nwhole army they ought to have more vigilantly watched his crossing.\r\nThere was a time when a part only of the rebel army was facing us,\r\nand at least this part ought to have been attacked and crippled, if\r\nnot destroyed. Sound common sense teaches it. But it seems that no\r\nwill to fight Lee, or to impede his safe recrossing, no such will\r\nanimated the majority of the council of war. It seems that some of\r\nthe West Point nurslings are still awe-struck at the sight of their\r\nslavocratic former companions, as they were at the time of their\r\nstudies at West Point.\r\n\r\nI was told by an officer coming from the army that the soldiers are\r\nexasperated. The soldiers say that the generals did not wish to\r\ndestroy Lee's army and finish the rebellion, because their \"stars\r\nwere to set down.\" Who knows how far the soldiers are right?\r\n\r\n_July 17._--In New York the _unterrified_ democracy went to arson\r\nand murder, hand in hand with the immense majority of Irishry.\r\nMeagher, Nugent, Corcoran and thousands like you, are exceptions.\r\nThe O'Connors, O'Gormans, etc., are the unterrified. For these\r\nbloody saturnalia the wedding was consecrated by the Iro-Roman\r\npriesthood. As the _unterrified_ Democrats pollute the sacred name\r\nof genuine Democracy, so the Irishry stain even the Catholic\r\nconfession. The Iro-Roman Church in this country is not even a\r\nRoman-Catholic end. This Iro-Romanism here is a mixture of cunning,\r\nignorance, brutality and extortion. A European Roman-Catholic at\r\nonce finds out the difference in the spirit, and even to a certain\r\nextent, in the form. The incendiaries and murderers in the New York\r\nriots are the nurslings and disciples of the Iro-Roman clergy and\r\nthe Iro-hierarchy.\r\n\r\n_July 17._--Mr. Lincoln ought to dismiss every general who voted\r\nagainst fighting; dismiss _Meade_ for not understanding his power as\r\ncommander of an army, and give the places to such Howards, Warrens,\r\nPleasantons, Humphreys, Wadsworths, and all others, generals,\r\ncolonels, etc. who clamorously asked an order for attack. If the\r\narmy shall depend upon such generals who let Lee escape, then lay\r\ndown arms, and drag not the people's children to a slaughter house.\r\n\r\nTo excuse the generals, it is asserted that at Chancellorsville Lee\r\nhas allowed to Hooker to recross the river without annoying us,\r\nwhich Lee could easily do, and damage us considerably. Well! are our\r\nGenerals to carry on a mere war of civilities? If Lee committed a\r\nfault, are you, gentlemen, in duty bound to imitate his mistakes?\r\nImitation for imitation, then rather imitate Lee's several splendid\r\nmanoeuvring and tactics.\r\n\r\n_July 17._--I learn that the deep-dyed Copperheads and\r\nslavery-saviours do not consider Seymour of New York safe enough.\r\nThey turn now to a certain Seymour in Connecticut. It seems that the\r\nConnecticut Seymour still more hates human rights, self-government,\r\nlight and progress, and is a still more ardent lickspittle of\r\nslavocracy, of barbarism, and of the slave-driving whip.\r\n\r\n_July 18._--Splendid Chase urged Wadsworth to go to Florida and\r\norganize that country--very likely to prepare votes for Chase's\r\npresidency. It is not such high-toned men as Wadsworth who become\r\ntools of schemers.\r\n\r\nAgain rumors say that Stanton joined the scheme of Lincoln's\r\nre-election. As far as I can judge, Stanton's cardinal aim is to\r\ncrush the rebellion.\r\n\r\n_July 18._--The greatest glory for Wadsworth is that the majority\r\nagainst him in the last November elections is now murdering and\r\n_arsoning_ New York. All of them are unterrified, hard shell\r\ndemocrats, and cheer McClellan. These murderers are the \"friends\" of\r\nSeymour--they are the pets of that _World_, itself below the offal\r\nof hell--they are the \"gentlemen\" incendiaries of H. E. the\r\nArchbishop Hughes. On your head, most eminent Archbishop, is the\r\nwhole responsibility. These \"gentlemen\" are brought up,\r\nChristianized and moralized under your care and direction, and under\r\nthat of your tonsured crew. The \"gentlemen\" murderers are your herd,\r\nO most eminent shepherd! You ought to have and you could have\r\nstopped the rioters. And now your _stola_ is a halter and your\r\n_pallium_ gored with blood, otherwise innocent as is the blood of\r\nthe lamb incensed on the altar of Saint Agnes in Rome.\r\n\r\nMr. Seward strongly opposed the appointment of General Butler to New\r\nYork. Mr. Seward wished no harm to the \"gentlemen\" of his dear\r\nfriend the Most Eminent Archbishop, and to the select ones who\r\nhelped him to defeat Wadsworth.\r\n\r\n_July 19._--Difficult will be the task of the historian of these\r\nepisodes of riots, as well as of the whole civil war. If gifted with\r\nthe sacred spark, the future historian must carefully disentangle\r\nthe various agencies and forces in this convulsion. Some such\r\nagencies are--\r\n\r\n_a_ The righteousness of the cause of the North, defending\r\ncivilization, justice, humanity.\r\n\r\n_b_ The devotion, the self-sacrifice of the people.\r\n\r\n_c_ The littleness, helplessness, selfishness, cunning,\r\nheartlessness, empty-headedness, narrow-mindedness of the various\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\n_d_ The plague of politicians.\r\n\r\n_e_ The untiring efforts of the heathen, that is, of the Northern\r\nworshippers of the slavocrat and of his whip, efforts to uphold and\r\nsave their idol.\r\n\r\n_f_ The fatal influence of the press. The republican or patriot\r\npress neither sufficiently vigilant, nor clear-sighted, nor\r\nintelligent, nor undaunted; not reinvigorated by new, young\r\nagencies; the bad press reckless, unprincipled, without honor and\r\nconscience, but bold, ferocious in its lies, and sacrificing all\r\nthat is noble, human and pure to the idol of slavery.\r\n\r\n_July 19._--The more details about the shame of Hagerstown and of\r\nWilliamsport, the more it rends heart and mind. I saw many soldiers\r\nand officers, sick, wounded and healthy. Their accounts agree, and\r\ncut to the quick. Our army was flushed with victory, craving for\r\nfight, and in a state of enthusiastic exaltation. But our generals\r\nwere not therein in communion with the officers, with the rank and\r\nfile. Enthusiasm! this highest and most powerful element to secure\r\nvictory, and on which rely all the true captains; enthusiasm, that\r\nmade invincible the phalanx of Alexander; invincible Cæsar's legions\r\nand Napoleon's columns; enthusiasm was of no account for the\r\ngenerals in council. O _Meade_! better were it for you if your\r\ncouncil was held among, or with the soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe Rebel army was demoralized, as a retreating army always is; no\r\ndoubt exists concerning a partial, at least, disorganization of the\r\nrebels. But Lee and his generals understood how to make a bold show,\r\nand a bold, menacing front, with what was not yet disorganized, and\r\nour generals caved in, in the council.\r\n\r\nThis July 19th is heavy, dark and gloomy.... I wish it were all\r\nover.\r\n\r\n_July 19._--Thurlow Weed puffs Stanton and patronises him. O, God!\r\nIt is a terrible blow to Stanton. How, now, can one have confidence\r\nin Stanton's manhood. Are contracts at the bottom of the puff, or is\r\nit only one of _Weed's_ tricks to defile and to ruin _Stanton_?\r\n\r\n_July 20._--It is almost humiliating to witness how mongrels and\r\npigmies attempt to rob the people of their due glory, how they\r\nattempt to absorb to their own credit what the pitiless pressure of\r\nevents forced upon them. All of them limped after events as lame\r\nducks in mud; not one foresaw any thing, not one understood the\r\n_to-day_. Neither emancipation nor the transformation of slave into\r\nfree states, are of your special, individual work, O, great men; but\r\nyou strut now.\r\n\r\n  _Mirmidons, race féconde, enfin nous commandons._\r\n\r\nSome say that the generals who let Lee off, intended not to\r\nhumiliate their former chief and pet McClellan.\r\n\r\n_July 20._--Cavalry wanted. Stables and corrals filled with horses,\r\nbut no saddles. No saddles in this most industrious country! No\r\nbrains in the Quartermasters or in those to whom it belongs. And\r\nperhaps no will, and perhaps no honesty. No saddles! Oh! I am sure\r\nit is nobody's fault; no workmen are to be found, and no leather,\r\nand no men to look after the country's good. That is the rub.\r\n\r\n_July 20._--Captain Collins, commanding a United States man-of-war,\r\ncaptures an English blockade-runner near an isolated shoal somewhere\r\nin the vicinity of Bermuda. England asserts that the shoal is a\r\nshore, and that the maritime league is violated. Mr. Seward at once\r\nyields, Neptune defends as he always does, the rights of the\r\nnational _Tritons_, and of the national flag. The supreme power\r\nsides with Seward, and an order is given to reprimand Collins or\r\nsomething like it: it is done, and the prize-court decides that\r\nCaptain Collins has made a lawful capture. I hope Collins will be\r\nconsoled, and light his segar with the reprimand.\r\n\r\nThe future historian will duly ponder and establish Mr. Seward's\r\nclaims to the _salvage_ of the country.\r\n\r\n_July 20._--From all that I learn, _Meade_ has a better and larger\r\narmy than Lee; oh, may only Meade establish that he has the biggest\r\nbrains of the two.\r\n\r\n_July 20._--From time to time, I read the various statutes issued by\r\nthe last Congress, and am strengthened in my opinion that Congress\r\nserved the people well. The various statutes are the triumph of\r\nlegislation. They are clear, precise, well-worded results of\r\npatriotic, devoted, far-seeing and undaunted minds and brains. All\r\nglory to the majority of the Thirty-seventh Congress!\r\n\r\n_July 21._--A manly and patriotic letter from James T. Brady is\r\npublished in the papers. Such Democrats, Irishmen and lawyers, like\r\nBrady, honor the party, the nationality, and the profession.\r\n\r\n_July 21._--A mystery surrounds the appointment of _Grant_ to the\r\ncommand of the fated Potomac army. _Yes_ and _no_ say the helmsmen.\r\nThe truth seems to be, it was offered to Grant, and he respectfully\r\nrefused to accept it. If so, it is an evidence in favor of Grant. To\r\ngive up glory and devoted companions in arms, to give all this up\r\nfor the sake of running into the unknown, and into the jaws of the\r\nstill breathing McClellanism, and into the vicinity of the central\r\ntelegraphic station! Grant believes in volunteers; and for this\r\nreason it is to be regretted that he refused to correct the West\r\nPoint notions.\r\n\r\n_July 21._--The draft occasions much bad blood, and evokes violent\r\ndissatisfaction. The draft is a dire necessity; but it could have\r\nbeen avoided if time, men, and the people's enthusiasm had not been\r\nso sacrilegiously wasted. The three hundred dollar clause is not a\r\nhappy invention, and its omission would have given a better\r\ncharacter to that law.\r\n\r\n_July 21._--If the New York traitors succeed in preventing the\r\ndraft, then they will riot against taxes; after breaking down the\r\ntaxes, they will riot against the greenbacks, against the\r\nemancipation, and finally force the reconstruction of the Union with\r\nthe murderous rebel chiefs in the senatorial chairs, according to\r\nthe Seward-Mercier-Richmond programme. Any one can see in the\r\nCain-Copperhead newspapers of New York, of Boston, of Philadelphia,\r\nand in the letters and speeches of those matricides, what are their\r\naims, and how their plans are laid out.\r\n\r\n_July 21._--Again I am most positively assured that some time ago a\r\nfriendly offensive and defensive alliance was concluded between W.\r\nH. Seward and Edwin Stanton. The high powers were represented by\r\nThurlow Weed and Morgan for Seward, and the virtuous, lachrymose,\r\nwhite-cravated Whiting acted for Stanton. I was told that this\r\nalliance drove Watson, (Assistant Secretary,) from the War Department.\r\nThis would be infernal, if true. I know that no _Weed_ whatever could\r\napproach such a man as Watson; but Watson assured me that he returns\r\nback, and I cannot believe that Stanton could consent to be thus sold.\r\n\r\n_July 22._--Honorable, virtuous, tear-shedding, jockey-dressing\r\nWhiting wanted to make a trip to Europe. Sharp and acute, the great\r\nexpounder found out at once that Mr. Seward is one of the greatest\r\nand noblest patriots of all times. Reward followed. Whiting goes to\r\nEurope on a special mission--to dine, if he is invited, with all the\r\ngreat and small men to whom Mr. Adams or Mr. Dayton may introduce\r\nhim, and to convince everybody in Europe that the Sewards, the\r\nWhitings, &c., are the _crème de la crème_ of the American people.\r\n_Vive la bagatelle._\r\n\r\n_July 22._--How putrescent is all around! But it is not the nation,\r\nnot the people. And as the sun raises above the darkest and heaviest\r\nvapors, so in America the spirit of mankind, incarnated in and\r\nanimating the people, towers above the filth of politicians, of\r\ncabinet-makers, of presidential-peddlers, etc. Look to the masses to\r\nfind consolation. How splendidly acts Massachusetts and New\r\nEngland's sons! And what free State is not New England's son? The\r\nyouth of Massachusetts are almost all in the field--the rich and the\r\npoor, those of the best social standing, and of the genuine good\r\nblood and standing; scholars and mechanics, all of them shouldered\r\nthe musket.\r\n\r\n_July 23._--How strangely and how slowly Meade manoeuvres! It looks\r\nMcClellan-like. O, God of battles, warm and inspire Meade!\r\n\r\n_July 23._--Only boys in the corps of invalids. It has its good. For\r\nscores of years to come, these invalids will be the living legend of\r\nthis treasonable, matricidal rebellion, and of the atrocious\r\nmisconduct of our helmsmen. I hope that when returned home, these\r\ninvalids will be as many extirpators of all kinds of _Weeds_ in\r\ntheir respective townships and villages. They will become the lights\r\nof the new era.\r\n\r\n_July 23._--Were it not for the murdered, these New York riots could\r\nbe considered welcome. The rioting cannibals, and their prompters\r\nand defenders showed their hands. No one in his senses can now doubt\r\nhow heartily and devotedly Jeff Davis was served by his hirelings\r\namong the Copperhead leaders and among the New York Copperhead\r\npress. The cannibals cheered for McClellan, and the Administration\r\nhas neither enough courage nor self respect to put that fetish on\r\nthe retired list.\r\n\r\nIn the old, flourishing times of Romanism and papacy, such a Most\r\nEminent Hughes would long ago have been suspended by the Holy See.\r\nThe Most Eminent's standing among the continental European\r\nEpiscopacy is not eminent at all, whatever be Mr. Seward's opinion.\r\nThe Most Eminent is a curious observer of the canons, of the papal\r\nbulls, and of other clerical and episcopal paraphernalia. The spirit\r\nanimating the Most Eminent is not the spirit of the Roman Sapienzia.\r\nI well recollect what I heard lectured in that Roman papal\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\n_July 24._--As a dark and ominous cloud, Lee with his army hovers\r\naround Washington, keeps the Shenandoah valley, and may again cross\r\nover to the Cumberland valley. It seems that the generals whose\r\ncouncil-of-war allowed Lee to recross the river unhurt, believed\r\nthat Lee with all speed would run to Richmond; and now they hang to\r\nhis brow and eye.\r\n\r\nThe crime of Williamsport bears fruit. Never, never in this or in\r\nthe other life, can the perpetrators of the Williamsport crime atone\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nIt may come that the western armies and generals will bring the\r\ncivil war to an end, the Potomac army all the time marching and\r\ncountermarching between the Potomac and the Rappahannock. And such a\r\nsplendid army, such heroic soldiers and officers, to be sacrificed\r\nto the ignorant stubbornness of sham military science!\r\n\r\n_July 25._--I positively learn that Gilmore has scarcely ten\r\nthousand men, infantry, and is to storm the various forts and\r\ndefenses around the Charleston harbor. If Gilmore succeeds, then it\r\nis a wonder. But in sound valuation, Gilmore has not men enough to\r\norganize columns of attack so that the one shall follow the other\r\nwithin a short, very short supporting distance. And the losses will\r\nalmost hourly reduce Gilmore's small force. I dread repulse and\r\nheavy losses. Some one at the head-quarters deserves to be quartered\r\nfor such a distribution of troops. With the immense resources and\r\nmeans of transportation, it is so easy to send twenty thousand\r\ntroops to Gilmore, attack, make short work of it, and then carry the\r\ntroops back to where they belonged. But to concentrate and act in\r\nmasses is not the _credo_ of the--not yet quartered--head-quarters.\r\n\r\n_July 26._--Old--but not slow--Welles again gives to Seward a lesson\r\nof good-behavior, of sound sense, and of mastery of international\r\nlaws. The prize courts side with Welles. Because Neptune has a white\r\nwig and beard, he is considered slow, when in reality he is active,\r\nunflinching, and progressive.\r\n\r\n_July 26._--O, could I only exclaim, _Exegi monumentum aere\r\nperennius_, to the noble, the patriotic, and the good, as well as to\r\nthe helpless, the selfish, and the counterfeits.\r\n\r\n_July 27._--_Philadelphia._ Flags in all the streets, volunteers\r\nparading and drilling. Prosperity, activity and devotion permeate\r\nthe country. So at least I am led to believe. All this is so\r\nrefreshing, after witnessing in Washington such strenuous efforts\r\nhow not to do it.\r\n\r\nBad news. I learn that Gilmore is repulsed. When the _forlorn hope_\r\nentered Fort Wagner, no support promptly came, and the heroes, black\r\nand white, were massacred or expelled. Gilmore ought to have been\r\nmore cautious, and not to have undertaken an operation which was on\r\nits outside stamped with impossibility. Perhaps Gilmore obeyed\r\nperemptory orders. Who gave them?\r\n\r\nLee's army escapes through Chester Gap, and thus we have not cut the\r\nrebels from Richmond, and now they are ahead of us. Again\r\nout-manoeuvred! and _nobody's fault_, only the campaign prolonged\r\n_ad infinitum_. Perhaps it is in the programme!\r\n\r\n_July 28._--_Philadelphia._ The petty, narrow, school conceit\r\nimbibed in the West Point nursery, is the stumbling-block barring\r\neverywhere the expansion of a healthy and vigorous activity. I\r\nlistened to the heaviest absurdities and fogyism on military affairs\r\n_oracularly_ preached by one of the great West Pointers on duty\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n_July 31._--_Long Branch._ Away from personal contact, even from the\r\nview of politicians, of plotters, of lickspittles. How refreshing,\r\nhow invigorating, how soothing!\r\n\r\nMr. Seward, with a due tail, visits Fortress Monroe. What for?\r\nIs it to organize some underground road to reunion on the\r\nMercier-Seward-Richmond programme?\r\n\r\nOne well-informed writes me that the last programme of Lincoln,\r\nHalleck and Meade is, that the army of the Potomac is to keep Lee at\r\nbay, but not to attack. If true, how well designed to give time to\r\nLee to do what he likes, to reorganize, to send away his troops\r\nwhere he may please, to call them back--in one word to be fully at\r\nhis ease on our account. Will this country ever escape the tutorship\r\nof sham science?\r\n\r\n_July 31._--_Long Branch._ Seward's concession policy towards France\r\nbears fruit in Mexico. Of course the _Decembriseur_ outwitted the\r\nWeed-Albany-Auburn politician statesman. But it is not the ignorant\r\nforeign policy which strengthened and strengthens the French policy\r\nin Mexico. It is the blunders, the tergiversations, the gropings,\r\nand the crimes of our internal domestic policy, which, protracting\r\nthe war, allows the French conspirator to murder the Mexicans.\r\n\r\n_July 31. L. B._--So the _Decembriseur_ amuses himself in creating\r\nan Imperial throne in Mexico for some European princely idiot or\r\nintriguer. All right. I have confidence in the Mexicans. The future\r\nEmperor, even if established for some time on the cushion of treason\r\npropped by French bayonets, that manikin before short or long will\r\nbe _Iturbidised_. Further: I have confidence in the French people.\r\nThe upper crust is pestilential. Bonapartists, lickspittles, lackeys\r\nand incarnations of all imaginary corruptions compose that upper\r\ncrust. But I would bet a fortune, had I one, that in the course of\r\nthe next five years, the _Decembriseur_ and his _Prince Imperial_\r\nwill be visible at Barnum's, and that some shoddy grandee from 5th\r\nAvenue, will issue cards inviting _to meet the Empress Eugénie_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUST, 1863.\r\n\r\n     Stanton -- Twenty Thousand -- Canadians -- Peterhoff -- Coffey --\r\n     Initiation -- Electioneering -- Reports -- Grant -- McClellan --\r\n     Belligerent Rights -- Menagerie -- Watson -- Jury -- Democrats --\r\n     Bristles -- \"Where is Stanton?\" -- \"Fight the monster\" --\r\n     Chasiana -- Luminaries -- Ballistic -- Political Economy, etc.,\r\n     etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 2. Long Branch._--The organs of all shades and of all\r\ngradations of ill-wishers to the cause of the North, and to that of\r\nEmancipation, the secret friends of Jeff Davis, and the open\r\nsupporters of McClellan are untiring in their open, slanderous,\r\ntreacherous accusations of _Stanton_; others spread sanctimoniously\r\nperfidious suggestions against the Secretary of War, and so does the\r\n_National Intelligencer_, this foremost Whig-Conservative, double or\r\ntreble-faced organ. _Stanton_ is called to account for all mishaps,\r\nmismanagement, disasters and disgraces which befall our armies\r\nbetween the Rio Grande and the Potomac. Such accusations, to a\r\ncertain degree, could be justified if the Secretary of War were\r\nclothed with the same powers, and therefore with the same\r\nresponsibilities as is the case in European governments.\r\n\r\nBut every one knows that here the war machinery is very complicated,\r\nbecause wheels turn within wheels. The Secretary of War is not alone\r\nto answer and he is not exclusively responsible for the appointment\r\nof good, middling, or wholly bad generals and commanders. Every one\r\nknows it. _Stanton_ may have all the possible shortcomings and\r\nfaults with which his enemies so richly clothe him; one thing is\r\ncertain, that _Stanton_ advocated and always advocates fighting, and\r\nStanton furnishes the generals and commanders with all means and\r\nresources at the country's and the department's disposition. If many\r\nrespectable men are to be trusted, _Stanton_ never interferes with\r\nintrinsic military operations, never orders or insinuates, or\r\ndictates to the commanders of our armies where and in what way they\r\nare to get at the enemy and to fight him. As far as I know Stanton\r\nkeeps aloof from strategy.\r\n\r\nStanton _is insincere and untruthful_, say his enemies. Granted. I\r\nnever found a man in power to be otherwise in personal questions or\r\nrelations. It is almost impossible for the power-holders to be\r\nsincere and truthful.\r\n\r\n  Trust in thy sword,\r\n  Rather than prince's (president's) word;\r\n  Trust in fortuna's sinister,\r\n  Rather than prince's minister.\r\n\r\nBut _Stanton_ is truthful and sincere to the cause, and that is all\r\nthat I want from him. Stanton's alleged _malice_ against McClellan\r\nhad the noblest and the most patriotic sources, which, of course,\r\ncould not be understood or appreciated by Stanton's revilers.\r\n\r\nThe organs of treason and of infamy refer always to McClellan. _O\r\nrace, knitted of the devils excrements mixed with his saliva_, [see\r\nTalleyrand about Thiers] your treason is only equal to your\r\nimpudence and ignorance. If in February, 1862, Stanton had not urged\r\nMcClellan to move, probably the Potomac Army would have spent all\r\nthe year in its tents before Washington. McClellan's henchmen and\r\nminions thrusted and still thrust the grossest lies down the throat\r\nof a certain public, eager to gulp slander as sugar plums.\r\nMcClellan's stupidity at Yorktown and in the Chickahominy is\r\nvindicated by his crew with the following counter accusation: that\r\nall disasters have been generated because McDowell with his twenty\r\nthousand men did not join McClellan. If McClellan had in him the\r\nsoldiership of a non-commissioned officer, on his knees he ought to\r\nimplore his crew not to expose him in this way. When a general has\r\nin hand about one hundred and ten thousand men, as McClellan had on\r\nentering the peninsula, and accomplishes nothing, then it is a proof\r\nthat he, the general, is wholly unable and ignorant how to handle\r\nlarge masses. If McClellan could not manage one hundred thousand\r\nmen, still less would he have been able to manage the twenty\r\nthousand more of McDowell's corps.\r\n\r\nThe stupidity of attempting to invest Richmond is beyond words, and\r\nfor such an operation several hundred thousand men would have been\r\nnecessary. [Spoke of it in Vol. I.] If twenty thousand men arrive\r\nnot at a certain day or hour when a battle is raging, most surely\r\nthis failure may occasion a defeat--Grouchy at Waterloo--but in\r\nMcClellan's Chickahominy operations, twenty thousand men more would\r\nhave served only still more plainly to expose his incapacity, and to\r\nbe a prey to fevers and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the rebel army in Richmond was always less numerous than\r\nMcClellan's; the rebels always understood to have more troops than\r\nhad McClellan when they attacked him. During that whole cursed and\r\nignominious (for McClellan) Chickahominy campaign, McClellan never\r\nfought at once more of his men than about thirty thousand. It was\r\nnot the absence of twenty thousand men that prevented a commander\r\nof one hundred thousand from engaging more of his troops, and for\r\nquickly supporting such corps as were attacked by the enemy.\r\n\r\n_August 3: L. B._--The Colonists, that is, the appendixes of\r\nEngland, as the Canadians, the Nova Scotians, and of any other\r\ncolonial dignity and name, together with their great statesmen,\r\ncertain Howes and Johnsons, etc. etc. etc. agitate; they are in\r\ntrances like little fish out of water. They find it so pleasant to\r\nseize an occasion to look like something great. Poor frogs! trying\r\nto blow themselves into leviathans. Their whelpish snarling at the\r\nNorth reminds one of little curs snarling at a mastiff. How can\r\nthese colonists imagine that a royal prince of England could reside\r\namong something which is as indefinite as are colonists--something\r\nneither fish nor flesh.\r\n\r\n_August 3._--The _Evening Post_ contains a letter on the difference\r\nbetween the behavior of Union men in Missouri during the treasonable\r\nriots in St. Louis in the Spring of 1861, and the conduct of the\r\nUnion men in New York during the recent riots. But the Saint Louis\r\npatriot is silent--has forgotten the immortal Lyons who saved that\r\ncity and its patriots, who saved Missouri. (General Scott insisted\r\nupon courtmartialing Lyons.)\r\n\r\nAlso, have you already forgotten the foremost among heroes and\r\npatriots, and whose loss is more telling now than it was in 1861.\r\nForgotten one of the purest and noblest victims of Washington\r\nblindness, of General Scott's unmilitary policy and conduct.\r\nForgotten the true son of the people? But O Lyons! thy name will be\r\nvenerated by coming generations.\r\n\r\n_August 4: L. B._--_The Cliques._\r\n\r\n_a_ The worst, and the womb of all evils is the Weed-Seward clique.\r\nAround it group contractors, jobbers, shoddy, and all kinds of other\r\nsocial impurities.\r\n\r\n_b_ The ambitious, intriguing, selfish, narrow-minded West Point\r\nclique.\r\n\r\n_c_ The not brave, not patriotic, and freedom-hating, unintelligent\r\nMcClellan clique.\r\n\r\n_d_ Copperheads of various hues and gradations.\r\n\r\nCliques _a_, _b_, and _c_, generated and fostered Copperheads, and\r\nfacilitated their expansion.\r\n\r\n_e_ Imbeciles, lickspittles, politicians, etc.\r\n\r\n_f_ The Lincolnites, closely intertwined with the _genus e_; the\r\nBlair men, etc.\r\n\r\n_g_ The partisans of Chase. This clique is the most variously and\r\nmost curiously composed. Honest imbeciles, makers of phrases,\r\nrhetors, heavy and narrow-minded, office-hunters, office expectants,\r\npoliticians, contractors, admirers of pompousness and of would-be\r\nradicalism, all who turn round and round, and see not beyond their\r\nnoses, etc.\r\n\r\nSeveral minor cliques exist, but deserve not to be mentioned. Behind\r\nthese mud-hills rises the true people, as the Himalayas rise above\r\nthe plains of Asia.\r\n\r\n_August 4._--Why could not Everett, that good and true patriot,\r\npreside over our relations with Europe; or why is that thorough\r\nAmerican statesman, Governor Marcy, dead! How different, how\r\nrespected, how truly American would have been the character of our\r\nrelations with Europe! No prophecies, no lies would have been told,\r\nno gross ignorance displayed!\r\n\r\n_August 4. L. B._--In the columns of the _Times_ a friend of Halleck\r\ntries to make a great man of the General-in-chief. Halleck\r\nrepudiates Burnside and Hooker, but claims the victory at\r\nGettysburgh, because Meade, being a good disciplinarian, executed\r\nHalleck's orders. So from his room in G street Washington, Halleck\r\ndirected the repulse of the furiously attacking columns. Bravo! more\r\nbravo as no telegraph connects Washington with Gettysburgh!\r\n\r\nMeade being a good disciplinarian, the crime of Williamsport falls\r\nupon Halleck; the commander-in-chief is the more responsible, as the\r\ncrime was perpetrated under his nose; about four hours' drive could\r\nhave brought him to our army, and then Halleck in person could have\r\ndirected the attack upon the enemy.\r\n\r\nFrom all that transpires about Williamsport one must conclude that\r\nLee must have known that he would not be seriously attacked, and\r\nthat he was not much afraid of the combined disciplinarian\r\ngeneralship.\r\n\r\nFurther: Halleck claims for himself Grant's success, because Grant\r\nobeyed orders, and Rosecrans did the same. How astonishing,\r\ntherefore, that their campaigns ended in victories and not in such\r\nshame as Halleck at Corinth, in 1862. Rosecrans was inspired by\r\ntelegraph to change defeat into victory; the indomitable Grant\r\nreceived by telegraph the fertility of resources shown by him at\r\nVicksburgh. Oh! Halleck! you cannot succeed in thus belittling the\r\ntwo heroes, and you may tell your little story to the marines.\r\n\r\n_August 4._--The Proclamation on retaliation is a well-written\r\ndocument; but like all Mr. Lincoln's acts it is done almost too\r\nlate, only when the poor President was so cornered by events, that\r\nshifting and escape became impossible. If I am well informed Stanton\r\nlong ago demanded such a Proclamation, but Lincoln's familiar demons\r\nprevented it. Nevertheless Lincoln will be credited for what\r\nintrinsically is not his.\r\n\r\n_August 5: L. B._--Thomas--not Paul--Lincoln's pet, returns to the\r\nMississippi to organise Africo-American regiments. For six months\r\nthey organize, organize and have not yet fifteen thousand in field.\r\nIf Stanton had been left alone, we would have to-day in battle order\r\nat least fifty thousand Africo-Americans.\r\n\r\n_August 5: L. B._--All computed together, among all Western\r\nContinental European nations, the Germans, both here and in Germany,\r\nbehave the best towards the North. I mean the genuine German people.\r\nThinkers and rationalists are seldom, if ever, found on the wrong\r\nside. I rejoice to see the Germans behave so nobly.\r\n\r\n_August 5._--The Peterhoff condemned, notwithstanding all the\r\nefforts to the contrary of our brilliant, versatile and highly\r\nerudite in international laws Secretary of state. But Mr. Seward\r\nwill not understand the lesson. How could he?\r\n\r\n_August 5: L. B._--At least for the fiftieth time, Seward insinuates\r\nto the public that we are on the eve of a breach with England--but\r\nSeward will prevent it. Oh, Oh! Yes, O Seward! when backed by the\r\niron clads and by twenty-two millions of a brave and stubborn\r\npeople!\r\n\r\n_August 5: L. B._--Poor Stanton, I pity him! After Weed comes the\r\n\"little villain,\" with his puffs. Happily, the _World_ abuses\r\nStanton, and this alone makes up even for the applause of Weed and\r\nhis consorts.\r\n\r\n_August 7: L. B._--COFFEY, Assistant Attorney-General, published a\r\nlegal, official opinion on maritime, commercial _copperheadism_;\r\nthat is, when an American vessel, from an American port, is sent in\r\nballast to a neutral port to load there, afterwards to run the\r\nblockade, Coffey proves it to be treason and criminality. The\r\ndocument is clear, logical, precise and not wordy: not in the style\r\nof the State Department logomachy. Why, O why cannot such younger\r\nmen be at the head! Emancipation would have been carried out,\r\nslavery destroyed, the Union restored, rebels crushed, and the\r\nFrench murderers and imperial lackeys would cut very respectful\r\ncapers to please a great people.\r\n\r\n_August 8: L. B._--I shudder as I pass in review what little is done\r\nat such an enormous expenditure of human limbs and of human life,\r\nnot to speak of squandered time, labor and money.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the prevailing rule is to reach the smallest results\r\nat the greatest possible cost. General Scott, Seward and Lincoln\r\nearly laid down that rule. McClellan, that quintessence of all\r\nunsoldierlike capacities, faithfully continued what was already\r\ninaugurated. Halleck almost perfected it; and so it became a chronic\r\ndisease of the leading spirits in the Administration, Stanton and\r\nWelles excepted. That sacrilegious, murderous method and rule, at\r\ntimes was forcibly violated by Grant, by Rosecrans, by Banks, by the\r\nglorious Farragut, by Admiral Porter. The would-be statesmen either\r\nsee nothing or do not wish to see what ill-disposed minds could\r\nconsider to be an almost premeditated slaughter.\r\n\r\nI know too well that every initiation is with sacrifice or blood. It\r\nis a law of progress, absolute, not made by man, but cut out for him\r\nby fate or providence. In a stream of his mother's life-blood man\r\nenters this world; by the blood of the Redeemer the Christian\r\nbecomes initiated to another, called a better world. Sacrifice and\r\nblood prevail throughout the eons of the initiation of human\r\nsocieties and religions. Through sacrifice and blood the Reformation\r\nbecame a redeemer. Great results are reached at great cost. I am an\r\natom in a generation which, to assert her deep, earnest\r\nconvictions, never caved in before blood and sacrifice; a generation\r\nthat has labored and still labors, spreads seed and begins to\r\nharvest; a generation which regrets nothing, and cheerfully takes\r\nthe responsibility of its actions. And with all this, the men of\r\nconvictions and of undaunted revolutionary courage in Europe,\r\nbestowed and bestow more care upon any unnecessary sacrifice of\r\nhuman life than I witness here. By heavens! Marat, Saint Just,\r\nRobespierre, could be considered lambs when compared with the\r\n_faiseurs_ here. And Marat, Saint Just, and Robespierre were\r\nfanatics of ideas: here they are _fanaticised_ by selfishness,\r\nintrigue, helplessness and imbecility.\r\n\r\n_August 9: L. B._--For the last few months men of sound and\r\ndispassionate judgment tried to convince me that there is somewhere,\r\nin high regions, a settled purpose to prolong the war until the next\r\npresidential election. I always disbelieved such assertions; but\r\nnow, considering all this criminal sluggishness, I begin to believe\r\nin the existence of such a criminal purpose.\r\n\r\n_August 9: L. B._--All the open and secret Copperhead organs raise a\r\nshrill cry on account of what they pervert into McClellan's general\r\nReport of his unmilitary campaigns. When a commander is in the\r\nfield, he is in duty bound, as soon as possible, that is, in the\r\nnext few weeks, to send to his superior or to the Government, a\r\nReport of each of his military movements and operations. McClellan\r\nought to have immediately made a Report to the Government after his\r\n_bloodless victory_ at Centreville and Manassas; a victory crowned\r\nwith maple trophies! Then McClellan ought to have sent another\r\nReport after the great success at Yorktown, and so on. Every period\r\nof his campaign ought to have been separately reported. It is done\r\nin all well organized governments and armies, and it is the duty of\r\nthe staff of the army to prepare such periodical, successive\r\nReports. Even if the sovereign himself takes the field, the staff of\r\nthe army sends such Reports to the Secretary of War. Nobody stood in\r\nthe way of McClellan's doing what it was his imperative duty to do,\r\nand to do immediately.\r\n\r\nBut it is unheard of that a commander during a year at the head of\r\nan army, should take another year to prepare his Report. No\r\nself-respecting government would allow such an insubordination, or\r\naccept such a tardy Report. If a government should act upon such a\r\nReport, it would be rather by dismissing from service, etc., the\r\nsluggish--if not worse--commander.\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"McClellan's Report,\" concocted by a board of choice\r\nCopperheads in New York, and of which the _World's_ hireling was an\r\namanuensis, that production is certainly an elaborate essay on\r\nMcClellan's campaigns, is certainly bristling with afterthoughts and\r\n_post facta_, as pedestals for the fetish's altar. It must have on\r\nits face the mark of combination, but not of truth. Such a\r\nReport--not written on the spot, in the atmosphere of activity, not\r\nwritten by officers of the staff, not by the Chief-of-staff--such a\r\nReport cannot command or inspire any confidence; it has not, and\r\nought not to have any worth in the Government's archives. McClellan\r\nmay publish his memoirs, or essays, or anything else, and therein\r\nmay shine this labor of a _dasippus_ assisted by vipers.\r\n\r\n_August 11: L. B._--In Washington they seem to insist that Grant\r\nshall take the command of the Potomac Army. If Grant accepts, he\r\nwill be a ruined man. Grant ought to have Pope in memory. Grant soon\r\nwill see stained his glorious and matchless military record. He will\r\nnot withstand the cliques and the underground intrigues of craving,\r\nselfish and unsatisfied ambitions.\r\n\r\nIf Halleck could only know what in a European army any tyro knows,\r\nHalleck would make Mr. Lincoln understand that such an appointment\r\nmust produce confusion, as no regular staffs exist in our army. (I\r\nspoke somewhere about it.)\r\n\r\n_August 13: L. B._--Can it be possible that several from among the\r\nRepublicans, honest leaders, gravitate towards Lincoln, and already\r\nbegin to agitate for Lincoln's re-election? If it is so--if the\r\npeople submit to such an imposition--O, then, genius of history, go\r\nin mourning!\r\n\r\n_August 13: L. B._--The Board appointed by Stanton to investigate\r\ninto the condition of the Africo-Americans, has published its\r\ndissertation--very poor--in the shape of a Report. Stanton intended\r\nto do a good thing by appointing that Board. It did not turn out so\r\nwell as Stanton expected. What is the use of expatiating--as do the\r\nthree wise men in their Report--on certain psychological qualities\r\nand _non-qualities_ of the Africo-American? The paramount question\r\nis how to organize the emancipated in their condition of freedom.\r\nWhen Stanton appointed that Board he wished to have elucidated, if\r\nnot settled, the way and manner in which to deal with the new\r\ncitizens or semi-citizens; but Stanton was the last man to look for\r\nan old psychological re-hash, without any social or moral\r\nsignification whatever; a re-hash whose axioms and apothegms are, at\r\nleast, a quarter of a century _behind_ the scientific elucidations\r\non races, on Africans, even on Anglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\n_August 15: L. B._--Weeks ago Grant sent his Report, embracing the\r\nvarious operations connected with the fall of Vicksburgh. Grant did\r\nnot want a year to make a school-boy like composition, as did\r\nMcClellan with his quill-holders. Every word of Grant's Report\r\nresounds with military spirit and simplicity. Grant has not to put\r\ntruth on the rack and throw dust into people's eyes. Three cheers\r\nfor McClellan! Grant has confidence in the volunteers; not so\r\nMcClellan, who had only confidence in shams. Grant and his army, at\r\nthe best, were the second sons of the Administration--not of the\r\npeople; to the last day McClellan was the pet, the spoiled child,\r\nand as such he disgraced his parents, tutors, etc., and ruined his\r\nparent's house.\r\n\r\n_August 15._--A letter published by the Honorable W. Whiting, (who\r\nis now traveling,) occasions much noise. The letter is pointed and\r\nkeen, but the writer knows mighty little about international laws.\r\nAlmost _a priori_ he recognizes in the rebels, as he says, \"only the\r\nrights of belligerents.\" Only the rights of belligerents! Such\r\nrights are very ample, and for this reason they belong in their\r\nplenitude exclusively to absolutely independent nations. To\r\nrecognize _a priori_ such rights in the rebels, is equivalent to\r\nrecognizing them as an independent nation. In pure and absolute\r\nprinciple of modern (not Roman) _jus gentium_, rebels have not only\r\nno belligerent rights, but not any rights at all. Rebels are _ipso\r\nfacto_ outlaws in full. Writers like Abbe Galiano, Vatel, etc., for\r\nthe sake of humanity and expediency, recommend to the lawful\r\nsovereign to use mercy, to treat rebels _in parte_ as belligerents,\r\nand not as _a priori_ condemned criminals.\r\n\r\n_August 16: L. B._--Seward is to promenade the diplomats over the\r\ncountry. He is Barnum, the diplomats are the menagerie. Poor Lord\r\nLyons. Very probably it is Seward's last rocket to draw upon himself\r\nthe attention of the people.\r\n\r\n_August 16. L. B._--The probabilities of a rupture with France are\r\nupon the public mind. I still misbelieve it. I have not the\r\nslightest doubt that the _Decembriseur_ is full of treachery towards\r\nthe North, and that his Imperialist lackeys blow brimstone against\r\nthe Northern principles. But are the French people so debased as to\r\nsubmit? We shall see. Let that crowned conspirator begin a war of\r\ntreason against the North. Before long the French people will put an\r\nend to the war and to the Decembriseur.\r\n\r\n_August 16. L. B._--I learn that Watson has very gravely injured his\r\nhealth by labor, that is, by being the most faithful servant of the\r\ncountry and of its cause. I never, anywhere in my life, met a public\r\nofficer so undaunted at his duties, so unassuming, so quiet as\r\nWatson, in his duties of Assistant Secretary of War, which are as\r\nthorny as can be imagined. Watson was, and I hope will be for the\r\nfuture, the terror of lobbyists, of bad contractors, of jobbers--in\r\none word, the terror of all the leeches of the people's pocket. And\r\nit honors Stanton to have brought into his Department such a man as\r\nWatson. I heard and hear, and read a great many accusations against\r\nStanton; but I never found any proofs which could virtually diminish\r\nmy confidence. To use a classical, stupid, rhetorical figure:\r\nStanton is not of antique mould. And who is now? But he is a\r\nsincere, devoted and ardent patriot; he broadly comprehends the task\r\nand the duty to save the country, and he sees clearly and distinctly\r\nthe ways and means to reach the sacred aim. Stanton may have, and\r\nvery many assert that he has, numerous bristles in his character, in\r\nhis deportment. Let it be so. It is the worse for him, but not for\r\nthe cause he serves.\r\n\r\n_August 16. L. B._--Are the people again to receive a President from\r\nthe hand of intriguers, from politicians, or from honest imbeciles?\r\nIf the people will stand it, then they deserve to be kept in leading\r\nstrings by all that medley.\r\n\r\n_August 16. L. B._--Rosecrans wants mounted infantry. The men of the\r\nday, the men who understand and comprehend the exigencies, the\r\nnecessities of the war, they pierce through the rotten crust of\r\nfogyism. That is promise and hope. The great organizers of the\r\narmy--the McClellans and the Hallecks--could never have found out\r\nthat mounted infantry is necessary, and will render good service.\r\nMounted infantry was not considered a necessity in the West Point\r\nhalls, and Jomini mentions it not. How should a Halleck do so?\r\n\r\n_August 17. L. B._--A defender of slavery, a Copperhead, and a\r\ntraitor, differ so little from each other, that a microscope\r\nmagnifying ten thousand times would not disclose the difference. A\r\nproslaveryist, a Copperhead, and a traitor, are the most perfect\r\n_tres in unum_.\r\n\r\n_August 18. L. B._--General Meade is absent from the army, and\r\nHumphreys, his chief-of-staff, is temporarily in command. I notice\r\nthis fact as a proof that a more rational, intelligent comprehension\r\nprevails in the military service. A chief-of-staff is the only man\r\nto be the _locum-tenens_ of the commander. At Williamsport Humphreys\r\nvoted for fight. It would be well if Meade should not return to\r\nagain take the command.\r\n\r\n_August 18._--A patriotic gentlewoman asked me why I write a diary?\r\n\"To give conscientious evidence before the jury appointed by\r\nhistory.\"\r\n\r\n_August 20._--On the first day of the draft, I had occasion to visit\r\nNew York. All was quiet. In Broadway and around the City Hall I saw\r\nless soldiers than I expected. The people are quiet; the true\r\nconspirators are thunderstruck. Before long, the names will be known\r\nof the genuine instigators of arson and of murder in July last. The\r\ntools are in the hands of justice, but the main spirits are hidden.\r\nSmart and keen wretches as are the leading Copperheads, they\r\nsuccessfully screen their names; nevertheless before long their\r\nnames will be nailed to the gallows. The _World_--which, for weeks\r\nand weeks, so devotedly, so ardently poisoned the minds, and thus\r\nprepared the way for any riot--the _World_ was and is a tool in the\r\nhands of the hidden traitors. The _World_ is a hireling, and does\r\nthe work by order.\r\n\r\n_August 21. L. B._--The final destiny of the Potomac Army seems to\r\nbe to keep Lee at bay but not to attack him. Oh! the disgraced\r\nsoldiers and officers! Chickahominy, Antietam, Fredericksburgh,\r\nGettysburgh, are the indestructible evidences of the mettle of the\r\narmy, and of the poverty or total eclipse of generalship.\r\n\r\n_August 21._--Impressionable, excitable, wave-like agitated as are\r\nmy dear American countrymen, they altogether forget _the yesterday_,\r\nand shout the last success. Further: the people cannot see clearly\r\nthrough the stultifying or the dirty dust blown in the peoples'\r\neyes; 1st, by the politicians of all hues, from the Woods, Weeds,\r\nForneys, to the Greeleys, by the simon-pures or the lobby-impures;\r\n2d, by the press of all parties and shades of parties. The people\r\nmay again make a mistake. Is not Lincoln hailed as the new Moses? as\r\nthe man for the times, as the only one God sent to direct the\r\npeople, and to grapple with the stern, earnest emergencies and\r\nperils? Emancipation is not Lincoln's, is not Sumner's, is not\r\nanybody's personal special work. The necessities, the emergencies of\r\nthe times and of the hour did it. Their current drifted Mr. Lincoln\r\nirresistibly along, and to a shore where he must land or perish.\r\n\r\n_August 23. L. B._--From the tone of certain papers, and from\r\nprivate letters, I perceive that Weed-Seward are hard at work to\r\npacify, to reunite, to save slavery and to leave unnoticed humanity\r\nand national honor. The unterrified Democrats become Weed's allies,\r\nand the alliance is to carry Seward into the White House. _Nous\r\nverrons._\r\n\r\nChase is to overturn Seward-Weed and to secure the prize. Oh, the\r\nintriguers.\r\n\r\nOn the authority of the published \"DIARY,\" I am asked, even by\r\nletters, \"Where is Stanton?\" \"I do not know, and I do not care,\" is\r\nmy answer. I would however, like to be sure that Stanton is not in\r\nthat dirty path. I am Stanton's man, as they call it; but only as\r\nlong as I find him to be _a man_.\r\n\r\n_August 24. L. B._--The Democrats are arrogant in asserting their\r\nsuperior capacity for government, for carrying on the war, and for\r\nother great things. However, I am sure that the so-called Northern\r\nDemocrats would have managed the affairs even worse than do now\r\nthose sham representatives of the principles of the Republican\r\nparty. No faith in a fundamental human, broad principle ever\r\nactuated the hard shell Democrats. McClellan and the immense\r\nmajority of generals, have been, or are full-blooded Democrats, and\r\ntheir warlike prowess dragged the people into deep, deep mire.\r\nDemocrats have to thank God for not being in power; in this way\r\ntheir incapacity to cope with such gigantic events is not exposed.\r\nThe other fortunate occurrence for the Democrats is that the\r\npower-holders for the Republican party are--what everybody sees.\r\n\r\n_August 24. L. B._--I very strongly and urgently advised Gen.\r\nWadsworth to resign. No one in the country has fulfilled more nobly\r\nhis civic and patriotic duty. I urged upon his mind that when the\r\nwar is finished, the cause of right, of justice, the interests of a\r\ngenuine self-government will require true men to rescue the people\r\nfrom the hands of the politicians. Vainly I remonstrated. Wadsworth\r\nprefers to remain in the service, and to fight the monster.\r\n\r\n_August 24. L. B._--_Chasiana._ The New York leaders of the Chase\r\nscheme make all possible efforts and platitudes to _conciliate_ Weed\r\nand win him over. What dregs all around!\r\n\r\nThe immaculate Chase! to look for support to a Weed! To Weed-Seward,\r\nwho for twenty-five years fanned the anti-slavery flame! Seward,\r\nwhom the anti-slavery wave elevated where he is, and who now kicks\r\nand spits upon the men most ardent in the cause of emancipation! O\r\ndregs! O dregs!\r\n\r\n_August 24: L. B._--The question of confiscation drags itself slowly\r\non, and soon it may resound in the courts of the whole country. If\r\nconfiscation is ever stringently executed, it will generate\r\nlaw-suits _ad libitum_ and _ad infinitum_. From the first day when\r\nthe banner of rebellion was unfolded, _each State_ became an\r\n_outlaw_ in its relations with the Union. Such a rebel State has not\r\na legal existence, and any legal act whatever between individual\r\nmembers--or rather, politically, sovereigns in and of the\r\nState--such acts are valueless in relation to the lawful sovereign,\r\nas is the Union.\r\n\r\nThe Confiscation Act is based on a wrong principle--the right to\r\nconfiscate the whole rebel property in America. This right is\r\nderived from the public law. A conqueror of a country becomes _ipso\r\nfacto_ the proprietor of all that belonged to the conquered\r\nsovereign and what is called public property, as domains, taxes,\r\nrevenues, public institutions, etc. The rebels claim to be\r\nsovereigns--that is each freeman in each respective State is a\r\nrespective sovereign. The area of such revolted State, with all the\r\nlands, cultivated or uncultivated, with the farms, and all\r\nindustrial, mercantile or mining establishments whatever, is the\r\nproperty of the sovereign, or of the sovereigns. Property of a, or\r\nof many sovereigns, is in its whole nature a public property, and as\r\nsuch, _ipso facto_, is liable to be confiscated by the conqueror.\r\n\r\n_August 24: L. B._--The massacre at Lawrence, Kansas, must\r\nexclusively be credited to those who appointed for that region a\r\npro-slavery military commander. But the power-holders are not\r\ntroubled by more or less blood, by more or less victims of their\r\nincapacity and double-dealing!\r\n\r\n_August 25: L. B._--Any future historian must beware not to seek\r\nlight in the newspapers of this epoch. The so-called good press\r\nthrows no light on events; that press is not in the hands of\r\nstatesmen or of thinkers, or of ardent students of human events, or\r\nof men having for their aim any pursuits of science or knowledge.\r\nThe luminaries of the press are no beacons for the people during\r\nthis bloody and deadly tempest! For the sake of what is called\r\npolitical capital, the most simple fact often becomes distorted and\r\nupturned by this political, short-sighted, and selfishly envious\r\npress.\r\n\r\n_August 26: L. B._--All things considered, the inflation of the\r\ncurrency and the rise in gold has proved to be beneficial to the\r\ncountry. The agricultural interest, above all, in the West, was\r\nparticularly sustained thereby. Wheat and grain would have fallen to\r\nprices ruinous for the farmers. When the gold fell, the farmer felt\r\nit by the reduction of the price of his produce. The agriculturist,\r\nthe backbone and marrow of the country, spends less money for\r\nmanufactured products than he netted clear profits by the rise in\r\ngold. If the farmer sold now his wheat for six shillings, without\r\ninflation the price might have been four shillings, and then the\r\nfarmer would have been bankrupt, unable to pay the taxes. The\r\ninflation saved the greatest interest in the country. And thus\r\nagriculture and industry flourish, the country is not ruined, is not\r\nbankrupt, as the European wiseacres took great pleasure in\r\nforeboding that it would be. So much for _absolute_ laws of\r\npolitical economy.\r\n\r\n_August 27: L. B._--The New York Republican papers insinuate that a\r\nMr. Evarts, who was sent to Europe by Mr. Seward, has given\r\nassurances to European governments that slavery will be abolished.\r\nIf such declaration was needed, why not make it through the regular\r\nrepresentatives of the country, as are Mr. Adams and Mr. Dayton? Mr.\r\nSeward is incorrigible. I am curious to know where he learned this\r\noriginal mode of _diplomatizing_. Such unofficial, confidential,\r\nsemi-confidential agents confuse European governments. They inspire\r\nvery little, if any respect for our statesmanship, and are offensive\r\nto our regularly appointed ministers. What must the crown lawyers in\r\nEngland have thought of Mr. Evart's great mastery of international\r\nlaws?\r\n\r\n_August 30._--Our military powers in Washington, led on and inspired\r\nby Halleck, cannot put an end to guerrillas, or rather to those\r\nhighwaymen who rob, so to speak, at the military gates of\r\nWashington. Lieber-Halleck-Hitchcock's treatise frightened not the\r\nguerrillas, but most assuredly the gallows will do it. Everywhere\r\nelse the like banditti would be summarily treated; and these\r\nwould-be guerrillas here are evidences of the uttermost social\r\ndissolution. They are no soldiers, no guerrillas, and deserve no\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\n_August 31: L. B._--According to the _Tribune_, Mr. Lincoln deserves\r\nall the credit for General Gilmore's success before Charleston.\r\nThere we have it! Mr. Lincoln, outdoing Carnot for military sagacity\r\nand capacity, Mr. Lincoln approved Gilmore's plans. Mr.\r\nLincoln-Halleck aiding--at once understood the laws of ballistics,\r\nand other _et ceteras_ which underlay the plan of every siege. And\r\nnow to doubt that Lincoln, with his Halleck, are military geniuses!\r\nO _Tribune_!\r\n\r\n_August 31: L. B._--I learned that Grant most positively refused to\r\naccept the command of the Potomac Army. They cannot ruin Grant--they\r\nwill neutralize him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER, 1863.\r\n\r\n     Jeff Davis -- Incubuerunt -- O, Youth! -- Lucubrations -- Genuine\r\n     Europe -- It is forgotten -- Fremont -- Prof. Draper -- New\r\n     Yorkers -- Senator Sumner's Gauntlet -- Prince Gortschakoff --\r\n     Governor Andrew -- New Englanders -- Re-elections -- Loyalty --\r\n     Cruizers -- Matamoras -- Hurrah for Lincoln -- Rosecrans --\r\n     Strategy -- Sabine Pass, etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 1: L. B._--Jeff Davis is to emancipate eight hundred\r\nthousand slaves--calls them to arms, and promises fifty acres of\r\nland to each. Prodigious, marvellous, wonderful--if true. Jeff Davis\r\nwill become immortal! With eight hundred thousand Africo-Americans\r\nin arms, Secession becomes consolidated--and Emancipation a fixed\r\nfact, as the eight hundred thousand armed will emancipate themselves\r\nand their kindred. Lincoln emancipates by tenths of an inch, Jeff\r\nDavis by the wholesale. But it is impossible, as--after all--such a\r\nstep of the rebel chiefs is as much or even more, a death-warrant of\r\ntheir political existence, as the eventual and definitive victory of\r\nthe Union armies would be. If the above news has any foundation in\r\ntruth, then the sacredness of the principle of right and of liberty\r\nis victoriously asserted in such a way as never before was any great\r\nprinciple. The most criminal and ignominious enterprise recorded in\r\nhistory, the attempt to make human bondage the corner-stone of an\r\nindependent polity, this attempt ending in breaking the corner-stone\r\nto atoms, and by the hands of the architects and builders\r\nthemselves. Satan's revolt was virtuous, when compared with that of\r\nthe Southern slavers, and Satan's revolt ended not in transforming\r\nHell into an Eden, as will be the South for the slaves when their\r\nemancipation is accomplished. Emancipation, _n'importe par qui_,\r\nmust end in the reconstruction of the Union.\r\n\r\n_September 2: L. B._--Garibaldi to Lincoln. The letter, if genuine, is\r\nwell-intentioned trash. I am afraid that this prolific letter-writing\r\nwill use up Garibaldi. It seems that in letter-writing Garibaldi\r\nintends to rival Lincoln or Seward.\r\n\r\n_September 3: L. B._--More and more manifestations in favor of\r\nLincoln's re-election. All the New York Republican papers begin to\r\nbe lined with Lincoln. And thus politicians in and out of the press\r\nwill--\r\n\r\n  _Incubuerunt mare (people) totumque a sedibus imis._\r\n\r\n_September 3: L. B._--In the great Barnum diplomatic tour, Seward\r\nkilled under him nearly all the diplomats, and returned to Washington\r\nin company with one. Poor Europe, and its representatives, to be used\r\nup in such a way! But it is only the official Europe, the crowned\r\nprivileged stratum patched up with rotten relics of massacre (December\r\n2d,) of official, regal heartlessness and of servile cunning. That\r\ncrust presses down the genuine Europe, the marrow of mankind. The\r\ngenuine Europe is ardent, noble, progressive and coruscant; and from\r\nCadiz to the White Sea, that genuine Europe is on the side of freedom,\r\non the side of the North.\r\n\r\n_September 3: L. B._--Lincoln to Grant, July 13. This letter shows\r\nhow the President dabbles in military operations. It clearly\r\nestablishes Mr. Lincoln's right to be considered at least a Carnot,\r\nif not a Napoleon, _vide_ the Republican newspapers.\r\n\r\n_September 3: L. B._--State Conventions, and the old party-hacks\r\nunder arms. Will not the younger generation rise in its might, break\r\nthe chains of this intellectual subserviency, scatter the hacks to\r\nthe winds, take the lead, enlighten the masses, find out new, not\r\nused-up men, brains and hearts, for the sacred duty of serving the\r\npeople. To witness so much intelligence, knowledge, ardor,\r\nelasticity, clear-sightedness as animate the American youth, to\r\nwitness all this subdued, curbed by the hacks!--O, youth, awake!\r\n\r\nIt is the most sacred duty of the younger generation, to rescue the\r\ncountry from the hands of the old politicians of every kind; to call\r\nto political paramount activity the better and purer agencies. It is\r\na task as emphatically, nay, even more, urgent and meritorious than\r\nemancipation of the Africo-Americans.\r\n\r\n_September 4: L. B._--In their official or unofficial quality,\r\nnumerous Americans amorously dabble in International questions and\r\nlaws. How much the _rights of war_, etc., have been discussed; how\r\nmany letters, signed, anonymous, official and unofficial, have been\r\npublished--and very little, if any light thrown on these questions.\r\nWhat a cruel fate of a future historian, who, if conscientious, will\r\nbe obliged to read all these darkness-spreading lucubrations!\r\n\r\n_September 5: L. B._--Mr. Lincoln's letter to the Illinois\r\nConvention stirs up the whole country. It is a very, _very_ good\r\nmanifesto,--had it not a terrible YESTERDAY. It is a heavy bid for\r\nre-election and may secure it. The Americans forget the _yesterday_,\r\nand Mr. Lincoln's _yesterday!_ ... is full of shiftings,\r\nhesitations, mistakes which draw out the people's life-blood. The\r\npeople will forget that a man of energy and of firm purpose in the\r\nWhite House, such a man would have at once clearly seen his way, and\r\nthen a year ago rebellion and slavery would have been crushed.\r\n\r\nA man of energy would not have had for his familiar demons, the\r\nScotts, the Sewards, the Blairs, the border-state politicians, the\r\nWeeds, etc.\r\n\r\n_September 5: L. B._--The siege of Charleston _tire en longueur_; it\r\nhas cost thousand of lives and millions upon millions, and will\r\nstill cost more. And it is already forgotten that when nearly two\r\nyears ago Sherman and Dupont took Port Royal, Charleston and\r\nSavannah were defenceless; it is forgotten that Sherman asked for\r\norders to siege the two cities, _but such were not given_ from\r\nWashington, because Mr. Lincoln-Seward (literally) was afraid to get\r\npossession of the focuses of rebellion, and General McClellan, with\r\none hundred and fifty thousand men in Washington, could not bear the\r\nidea that the rebels should be disturbed either in Centerville or in\r\ntheir _chivalric_ homes in South Carolina. It is forgotten that\r\ncivil and military leaders and chiefs then and there refused to deal\r\na death blow to the rebellion.\r\n\r\nAnd as I am _en train_ to recall to memory what is already\r\nforgotten, and what the Illinois letter intends to wholly erase from\r\nthe people's memory; I go on.\r\n\r\nIn the first days and months after the explosion of the rebellion,\r\nMr. Lincoln was as innocent of any wish to emancipate the slaves, as\r\ncould be a Seward, or a Yancey, or McClellan, or a Magruder or a\r\nWise or a Halleck. All this is forgotten. It is forgotten that\r\nGeneral Butler is the earliest initiator of emancipation, and that\r\nto him exclusively belongs the word and the fact of an emancipated\r\n_contraband_. It is forgotten that when Butler began to emancipate\r\nthe contrabands, the _big men_ in the Administration, Lincoln,\r\nGeneral Scott, and Seward, became almost frantic against Butler for\r\nthus introducing the \"nigger\" into the struggle. The fate of Fremont\r\nis forgotten. Fremont was ahead of the times. Fremont emancipated\r\nwhen Lincoln-Seward-Scott-Blair, etc., heartily wished to save and\r\npreserve slavery. Down went Fremont.\r\n\r\nEarly in the summer of 1861 General Fremont wished to do what was now\r\naccomplished by the, until yet, _sans pareil_ Grant--that is, to clear\r\nthe Mississippi at a time when neither Island No. 10, nor Vicksburgh,\r\nnor Port Hudson nor any other port was fortified. But the plan\r\ndispleased and frightened the powers in Washington. Fremont was never\r\nto be pardoned for having shown farsightedness when _the great men_\r\ndeliberately blindfolded themselves. Fremont might not be a Napoleon,\r\nnot a captain; Fremont committed military mistakes,--other generals\r\ncommit military crimes.\r\n\r\nThe angel of justice very easily will white-wash Fremont from\r\nmilitary responsibility for the unnecessary waste of human life; and\r\nwith all his various faults Fremont's aspirations are patriotic and\r\nlofty, and he is by far a better and nobler man than all his\r\nrevilers put together. But all this seems to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nIt is, or will be forgotten, what a bloody trail over the North is\r\nleft, and has been imprinted by the half measures, the indecisions,\r\nand the vascillations of the Administration.\r\n\r\nThe medley composed of politicians, jobbers, contractors, and\r\nnewspapers, already scream \"Hosanna,\" and attempt to spatter with\r\nlies and dust the road to the White House, and thus to prepare the\r\nway. And the medley already shakes hands, and enemies kiss each\r\nother, because if their _elect_ succeeds, there will be peace over,\r\nand pickings for all the world. But the justice of history will\r\novertake them all, and the better, younger generation will crush\r\nthem to atoms.\r\n\r\n_September 6. L. B._--Wilkes' _Spirit of the Times_ maintains its\r\nparamount, independent position in the American press. I cannot\r\ndetect any shadow of a politician in its columns. It is all over\r\nindependent and patriotic. The _Spirit_ fights the miscreants.\r\n\r\n\"_Principles not men_,\" is an axiom, but the axiom must be well\r\nunderstood and applied, and it has its limitations. Are bad,\r\nworthless, insincere, selfish men to be the agencies and the factors\r\nof great and lofty principles? Is such a thing possible? Is the\r\nexample of Judas forgotten? O, you Bible-reading people, can Judases\r\nand rotten consciences carry out good principles? The press that\r\nteaches and preaches _principles not men_, that never dares to\r\nattack bad men in its own ranks, such a press betrays the confidence\r\nof the people, and degrades below expression the elevated and noble\r\nposition which the press ought to occupy in the development of the\r\nprogress of human society.\r\n\r\n_September 6._--Computing together and comparing the mental and\r\nintellectual characteristics, the manifestations and utterances of\r\npassions in the Africo American and in the Irish of the Iro-Roman\r\nnursery, the anthropologist, the psychologist and the philosopher\r\nmust give the palm to the Africo-American. And nevertheless Doctors\r\nof Divinity and many truly religious men plead in favor of slavery,\r\nthat is, of brute force. I ask all such to meditate the words of\r\nProfessor J. W. DRAPER, in his great and profound _History of the\r\nIntellectual Development of Europe: That brute force must give way\r\nto intellect, and that even the meanest human being has rights in\r\nthe sight of God._\r\n\r\n_September 10: New York._--Head-quarters of all kinds of politicians,\r\nof schemers, of perpetrators of treasonable attempts, of falsifiers,\r\nof poisoners of the people's mind. The rendezvous of those who\r\ndevour the vitals of the country--who, as contractors, jobbers,\r\nbrokers, stock and gold speculators, _agioteurs_, etc. are the most\r\nardent patriots, and wish that the war may be indefinitely\r\ncontinued. In the columns of the _Herald_ the future historian will\r\nfind the best information concerning all that--not-blessed race. The\r\nrace deserves to be recorded and _scavenged_ in the _Herald_.\r\n\r\nAnd nevertheless New York contains the most pure and the most\r\ndevoted patriots. New York and New Yorkers have been foremost in\r\ncoming to the rescue when the matricide rebels dealt their first\r\nblow. From New York came the best and the most energetic urgings on\r\nthe gasping and vascillating Administration.\r\n\r\nThe New Yorkers originated the Sanitary Commission, for which I can\r\nfind no words of sufficiently warm praise. New York contains many\r\nyoung, fresh, elevated and noble minds and intellects. Why, O why do\r\nsome of them disappear in the muddy part of the great city, and\r\nothers are overawed and overleaped by the hacks and by the\r\npoliticians, or the so-called wire-pullers.\r\n\r\n_September 10. New York._--It is the place to ascertain the\r\nmanoeuvres of political schemers. Those who know, most emphatically\r\nassure me of the existence of the following _Sewardiana_.\r\n\r\n1. Seward has given up in despair all dreams of finding people to\r\nback him for the next Presidency.\r\n\r\n2. Seward hesitated between McClellan and Banks,\r\n\r\n3. And finally settled on Lincoln;\r\n\r\n4. And although afraid of being finally shelved by Lincoln, he\r\nadvocates Lincoln's re-election--\r\n\r\n5. As being the paramount means to politically murder Chase.\r\n\r\nOh American people! Oh American people! how those foul political\r\npilferers dice for thy blood and thy destinies!\r\n\r\nYears ago, I justified the existence and asserted the necessity of\r\npoliticians in the political public life of America. I considered\r\nthem an unavoidable and harmless result of free democratic\r\ninstitutions. [See \"America and Europe.\"] At that time I observed\r\nthe politician from a distance, and reasoned on him altogether\r\nmetaphysically, after the so-called German fashion. Since 1861 I\r\nhave come into personal contact with the genus politician--and oh!\r\nwhat a monstrous breed they are!\r\n\r\n_September 10. New York._--Senator Sumner on our foreign relations.\r\nThe Senator enumerates all the violations of good comity, of\r\ninternational duties, of the obligations of neutrals, violations so\r\ndeliberately and so maliciously perpetrated by England and by\r\nFrance. But why has the Senator forgotten to ascend to one of the\r\nparamount causes? Previous to England or France, the State\r\nDepartment in Washington and Mr. Lincoln recognized in the rebels\r\n_the condition of belligerents_. It was done by the Proclamation\r\ninstituting the blockade. The _Blue Book_ fully proves that already\r\nmonths before Mr. Lincoln's inauguration the English Government had\r\na perfect knowledge of the vascillating policy which was to be\r\ninaugurated after March 1, 1861. At the same time, the English\r\nGovernment knew well that already previous to March 4, the rebel\r\nconspirators were fully decided on carrying out their treacherous\r\naim across streams of blood. A long war was imminent, and a\r\nrecognition of the rebels as _in parte_ belligerents, could not have\r\nbeen avoided. A part of the English nation, a part of the English\r\nCabinet, was and is overflowing with the most malicious ill will,\r\nand such ones crave for an occasion to satisfy their hatred. But our\r\ndomestic and foreign policy singularly served our English\r\nill-wishers.\r\n\r\nI deeply regret that the Senator preferred the halls of the Cooper\r\nInstitute to the hall of the United States Senate; that he threw the\r\ngauntlet to Europe as a lecturer, when for days and months he could\r\nhave done it so authoritatively as a Senator of the United States;\r\ncould have done it from his senatorial chair, and in the fulfilment\r\nof the most sacred public and patriotic duty. How could the Senator\r\nthus belittle one of the most elevated political positions in the\r\nworld, that of a Senator of the United States?\r\n\r\nNot so happy is the part of the lecture concerning _Intervention_.\r\nIt is rather sentimental than statesmanlike. _Intervention_ is, and\r\nwill remain, an act of physical, material force, and history largely\r\nteaches that _Intervention_, even for higher moral purposes, was\r\nalways exercised by the strong against the weak, the strong always\r\ninvoking \"higher motives.\" Thus did the Romans; and about a century\r\nago, the Powers which partitioned Poland began by an _Intervention_,\r\njustified on \"higher moral, etc. grounds.\"\r\n\r\n_September 11: New York._--Prince Gortschakoff's answer to the\r\ndemonstration of lying, hypocritical, official diplomatic sympathies\r\nmade in favor of the Poles by the cabinets of France, of England,\r\nand of Austria. The Gortschakoff notes are masterpieces for their\r\nclear, quiet, but bold and decided exposition and argument, and in\r\nthe records of diplomacy those notes will occupy the most prominent\r\nplace. O, why cannot Mr. Seward learn from Gortschakoff how not to\r\nput gas in such weighty documents? Could Seward learn how to be\r\nearnest, precise and clear, without spread-eagleism? The greater and\r\nstronger a nation, the less empty phraseology is needed when one\r\nspeaks in the nation's name.\r\n\r\n_September 15._--Returned to Washington. From what I see and hear,\r\nMr. Lincoln is earnestly and hard at work to secure his re-election.\r\nI hope that Mr. Lincoln is as earnest in his efforts to destroy\r\nLee's army and to put an end to the guerrillas who rob to the right\r\nand to the left, and under the nose of the supreme military\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nGovernor Andrew, of Massachusetts, always the same--active,\r\nintelligent, clear and far-sighted. Andrew is the man to act for,\r\nand in the name of the most intelligent community on the globe,\r\nwhich the State of Massachusetts undoubtedly is. As I have observed\r\nseveral times, Andrew is among the leading (_Americanize_, tip-top,)\r\nmen of the younger generation, is no politician, and never was one.\r\nIf a civilian is to be elected to the Presidency, Andrew ought to be\r\nthe choice of the people, if the people will be emancipated from the\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\nI learn that that monster, the politician, has almost wholly\r\ndisappeared from New England, above all from Massachusetts. The New\r\nEngland people are too earnest and too intelligent to be the prey of\r\nthe monster. Sound reason throttled the politician. All hail to this\r\nresult of the bloody storm! I hope the other States will soon follow\r\nthe example of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe State of Massachusetts and the city of Boston noiselessly spend\r\nmillions for their coast and harbor defences. Governor Andrew has\r\nthe confidence of the people, and is untiring in procuring the best\r\nwar material. He sent an agent to England to buy heavy guns.\r\n\r\nIf the English government take in sail, if it come to its senses and\r\ncease to be the rebels' army and navy arsenal, then all this will be\r\ndue to such quiet and decisive active demonstrations as that above\r\nmentioned in Boston, in Massachusetts, and the similar activity of\r\nthe New Yorkers, and not at all to any persuasive arguments of Mr.\r\nSeward's dispatches.\r\n\r\n_September 16._--Mr. Seward is slightly mending his ways. His last\r\ncircular for the foreign market is considerably sobered, and almost\r\nbarren of prophecy. Almost no spread-eagleism, no perversion,\r\nalthough geography and history, of course, are a little maltreated.\r\n\r\nAnd so, Mr. Prophet, you at least recognize the utility of arming\r\nthe Africo-Americans. And who is it that openly and by secret advice\r\nand influence in the cabinet and out of it, who, during more than a\r\nyear, did his utmost to counteract all the efforts to emancipate and\r\nto arm the oppressed?\r\n\r\n_September 16._--The draft is seriously complained of, and the\r\ndrafted desert in all directions. To tell the truth, drafting is\r\nodious to every nation, whatever be its government. But it is a dire\r\nnecessity, and it is impossible to avoid or to turn it. The draft\r\nbecame here imperatively necessary by the long uninterrupted chain\r\nof helplessness and mismanagement of events, the sacrifice of blood\r\nand of time. But for the advice of the Scotts, of the Sewards, of\r\nthe Blairs, but for the military prowess of McClellan and his\r\n_minions_, but for the high military science of a Halleck, Mr.\r\nLincoln would not have been obliged to draft.\r\n\r\nIn the West, everything is action, operation and victory. Grant,\r\nRosecrans, Banks, their officers and soldiers honor the American\r\nname; even good Burnside acts and succeeds;--but here the Army of\r\nthe Potomac is observing and watching Lee's brow! McClellan's spirit\r\nseems still to permeate these blessed generals, and then\r\nHalleckiana, and then God knows what. The fear of losing won laurels\r\nprobably palsies the brains of the commanders; at any rate it is\r\ncertain that the inactivity of the Potomac army throws unsurpassed\r\nsplendor on the annals of this war. O, the brave, brave soldiers and\r\nofficers! how they are maltreated!\r\n\r\n_September 16._--Matamoras will fall into the hands of the\r\n_Decembriseur's_ freebooters, and then Texas will be almost lost.\r\nMatamoras ought long ago to have been seized by us, or at least very\r\nclosely blockaded and surrounded; then all the war-contraband to\r\nTexas would have had an end.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, when microscopical specks began to loom over Mexico's\r\ndestinies, when the _Decembriseur_ began to feel the pulse of Spain\r\nand of England, I most respectfully suggested to Mr. Seward to\r\nblockade Matamoras. No foreign country or government could call us\r\nto account for such a step, if the Mexican government would not\r\nprotest. And it was so easy to satisfy and hush the Mexican\r\nliberals. Besides, a paragraph in the treaty of Mexico expressly\r\nstipulates that any violation of the respective territory will not\r\nbe considered as a _casus belli_, but the case will be peacefully\r\ninvestigated, etc., etc. Surely the Mexican government would have\r\npreferred to see Matamoras in our hands, than in those of that\r\nbloody Forey's bands.\r\n\r\n_September 17._--\"Loyalty,\" \"loyalty,\" resounds from all sides.\r\nLoyalty to principles? Why, no. Loyalty to Mr. Lincoln and to his\r\nofficial crew. If such maxims mark not the downfall of manhood, then\r\nI am at loss to find what does. Such a construction of loyalty\r\nbrings many otherwise honest and intelligent men to foster Mr.\r\nLincoln's re-election.\r\n\r\n_September 17._--At the beginning of the war, Lord John Russell\r\nissued orders for the regulation of the English ports in cases of\r\nbelligerents. Our great Doctor of International Law in the State\r\nDepartment mistook such municipal, English regulations; he considers\r\nthem to be absolute international rules and principles, and\r\nconcocts instructions for our cruisers, instructions which smell as\r\nif written under Lord Lyons' dictation. As always, Neptune stands up\r\nfor the national interests and for the interests of his tars,\r\nbecause the instructions concocted by the Doctor make it impossible\r\nfor our cruisers to fulfill their duties. As always, Mr. Lincoln\r\nbends rather towards the Doctor, who in his world-embracing\r\n_humanitarianism_ defends the interests of all the neutrals at the\r\ncost of the interests of the country and of our brave navy. The\r\nDoctor was right when, some time ago, he compared himself to Christ.\r\n\r\n_September 17._--The border-State politicians establish that the\r\nrevolted States are not out of the Union. The States are no\r\nabstractions, no metaphysical notions, but geographical and\r\npolitical entities. They are States because they are peopled with\r\nindividuals, free, intelligent, and who, to give a legality to their\r\nrebellion, claim to be sovereigns. It is not the soil constituting a\r\nState that represents a sovereignty, but the soil or State acquires\r\npolitical signification through the population dwelling in or on it.\r\nWhen the population revolted, the State revolted. From Jeff Davis to\r\nthe lowest \"clay-eater,\" each rebel who took up arms claims to have\r\ndone this in the exercise of his sovereign will and choice. The\r\nrevolt quashed all privileges conceded by the Union to a State, and\r\nthe Union reconquers its property in reconquering the former States.\r\n\r\n_September 18._--Hurrah for Lincoln! He sends an expedition to\r\nTexas, say his admirers. He forgets nothing. Well, why has Lincoln\r\nforgotten Texas all this time? Notwithstanding all the prayers of\r\nthe Texans and of the northern patriots, I am not sure that at this\r\nmoment it is expedient to break up our armies into smaller\r\nexpeditions instead of concentrating them in Tennessee, Georgia, and\r\nhere. Strike on the head or at the heart if you wish to kill the\r\nmonster, but not at its extremities. But perhaps the Government and\r\nHalleck have men enough to do the one and the other. But why not put\r\nat the head of the Texan expedition a noble, high-minded, devoted\r\npatriot, such as General Hamilton, instead of putting a Franklin,\r\nunknown to the Texans, who can inspire no confidence, and of whom\r\nthe best that can be said is, that he never succeeded in anything,\r\nand disorganized everything. See Pope in Virginia, Burnside at\r\nFredericksburgh.\r\n\r\nIf Hamilton, the Texan, is to participate in this expedition, not\r\nLincoln and his advisers put Hamilton there--the pressure exercised\r\nby the combined efforts of the governors of New England States did\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\nHurrah for Lincoln and for his crew.\r\n\r\n_September 19._--Governor Andrew's activity and initiative are\r\nadmirable. More than any body in the country, Andrew has done to\r\nclear up, and to firmly establish the condition of Africo-Americans\r\nas soldiers, and to push them up to the level with other men.\r\n\r\n_September 19._--_Hurrah for Lincoln_, who hurries the organization\r\nof Africo-American regiments! Oh yes! he hurries them; _festina\r\nlente_. And how many regiments have been organized in Norfolk, which\r\nought to have been established as _the_ central point to attract\r\nand to organize contrabands? Is not Virginia the first in the slave\r\nStates for the number of slaves? In the hands of a clear-sighted\r\nman, Norfolk ought to have been used as a glue to which the slaves\r\nwould have wandered from all parts of Virginia, and even from North\r\nCarolina. Norfolk ought to have to-day an army of fifty thousand\r\nAfrico-Americans born in Virginia, and not a few regiments of them\r\nraised in the North. An Africo-American army in Norfolk doubtless\r\nwould have more impressed Jeff Davis and Lee, than they are\r\nimpressed by the marches of the commanders of the Potomac army. And\r\nwhat is done? Oh, hurrah for Lincoln! A General Naglee, or of some\r\nother name, appointed by Halleck, sustained by Lincoln, and by, who\r\nknows whom--commands in Norfolk. This general so appointed, and so\r\nsustained is the most devoted worshipper of slavery. This favored\r\ngeneral hob-nobs with the slave-making, slave-breeding and\r\nslave-selling aristocracy of Norfolk and of the vicinity, looks down\r\nupon the _nigger_ with all the haughtiness of a plantation whip, and\r\nhaughtily snubs off the not slave-breeding Union men in Norfolk, the\r\nmechanics, and the small farmers. Mr. Lincoln knows this all and\r\nkeeps the general. Rhetors roar, Hurrah for Lincoln.\r\n\r\n_September 19._--Massachusetts and New England men and women! you\r\ntrue apostles! your names are unknown but they are recorded by the\r\ngenius of humanity. These men and women feel what is the true\r\napostolate. They follow our armies, take care of the contrabands,\r\ntake care of poor whites, establish schools for the children and for\r\nthe grown up of both hues, and thus they reorganize society. O\r\nsneer at them you fashionables, you flirts, you ...; but such men\r\nand women, and not you, make one believe in the highest destinies of\r\nour race.\r\n\r\n_September 20._--Grant is the only general who accomplished an\r\nobject, showed high, soldier-like qualities, organized and commanded\r\nan excellent army. But scarcely had _Grant_ taken Vicksburgh, when\r\nhis army was broken up and scattered in all directions, he himself\r\nwas neutralized and reduced to inactivity. It could be considered a\r\ncrime against the people's cause--but--hurrah for Lincoln.\r\n\r\nAfter the shame of Corinth, 1862, the Western army disappeared in\r\nthe same way. But it was nobody's fault, oh no! So it is nobody's\r\nfault that Grant is shelved. Will a man start up in the next\r\nCongress and call the malefactors to account?\r\n\r\n_September 20._--This day, General Meade has about eighty thousand\r\nmen. General Meade himself estimates the enemy's forces in front of\r\nhim at no more than forty thousand men, and General Meade does\r\nnothing beyond feeling his way. O, cunctator!\r\n\r\n_September 20._--The partisans of Mr. Lincoln admit that he came\r\nslowly _to the mark_, but he came to it. Of course, better late than\r\nnever, but in Mr. Lincoln's case, the people's honor and the\r\npeople's blood paid for Mr. Lincoln's experimental ways. Mr. Lincoln\r\nmay now be serious in a great many matters, but if he could have\r\nbeen serious a year ago--how much money would have been economized?\r\n\r\nHurrah for Lincoln!\r\n\r\n_September 21._--Rosecrans worsted. Burnside joined him not. They\r\nsay that Burnside disobeyed orders. I doubt it, and would wish to\r\nsee what orders have been given. Meade or Halleck quietly allow a\r\nthird of Lee's army to go and help to crush Rosecrans.\r\n\r\n_September 21._--General Franklin was, in his own way, successful at\r\nthe Sabine Pass, as every where. But how could the government\r\nentrust him with this expedition? He graduated _first_ at West\r\nPoint. Washingtonians and tip-top West Pointers speak highly of\r\nFranklin. Enough!--\r\n\r\n_September 22._--The rebels concentrated every available and\r\nfighting man on Chattanooga; we scattered our forces to all winds.\r\nThe rebels march on concentrating lines, we select radii running out\r\nin the infinite, or in opposite directions. That is the head\r\nquarters paramount strategy.\r\n\r\nRosecrans is worsted. Hurrah for Lincoln, who believes in Halleck!\r\n\r\nAnd to know, as I know, that our army and country has young men who\r\ncould carry on the war better in darkness than Lincoln-Halleck do in\r\nbroad daylight!\r\n\r\n_September 22._--By depleting the banks by means of loans, by\r\nestablishing the so-called National Bank, by creating an army of\r\nofficials, by taking into his hands the traffic in the great staple\r\nof the rebel States, by providing the South with the various\r\nNorthern products, by holding all the money in his hand, Mr. Chase\r\nconcentrated into his hand a patronage never held by any secretary,\r\nnay, scarcely if ever, held by a president. Mr. Chase has more\r\npatronage than even any constitutional king. It is to be seen how\r\nall this will end.\r\n\r\n_September 22._--On all sides I hear the question put, Who is\r\nGilmore? It seems to me that Gilmore is one of the men generated by\r\nnew events and not by Washington or West Point estimation. It seems\r\nto me that Gilmore may be one of the representative men of the\r\nbetter generation, so luxuriant here, and whose advent to power\r\nwould save the country; a generation who alone can give the last\r\nsolution, and whose advent I expect as the Jews expected the\r\nMessiah, and I shall hail it as did Anna, Elizabeth, Simeon, etc.\r\nput together.\r\n\r\n_September 23._--As a result of the Meade-Halleck combined military\r\nwisdom, a part of Lee's army fought Rosecrans at Chattanooga, and\r\nmay in a very short time be again in Virginia, and it is nobody's\r\nfault. O strategy! thy name is imbecility!\r\n\r\n_September 23._--Better news from Rosecrans. The stubbornness of the\r\ntroops, the stubbornness of General Thomas saved the day.\r\nReinforcements join Rosecrans now. But why not previous to the\r\nbattle? If Rosecrans had had men enough on the 19th and 20th, then\r\nBragg would have been broken, and the rebels almost on their last\r\nlegs. But perhaps such glory and victory are not needed! Hurrah for\r\nLincoln!\r\n\r\n_September 24._--Many of Mr. Lincoln's partisans admit that at the\r\nmost favorable calculation, the results obtained up to to-day by the\r\nwar and by emancipation, could easily have been obtained by a\r\nsmaller expenditure of life, blood, money and time, if any will, and\r\nforesight, and energy presided at the helm. And, nevertheless,\r\nhurrah for Lincoln! And the highest destinies of the principle of\r\nself-government to again be trusted in such hands!\r\n\r\n_September 24._--How could Meade let Lee send troops to Bragg, and\r\nwhy Meade attacked or attacks not? Those rebel generals show but\r\nlittle consideration for our commanders, and it would be curious to\r\nknow what Lee and his companions think of our Marses. It seems that\r\na conception of a plan of campaign or of a military operation is\r\naltogether beyond the reach of Meade's _cerebellum_. As commander of\r\na division, of a corps, Meade had _dash in him_--he lost all when\r\nelevated above the level.\r\n\r\nI am sure that Stanton urges or urged Meade to do something, without\r\ntelling him how or where. Had Lincoln, had Halleck meddled? If so,\r\nMeade ought to tell it. The best to do for a commander of the Army\r\nof the Potomac is to keep his secrets to himself and have in his\r\nconfidence only his chief-of-staff--not to tell them to any one in\r\nthe camp, and still less to any one in Washington. But it seems that\r\nMeade had no plan whatever in view, and had no secrets to keep or\r\nto tell.\r\n\r\n_September 25._--It is to-day exactly a week since Rosecrans was\r\nattacked. At the head-quarters they ought to have known Rosecrans'\r\nforce, and the imperative, the paramount necessity of reinforcing\r\nhim in time, as they _ought_ to have known that Lee sent to Bragg a\r\npart of his army. But probably the precious head of the\r\nhead-quarters is confused by some translation, or by reading\r\nproof-sheets instead of reports. By simply looking on the map, the\r\nhead-quarters--perhaps headless--ought to have found out that\r\nChattanooga and Atlanta are the keys of the black country, and that\r\nthe rebels--who neither write silly books nor translate--will\r\nconcentrate all available forces to stop Rosecrans's advance, and\r\neventually to crush him. Weeks ago the head-quarters ought to have\r\nreinforced Rosecrans; it is done to-day, a week after the defeat.\r\nHurrah for Lincoln, who sustains a Halleck!\r\n\r\nOne of the most cautious men that I met in life, and who is in a\r\nposition to be well informed, in the most cautious and distant\r\nmanner suggested to me that Rosecrans is obnoxious to the\r\nhead-quarters, and that in G street, Washington, they may have\r\nwished to see Rosecrans worsted.\r\n\r\nHurrah for Lincoln! Halleck is his true prophet!\r\n\r\nShake an apple tree, and the foul fruit falls down; and so it is\r\nwith Halleck's western military combinations. All the army of Grant\r\nrunning dispersed on centrifugal radii, Burnside sent in a direction\r\nopposite to Rosecrans. Bravo, Halleck! You outdo McClellan!\r\n\r\n_September 25._--It seems that with a little, a very little dash, we\r\ncould go in the rear of Lee, who is weakened by sending troops to\r\ncrush Rosecrans. But we have given Lee time to fortify his position,\r\nand of course we will wait until Lee is again strong, either by\r\nposition or by numbers. Then we march a few miles onwards, more\r\nmiles backwards, and what not? What splendid combinations coruscate\r\nfrom the head-quarters here, or in the army! Cæsar, Napoleon,\r\nFrederick, bow your heads in dust before our great captains!\r\n\r\n_September 26._--It seems that at Chattanooga the rebels massed\r\ntheir infantry in columns _per_ battalion, and Crittenden's and\r\nMcCook's troops could not withstand the attack. It was not at West\r\nPoint that the rebel generals learned the like continental tactics.\r\nIt seems that the rebels like to learn.\r\n\r\n_September 27._--In defence of the _Franklinade_ at the Sabine Pass,\r\nit is alleged that the expedition had bad old vessels, and was\r\npoorly fitted out. Then why make it? It is a crime in this country\r\nto complain of any want of material and of bad vessels--provided no\r\none steals thereby. In America, not to have an adequate material?\r\nWhat an infamous slander on the most industrious people! Not\r\nmaterial, but brains, or something else are not adequate. But, of\r\ncourse, it is nobody's fault, and nobody will be taken to account.\r\n\r\n_September 29._--Hooker is to have a command, and to supersede\r\nBurnside. Probably again a separate command. If generals refuse to\r\nserve under each other, under the plea of seniority, at once expel\r\nsuch _recalcitrant_ generals from the service; better and younger\r\nmen will be found. The French Convention beheaded such generals, not\r\non paper, but physiologically. The French Directory was not a master\r\nof honesty or energy, but it had sufficient energy to select\r\nNapoleon, twenty-six years old, over the heads of older generals,\r\nand put him in command of the Army of the Alps, which in his hands\r\nbecame the Army of Italy. And as long as the world shall stand, the\r\nconsequences of that violation of the rule of seniority will not be\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\n_September 29._--General Thomas ought to have the command, if\r\nRosecrans failed, but not Hooker or Butterfield.\r\n\r\nHalleck's _officina_ of military incongruities and to unmilitary\r\ncombinations ought to be shut up, and the occupants sent about the\r\nworld. The War Department and the President would get better advice\r\nfrom the young Colonels in the Department, and around Stanton, than\r\nit gets from all that concern in G street.\r\n\r\n_September 29._--The papers say that all over Europe and the rest of\r\nthe world Seward _ex officio_ scatters Sumner's Cooper Institute\r\noration. Well may Seward do it. Sumner suppressed true events, not\r\nto hurt Seward.\r\n\r\nNow Sumner will find Seward an admirable statesman.\r\n\r\n_September 30._--The suspension of the _habeas corpus_ makes great\r\nnoise. It was emphatically necessary. But it would not have been\r\nemphatically, indeed not in the least necessary, if the domestic and\r\nwar policy were different. Then the people would not have been\r\ndisheartened. If the people's holy enthusiasm--so dreaded in\r\nWashington--were not so sacrilegiously misused and squandered,\r\nvolunteers would be forthcoming.\r\n\r\n_September 30._--If Lincoln-Halleck could create a military\r\ndepartment on the moon, they would instantly send thither some\r\ntroops and a major-general, so strong is their passion to break up\r\nthe armies into fragmentary bodies.\r\n\r\n_September 30._--If this war has already devoured or destroyed three\r\nhundred thousand men in dead, crippled, and disabled in various\r\nways, then the responsibility is to be divided as follows:\r\n\r\n_a_ 100,000 lost by the policy initiated by Lincoln, Seward, Scott.\r\n\r\n_b_ 100,000 to be credited to McClellan and Halleck's military\r\ncombinations; Halleck by half with Lincoln.\r\n\r\n_c_ 100,000 to be credited to the war itself.\r\n\r\n_September 30._--England mends her ways, and stops the arming of\r\nvessels for the rebels. The _Decembriseur_ more and more\r\ntreacherous--as a matter of course.\r\n\r\n_September 30._--I understand now, what I never could understand in\r\nEurope. I understand how an all polluting power can force into\r\nalliance men of strong convictions, but of the most deadly opposite\r\nsocial and political extremes. Such extremes meet in the wish to put\r\nan end to a power whom they hate and despise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOCTOBER, 1863.\r\n\r\n     Aghast -- Firing -- Supported -- Russian Fleet -- Opposition --\r\n     Amor scelerated -- Cautious -- Mastiffs -- _Grande guerre_ --\r\n     Manoeuvring -- Tambour battant -- Warning, etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 1._--Rosecrans, Bragg, Lee, Meade, Gilmore, Dahlgren and\r\nthe iron-clads keep the nation breathless aghast. A terrible and\r\npainful lull. The politicians furiously continue their mole-like\r\nwork; election, re-election is inscribed on the mole hills.\r\n\r\n_October 2._--Chase men fire into Blair's men, and Blair's men are\r\nsupposed to be Lincoln's men. The skirmishing, the scouting before\r\nthe battle. But the day of battle is yet far off, and the proverb,\r\n\"many a slip,\" etc., may yet save the nation from becoming a prey of\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\n_October 3._--News arrives that reinforcements sent from here\r\nreached Rosecrans. For the first time the troops have been\r\nforwarded with such rapidity. The War Department has brought almost\r\nto perfection the system of transportation of large bodies. The\r\nhead-quarters, who combine, decide and direct the movements, the\r\ndistribution, and the scattering of troops all over the country\r\ncould have therefore ordered the troops to Rosecrans, and the War\r\nDepartment would have rapidly forwarded them there. And if Grant's\r\narmy was not broken, and he himself virtually shelved or\r\nneutralized--if he had marched towards Georgia, Secession would have\r\nbeen compressed to two or three States; Bragg crushed, Alabama and\r\nGeorgia rescued! Hurrah for Lincoln-Halleck.\r\n\r\n_October 4._--The Russian fleet evokes an unparalleled enthusiasm in\r\nNew York, and all over the country. _Attrappez_ treacherous England\r\nand France! The Russian Emperor, the Russian Statesman Gortschakoff,\r\nand the whole Russian people held steadfast and nobly to the North,\r\nto the cause of right and of freedom. Diplomatic bickerings here\r\ncould not destroy the genuine sympathy between the two nations.\r\n\r\n_October 4._--The probable majority in the next Congress is the\r\ngreat object of present calculation and speculation. The\r\nAdministration seems to be of the opinion, that a small republican\r\nmajority will do as well, because it will be more compact and more\r\neasily to be played upon. God save the country from a majority\r\n_twistable_ by the Administration! If the majority is small, then it\r\nmay be unable to drag such dead-weight as was the Administration\r\ndirected by its master spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Administration ought to be dusted and pruned. This\r\nAdministration especially needs to be shaken and kept always on the\r\n_qui vive_ by an honest and a patriotic opposition. The opposition\r\nmade by Copperheads is neither honest nor patriotic. Opposition is a\r\nvital element of parliamentary government; and as by a curse, the\r\nopposition here is made not to acts of the Administration--the\r\nCopperheads wish to throttle the principle which inspires the best\r\npart of the people. If it was possible to have an opposition strong\r\nenough to control the misdeeds of the Administration, to serve for\r\nthe Administration as a telescope to penetrate space, and as a\r\nmicroscope to find out the vermin: if such an opposition could be\r\nbuilt up, it would have forced the Administration to act vigorously\r\nand decidedly, it could have preserved the Administration from\r\nrepeated violations of the rules of common sense, and in certain\r\nAdministrative brains the opposition could have kindled sagacity and\r\nfarsightedness:--such counterpoise would have spared thousands and\r\nthousands of lives, and thousands of millions of money.\r\n\r\n_October 6._--Meade will retreat or already retreats. The choice of\r\nthe army, Meade, has not yet greatly justified itself. And Meade,\r\ntoo, builds up in the army a clique of generals, and therein Meade\r\nbegins to imitate McClellan. Likewise McClellan seems to have been\r\nMeade's model at Williamsport, and, McClellan-like, Meade has wasted\r\nprecious time.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the month of October sees us on the defensive on the whole\r\nline, from the Potomac to the Rio Grande. After two and a half years\r\nof military misdirection, of rivers of blood, of mines of\r\nmoney--there we are.\r\n\r\nHurrah for Lincoln and for his apostles!\r\n\r\n_October 6._--How the world's history is handled, twisted, and\r\n_bungled_. Wiseacres put history on the rack to evidence their own\r\nignorance. The one invokes England's example during Wellington's\r\nexpedition to Spain, as if that war in the Peninsula had been a\r\ncivil war, and England's integrity, national independence, and\r\npolitical institutions had been endangered. And another compares\r\nthis war to the civil wars of Rome, and censures the impatience of\r\nthose who wish for more energy in the Administration. Do the\r\nwiseacres wish for an\r\n\r\n  Altera jam teritur bellis civilibus ætas.\r\n\r\nOthers point to Cæsar, and forget that Cæsar fought almost in person\r\neverywhere, in Europe, Africa, and Asia.\r\n\r\nGreat commanders-in-chief point out to their subordinates the\r\nexample of Napoleon and of Frederick visiting their pickets. Yes,\r\ngreat military scholars! Frederick and Napoleon visited the pickets\r\nwhen their armies faced--nay, when they almost touched the lines of\r\nthe enemy. But Frederick and Napoleon were with the armies--they\r\nwere in the tents, and directed not the movements of armies from a\r\nwell warmed and cosy room or office.\r\n\r\n_October 6._--Blair, a member of the Cabinet, in a public speech\r\ndelivered in Maryland, most bitterly attacks the emancipationists\r\nand emancipation. Blair is perfectly true to himself. That speech\r\nwould honor a Yancey. Blair peddles for Mr. Lincoln's re-election.\r\nBlair thus semi-officially spoke for the President, and for the\r\nCabinet. Such at least is the construction put in England on an\r\nout-door speech made by a member of the Cabinet, or else another\r\nmember takes another occasion to refute the former. Mr. Splendid\r\nChase is a member of the Cabinet, and claims to represent there the\r\naspirations, the tendencies, and the aims of the radicals and of the\r\nemancipationists. Such a conflict between two members of the Cabinet\r\nshakes the shaky situation. What will Chase do? Nothing, or very\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n_October 7._--Months, weeks and days of the most splendid weather,\r\nand Meade, the choice of the West Point clique in the army, Meade\r\ndid nothing. If Meade had not, or has not troops enough, why is not\r\nFoster ordered here with all he has? Keep Fortress Monroe well\r\ngarrisoned, and for a time abandon the few points in North Carolina.\r\nDestroy Lee, and then a squad of invalids will reconquer North\r\nCarolina, or that State may then reconquer itself. This, or some\r\nother combination ought to be made. I am told that more than seven\r\nhundred thousand men are now on the Paymasters' rolls. Where are\r\nthey? Is it forgery or stealing? Where, oh where are the paid men?\r\nOn paper or in the grave? If the half, three hundred and fifty\r\nthousand men, were well kept in hand, Lee and Bragg ought to be\r\nannihilated.\r\n\r\nHurrah for Lincoln and Halleck!\r\n\r\n_October 8._--From various sides I am assured that Stanton passed\r\ninto the camp of Lincoln, with horse, foot and artillery. I doubt\r\nit, but--all is possible in this good-natured world. Stanton, like\r\nothers, may be stimulated by the _amor sceleratus_ of power.\r\n\r\n_October 8._--Lee's Report, containing the operations after the\r\nbattle of Chancellorsville, the invasion of Pennsylvania, and his\r\nrecrossing of the Potomac at Williamsport, is published now. But\r\nLee, a true soldier, made his report in the last days of July,\r\ntherefore almost instantly after the campaign was finished.\r\nSympathizers with McClellan's essays on military or on other\r\nmatters! there is another example for you, how and when such things\r\nought to be done. Meade has not yet made his Report.\r\n\r\n_October 9._--The cautiousness of Meade and his fidelity to\r\nMcClellan-like warfare are above admiration. General Buford, brave\r\nand daring, weeks ago offered to make with his cavalry a raid in the\r\nrear of Lee and destroy the railroads to the south-west--those main\r\narteries for Virginia. The offer was vetoed by the commander of the\r\nPotomac army. Had Lee ever vetoed Stewart's raids? Lee rather\r\nstimulated and directed them.\r\n\r\n_October 10._--And the power-holders let loose their mastiffs. And\r\nthe mastiffs ran at my heels and tried to tear my inexpressibles and\r\nall. And they did not, because they could not. Because my friends\r\n(J. H. Bradley,) stood by me. And the people's justice stepped in\r\nbetween the mastiffs and me, and I exclaim with the miller of\r\nPotsdam, \"There are judges in Washington.\"\r\n\r\n_October 11._--I most positively learn that even Thurlow Weed urged\r\nupon the President the immediate removal of Halleck, and even\r\nThurlow Weed could not prevail. Many and many sins be forgiven to\r\nthe Prince of the Lobby, to the man who understood how to fish out a\r\nfortune in these national troubles.\r\n\r\n_October 12._--_Cæsar morituri te salutant_, say our brave soldiers\r\nto Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe Meades and the McClellans, like most of the greatnesses of the\r\nWest Point clique, have no impulse, no sense for attack, because\r\nwhat is called _la grande guerre_, that is the offensive war, was\r\nnot among the special objects of the military education in West\r\nPoint. This is evident by the pre-eminence given to engineering, and\r\nto the engineers who represent the defensive war; and therefore the\r\ncontrast to the _grande guerre_. Some of our generals, as Grant,\r\nRosecrans, Reno, Reynolds, and others, and as I hear likewise of\r\nWarren, made and make up in enthusiasm for the deficiency of\r\nthe West Point education. But the majority of the _educated_\r\nPotomac commanders and generals were not, and are not much troubled\r\nby enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n_October 12._--In his answer to the Missouri patriotic deputation,\r\nMr. Lincoln, with one eye at least to the re-election, proves to\r\nthe observer that he, Lincoln, has not yet found out which party\r\nwill be the stronger when the election shall be at the door. Mr.\r\nLincoln has not yet made his choice between the radical, immediate\r\nemancipationists and those who wish a slow, do-nothing, successive,\r\n_pro rata_ emancipation. Not having yet found it out, Mr. Lincoln\r\nhas not yet fully decided which direction finally he has to take;\r\nand therefore he shifts a little to the right, a little to the left,\r\nand tries to hush up both parties. Our so characteristic military\r\noperations are closely connected with the vascillating policy and\r\nwith the hesitation to cut the knot.\r\n\r\n_October 13._--Unparalleled in the world's history is the manner in\r\nwhich the war is conducted here, from May, 1861, to this day. The\r\nannals of the Asiatic, ancient, and of modern Tartar warfare, the\r\nannals of Greece, of Macedon, of Rome, the annals of all wars fought\r\nin Europe since the overthrow of the Romans down to the day of\r\nSolferino, all have nothing similar to what is done here. This new\r\nmethod henceforth will constitute an epoch in military _un_-science.\r\n\r\n_October 13._--General Meade in full and quick retreat. The most\r\ncontradictory rumors and explications of this retreat; some of the\r\nexplications having even the flavor of official authority. One thing\r\nis certain, that when a general who confronted an enemy at once\r\nbegins to manoeuvre backwards, without having fought or lost a\r\nbattle, such a general is out-manoeuvred by his enemy. O for a young\r\nman with enthusiasm, and with inspiration! Suggested to Stanton to\r\nshun the men of Williamsport, or to look for enthusiasts such as\r\nWarren.\r\n\r\nChaos everywhere; chaos in the direction of affairs, and a\r\ndisgraceful chaos in the military operations. But as always, so this\r\ntime, it is nobody's fault.\r\n\r\nFetish McClellan finally and distinctly showed his hand, and joined\r\nthe Copperheads in the Pennsylvania election. McClellan is now ripe\r\nfor the dictatorship of the Copperheads. Will Mr. Lincoln have\r\ncourage to dismiss McClellan from the army? A self-respecting\r\nGovernment ought to do it. Let McClellan be taken care of by the\r\n_World_. _Par nobile fratrum._\r\n\r\n_October 14._--\r\n\r\n  _Nox erat et coelo fulgebat luna sereno_,\r\n\r\nand the virtuous city of Washington enjoyed the sleep of innocence:\r\nthe genius of the country was watchful. Halleck slept not.\r\nOrderlies, patrols, generals, officers, cavalry, infantry, all were\r\non their legs. Halleck took the command in person. What a running!\r\nFirst in the rooms, then in the streets and on the roads, and on the\r\nbridges whose planks were taken off. And thus about the cock's crow\r\nthe nightmare vanished, and Halleck, satisfied to have fulfilled his\r\nduty towards the country and towards the innocent Washingtonians,\r\nHalleck went to bed.\r\n\r\n_October 15._--Our head-quarters at Fairfax Court House. It is not\r\na retreat. O no! It is only splendid backward manoeuvring!\r\n\r\nAs far as the Virginia campaign is concerned, the situation to-day\r\nis below that previous to the first Bull Run. Lee menacing, going we\r\nknow not where; guerrillas in the rear of our army, at the\r\ngates--literally and geographically at the gates of Alexandria and\r\nof Washington. Previous to the first Bull Run, the country bled not;\r\nto-day the people is minus thousands and thousands of its children,\r\nand to see Lee twenty to thirty miles from Washington! What will be\r\nthe manoeuvring to-morrow?\r\n\r\nWarren fought well, but if Sykes was within supporting distance, why\r\ndid they not annihilate the rebel corps? Two corps ought not to have\r\nbeen afraid to be cut off from the rest of the army distant only a\r\nfew miles. Or perhaps orders exist not to bring about a general\r\nengagement? All is now possible and probable. _Our great plans may\r\nnot yet be ripe._\r\n\r\nWhen the smoke and dust of the manoeuvring will be over, I heartily\r\nwish that our losses in the retreat may prove innocent and as\r\ninsignificant as they are reported to be.\r\n\r\nOn the outside, Lee's movement appears as brilliant as it is\r\ndesperate. Has not this time Lee overshot the mark? Cunctator Meade\r\nmay have some lucid moment, and punish Lee for his impertinence. And\r\nevery and any thing can be done with our brave boys, provided they\r\nare commanded and generaled.\r\n\r\nIn military sciences and history, it would be said that Lee has\r\n_ramené tambour battant_ Meade under the defences of Washington.\r\nSuch a result obtained without a battle, counts among the most\r\nsplendid military accomplishments, and reveals true generalship.\r\n\r\n_October 17._--Meade was decided to retreat, even before Lee began\r\nto move, say the knowing ones, say the military authorities. If\r\nMeade wanted not to go to Culpepper Court-house, or to march towards\r\nthe enemy, or to occupy the head waters of those rivers, then why\r\nwas our army promenaded in that direction? To amuse the people? to\r\nincrease losses in men and in material? Was it done without any\r\nplan? I supposed, and the country supposed, that Meade marched south\r\nto fight Lee where he would have found him; but it turns out that it\r\nwas done in order to bring Lee towards Washington and towards the\r\nPotomac. What a snare!\r\n\r\n_October 17._--The electoral victory in Pennsylvania marks a new\r\nevolution in the internal _polity_ of the country. It is the victory\r\nof the younger and better men as represented by Curtin, by Coffey,\r\netc., over the old hacks, old sepulchres, old tricposters and over\r\nmen who sucked the treasury and the people's pocket; they did it\r\nscientifically, thoroughly, and with a coolness of masters. Oh!\r\ncould other States therein imitate Pennsylvania, then, the salvation\r\nof the country is certain.\r\n\r\n_October 17: Evening._--The knowing ones promise a battle for\r\nto-morrow. Yes, if Lee will. But if not, will Meade attack Lee? who\r\nI am sure will continue his movement and operation whatever these\r\nmay be. We are at _guessing_.\r\n\r\nRepeatedly and repeatedly it is half-officially trumpeted to the\r\ncountry, that this or that general selected his ground and awaits a\r\nbattle. It reminds one of the wars in Italy during the thirteenth\r\nand fourteenth centuries. And if the general who forced backwards\r\nhis antagonist, if he prefers not to attack, but continues to\r\nmanoeuvre, what becomes of the select, own ground? Who ever read\r\nthat Alexander, or Cesar, or Frederic, or Napoleon, or even captains\r\nof lesser fame, selected their ground? All of them fought the enemy\r\nwhere they found him, or by skillful manoeuvring hemmed the enemy or\r\nforced him to abandon his select position. Cases where a general can\r\nreally force the antagonist to attack _such a select, own ground_,\r\nsuch cases are special, and very rare.\r\n\r\nAnd so for the second time in this year, Lee shakes and disturbs our\r\nquiet in Washington. Oh why is Lee engaged on the bad and damnable\r\nside?\r\n\r\n_October 18._--A new _whereas_ calling for three hundred thousand\r\nvolunteers. The people will volunteer. Oh this great people is ready\r\nfor every sacrifice. But you, O you! who so recklessly waste all the\r\npeople's sacrifices, will you volunteer more brains and less\r\nselfishness?\r\n\r\n_October 18._--And when all the efforts of great men converged to\r\nthe re-election and election, Lee converged towards Washington. Be\r\nthe people on their guard and warned!\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--The publication of this book has occurred at a culminating\r\n     period of annoyances and inconveniences which may possibly have\r\n     left traces in the volume now finished. The Author's residence in\r\n     Washington--unprecedented delays of the mails--scarcity of\r\n     compositors--and beyond all, the confusion from unavoidable\r\n     duplication of proofs, have so annoyed the Author, that it is but\r\n     just to make this brief explanation and apology.",
