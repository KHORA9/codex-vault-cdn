Chapter 1 tells how to reach\r\nsome good people who let their electronic addresses go on the Web site\r\nfor this book.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases—most notably “Sue” and “Greg” in Chapter 7—I’ve guarded\r\nmy subjects’ privacy with aliases and changes of identifying details.\r\nAsterisks show up after the first occurrences of their revised names.\r\n\r\nPlease note, too, that I’ve smoothed out people’s informal online prose\r\nto accommodate the printed page. A “smiley” on the Net is a good quick\r\nway to show a smile or frown; but I couldn’t think of anything uglier in\r\nprint than a series of symbols such as :-). So even in quotes, I’ve used\r\nthem sparingly.\r\n\r\nI wish Mark Twain were alive and cruising the Internet at 28.8 kilobits\r\nper second; I’d love to see how he’d have handled net.dialect.\r\n\r\n                                                  David Rothman,\r\n                                                  rothman@clark.net\r\n                                                  Alexandria, Virginia\r\n\r\n                            Acknowledgments\r\n\r\nAlison, step to the front! Alison Andrukow, a graduate student at\r\nQueen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, served as my chief researcher\r\non this project—discovering a number of goodies ranging from Bianca’s\r\nSmut Shack to arcane, Net-related policy studies.\r\n\r\nJennifer Basye Sander, my editor at Prima Publishing, working with\r\nassociate acquisitions editor Alice Anderson and the project editor,\r\nSteven Martin, provided many suggestions, as did the publisher, Ben\r\nDominitz. The latter promoted this book, so to speak, from _Digital\r\nAmerica_ to _Digital World_, and in time the title _NetWorld!_ also came\r\nfrom Ben. Surprise, you guys! You thought you were getting a general\r\nbook on computer technology, but wisely you let me get caught up in the\r\nNet. _Thanks!_\r\n\r\nBill Adler and Lisa Swayne of Adler and Robin Books, joined by Nick\r\nAnis, agented this book. Nancy Daisywheel Breckenridge was the\r\ntranscriptionist.\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to thank the many people who gave their time by way of\r\ne-mail or otherwise. Lest I forget some important ones here, I won’t\r\nlist any names. But by way of the references in the book itself, readers\r\nwill learn the identities of many.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER\r\n                                  ONE\r\n\r\n    The Terrain\r\n\r\n\r\nA color photo lights up my computer screen when I hit the return key,\r\nand, in big, bold Times Roman letters, I see the latest from the\r\nInternet:\r\n\r\n  _Playboy Is Traveling the Info Highway\r\n  Looking for Women for a Special\r\n  “Girls of the Net” Pictorial_\r\n\r\nSitting atop a pile of books, a most ungeekish model looks flawlessly\r\nnubile, as if part of a virtual reality tableau conjured up for Hugh\r\nHefner himself. _Playboy’s_ message is clear: What counts isn’t mastery\r\nof Telnet, Gopher, Lynx, or other Net voodoo. Candidates should mail or\r\ne-mail “a recent full-length body photo in a two-piece bathing suit or\r\nless and a clear face shot.”\r\n\r\nThe same day a famous hacker named Cliff Stoll goes on a Washington\r\nradio station to promote his book _Silicon Snake Oil_, which says the\r\nInternet steals too much time from true learning and life.\r\n\r\nFor better or worse—mostly better in my opinion, egalitarian that I\r\nam—the Internet has Arrived.\r\n\r\nA quarter-century ago scientists dreamed up a predecessor of the network\r\nto let computers jabber to each other across the United States, even\r\nafter a nuclear attack. Fearless professors followed with electronic\r\ntalk on topics ranging from biology to poetry.\r\n\r\nNow it’s as if _everyone_ is on the Internet—not just _Playboy_ but\r\n_Penthouse_, some Arizona lawyers who love to inflict junk ads on the\r\ninnocent, a Florida manicurist, Democratic and Republican stalwarts,\r\nthousands of college freshmen, punk teenagers, and elementary schoolers\r\nin London, Singapore, Minnesota, Nova Scotia—you name it. In one way or\r\nother, the Net ties in to smaller networks ranging from local, bulletin\r\nboard-style systems to America Online, CompuServe, Prodigy, Delphi,\r\nGEnie, Bitnet, Bix, eWorld, and MCI Mail.\r\n\r\nFans of David Letterman and Jay Leno, the world’s most famous talk-show\r\nrivals, are even duking it out online. The cyberspace section of\r\n_Newsweek_ regularly lists the hottest attractions of the Internet—for\r\nexample, the best sites on the World Wide Web, the multimedia area where\r\nyou can see pictures and hear sound.\r\n\r\nHollywood is gambling on a movie called _The Net_, and _Time_ and\r\n_Newsweek_ have done several cover stories. Could the _Time_ curse be at\r\nwork here? Is everything else downhill, now that the Net has landed on\r\nThe Cover? Not if you go by the stats. Internet demographers love to\r\nsquabble about the exact number of people on the Internet, but at the\r\nvery least, some 25-30 million can reach it by way of electronic mail;\r\nand in a few years, if the braver prophets are right, hundreds of\r\nmillions may be wired in. For the snobs, of course, the old cachet is\r\ngone. A humor columnist says the Net is like citizens band radio with\r\ntyping.\r\n\r\nIs the Internet, then, about to become a 500,000-channel wasteland? Just\r\nwhat are all these millions _really_ doing on the Net? Some politicians\r\nwould have you think that a disturbing number of Netfolks are busy\r\ncorrupting the morals of minors, and shouldn’t we ban smut from the\r\npublic areas of cyberspace? And if you believe some American security\r\nbureaucrats, the Net might turn out to be a haven for spies and dope\r\ndealers. “Shouldn’t Washington,” they more or less ask, “be able to\r\nsnoop on pervs and subversives who scramble their messages?”\r\n\r\nThe counterrevolution has begun, and I feel grouchy.\r\n\r\nEveryone is trying to reinvent the Internet in his or her own image,\r\neven if, with these changes, the Net would no longer be the Net. What’s\r\nreally pathetic is the ignorance of the would-be meddlers. Censoring the\r\nNet would be about as successful as trying to dam the Pacific. The same\r\ndecentralization that made the Net more nuke-resistant, in the Cold War\r\ndays, makes it harder to control. And how can Washington sell the Net on\r\nFed-friendly chips for coded messages when scores of powerful encryption\r\nproducts are on sale in Russia and the rest of Europe?\r\n\r\nAt the same time, certain writers are now attacking the Internet as Cold\r\nand Heartless, or for other sins; some are even Pulling the Plug, at\r\nleast temporarily, to protect their delicate brains against Information\r\nOverload.\r\n\r\n“Don’t make me go back!” J. C. Hertz recalls telling her editors when\r\nthey wanted her to log back on the Net to wind down a book called\r\n_Surfing the Internet_. “Please, don’t make me go back there.” Stephen\r\nL. Talbott, a computer editor and author of _The Future Does Not\r\nCompute_, proclaims that he “immediately felt very good” when he\r\nUnplugged. Bill Henderson of the Push Cart Press says he’ll publish a\r\nbook with “cries from the heart about what electronics has done to\r\npeople.”[1.1]\r\n\r\nPerhaps a new literary genre is aborning—that of the Snubbites, the new\r\nLuddites[1.2] who feel all Netted Up. The definition might go something\r\nlike this:\r\n\r\n    _Snubbite:—n. One who, partly out of snobbery, partly out of\r\n    boredom, partly out of sheer contrariness, snubs the computer\r\n    technology that could help millions of others._\r\n\r\nA typical Snubbite is upper-middle class and very possibly Ivy League.\r\nSnubbites could afford computer and Internet connections—or more likely\r\nenjoyed them at others’ expense—years before average people were even\r\nallowed on the Net. Often Snubbites live near large libraries or can\r\ncatch up with books easily enough in other ways. Snubbites may have\r\nalready used the Net to help stock up on their quota of friends and\r\nprofessional contacts. Most Snubbites are harmless and even charmingly\r\neccentric; they worry me only when they start confusing their own needs\r\nand non-needs with those of society at large.\r\n\r\nCliff Stoll himself is very much on the Internet (“I still love my\r\nnetworked community”) even now; to this day, I suspect, he truly enjoys\r\nseeing people home-brew their own machines. But in stretches of his book\r\nhe could almost be mistaken for a Snubbite anyway, based on sheer\r\nfervor. “It is an overpromoted, hollow world, devoid of warmth and human\r\nkindness,” Stoll writes of cyberspace, and goes on to say that nets\r\naddress “few social needs or business concerns” and threaten “precious\r\nparts of our society, including schools, libraries, and social\r\ninstitutions.” He complains, “No birds sing.”\r\n\r\nHave I been hallucinating? The Internet isn’t Woodstock, the Vatican, or\r\nan aviary, but it is bringing together people for religion, education,\r\nbusiness, love, and suicide prevention. Just what is Stoll writing\r\nabout? Does the Net have an evil twin? Jews, Moslems, Lutherans, and\r\nCatholics—they are all using the Net to exchange prayers or electronic\r\nnewsletters. Up in Canada an Anglican priest will even take confessions\r\nvia e-mail. I doubt he’d agree with the author of _Snake Oil_.\r\n\r\nNor, I suspect, would the members of Walkers in Darkness. Walkers is a\r\nmailing list for people with chronic depression, and each week more than\r\n300 messages whiz across the Net from Australia to Israel, from South\r\nAfrica to California. I’m not depressed, but someone close to me is, and\r\nshe spends hour after hour with her laptop, gazing at the blue-and-white\r\non the screen, reading scores of messages, keeping up with the gossip\r\nabout people and drugs, wondering what she would do without her Net\r\nconnection. Being depressed is like kayaking or hang gliding: You won’t\r\ndie immediately if you skip the homework, but in a pinch you’ll stand a\r\nmuch better chance if you’ve gone far beyond the basics. Walkers is in\r\nthe grand tradition of the Net. Its members don’t blindingly trust\r\nauthority figures—their own shrinks—and they are reaching out to other\r\npatients and to an online psychiatrist. Tell us, Ivan, some Walkers ask,\r\nis Parnate as good a drug as it’s cracked up to be? What about Nardil?\r\nCan you take it without your body swelling up?\r\n\r\n“Ivan” is a well-credentialed psychopharmacologist in New York City who\r\nhelps out for free. Dr. Ivan Goldberg doesn’t prescribe drugs for people\r\nonline, but he _will_ report his own experiences with them after many\r\nyears of practice. He has a knack for coming up with angles that\r\npatients’ own doctors might miss. After months on Prozac, a man found\r\nhis work slipping. Ivan Goldberg told him of a new way—successful here,\r\nit turns out—to treat the problem.\r\n\r\nGoldberg is online two hours a day “as a way of paying back for the\r\nthirty-plus good years I have had from my work with depressed\r\npeople.”[1.3] After several years on the Net helping virtual support\r\ngroups, he has won the respect of hundreds and perhaps even thousands.\r\n\r\nStill, Walkers compare notes with each other and don’t accept even Ivan\r\nGoldberg’s opinions automatically. Just as if they were talking over the\r\noffice watercooler, they weigh the validity of the information\r\nthemselves. But what a collection of facts! When a new antidepressant\r\nshows up in Canada or the United Kingdom, Walkers learn about it many\r\nweeks before the news reaches the daily papers in the States, assuming\r\nthat word makes their daily newspapers at all.\r\n\r\nMany of the best conversations, however, aren’t about drugs or the\r\nmerits or perils of electroconvulsive shock treatments. They’re about\r\nother Walkers. Remember the gay Walker in Iowa who was so quick to\r\nwelcome newcomers and answer questions? Well, here’s his obit: _Died of\r\ncomplications from diabetes_. How about the fellow on the East Coast,\r\nthe programmer who never logs on with a name? Is he okay, after his last\r\nsuicide attempt? Is somebody going to drop by to visit him in the\r\nhospital? What about such-and-such’s cat? How’s your new girlfriend? Is\r\nyour landlord being reasonable? The questions and answers fly across the\r\nwires. Walkers may not be as famous a virtual community as The WELL,\r\nEcho, and similar bulletin board systems with Net and media connections,\r\nbut it’s hardly as if the luminaries of those places enjoy a monopoly on\r\nCaring.\r\n\r\nLater that morning I hear Cliff Stoll push his book on WAMU radio. It’s\r\na slaughter; the call-ins run against him by at least five to one. I\r\neven feel a little sorry for him until I remember that the technophobes\r\nat many bookstores may outnumber the technophiles. The full title of the\r\nbook is _Silicon Snake Oil: Second Thoughts on the Information Highway_,\r\nand it should be just the ticket for Luddites and Snubbites with spare\r\nchange. I myself have Second Thoughts about his Second Thoughts. Early\r\non in his book he says: “I look forward to the time when our Internet\r\nreaches into every town and trailer park.” But his true emphasis comes\r\nthrough. Just how much of a technopopulist is he in the end when he\r\nclaims that networks will “isolate us from one another” and “work\r\nagainst literacy and creativity?”\r\n\r\nWhat’s really freaky is that a woman from Walkers or a similar\r\ndiscussion group—out of all the thousands on the Net—calls up _The Diane\r\nRehm Show_ and ever so politely shreds the arguments that Stoll has made\r\nin _Oil_. A few years ago he wrote _The Cuckoo’s Egg_, a wonderful book\r\nabout his battles against errant hackers, and parts of _Snake Oil_ do\r\nring true, but oh how wrong he is about the more cosmic issues.\r\nConfronted with the Walkers-style example, Stoll acknowledges that, yes,\r\nmaybe the Net could be of use to people who need support. After all, the\r\nvery anonymity he’s assailed can work in favor of honest dialogue.\r\nExactly. One of the glories of Walkers, however, is that depressed\r\npeople can be as open or nameless as they want. What’s more, they can\r\neven go Face to Face. Several Walkers near me, for example, will spend\r\nhours and hours talking in person with others dogged by this scourge of\r\nLincoln and Churchill.\r\n\r\nDave Harmon is the man behind the Walkers list. He’s a\r\ntwenty-eight-year-old Harvard grad, bearded, bespectacled, and a little\r\non the heavy side, as he describes it. I learn that he works as a\r\nprogrammer for a company that writes software to use with mice—the\r\ncomputer kind. His depression is moderate. Come the middle of the night,\r\nhe may wake up in a cold sweat; he can also suffer flagging energy.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago Harmon was crouched in a Boston bus shelter, enjoying\r\na break from a crowded but rainy New Year’s Eve celebration, when he\r\ntook out a notebook and wrote a poem. “I am the Walker in Darkness,” it\r\nread in part, “I am the bringer of light.” The next day Harmon called\r\nthe company that had hooked him into the Internet—he wanted to start a\r\nlist for depressed people interested in art and magic. “The thing that\r\nmakes the Net so powerful is that you don’t have to get into a big deal\r\nto start a minor newsgroup or a mailing list.” The newsgroups and the\r\nmailing lists can precisely reflect Netfolks’ interests, loves, and\r\nfears—much more closely than, say, CBS or the _New York Times_, or even\r\nniche programs on cable.\r\n\r\nOklahoma City and the\r\nBan-the-Bomb-Manual Panic\r\n\r\nA citation for _The Terrorist’s Handbook_ popped up on my screen a\r\nminute after I started a search of the World Wide Web under the word\r\n“explosives.” I apparently would be able to make “book bombs,”\r\n“lightbulb bombs,” “phone bombs.”\r\n\r\nTrying to retrieve the _Handbook_ some weeks later, I read the\r\nfollowing: “Are you sure this resource exists?” Cute. The heat is on.\r\n_Handbook_-style items caught the attention of the U.S. Senate after\r\nsickos blew up a federal building in Oklahoma City and killed 160\r\npeople. The response in effect was: “Ban the bomb manuals—from the Net\r\nand otherwise!” and as of this writing, it looked as if such sentiments\r\nmight end up as law. Still, a little problem arose in the case of _The\r\nTerrorist’s Handbook_ on the Net. The material was coming to me from\r\nLysator, a respected academic computer society at Linköping University\r\nin Linköping, _Sweden_. Last I knew, the U.S. Senate did not enjoy\r\njurisdiction over its counterparts in Stockholm.\r\n\r\nThe Swedish computer that stored _The Terrorist’s Handbook_, however,\r\ncontains megabyte after megabyte of valuable material on computing and\r\nother subjects, and the electronic librarians didn’t want to anger the\r\nuniversity. So out of prudence, they voluntarily removed the bomb manual\r\nafter hysterical stories appeared in the press. The _Handbook_ wasn’t\r\nworth the fuss.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in other cases Washington will use diplomacy with other\r\ncountries to unplug _Handbook_-style items. But no one should count on\r\nthis approach working in the end. Inevitably the same material will be\r\nsecretly making the rounds of obscure electronic bulletin board systems,\r\nas opposed to the Net itself. As if that isn’t enough, Washington has\r\nunwittingly given out instructions for bomb-makers by way of the\r\ntax-financed _Blaster’s Handbook_ from the Forestry Service in the U.S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture. Even _The Encyclopedia Britannica_ has\r\nprinted material on explosive making.\r\n\r\nMost disturbing of all, Constitutional issues arise here. We don’t need\r\nthe government to restrain free speech. As writer Brock N. Meeks wrote\r\nin his _CyberWire Dispatch_ newsletter, Senator Dianne Feinstein’s\r\nproposal was “a break in the dike.” It was “the trickle that could\r\nbecome a river of regulatory hammers meant to turn the rough-and-tumble,\r\nopen and free-flowing online discourse into something with all the\r\nappeal and intellectual acumen of tofu.”\r\n\r\nNewsgroups are a bit like local bulletin board systems except that some\r\nnewsgroups reach hundreds of thousands of people around the world.\r\nMailing lists are more intimate than newsgroups since you usually need\r\nto sign up for them electronically before you receive the messages.\r\n\r\n“The funny thing,” Harmon says of freshly created mailing lists, “is\r\nthat you never know what will result. What I found was that most\r\ndepressed people couldn’t produce that much art and mysticism, but they\r\nwere interested in supporting each other, and I looked at that and let\r\nit go on its own.”\r\n\r\nA seventy-eight-year-old widow in the American South discovered Harmon’s\r\nlist. She was the first in her family, after several generations of\r\nmental illness, to seek psychiatric help. People from Singapore have\r\npopped up, too, reporting how they were stigmatized as lazy by people\r\nunable to understand the energy-sapping qualities of the disease.\r\nWalkers tell of spouses complaining about the loss of sex drive from\r\ndepression or medications. Simply put, Harmon’s list has not just helped\r\npeople cope with a disease, but it has also helped those who can’t\r\nunderstand it. And as shown by the Singaporean example, geography has\r\nbeen inconsequential for the most part. “When you’re depressed,” Harmon\r\nsays, “it doesn’t matter where you’re from, you’re still depressed.”\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, Walkers can log on as often or seldom as they want.\r\nFrequently the depressed feel all “peopled up,” so they may flee into\r\ntheir rooms and close the blinds when visitors approach. But with\r\nWalkers messages, all they need do is press the delete key. The Internet\r\nisn’t just a medium of special benefit to the deaf; it’s also one for\r\nthe seriously depressed, many of whom, if made Netless, might try to do\r\nwithout _any_ company offline.\r\n\r\nAs with thousands of other Net lists, people come and go, some of them\r\noverwhelmed by the sheer volume of messages; Stoll is right to\r\ncharacterize the Internet as like trying to drink water from a fire\r\nhydrant. But a core of stalwarts remain enthusiastically on Walkers, and\r\nalong with Harmon and Goldberg, they’re rather small-townish in\r\ncyberspace in the best of ways. I ask about the East Coast Walker with\r\nsuicidal tendencies. Harmon says that by the time the supportive\r\nmessages reached the man, the programmer had already called 911 and gone\r\nto the hospital to have his stomach pumped.\r\n\r\nBut, yes, Harmon says, Walkers has indeed saved lives. “A more usual\r\nsituation is that someone is considering suicide and issues an appeal to\r\nWalkers for help. They’ll say something to the effect that ‘It’s not\r\nworth it, and nothing I do ever works, and I’m probably bothering you\r\nwith this note.’ People respond to it and sometime call the person by\r\nphone if the number is available.” If the number isn’t, Harmon and other\r\nNetheads will try to use their knowledge of the Internet to track it\r\ndown. “We don’t breach privacy unless there really is a suicide threat,\r\nand sometimes people’s accounts may be on services where we can’t find\r\nthem. More usually, various people may send their own phone numbers\r\neither privately or to someone or to the list, so that other members can\r\nreach them.\r\n\r\n“The Internet,” he cautions, “is _not_ always a fast-rescuer—you may be\r\nlucky to get same-day service. In the programmer’s case his note didn’t\r\neven get _to_ my list for an hour, much less get sent out to all the\r\nmembers. _I_ found out about his note by getting a midnight phone call!”\r\n\r\nStill, Harmon sees the Net as a godsend for ongoing support and as a\r\ncrisis aid even if the help isn’t always immediate. Goldberg agrees:\r\n“It’s mobilized people to all kinds of interventions.”[1.4]\r\n\r\n“I’m sitting here with a knife in my hand,” wrote a community college\r\nstudent asking for support from Walkers. “Don’t worry, I’m not going to\r\nkill myself—just hurt myself a little. I just feel as though I deserve\r\npain.” She went on to tell how she had been in the National Honor\r\nSociety in high school, gone on to an honors program at Loyola\r\nUniversity for several years, then had been forced to leave. “I used to\r\nbe strong, brilliant, and ambitious and now I am stupid and manic\r\ndepressive. It just hurts so much. So I guess that’s why I’m cutting on\r\nmy wrists tonight.” She told me when I wrote to ask about her\r\ncondition—improved—that “I would be lost without Walkers.”\r\n\r\nA near-suicide in Santa Clara, California, aided by the newsgroup\r\nalt.support.depression, recalls: “I was so close it was amazing.”\r\nMedical debts had overwhelmed him. He was a single father and his boss\r\nhad put him on probation after child care gobbled up too much work time.\r\nIn tears he began his note: “It doesn’t really matter any more.” A New\r\nYork woman saw the note and begged people online to help. Hundreds of\r\nmessages came over the Net from as far as Japan. Tracked down despite\r\nhis unsigned post, the California man received help not only from a\r\ncolleague at work but also from police. “Something snapped,” he recalls,\r\n“and I just realized that there were a lot of people there who\r\ncared.”[1.5]\r\n\r\nMadness, another self-help group on the Net, is a mailing list for\r\npeople who suffer drastic mood swings, hear voices, and see visions.\r\nNow, says Sylvia Caras, who runs the list, they can use the Net to carry\r\non a dialogue with federal mental health officials. The Net offers a\r\nvery _real_ voice for those the world might otherwise ignore.\r\n\r\nI could go on forever about support groups on the Net. Whether you’re\r\nshort or extra tall, anorexic or 300 pounds, a victim of cancer or of\r\nchild abuse, the Internet teems with people wanting to share their\r\nexperiences with you—a task made much easier through the efficiencies of\r\nthe Net, which have brought the cost of electronic mail down so much. I\r\nbristle when I hear people talk about the Internet as worthless unless\r\nbig profits await megaconglomerates. The activities of support groups\r\nand other virtual communities may not show up in any country’s gross\r\ndomestic product, but in the aggregate they’re just as valuable as\r\nanything to emerge from AT&T or Time Warner.\r\n\r\nMay I emphasize that the Net is far, far more than a mental health\r\nclinic? It’s a place, too, for political activists, boaters, golfers,\r\nmotorcyclists, gun owners, gourmets, football fans, baseball\r\nenthusiasts, parents and teachers, writers and readers of many genres,\r\npilots, airline passengers, amateur radio operators, and reggae lovers.\r\nAll have their own niches, which is just what you’d expect with more\r\nthan 12,000 newsgroups.\r\n\r\nWhile the clueless are arguing over whether the Net has value, people\r\nlike John Schwartz already know it does. Recently he wondered about\r\nlyrics by a singer and songwriter named Liz Phair. Just how did they go?\r\nSome of the biggest fun came from his hunt online. He tracked down at\r\nleast five different Web areas—“digital fan magazines”—devoted to Phair.\r\n“Some had photos, some had biographical information, and a couple had\r\nsong lyrics.” And yes, he found the lyrics he wanted, and in their full,\r\nunprintable glory. “Useless? Probably. Satisfying? You bet.” And\r\nSchwartz went on: “Think of all the stuff that you’d find in your public\r\nlibrary if you pulled something off the shelf. A lot of it would be\r\n‘useless’ for your own needs—tons of mediocre fiction, outdated\r\ninformation, and silly things. But would anybody say that it proves that\r\nlibraries are worthless?”[1.6]\r\n\r\nOther Net activities also suggest that _Snake Oil_ is self-descriptive.\r\nA Michigan couple has started a virtual toy store complete with pictures\r\nof their staffers as children and service of the kind you’d expect from\r\nL. L. Bean; their first order came from Brazil (see chapter 2: Business\r\non the Net: From White Rabbit Toys to “Intel Inside”). Out in California\r\ntwo young techies are giving hundreds of young musicians a break through\r\na much-needed project called the Internet Underground Music Archives\r\n(chapter 3: EntertaiNet: A Few Musings on Net.Rock, Leonardo da Vinci\r\nand Bill Gates, Bianca’s Smut Shack, and David Letterman in Cyberspace).\r\nJust throw $100 their way and, for a year, you can post a sample of your\r\nmusic on the Net and perhaps stir up sales of old cassettes and CDs.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that Stoll grouses that the Internet is unedited,\r\nscores of dailies and weeklies are on the Net to one extent or another\r\n(chapter 4: Pulped Wood versus Electrons: Can the Print World Learn to\r\nLove the Net?). So’s _Time_ magazine. Random House, Macmillan, and Time\r\nWarner are there, too, posting samples from various books, and soon\r\npeople at home will be able to send credit card numbers securely over\r\nthe Net and dial up the complete texts of bestsellers and other books.\r\nEven now you just might be reading _NetWorld!_ off a screen rather than\r\nfrom pulped wood.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a digitized cadaver on the Internet may help revolutionize\r\nthe study of anatomy (chapter 5: Wired Knowledge: When They Let a\r\nMurderer Loose on the Internet), and in Canada, leather-jacketed\r\nteenagers are using the Net to develop their reading and writing skills.\r\n\r\nA Mini Jargon Guide\r\n\r\n• Electronic Mail or e-mail. You can use the Net and other networks to\r\n  send messages to your friends in Peoria or Melbourne—anywhere, in\r\n  fact, where Internet connections go, from Alaska to the South Pole. An\r\n  electronic mailbox is just like the physical equivalent. It’s a little\r\n  storage area where your messages pile up for you to retrieve when you\r\n  want.\r\n\r\n• File Transfer Protocol, or FTP. It’s a means to send or receive files\r\n  from one computer to another.\r\n\r\n• Gopher. This program lets you track down information on the Net. The\r\n  word _Gopher_ also alludes to certain Gopher-style collections of\r\n  computer files. Different Gophers connect to each other through items\r\n  on menus. You might start looking at an article on water pollution\r\n  from a computer in Washington, D.C., see a mention of an African\r\n  river, click on that menu choice with your mouse or otherwise select\r\n  it, and end up at a computer in Johannesburg.\r\n\r\n• Internet Relay Chat. It’s like a huge party line except that people\r\n  are typing rather than talking. You can open up private areas, too,\r\n  and reach just one person.\r\n\r\n• Mailing Lists. To be a bit simplistic, they’re just like regular\r\n  electronic mail, except that a number of people share messages, to\r\n  which you can typically respond privately or with the entire list.\r\n  Some lists, however, let only the _moderator_ send out messages. Via\r\n  Usenet, some mailing lists appear as newsgroups.\r\n\r\n• Newsgroups. These are the bulletin board systems of the Net, in\r\n  effect. Almost anyone can post messages there and potentially reach\r\n  hundreds of thousands of people—far more than on most mailing lists,\r\n  since people can read newsgroups without subscribing. The newsgroups\r\n  are part of a service called Usenet, which reaches BBSs around the\r\n  world, not just the Internet. No one owns this anarchy, and I wouldn’t\r\n  want it any other way.\r\n\r\n• Telnet. Without leaving my regular keyboard I can operate a computer\r\n  at Oxford University or the University of California by way of a\r\n  procedure called Telnet. I’m remotely controlling the machines at the\r\n  other end.\r\n\r\n• The World Wide Web. It’s the area of the Net that not only lets you\r\n  read text but also see pictures, hear sounds, and even take in short\r\n  clips from movies. Like Gophers, sites on the World Wide Web connect\r\n  with each other. A program that lets you navigate the Web is known as\r\n  a browser. Among the more popular browsers are Mosaic, Netscape, and\r\n  Lynx (the latter, alas, won’t let you instantly enjoy pictures).\r\n\r\nAlso, the Net, in the opinion of many, is mocking Orwell’s predictions\r\n(chapter 6: Governments and the Net: Making Sure Orwell Was Wrong). Some\r\nserious threats remain—such as the efforts of American bureaucrats to\r\nmake the Net more friendly to snoopy cops—but 1995 is a long way from\r\n_1984_. What’s more, the Internet doesn’t offer just sex.\r\n\r\nLove, too, can thrive. The persistent may indeed find wives and husbands\r\non the Net (chapter 7: The Electronic Matchmaker).\r\n\r\nThis all happens on my Internet—anyway the one I’ll describe here. Let\r\nme offer an inevitable caveat, however: The Net is too vast for one\r\nwriter to cover everything. So I won’t bother with Internet Relay Chat,\r\nwhere you instantly see the other people’s typing. As a temporary\r\nhabitué of these regions, J. C. Hertz started to regard the Internet as\r\n“a Sartrean hell—too many people talking at one time.”[1.7] Yes! Net\r\nchat brings Hemingwayesque accounts from witnesses to Japanese\r\nearthquakes or Russian coups, and I’m happy it’s around for the\r\naficionados, especially net.lovers, who can retreat to their own private\r\nchannels; but I myself favor electronic mail and newsgroups, which I can\r\nread on my own terms without parrying incessantly with dyspeptic\r\nstrangers half a planet removed. I promise, dear readers: I’ll inflict\r\nnary a chat transcript on you.\r\n\r\nCertain omissions, however, really pain me. Given more time, I’d have\r\nloved to cover the growth of the community network movement. For free,\r\nin many cities, you can open up an Internet account and tap into\r\nelectronic libraries all over the world or receive electronic mail. Best\r\nof all, “communets” can bring communities together. The Net is one of\r\nthe big lures to get people online, but once there, they may be able to\r\nfetch the schedule of their local public radio stations, find out about\r\nlocal charities, and talk back electronically to officials of city\r\nhalls.\r\n\r\nWhat’s fascinating is the resemblance between these local nets and the\r\nNet at large. People on both would rather chat with other citizens than\r\nswap e-mail with the politicians or other celebrities. And why not?\r\nCommunets are communities, just as the Net, serving so many interests,\r\nis a _series_ of communities. Alas, Stoll does not appreciate the\r\npossibilities here.\r\n\r\nStoll is an astronomer, not just a hacker, and his makes me feel as if\r\nhe is using a scratchy pair of binoculars to look for life\r\non Mars. Fixated on negatives, he has downplayed even the\r\nobvious: the Net equivalent of Martian mountains. Has Stoll\r\ndropped by alt.music.chapel-hill, or rec.arts.dance, or\r\nalt.christnet.christianlife, or the Dallas Virtual Jewish Community\r\nCenter Home Page, or the American Ireland Fund, or the Voter Education\r\nProject? And how about the thousands of other Web pages in which\r\nindividual Netfolks can share with the world their love of families and\r\npets, or gardening, or , or old Chevies, or whatever else they enjoy, at\r\nor away from their computers? Item by item, those are tiny, almost\r\ninvisible slices of Netlife; but en masse, they rise up as mountains.\r\n\r\nYes, yes, sex _areas_ thrive on the Internet. But it is that way\r\noffline, too; do snack-food stores turn millions each year off Chaucer\r\nor _Playboy_? Of course Chaucer himself could be randy at times, as\r\ncould Shakespeare and Joyce and hundreds of other literary greats—an\r\ninconvenient fact for the American ayatollahs who hope to censor the\r\nNet.\r\n\r\nThe biggest irony here is that the Internet can actually promote Family\r\nValues and strengthen real neighborhoods. As George Gilder and others\r\nhave noted, the new technology can serve people’s exact needs rather\r\nthan just dish out the standard sex and violence so beloved to TV\r\nnetworks. The Net is Example One in my opinion—especially The Barcroft\r\nSchool and Civic League page on the World Wide Web. Several thousand\r\npeople live in the Barcroft area of Arlington, Virginia, near\r\nWashington, D.C. It’s neither a slum nor a glitzy, status-crazed\r\nneighborhood, just a good place to raise the families that the\r\nayatollahs love to extol. An old Methodist church has served as a\r\ncommunity house. Now an electronic equivalent is on the Web, complete\r\nwith a color photo of the church building; people can catch up with\r\nneighborhood news and learn of ice cream socials.\r\n\r\nI’m writing this paragraph just before the Barcroft Fourth of July\r\nparade. The word from the World Wide Web is that Susan O’Hara\r\nChristopher will be the Grand Marshall. People can enjoy Nancy\r\nTankersley’s watercolors of past parades, or “Jim Lande’s famous tree\r\ntrunk sculpture. Games for the kids, no political campaigning, hot dogs\r\nand lemonade, the new Barcroft tee shirts and lots more!” The higher the\r\npercentage of Netfolks among the citizenry, the more Fourth of July\r\nbulletins we’ll see in cyberspace.\r\n\r\nAcross the Potomac in D.C., the Internet is helping to reduce the number\r\nof hookers and drug pushers plying the Blagden Alley neighborhood. If\r\nthe police catch you looking for women or dope, a man named Paul Warren\r\nwill put your name on the World Wide Web. Thanks to his “Crimenet,”\r\nresidents no longer stand as much a chance of finding a hooker at work\r\non the sidewalk a few yards from toddlers in living rooms. Not everyone\r\nwould approve of the privacy implications here, but I myself love what\r\nWarren is doing. Like thousands of small-town newspapers that print the\r\nnames of the arrested, Warren is just spreading around the public\r\nrecord. A notice reminds readers that “Criminal defendants are presumed\r\ninnocent until proven guilty”; and he is willing to post an update for\r\nanyone exonerated. Warren isn’t saying that prostitution should be\r\nillegal everywhere, just that it should not force young families out of\r\nBlagden Alley.\r\n\r\nThat, in fact, is how I feel about net.sex. If a fifth grader\r\nencountered alt.sex.bestiality whenever he or she flicked on a computer,\r\nwhy, yes, I’d join the ayatollahs. But the Net is not like the pre-Web\r\nBlagden Alley or daytime television. You normally don’t find sex on the\r\nNet—at least not the truly kinky type—unless you seek it out. And the\r\ncomputer industry is working on software to reduce the chances of\r\nchildren accidentally running across alt.sex.bestiality. Even now, of\r\ncourse, the language in the average area of the Net is much cleaner than\r\nthe words in the locker room of the typical high school. Trying to ban\r\n“smut” from the Internet would be like shutting down high school\r\nfootball because _some_ sixteen-year-old tackles love to cuss at\r\nteammates and gawk at nude pictures.\r\n\r\nGranted, the Net has problems, and rather serious ones. A Californian\r\nstole 20,000 credit card numbers from Net users; in New York some young\r\nmen met through the Net and figured out ways to order tens of thousands\r\nof dollars in merchandise illegally. Many Netfolks think it’s too risky\r\nto send credit card numbers over the Net itself when ordering\r\nmerchandise; better to use the telephone or fax. What’s more, just as\r\nStoll says, business on the Net is overhyped. Meanwhile the Feds have\r\nreduced subsidies to the Net. Over in Australia there are already\r\nbothersome charges for use according to the amount of material\r\ntransmitted, and people fear that the same could happen in the States.\r\n\r\nJust as frustratingly, the technology isn’t quite there yet. Pictures\r\ncan take centuries to appear on my screen when I fetch material on the\r\nWorld Wide Web. I hook into the Internet by dialing up ClarkNet, a\r\ncompany in a barn south of Baltimore. This is one of the _best_\r\nservices, but a good part of the time, in recent months, I’ve suffered a\r\nbusy signal or worse when I try to dial in. Given the overcrowding of\r\nthe Net, electronic mail takes longer to arrive than it once did. I\r\nbelieve Stoll when he says that in some cases the United States Postal\r\nService will get mail from one place to the other faster than the Net\r\nwill handle e-mail. That’s the exception, but I’m disturbed to see it\r\nhappen even part of the time.\r\n\r\nI lament, too, the lack of commercial books available on the Net for\r\nfree, in the public library tradition. Cliff Stoll is absolutely right\r\nto want better content, and my friend Jim Besser would agree with us.\r\nJim is a journalist avid for new facts; he regrets that so much of the\r\ninformation on the Net is wrong or out of date. Beyond that, his\r\nInternet connection sometimes goes south when he is under a deadline.\r\n\r\nCures for the Internet’s problems, however, are or could be on the way.\r\nTechnology will make the Net safer to use and more reliable—lo and\r\nbehold, the computers in the barn have behaved somewhat better these\r\npast few weeks. Over the long run, too, Netlife will improve. Popular\r\nprograms in some cases, even now, are letting customers send credit card\r\nnumbers online without the hackers intercepting them. Net businesses\r\nwill take off when more people sign on and young hackers get jobs and\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nThe Internet will even survive the reduction of subsidies from\r\nWashington. The price of the technology will just keep going down if\r\npast trends apply, and if the government doesn’t let phone companies\r\ngouge people. Everything is faster and cheaper. Once the experts doubted\r\nthat ordinary phone lines could carry signals at 9.6 kilobits, or 9,600\r\nbits, per second. Today, even if I’m not IBM or the phone company, I can\r\ncruise along at around 28.8 kilobits per second, which is enough to\r\nreceive a book in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nIf Cliff Stoll really wants electronic books, then computer networks can\r\ntransmit them. When, just when, will Washington be brave enough to work\r\ntoward a well-stocked national digital library offering commercial books\r\nfor all; why should we replicate online the “savage inequalities” of our\r\nlibraries and schools?\r\n\r\nNetfolks aren’t the reason why such a library for the Internet is so far\r\noff right now, and why we may well end up with a national digital\r\nbookstore as opposed to a true library offering books at no charge or at\r\nminimal cost. Even technophobic librarians—they exist, even if not in\r\nthe same numbers as before—aren’t the true villains here. _Lobbyists_\r\nare at fault. Bill Clinton’s intellectual property czar, Bruce Lehman,\r\nis himself a former lawyer-lobbyist who acts as if he is still fighting\r\nfor his old copyright clients. Members of his former law firm have\r\ndonated tens of thousands of dollars to influential politicians. And in\r\na five-year period people with corporate or family ties to a legal\r\npublisher, West Publishing in Minnesota, have given more than $738,000\r\nin political contributions, some of which went to members of Congress\r\ninfluential on copyright matters.\r\n\r\nWith less eagerness to please lobbyists pushing for corporate business\r\nplans—rather than for the commonweal—the U.S. government could divert\r\nresources from bureaucracy to knowledge and pay publishers and writers\r\nfairly. How? Suppose Washington would link the national library with a\r\nfocused program to buy hardware that schools and local libraries could\r\nlend out. In effect the Feds would prime the private market by\r\nencouraging mass production and by sending a message about priorities.\r\nSmall, tablet-shaped computers with extra-sharp screens could eventually\r\ngo on sale—much sooner than otherwise—for $99.95 at Kmart. And these\r\nsame machines, although designed for reading electronic books, would be\r\nexcellent for the Net or for filling out easy electronic forms; we could\r\nsave tens of billions in money and time in the private and public\r\nsectors of America’s $6-trillion economy. Needless to say, too, this\r\naffordable hardware could mean more eyes for retail businesses on the\r\nInternet.\r\n\r\nThen high tech wouldn’t pose such a problem to nontechie consumers and\r\nto computerphobic women and minorities. A study out of the Georgia\r\nInstitute of Technology showed that 94 percent of the surveyed users on\r\nthe Web were male and 87 percent were white. With less-threatening\r\nhardware and proper training of the right people, however, schools and\r\nneighborhood libraries could help bring a much wider segment of society\r\non the Net. Cliff Stoll is aware of the possibilities here. He knew two\r\nyears ago of my TeleRead proposal to improve the content of the Net, get\r\nmany more people online, and spread the electronic books around from the\r\nvery start. How much easier it must be for him to eulogize old wooden\r\ncard catalogues and avoid a nasty tangle with lobbyist-cowed politicians\r\nand bureaucrats.\r\n\r\n               =Touring _NetWorld!_ Yourself—Via the Web=\r\n\r\nWebfolk, check out the Internet Underground Music Archive, White Rabbit\r\nToys, electronic magazines, and many of the other Net delights I’ve\r\ndescribed in this book. Just use your Netscape, Mosaic, or other browser\r\nto go to\r\n\r\nhttp://www.webcom.com/~prima/networld.html\r\n\r\nYou’ll find there a list of various Web sites mentioned here in the\r\npulped wood _NetWorld!_—and perhaps some informal updates. You can reach\r\nthe sites immediately. Just click on the hypertext links. People at the\r\nother end may change the links, but I’ve made them as up-to-date as I\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nIf you would like Net addresses of _some_ of the people mentioned in\r\nthis book, go to\r\n\r\nhttp://www.clark.net/rothman/pub/networld.html\r\n\r\nPerhaps you’ll also want to see a detailed electronic version of my\r\nTeleRead proposal for a well-stocked, cost-justified national digital\r\nlibrary. It could let ordinary readers dial up the _entire_ texts of\r\ncopyrighted books from home for free without cheating publishers and\r\nwriters. For more on TeleRead, check out the hyperlinked Net incarnation\r\nof my chapter in a forthcoming book _Scholarly Publishing: The\r\nElectronic Frontier_ (Cambridge, Massachusetts, M.I.T. Press, 1995):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.clark.net/rothman/pub/telhome.html\r\n\r\nBashing technology, of course, is hardly new. In 1854 a writer\r\ncomplained: “We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph\r\nfrom Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing\r\nimportant to communicate.” He said that “We are eager to tunnel under\r\nthe Atlantic and bring the Old World some weeks nearer to the New; but\r\nperchance the first news that will leak through to the broad, flapping\r\nAmerican ear will be that Princess Adelaide has the whooping\r\ncough.”[1.8] Henry David Thoreau was the writer and the words appeared\r\nin _Walden_.\r\n\r\nDoes their source, however, make them less dubious? Hardly. Imagine\r\nAmerica without the telegraph—without an opportunity to forge lucrative\r\ncommercial ties with the Old World, or to strengthen Texas’s ties to\r\nWashington. As it turned out, Texas and the rest of the country had\r\nplenty to say. So did railroad employees talking to each other;\r\ncompanies could more easily use single tracks to handle traffic in both\r\ndirections, knowing that the telegraph was there to handle\r\nscheduling.[1.9] In other fields, such as medicine, the telegraph\r\nundoubtedly hastened progress as well. It also helped friends and\r\nfamilies keep in touch as the country was settled; today the Net does\r\nthe same with people in this era of international travel. Technology,\r\nthen, while ripe with opportunities for abuse, can do far more than\r\nrecruit “Girls of the Net” or spread word of a princess’s whooping\r\ncough.\r\n\r\nIronically, if the Cliff Stolls prevail, and if too many white hats\r\nabandon the nets as “devoid of warmth and human kindness,” then his\r\npredictions _will_ come to pass; the greedy will take over, confident\r\nthat others won’t mind so much.\r\n\r\nTogether with millions of other Netfolks, I’ll remember the Great\r\nSpamming of ’94. Laurence A. Canter and Martha S. Siegel,\r\nhusband-and-wife partners in an Arizona law firm called Canter and\r\nSiegel, wanted to sell their services as immigration experts. So they\r\nsplattered a “Green Card” ad—as if hurling spam against a wall—across\r\nsome 6,000 newsgroups on Usenet. They didn’t care if you preferred to\r\nread about baseball or UNIX; they wanted your eyeballs. The Net seethed.\r\nI myself disliked many of the tactics used against Canter and Siegel—was\r\nit really necessary to threaten death or favor them with a slew of\r\nunsought magazine subscriptions?—but clearly they merited some good,\r\nstrong, healthy loathing. I complained to the American Bar Association,\r\nwhich, at the time, was spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a\r\nPR campaign to upgrade the image of lawyers. You might say that C & S\r\nset the goodwill account back by several million.\r\n\r\nMy big regret is that I lacked more time to raise hell against Canter\r\nand his wife online and in other ways. The glory of the Net, this\r\n_series_ of communities, was and is diversity; here C & S were dumbing\r\nit down to the broadcast model where one program served all. But Canter\r\nand Siegel didn’t give a whit about the Net as it existed, about the\r\noutrage that so many unwilling people were bearing the costs of sending\r\nand storing their unwanted messages, about the fact that Usenet couldn’t\r\nsurvive continued assaults in this vein, about the damage they were\r\ndoing to the various forms of Net culture, a phrase that C & S would\r\nundoubtedly have dismissed as an oxymoron.\r\n\r\nCanter and Siegel later added to the insult with _How to Make a Fortune\r\non the Information Superhighway_, the 1990s equivalent of a guide to\r\nexterminating buffalo.[1.10] The book talked of selling to 30 million\r\npeople, which was malarkey. Some Net demographers challenged the figure\r\nat the time—reality may finally have caught up—but more important, most\r\nof those 30 million could only send and receive electronic mail as\r\nopposed to using services such as the World Wide Web. And just how many\r\npeople wanted to receive junk mail from marketers? Of course C & S might\r\nsuggest mailing lists for the receptive—nothing wrong there—but without\r\naccess to the right Net services, fewer people would know of the lists\r\nin the first place.\r\n\r\nDoes this mean that the Internet should be free of commerce? Quite the\r\nopposite. The challenge is simply to avoid letting the hardsellers\r\noverwhelm the Internet. Countless areas of the Net exist where people\r\nnot only tolerate ads, they _want_ to read them. Besides, the commercial\r\nand noncommercial can build on each other. When I put my TeleRead\r\nproposal on the World Wide Web—that is, my call for a well-stocked\r\nnational digital library with copyrighted books included—I built in\r\nhypertext links[1.11] to Web sites that could be useful. And several\r\njust happened to be commercial. The Minneapolis _Star Tribune_, for\r\nexample, had done a Pulitzer-quality expose of the thousands of dollars\r\nthat West Publishing had doled out in trips for some Supreme Court\r\njustices who passed judgment on copyright matters. Just why should I\r\nhave avoided this superb material when a commercial publication was good\r\nenough to share it with the Net for free?\r\n\r\nElectronic cafes, found in San Francisco, Seattle, London, and Hong\r\nKong, among other locations, are another good example of how the\r\ncommercial and noncommercial can strengthen each other. Cafes with\r\nInternet hookups can even help bridge the gap between Net and life. The\r\nInternet Cafe at 1363 4th Avenue in Prince George, British Columbia,\r\ndoesn’t just offer a coffee bar. Customers of the local Internet\r\nprovider can pick up their e-mail there and wander around the Net, read\r\n“a good, old-fashioned cork bulletin board for community information\r\nexchanges,” learn about local service agencies, watch resident artists\r\nat work, buy crafts from all over the world, and even get advice from a\r\nlocal psychologist, Russ Winterbotham, who just happens to own the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nWhen Stoll writes about an Ontario bookstore with a water garden and\r\nthree cats, it’s easy to appreciate the potential charms of commerce\r\noffline. But clearly the Net itself can spice up a traditional business.\r\nIn London, you can drop by the Cyberia cafe at 39 Whitfield Street and\r\nplunk down £1.50 for a large cappuccino and £2.50 for a half-hour on the\r\nNet. The word is that the cafe has drawn “more media coverage than a\r\nsmall war.” I’m not surprised. Even if prices might be a bit lower by my\r\nstandards, Cyberia is meeting a definite need. Of course Stoll would\r\ncomplain that the customers in the electronic cafes are “surrounded by\r\npeople, yet escaping into conversations with distant strangers.” Isn’t\r\nhe forgetting something, however: The way many Net aficionados love to\r\nmeet the like-minded in person?\r\n\r\nI’m also keen, needless to say, on the pioneering work that thousands of\r\nsmall businesses are doing on the World Wide Web itself—rather than\r\nposting in-your-face ads to nonrelevant newsgroups.\r\n\r\nNo, Web businesses aren’t charities or consumer service organizations.\r\nBut by offering details about their products and services, they are\r\nrespecting our intelligence far more than does the huckstery on\r\ntelevision. You wouldn’t want to buy a new Buick or Volvo if you simply\r\nwent by statistics and photos on the Web. But you just might learn more\r\nabout gas mileage and safety claims than if you relied simply on the\r\nsales rep and brochures in the showroom. The more you shop this way, the\r\nmore you’ll encourage manufacturers to improve their products and\r\nservices rather than just to shell out megabucks on more Super Bowl ads.\r\nNet business, major limitations notwithstanding, is indeed A Good Thing.\r\n\r\nOur first stop in _NetWorld!_, in fact, might well be one of my favorite\r\nstores in cyberspace—White Rabbit Toys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER\r\n                                  TWO\r\n\r\n    Business on the Net:\r\n    From White Rabbit\r\n    Toys to “Intel Inside”\r\n\r\n\r\nBob Lilienfeld worked for Procter & Gamble and the outfit behind the\r\nMuppets, and JoAnn Lilienfeld was a buyer at Bloomingdale’s. Nowadays he\r\nconsults on solid waste and other environmental issues. His wife, a\r\nneatly coifed woman who looks and dresses like an upscale\r\nschoolteacher,[2.1] has started a toy store called White Rabbit Toys in\r\nhonor of the character in _Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland_. Bob enjoys\r\ntechnology. JoAnn herself is no slouch in that area. They are in their\r\nforties now but relish new marketing wrinkles just as much as when they\r\nwere earning their MBAs from Northwestern University.\r\n\r\nSo Bob and JoAnn Lilienfeld have set up shop on the Internet, where, in\r\na surprising but logical way that a mathematician like Lewis Carroll\r\nwould have loved, their respective business ventures mesh.\r\n\r\nWandering through commercial listings on the Web, I discovered the\r\nvirtual White Rabbit just as Christmas shoppers were crowding the\r\ncorporeal White Rabbit up in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Bob was a\r\ntechnohusband par excellence. He designed the toy store online, claimed\r\njust the right address on the World Wide Web (http://www.toystore.com),\r\nwrestled with the technical issues, and helped take orders from\r\ncustomers, the first of whom lived in Brazil. JoAnn would pay Bob in his\r\nfavorite currency: teddy bears. The big question was: Will they make any\r\nmoney at it? I electronically hung around their virtual store and\r\nchatted with Bob on the phone as the season progressed.\r\n\r\nHe and his wife were among the thousands of small business people who\r\nwere trying new marketing paradigms on the Net, where the denizens hated\r\nintrusive huckstery but might take to electronic catalogues.\r\n\r\nCompared to most other business people on the Internet, the Lilienfelds\r\nwere quick studies. You could type an electronic address into your\r\ncomputer and see a White Rabbit logo and a greeting from the toy store\r\nin several languages. Then you clicked your mouse on the proper area of\r\nyour screen and opened up a colorful catalogue with not only blurbs but\r\nalso pictures of tops and puzzles and wooden toy trains of the kind your\r\nparents might have bought for you. Most of White Rabbit’s offerings were\r\nclassics that you would never see at Toys ᴙ Us.\r\n\r\nBob and JoAnn Lilienfeld wanted their business to stand out. Soon their\r\nelectronic forms might let you type in the age of your child,\r\ninformation about his or her interests, your budget, and other\r\nconstraints. You would instantly receive tips on what gifts to buy. Even\r\nnow, you could order online without talking to a human—not as heartless\r\nas it might sound, if you simply valued your time and telephone money.\r\nThe electronic forms could even calculate the postage.\r\n\r\nWhite Rabbit intrigued me, and others felt the same way. Within a few\r\nweeks of my first visit, they got calls from the _Wall Street Journal_\r\nand the _Detroit Free Press_. Some reporters had caught on to the\r\nobvious: While Hollywood and Washington were off prattling clichés about\r\nthe overpriced medium called interactive TV—while Al Gore was cracking\r\njokes on stage with Lily Tomlin during an entertainment summit disguised\r\nas an “information” one—entrepreneurs and Fortune 500 companies were\r\ntrying ads on the Net. The Internet often narrows differences between\r\nlarge and small businesses. Even little ones can reach global audiences\r\nand, through well-planned Web areas, look like giants to customers in\r\nRio or Tokyo. New cybermalls sprout up to get technophobic companies\r\nonline by providing both technical and creative services. Corporations\r\nfight over addresses for the Net. Stanley Kaplan, a service that tutors\r\nstudents for academic examinations such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test,\r\nsued a competitor that stole the name kaplan.com. A writer for _Wired_\r\nmagazine mischievously claimed McDonald’s name, which the hamburger\r\nchain hadn’t yet registered. Such oversights, however, were rapidly\r\nbecoming the exception in an era when prime Web sites made the pages of\r\n_Newsweek_.\r\n\r\nEven electronic hookers (“We go all the way”) were on the Internet—in\r\nfact, operating under the name “Brandy’s Babes.” They plied their trade\r\nfrom Arizona, the same wild and quirky state from which Canter and\r\nSiegel enraged the Net. And yet, if you cast the usual moral questions\r\naside, the Babes seemed to be exemplary citizens of cyberspace. Not just\r\nhypesters, they posted specifics like prices, bust, hip, and waist\r\nmeasurements, and preferences in men. “No beards,” a Babe warned\r\ncustomers. “Employed men only.”\r\n\r\nUnlike the hardsellers, the Babes did not inflict unwanted ads on\r\nthousands of newsgroups. And in line with the two-way traditions of the\r\nNet, they solicited messages from customers—dirty ones that the Babes\r\nmight charge good money to answer. You could even dial up Brandy’s and\r\nsee a live Babe at her computer with her impressive bosom exposed. The\r\ngig lasted several zany months. Fear of police raids grew, however, even\r\nbefore the ayatollahs in the U.S. Senate ranted against net.sex. I\r\nfinally saw just a blank screen except for a laconic message alluding to\r\n“bad links.”\r\n\r\nSeparately a condom store was online as well. It offered medical\r\ninformation, supplied tantalizing odds and ends on such topics as “The\r\nSize of a Man’s Pony,” and wittily answered questions from appreciative\r\nreaders. Like Brandy’s, it operated in a nonintrusive way.\r\n\r\nThe World Wide Web was also a virtual home for thousands of more\r\nconventional businesses such as the manufacturer of a toy gun that shot\r\nPing-Pong balls, a city’s worth of bookstores, Godiva chocolate, and\r\nRagu spaghetti. None other than the Home Shopping Network bought out a\r\nNet retailer specializing in computer equipment. Pizza Hut went online.\r\nAnd the United States was hardly alone in this trend. The Singaporeans\r\nwere competing in the cyberpizza race—Shakey’s Pizza was girding to take\r\norders, via a fax-Net link, from hungry scientists and students at the\r\nNational University of Singapore. A large Irish bank advertised on the\r\nNet. So did the Royal Bank of Canada. It mounted a bilingual Web area\r\nfor both English- and French-speaking customers who, once past the first\r\nmenu, didn’t have to clutter their screens with material in the wrong\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nSome of the old technical barriers, of course, remained even in rich\r\ncountries: most hardware was still rotten for doing home shopping. What\r\nthe customers needed, and what Silicon Valley could not yet provide,\r\nhappened to be small, affordable, sharp-screened computers that could\r\ncolorfully show off the merchandise. The main way to look at the Net was\r\nthrough Mosaic-style programs. And even at 28.8 kilobits per second—the\r\nhighest speed possible through widely available modems—it took too long\r\nto go from page to page of electronic catalogues. The biggest problem\r\nwas the software installation, which could be tricky. Although software\r\nsuch as Internet in a Box simplified the matters, the Net was not yet\r\nTV-easy to use.\r\n\r\nEven so, some companies were designing inexpensive gadgets, which could\r\nsell for mere hundreds of dollars, that would allow people to surf the\r\nInternet on their televisions. I hated the idea of anyone reading text\r\noff a blurry television screen. But at least the powers of the computer\r\nworld were finally thinking of the Internet as a real, live marketplace.\r\nJust as important, Prodigy, America Online, CompuServe, and rivals were\r\npreparing to let customers reach Web sites from their proprietary\r\nnetworks.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft was planning point-and-click Internet capabilities for its\r\nWindows 95 operating system. And it had bought stock in a key Internet\r\nprovider and would be linking its own network tightly with the Net.\r\n_Advertising Age_ estimated the number of people able to access the Web\r\nitself—the best place for Net advertising—at several million at the\r\nstart of 1995.[2.2] And that number might push past 11 million by 1998,\r\naccording to a report from a Massachusetts research firm.[2.3] So, even\r\nif Internet merchants aren’t advertising in the most consumer-oriented\r\nof places right now, they might well be awash in new business later on.\r\n\r\nThe existing denizens of the Internet were more technical than the\r\npeople on, say, Prodigy or America Online. Some software companies used\r\nthis to their great advantage. A good example was Cyberspace Development\r\nCompany, which had created an extraordinarily useful program called The\r\nInternet Adapter, or TIA. Most Net people couldn’t enjoy Mosaic-style\r\nviewers because their network connections did not allow this. But TIA\r\nlet even Netfolks with $18-a-month accounts use Mosaic and other\r\nmarvels. And to buy TIA, they did not have to go to a retail store.\r\n\r\nIf technically savvy, they could pick it up on the Internet itself. A\r\ndigital key, transmitted via e-mail, allowed only authorized customers\r\nto use the publicly available files. Skeptics could try a test version\r\nof TIA for a few weeks before paying for it by check or credit card.\r\nBecause of the low cost of distribution and, in my case, the lack of\r\nneed for full consulting services, I spent just $25 on a product that\r\nmight have cost a good $50-$75 if sold at the usual store. And by\r\nnormally using a basic hookup with my Web software—as opposed to a\r\ndeluxe, time-sensitive one—I could save hundreds of dollars a year.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of the Internet, for the Cyberspace Development Company and\r\nme, didn’t stop there. Via discussion groups, TIA sellers kept us\r\ncustomers up to date, and just as important, we could share tips among\r\nourselves. We could also use the World Wide Web to catch up with long\r\ndocuments; in fact, updated versions of TIA could travel to us over the\r\nNet. All of this, including the elimination of the need to go to the\r\nstore, was taking place on commercial networks such as CompuServe. But\r\nthe costs would have been greater for Cyberspace and customers alike if\r\nthe company had to pay the usual commercial rates for electronic mail.\r\n\r\nAmong the wares talked up online were upbeat prognostications about the\r\nNet itself. For $3,500 you could buy a report from a California\r\nconsulting firm that said annual commerce on the Net and commercials\r\nservices such as CompuServe would reach $600 billion by the turn of the\r\ncentury. I was skeptical. Merchants like JoAnn Lilienfeld would have to\r\nsell warehouse after warehouse of stuffed animals or toys or whatever\r\nthe offerings were. In fact, $600 billion was a good 8 percent of\r\ninternational commerce. On reflection, however, the estimate from Killen\r\n& Associates seemed possible. Through the Net you might find a buyer for\r\nshipload of scrap iron or an office building, not just a stray teddy\r\nbear in need of a child. I phoned Mary Cronin of Boston College, who had\r\nwritten a well-regarded book called _Doing Business on the Internet_. It\r\nteemed with examples from Digital Equipment Corporation and IBM and many\r\nother computer-oriented firms. And she had researched it before most\r\nbusiness people grasped the importance of the Internet. Yes, she said,\r\nthe $600 billion figure sounded credible if you counted\r\nbusiness-to-business transactions.\r\n\r\nDaniel Dern, an Internet consultant, had his own opinion on the\r\nstatistics. He said the Net was like the highway. Just what did you\r\ncount—all the goods that went over the road? The combined salaries of\r\nthe people on the way to work? I could see his point.\r\n\r\nWhatever the exact numbers, the demographics and technology might be on\r\nthe side of the many retail businesses if they stuck it out on the Net\r\nand kept expectations realistic. Scads of people in Generation Net were\r\nabout to marry. They would buy houses and cars and whatever else\r\nmattered beyond stereos and Internet-optimized computers. Just in the\r\nlate summer and fall of 1994, the number of Net-related businesses on\r\nthe Web had doubled, and a good many of the newcomers were not\r\ntechnical. Could the Net really, then, enrich business people without\r\ntechnical backgrounds? Was there indeed money in what had once been the\r\nprovince of cash-strapped college students and dreamy researchers?\r\n\r\nPlenty of people thought that the answer lay in the case history of\r\nGrant’s Flowers, which, like White Rabbit Toys, operated out of Ann\r\nArbor, Michigan. Larry Grant had been a cover boy in an enticing article\r\non the front page of the business section of the _New York Times_; the\r\nInternet pulsed with chatter about the electronic coups that he\r\nsupposedly had achieved for just $28 a month. Excited Netfolks reported\r\nthat he did not even have to type to his customers on the Internet; new\r\norders just poured in on a fax machine with a Net connection. The\r\nCalifornia gold rush was almost a century and a half old. And yet,\r\nwatching the Grant legend take off, I might as well have been among the\r\nboots and beards at Sutter’s Mill.\r\n\r\nSo I talked not only to the Lilienfelds but to Larry Grant, the\r\nlegendary florist himself. Many in the media were still enchanted with\r\nthe Electronic Frontier metaphor, and I remembered the old films about\r\nDavy Crockett, the Tennessee frontiersman who loved corny jokes,\r\nbear-wrestling tales, coonskin hats, and Crockett-friendly news\r\naccounts—the grist for Walt Disney later on. What was next, a movie epic\r\nwith a musical tribute to “Larry Grant, king of the Net frontier”?\r\n\r\nA market might indeed be ballooning for cyber-retailers, as the\r\nhypesters said. But I still wondered about the present. What counted was\r\nnot all the puffery about 30 million Netfolks, many of whom can only\r\nread electronic mail as opposed to _seeing_ roses or toy tops or other\r\nmerchandise. No, the real determinant was how often people dial up your\r\nparticular site and bought. One well-crafted Web area, which advertised\r\ntechnically related goods, enjoyed just a handful of visits in six\r\nmonths without a single sale. This was an issue aside from the total\r\namount of business done on the Net. Having talked with Mary Cronin and\r\nothers, I hadn’t any doubt about those giant commodity transactions and\r\nall the use of the Net by Big Business to automate the paperwork of\r\ncommerce. But what about the small fry? Was the excitement about Grant\r\ntruly justified? I’ll answer those questions in the pages ahead, where\r\nI’ll return to the Lilienfelds and to Grant, and where I’ll examine the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n• MCI, the phone company. It has provided thousands of miles of Net\r\n  connections and now rents out electronic storefronts on the Net. MCI\r\n  offers one of the slickest Web areas—complete with a fictitious\r\n  publishing house (now evolving into a real one) that accepts\r\n  manuscripts from real readers. _Advertising Age_ has hailed the MCI\r\n  site as “unquestionably the best Internet marketing effort to date.”\r\n  Frustratingly, however, while preparing to dispense advice on\r\n  cyberspace, MCI in early 1995 was committing some of the very mistakes\r\n  it should be telling its customers to avoid.\r\n\r\n• Federal Express, whose Internet presence shows the potential of the\r\n  Net for business-to-business transactions, not just the consumer\r\n  variety. Ironically the people at FedEx in some ways were\r\n  demonstrating more Net savvy than MCI was at the time, even though the\r\n  Internet was more in the territory of the latter. The old values of\r\n  customer service still reigned above all else. A smaller competitor of\r\n  Federal Express, a shipper called Right-O-Way, was also making\r\n  outstanding use of the Net. In some ways it was even staying ahead of\r\n  the big boys.\r\n\r\n• Intel, the chipmaker, which learned the hard way how good the Internet\r\n  was for spreading news of flaws in products. The Net abounds with\r\n  skeptical academics and consumerists with _fast_ typing fingers.\r\n\r\n• Other hazards of the Internet for business people. What if you set up\r\n  an electronic storefront like the Lilienfelds’ and then a manufacturer\r\n  decided to cut out the middle people and sell on the Net directly or\r\n  through a larger outlet? Security is another threat. While I was\r\n  writing _NetWorld!_, most commercial areas on the Net lacked a way to\r\n  protect credit card numbers. Hackers broke into General Electric’s Web\r\n  area and stole corporate secrets. Another risk is competitors looking\r\n  over price lists and assessing the strengths and weaknesses of\r\n  products.\r\n\r\nThose caveats will end the chapter. By far, the Internet is a positive\r\nrather than a negative factor for business and customers alike. Wired\r\nconsumers will reward good companies, punish the losers, and spur the\r\nwinners to do still better.\r\n\r\nBob and JoAnn Lilienfeld: The Net as a\r\nWay to Promote Small Businesses\r\n\r\nThousands of miles to the south of Ann Arbor, home of White Rabbit Toys,\r\nLuciana Gores was reading a popular mailing list called Net Happenings.\r\nIt was a kind of town crier. Each day from North Dakota a man named\r\nGleason Sackman sent out informative posts on the many new services that\r\nwere springing up on the Internet.\r\n\r\nGores worked as a network expert, and she was already used to buying\r\ntechnical books through the Internet, which offered a far greater\r\nvariety than what she would find in her own city, Rio de Janeiro,\r\nBrazil.\r\n\r\nShe was also the mother of a seven-year-old named Lucas. So when the\r\nmailing list told her of White Rabbit, she checked it out on the Web.\r\n\r\nPeople who visited the virtual store, or at least those with the right\r\nequipment, saw a logo with the rabbit from Lewis Caroll’s imagination.\r\nThey also conjured up a color picture of a real toy store with shelf\r\nafter shelf of tot pleasers, a tiny table and stool on the floor, and a\r\nlook of friendly chaos—in short, a shopper’s delight for children and\r\nparents alike, which in fact the “real” White Rabbit was. The\r\ntraditional store, the one at 2611 Plymouth Road, had thrived. Now Bob\r\nand JoAnn Lilienfeld were trying to woo virtual customers such as\r\nLuciana Gores. Their electronic White Rabbit just may have been the\r\nfirst full-service toy store—as opposed to one-product billboards or\r\nspecialty shops—to open up on the Internet.\r\n\r\nAn ad on the opening screen helped set the tone for Luciana Gores and\r\nother customers of White Rabbit: “We specialize in high-quality toys\r\nthat help children to create, learn, imagine, and explore. Our toys come\r\nfrom all over the world. We offer such international favorites as Brio\r\n(Sweden), Ravensburger (Germany), Primetime Playthings and Creativity\r\nfor Kids (United States).”\r\n\r\nSuitably equipped customers could actually see pictures of the toys,\r\nincluding a Ravensburger game called the A-maze-ing Labyrinth. “Travel\r\nthe corridors of the enchanted labyrinth in search of treasures,” read\r\nthe carnival-like pitch. “But watch out! The walls shift, and the\r\npassages can close, leaving you trapped! For ages eight and older.”\r\nLucas was a year younger, but did it matter if the child was as bright\r\nas his mother, the network expert? “It seems to be an interesting game,”\r\nLuciana Gores e-mailed me, “and it won a Parent’s Choice award.” And so\r\nshe paid her $24.95 and shipping, which, given the light weight of the\r\ntoy, was modest.\r\n\r\nThanks to the Internet, the Lilienfelds suddenly had the whole world as\r\na market, not just customers living near by. The fact that White Rabbit\r\nwas in a university town, with graduates all over the planet, could only\r\nhelp. So could the fact that the Internet was expanding overseas even\r\nmore rapidly than in the United States.\r\n\r\nWhite Rabbit also appealed to Stuart Lowry, another promising kind of\r\ncustomer—the computer jock turned family man. A Maryland resident in his\r\nlate twenties, he wouldn’t have made the pulses of marketers quicken\r\nseveral years ago; he was a grad student then at Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity and, like many people on the Internet, had more time than\r\nmoney. But that had changed. Lowry now worked at Computer Science\r\nCorporation, a large defense contractor, pulling down a salary in the\r\nmid-forties. He was married and lived in a townhouse, and four months\r\nago his wife had given birth to a baby boy. And so, when Lowry was\r\ncruising the Internet from work and spotted a notice announcing White\r\nRabbit Toys, he favored it with a virtual visit. He ordered a colorful\r\ntoy top for $13, the Floor Spinner from Primetime Playthings.\r\n\r\nMany people on the Web were young males more interested in pizza or\r\ncondoms than in baby toys, but the Lilienfelds were looking ahead a few\r\nyears when the same Net people would be parents. “It’s an act of faith,”\r\nBob Lilienfeld said. “Today’s demographics and selling a lot of toys on\r\nthe Net may be out of synch. But today’s college students are tomorrow’s\r\nparents. Tomorrow’s parents aren’t going to consider ordering by\r\ncomputer any different from getting in a car and going to the shopping\r\ncenter.”\r\n\r\nOther trends might work in the Lilienfelds’ favor. More and more\r\nAmericans were time-short, with long commutes; Stuart Lowry himself\r\nspent forty-five minutes each way, and that actually was a quick trip\r\ncompared to those in cities such as Los Angeles. In northern Virginia I\r\nknew of parents rising at 4 A.M. to go to jobs in Washington some forty\r\nmiles away, and not a few of them were high-tech workers who would\r\nsooner or later end up on the Internet.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached Bob and Jo Ann Lilienfeld in the middle of November,\r\nWhite Rabbit itself had been on the Net maybe a week and had enjoyed\r\naround 1,000 virtual visits in that time. They were hoping that these\r\nnumbers would multiply as Christmas neared. It was too soon to tell how\r\nmany of these people would actually order. Back in June, though, the\r\nLilienfelds had grown excited after reading about Larry Grant in the\r\n_New York Times_ and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n“I saw this figure of 20 million Net users,” Jo Ann said of the numbers\r\ndu jour, “and thought there’s definitely an opportunity here. But I\r\ndidn’t want to go about it in a half-baked manner. I thought there had\r\nto be someone who could combine knowledge of the Net with marketing\r\nexperience.” She checked out a local cybermall and found it wanting in\r\nthe latter area.\r\n\r\nThat wasn’t surprising, given Jo Ann’s perfectionism and eagerness to\r\navoid easy but far-from-satisfactory solutions—whether in retail or life\r\nin general. She had grown up in a cash-short household where, more often\r\nthan not, the children would get out the oatmeal cartons and\r\nconstruction paper and scissors and cobble together their own toys. And\r\nthe same creativity had carried over to her Bloomies days as one of the\r\nresident experts on Christmas tree trimmings. According to the\r\nLilienfelds, it was JoAnn who came up with the idea of selling leafless,\r\nwhite branches. She and Bob had moved to Ann Arbor because he kept\r\nflying off to the Midwest to consult for clients in Midland, and they\r\nfelt that married people needed to spend more time together. JoAnn went\r\nabout establishing the White Rabbit just as conscientiously.\r\n\r\nNot finding the right toys for her own children, she studied the\r\ndemographics of Ann Arbor to verify that a toy store could thrive there.\r\nShe concluded that in a university community, many would love those\r\nwooden train sets and other classic toys as opposed to the trendier\r\nofferings that were touted on television and sold at Toys ᴙ Us. Ann\r\nArbor responded well. A local paper told how she blessed her store with\r\na public bathroom—how she kept diapers and spare wipes around for the\r\nparents of children and emergencies. No need for toilets existed on the\r\nInternet. But even at this early stage, having read up on the Netfolks,\r\nshe was attuned to the need to adapt to the culture of cyberspace.\r\n\r\nJoAnn finally decided that her best savior, the requisite miracle-worker\r\nwith both Net and marketing experience, lived right there in the\r\nLilienfeld household. Those past few months her husband had been\r\nsucceeding off a mix of garbage and the Internet.\r\n\r\nTo be exact, Bob Lilienfeld was advising clients about _future_ garbage,\r\nthe packing materials for consumer products, a major contributor to\r\nlandfills. He hadn’t anything against recycling. But thanks to his work\r\nat Procter & Gamble, he had concluded that the best way to cope with\r\nwaste was to design packages to avoid it in the first place.\r\nManufacturers and customers alike would win. Bob would go on to help put\r\ntogether a network of likeminded consultants, including William Rathje,\r\na world-famous garbage expert at the University of Arizona who had\r\nco-authored _Rubbish! The Archaeology of Garbage_. Lilienfeld met Rathje\r\nat a press conference but also found himself relying on another source\r\nof contacts, the Internet. Again and again he had heard about the Net\r\nfrom professors at the University of Michigan, and he soon was in touch\r\nwith other garbage mavens around the planet.\r\n\r\n“I started sucking in information,” he recalled. “I found out about\r\nmailing lists and newsgroups, and then I decided I would put my\r\nnewsletter up on the Net and see what happened.” The newsletter was a\r\nway to let clients know about his consulting company, the Cygnus Group.\r\nIt helped Fortune 500 companies, other businesses, trade associations,\r\neducational groups, and others grow more sensitive to environmental\r\nconcerns in activities ranging from packaging to marketing.\r\n\r\nJust as JoAnn was careful to befriend Ann Arbor in the right way, Bob\r\ntried to honor the conventions of the Net—avoiding hucksterism in favor\r\nof helpful information. The announcements about the newsletter were\r\nlow-key, and response was good. Soon he was sharing his articles with\r\nhundreds of Netfolks who asked such questions as: “I recently saw an\r\narticle on compact fluorescent light bulbs in _Consumer Reports_. Why\r\naren’t more stores and utilities selling them?”\r\n\r\nAn “Ask Bill and Bob” column, cowritten with William Rathje, revealed\r\nthat such lights “take at least eight times more energy to produce than\r\nold-fashioned bulbs. And they’re heavier, so they use more energy during\r\nshipping.” The column also told of an experiment that McDonald’s was\r\nconducting in Albany, New York, with food and paper composting, saving\r\nperhaps 500-700 pounds per week of solid waste. Readers could learn,\r\ntoo, that a nut seller was moving from glass and plastic bottles to\r\nvacuum bags.\r\n\r\nBob Lilienfeld was hardly an eco-activist by the standards of, say,\r\nGreenpeace; Dow Chemical was among his prime clients, after all. But he\r\nwas serving up information for people with many different viewpoints,\r\nand by way of the proper clicks with your mouse, you could travel from\r\nhis Web site to areas of the Internet such as the Envirolink Network, or\r\nEcoGopher, or EcoNet.\r\n\r\nHis newsletter, known as _The ULS Report_ (short for “use less stuff”),\r\ncarried an item about CD-ROM disks. It described them as “an\r\nenvironmentally friendly way to reduce waste and save resources. One\r\nCD-ROM, including packaging, weighs under half a pound. The 22 books\r\nthat it replaces weigh 70 pounds.” Knowingly or not, he was helping to\r\npave the way for the virtual White Rabbit—where the same principles\r\napplied. Via the Internet, White Rabbit could advertise to thousands\r\nwithout printing up catalogues for them. Oh, they might request\r\ncatalogues later, but then they would have prequalified themselves,\r\nreducing the solid waste. Lewis Carroll would have approved of the\r\nreasoning here. What’s more, unlike paper catalogues, Lilienfeld could\r\nupdate his electronic catalogue to change prices or play up the\r\nfastest-selling merchandise.\r\n\r\nThe World Wide Web was the main way to put White Rabbit on the Internet.\r\nOnce merchants on the Net would have favored a service called Gopher (as\r\nin “go-fer-it”) in honor of the mascot at the University of Minnesota.\r\nGopher displayed text very well and needed less bandwidth on the Net\r\nthan the Web did. But it lacked the pizzazz of the Web-Mosaic\r\ncombination; that is, the ability to conjure up pictures and even sound\r\nso easily. Although Bob used Gopher for digging up scholarly works about\r\nthe environment, it was like black-and-white television while Web-Mosaic\r\nwas color and all the more alluring for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nGetting White Rabbit on the Web was surprisingly cheap in some ways. The\r\nLilienfelds’ network provider charged JoAnn just $50 a month, plus $2 an\r\nhour for when she was using electronic mail or handling other chores.\r\nThat didn’t include Bob’s time, however. He knew at least the basics of\r\nthe necessary programming language and didn’t require the services of a\r\nconsultant to the extent that others might have.\r\n\r\nNet.business, 3D-Style\r\n\r\nYou can’t _touch_ merchandise on the World Wide Web. But the next best\r\nthing may be in store.\r\n\r\nVirtual reality will let you “walk” through Web businesses and see\r\nmerchandise in greater detail as you get “closer” to the object on your\r\nscreen. You can vary the angles, too. So you could use your mouse to\r\ntour a parking lot of automobiles. You could spot the Volvo or the\r\nSaturn of your dreams, and admire not only the outside but also the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nNo, the Web will never replace actual shopping in most cases, but\r\nvirtual reality will be increasingly good at helping you screen\r\npreliminary choices.\r\n\r\nKeep an eye out, then, for WebSpace—the new 3D viewer from Silicon\r\nGraphics, the California company whose technology helped create many of\r\nthe special effects in _Jurassic Park_. WebSpace will work as an add-on\r\nwith popular Web browsers such as Netscape and Spyglass Enhanced Mosaic.\r\n\r\nWebSpace-style technology, needless to say, is far too good to waste on\r\nshopping alone. Virtual reality software for the Web may also help you\r\ntour the National Gallery of Art, the Library of Congress, or Mount\r\nKilimanjaro—not to mention Hong Kong or Rio de Janeiro.\r\n\r\n3D technology could revolutionize the financial world. Small investors,\r\nnot just high-powered stock analysts, could “see” stock market trends.\r\nYour screen might display a “Bulls’ Corner” with a collection of\r\ncorporate logos color-coded according to the improvement in the stock\r\nprice. You could open up the logos and go on a tour of various\r\ndivisions, wandering around them electronically with far more ease than\r\nyou could with less advanced software.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, at the suggestion of your broker, you could tour a Bear’s\r\nCorner and see why you might avoid or sell off certain shares.\r\n\r\nMind you, there are negatives. Corporations—whether stores selling\r\nmerchandise or companies seeking investors—may use this slick technology\r\nto fool the public. On the other hand, the Internet is already a godsend\r\nfor consumers and small investors. Via Usenet newsgroups and mailing\r\nlists, they can swap information, taking care of course to look for\r\nplants from companies trying to sway grassroots impressions.\r\n\r\nLilienfeld himself put in most of the set-up hours. It took him a few\r\ndays of programming to design the Web site and scan in the pictures of\r\nmore than two dozen items—the train sets, the puzzles, the tops, the\r\nblocks—and like an old-fashioned art director he had to create within\r\nthe limits of the medium. The big problem was photos. If they were too\r\nbig to move over the Net quickly, then the peeved readers might give up\r\nand go on to another Web site. If too small, however, the pictures would\r\nlack enough detail to show off the store or the merchandise. In many\r\ncases Bob would let readers click on pictures of bears to see larger\r\nversions of the photos.\r\n\r\nHe also had to worry about the software the readers used on the\r\nInternet—certain Mosaic-style browsers would show _smaller_ objects\r\nfirst. Other challenges arose. What if technical standards changed so\r\nthat only certain browsers would work with Bob’s site? The real White\r\nRabbit might be a victim of acts of God such as the ebb and flow of\r\nautomobile traffic, and the virtual Rabbit needed to worry about\r\npatterns of Net traffic, but it also could be subject to Jehovah in the\r\nform of macho software firms who wanted everyone on the Net to use their\r\nbrainchildren.\r\n\r\nCompanies such as Netscape Communications Corporation actually gave away\r\nMosaic-style products to us Netfolk for free, hoping to make fortunes\r\ninstead off the software that merchants and others denizens on the Web\r\nwould run. Netscape was the champ in late 1994, the one that let you go\r\nfrom page to page faster than any competitor did. Many people feared\r\nNetscape would be to the Web what Microsoft was to software; suppose\r\nNetscape used technical prowess and marketing skill to trample\r\ncompetitors, and maybe overcharge the customers.\r\n\r\nA green monster named Mozilla came up on one of Netscape’s welcoming\r\nscreens, and pessimists wondered if the company itself might someday\r\nplay the part. Marc Andreessen, the top software designer at Netscape,\r\nhad led the team that came up with the original Mosaic at the University\r\nof Illinois. And then he had left Illinois to join a new company that,\r\nfrom the ground up, had designed the speedier Netscape product. The Web\r\ncommunity mightily hoped that Mozilla and keepers would behave\r\nthemselves. Suppose that Netscape joined Microsoft or credit card\r\ncompanies to build in special, billing-related features that users of\r\nother browsers couldn’t use?\r\n\r\nNetscape, however, seemed benign so far, and the browser’s technical\r\nwizardry was winning many friends. With a click of the mouse, for\r\nexample, you could scoot smoothly from the Web to the usual newsgroups,\r\nand Bob Lilienfeld took advantage of this. He set up his computer system\r\nso that customers with the proper software could whiz directly from\r\nWhite Rabbit to child-related newsgroups.\r\n\r\nOne moment you could be shopping for toys; the next, exchanging tips\r\nwith a New Zealander or Norwegian on how to cope with tantrum-prone\r\nbabies. You could zip to misc.kids (“A great place to swap parenting war\r\nstories”), misc.kids.consumers (“Help with purchasing decisions”), or\r\nmisc.kids.computer (“Enough said!”). Or you or your children could read\r\nodds and ends about wombats, Forester kangaroos, Tasmanian devils, fish,\r\nlions, dinosaurs, and other creatures at WombatNet; print out drawings\r\nof the human heart or the stars or hear a thunderbolt by way of the\r\nFranklin Institute Virtual Science Museum; and learn the population of\r\nUganda or Afghanistan via _The CIA World Factbook_, a guide assembled by\r\nthe real-life Central Intelligence Agency.\r\n\r\nFighting the companies such as AT&T and the big cable interests, many\r\nactivists likened the Internet to a series of communities with\r\nopportunities for small merchants and citizen-to-citizen communications\r\nas opposed to couch potato offerings from the Fortune 500. Merchants\r\nsuch as the Lilienfelds were acting out the very models about which the\r\nactivists waxed so enthusiastically.\r\n\r\nBob Lilienfeld understood that just as storekeepers in a small town\r\nwould do well to join the Kiwanis Club, virtual storefronts should be\r\npart of Net life. JoAnn would soon go to a toy convention, and at some\r\npoint, she might well share her impressions with the denizens of\r\nmisc.kids and similar newsgroups, as opposed simply to touting her\r\nproducts. At the same time, yes, by way of a signature at the bottom of\r\nher posts, people on the Net could find out about the toy store. She\r\nmight even start a mailing list for the receptive. Bob had already shown\r\nthe success of this model by way of the list and other tools used to\r\npromote his consulting activities.\r\n\r\nA toy-oriented list could be much more than ads. “Going shopping isn’t\r\njust spending money,” Lilienfeld observed, “it’s a social phenomenon.\r\nIt’s seeing people you know, it’s being part of a crowd.” And it’s also\r\npicking up gossip and maybe even solid information. “Ultimately the toy\r\nstore will be bigger than just a toy store,” he said. “We might be\r\nproviding information on child development, of the appropriateness of\r\ncertain toys or coloring books. If you’re a model train hobbyist, we\r\nmight be able to help you hook up with model train users groups.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, by way of the mouse-activated links from White Rabbit to\r\nnewsgroups and other Web sites, he was already offering much more than\r\njust a store. The line between merchants and information providers was\r\nblurring in the case of Bob and JoAnn; the higher the quality of the\r\ninformation at White Rabbit, the more it would be a virtual gathering\r\nplace for people on the World Wide Web. I wasn’t surprised to hear some\r\npeople say that librarians might be the star sales reps of the future.\r\nIt wasn’t hype. Information, not just prices and selection of\r\nmerchandise, would be what drew Netfolks to sites such as the\r\nLilienfeldss’ . Of course Bob Lilienfeld might want to be choosy about\r\nwhat links he listed. If he listed too many of the mediocre ones, then\r\nhe would simply be replicating the function of the powerful search\r\nprograms on the Web and adding to people’s “information overload,” to\r\nuse an ever-popular phrase.\r\n\r\nSoftware already let sophisticated Netfolks zero in on items of\r\ninterest. Merely by typing in the word “toys,” for example, I could find\r\nscads of listings—from mentions of adult sex toys to the Web site\r\nadvertising the gun that fired Ping-Pong balls. And these programs would\r\nsoon be simple enough for even technoklutzes to use. So the Lilienfelds\r\nhad better offer something that the software could not supply: Their\r\njudgments about which Web sites, newsgroups, and mailing lists were the\r\nmost fun or most informative.\r\n\r\nAll through the Christmas season, JoAnn kept refining her Net-related\r\nplans. “We need to ask, ‘Have we chosen the right items?’” she said.\r\n“The draw of our toy store is, it’s an exciting place to shop. We have\r\nto do the same on the Internet. If we add more items, it will approach a\r\ncatalogue more. Right now our competition is mail-order catalogues, and\r\nwe have a lot of items that they’re not offering. Maybe we’ll be\r\nreaching people not on the traditional catalogue list. They could be\r\nmore occasional toy buyers than frequent toy buyers.”\r\n\r\nThanks to a computerized inventory system, JoAnn’s corporeal store\r\ncarried more than 6,500 items. Bob made a mental note: He might want to\r\nput more of them on the Net so customers would enjoy a wider selection.\r\nJoAnn talked about her suppliers: “My goal was really getting this up\r\nand going for Christmas. When I get to the toy fair I’ll discuss this\r\nwith the national sales managers and see if I can’t get discounts for\r\nadvertising to so many people, and then we’re working probably toward\r\nnext Christmas. We’ll be working toward fourth quarter of ’95.”\r\n\r\nThat was a healthy attitude. Even toward the end of the season the\r\nnumber of visits didn’t go past 2,000 a week, and only a handful of\r\nactual sales resulted. The only customers were Luciana Gores; Stuart\r\nLowry, the computer jock turned family man; Michael Wolfe, a West\r\nVirginia professor studying Internet commerce, who ordered half a dozen\r\nstuffed toy caterpillars; a second academic, in the Midwest, who bought\r\na Ravensburger Snail’s Pace Race game; a Massachusetts woman sending\r\nthree customizable dolls to her sister (“I’m testing business on the\r\nNet—aren’t you lucky?”); and David Fry, the operator of a cybermall\r\nnearby who was curious about the White Rabbit, and who bought First\r\nBlocks.\r\n\r\nNot that the Lilienfelds had completely wasted their time. As of\r\nChristmas, a _Wall Street Journal_ story hadn’t appeared, but the\r\nDetroit paper and others had gone ahead with articles, and customers\r\npoured onto the floor of the real White Rabbit, one even buying the\r\ngiant polar bear that Bob had been hoping to give his nine-year-old son.\r\nThe publicity may have brought in some $20,000-$25,000 in extra sales by\r\nBob’s estimates, on which the Lilienfelds may have netted around\r\n$2,000—compared to $750 gross and $75 net from Net orders. Bob told me\r\nthat other merchants on the Web were also reporting a low number of\r\nsales. The week before Christmas the number of visits to White Rabbit\r\nitself actually declined; many of the prospective customers had been\r\nlogging on from school or work, and now they had partly emptied the Web\r\nalong with their dorm rooms and offices.\r\n\r\nFrom a get-rich-quick perspective, then, the virtual White Rabbit had\r\nbeen a zero. Bob and JoAnn were smart marketers with MBAs from a Big Ten\r\nbusiness school, and he had a real feel for the Internet, which he had\r\nsuccessfully used to expand his consulting business. But even the\r\nLilienfelds could not score right away. Oh, how tantalizing the\r\ngargantuan numbers had been—the tens of millions of users said to exist;\r\nthe million by which the Net was supposed to be growing each month. And\r\nyet in the end, when the time came for customers to key in the credit\r\ncard numbers, the market had vanished like the Cheshire cat. That didn’t\r\nmean the Lilienfelds were foolish; just a week or two after Christmas, a\r\nwonderful twist happened. The number of visits to the toy store fell\r\noff. But sales leapt up. By mid-January White Rabbit was moving an\r\naverage of a toy a day—not a Kmart volume, but an improvement. Bob\r\nexplained the difference. Now White Rabbit’s first screen told customers\r\nthat the store could often get toys not mentioned online.\r\n\r\nEncouraged, Lilienfeld added yet another improvement, an 800 number. Now\r\ncustomers could ask their questions the old-fashioned way if they\r\npreferred, and they could also order by voice if they didn’t trust the\r\nNet with their credit card numbers.\r\n\r\nWith enough tweaks like this, the virtual toy store might eventually\r\nflourish as the number of Web users grew. Just like the characters in\r\nmany children’s stories, the White Rabbit would keep on changing—adding\r\never-more-intriguing links to newsgroups and other Web sites, putting in\r\nthe software to help novice toy shoppers choose just the right ball or\r\ntrain set, figuring out new ways to use the interplay between the Net\r\nand the traditional media. Sooner or later, the Netheads would\r\nreproduce, and when they went looking for rattles and Lego sets, Bob and\r\nJoAnn would be ready for them. The story of White Rabbit Toys, like that\r\nof the Internet itself, was far from over.\r\n\r\nThe Electronic Billboard: Grant’s Flowers\r\n\r\nLarry Grant just might be doing better at the moment than the\r\nLilienfelds were. He was selling flowers, and what better merchandise\r\nexisted for grad students who were alone at the keyboard in a dark\r\noffice at two o’clock, and who had forgotten their girlfriends’\r\nbirthdays?\r\n\r\nA newsletter publisher named Rosalind Resnick—a former staff reporter\r\nfor the _Miami Herald_ and the author of an Internet business guide—was\r\ngrossing more than $20,000 a year in subscriptions and expecting to do\r\nmuch better in 1995.[2.4] And her media-oriented newsletter helped pave\r\nthe way for a lucrative consulting business. I also knew of a network\r\nexpert named Gordon Cook who was able to jet to a three-week research\r\nexpedition in Moscow at his own expense, and who lived satisfactorily on\r\nthe revenue from _The Cook Report on Internet_ and related\r\nactivities.[2.5]\r\n\r\nGrant’s Flowers, however, was more of a typical business. Larry Grant\r\nwasn’t a writer. And his work was not as network-related as that of\r\nResnick and Cook; unlike the latter, he hadn’t evolved into a\r\nnet.personality on some key mailing lists. Instead the word was that\r\nLarry Grant just paid his $28 a month to an electronic mall—a collection\r\nof stores that shared a common subarea of the Net—and sat back and\r\nwatched his fax machine spew out orders. Grant might not be Davy\r\nCrockett in terms of action, but certainly in terms of fame he was\r\ncoming along. He had appeared as a success story, after all, on the\r\nfront page of the _New York Times_ business section.\r\n\r\nAs I wended my way through the Net to Grant’s Flowers, I passed through\r\nan area called Branch Mall. A logo with a tree branch greeted me. I saw\r\nlistings for enterprises ranging from cosmetic sellers to H & H Logging\r\nand Timber Company. Under “Flowers, Gifts, Foods,” I didn’t see just\r\nGrant’s listing. I saw White Dove Flower and Gift Shop, Flowers on\r\nLexington, Exotic Flowers of Hawaii, Bonsai Boy of New York, and half a\r\ndozen others. Bob Lilienfeld was skeptical about cybermalls, and right\r\nnow I could see why. With all this competition, could Grant’s make money\r\noff the Internet?\r\n\r\nLilienfeld had reminded me that traditional malls and the cyber variety\r\nwere different, and I understood. If I wanted to shop for books, I could\r\nbrave traffic to reach Springfield Mall, a large collection of shops\r\nmaybe ten miles from me in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. Springfield\r\nwould be worth the drive. I could visit four stores right within a\r\nfive-minute walk of each other—Brentano’s, B. Dalton, Walden, and Crown.\r\n\r\nThe Net, however, was also different. I didn’t have to drive anywhere. I\r\ncould just use a powerful search engine such as Lycos, key in\r\n“bookstore,” and watch name after name pop up on my screen. Lycos\r\ndemanded just a little technical savvy. But easier alternatives would\r\ncome along. As if that weren’t enough, Netfolks put together lists of\r\nactivities on the Internet, and often they included commercial\r\ncategories. I’d found White Rabbit not through advertising but through\r\nthe Yahoo list out of Stanford University, on the other side of North\r\nAmerica. Distance just didn’t matter. So could the shopping mall\r\nmetaphor truly work out to the benefit of merchants such as Larry Grant?\r\n\r\nBranch Mall at the very least had set Grant up in style. The opening\r\nscreen was attractive and helpful to buyers, with such basics as:\r\n“Different areas of the country sometimes have different prices or may\r\nbe unable to supply certain flowers. For example, New York City has high\r\nrents and costs of doing business, so flowers are more expensive\r\nthere....” And then below I saw a list of the offerings—for example,\r\n“One dozen boxed long stem roses. A fragrant classic. $49.95 to $99.95.”\r\nIn the virtual version of the White Rabbit toy store you couldn’t rattle\r\nthe toys, and in Branch Mall you couldn’t smell the roses, but like the\r\nLilienfelds, Branch Mall had been generous with pictures of the\r\nmerchandise. I loved some little touches. Branch had given Grant a\r\nreminder service into which you could key your spouse’s birthday or some\r\nother date, before which an e-mail note would be sent to jog you to do\r\nyour duty.\r\n\r\nThe selection was varied. You could order everything from the roses to\r\n“a get well soup cup containing button mums, daisies, mini carnations,\r\nstandard carnations, monte casino, statice, and a package of chicken\r\nsoup. $26.” All in all, I felt that this area was even better laid out\r\nthan White Rabbit Toys, where the opening page, though far, far above\r\naverage, didn’t communicate quite as much information as I’d have liked.\r\nAs with White Rabbit, you could order online by filling out an\r\nelectronic form.\r\n\r\nMissing from the virtual version of Grant’s flower shop, however, were\r\nthe customized links that helped give the White Rabbit Toys its\r\npersonality and made it a true part of the Net. If Larry Grant had been\r\nas at home in cyberspace as Rob Lilienfeld was, he could have added\r\nlinks to love-oriented discussion areas or to poetry—perhaps even the\r\nShakespearean variety.\r\n\r\nBut instead this Web page was serving just as an electronic billboard\r\nwith an ordering mechanism. I didn’t even see a photograph of the store.\r\nWhen the _New York Times_ published a photo of a Mosaic screen, it had\r\nsuperimposed a picture of Grant amid his flowers and dressed in an apron\r\nwith an FTD insignia. Couldn’t a similar photo have adorned his Web\r\narea?\r\n\r\nFor that matter, the store didn’t even offer an electronic mail address,\r\njust a phone number for customers with questions. This isn’t to\r\ncriticize Larry Grant. He was not an honorary techie as Bob Lilienfeld\r\nwas. Like Lilienfeld, however, Grant was an intelligent, diligent\r\nMidwest businessman who saw the Net as an opportunity.\r\n\r\nWild talk _about_ Grant notwithstanding, he wasn’t a braggart—simply a\r\nproud family entrepreneur. I learned that Grant’s Flowers was actually\r\npart of a mini local conglomerate. “We’ve been here since 1947,” he\r\nsaid, “and my folks started farming and selling produce by the side of\r\nthe road off a kitchen table. We’re now a million-dollar business and\r\nhave many facets. We have a flower and gift shop, and the front of the\r\nbuilding is beer and foods. We farm 131 acres.” Two brothers were in the\r\nbusiness, and so was his eighty-year-old mother. “She runs the flower\r\nand gift section, and I run the rest of the retail sales and my brothers\r\ndo all the growing and production. We’ve got two acres of greenhouses\r\ngrowing plants for spring sale or gardeners. It’s a very diversified\r\noperation.”\r\n\r\nGrant clearly wasn’t making a living off the Internet alone, despite a\r\ngood start. “We got online in February just before Valentine’s Day and\r\nwe received forty orders that week. In the first ten days we had over\r\n2,900 look in on our electronic storefront. Then it dropped to one or\r\ntwo orders a day, and then we got to Mother’s Day and had a high of\r\nforty in one day. Currently we’ve increased from one or two to six, in\r\nthat range.”\r\n\r\nWhen I asked what his current Net-related gross would be per year, he\r\nroughly estimated it at perhaps $15,000 or $20,000. That was enough to\r\nmake the Web area well worth his time, but this was hardly a tale of\r\ninstant riches. I remembered a magazine ad—for would-be providers of\r\nInternet services—that showed a mustached man beside a Rolls or\r\nMercedes. Larry Grant was a Web merchant, not someone hooking people up\r\nwith the Net. But I wished that the get-rich-quickers of all stripes\r\ncould see Larry Grant as a realistic example of the Net’s promise. The\r\ngold might come eventually, and it was worthwhile to chase after it by\r\ngoing online, but, for most people, the big money wasn’t there yet.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, costs for newer customers of Branch Mall were higher. Grant\r\nhad been the first merchant there and enjoyed a break. Now Branch was\r\ncharging thousands a year for Web areas that included elaborate\r\nprogramming and creative work.[2.6]\r\n\r\nLarry Grant, in any event, believed in the Net and in the Mall itself.\r\nHis virtual operation wasn’t costing him _that_ much, and I suspected\r\nthat even with somewhat higher expenses, other tenants might do fine in\r\nthe end if they were in the right business. “Number one,” Grant said,\r\n“we don’t have to take and buy more inventory. Number two, we don’t have\r\nto have a bigger facility. And number three, we don’t need a sales\r\nstaff. We can do with the staff we have in handling these orders. It’s a\r\nneat way to find new business. I don’t have to handle any of the\r\nproducts directly. The customer does all the ordering through the\r\ncompany in his area and it’s shipped from the company to them, and I get\r\nmy commission check at the end of the month.” He liked the concept so\r\nmuch that he started a Fuller Brush franchise on the Net. The same key\r\nprinciples applied: No inventory to worry about and no sales staff, just\r\nsome dealings with Branch and orders emerging from a fax machine.\r\n\r\nMerchants like Bob Lilienfeld might fare well without a cybermall\r\ninvolved—they knew how to spread word about themselves on the Net by way\r\nof newsgroups and mailing lists—but I could also see the possibilities\r\nfor people such as Larry Grant as long as they kept their expectations\r\nto a reasonable level. Grant himself didn’t view the other flower shops\r\nat Branch Mall as direct competitors; he depicted himself as more of a\r\ngeneral florist than the others, what with their specialties in Hawaiian\r\nflowers and the like. Certainly a good cybermall, like the\r\nbrick-and-concrete version, needed a good tenant mix—with a toy store\r\nnot appearing on the same screen as, say, a _sex_ toy shop.\r\n\r\nIf that right mix wasn’t around, why have the mall in the first place?\r\nWhile it was true that the Net shrank distances, it did take time to\r\nmove from screen to screen at typical modem speeds. And yet, reflecting,\r\nI could indeed see a future for malls. Even when search engines were\r\neasier to use, people might still not avail themselves of\r\nthem—preferring to browse instead. So the mall concept might well endure\r\nto the advantage of people like Larry Grant.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of people itched for their percentages of the cybermall\r\nbusiness. Jon Zeeff, the mall operator who had set up Larry Grant with\r\nhis electronic billboard, had once written medical software. David Fry\r\nwas a Harvard Ph.D. in computer science, came from a family in the\r\nprinting business, and ran an offshoot called Fry Multimedia. Ann Arbor\r\nwasn’t Silicon Valley, but just in that one university town, at least\r\nthree local business people were on the Web in a serious way, if you\r\nincluded Bob Lilienfeld. Like him, Fry wisely thought in the long term.\r\nDrumming up business from well-known brands such as Ragu spaghetti\r\nsauce, he did not promise an instant audience in the millions. He urged\r\ncompanies to go on the Web, experiment with interactive advertising, and\r\nmake their mistakes _before_ the Net became a truly mass medium for\r\nMadison Avenue.\r\n\r\nSome get-rich-quickers, of course, also were jostling for virtual\r\ntenants; even Canter and Siegel showed up by way of an area called\r\nCybersell, and I enjoyed the irony. C & S had carpet bombed thousands of\r\nnewsgroups with the same message—while encouraging other merchants to\r\nignore conventional Netiquette—and yet now they were also relying on the\r\nmore focused approach of a Web area.\r\n\r\nPhone companies, too, wanted to run malls on the World Wide Web. And\r\nthat created problems for some. While the Net might use their phone\r\nlines, many of these corporations felt out of place in an anarchistic\r\nenvironment over which they had far less than the accustomed amount of\r\ncontrol. In the mall business they would be competing against nimble\r\nentrepreneurs like Zeeff and Fry. Still, phone companies could take\r\nadvantage of their existing networks to one extent or another, and if\r\nthe Yellow Pages were going online in a new incarnation, then the Baby\r\nBells and AT&T wanted their share of the business. Of all the\r\nmall-related efforts in early 1995, the most ambitious may have been\r\nfrom a phone company, MCI. It exemplified—as I soon discovered in the\r\nmost direct of ways—both the best and the worst of Big Business on the\r\nWeb.\r\n\r\nMCI’s Giant Cybermall and the\r\nSearch For Darlene\r\n\r\nMCI and the Internet had A History. The Net used phone lines from many\r\ncompanies, but MCI had long been one of the major players here; some 40\r\npercent of the Internet traffic in the United States passed over its\r\ncables, and nowadays the senior vice-president of data architecture was\r\nnone other than Vint Cerf. As much as anyone he was Mr. Net, one of the\r\nfounding fathers. MCI also employed the head of a standard-setting body\r\ncalled the Internet Engineering Task Force. Unsurprisingly, MCI\r\nmarketers were coming out with statements in the vein of: _When you\r\nthink Internet, we want you to think of us._\r\n\r\nI asked a product manager how much of the Net-related commerce he could\r\nenvision involving an electronic marketplace from MCI. Well, he said,\r\nMCI had around one-fifth of the long-distance business in the U.S.—and\r\nwhy not the same share on the Internet?\r\n\r\nClearly, however, if MCI wanted to woo the Larry Grants of this world,\r\nit faced a major marketing problem. Just like Jon Zeeff, it would have\r\nto sell business people on the Net as a vehicle for their messages; and\r\nthat meant _lots_ of education, not just hype. MCI, moreover, was\r\noffering a range of services far, far broader than Zeeff’s. In an\r\nMCI-perfect world, you would advertise your business by way of\r\nmarketplaceMCI. Prospective customers on the Net could browse through a\r\ngiant online directory and follow a link to your electronic storefront.\r\nMCI would cleverly lure them to its area. People would be able to\r\nretrieve voice phone numbers in far-off cities and enjoy other\r\ninformation services for free.\r\n\r\nOn MCI’s planet, you’d of course use internetMCI for your electronic\r\nmail and your Web browsing. You also could hold video conferences during\r\nwhich people saw not only each other but the same contract or\r\nspreadsheet, which they could jointly modify even if they were thousands\r\nof miles apart. You could even receive updates on your pet news topic by\r\nway of MCI—just the ticket for keeping up with competitors or with a\r\nfavorite athletic team.\r\n\r\nNot all of MCI’s new services related to the Internet. But like\r\nmarketplaceMCI, many did. And even with 30 million people hooked in by\r\nway of e-mail if nothing else, public ignorance was massive. Larry\r\nMagid, a computer columnist, observed that even a single TV show such as\r\n_Home Improvement_ could attract greater numbers. If MCI wanted to enjoy\r\nvolume befitting a phone company, then, it had better prepare for some\r\nmajor evangelizing—about both the Net and non-Net services. MCI tried\r\nthe broadcast model in the most traditional of ways. Splashy commercials\r\naired on national television. They starred a fictitious publishing\r\ncompany, Gramercy Press, whose president, Peter Hoffman, had a _big_\r\ncrush on MCI. Whether the service was video conferencing or electronic\r\nmail, Hoffman was itching to open his wallet for it.\r\n\r\nDarlene Davis was the character with the most air time, the hip young\r\nreceptionist who was waging a valiant battle to get Martin Banks, the\r\nresident technophobe, online. If this portly old crank of an editor\r\nwanted to read the latest memos from Darlene, then he had better plug in\r\nhis computer. Curtiss Bruno was the sales manager with his heart on his\r\nquotas and Darlene. MCI’s electronic services could allow him to achieve\r\nat least the former goal. Nowadays Darlene happily used e-mail to help\r\nstay out of flirting distance with him. Ellen deRosset was the resident\r\nintellectual snob and a Net browser. Reginald Gales used MCI’s news\r\nfeature to keep Martin up on cricket scores. Marta Dragelov was an info\r\njunky in keeping with her duties as a fact checker.\r\n\r\nIn a country where fantasy and reality often turned into one big mush,\r\nwhere O. J. Simpson movies could go into production before the end of\r\nthe murder trial, where legions of commercials aped news programs, where\r\nthe Speaker of the House would soon be hosting a cable TV showing of\r\n_Boys Town_ after having touted orphanages as a major solution to the\r\nwelfare problem—in a nation like this, it was as inevitable as a $1\r\nmillion book deal for O.J. that the mythical Darlene would draw job\r\noffers and marriage proposals from people wanting to be part of the fun.\r\n\r\n“These were breakout and breakaway characters that took on a life of\r\ntheir own,” said Mark Pettit, the MCI public relations man who was\r\nhandling Gramercy matters. What’s more, the company’s advertising\r\nagency, MVBMS, hadn’t just tried to make Gramercy real in the real\r\nworld; the agency people had also made the characters real in the\r\n_video_ world by way of an introductory commercial that looked like a\r\npreview of a new fall series.\r\n\r\nHaving conquered TV, then, and with the Internet a main focus of the ad\r\ncampaign, how could MCI _not_ have opened up a Web area to ballyhoo the\r\nsame services that Darlene was pushing on the tube? The commercials had\r\nwhetted interest in the characters. And now MCI would see if it could\r\nsatisfy this curiosity while also passing on more details about its new\r\nline of services. “People wanted more than thirty seconds of\r\ninformation,” Pettit said, “and it can be hard to give them more on TV.\r\nWhat if we turned this into a real place that they could go visit? And\r\nthat’s how it came to life.” By MCI’s own estimate, more than a million\r\npeople visited the “real place” in the first six weeks or so. Even Bob\r\nLilienfeld dropped by. He was an MCI stockholder and wanted to keep an\r\nopen mind despite his skepticism about the mall concept—maybe he could\r\ndo business with pros like MCI’s. Lilienfeld filled out a form that\r\noffered a two-month trial of Net-related services, and waited.\r\n\r\nI first visited the Gramercy Press around the same time that Lilienfeld\r\ndid. The site popped up on my screen with color photos of a\r\nperky-looking Darlene and friends. I saw a red logo, too. A small “GP”\r\nappeared between “Gramercy” and “Press,” a nice little touch that a real\r\npublisher might have tried. I wondered what ambitions MCI had. Might it\r\nturn the fictitious GP into a commercial publisher someday? The screen\r\nsaid Gramercy was “The World’s First Virtual Publishing House,” and\r\nacross the top I saw color photos of Darlene and friends, all looking as\r\nreal as ever. If I’d been impatient for a hard sell, I could have\r\nclicked immediately on items such as “networkBusiness” or “MCI\r\nTelecommunications, Inc.”\r\n\r\nBut like the rest of the cosmos, I was more keen on reading some virtual\r\ngossip from virtual humans. In a primitive way, reminiscent of many a\r\nbest-seller, a teaser led me on. I learned that the people of Gramercy\r\nwere “working on secret projects, curt memos, random thoughts,\r\nMachiavellian power plays,” and that I might “even browse a clandestine\r\nlove letter or two about to be sent via e-mail across the corridor.”\r\n\r\nSo I clicked, with much anticipation, on “Gramercy Press.” Against a\r\ndark, purplish-blue sky I saw a semiornate, low-rise office building,\r\nthe same one featured in the TV commercial. Not to leave anything to\r\nchance, a caption told me about tweeds and patches and old pipes _and_\r\nthe fact that “every one—from the receptionist to the president\r\nhimself—is online via networkMCI Business.” Despite the clichés such as\r\nthe stereotypical reference to tweeds, this site was clearly showing far\r\nmore imagination than the usual WWW area did.\r\n\r\n“Now,” the screen told me, “click on any window and you’ll start to get\r\na feel of the inside workings of a major New York publishing concern.”\r\n\r\nI chose a pane on the top floor and saw Darlene near her keyboard,\r\nsmiling away and looking as if I’d caught her in the middle of an\r\nintense gossip session. The screen suggested that I click for audio. I\r\ndid and downloaded a short snippet. “I love technology,” she said in a\r\nhigh-pitched, girlish voice, and giggled a little nervously as if to\r\ntell the world, “Hey, I’m a real person, not an actress taping an ad.”\r\n\r\nThe text on the screen was credibly self-promotional: “I’m a combination\r\nof a staff psychiatrist, gopher, organizer, coffee maker,\r\nruffled-feather soother, astrologer, party organizer, invitation sender,\r\nflower orderer, delivered-lunch acceptor, and philosopher. Oh yes, I\r\nalso disseminate messages. A job made infinitely easier thanks to\r\ne-mailMCI. I threw out those little pink message pads. e-mailMCI is so\r\nmuch more efficient. I just click on my computer and the message gets to\r\nthe right person instantly. Whether they call back is up to them. Hey, I\r\ncan’t be their conscience, mother, and etiquette professor too. I wear\r\nenough hats. And I have many aptitudes. For instance, I was college\r\nskiing champ. You didn’t know that about me. Nor did you know I have a\r\nmaster’s degree in medieval literature. Or that Ellen deRosset is going\r\nto need an editorial assistant. Of course, she doesn’t know it yet\r\neither.”\r\n\r\nI moved on to Darlene’s e-mail by clicking on, yes, her monitor. And\r\nsuddenly I was getting another pitch from MCI in the cleverest of ways—I\r\nsaw a screen shot of a menu from e-mailMCI, complete with such commands\r\nas “Compose,” “Forward,” and “Reply.”\r\n\r\nBeneath the menu appeared a message list:\r\n\r\n          E. deRosset          Short Story Submissions\r\n          C. Bruno             Excellent Proposition\r\n          R. Gales             Cover Art Submissions\r\n          M. Dragelov          Interesting Facts\r\n          P. Hoffman           Free at Last\r\n\r\nI opened the e-mail. Ellen deRosset was complaining that “My office has\r\nmore manuscripts than the Library of Alexandria—I’m running out of room\r\nfor me. Could people submit their stories over the Internet instead of\r\nthrough the mail?” Reginald Gales wrote that he’d sent out a fax to\r\ncomputer artists, asking for submissions; and in fact MCI was offering\r\nto post the works of electronic artists, not just writers. Under the\r\nsubject line “Excellent Proposition,” Curtiss Bruno asked: “Hey Darlene,\r\nwant to come by and check out the romance section of our newest\r\ncatalog?” Funny. The TV commercials had led me to believe he might be\r\ntiring of the chase. Marta Dragelov passed on some funny trivia from a\r\nbook she was researching. Peter Hoffman announced that he would be out\r\nof the office the next week but would be keeping in touch with\r\nelectronic mail.\r\n\r\nSo, yes, I could read the same e-mail as Darlene could. But that still\r\nwasn’t full interactivity. I wanted a two-way, and the “Compose” command\r\nintrigued me; perhaps I could e-mail the crew behind the Darlene\r\ncharacter. I wrote that I was a real writer, working on a real book, for\r\na real publisher; could they please tell me what kind of responses the\r\npeople at Gramercy Press were getting over the Internet? _And how about\r\nDarlene?_\r\n\r\n“What’s she like?” I was thinking. “How’d those people choose her? Does\r\nshe enjoy computers? Has she been on the Net?” Once I established\r\ncontact with the virtual Darlene’s keepers, perhaps I could find out.\r\n\r\nHaving already snooped at Darlene’s e-mail, I went on to the offices of\r\nthe other characters. Ellen deRosset, a dark-haired woman dressed in\r\nblack, confided that she had corrected her seventh-grade teacher’s\r\ngrammar. “I read _War and Peace_ when I was fifteen. The complete works\r\nof Balzac before I was twenty-five. I think you get the picture. So I am\r\nnot happy that I was given the assignment to edit this ‘women in sports’\r\nbook. I dislike sports rather intensely. The only sport I know anything\r\nabout, really, is fencing. But one must be flexible these days, and the\r\nMCI Business software makes this assignment easier to handle, if not\r\nmore palatable.”\r\n\r\nReginald Gales told me how MCI’s e-mail and conferencing services came\r\nin handy. One of his authors lived on a caboose in Wyoming, while\r\nanother wrote from a houseboat in Florida; “he once had a shark bite off\r\nhis TV antenna.”\r\n\r\nMarta Dragelov, the fact checker, was an avid user of MCI’s news-flash\r\nservice, which crammed her computer with such items as, “India Asks\r\nPhone Firms to Set Up Local Factories”—actual news stories that I could\r\nsee while clicking on them. Peter Hoffman was away at home and working\r\nin his pajamas. Martin Banks, the technophobic editor, said he was\r\n“being tutored on the wonders of MCI electronic office ephemera by none\r\nother than Miss Ellen deRosset.” He hoped that she would notice his new\r\npair of wing tips.\r\n\r\nThe real payoff for readers was in Curtiss Bruno’s office. Wearing a\r\nstriped shirt and a tie and looking like an incurable office politician,\r\nhe nevertheless held a hand over his mouth as if to say: “Maybe I’d\r\nbetter shut up before I spill too much.” Oh, Curtiss, why bother? I\r\ncould tour an electronic version of the not-quite-completed winter\r\ncatalogue—with listings of fiction, visual arts, poetry, and nonfiction.\r\n\r\nAll categories carried dates older than the Web area itself—MCI was\r\napparently relying on imaginary contributors to prime the pumps. “Ivana\r\ndiTommaso’s” background just seemed too _New Yorker_-ish. She had “grown\r\nup in Bologna, Italy, and Grosse Pointe, Michigan” and had “developed\r\nfrom a quiet film student” to “one of America’s fine short story\r\nwriters.” If she existed, the electronic catalogue at the Library of\r\nCongress had yet to note it when I made a short detour by way of my\r\nsoftware’s task-switching capability. Not that I trusted the catalogue.\r\nA branch of Random House had published my first book, _The Silicon\r\nJungle_, yet it was missing from the LC catalogue that day; and for all\r\nI knew, maybe the librarians had also neglected the accomplished Ms.\r\ndiTommaso. I charitably allowed for the fact that she just might exist.\r\n\r\nHer story, “The Legend of Wendell County,” told how a county records\r\nkeeper had become a community grandmother who, not content to record\r\nbirths, deaths, and divorces, tried her hand at marriage counseling and\r\nother social workish pursuits—until one day she lost her way in winter\r\nand turned into something else, a ghost. The bottom of the page carried\r\nan authentic-looking “© 1994 Ivana diTommaso.”\r\n\r\nI moved on. “The Tree House” was a story from Katy Rudder, a member of\r\n“the first Peace Corps class ever assigned to China, where she is\r\nteaching English at Leshan Teachers College in the Sichuan Province.”\r\nBased on what I was reading, MCI’s artistic tastes—or its ad\r\nagency’s—were corporately wholesome. And so were its contributors. I\r\ndoubted that Gramercy would have been the best place for the young\r\nBurroughs or Kerouac.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this would change, maybe Gramercy would grow more adventurous\r\nwith time, but right now I wasn’t sanguine in that regard. The\r\nnonfiction area was a real loss with just one title, of a harmless,\r\ntheological type. I doubted that this would be the place for, say,\r\nSeymour Hersh or Robert Caro. Like the writing, the art looked competent\r\nand maybe much better, but, again, safely within corporate parameters.\r\n\r\nThe most cautious contributors were MCI’s lawyers, or whoever else had\r\nwritten the legalese for one Web site. All writers and artists had to\r\nsend in releases saying they wouldn’t sue MCI for using accidentally\r\nsimilar material. The lawyers warned, “All work that is submitted\r\nelectronically over the Internet needs to be accompanied by a hard copy\r\nof the release form, sent in separately by postal mail. We will not look\r\nat any work placed on our server until we have received the hard copy of\r\nthe release form. All files on the server older than 14 days, for which\r\nwe have not received a release, will not be reviewed....” I remembered\r\nthe essay on theology. It was uninspired enough for an attorney other\r\nthan Scott Turow to have written it, and sure enough, the author’s note\r\nsaid he was “happy with the practice of law.”\r\n\r\nDespite the less-than-striking short stories and the soporific essay, I\r\nloved the sparkle of Gramercy Press as a whole. I recalled an area on\r\nthe Web known as Bianca’s Smut Shack. Its creators let you get inside\r\nthe head of a virtual woman, let you know what books she read, what\r\nmovies she watched, what records she listened to, and you could add your\r\nown opinions. At the time I’d told the Shack crew, “Watch out, folks.\r\nDon’t be surprised if a big company creates characters in an ad where\r\n_everyone_ buys the right products.” Well, it had happened. And MCI and\r\nits advertising agency had done many good things that people with their\r\nresources could more easily accomplish.\r\n\r\nBuilding Notre Dame, thousands of workers had pieced together the stone,\r\nfashioned the gargoyles, assembled the stained-glass windows. And the\r\nMCI Web area, while hardly art, was somewhat like a cathedral. The\r\narea’s masterminds had bungled in some ways, but they had used sheer\r\nstaff power to toil over countless details.\r\n\r\nI was sorry when Mark Pettit told me that some Real People in Publishing\r\nhad hated Gramercy Press. Didn’t they get it? Granted, the publishing\r\ncompany was stereotypical to the point of being self-satirizing. But so\r\nwhat? I was no more expecting MCI to be a first-rate publisher than I\r\nwas expecting Random House to lay fiber-optic cable.\r\n\r\nAs a display of the Web’s potential to attract a mass audience, of\r\ncourse, the Gramercy endeavor had triumphed. For consumer business on\r\nthe Net to take off, ads would have to be a complete departure from\r\nthose on television, and MCI had done just that—even if it was able to\r\nbenefit from characters from the older medium. Many small-timers could\r\nnever have discovered an actress as perfectly suited to play Darlene as\r\nKaty Selverstone was. This was a real coup. MCI was brilliantly drawing\r\nin a big crowd through a skillful interplay of television, print, and\r\nthe Net.\r\n\r\nSelverstone herself had become a living ad for MCI, drawing stare after\r\nstare as she walked down the Manhattan streets. Her Gramercy role was a\r\nreal tribute to her acting ability. _Entertainment Weekly_ described her\r\nas not “much of a gadget-head. ‘I’ve got a 12-inch, black-and-white TV\r\nthat emits a faint gaseous odor,’ she says. ‘And I have to change\r\nchannels with a pair of pliers.’” The word from MCI was that she’d just\r\nbought a computer and would herself be on the Net. Advertisers hired\r\nmodels today on the basis of looks and I wondered if, in the future,\r\nthey would consider the ability to give good chat online.\r\n\r\nA major problem, however, arose with this scenario in MCI’s case. While\r\nI hadn’t asked for an interview or e-mail from the real Darlene, I had\r\nyet even to hear from her handlers after six weeks. These people had\r\nwooed me with a first-class Web area and encouraged me to write in, and\r\nyet they had then ignored me except for a little boilerplate from their\r\nDarlene-bot, who said she was busy coping with “emergencies.” The MCI\r\nmedia crew reinforced my skepticism; only after a series of phone calls\r\nwas I able to pry basic information. On a day when Pettit solemnly\r\npromised he’d talked to me, he was off holding a press conference for\r\nthe _Wall Street Journal_ and the other usual suspects without alerting\r\nme about the postponement. Clearly this was a big company focused on\r\nother big companies, and I wondered if the small merchants in the Web\r\narea might suffer if they entrusted their fates to MCI. I myself was not\r\njust a writer. I made it clear that I was also a customer of MCI Mail,\r\nan electronic mail service to which I had subscribed for a decade.\r\nPerhaps someday I might even want a Web area through MCI. And this was\r\nthe treatment I got?\r\n\r\nIf MCI slighted me—a writer-customer who spoke out in print and on the\r\nNet, and who had many friends there—how would it treat the Larry Grants\r\nof the future? I thought of the elusive, virtual character who had asked\r\nme to write to her. In a metaphorical sense, small merchants might\r\nfutilely spend their days searching for Darlene. Now I wondered about\r\nBob Lilienfeld. How was he coming along with his own information\r\nrequest? Was there _any_ chance that White Rabbit might end up in an\r\nelectronic mall after all? Lilienfeld, albeit not a mall booster, was in\r\nmany ways a good prospect since he was so Net oriented and could\r\nappreciate a good deal. Why, he even owned stock in MCI.\r\n\r\nEfficiently, however, MCI had alienated Bob Lilienfeld. Just like me, he\r\nhad not heard a peep out of the company, even after filling out a form\r\nfor his two months of trial services. He had followed up with three\r\ne-mail notes to an address set aside for prospects like him. I told\r\nMCI’s media people about this mini-debacle and was assured that someone\r\nwould contact Lilienfeld. But after several weeks, no one had. MCI was\r\nnicely apologetic, of course. Mark Pettit and colleagues reminded me of\r\nthe huge number of people who had replied to the Gramercy Press ad. They\r\nsaid, too, that MCI technical people were busy at work answering\r\nquestions, while creative types handled the correspondence for Darlene.\r\nBut they were missing the point. This was a massive advertising\r\ncampaign, and they should have planned for success as well as failure.\r\n\r\nThe issue _should_ not have had anything to do with corporate size. MCI\r\ncould have requested zip codes and states and sorted out Darlene’s\r\ne-mail in that way—for area sales reps to answer if her handlers in New\r\nYork were swamped. In fact, the form that Lilienfeld filled out did ask\r\nfor his postal address. It also inquired, “What interests you?” so that,\r\nduring the two-month trial, MCI could mail him news stories through the\r\nnew automatic clipping service. “You can choose any topic: your\r\ncompetition’s advertising, the future of your industry, or southwestern\r\ncooking, anything,” MCI had assured him. And yet, after six weeks, he\r\nhadn’t received a single call or piece of literature.\r\n\r\nAs if that weren’t enough of an outrage, MCI’s fees might overwhelm many\r\nsmall business people. MCI wanted to charge some $2,000 a month for\r\ngetting them on the World Wide Web—or at least several times what many\r\nindependent malls would have billed. Yes, MCI talked about adding value\r\nthrough its brand name and through customer draws such as directory\r\nservices for the Net and for voice. It would even line up copywriters\r\nfor the storefronts. But what good would this do merchants whose volumes\r\nsimply did not justify such expenditures? Pettit reminded me that a\r\nquarter-page listing in a phone directory cost $2,000. But that wasn’t\r\ntrue in many areas, and most merchants did not take out that much space\r\nanyway. Even then the typical business person might hire an extra clerk,\r\nand perhaps have money left over for advertising with a smaller\r\ncybermall. That, of course, was projecting into the future. After all,\r\neven Larry Grant wasn’t grossing more than $15,000-20,000 a year at the\r\ntime, and the Lilienfelds had a long climb ahead to reach that level.\r\n\r\nPerhaps MCI would learn. I still loved the sparkle of the Gramercy\r\narea and hoped that it would thrive in the end. Regardless of my\r\ndoubts and frustrations, I hadn’t anything against the people of MCI,\r\nespecially Mark Pettit, who, despite his absentmindedness, had\r\nactually been more helpful than the others. MCI wasn’t Canter and\r\nSiegel. It hadn’t disrupted Usenet. As long as it paid its own way and\r\ndid not take advantage of its Net connections in ways that stifled\r\ncompetition—Washington needed to monitor MCI closely—then it could\r\nactually help the average Net user. The greater the volume on the Net,\r\nthe greater would be the virtual pipeline and the lower the cost for\r\neveryone. So, far from disliking MCI’s interest in the commercial\r\npromise of the Net, I still saw plenty of potential here. MCI simply\r\nneeded to understand the obvious. If its electronic marketplace were\r\nto succeed, then the company must price its services more\r\nrealistically and not keep customers searching for Darlene.\r\n\r\nFederal Express and Right-O-Way:\r\nAbsolutely, Positively on the Net\r\n\r\nA FedEx woman called me up and asked what the people in Memphis could do\r\nto retain my business, which had plummeted to almost zero volume.\r\n“You’ve given me great service,” I said, thinking of all the\r\nfoot-to-throttle occasions when FedEx had picked up manuscripts on\r\ndeadline. “But you see, I’m on the Internet nowadays. _Everything_ for\r\nmy current book project goes ever the wire.” I was working on a guide\r\ntelling how to lobby for one’s political beliefs online, and the\r\npublisher had even received the book proposal via the Net. Lots of\r\npeople were doing the same, not just with the Net but with commercial\r\nservices and fax. On legal lists, some lawyers were debating the\r\nvalidity of electronic mail for business matters, but the new technology\r\nwould quiet the discussion soon enough when foolproof, digital\r\nsignatures could establish the identity of the sender.\r\n\r\nNo one needs to weep for FedEx, United Parcel Service, and the rest,\r\nhowever. The typical computer is a medium-sized box full of parts that\r\ncome in much smaller boxes, such as a disk drive or a modem. And, as\r\nshown by the thickness of _Computer Shopper_ and other magazines that\r\ncater to computer users buying from afar, FedEx and similar services are\r\nthriving. That is just one example. High-tech companies, especially the\r\nnetwork kind, want reputations for reliability and fast turnarounds.\r\nThey love the FedEx slogan: “When it absolutely, positively, has to be\r\nthere overnight.” Courier services are godsends for corporations that\r\nrely on just-in-time delivery to reduce inventories of spare parts. If\r\nnothing else, this principle appeals to manufacturers with slim\r\ninventories. Also, more and more people are working at home. At the same\r\ntime, upscale consumer magazines abound with ads touting merchandise via\r\nexpress, everything from steaks to flowers.\r\n\r\nThe real question, then, isn’t how to downsize but rather how to cope\r\nwith the deluge of business in small packages. And Federal Express views\r\nthe Internet as among the more promising of many possibilities.\r\n\r\nFor years, FedEx used its own network to set up computer links through\r\nwhich high-volume, Fortune 500 companies could request pickups, track\r\nshipments, and receive invoices. First, FedEx communicated with\r\nmainframes. Then it began supplying some customers with personal\r\ncomputers; eventually, some companies shipping as few as three packages\r\na day could qualify. “We started with the biggest customers first and\r\nthen extended that service to smaller and smaller companies,” said\r\nRobert Hamilton, a marketer at FedEx dealing with information matters.\r\nThe next move was supplying tracking software through which people could\r\nuse their own machines to dial up FedEx. Step by step, FedEx was working\r\nto get almost _all_ customers online to its computers—even the operators\r\nof small home businesses.\r\n\r\nThe Internet could play an important role here because it is the closest\r\nthing to a universal computer network. By the mid-1990s people in the\r\nair freight business caught on to the advantages of the Net over the\r\nproprietary networks in many cases. The Internet reached scores of\r\ncountries, no small advantage in an internationally oriented business,\r\nand planners could use the Net’s volume to help slash the costs of\r\ntelecommunications _and_ improve service to customers. Right-O-Way, a\r\nfreight forwarder in Tustin, California, was among the Net pioneers.\r\nBack in 1992 the company had figured out how to use customers’ personal\r\ncomputers to print out bar code labels.\r\n\r\nWith portable radio-frequency scanners linked to the firm’s mainframe,\r\nRight-O-Way’s workers could track shipments for customers—could, in\r\nother words, offer the same services that Ex could. Right-O-Way’s\r\ncustomers dialed up the company directly rather than through the\r\nInternet. But in 1994, Martin Hubert, vice president of information\r\nsystems, hooked Right-O-Way into the Net for customers wanting to use\r\nit. He spent just $1,000 on additional UNIX software, modems, network\r\nsetup charges, and programming time, and $350 a month in\r\nInternet-related bills.\r\n\r\n“Some customers have tried it already,” Hubert said. “We have sales\r\npeople use the Internet to access shipping data. Our advanced overseas\r\npartners can access our computer directly for e-mail, tracking, and\r\ntracing. Customers like BMW, ClothesTime, and Packard Bell access our\r\ncomputer and save money on long-distance charges from overseas.”[2.7]\r\nThose companies could reach the Right-O-Way computer directly, getting\r\nimmediate answers while they were online. Using the Net, they could even\r\nschedule shipments. Right-O-Way told me that it protected account\r\nnumbers by requiring customers to use passwords that they received\r\nthrough sales reps and ways other than the Internet.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, the company served even customers having only the most\r\nbasic of Internet connections. Yes, you could Telnet into the\r\nRight-O-Way computer system on the Internet—could issue commands as if\r\nyou were at a keyboard at headquarters. But if you lacked Telnet\r\ncapabilities and didn’t mind the delay, you could also send electronic\r\nmail messages in the appropriate format to track shipments or issue\r\npickup orders.[2.8]\r\n\r\nAround the same time, FedEx and other industry giants were gearing up to\r\ndo business on the Internet. The Net, of course, wasn’t the only\r\npossibility. Federal Express by then was an old hand at using its own\r\nnetwork, which at the time accounted for more than 50 percent of the\r\npackages shipped. It was also distributing Windows and Mac software to\r\nenable tracking through the FedEx net. Just the same, in December 1994,\r\nafter having earlier experimented with the Net for the distribution of\r\npress releases, FedEx turned to the Internet’s World Wide Web as a way\r\nfor customers to track packages. Within FedEx’s Web area, they could key\r\nin the number of the package and get the latest information.\r\n\r\nI checked out the Web service. At www.fedex.com I saw “FedEx” in big\r\npurple and orange letters, along with a short, easy menu that led me to\r\nelectronic forms. A detour offered “Interesting Facts about FedEx!” It\r\nwas the “world’s largest express transportation company,” had 1994\r\nrevenues of $8.5 billion, employed “more than 505,515 worldwide,” served\r\n191 countries, owned more than 400 aircraft ranging from 32 Fokker F-27s\r\nto 5 Airbuses and 13 McDonnell Douglas MD-11s, operated “more than\r\n32,560 vehicles, and shipped an average of more than 2 million packages\r\neach day.” Another menu item could tell me about pickup availability. If\r\nI typed in the time I would have a shipment ready to go, my zip code,\r\nand the destination code, among other items, then FedEx would tell me\r\nhow soon it could deliver the package using Priority Overnight Service\r\nor alternatives.\r\n\r\nRight now, however, I wanted to learn the whereabouts of a test\r\npackage—containing nothing more than Robert Hamilton’s business\r\ncard—that went out under airbill number 50044562. It was a no-brainer. I\r\nchose “Select Track a FedEx Package” and keyed in the number. Almost\r\nimmediately I learned when a courier had picked up the package and when\r\nit had left Memphis. And eventually the Web would pass on other facts\r\nsuch as the name of the driver at the destination, the delivery time,\r\nand who signed for the package. An idea hit me. When you filled out an\r\nexpress form in the future, perhaps you could give both your recipient’s\r\ne-mail address and your own. Via the Net, a service could tell the other\r\nperson that a package was on the way—and after it arrived, you’d\r\nautomatically receive a receipt.\r\n\r\nEven as the FedEx area existed now, however, it was serving customer\r\nneeds well. Yes, I appreciated the flash of MCI’s efforts, and I\r\nunderstood why Darlene and friends were attracting many more people than\r\nthe courier company was right now. But compared to MCI, FedEx left me\r\nfeeling _better_. Those modest little electronic forms, the ones that\r\nwould let me track packages and check out Ex’s service availability by\r\nlocation and time, treated the customers as individuals and responded in\r\nseconds. MCI, however, ignored Bob Lilienfeld, who, disgusted, later\r\nsold his stock.\r\n\r\nOn top of everything else, MCI, which had vastly more programming talent\r\nthan FedEx did, had missed out on some major opportunities for\r\ninteractive software. I could imagine a small company keying in a\r\ndescription of its telecommunications and network requirements and\r\ngetting a series of at least basic recommendations. On a\r\npackage-by-package basis and in the most private of ways, FedEx was\r\ndoing this already—since its forms queried you about your shipping needs\r\nof the moment and then told you what services were available. The people\r\nat MCI weren’t dumb. They could turn around their operation in a\r\nflash—they might have done so by the time you read this—but in terms of\r\ncustomer service FedEx was clearly the winner right now.\r\n\r\n“Five years from now,” said Robert Hamilton, “35 or 40 percent of the\r\ncustomers connected to FedEx could be using the Internet.” His company\r\nstood a good chance of saving millions in annual communications costs\r\nand the expenses of staffing phones. “The big factor is how individuals\r\nare connected today,” he said. “With CompuServe and America Online\r\ngalloping in the direction of the Internet, maybe that will happen\r\nsooner rather than later.” FedEx would let customer usage, not official\r\ncorporate policy, drive its use of the Net, and that is exactly how it\r\nshould be. One way or another the Net would definitely figure in its\r\nplans. The only question was, “How much?”\r\n\r\nThe big need now, of course, was for customers to be able to key in\r\ntheir account numbers and get immediate pickups. FedEx did face some\r\nchallenges here. FedEx needed to blend the Internet into its existing\r\nnetwork of computers, and this complicated the security issues. FedEx\r\nwanted to make certain that a cyberthief couldn’t go on a joyride with\r\nan illegally obtained account number of a customer. So it was evaluating\r\nsecurity-enhanced software from CommerceNet, a California organization\r\nthat helped put businesses on the Net. Meanwhile, we customers could not\r\nuse the Net to schedule shipments through Federal Express. FedEx had\r\noffered a temporary solution: we could at least download software that\r\nlet us call up the company directly, or we could reach FedEx via America\r\nOnline or another commercial network. That would do for the moment.\r\n\r\nMulling over what I’d seen and heard up to now, I could not escape three\r\nconclusions. First, it was clear that computer networks could be a help,\r\nnot a threat, to delivery companies that were trying to upgrade service.\r\nNo longer would I have to wait for an operator to schedule a pickup or\r\ncheck on shipments from FedEx. The second conclusion was broader: The\r\nNet often could be good for corporations of _all_ sizes, not just\r\nFortune 500 firms like FedEx. Right-O-Way had staked out its own place\r\nin cyberspace by going for the simplest solution—Telnet and electronic\r\nmail—rather than worrying first about the World Wide Web. The company\r\ncould add the Web later. On the Internet, with its inherent economies\r\nfor the Right-O-Ways of this world, “smaller” didn’t have to mean\r\n“backwards.”\r\n\r\nThe third conclusion about these case histories resulted from my\r\ncomparisons of MCI and the courier companies, and it transcended the\r\nfact that they were in different industries. Even on the Internet, good\r\ncustomer service would have to be a company’s first priority and counted\r\neven more than the technology per se. Oh, you could use electronic\r\nforms. But unless you programmed the forms to provide the right\r\nservices—rather than simply trying to sell The Product and awe the\r\ncustomers—you might actually alienate the people you were trying to\r\nbefriend. MCI didn’t understand this sufficiently. FedEx and Right-O-Way\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nIntel: How the Net Helped Turn an\r\nAdvertising Sticker into a Warning Label\r\n\r\nThe Internet, of course, can hurt as well as help business. Well\r\npopulated with skeptical academics—whose postings often find their way\r\nonto the screens of equally skeptical journalists—the Net is a good\r\nplace to learn about scams. Legitimate companies, of course, needn’t\r\nworry: They will benefit as word of their successful products spreads,\r\nand the Net excels as a conduit for rumor control. Should there ever be\r\nanother Tylenol scare, you can bet that publicists will use the Net to\r\nget the truth out. Even legitimate businesses, however, can feel the\r\nwrath of the Net if they err—as Intel, the chip maker, found out in the\r\nugliest of ways after it released the Pentium chip.\r\n\r\nThe Pentium chip was the new flagship product, the speedster that would\r\nlet PCs impinge on minicomputer territory. But that wasn’t all. Intel\r\nenvisioned the Pentium as the perfect chip for computers aimed at the\r\nhome market. No longer would Mom, Pop, and The Kids poke along with\r\ncomputers weaker than those at the office. Thanks to Intel, they would\r\nenjoy glitzy cartoons, educational programs, and other multimedia\r\nofferings in full glory on their machines at home. Intel launched a\r\nmajor TV campaign and persuaded scores of computer makers to adorn their\r\nboxes and ads with “Intel Inside” stickers. Intel was looking ahead to\r\nmillions of dollars of Christmas-related sales. At the time, I suspect,\r\nthe Internet didn’t figure that prominently in Intel’s plans. Its Net\r\narea was hardly as dazzling or as ambitious as those of many other\r\ncompanies. That would change.\r\n\r\nThe trouble started when a mathematics professor in Virginia found that\r\nunder certain conditions, the Pentium chip would make mistakes in\r\narithmetic. There at Lynchburg College, Dr. Thomas Nicely couldn’t\r\nbelieve his screen. To his amazement, he was able to verify that the\r\nchip, not the human, was at fault here. In October 1994 the professor’s\r\n“Bug in the Pentium” memo went out over the Internet. It circulated\r\nrapidly from mailing list to mailing list, from newsgroup to newsgroup,\r\nas well as on commercial nets such as CompuServe and Prodigy.\r\n\r\nPentium-hostile messages flew back and forth between scientists,\r\ncorporate executives, consultants, and other influential people, who,\r\nthanks to the Internet, could share complaints more efficiently than\r\never. Intel tried some damage control via the Net and in press\r\nstatements. The heat reached the point where the head of Intel asked a\r\nunderling to issue an apology and a technical explanation. The message\r\nbetrayed corporate panic, pure and simple. “I am posting from my home\r\nsystem,” Richard Wirt, Director of Software Technology, prefaced a\r\nweekend note. And then came an “I am truly sorry” message from Andy\r\nGrove, President of Intel. In various statements Intel assured customers\r\nthat the average computer user would typically run across the problem\r\nonce every 27,000 years. The official line was that nontechnical people\r\nneedn’t worry. Intel announced it would replace chips _if_ people could\r\nshow that the defect could harm their work.\r\n\r\nThat still didn’t placate the Net and the media. Netwise reporters at\r\npapers such as the _Washington Post_ and _New York Times_ and at\r\n_Newsday_ warned the thousands of Christmas shoppers who were about to\r\nbuy $2,000 Pentium machines. Billions of dollars were at stake here.\r\nComputer makers had already moved millions of Pentium machines, and IBM\r\ncame out with a statement saying that it would replace defective\r\nchips—even though Intel kept claiming that the nontechnical need not\r\nworry. It didn’t help when shoppers learned that Intel knew about the\r\nPentium’s defects as early as June.\r\n\r\nWhat most threatened the Pentium, however, may have been the humor. It\r\nstarted on the Net and, via mailing lists such as On-Line News, reached\r\nmajor newspapers. David Letterman started cracking jokes. Politicians\r\nand chips had something in common. If still quite alive when Letterman\r\nridiculed it, the Pentium was headed toward the emergency room\r\nafterward—given the speed with which the story was traveling around. On\r\nthe Net itself, and on the front pages, typical Pentium humor went\r\nsomething like this:\r\n\r\n    Q. “How many Pentium designers does it take to screw in a light\r\n        bulb?”\r\n\r\n    A. “1.99904274017, but that’s close enough for nontechnical people.”\r\n\r\n    Q. “What do you get when you cross a Pentium PC with a research\r\n        grant?”\r\n\r\n    A. “A mad scientist.”\r\n\r\n    Q. “What’s another name for the “Intel Inside” sticker they put on\r\n        Pentiums?”\r\n\r\n    A. “The warning label.”\r\n\r\nMaintaining to the end that this was more of a marketing problem than a\r\ntechnical one, Intel relented. It agreed to replace chips for free\r\nwithout interrogating the public. What’s more, Intel expanded its\r\npresence on the Net. It now offered a nice area on the World Wide Web\r\nwith items ranging from product descriptions to job announcements.\r\nStill, this fiasco aside, Intel had a good reputation for quality\r\ncontrol, and by not shrinking from the Net community, it was responding\r\ncorrectly.\r\n\r\nAnother major lesson should also have sunk in among marketers of all\r\nkinds—beyond the obvious fact that the Internet could spread news of\r\nflawed products. Customers throughout the world could use the same\r\nchannels to find out about geographically based price gouges. If a\r\nsoftware firm charged reasonable prices in the United States but boosted\r\nprice tags for Europeans, then the Net would spread the word. Software\r\ncompanies might not appreciate this immediately, but sooner or later\r\nthey would. This was especially true of companies sending their products\r\nover the Net. The Internet Adapter, the product that had proven to be so\r\ngood to my wallet, would have cost me $25 even if I’d lived in\r\nAntarctica or New Zealand. I wondered how long it would be before the\r\ntraditional vendors of shrink-wrapped software would understand this\r\nlesson and stop squeezing customers outside the United States. Even with\r\nthe expenses of middle people and translation factored in, the prices of\r\nsome American software products were too high in Europe. Consumerism on\r\nthe Net just might make the marketplace more sane.\r\n\r\nOther Hazards For Business People\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, the old sixties people saw the Internet as a victory\r\nof smallness over big corporations. Little companies could use the Net\r\nin new and imaginative ways and woo prospects thousands of miles away.\r\nSome enthusiasts promoted the Net as a powerful weapon for individuals\r\nwho hated life in sluggish, bloated corporations.\r\n\r\nStill, the Net might not always be a Nirvana for small entrepreneurs.\r\nConsider the Lilienfelds. What if toy companies decided to sell on the\r\nNet directly, for example? The Lilienfelds themselves could still fare\r\nwell since they were working hard to become known for personal service.\r\nFor example, if a toy weren’t shown online, Bob might even scan in a\r\nphoto from a wholesaler’s catalogue and e-mail it to an interested\r\nbuyer. And he and his wife were planning to make themselves a\r\nconspicuous presence in relevant newsgroups, while respecting\r\nnetiquette. But not all of the small merchants would be as astute and\r\ndedicated. I suspected that many bankruptcies lay ahead.\r\n\r\nOther problems might hit large as well as tiny companies. Many customers\r\nrefused to give their credit card numbers online; in fact, many stores\r\ndidn’t even _want_ them. The Net wasn’t entirely secure. Theoretically,\r\nsnoops in a number of locations could intercept orders and pick up the\r\nMasterCard or VISA numbers with software that looked for common data\r\nassociated with credit cards. I regarded this as a temporary problem.\r\nLilienfeld had dealt with it nicely by letting people—at least those in\r\nthe United States—phone in their credit card numbers for free. The\r\nnumbers would remain safe in White Rabbit’s computers, ready for future\r\ntransactions. Besides, as Lilienfeld pointed out, it wasn’t worth the\r\ntrouble for thieves to keep a tab on small stores like his.\r\n\r\nBigger businesses, however, were right to worry, and solutions were on\r\nthe way. Popular browsers such as Netscape, for example, were coming\r\nwith security features. Customers would be able to effortlessly transmit\r\ntheir credit card numbers in encoded form.\r\n\r\nWhat about the problem of customers without sufficient funds to pay for\r\nmerchandise? Some Web merchants could almost instantly verify that a\r\ncustomer had enough money in a credit account. The process would be even\r\neasier if companies such as Microsoft followed through with plans to\r\nteam up with credit card companies. But that still left another worry\r\nfor customers—privacy.\r\n\r\nIf you use old-fashioned paper money, your transactions aren’t\r\ntraceable. With electronic money—or with regular credit or conventional\r\ndebit cards—they might be. What if you were a gay woman, lived in a\r\nsmall Arkansas town, and enjoyed lesbian literature? Or suppose that in\r\nthe future you were caught up in a divorce and your wife employed a\r\ncyberdetective to snoop on your spending habits? DigiCash, a company in\r\nAmsterdam, thought it had a solution in the form of anonymous electronic\r\nmoney that you could spend without being traced. Only your digital\r\nbanker would know for sure. The possibility, of course, gave fits to tax\r\ncollectors throughout the world. It was one of the reasons why\r\nbureaucrats in the United States had lobbied so hard for industry to\r\nadopt the Clipper chip, which allowed federal snoops to break its codes.\r\nClearly, however, the Clipper effort could _harm_ U.S. companies.\r\nSuppose foreign governments used a similar approach—making it easier to\r\nsteal commercial secrets from American-owned multinationals?\r\n\r\nStill another threat to business is from people who might spy on or\r\nchange data on corporate systems. Hackers got into General Electric\r\ncomputers containing secrets. The solution to these electronic thefts,\r\nin many cases, was stronger “firewalls”—electronic gateways between\r\npublic and private areas. In some instances, however, the threat was\r\nexaggerated. Yes, in theory, hackers could turn your home phone into a\r\npay phone or make off with your corporate password or spy on your\r\nelectronic mail. And some hated commercial activities on the Net and\r\nwere ready to act. But by far, these were exceptions: most of the better\r\nhackers were benign—they saw themselves more as scholars than as snoops\r\nand saboteurs. Indeed, old-timers would not use the word “hackers” to\r\ndescribe the malevolent; no, they were “crackers.”\r\n\r\nIronically, on the Net, the real worry isn’t hackers but snoopy\r\ncompetitors, who, without necessarily breaking the law, can find out\r\ninformation about prices and new products much more efficiently than\r\nbefore. A rival phone company has paid thousands and thousands of visits\r\nto the MCI area on the Web. This must be going on constantly. Earlier,\r\nDigital Equipment Corporation offered software demonstrations over the\r\nNet and found that its competitors were tying the machines up. More\r\nscrupulously, companies could use powerful searching tools such as the\r\nLycos on the Web to seek out files mentioning rivals’ products. They\r\ncould also send the names of rivals to a computer at Stanford\r\nUniversity. And then whenever a company was mentioned in a major Usenet\r\nnewsgroup, an electronic clipping service would send the information\r\nback to them at no charge. A careless engineer or marketer could\r\njeopardize thousands or millions in investments. The answer, of course,\r\nis to educate people about the risks.\r\n\r\nNot so controllable is the risk of companies using the Net to troll for\r\nunfavorable mentions of rivals—grist for negative advertising. There is\r\nonly one solution: make better products or give better service.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the goods and services discussed here, a major kind is conspicuously\r\nmissing so far: entertainment. Some of the best is free. Just ahead\r\nyou’ll find a favorite of many Netfolks—the Internet Underground Music\r\nArchive, from which you can download free samples from top hits as well\r\nas surprises from new musicians.\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER\r\n                                 THREE\r\n\r\n    EntertaiNet: A Few\r\n    Musings on Net.Rock,\r\n    Leonardo da Vinci and\r\n    Bill Gates, Bianca’s\r\n    Smut Shack, and\r\n    David Letterman\r\n    in Cyberspace\r\n\r\n\r\nDon’t count on the Ugly Mugs pushing Billy Joel off the charts, or even\r\nshowing up at your closest record store.\r\n\r\nThey’re zany, avant-garde musicians whose work is a cross between Frank\r\nZappa and freakish, carnival rock—not the stuff of the Top 40. But Jeff\r\nPatterson, a thin, pale guitarist with a fondness for old jeans and\r\ngreen-topped sneakers, can still spread the word about himself and the\r\nother Mugs. Their music is on the Internet. Fans as far off as Turkey\r\nand Japan can dial the Internet Underground Music Archive run by\r\nPatterson and his “co-czar,” Rob Lord. Hundreds of musicians are\r\nsuddenly in cyberspace. For just $100 a year they can pay IUMA to post\r\ncuts from their music, complete with information on how you can send\r\naway for the CDs and tapes. In fact, some have even posted complete\r\nsongs to the Net for free.\r\n\r\nTens of thousands of Netfolk a week dial up IUMA, making 200,000\r\npage-accesses—perhaps a third of the attention that _Playboy_ gets, but\r\nstill one of the best numbers on the Web. That’s no small feat: The\r\narchive more or less started in a tiny room with a bare lightbulb\r\ndangling from the ceiling, and it is still a low-budget operation run by\r\ntwo information science majors.\r\n\r\nIUMA is just one of many delights on the Net for techies and\r\ntechnophobes alike. Entertainment and culture are taking off in a major\r\nway in cyberspace just when clueless Snubbites are deriding the Net as\r\nartless. I can enjoy gifted but unheralded performers, from reggae\r\nartists to banjo players. The New Zealand Symphony is online with a\r\ndigitized rendition of the national anthem down there. Imagine the\r\npossibilities for fans of classical music in the future—the chances to\r\nhear live performances of Tchaikovsky directly from Moscow, or enjoy\r\nclassical Chinese music from Peking or Taipei. Net.radio is already\r\nhere. WYXC, for example, a station at the University of North Carolina\r\nat Chapel Hill, sends rock music into the ether twenty-four hours a day.\r\n\r\nRunning software called RealAudio, owners of deluxe home computers can\r\nhear top-ten rap from an Internet site in South Korea, astrological\r\nforecasts from England, and selected programs from ABC News, National\r\nPublic Radio, the C-SPAN cable network, the radio version of the\r\n_Christian Science Monitor_, the National Press Club, the Canadian\r\nBroadcasting Corporation, and a wealth of other draws whenever they\r\nwant—even weeks or months after the original broadcasts.\r\n\r\nJust a mouse click on the right Web address conjures up a Daniel Schorr\r\ncommentary, or a feature about the Illinois reporter whom the mob\r\nsupposedly buried in concrete, or scads of other NPR offerings that I\r\nwish I could have enjoyed when they first aired. I don’t have to bother\r\nwith tricky downloads of files containing the sound. This happens on its\r\nown.\r\n\r\nRealAudio sounds rather muffled right now, at least on my computer, as\r\nif the technology is a throwback to 1920s radio. But sooner or later it\r\nwill make FM stereo seem antediluvian.\r\n\r\nConsider, too, the diversity of programming from grassroots people who\r\ncan broadcast at a fraction of the costs of even peanut-whistle\r\nstations. Thousands of mom-and-pop sites—unencumbered by the Federal\r\nCommunications Commission, unless the nanny faction wins out in D.C. and\r\ncracks down on the Net—may be online in the next year or two. What\r\nhappens when unpopular political beliefs spread around this way? Will\r\nthe Oklahoma City tragedy be invoked to squelch RealAudio and\r\nequivalents?\r\n\r\nCheerier possibilities may arise. Someday you might go hiking in the\r\nmiddle of the Rockies and be able to tune in performances and talk shows\r\nfrom all over the world through a net.satellite link; never mind the\r\nlimits of the local radio stations.\r\n\r\nEven video transmission will be routine over the Net or a successor. And\r\nthen what? When Michael Moriarty, a TV actor, appeared in a public Q & A\r\nsession on Prodigy, the possibilities made him wonder if network\r\ntelevision would go the way of vinyl records. “Television,” he told the\r\n_New York Times_, “might become the 33-1/3 of the visual arts.”\r\n\r\nFor the moment, however, the Net is Fan Central for television along\r\nwith other media. David Letterman fans and those of Jay Leno debate the\r\nmerits of their favorite talk show hosts, while major movie studios\r\npreview their megahits with video clips. Elvis is alive and well in an\r\narea on the Web. And just when we Netfolks are ridiculing the TV moguls’\r\ndream of 500 channels of _Terminator_ movies, Hollywood has used our Net\r\nto ballyhoo _Junior_—a comedy starring the Terminator himself, Arnold\r\nSchwarzenegger. As if that isn’t enough, Hollywood has just released\r\n_The Net_, a thriller with some evil techies; let’s see what the\r\nmarketers will post on the Web to push _that_ one. Lower on the show\r\nbusiness hierarchy, you can find model Danielle Ash replying to\r\nquestions, in alt.sex.breasts, about her double Fs.\r\n\r\nNetfolks with more elevated tastes can dial up the WebMuseum, Paris, or\r\ncheck out the works of new digital artists from Boston or New York or\r\ndozens of other big cities. Obviously the Net isn’t the same as\r\nbeholding a Rembrandt in Holland and gazing into the face of a local man\r\nor woman a few feet away. That’s screamingly clear. Stoll, the near\r\nSnubbite, correctly notes that “Rembrandt painted real people—their\r\nfacial features and mannerisms live on today in the Dutch population.\r\nDressed in period costumes, I’ll bet the security guard with his war\r\nmedals and the young woman tour guide would look as if they stepped out\r\nof one of those incredibly detailed paintings.” Moving and true.\r\nImagine, however, the benefits of the WebMuseum to people without the\r\nSnubbites’ ability to jet to Amsterdam or Paris. What’s more, the Web\r\nbrings its own glories to compensate; I can view Artist X’s work, then\r\ncall up text about the person or the times; if anything the Web can\r\nprovide _more_ context than do the skimpy handouts available at most\r\nmuseums.\r\n\r\nCaviling away, Stoll also objects that computers can’t reproduce the art\r\nexactly. But colors and resolution will just keep improving. The\r\nSnubbites who rant about lost details remind me of the foes of\r\nelectronic books; incorrectly, given the ease of digitizing everything,\r\nthe foes worry that new technology could kill off distinctive\r\ntype-faces. But we shouldn’t preserve art and literature just by\r\nattending to the detail work. Culture also needs a place in the public\r\nmind; da Vinci-class art should be free, or close to it, by way of the\r\nNet. That is surely the ethos of Nicholas Pioch. An ex-Microsoft intern\r\nnow studying economics in his native France, he is behind the WebMuseum,\r\nParis, the new name it bears, now that bureaucrats won’t let him say,\r\n“Le WebLouvre.”\r\n\r\nWithin Le WebLouvre—there, I’ll say it anyway—I saw such da Vincis as\r\n_Mona Lisa_ and _Virgin and Child with the Infant John the Baptist and\r\nSt. Anne_. I went on to look at Rembrandts, van Goghs, Cezannes, Dalis,\r\nKlees, and Manets, among others, and to read two warnings. “If you think\r\nthe law prevents you from viewing these exhibits, you should stop now\r\nand do something more interesting, such as flying to Paris and touring\r\nlive!” Pioch wrote. “Some companies may be trying to get a monopolistic\r\ngrab on arts and culture,” he said elsewhere, “developing a pay-per-view\r\nlogic, shipping out CD-ROMs while trying to patent stuff which belongs\r\nto each of us: a part of _our_ human civilization and history.”\r\n\r\nHow right Pioch was. Bill Gates has just bought a notebook of Leonardo\r\nda Vinci, and let’s hope that like some of the old robber barons, Gates\r\nwill habitually share his acquisitions with the world. But a major\r\ndifference shows up here. Andrew Carnegie and the rest did not make\r\ntheir money off art and entertainment, part of Gates’ master plan. For\r\nBill Gates to give away great paintings and manuscripts will be like\r\nCarnegie giving away steel. His motives may be the most ethereal, and\r\nwith a $10-billion net worth, he can afford many a donation; but a\r\nconflict will forever arise between Gates the businessman and Gates the\r\nphilanthropist. Just which side will prevail when he dies? If not in\r\nlife, then in death, by way of his lawyers, will he have the decency to\r\nturn _all_ his old masters loose on the Net for free viewing? No\r\njudgments here. Perhaps that day will come. He has already agreed to\r\nloan the notebook to a museum.\r\n\r\nOld masters, of course, are far from the only Culture on the Net, and I\r\ndoubt that Bill Gates will be interested in buying some of the other\r\nkind—especially Bianca’s Smut Shack. Don’t ask me if Bianca exists. The\r\nShack’s “trolls” swear that she does. If so, maybe a good many Netfolks\r\nknow her at least slightly. They can click on a picture to flit from\r\nroom to room of her virtual apartment on the Web, leave notes on the\r\nwalls of her virtual bathroom, enter her virtual music room to take in\r\nthe latest jazz or rock, or engage virtually in sex acts with strangers\r\nin Argentina or Brazil or San Francisco or wherever else hormones fuel\r\ntechnology.\r\n\r\nBianca’s proud trolls have not sold out their mascot; the virtual Bianca\r\nlives on the Web for fun, not direct money making. But sooner or later,\r\nelsewhere on the Net, if this has not happened already, an ad agency\r\nwill create a fictitious character who buys CDs, foods, books, video\r\ntapes, automobiles, and other products only from hidden “sponsors”—not\r\nopen, MCI-style ones (as described in chapter 2). I’ll hope that day is\r\nfar off. The FCC has had problems enough regulating children’s TV;\r\nimagine what could happen if supposedly educational areas knuckled under\r\nto Madison Avenue. I’m not sure if laws are the solution here, but it\r\nwould behoove Net providers to come up _now_ with rules against that\r\nsort of thing.\r\n\r\nIn the fun areas of the Net, other dangers lurk for the vulnerable.\r\nMillions of Netfolks enjoy role-playing in imaginary worlds known as\r\nMulti-User Dungeons, where they can be knights or damsels, regardless of\r\ngender—sometimes men assume women’s roles to win more attention. At the\r\nrisk of sounding like Stoll and the Snubbites, I have mixed feelings\r\nabout the worth of MUD-style diversions.\r\n\r\nA real potential exists for cocaine-heavy addiction—far more than just\r\nregular Netsurfing, where you’re not competing to rescue a fair maiden\r\nor dodge alien attacks. Stories circulate of role-players who have\r\nkissed off good grades and careers. Up in Canada, one player got so\r\nwrapped up in his game that my researcher found him amid wall-to-wall\r\ntrash as he struggled to balance his schoolwork and role-playing.\r\n\r\nJust like online groups for depressed people, however, MUDs and similar\r\nareas can bring shy Netfolks together face to face. I heard of several\r\nromances, in fact, that the games led to. Risks notwithstanding, games\r\ndo more good than harm if players just know when to quit. Like it or\r\nnot, among millions of Netfolks, MUDs and cousins are as much a part of\r\nthe Internet as the Web and @ signs.\r\n\r\nOf all the entertainment on the Net, however, the musical and video\r\nkinds could most intrigue the masses as the technology takes off; with\r\njust a modem, a reasonably powerful computer, and a $100 sound card, you\r\ncan hear the offerings of IUMA and similar areas. You don’t even need\r\nprograms such as Mosaic or Netscape if you know what you’re doing.\r\nPeople with cheapie dial-up connections and no frills software can\r\ndownload rock albums and the rest. Granted, the technology as a whole\r\ncould be better, and even using IUMA can tax the wallets and patience of\r\nsome. In most cases you’ll spend more time downloading the music—from a\r\nremote machine to your own—than you will hearing it. Fidelity on some\r\nsetups may be just this side of a tin can. But that’s now. Wait.\r\n\r\nTransmissions in the future will zip along through cable TV connections\r\nto the Internet, or through ISDN[3.1] phone connections. Then you’ll\r\ntruly be able to use the Net as a jukebox and _hear_ what you click on\r\nwith your mouse. What’s more, even now, with the right software, you can\r\nenjoy almost CD-ROM-quality fidelity from areas such as IUMA. Audio was\r\nthe next step up after text, of course, and, yes, video is on the way.\r\nTechies already have mounted gigabyte after gigabyte of amateur videos\r\non the Net. Sooner or later, directors of little films will enjoy a\r\nmonster-sized IUMA-style archive. Perhaps Rob Lord and Jeff Patterson,\r\nthose co-czars of IUMA, will run _it_, too.\r\n\r\nIf you think that the $10-billion-a-year recording industry is a little\r\nnervous, you’re right. In early 1994 Lord told the _San Jose Mercury\r\nNews_: “We want to kill the record companies.” He and Patterson have\r\nbacked off since then; they’ve even helped Warner and other giants set\r\nup Net areas of their own. IUMA’s own 500-act selection is pathetic\r\ncompared to those at the largest record stores. Still, think about the\r\nlong run: The IUMA model just might jeopardize the seven-digit salaries\r\nof top recording executives. After all, if the Net can advertise music\r\nand even be used to take orders—perhaps with electronic forms—just what\r\nbecomes of the big studios? They themselves will sell music directly\r\nover the Net, but with heavy competition.\r\n\r\nThe bypass-the-middle-man idea could apply in other ways. What about\r\nradio hosts, for example? Suppose they can reach people all over the\r\nworld through the Internet, and perhaps ultimately through wireless\r\nconnections based on the Net. Will they need CBS or NBC or ABC or\r\nequivalents as much as they do now? I can already download snippets\r\nfrom, say, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Too, just what will be\r\nthe fate of art dealers if so much of art goes digital and people can\r\ndiscover artists on their own without leaving their living rooms?\r\nPublishers of newspapers, magazines, and books, of course, are in a\r\nquandary—see the next chapter on electronic publishing.\r\n\r\nIn some ways I don’t envy the big guys. IUMA is clearly wired into the\r\nInternet, while companies such as CBS, at least at this point, are\r\nfumbling in some respects. Many of the amateurs on the Net are actually\r\ncoming up with better offerings than are the professionals. When I\r\ndropped by, the official Letterman page on the WWW was far from an\r\nabomination, and yet at the same time it showed the problems here.\r\n\r\nThe page indeed was full of odds and ends about how to get _Late Show_\r\ntickets, Letterman’s upcoming guests, his top-ten lists (the one for the\r\nApril 13th broadcast was on “Ways CBS Can Raise Money,” with number one\r\nbeing “A two-hour paycheck freeze on Letterman”), and the rest. But\r\nwhere were the connections with the rest of the Net, especially the many\r\nLetterman fans out there? How about the fans’ Letterman pages? Or\r\nrelevant mailing lists or newsgroups? Perhaps they were there but\r\nhidden, but whatever the case the cyberspace Letterman was less hip than\r\nthe one on The Box.\r\n\r\nTo Letterman’s credit, he didn’t fake things. He publicly confessed he\r\nwas ignorant of data ways. But in my opinion, his Web people could have\r\ndone better.\r\n\r\nMoving on to the CBS home page, I saw an offer for me to “Join the EYE\r\nON THE NET club. That way we can send you more information about CBS and\r\nits programs. You can also take part in special previews and other\r\ninteractive events. Fill out the following registration form and we’ll\r\ngive you a special CBS screen saver just for joining.” Oh, boy, that was\r\njust why I was on the Internet—to end up on marketers’ lists. I didn’t\r\nblame CBS for trying; some of Letterman’s fans would like the free\r\nsoftware. But surely the network could have done better.\r\n\r\nAaron Barnhart, who put out a good little electronic fan newsletter\r\ncalled _Late Show News_, defended Dave’s people on the Net. “I think\r\nit’s great,” he said of the official Letterman area. “All of these large\r\nentities are trying their best to integrate with the interactive age. A\r\nlot of e-mail gets passed that you never see, so don’t assume that just\r\nbecause there aren’t any bulletin boards ... there is no interaction\r\nhappening.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps he was being kind to his sources for his newsletter—I hadn’t any\r\nidea. What was clear was that he’d made a second career of Lettermandom.\r\nHe devoted twenty to thirty hours a week to Letterman-related\r\nactivities. Much of his newsletter was a review of reviews (“Frank Rich\r\nof the _New York Times_ wrote one of his standard pitiless columns last\r\nweek on the Oscars broadcast, and we quote, ‘in which the belly-flopping\r\nDavid Letterman demonstrated just how large a bullet he dodged by not\r\nmoving his own show to L.A.’”). Barnhart also served as owner of the Top\r\n10 List (“60,000 subscribers and booming”).\r\n\r\nSo what was Barnhart in it for? He was freelancing for the _Village\r\nVoice_, and I could see where some attention might do any writer’s\r\ncareer good, but if Barnhart even wanted to be on _The Late Show_\r\nitself, he did a pretty good job of concealing that. “Attention is\r\ngreat,” he said, “but it doesn’t pay the rent.” Did he send stuff into\r\nthe show? “No.” So why was Letterman so popular on the Net?\r\n“Demographics.” Well-off computer owners just liked that kind of\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nI checked out the Letterman page maintained by Jason A. Lindquist, an\r\nelectronic engineering student at the University of Illinois,\r\nChampaign-Urbana, a self-described “Statistician, Smart-Ass-for-Hire,\r\nand Mac Programmer.” I found references to newsgroup postings on such\r\nitems as “Dave instigates the feud with Bryant Gumbel with these words,”\r\n“The great Stevie Nicks controversy of 1986,” “Madonna—Your first choice\r\nto date your son,” and “No inside stuff on the strong guy or the fat guy\r\nhere.” And I saw mentions of the newsletter, the Frequently Asked\r\nQuestions List, and at least two Letterman-related newsgroups. CBS ought\r\nto hire this guy.\r\n\r\nIt was time to move on to alt.fans.letterman. I did a search within\r\nNetscape for the word “Leno” in the subject header and found a post from\r\nan apparent Leno fan on the attack: “Everyone knows that Jay Leno is way\r\nbetter than ugly gap-tooth Dave!”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” replied one of the faithful, “you say that Jay Leno is still on\r\nthe air? Is it true that they use a wide-angle lens to photograph that\r\nlantern jaw of his? Just wondering.”\r\n\r\n“Letterman has more comedy in his little pinkie toe than Leno will have\r\nin his wildest dreams,” said another Davite, “and if Letterman is so\r\nugly, who has all the models and top actresses flirting with him and\r\nasking him to go out—it certainly isn’t Leno.”\r\n\r\n_That_, not the official Letterman area, was the true Net. Just what\r\nmight await the world if the inmates actually ran the asylum and\r\nthemselves mounted a major entertainment effort rather than trusting the\r\ncorporate world. It had happened with the Internet Underground Music\r\nArchives, and I liked the results.\r\n\r\nIUMA\r\n\r\nThe normal story is that IUMA began when Rob Lord and Jeff Patterson,\r\nthe co-czars, met in a newsgroup devoted to supermodels. Both liked Kate\r\nMoss, a waify Calvin Klein woman; strutting down the runways, she was\r\nlost amid the big, bosomy knockouts favored by so many young men on the\r\nNet. It turned out that Lord and Patterson were both from Valencia,\r\nCalifornia, a far-north suburb of Los Angeles. They knew each other\r\nslightly from William Hart High School, both had worked in record stores\r\nwhile teenagers, and both had both been attending the University of\r\nCalifornia at Santa Cruz. That’s the story, and it’s true.\r\n\r\nIUMA, however, in another way, may have started not on the Net but in\r\nthe corporeal United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThousand and thousands of Brits were dancing to synthesized _bleeps_,\r\n_conks_, _cooonkks_, _clunks_, _bomb-bombs_ and _tssss-tsss-tssses_, and\r\nodds and ends that I could never even come close to reproducing here.\r\nThe name of the music was Rave, as in “raving mad,” and by the time Lord\r\nwas in high school in the 1980s, the craze had found its way to Los\r\nAngeles.\r\n\r\nMiddle-class white suburbanites, Latinos, Blacks, they were all\r\n_bleep_ing and _conk_ing together, thousands of them, risking the wrath\r\nof the fire department, overcrowding the halls, going at it from 11 P.M.\r\non, some dancing twelve hours on into the morning.\r\n\r\n“No place in Los Angeles,” Lord said of the Rave halls, “had such a\r\npeaceful coexistence as between these three groups. They didn’t say\r\nanything. They shared the beats and feelings and the technology. And on\r\nthe Rave scene, the person in charge is the DJ, and they’re sort of the\r\ncultural funnel. The DJs were in charge of finding these odd records\r\nthat would come from Belgium and from the UK and from Chicago, and there\r\nwere some made-in-Los Angeles things. They were hard to find, but the\r\nDJs were responsible for scouting them out and bringing the very latest\r\n_bleeps_ and _conks_ together.”\r\n\r\n“So,” I asked, thinking of IUMA and Lord’s chance to bring the world to\r\nhis listeners, “you liken yourself to those DJs?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, yeah!” Lord said enthusiastically. “I believe IUMA is my personal\r\nimplementation of Rave’s calling. I just love working with technology\r\nand all those kinds of things, and what Rave culture espoused was that\r\nthere’s a new revolution going on, an information revolution. You know,\r\none of the biggest stars of Rave music was a band called Dee-Lite. And\r\none of the first lines was, ‘From New York City in the age of\r\ncommunication.’ And that means all kinds of communications, a shrinking\r\nworld, Internet, it means ideas and the convergence of ideas.”\r\n\r\nReturning to the subject of his younger days, Rob Lord told me how\r\nmuch he hated the Depeche Mode music that was so popular in\r\nupper-middle-class neighborhoods like his—the kind the record stores\r\nwere selling. He wanted his music from the clubs, from the 100-copy\r\npressing, not from the megaconglomerates offering the likes of\r\nDepeche. “The lyrics were terrible, and the emotions were feigned.”\r\nI’m sure Depeche fans might disagree. The point, however, was that\r\nDepeche music was much more readily available at record stores than\r\nRave was, and Rob grew unhappy with the distribution system.\r\n\r\nJeff Patterson, working at a music store, just like Rob Lord, was\r\nequally disgusted. Patterson and co-workers “would sit there and talk\r\nabout who’s making all the money.” CDs cost $15-$17 at Music Plus, his\r\nemployer. Elsewhere they were around $12-$13. “And you know, we were\r\nthinking like, ‘Where is that extra $4 being pocketed?’ You know, after\r\nall the costs were taken out, then their manager would get paid, the\r\nrecord company would get paid, people on the tour would get paid, and\r\nthen the band would finally get some money after all that, and it was\r\nusually a very small check. So the artists that were actually continuing\r\nto be artists were the artists that were making money; so it was, like,\r\nthis level of superstardom that was consistent and the barriers of entry\r\nwere extremely high.”\r\n\r\nThat was true in all kinds of creative endeavors, especially in writing.\r\nI myself was amused when lobbyists representing industries such as music\r\nand publishing would rant on and on about the need for “creative\r\nincentives.” If business people at the megaconglomerates really\r\nunderstood incentives, they would cut out their caviar, sell off the\r\nexecutive jets, and spend more than a modicum on garden-variety\r\nartists—not just the Mailers and Madonnas. When, even as a teenager,\r\nJeff Patterson started asking where the money was going, he was laying\r\nsome of the more important underpinnings for IUMA.\r\n\r\nAn “A” student who would later graduate near the top of his class,\r\nPatterson wrote a school paper on another major issue: censorship. Back\r\nin the 1980s, Tipper Gore, Al’s wife, had helped start a group called\r\nthe Parents Music Resource Center, which wanted to rate music and keep\r\nthe more nefarious offerings out of the hands and CD players of young\r\npeople. “I was a big fan of Frank Zappa and he was basically taking it\r\nupon himself to challenge the PMRC.” The Senate held hearings. And\r\nPatterson recalled that PMRC deemed a Zappa recording, “Jazz from Hell,”\r\nto be sinful. The album lacked lyrics and the cover just showed Zappa’s\r\nface. “It was obvious,” Patterson said of Tipper’s group, “that they\r\nweren’t actually listening to the content or caring what it was. They\r\njust kind of labeled some artists as being bad, and therefore were\r\ntrying to prevent stores from selling many albums.” I asked if that made\r\nPatterson think later on, “Let’s go on the Net so we don’t have those\r\nbozos to worry about.” “Yeah, yeah. That actually had a big part in it.”\r\n\r\nFrom the start, it was clear that Patterson’s own music wouldn’t exactly\r\nplease the conventional. In high school he played guitar in speed metal\r\nbands, which are “usually a lot faster, a lot more angry sounding” than\r\nheavy metal. When the Ugly Mugs found each other at William Hart High,\r\nPatterson rejoiced in his friends’ weirdness. The style in this case was\r\nDada, a form of random art.\r\n\r\n“Who cared if anyone liked listening to it,” Patterson said. “We just\r\nwanted to play it. We were using mainly guitar and keyboards and bass.\r\nHowever, we wouldn’t always play them in the normal standard ways. Like,\r\nwe’d use guitar for percussion or something, and we had also used a\r\nvacuum cleaner and things like that. A lot of times we just recorded\r\nsounds of things that were just laying around.” Their big gig was at an\r\ninterpretative dancing class at a community college where teacher and\r\nstudents loved Dada-style mime.\r\n\r\nThe Ugly Mugs was a life, not just a band. Except for an Egyptian\r\nguitarist, whose hair stubbornly kept turning into an Afro when he let\r\nit grow, all the Mugs sported long locks. In a dark, ratty,\r\nposter-ridden room, they would talk politics and philosophy, standard\r\nteenage fashion.\r\n\r\nLord ended up at the University of California at Santa Cruz, and\r\nPatterson himself went on to the University of California at Berkeley,\r\nwhere he studied computers, his fallback field. He had made music on\r\nthem in high school, and, in fact, at Berkeley. “I started changing my\r\nmajor to be a combination of music and computers. Two years into it I\r\nreally got frustrated with the high pressure and decided to transfer to\r\nU.C. Santa Cruz. It’s right on the beach, a laid-back community.\r\nEveryone drives, like, five miles under the speed limit.” Beyond that,\r\nmembers of the Ugly Mugs had moved there, and in Patterson’s opinion,\r\nthe school itself was “really great.”\r\n\r\nDavid Huffman taught there. In a certain niche of computerdom, Huffman\r\nwas famous as the creator of Huffman coding, a compression routine that\r\nsoftware products such as Stacker use to double the space available on\r\nhard drives. Music isn’t exactly a low-bandwidth use of the Net.\r\nCompression routines of one kind or another are de rigueur for the\r\ntransmission of high-quality sound—not just because of the space that\r\nthe material requires, but also because big files take longer to\r\ntransmit.\r\n\r\nAt the time Patterson moved to Santa Cruz, he wasn’t using Hoffman\r\ncompression on the Net or posting CD-quality sound from hundreds of\r\nmusicians through an IUMA-style operation. But like other techies, he\r\nwas posting files in the synthesized MIDI format. “The stuff I put up\r\nthere, it sounded like a bad Casio keyboard playing our songs. It really\r\nwasn’t very representative at all. I’d just sit there at my computer,\r\ncompose ’em on the computer, and upload ’em on the Net. I posted them to\r\na couple of news groups, like alt.binaries.sound and things like that\r\nand basically got no response at all.”\r\n\r\nJeff Patterson was reading the supermodel newsgroup when he saw a\r\nposting from Rob Lord in favor of Kate Moss, the model that so many of\r\nthe regulars considered too bony. Patterson replied. “We were both huge\r\nKate Moss fans.” Lord sent him some e-mail talking about how Kate Moss\r\nshould be the “queen of supermodels.” People on the Net have a custom of\r\nleaving “signatures” at the bottom of messages—places where they may\r\npost their address or phone number, or an I-don’t-speak-for-IBM\r\ndisclaimer, or quote somebody to support them or deride them—and\r\nPatterson took quick notice of Lord’s “.sig.” It alluded to “MPEG Audio\r\nCompression, 16 to 1 CD Quality.”\r\n\r\n“And,” Patterson recalled, “I was like, ‘Wow, what’s that?’ So I\r\ne-mailed him back talking about getting together some Moss pictures, and\r\nin passing I asked him about MPEG compression.” MPEG stood for Motion\r\nPicture Expert Group—engineers who set standards for audio and video\r\ncompression. Growing curious, Patterson downloaded software so he could\r\nplay MPEG through his sound card. The results delighted him, and he\r\nspread the news to the other Ugly Mugs. Hey, guys, Patterson said in\r\neffect, what if we put our music on the Internet? “They thought it was a\r\npretty good idea. So we decided to chip in together and go ahead and buy\r\nthe software that we needed to compress MPEG files, because you could\r\nget that player for free, but the compressor cost $100. Rob came over to\r\nmy house, and I told him we were putting our band on the Net, and he was\r\nall excited about the whole idea of creating this archive of bands on\r\nthe Net.“ But of course! Rave-think could reach cyberspace.\r\n\r\nSomething was evident here, something obvious to me, but perhaps not to\r\nall the bluenoses and prudish, power-fixated bureaucrats. Patterson and\r\nLord were proving the old wisdom that hormones could drive technology on\r\nthe Net, or at least the applied variety.\r\n\r\nThe wizardry of MPEG would be useless if people didn’t use it. And it\r\ntook a meeting of Patterson and Lord in the supermodel group—not one\r\ndevoted to Bible study, or to paeans to Bill Clinton or Al Gore, or to\r\nthe mandarins of Singapore—for IUMA to give MPEG one of its biggest\r\nboosts on the Net. Why, horror of horrors, Patterson and Lord just may\r\nhave wanted to scan and swap _copyrighted_ photos of Kate Moss. One way\r\nor another MPEG would become important on the Net, but thanks to people\r\nlike these two, it was happening far faster than it would have\r\notherwise. Technology was at odds with the vested interests of record\r\ncompanies, and they knew it.\r\n\r\nAt around the same time IUMA was getting under way in fall 1993,\r\nlobbyists for the companies and performing artists were fighting for\r\nlaws that could lead to onerous pay-per-listen schemes—while publishers\r\nwere trying to lay the basis for pay-per-read. Indeed, business people\r\nand creators should receive fair compensation, especially the creators;\r\nbut in the zeal to protect major political contributors from the\r\nentertainment industry, bureaucrats and lawyers could imperil technology\r\nin the most lethal of ways. Bruce Lehman, Bill Clinton’s intellectual\r\nproperty czar, would prove it later with a stunningly oppressive\r\nproposal called the Green Paper, a technophobic lawyer’s wetdream, a\r\ntechie’s nightmare.\r\n\r\nThe first song the Ugly Mugs put on the Net was called ”_Arbeit Macht\r\nFrei_”—German for “Work will make you free.” A punky carnival song, it\r\nsparked an instant debate on free speech.\r\n\r\nAsked about the title, Patterson told me, “It was kind of born out of\r\nour frustration of, ‘In order to have the money to do everything that we\r\nwant to do, we have to work, but if we work, we can’t do anything we\r\nwant to do.’ So it was kind of like commenting on people’s attitude of,\r\n‘If you work you’ll be able to do what you want to do,’ when actually\r\nyou won’t be able to do what you want to, because you’ll be working.\r\nActually it wasn’t a smart song title. It was a phrase that was over the\r\ngate on the way to the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland.\r\nUnfortunately, people took it to be this Nazi song, which is actually\r\ncompletely the opposite of what we meant.\r\n\r\n“We got responses from people who flamed me because they thought it was\r\nextremely cruel to be using this as a name for a song and taking it all\r\nlighthearted when it actually meant something serious to a lot of\r\npeople. Whenever anyone actually wrote to me, I usually sent them back\r\nthe lyrics and explained our stance, why it was called that. It\r\ndefinitely created enough of a stir among the few people who heard it.\r\nYou wonder if a label would ever take a chance with something like\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\nOn the Net, however, “_Arbeit Macht Frei_” would find its audience. A\r\nman from Turkey asked for a full demo tape—unavailable—and more songs.\r\nOther Netfolks wrote in from Texas, Florida, and elsewhere in the\r\nStates, some of whom said more or less: “You know, wow, I’m a Zappa fan\r\nand I can hear the influence. It’s pretty cool.” The Net, in character,\r\nwas blurring distinctions between artists and fans and helping the two\r\ngroups mix. “We realized we had something,” Patterson told me. “Like,\r\n‘Jeez, we got these responses to a band that had never played anywhere\r\nand didn’t have a tape out.’ So we started grabbing a couple of our\r\nfriends’ bands—like my roommate’s. And we put Rob’s roommate’s band up\r\nthere, and we just kind of kept grabbing bands to put up. And slowly\r\neveryone was getting one or two responses to what they had posted. And\r\nwe needed a place to actually keep all this music. There were like four\r\nbands maybe at that time.”\r\n\r\nPatterson, however, quickly filled up all the disk space available to\r\nhim at his commercial Internet provider, Netcom; so he and Lord\r\ncontacted their university and asked if they could store the music\r\nthere. “Well, it turned out that the guy who was in charge of running\r\nthe FTP site was a musician—he was in four bands—and he said, ‘Sure, go\r\nfor it.’ And we put his four bands up there.”\r\n\r\nThe technology would have seemed infuriatingly hard to the world at\r\nlarge. You couldn’t just hook into the World Wide Web, point and click\r\nyour way to the IUMA archives, and choose the song you wanted; no, you\r\nhad to do FTP, short for File Transfer Protocol, threading your way\r\nthrough the big hard drives at Santa Cruz, until you reached the\r\nsubdirectory with the music. And then, with most software, you had to\r\ntype out the file names. Patterson and Lord didn’t even start out with\r\npostings on Gopher (which, to be grossly simplistic, is a more primitive\r\nversion of the Web).\r\n\r\nEven back then, however, the two were thinking about the Net equivalent\r\nof album covers or of the J cards that record companies used to tout\r\ncassettes. In other words they didn’t just post files of sound alone.\r\nThey also pondered the use of files with pictures that music fans could\r\ndownload.\r\n\r\n“At this point,” Patterson said, “it was still just a fun project. We\r\ndidn’t think about making it a money-making venture at that point. We\r\nwere just like, you know, ‘Let’s put bands up and see what we can do to\r\nmess with the record industry.’ We had this attitude like, ‘We’ll cut\r\nout waste in the industry.’ At that time there was, like, no press about\r\nus, so we weren’t really vocal, but we had those attitudes. We were kind\r\nof like naive and rebellious.”\r\n\r\nThen an event happened that was almost as significant to IUMA as was the\r\ndiscovery of MPEG. Lord discovered the World Wide Web. “None of us,”\r\nPatterson recalled, “had any clue what it was. I think it was in\r\nDecember of ’93 that we got a hold of a copy of Mosaic.” They tried it\r\nout in a faculty lounge at U.C. Santa Cruz. “There wasn’t really much\r\ncontent on the Web at all. It was pretty much, like, weather satellites.\r\nWe realized from that point on that we could really do something with\r\ntaking the music and the pictures and using the World Wide Web as the\r\nway to present everything. People would be able to look at the album\r\ncover, read the text, see ‘play’ buttons. You know, press the play\r\nbutton, hear the music, and all that sort of thing.\r\n\r\n“So,” Patterson said, “we called up the guy we knew from maintaining the\r\nFTP archives at U.C. Santa Cruz, and asked him what he knew about the\r\nWorld Wide Web.” Overnight he learned how to set IUMA up on the Web. His\r\nname was Jon Luini, and he would become a partner in IUMA, the co-czars’\r\n“Kaiser.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile IUMA’s popularity kept growing, and soon the archives landed\r\non SunSite UNC, a big digital library sponsored by Sun Micro Systems at\r\nthe University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. IUMA would even make it\r\nto servers in Europe, so that people there could enjoy the music without\r\ntying up the trans-Atlantic connections. Other big companies, such as\r\nSilicon Graphics, took an interest in IUMA and donated computers and\r\nother gear.\r\n\r\nBut how were Patterson and Lord—and their musicians—going to make money\r\noff the Internet, where “free” was a religion and where commercial audio\r\nmight be pirated? I loved the many legitimately free pleasures of the\r\nNet. It was truly for sharing. IUMA, of course, was offering lots of\r\nmusic at no charge. Via the World Wide Web, I myself was giving away a\r\nbook chapter I’d written for a forthcoming information science\r\ncollection; and I hoped that at least some material from _NetWorld!_\r\nwould be retrievable without any money changing hands. But what to do\r\nabout the darker side of “free?”\r\n\r\nSympathetic to the cash-short but clearly a realist, Lord told how\r\ncasually kids copied computer games for each other. “There’s a complete\r\nunderground going on,” he said, and he told how young hackers had\r\nsecretly turned the IUMA archives into a site for stolen software. The\r\nmischief was hard to spot just by doing the usual check of the storage\r\narea.\r\n\r\n“We deleted their stuff,” Lord recalled, “and left a note saying, ‘Leave\r\nus alone, you Rug Rats,’ because it was clear there were 13-year-olds\r\ndoing it. Some of the biggest pirates in the world are younger than 15.”\r\n\r\nHis words rang true. Adolescents in the States were no match for the\r\nbest pros abroad, but the teenaged pirates could still be awesomely well\r\norganized. One group of teens might crack the software. Another group\r\nmight craft a slick screen telling who had defeated the protection. Lord\r\ntold of a 13-year-old making $24,000 a year writing and selling\r\nshareware; and although the business was legitimate, this example showed\r\nthe energy and brains out there among the young—in other words, the\r\ndifficulty of fighting rip-offs.\r\n\r\nLord and Patterson were thinking about releasing IUMA offerings with\r\ndigital identifiers that would make it easier to track down thieves. And\r\nyet another tack could be to design the music files that you could play\r\nonly with the right digital keys. IUMA’s owners were of GenNet; they\r\nwere more interested in relying on technology than law to thwart\r\npirates.\r\n\r\nPiracy is one reason why major record companies feel uneasy about the\r\nInternet. Unable to ignore so large a market, they want help in getting\r\ntheir message across to the strange, young denizens. Warner paid IUMA to\r\nput short samples of music online, along with pictures and information\r\nabout the artists. It was similar to what Patterson and Lord were doing\r\nalready.\r\n\r\nNow, however, like many others, the two were looking ahead to new\r\nbusiness models. Lord had a bunch of possibilities in mind.\r\n\r\nOne was that people would pay if they liked what they heard, and maybe\r\neven give in advance. Another was that they would receive little\r\ngifts——maybe clay cats?——for making donations.\r\n\r\nPatterson, however, offered some models that were more conventional.\r\nGasp, his comments even sounded like an actual business plan.\r\n\r\nFirst, he said, he and Lord would take orders for CDs and tapes online\r\nfor companies such as Tower Records. Then IUMA would go the next step.\r\nIt would sell files of music electronically. Fans would be able to use\r\nWeb browsers like Netscape to encrypt credit card numbers so hackers\r\ncouldn’t intercept them. Eventually IUMA would sell music for instant\r\nlistening without customers first having to transfer it to their hard\r\ndisks. “There could be some kind of royalty treatment,” Patterson said.\r\n“You might pay two cents every time you listened to a song. Or you could\r\njust buy an album.” Some good possibilities existed here as long as no\r\none gouged. If people could hear music with just a tiny investment up\r\nfront, that might benefit new performers.\r\n\r\nMore immediately, IUMA was helping fledgling musicians and others by way\r\nof an informal support network. Sue Few, a Santa Cruz woman who’d\r\nformerly worked for record companies, went online with a newsletter\r\ncalled _Sound Check_ and offered a stream of tips on subjects such as\r\ncopyright law, musicians’ unions, royalties, and lining up bookings.\r\n“Booking people aren’t so bad, are they?” she wrote. “If they enjoy your\r\ntape and feel you’ll fit well with their customers, you’ll get\r\nbooked—simple as that. So they don’t return your telephone calls—keep\r\ncalling until you talk to a live person and still keep calling until you\r\nget an answer and a date from them.”\r\n\r\nIUMA itself was a calling card of sorts. Record companies and clubs\r\ncould cruise the archives looking for bands to sign up.\r\n\r\nMost important of all, however, IUMA helped potential fans and musicians\r\nget together. At the time I toured the IUMA area you could check out\r\nofferings by “Last 15 Bands” just uploaded to the archives, by artist,\r\nby label, by location, and by song title. Or you could click on a\r\ndatabase with a number of options. I myself wanted to know more about\r\nScott Brookman, who had written “When I Die You Can’t Have My Organs,”\r\nand who, as a result of IUMA, had been on National Public Radio.\r\n\r\nA digitized photo showed him to be a bearded man with glasses. Something\r\nwhite was against his face, though I couldn’t quite discern the shape. I\r\nhoped it wasn’t a stray from an anatomy lab.\r\n\r\nMessages on the screen said IUMA would let Netfolks listen to Brookman’s\r\n“Organs” in stereo or mono. I clicked on the latter option and watched\r\nthe bottom of my screen as it showed the number of bytes passing over\r\nthe wires from a computer in California to my 486DX-class machine.\r\nWithin 45 seconds I’d received a 119K file. In size it was equivalent to\r\nmaybe 60 double-spaced, typewritten pages even though this was music not\r\ntext.\r\n\r\n“When I die,” the lyrics wafted out of my stereo hooked to the 486, “you\r\ncan’t have my organs, though you think that you will need them ...” If\r\nI’d had the right software on my machine, I could have heard several\r\nminutes’ worth. The song was good even if, with my primitive sound\r\nsoftware, it wasn’t even AM in audio quality. My rather untrained ears\r\npicked up a Loudon Wainwright-ish edge to the music. I made a mental\r\nnote to myself. When I was off my book deadline, I’d do what I should\r\nhave done in the first place and install the MPEG software whose\r\nexistence had helped make IUMA possible. I had heard only a little cut\r\nin another format With MPEG I could have enjoyed three minutes’ worth,\r\nand in better fidelity.\r\n\r\nIn the IUMA area Brookman said, “Organs” was “from my latest cassette\r\nrelease, ‘They’ll Nickel and Dime You to Death.’” He thought of his\r\nmusic “as a bizarre mix of stylistic parody, satire, self-referential,\r\nand meta-songs, full of clever guitar riffs and daring vocal harmonies.\r\nI write about personal heroes, local history, teenage memories, bits of\r\nfolklore, and sometimes I make fun of rock music (lovingly, of course).\r\nUsually the result is intentionally funny ...”\r\n\r\nBrookman’s inevitable pitch for money was reasonable enough. “I hope you\r\nenjoy the song, and I really think you should get yourself a copy of\r\n‘They’ll Nickel and Dime You to Death.’ Send a check for five bucks (no\r\ncharge cards) made payable to Loser Records. That’s a full 60 minutes of\r\nawesome music for only $5. Where else, other than a used record store,\r\ncan you find that kind of entertainment bargain? Here’s our address:\r\nLoser Records, P.O. Box 14719, Richmond, Virginia 23221.” Hey, I’d\r\nalready enjoyed a bargain, his delightful little fan area. I would\r\nremember the name Brookman.\r\n\r\nPeople could leave feedback and I brought up some. “My colleagues and I\r\nagree—what a scream!!” read a note from Virginia, where Brookman lived.\r\n“I think we’re going to track down your CD. Congrats on a nifty tune!\r\nIt’s good to hear a local band ‘make it big.’” An Australian wrote in:\r\n“Heheheheh. Nice sense of humour.” None other than Jon Luini, Raiser of\r\nIUMA, said of “Organs”: “I cannot get this song out of my head! The\r\nsincerity around this song is a great combination with the odd nature of\r\nthe lyrics, especially when combined with the folk feel of the music. It\r\nmakes me feel like it should be included whenever people first get their\r\ndriver’s license.”\r\n\r\nBrookman’s electronic mail address was online, of course, together with\r\nthose of listeners who had offered feedback. Anyone wanting to start a\r\nfan list focused on him would already have some names and e-mail\r\naddresses handy.\r\n\r\nThis was what the Net was so good for—not displaying Canteresque spam on\r\nbehalf of Green Cards or pitches from CBS to join its fan club.\r\n\r\nSmall business actually enjoyed an advantage here. To CBS, fan mail must\r\nhave been a nice a way of gauging the market. But the Brookmans of this\r\nworld could go far beyond that and establish good rapport with fans, one\r\nby one—something for which the people at the CBS site would never have\r\nhad time, given its volume. Small worked in other ways for Brookman. He\r\nor Loser Records (were they the same?) could do a short run of CDs and\r\nspread the news with minimum investment. Pressing a thousand CDs costs\r\nless than $2,000 nowadays. Combine that with the Net, and the music\r\nworld just might be a little kinder to a young performer than it was in\r\nthe days when Lord and Patterson were toiling away in the record stores\r\nback in Valencia.\r\n\r\nGranted, a place in the IUMA archives was hardly a guarantee of success.\r\nA musician with the band Black Watch told me that she and her colleagues\r\nnormally heard only from a fan or so a week. IUMA would _not_ make a\r\nband instantly rich. On the other hand, she loved the feedback and\r\nencouragement that arrived from all over the world; and, we both\r\nthought, wasn’t that important, too—not just the money? The music was\r\nfinding its way to those who loved it. Besides, in the end, all the\r\nsmall fry might add up. Lord said that instead of one Madonna there\r\nmight be fifty—“Maybe it will no longer make sense to have even\r\none.”[3.2] Perhaps, I hoped, the money instead would reach the Black\r\nWatches.\r\n\r\nOnce Lord had predicted that in several years IUMA might be “a one- or\r\ntwo-digit percentage of the $9 billion music industry.”[3.3] I didn’t\r\nknow what would happen. Major record companies would surely be doing\r\nplenty on their own. And when I talked to Lord in April 1995, IUMA’s\r\nannual revenues were still in the low six figures. But that could\r\nchange, quickly. No matter what happened, IUMA was brilliant for a\r\nniched world in which millions were rebelling against the\r\nany-color-if-it’s-black mindset.\r\n\r\nWe want just the right friends and spouse; the right home; the right\r\ncoffee; the right newsgroups, now that they existed for all; and, yes,\r\njust the right music.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe same nichization is happening in the world of publishing—the\r\nInternet is home to hundreds if not thousands of electronic\r\npublications. So what’s a hometown paper to do? Just how is _Time_\r\nmagazine responding? And in such strange times—normal times, actually,\r\nonce they’ve been around long enough—what becomes of books, especially\r\nwhen you consider the digital piracy issue. In the next chapter I’ll lay\r\nout the problems and even suggest a few solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER\r\n                                  FOUR\r\n\r\n    Pulped Wood versus\r\n    Electrons: Can the\r\n    Print World Learn to\r\n    Love the Net?\r\n\r\n\r\nI ran across A. C. Snow on the Internet the other day, and old memories\r\npoured forth.[4.1] A.C. is as low tech as they come. He writes a Tar\r\nHeelish column with jokes and stories about church picnics and football\r\nand beach trips, and yet there he was online with the folksy prose that\r\nI remembered from eons ago. The _Raleigh Times_ is gone now. A.C. works\r\ninstead for the bigger _News & Observer_, a sister newspaper that\r\nthudded against my dormitory door when I was in college. Weekday\r\ncirculation is around 150,000 nowadays, and many state legislators wake\r\nup each morning to the _N & O_—it just might be the most powerful paper\r\nin North Carolina.\r\n\r\nMillions of people on the Net, however, would question the need for the\r\nthree-story tan brick building, the fleet of delivery trucks, and the\r\nrecent decision to invest $36 million in color presses.\r\n\r\nYou can’t update the ink on pulped trees the way you can move around\r\ndots on a computer screen. “Aren’t newspapers obsolete?” scads of\r\ntechies are asking. Besides, the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area has\r\nchanged. Thousands of locals swap e-mail addresses at cocktail parties,\r\nwhile many schoolchildren grow up reading off computer screens as well\r\nas from books. IBM and other Fortune 500 companies are in Research\r\nTriangle Park outside town.\r\n\r\nStill, like the Raleigh area, the _N & O_ has evolved. In a nearby\r\nbuilding, a small crew is putting out electronic newspapers on the\r\nInternet and on a bulletin board system. This isn’t just a\r\npulp-and-ink-era newspaper company. It’s also an Internet provider.\r\nAided by two phone companies, the _N & O_ gives out free Internet\r\nservice to teachers and students to find out what the latter would like\r\nonline in the future. It’s offered Netfolks a colorful, multimedia tour\r\nof the state. Tens of thousands drop by the _N & O_ area each week. “The\r\nInternet is like the real world—unorganized, unruly, and filled with\r\nmore happenings than any one person can possibly track,” says Frank\r\nDaniels III, the paper’s executive editor. “It’s growing at a fantastic\r\nspeed, and its citizens are literate. An opportunity for editors!”[4.2]\r\n\r\nNot everyone on the print side feels as he does. When a _Washington\r\nPost_ writer did a gossipy little item on Cliff Stoll’s net.exposé, the\r\njournalist said book editors were looking forward to reviewing _Silicon\r\nSnake Oil_ as “confirmation of what they hoped was true all along.”[4.3]\r\nThat may or may not have been a joke. Whatever the case, a war is going\r\non between pulped wood and electrons. Can commercial publications, from\r\nnewspapers to book publishers, learn to love the Internet, and what does\r\nthis mean to us readers?\r\n\r\n“There is no doubt in my mind that the Net will force a transformation\r\nof newspapers,” says Peter Lewis, a cyberspace writer for the _New York\r\nTimes_, “but demise? That’s what they said about radio and television as\r\nwell.”[4.4] Just the same, a headline in _Wired_ magazine said online\r\nnewspapers “still suck.” Many newspapers are too enamored with the\r\ntraditional models where editors and writers inflict whatever they want\r\non the unsuspecting public. They don’t give their readers enough of a\r\nchance to speak back online or communicate with each other. Still, the\r\nbest electronic publications can indeed be two way. And more and more of\r\nthem will be packaged for the medium. You’ll be able to read summaries\r\nof stories, for example, and then summon up longer versions with a click\r\nof the mouse.\r\n\r\nEven ads may improve. “Think of the typical print tire ad,” says Teresa\r\nMartin, an online expert with the Knight-Ridder newspaper chain.\r\n“_Yawn._ But what if touching each tire bought up detailed specs about\r\nit, or the sizes in which the store currently has it in stock—or even\r\nsome really cool car careening around a racetrack with the voice-over\r\n‘speed rated?’ The ad can be like a window to a store, enticing the\r\nreader in to look for information.”\r\n\r\nI know—computers are too hard for many technophobes to learn, too big to\r\nuse in bed, and often too blurry or flickery to read off of; and\r\nbatteries are forever eager for their next charge. But life will get\r\nbetter. It will happen faster if governments worry less about smartening\r\nup TV sets and more about smartening up schoolchildren with programs\r\nthat drive down the cost of book-friendly computers. Much, however, is\r\nalready going on. Xerox, for example, has experimented with a computer\r\nscreen whose output is as sharp as printing on paper. It’s a power hog,\r\nbut less hungry screens are coming. Writing in _Digital Media_, Martin\r\nsays the right hardware could be a mere six years away.[4.5] I myself\r\nthink—based on my monitoring of technical publications—that her estimate\r\nis conservative.\r\n\r\nBesides, even now, electronic texts can at least complement the paper\r\nkind. For example, they can increase the variety of newspapers, books,\r\nand magazines available. After U.S. Senator Jesse Helms joked that Bill\r\nClinton would need a bodyguard to protect him from angry service people\r\nwho resented his military policies, I did not rely just on the\r\n_Washington Post_ for details. I called up the story directly from the\r\n_News & Observer_ hundreds of miles away. What’s more, it’s easy to\r\nwander from one electronic publication to others when you are after\r\nfacts on the same topic, or to search back issues of newspapers and\r\nmagazines. Even novelists are discovering the possibilities of the new\r\nmedia. Readers can choose their own endings or pass on suggestions to\r\nthe authors of works in progress.\r\n\r\nAdventurous media people are trying to adapt to this online world as\r\ngracefully as they can, and the Internet is oh so enticing to many. The\r\ncost of the technology has fallen to the point where a bare-bones\r\nnewspaper can go on the World Wide Web by investing as little as\r\n$5,000-$10,000 up front. Publishers needn’t divvy up revenue with a\r\ncommercial online service, such as America Online or CompuServe.\r\n\r\nCompared to pulped wood, the Net looks better and better—the price of\r\npaper shot up some 30 percent between the fall of 1994 and the spring of\r\n1995. Environmental regulators are forcing the pulp mills to quit\r\nsullying the air and the water, and new mills can cost half a billion\r\ndollars each to build. “Like the rest of us,” writes Jonathan Seybold,\r\npublisher of _Digital Media_, “the paper company executives read all of\r\nthe press stuff about the Information Highway, the rise of online\r\nservices, and the decline of paper-based publishing.” And he says they\r\nare now asking, “Why should we invest in a new paper mill?” The result?\r\nNewsprint shortages and higher prices. “The fear,” Seybold says,\r\n“creates its own reality.”[4.6]\r\n\r\nMore than 100 newspapers either are on the Internet or are planning to\r\nbe there. The _New York Times_, for example, has used the World Wide Web\r\nto transmit a fax edition condensed from the normal paper. A full-grown\r\n_Times_ may be on the Net now. The _San Jose Mercury News_ in California\r\nnot only is online, it offers a service called News Hound. For just $10\r\na month, the Hound will automatically scan a massive database from\r\nKnight-Ridder papers and additional dailies, then e-mail you the latest\r\narticles on the cover girls of _Sports Illustrated_, on Afghanistan, on\r\nthe Chicago Bears, on Bill Clinton, or on any other topic that quickens\r\nyour pulse or makes you reach for your Valium. From the _Halifax Daily\r\nNews_ to Poland’s _Gazeta Wyborcza_, newspapers are trying the Net. Even\r\na strike paper, published by reporters of the San Francisco _Examiner_\r\nand _Chronicle_, made it into cyberspace.\r\n\r\nSome Netfolks preferred the strike daily to the electronic spin-offs of\r\nthe regular ones, and I wasn’t surprised. What applies to business\r\napplies to newspapers: The Net is a great equalizer in some ways; a\r\nsmall newspaper can reach as far-flung a readership as an international\r\ndaily. In fact, the first paper on the World Wide Web just might have\r\nbeen the _Palo Alto Weekly_ from Silicon Valley. South Africa’s _Mail &\r\nGuardian_, a 30,000-circulation weekly, finds the Internet a much\r\ncheaper way to reach people overseas than air-mail. Devoted to Russian\r\nnews, the _St. Petersburg Press_ uses the Internet to serve an\r\nEnglish-speaking audience throughout the world. The _London Telegraph_\r\nhas shown up on the Net with some striking graphics. No longer is the\r\nInternet just for little magazines published by techies and smart young\r\nEnglish majors.\r\n\r\nTime Warner has put _Time_, _People_, _Entertainment Weekly_, and a\r\nshelf full of other magazines in a colorful, well-done area of the World\r\nWide Web. Readers can praise and flame the editors and each other.\r\nHearst magazines have their own area. _PC Magazine_, one of the giants\r\nof the Ziff-Davis chain, enraged many Netfolks with clueless articles\r\nsuggesting a rather thorough ignorance of the Internet and its reasons\r\nfor existence. But guess what. Now Ziff-Davis has a wonderful Web area\r\nwith generous samples from its magazines, including _PC_. The German\r\nnewsmagazine _Der Spiegel_ is on the World Wide Web, too, complete with\r\nsome news in English; from Japan, specialized publications serve Net\r\naudiences ranging from gays to office workers.\r\n\r\nI learned of the most dramatic use of cyberspace by a magazine just as I\r\nwas finishing this book. _Omni_, the popular science publication, said\r\nit would forsake monthly paper editions in favor of a version on America\r\nOnline, augmented by just four print editions, one each quarter. It\r\nexpected to save some $4 million a year. The newsletter _Interactive\r\nWeek Publishing Alert_ raised some valid questions—copies of back\r\narticles from _Omni_ were too hard to locate—but even if the grand\r\nexperiment failed, the model was out there. A major publication was more\r\nor less forsaking pulped wood in favor of computer networks.\r\n\r\nBook publishers are catching up with newspapers and magazines. Time\r\nWarner, Random House, Macmillan, and McGraw-Hill use the Internet for\r\npromotion, and they will distribute more and more of their books this\r\nway. Free classics like _A Tale of Two Cities_ have been a staple of the\r\nNet for years, thanks to voluntary efforts such as Project Gutenberg.\r\nAnd now you can pay a few dollars to download a short story by Stephen\r\nKing or works by many others.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, some old-fogey publishers view the Internet as an\r\nunfathomable virus transmitted via cable. That’s especially true of the\r\nbook business. People in it fear a massive bootlegging of their wares.\r\nUsing the Net, you can even pirate paper books; there is no technical\r\nreason why machines cannot scan the latest from Philip Roth or Tom\r\nClancy, convert their novels to bits and bytes, and zap them to your\r\nfriends in Juneau. Software-based copy protection could help safeguard\r\nelectronic books. But I myself think there are other solutions as\r\nwell—for example, a national library fund to make free or low-cost books\r\npractical and reduce the incentive for bootlegging.\r\n\r\nPaper publishers also complain that if electronic books are cheaper to\r\ncreate and distribute, manuscripts will receive less editing. With a\r\ngood library system in effect, however, a way would exist to highlight\r\nworks of merit—marketers would enjoy less clout and we’d see fewer\r\nbest-sellers on astrology and more on history. And without the\r\ndistribution costs, more money could go to writers and editors.\r\n\r\nOther obstacles also exist in the minds of publishers eyeing the\r\nInternet. Some worry about finding a market for text offered through a\r\nglobal network. And certain people in the book industry also dread the\r\ncompetition from the many gigabytes of free material that the Internet\r\noffers. Didn’t Samuel Johnson know best?—No one but a blockhead ever\r\nwrote except for money. If nothing else, many word people are captives\r\nof their senses. They hate reading off computer screens; they want to\r\nhear a newspaper thunk against their doors, hold Section A in their\r\nhands, hear it rattle, sniff the ink.\r\n\r\nGoing in the other direction, many people on the Internet love to bash\r\nthe print world as benighted and even a little worthless. Who needs\r\npublishers when you can post your own books and little magazines for the\r\nworld to read on the Net? That’s simplistic in many cases; I’ve got a\r\nlittle more faith in the editors at Knopf or Viking than I do in the\r\nproofreading gang from the Department of Chemistry or Joe’s Literary\r\nBar.\r\n\r\nPeople on the Net, however, are right to criticize the print media’s\r\nignorance of electronic publishing and computer networks. If nothing\r\nelse, many traditional publishers fail to grasp the potential here.\r\nLooking at the old, underpowered machines that clutter their offices,\r\nthey may believe that computers won’t progress from there. An\r\nintelligent staffer with a publishers group—someone I respected on other\r\nmatters—didn’t understand the promise of computers for reading e-books.\r\nI shared this story with Robin Peek of Simmons College, who coedited a\r\nbook on electronic publishing for the American Society for Information\r\nScience and the M.I.T. Press. She told me that many book publishers just\r\nhoped that computers wouldn’t improve until the publishers died or\r\nretired. Computers keep stubbornly getting better, though; blurry\r\nscreens and fragile hard disks won’t always be the order of day.\r\n\r\nMore amazingly, a popular magazine misinformed some of us Netfolks that\r\nwe were “netgods.” Didn’t our Internet addresses end with a prestigious\r\n“.net” rather than “.com” (the designation for a commercial site) or\r\n“.edu” (for a school site)? Strange. Anyone can pay $14 a month to\r\nClarkNet or many other services and automatically get an address like\r\nrothman@clark.net. So much for my godliness.\r\n\r\nZeuslike, however, I’ll hurl thunderbolts at HarperCollins and\r\nDoubleday. The former published the book that the immigration lawyers in\r\nArizona used to justify the off-topic ads that they had inflicted on\r\nthousands of newsgroups. The Canter and Siegel guide was in the same\r\nclass as astrology books. It talked about spending just $.0333 per\r\nthousand users per month to reach 30 million people on the Net. Most of\r\nthe people, however, can only use e-mail and aren’t on Usenet or the\r\nWeb. Doubleday erred in other ways. It let Cliff Stoll smear cyberspace\r\nas “devoid of warmth and human kindness.” Devoid? A rather\r\nall-encompassing word. In both cases the paper publishers were entering\r\nan unknown world.\r\n\r\nTo give another example, a _New Yorker_ article lamented the destruction\r\nof library catalogues without really telling how electronic libraries\r\ncould do the job better. The article went on about the handwritten\r\nannotations on the cards, and I could see the point here. Couldn’t a\r\ncard for a Civil War book include an informal recommendation for a book\r\non Antietam or Gettysburg? Must all cross-references be official? So I\r\ncould appreciate writer Nicholson Baker’s worry about the fate of those\r\nbeautiful wooden cabinets. What he played down, however, is that\r\ntechnology can let electronic librarians create quick paths from one\r\nwork to another.[4.7]\r\n\r\nFar from being exotic nowadays, this technology is the essence of the\r\nWorld Wide Web. So if you looked up a general item on the Civil War, you\r\nmight see some annotated references to an item on Antietam, and go there\r\ninstantly with a click of the mouse.\r\n\r\nJust as wrongly, an article in the _Atlantic Monthly_ of September 1994\r\nsaid future electronic books could perish because they used many disk\r\nformats. “The End of the Book?” asked the headline over T. J. Max’s\r\ndoomsaying. But CD-ROMs and books on floppy disk are just transitions.\r\nUnless legislators interfere in the most ham-handed of ways, computer\r\nnetworks should be the natural homes for electronic books. They could\r\nreach us more cheaply, and in greater varieties, without the bottleneck\r\nof physical bookstores. So disk standards should be just plain\r\nirrelevant in the end. The true raison d’etre for the Internet is its\r\nability to let many kinds of machines share information without the\r\nleast worry about floppies or magnetic tape. Most of the time I don’t\r\nknow if my no-name IBM clone is talking to a Mac or a $5-million\r\nmainframe. Besides, we mustn’t preserve books just physically; in a\r\nvideocentric era we also need to help them survive in the minds of\r\nreaders, particularly those outside the elite. We should spread books\r\nfar and wide, then, and make the technology as friendly to words as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nBut tell that to Max. In his eagerness to put down electronic text, Max\r\ndepicted the _print_ version of _Wired_ magazine as hypocritical. He\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n_Although_ Wired _communicates extensively by e-mail with its readers,\r\nconducts forums, and makes back issues available on-line, its\r\nmuch-repeated goal of creating a magazine—currently called_\r\nHotWired—_that is especially designed to exist electronically remains\r\nfuzzy. For the moment this is no open democracy, and_ Wired _is no\r\ncomputer screen—its bright graphics would make a fashion magazine\r\nenvious_. Wired _celebrates what doesn’t yet exist by exploiting a\r\nformat that does: it’s as if a scribe copied out a manuscript extolling\r\nthe beauty that would one day be print_.\r\n\r\nStrange. Just what’s so odd about using old technology to spread word of\r\nalternatives, especially the dazzling e-magazines that already enliven\r\nthe Web? When Nicholas Negroponte published _Being Digital_ (New York:\r\nKnopf, 1995), a bestselling collection of his lively _Wired_ essays,\r\nsome Generation Xers bought it not for themselves but for their\r\nparents—which was exactly what Negroponte wanted.\r\n\r\nMax is especially off target about _HotWired_. Today, just months after\r\nhe wrote of the publishers’ “fuzzy” goal, the magazine is one of the\r\nmost successful on the Net with far more than 100,000 readers. It makes\r\nmassive use of hyperlinks—the technology I described by way of the Civil\r\nWar example. Within discussion areas, readers can create links from\r\ntheir posts to text, pictures, and sound elsewhere in the World Wide\r\nWeb, including their own electronic pages—they needn’t confine\r\nthemselves to tiny letters to the editor. Simply put, _HotWired_ both\r\npraises and exemplifies the new medium.\r\n\r\nI couldn’t care less, moreover, if this electronic magazine runs long\r\narticles that have come out in print or could have—just so _HotWired_\r\nalso gives me new material. Not everyone on the Internet reads the\r\nprinted _Wired_. One of joys of the Net, moreover, is the ability to\r\noffer greater levels of detail for those wanting it. What a grouch Max\r\nis. He might as well be a monk lecturing Gutenberg about the glories of\r\ncalligraphy.\r\n\r\nEven _PC Magazine_, one of my favorites, at times can be all wet about\r\nthe Internet and related topics. A columnist suggested that most people\r\non the Net be forced to pay for each letter sent out; supposedly,\r\nNetfolks were too quick to e-mail each other. Excuse me. Such an\r\napproach could kill off many of the mailing lists through which\r\nacademics and nonacademics swap ideas and research notes en masse. A\r\nvery small fee based on actual costs and Net congestion? Maybe. But not\r\none designed to minimize use. To the columnist, however, the Net’s role\r\nas a petri dish may count less than its promise as a corporate mailman.\r\nHe misses a major point. The Internet is one of the planet’s cheapest\r\nways to transmit knowledge, including the kind that might cure cancer or\r\ngive us a 150-mpg automobile. While commerce on the Net is laudable, we\r\nneed those mailing lists as well—and not just for professors but public\r\nschools, libraries, charities, psychological support groups, and\r\nactivists of all ideologies, to name just a few of the better examples.\r\nThe economics of the Net will make this possible, especially as\r\nbandwidths increase to accommodate greater use of audio and video—text\r\njust won’t cost that much. Alas, the columnist in this instance failed\r\nto understand the Internet and its possibilities.\r\n\r\nI myself won’t claim omniscience about the Net. Once I saw a message on\r\na mailing list from someone pushing for a huge National Knowledge\r\nFoundation to benefit educators, librarians, journalists, and\r\ninvestigators. The post mentioned international topics, among others,\r\nand flares went off in my head. I posted some sharply critical,\r\njournalistic questions, wondering if the post had come from a CIA type.\r\nSome people on the list cheered me on while I pressed for public\r\nanswers. It turned out that the post _was_ from a former Company man,\r\nand as I persisted in querying Robert David Steele about his funding and\r\nmotives, he sent me a colorfully worded note that might have made a\r\nParis Island drill instructor envious. I quoted his e-mail, as I would\r\nhave done if writing this up for a magazine. What a way to justify my\r\nfears of the intelligence establishment playing too powerful a role in\r\ndetermining the content of material online. I remembered the valuable\r\nexposés that the press had done of the CIA years ago; we need to\r\nseparate U.S. journalists from spies, lest impartiality of the news\r\nmedia suffer. This debate I would win.\r\n\r\nBut I didn’t. In fact, I suffered a major debacle; flame after flame\r\nfrom bystanders assailed _me_. Even though I told Robert Steele I wanted\r\npublic answers, people felt that I had violated the traditional\r\nprohibition against quoting private posts in public, at least with names\r\nattached. Some of the bluntest Anglo-Saxonisms came from luminaries on\r\nthe Internet. People wanted perfect freedom to speak their minds in\r\nmessages deemed private, just as professors and students in class would\r\nwant to be free to say outrageous things without ending up on the front\r\npages of the local paper. I, on the other hand, had applied journalistic\r\nexpectations to the Net. A reporter might end up with a better story if\r\na celebrity exploded during an interview and this fact came out in\r\nprint. But on the Internet, the freedom to be outrageous in private\r\nmattered more than the freedom to quote, even with advanced warning.\r\nYes, I had questions about this custom. What if people took advantage of\r\nthis Netiquette to engage in sexual or racial abuse, or just abuse,\r\nperiod? Should rules really be hard and fast? Just the same, in Net\r\nterms, I was the loser here because I wore my Writer Hat at the wrong\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nLuckily the story ended happily. Robert Steele and I, while disagreeing,\r\nmade our peace. I went to one of his conferences and shook his hand.\r\nLater I happily discovered that he shared my hatred of the Clipper chip,\r\nthe loathsome White House scheme to make it easier to snoop on citizens’\r\ncommunications. He was far more openminded than I’d originally expected.\r\nEven without that consideration, however, a feud just didn’t make sense\r\nhere. Canter and Siegel may claim you can reach 30 million people in one\r\nswoop, but as I say repeatedly, the Net is a _series_ of communities,\r\nsome of them rather small-townish. Within our somewhat overlapping\r\ncircles, it would have been mutually harmful for Robert Steele and me to\r\nsquander time and reputations on a protracted flame war.\r\n\r\nOther kinds of clashes take place between Internet culture and that of\r\ntraditional media types; in the eyes of many people on the Net, print\r\npeople are not the only villains. _Dateline NBC_ ran a story about\r\nchildren using computer connections to locate recipes for making bombs.\r\nThe children, however, could have done the same at bookstores or public\r\nlibraries. _Dateline_’s episode reminded one Netizen of the time NBC\r\nsecretly used a hidden ignition system to show that an automobile could\r\nexplode. Just as bizarrely, in print and on the air, some journalists\r\nlove stories about the Internet as a playground for child molesters. If\r\nwe on the Net were a religious or ethnic group, we could start an\r\nantidefamation league and keep it forever busy.\r\n\r\nBy Net standards, the media bumble in yet other ways. If you’re a\r\nnewspaper or magazine journalist, you may have been reared to neuter\r\nyourself about The News; no opinions online, please. On the Net,\r\nhowever, many people are suspicious if you do _not_ join the crowd and\r\nspeak out. They dislike net-thropologists; that is, media people and\r\nothers who study the Net rather than contribute to it. Among some\r\njournalists the standard modus operandi is to post questions for an\r\narticle, then vanish without sharing anything with the Netfolks.\r\n\r\nHappily, this is changing somewhat. In fact, you can find a few\r\njournalists from the _New York Times_, _Wall Street Journal_,\r\n_Washington Post_, and other major papers speaking up online about\r\nmatters dear to them. Recently a reader flamed the _Post_ for its\r\nInternet coverage (“what those idiots at the _Post_ write isn’t worth\r\nminimum wage”). Alluding to software that can screen out messages from\r\noffensive people, reporter John Schwartz punched right back: “It’s bozo\r\nfilter time.” He had been using online services for years, and here, it\r\nshowed. The old stereotype, in which all members of the major media are\r\nclueless, just doesn’t fly any more. Not too long ago somebody shared a\r\n_New York Times_ article—discussing some other people’s proposal for a\r\nnational digital library—with hundreds of a members of a list devoted to\r\nlaw in cyberspace. He did not ask permission from the _Times_. A pithy\r\nreference to copyright law then emanated from none other than Peter\r\nLewis, who had written the article and was a regular on the list.\r\n\r\nSo how are Netfolks treating Lewis nowadays? He e-mailed back an answer\r\nin prose worthy of a discussion group on the Internet itself:\r\n\r\n    _It took me a while to get used to being flamed by pencil-dicked\r\n    geeks who hide behind their terminals, saying things I’m sure\r\n    they’d never dream of saying to my face. But now I’ve become\r\n    something of a connoisseur of flamage, and while I regret that\r\n    it is widespread on the Net, I regret more that the quality of\r\n    flaming is almost uniformly weak. I now savor good flames and\r\n    ignore the rest. On the other hand, it took me almost as long to\r\n    get used to having instant feedback, often pointed and critical\r\n    and right-on, to my writing. While there is a danger of a\r\n    “chilling effect” from flamage, perhaps subtly influencing\r\n    reporters to back off a subject in anticipation of a flood of\r\n    “Dear Clueless” letters, I think the overall benefit of instant\r\n    and widespread reader feedback is a Good Thing. Perhaps all\r\n    rookie reporters should be required to write a Net story just to\r\n    let them know that they do not write in a vacuum, whether their\r\n    beat is the Internet or the police station or sports._\r\n\r\nLike the police beat, the Internet comes with its set of rules—as my\r\nexperience with the CIA alum vividly showed. Some on the Net attach a\r\nstatement to every post saying it’s copyrighted. Others just worry that\r\nthe wrong set of people may read and quote their more outspoken\r\nmessages. Lewis considers list and newsgroup posts to be public: “My\r\nmother once advised me, long before she knew I would be a journalist,\r\n‘Never put anything on paper that you wouldn’t want to see on the front\r\npage of the _New York Times_.’”\r\n\r\nStill, Lewis normally catches up with the writers of posts he plans to\r\nquote. “However, the reason has more to do with verification than with\r\nnetiquette. In cyberland as well as in the real world, as you know, the\r\nfact that someone’s name and address appear in a letter does not\r\nguarantee the identity of the writer.” Lewis reminded me that “half a\r\ncentury ago some newspapers forbade reporters from quoting sources\r\ncontacted by telephone on the same rationale: How do you really know\r\nthat was Mr. Doe on the phone if you didn’t see him? In cyberville, not\r\nonly can we not see our sources, but neither can we hear them.” And then\r\na few sentences later came the electronic signature, “Pete (at least,\r\nyou _think_ it’s Pete) Lewis.”[4.8]\r\n\r\nOther challenges exist online. When reporters use e-mail for interviews,\r\nthey take away the element of surprise—often the surest route to the\r\nbest answer. “Also,” says Jordan Green, a Canadian freelancer who relies\r\nheavily on e-mail, “there is no body language or voice intonation in\r\ne-mail. We do have our various symbols to >>>highlight<<< and\r\n_emphasize_ WORDS and feelings :-) but there is far more which cannot be\r\npicked up.”\r\n\r\nIn the end, however, computer networks will make the press better\r\ninformed, not worse. Via Lycos, for example, a searching tool on the\r\nWeb, I can track down files written by just the right person to\r\ninterview or find background information that someone archived from the\r\nrelevant newsgroup. Besides, who says that all interviews are\r\nconfrontational? Often e-mail is just right, and I can always use the\r\ntelephone to fill in gaps. “I used to ask, ‘What’s your fax number?’ at\r\nthe end of a phone interview,” says a magazine writer named Peggy\r\nNoonan.[4.9] “Now I also ask, ‘What’s your e-mail address’ because it’s\r\noften much faster to post a question or send a draft for approval via\r\ne-mail than by another means.” Some journalists might object to showing\r\ndrafts to sources. But Noonan clearly sees the networks as a godsend for\r\nother purposes as well.\r\n\r\nAnother believer is Arik Hesseldahl, a young reporter with the _Idaho\r\nState Journal_ in Pocatello who, like many journalists of his\r\ngeneration, grew accustomed to the technology in college. “Remember that\r\nflesh-eating bug scare a few months ago?” he said. “I got in touch with\r\na doctor in England who debunked all the rumors and media hype, which is\r\nwhat it was—hype. Just today I am looking for an expert on nuclear fuel\r\nreprocessing equipment who is untainted by the Department of Energy and\r\nthe rest of the federal nuke bureaucracy. Already I’ve gotten five\r\nsuggestions for experts.”\r\n\r\nI myself see other advantages for people in the pulped-wood world; via\r\nthe Net I don’t just approach editors—I hear from them out of the blue\r\nwhen they like my postings. Other freelancers have also benefited.\r\nSteven Sander Ross, a professor at Columbia University, uses the Net to\r\ncommunicate with European magazines that pay better than those in the\r\nStates. Just as the Net creates global markets for florists and sellers\r\nof teddy bears, it multiplies opportunities for the best writers. That\r\nis true for newspaper and magazine writers now and will be increasingly\r\ntrue for authors of books. Mind you, there is a downside, too. The Net\r\nmay actually _hurt_ the worst writers as they face more competition,\r\nwhether from professionals across the planet or from the free material\r\nthat Netfolks share with each other.\r\n\r\nHere are three case histories that should be of interest to writers,\r\neditors, publishers, and the rest of the cosmos:\r\n\r\n• Case History 1. The _News & Observer_ has used the Internet not only\r\n  to reach the denizens but also to get existing readers and advertisers\r\n  on the Net. In an era when so many greedsters hope to charge\r\n  outrageous fees to consumers for online information, the _N & O_ is\r\n  hoping that ads will pay much or even most of the freight.\r\n\r\n• Case History 2. Time Warner, as noted, is putting magazines and book\r\n  excerpts on the Internet, and it’s doing so in ways befitting the\r\n  medium. Many of the same concepts carry over from online newspapers,\r\n  which is why this section and the next will be much shorter than Case\r\n  History 1. In fact, so far, an _N & O_-style business model seems to\r\n  be influencing Time at least somewhat.\r\n\r\n• Case History 3. Laura Fillmore runs an online bookstore that not only\r\n  sells books but _gives them away_ on the Internet. She even used the\r\n  Net to promote a pulped-wood book that has sold hundreds of thousands\r\n  of copies. Fillmore’s ideas are significant because she is working\r\n  hard to reconcile publishers’ needs with those of society at large,\r\n  and I commend one of her business models as an alternative to\r\n  pay-per-read gouges. The ultimate answer, in my own opinion, is a\r\n  national digital library and a program to drive down the cost of\r\n  book-friendly hardware. Using this approach—a mix of editorial and\r\n  technical wizardry to add to the value of plain text—good publishers\r\n  would flourish. Readers and writers would come out ahead, too.\r\n\r\nFinally, I’ll offer an update on the _N & O_ and other publications on\r\nthe Internet. When Frank Daniels described the Net as “unorganized” and\r\n“unruly,” he might also have been talking about certain trends in his\r\nown industry. A surprising twist unfolded in the story of the _N & O_.\r\n\r\nNewspapers on the Net:\r\nThe Raleigh Experiment\r\n\r\nMore than two decades ago in a scuffy-floored room at the University of\r\nNorth Carolina, not that far from the _N & O_, I heard Professor Walter\r\nSpearman expound on the prickly question of uppity letters to the\r\neditor. What if a reader taunted, “You’ll never print this?” The crux of\r\nWalt Spearman’s wisdom was this: _Don’t go for the bait. If you don’t\r\nwant to print it, don’t._[4.10] He was teaching me to be, in modern\r\nparlance, a “gatekeeper”—to decide which news and opinions made it into\r\nprint and which didn’t. Only so many column inches existed on the\r\neditorial page, and we journalists were to watch over this space as if\r\nit were the Mona Lisa. Without the slightest apology, we should tell the\r\npublic what to read, and besides lording over the editorial pages, we\r\nshould inflict the same front page stories on everyone. The notion that\r\neach reader could write regularly for other readers, or that he or she\r\ncould see wire service stories online, was as sacrilegious as it was\r\nscience fiction-like.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the 1970s, however, at Duke, UNC, and N.C. State, hackers\r\nwere paving the way for Usenet, a series of discussion areas on the\r\nInternet and on bulletin board systems that let _everyone_ have a\r\nsay—from Nazis to Maoists. Together with talk radio and with other forms\r\nof computer communications, Usenet could help Americans bypass the\r\ngatekeepers. Readers wouldn’t see on their screens an appealing\r\ncombination of headlines and Times Roman type. But no blue pencils would\r\nbe around to scratch out the heresies of nonjournalists.\r\n\r\nUsenet in the end wouldn’t just carry alt.activism or comp.general or\r\nalt.sex; it would also be home to a nice little electronic newspaper\r\ncalled ClariNet, which in 1995 enjoyed 100,000-plus readers, and which\r\neach day let readers choose from among hundreds of dispatches from\r\nReuters, the Associated Press, and more specialized services. My friend\r\nJim Besser covered Washington for a string of Jewish newspapers. He\r\ncould dial up ClariNet, other sections of Usenet, and the Internet at\r\nlarge and see material that might take days and days to wend its way\r\ninto the _Washington Post_, assuming it ever got there at all. Usenet in\r\nthe end was more of a wire service than a newspaper; that just may have\r\nbeen its real triumph. Some old print people hated ClariNet, seeing it\r\nas a threat to their gatekeeping. For a while, ClariNet sent out the\r\ncolumns of Dave Barry, the quirky but popular humorist enjoyed by\r\nthousands of Netheads. Then, however, his syndicate pulled him off the\r\nservice. Illegal copies had wafted all over the Internet, and the\r\nbootlegging had surely outraged client newspapers—the main reason; but a\r\nsecond, minor one may have existed as well—the hostility between the Net\r\nand many members of the print media.\r\n\r\nThe Internet was partly why Michael Crichton, the author of the novel\r\n_Jurassic Park_, could shrug off newspapers and some other mass media as\r\n“tomorrow’s fossil fuel.” The Cable News Network and radio talk shows\r\nare not the only threats to the hegemony of the old-time gatekeepers. So\r\nare the Internet, CompuServe, America Online, GEnie, Delphi, and, of\r\ncourse, the more than 50,000 bulletin board systems run by hobbyists and\r\nothers. “Newspapers,” wrote the media critic Jon Katz, “have been\r\nfoundering for decades, their readers aging, their revenues declining,\r\ntheir circulations sinking, their sense of mission fragmented in a world\r\nwhere the fate of presidents is slugged out on MTV, _Donahue_, and\r\n_Larry King Live_.”\r\n\r\nI was fascinated, then, to learn that the old _News & Observer_ was on\r\nthe Net now. Was the _N & O_ serving readers better? With the above in\r\nmind I spent several weeks talking to the Raleigh people on the phone\r\nand via e-mail, and studying the electronic versions of the newspaper,\r\nboth the free samples on the Net and the version for paying customers.\r\n\r\nMy conclusions were positive, though not entirely. Katz, the author of\r\nthe “Still Suck” article in _Wired_, would have disliked some aspects of\r\nthe _N & O_’s electronic efforts. _Wired_ had asked, “How can an\r\nindustry which regularly pulls Doonesbury strips for being too\r\ncontroversial possibly hope to survive online?” And, sure enough, if you\r\nwere on the Internet by way of the _N & O_’s service in fall 1994, you\r\ncouldn’t subscribe to the alt.sex string of newsgroups. Moreover, unlike\r\nthe _Time_ areas online, the _N & O_’s BBS had not sprouted hundreds of\r\nmessages from free-spirited readers and editors. Truly controversial\r\npostings were rare. And yet the editors were clearly moving away from\r\nthe traditional gatekeeping role. Meanwhile, the _N & O_ was enriching\r\nthe Internet by way of well-written news stories and features—many\r\navailable for free. Flaws aside, this was a fine example of how the\r\nprint media could befriend the Net and the young people who favored\r\ncomputer screens over pulped wood.\r\n\r\nFrank Daniels III, the executive editor, tinkered with computers himself\r\nin high school two decades ago, and as early as the late 1980s he was\r\nusing Macs to shuffle around stories on the pages of a magazine that his\r\nfamily owned in Charlotte, North Carolina. Working with a stock analyst,\r\nDaniels created a computerized database of the top fifty companies in\r\nthe Charlotte area, and that, in turn, led to a newsletter. So early on,\r\nDaniels saw how high tech could spawn lucrative opportunities. He also\r\nsaw the negatives. The owners of the _Los Angeles Times_, Knight-Ridder,\r\nand other organizations were experimenting with Videotext, which allowed\r\nnews stories to scroll across television screens.\r\n\r\nSuch endeavors were brave. They were also premature. Videotext at the\r\ntime cost the customers too much, and just as the Prodigy service would\r\nerr later on in the same way, the newspapers failed to appreciate the\r\nfondness of many customers for typing to each other. Reading news\r\nstories and shopping from home weren’t enough.\r\n\r\nMany U.S. dailies would go on to flounder even on pulped wood. Whether\r\nAmericans were watching video-cassettes or hang gliding, millions had\r\nother uses for their time, especially baby boomers. Some 60 percent of\r\nthe households in Wake County had once subscribed to the _N & O_; by the\r\nlate 1980s, just 40 percent did. Newspapers kissed off much of the\r\nmarket, jacked up their prices, and began seeing themselves as a way for\r\nadvertisers to reach at least the Oldsmobile set if not the BMW set. And\r\nyet, even by those criteria, the _N & O_ was a slacker. Back then, as it\r\ndoes today, the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area boasted one of the\r\nhighest concentrations of Ph.D.s in the country. Some 40 percent of the\r\nhouseholds now own computers, more than 10 percent can go online, and\r\nthe average home price is well on the way to equaling that of some major\r\nmetropolitan areas. Even five years ago, and long before, high tech was\r\nenriching the Research Triangle.\r\n\r\nBut would the _N & O_ adapt to this new market, a harbinger for many\r\nother areas in the United States and elsewhere? Frank Daniels saw the\r\nnewspaper as a change-proof antique, and he was ready to dump his _N &\r\nO_ stock and sink the money into an online service.\r\n\r\nThen Daniels got some journalistic religion at a newspaper seminar, the\r\nsecular equivalent of a good Baptist soaking. To hear him tell it, he\r\nsuddenly understood that “the relationship between a newspaper and a\r\ncommunity has such a richness and history that communities shouldn’t\r\nlose that.” And he felt that online services could take advantage of\r\nthose relationships with readers and advertisers. Today the _N & O_ goes\r\nby this philosophy, not entirely but to a great extent. Readers can\r\ne-mail many of their favorite writers, while long-time advertisers can\r\nbuy _X_ number of column inches in the paper editions and receive\r\nexposure in the electronic editions.\r\n\r\nSomething else, however, may have bound Frank Daniels to his paper as\r\nwell—old family stories and the memories they stirred. The first Daniels\r\nlanded in North Carolina several hundred years ago, and the family\r\nreunions continue to this day. Frank III’s great-grandfather, Josephus\r\nDaniels, purchased the _N & O_ at a bankruptcy auction in 1894. He\r\ncarried on as one of the state’s more colorful and outspoken publishers,\r\nwith a strong populist streak, and took time off in Washington to serve\r\nas secretary of the Navy under Woodrow Wilson. I ran across Josephus on\r\nthe Internet, just as serendipitously as I had found A. C. Snow. Through\r\nthe American Memory Project at the Library of Congress, I could _hear_\r\nJosephus honor two naval heroes with a speech called “There Is No Rank\r\nin Sacrifice.” I passed on word of my discovery to Bruce Siceloff, an\r\nonline editor, and he played another Daniels’ speech for the clan while\r\nshowing off the paper’s marvels of technology. Frank Jr., publisher of\r\nthe _N & O_, tapped the arm of a cousin who had just walked into the\r\nroom. “That’s your grandfather,” he said as the spooky old wax recording\r\ncrackled away in its new electronic incarnation.[4.11]\r\n\r\nJosephus, though his racial views softened, reflected the separatism of\r\nmany Carolinians in the first half of the twentieth century. The paper\r\nitself changed. It eventually hired Claude Sitton, a Pulitzer winner\r\nnotable for his civil rights reporting in his days with the _New York\r\nTimes_. The _N & O_ in some ways became the _Times South_. Reporters\r\nfought racial injustices. Frank III portrayed the paper of that era as\r\nnever having met a cause it didn’t like. What’s more, he said the _N &\r\nO_, although exposing politicians on the take, was too quick to\r\neditorialize for local programs that raised local tax rates. I myself\r\nfavored the crusading kind of newspaper—in fact, one risk of a high-tech\r\norientation was that it could turn a newspaper into an uncritical\r\ncheerleader for business if editors were not careful—but I could\r\nunderstand Daniels’ concern over government spending. At any rate some\r\nfelt that the _N & O_ was losing touch with many readers, and so Frank\r\nJr. and the others on the board of directors agreed to let Frank III\r\nserve as executive editor in the wake of Sitton’s retirement.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the old and new editors couldn’t have been more\r\nstark. Sitton was a formal man who insisted that his reporters wear\r\nsuits and ties. Frank III relaxed the dress code. In place of a sign\r\nwith his editorial title, he stuck up one that said simply, “Frat Man.”\r\nOld-timers groaned that this young Duke alum lacked enough journalistic\r\nexperience. The man had been the newspaper’s _operations manager_.\r\nWasn’t it apparent? For each year of experience on the State side of\r\nnewspapering, you could subtract two years of experience with the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nEven under Sitton, the reporters typed away on a modern publishing\r\nsystem for newspapers. But that was more or less all they did—write.\r\nMany could just as well have been pounding away on old Smith Coronas.\r\nThey hadn’t any desire to learn the technology, not when there were\r\ndoors to knock on, vote counts to check, political corruption to\r\nchronicle, Ku Klux Klan rallies to report, and courthouse records to\r\nsearch the old-fashioned way. Young Daniels set to work changing all\r\nthat, and with the most surpassing of allies. The news librarians almost\r\ninstantly grasped the potential of computerized databases. So did Pat\r\nStith, the senior investigative reporter. The _N & O_ would go on to\r\ncollect state records showing traffic or hunting violations, or others,\r\nand then seek out patterns. “We analyzed all the speeding tickets,” said\r\nDaniels, “and found out what percentage of tickets were given at each\r\nmile-per-hour level. It turns out that if you go 63 miles per hour in a\r\n55-mile-per-hour zone, you have less than a 1 percent chance of getting\r\na ticket.” Via the same quantitative techniques, the _N & O_ could\r\nevaluate the programs of local government. By the time Daniels had\r\neffected his transformation, he had squeezed dozens of personal\r\ncomputers into an already-crowded newsroom.\r\n\r\nA year or so after Frank Daniels III became executive editor, he first\r\nbeheld the Internet over at North Carolina State. “An engineering\r\nstudent said, ‘Have you seen this?’ and he showed me Usenet. And about\r\nforty-five minutes later, while I was thirty minutes late for a meeting,\r\nI was speechless. I walked out. I was just buzzing with the\r\npossibilities.” Daniels saw some engineering newsgroups and, yes, some\r\nsexually related ones. “I couldn’t believe how many people I saw talking\r\ntogether, just following each other’s conversations. The letters to the\r\neditor at the time were the only connection the _News & Observer_ had\r\nwith its readers.\r\n\r\n“Our business is connecting people. Here was a whole world that existed\r\nwithout our knowledge. It was a small world and an elitist world, but it\r\nconfirmed my earlier belief that computers were going to be ubiquitous.”\r\n\r\nEffortlessly Daniels understood that Usenet wasn’t Videotext—people\r\n_wanted_ you to talk back. So the Internet was at least on his mind as a\r\npossibility for the time when the numbers were right. Daniels for the\r\nmoment pushed into less exotic areas; for example, he started a useful,\r\nlively, but expensive fax newsletter for the elite, _The Insider_, which\r\ncovered North Carolina politics with a commitment to detail missing from\r\nthe daily press. The _N & O_ also offered sophisticated research\r\nservices, using the databases it was amassing. And the paper let readers\r\ndial up stories over the telephone through a technology known as\r\nAudiotext.\r\n\r\nThe electronic action, however, really took off after Daniels hired\r\nGeorge Schlukbier, a computer-oriented librarian who had worked wonders\r\nat the _Sacramento Bee_. Like Daniels the frat boy, Schlukbier flaunted\r\na few eccentricities within bounds. An electronic signature at the\r\nbottom of his Internet messages identified him as “Chief Bull Goose\r\nLooney,” a tribute to the giant Indian who terrorized Nurse Ratched in\r\n_One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest_, the Ken Kesey novel. Some, of course,\r\nmight argue that the Internet is itself a virtual asylum with the\r\ninmates in charge.\r\n\r\nSchlukbier and Daniels checked out Prodigy and America Online to see\r\nabout getting on those networks and decided that the numbers stank. Yes,\r\nProdigy-style services already had their networks in place, and the _Los\r\nAngeles Times_ and papers in George, New York and elsewhere would go on\r\nto sign up. But the _N & O_ concluded—rightly, in my opinion—that the\r\nonline services would need the newspapers more than the newspapers would\r\nneed the online services. Newspapers were the best source of steady,\r\ndetailed news about local communities. Each year the _N & O_ spent $12\r\nmillion covering mainly local and state news, an amount that even a\r\ngiant like Prodigy could not replicate everywhere. “They’ve got their\r\nview of the world that’s defined by whatever technology they adopted at\r\nthe time they started their service,” Daniels would later say. “We got\r\nuncomfortable with the fact we’d be living their rules, and the\r\ncustomers would be their customers.”[4.12]\r\n\r\nSome other newspapers felt happy with Prodigy. “No,” said Mike Gordon,\r\nan editor with Cox Newspapers in Atlanta, “Prodigy isn’t taking most of\r\nthe money.” What’s more, his online edition could enjoy revenue from\r\nonline ads. Still, more and more publishers were turning to the Internet\r\nrather than Prodigy-type alternatives, and the balance of power changed.\r\nWhen Microsoft started a new online service later, it offered newspapers\r\nas much as 80 percent of revenue—at least several times the amount that\r\nProdigy had offered the _N & O_. (The Atlanta papers would themselves\r\nend up on the Internet eventually, not just on Prodigy.)\r\n\r\nInstead of relying on a Prodigy-style service, Schlukbier started a\r\nlocally oriented BBS with an Internet connection and a strong emphasis\r\non schoolchildren, not just the adult readers of today. This orientation\r\nmay have baffled many. Some newspaper publishers were too myopic to see\r\npast the next quarter, especially if they worked for the big chains.\r\nExceptions did exist, of course. Knight-Ridder, for example, regardless\r\nof its public ownership and its Videotext flop, was still pouring\r\nmillions into the new technology. As a family-owned newspaper, however,\r\nwithout security analysts breathing down its corporate neck, the _N & O_\r\nwas especially free to experiment. Schlukbier believed that a decade\r\nwould pass before 40 or 50 percent of the homes in Raleigh were online,\r\nand by then the children would be of customer age.\r\n\r\n“By focusing on third-graders,” Schlukbier said, “I’ve got ten years to\r\nlearn from them what information they really need and want.”[4.13] What\r\nthey hoped for, in many ways, didn’t seem like a newspaper at all.\r\nRather they wanted their own tools. The bulletin board blossomed with\r\nimaginary worlds in which, for example, Frank Daniels was the owner of a\r\nfictitious newsstand. Children could wend their ways through cyberspace\r\nby using written descriptions and computer commands to tell where they\r\nwere and what they were doing. George Schlukbier’s young son, Shane,\r\ndesigned a mythical camp online with danger-ridden woods. Some may have\r\nwondered how this applied to _newspapers_; I myself did. And then it\r\ndawned: if newspapers would be increasingly two-way in the future, just\r\nlike the Net, then didn’t it make sense to see how the children\r\ninteracted with each other, as they did in role-playing games? The\r\nchildren could change as they grew older, or moved away from the area\r\nwhen their parents packed up for another job with IBM, but the\r\njournalists could still observe the basic patterns.\r\n\r\nThe _N & O_ put more than 6,000 children and 700 teachers online for\r\nfree. NandOLand was the name of the educational service designed with\r\nchildren in mind; a mouse click on a cloud, for example, would take\r\nchildren to a NASA area on the Net. The students could send electronic\r\nmail to each other or type to each other instantly. “I have seen\r\nchildren who never cared what they wrote turn to a dictionary rather\r\nthan send a letter to a key pal with misspelled words,” said a teacher\r\nnamed Stephanie Toney. “I have seen a child with a severe reading\r\ndisability sit for hours and concentrate on e-mail to another person on\r\nthe other side of the world. His English teacher would have given her\r\nright arm to interest him in reading and writing for this period of\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\nGranted, NandOLand wasn’t the entire solution to the needs of children.\r\nMany couldn’t spend much time on a machine at school and lacked one at\r\nhome. But the program was much better than the alternative: expensive\r\nschool connections to the Net or no Internet at all.\r\n\r\nLike the children, the _N & O_ itself was learning—about the local\r\nschools and other institutions and the Net itself. “How many newspaper\r\neditors and reporters get to talk with students, parents, and teachers\r\nany time they want to without making a big deal of it?” asked\r\nDaniels.[4.14] And so the educational coverage was better. Rosalind\r\nResnick, publisher of _Interactive Publishing Alert_, wrote that the _N\r\n& O_ was “at the head of the pack when it comes to promoting\r\ninteractivity between its readers and reporters.” By the summer of 1995\r\nevery staff member, including those in circulation and advertising,\r\nwould be able to go on the Net from their desks. Daniels’ own Net\r\naddress showed up on the paper’s editorial page each day. The _N & O_\r\nwas publishing a dozen or two Internet items each month, complete with a\r\ncolumn called “Net Rider.” How different the paper was from a rival in\r\nnearby Durham: “We don’t print many Internet stories,” a staffer there\r\nsaid when I asked to speak to whoever covered the Net. The words were\r\nspoken almost in a way to suggest that “Internet” was synonymous with\r\n“_N & O_.”\r\n\r\nNot everyone was happy with the _N & O_’s Internet service. Around 700\r\npeople had subscribed commercially by fall 1994, paying $20 a month, and\r\nsome rightly complained about the look and feel of the BBS and the busy\r\nphone lines they had encountered during the summer. When I posted a\r\nquery on the Internet, at least half of the replies were hostile to the\r\nonline _N & O_. Some showed a knee-jerk hatred because they disagreed\r\nwith the paper’s politics. But others were right on target. The BBS\r\nincarnation of NandO.Net, the name for the commercial part of the online\r\nendeavors, was more of a rutted dirt road than an eight-lane information\r\nhighway. Customers for some months had trouble dialing up the service’s\r\nmodems for want of enough phone lines. Other glitches arose. The service\r\nprided itself on the ability to whip people back and forth between the\r\nlocal board and the Internet-related services without any effort. And\r\nyet in making the transitions, customers suffered delays and software\r\nglitches that they might not encounter with a more polished service.\r\nSchoolchildren and BBS junkies were the best kinds of people to enjoy\r\nthe wild ride and the scenery.\r\n\r\nThe online _N & O_ responded with some technical improvements; the paper\r\nadded many more phone lines and gave customers the ability to use Mosaic\r\nto point and click their way through the Web. Mosaic had a much smoother\r\nfeel than the BBS software. By late 1994 the _N & O_ was offering the\r\npublic an electronic newspaper and the Internet at the competitive rate\r\nof $20 a month while helping to subsidize the educational side. And it\r\nwas serving people with different levels of equipment. The BBS was\r\ndesigned to work especially well with less powerful machines and\r\nsnailish modems that were far too slow for Mosaic.\r\n\r\nOn the Net, the people who answered my queries had another major\r\ncomplaint—the inability of NandO.Net to make alt.sex-style groups\r\nconveniently available. Frank Daniels made no apologies. However liberal\r\ntowns like Chapel Hill might be, the state as a whole was of the\r\nopposite bent. And that included more than a few church-goers in\r\nRaleigh. “The community standards of our community don’t mix with some\r\nof the sexual parts of Usenet,” Daniels said, “so we edit them out.” In\r\naddition, most subscribers were children. “I have a seven year old,” he\r\nsaid, “and I don’t want him delving into alt.sex.bestiality or those\r\nother places.” Many of the Netheads would have said that one person’s\r\n“editing” was another’s “censorship.” I myself, however, understood\r\nDaniel’s worries. At least two other Net services were available in the\r\nsame area, so it wasn’t as if he were gatekeeping for the entire town;\r\nwhat’s more, he said that when the software allowed, the sex-related\r\nnewsgroups would be available as an option. Just the same, the issue\r\nepitomized the clash between the gatekeeping ethos and that of the\r\nInternet.\r\n\r\nMore serious than the lack of alt.sex, to my mind, was Daniels’ failure\r\nto appreciate sufficiently the political freedom of Usenet, the same\r\nservice that had attracted him to the Internet in the first place. I\r\ncomplained to him that his own BBS included far, far less in the way of\r\npolitical discussion than I’d have wanted, and I contrasted this to the\r\nrobust debates of Usenet. “To be honest, David,” he said, “I think one\r\nof the least useful pieces of the Internet so far is their political\r\ndiscussions. They’re not very good ones. There’s a lot of flaming. The\r\npolitical discussions aren’t very productive. I follow mainly the local\r\nones here. These people discuss national issues and never have a\r\npolicymaker looking in there. So why discuss it if it isn’t going to\r\nhave an impact on policy?”\r\n\r\nWhile Daniels was worlds ahead of newspaper editors at large, he was\r\nshowing the vestiges of the gatekeeping mindset that the new technology\r\nhad made obsolete. I myself disliked unmitigated flaming. And yet there\r\nwere times when harsh words were called for. The _N & O_ didn’t wimp out\r\nwhen the editorial board attacked the Ku Klux Klan or the more\r\noutrageous statements of Jesse Helms, the right-wing senator. Why should\r\npeople online be any different? And although it might be nice for a\r\npolicymaker to read my public messages as soon as I sent them out—and,\r\nyes, I could recall hearing out of the blue from the White House after\r\none such posting—that was hardly necessary. Democracy isn’t just a\r\ncitizen writing to a congressman. It is also citizens communicating with\r\ncitizens, educating, proselytizing; and with the economies of Usenet,\r\nmore citizens could reach their peers for greater enlightenment. And\r\nthen, if a consensus were reached, political action might ensue, such as\r\nletters to Congress. So why must politicians be involved from Day One?\r\nDaniels was out of touch here, and I hoped he’d catch on.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly NandO.Netters could hook up with the Usenet political areas,\r\neven if the _N & O_ played them down; but the newspaper didn’t really\r\npromote political debates on the BBS itself. And it was not just because\r\nDaniels believed that the readers disliked flaming and extremism—it was\r\nalso because he felt that real, live politicians were not ready for\r\nonline appearances yet. “When we can get commitment from the politicians\r\nand policymakers, then we’ll make a push at it. But not until it becomes\r\nsomething where our community can have really productive discussions. I\r\ndon’t want to train them not to like them. What happens is that the\r\npeople on the Net are trained not to like them. Extremists and flamers\r\nlove them.” I supposed there were a lot of us undesirables, however; for\r\nalt.activism and similar areas were among the more popular newsgroups on\r\nthe Net—no match for alt.sex, but certainly not small time.\r\n\r\nIf Daniels had had a complete set of Net values, he would have\r\nunderstood the benefits of debate online, and not just the political\r\naction but the _education_. I myself was liberal. And yet when\r\ndiscussing information policy, I could learn at times from the most\r\nzealous of Libertarians and Objectivists. Some were among the most\r\nadvanced of the technologists. In fact, their technical backgrounds may\r\nhave led to their hatred of regulation—they loathed the bureaucrats who\r\ncould not fathom the direction in which computers and communications\r\nwere headed.\r\n\r\nTo his credit, Daniels at least was not calling for censorship of\r\nUsenet; he was merely saying that he wanted his own service to be\r\ndifferent. What’s more, technology and marketing forces, the great\r\ndeciders of cyberspace, might change his mind for him.\r\n\r\nJust as he had assumed in the first place, people on the Net wanted to\r\n_talk_—not just to the _N & O_ but to each other about all kinds of\r\ntopics, including material in the paper itself. And the more comfortable\r\nthe readers grew with the online world, the more spirited, the more\r\nUsenet-like, would be the discussions. No, the meek would not suddenly\r\nturn into flamers. But the thrill of technology would be less of a\r\ndistraction, and they would pay more heed to what they had to say and\r\ngrow more adventurous about it. On the _N & O_’s present BBS, with its\r\noften awkward commands, many people were not even leaving messages for\r\neach other. Instead they typically used the system at a more primitive\r\nlevel to type out their thoughts with the other person online at the\r\nsame time. I hated this approach. It brought to mind Dave Barry’s crack\r\nthat the Internet was like CB radio with typing.\r\n\r\nEven if Daniels still did not enjoy the political debates on the Net\r\nitself, he was living up to the old tradition of sharing material with\r\nthe rest of the world. In that sense his newspaper was exemplary. The _N\r\n& O_ didn’t just offer news, discussion areas, and games for its\r\nsubscribers: Sample news and features were free to anyone who wanted to\r\nread them. That was how I’d first run across A.C. Snow. I’d seen the _N\r\n& O_’s name on a list of newspapers, and A.C. had caught my eye as I was\r\nwandering through the Gopher that stored sample news stories and columns\r\nfrom the paper. The World Wide Web, however, was the best way to try out\r\nthe electronic _N & O_. When I dialed up the main page for NandO.Net, I\r\ncould see a colorful, bluish logo and enjoy a newsstandish atmosphere,\r\nwith scads of goodies to explore. The _N & O_ differed from many\r\nelectronic newspapers. It didn’t just inflict on readers a digest of\r\ngeneric news, with only the most cursory helping of original material.\r\n\r\nI read samples from the regular _N & O_ and specialized publications\r\nsuch as the _Insider_; enjoyed brief but regularly updated electronic\r\nnews intended for the Net itself; wandered through a little bookstore\r\nwith cover shots from books by Snow and other columnists; wended my way\r\nthrough tens of thousands of words from a journalism seminar at Harvard;\r\nsoaked up long, multimedia features; dialed up samples of rock music;\r\nand ventured into the sports area—the _N & O_’s most popular material on\r\nthe Web.\r\n\r\nThe sports area was the baby of a bearded, forty-something editor named\r\nEric Harris who had turned into a Nethead, and who like Schlukbier came\r\nwith a nickname: “Zonker.” A child, seeing the beard and taking in the\r\npersonality, had compared him to the Doonesbury character. That was a\r\nlittle unfair. Zonker of the comics is a goof-off, while Zonker of the\r\nNet is a workaholic whose messages might bear 4 A.M. time stamps. Harris\r\nis Webmaster—the man with the daily responsibility for the content of\r\nthe Web area in general—but his true love was sports. He packed the\r\nserver with game schedules. During the ’94 baseball strike the _N & O_\r\nindulged fans with whimsy such as “Cybersox Take the World\r\nSeries”—reportage of mythical games. “Need something to do while we wait\r\nfor the owners and players to resolve their differences?” the Web area\r\nasked on another electronic page. “Well, the Baseball Server is doing\r\nits part. Download the above images, tack them onto the wall, and buy a\r\nset of darts. Then, every time you feel a twinge of baseball withdrawal,\r\ngrab a dart, think a ‘warm’ thought about one of the participants, and\r\nlet the fun begin.” And sure enough, Netfolks could print out pictures\r\nof the villains, each of whom had a superimposed picture of a dartboard\r\nand the wonderful caption: “The only losers are the fans.”\r\n\r\nThe _N & O_ also shared with the Net a variety of other material, of\r\nwhich my favorite was North Carolina Discoveries. A lively feature\r\nwriter named Julie Ann Powers sought out offbeat places. In Lake Norman,\r\nfor example, she found that “houses and hangars ring the airstrip and\r\neach lot comes with a grass taxiway to the paved and lighted runway.” In\r\nOrient, a hamburger-and-hot-dog cook named Red Lee claimed that at\r\ntwenty-five cents each, his offerings were the cheapest in the country.\r\nAnd in Tryon, the publishers of the _Daily Bulletin_ said that at 8 by\r\n11 inches, their newspaper might be the smallest in the world. Powers\r\ndrove from town to town in a Ford Explorer that she had nicknamed\r\nBarlowe after Arthur Barlowe—one of the first Europeans to behold the\r\nstate of North Carolina. Barlowe was a gadgeteer’s heaven on wheels,\r\nfull of audio and video equipment. People on the Web didn’t just enjoy\r\ngloriously descriptive stories from Powers: with Mosaic-style software\r\nthey could _see_ a picture of her wearing a sun hat on a beach or gaze\r\nat sand dunes or waterfalls or whatever she happened to be writing about\r\nat the time. If they owned a sound card, they could _hear_, too. She\r\nwalked around carrying a microphone so large that it resembled a\r\nfolded-up umbrella.\r\n\r\nPowers might well be one of the first multimedia reporters to work for a\r\nNet-oriented daily newspaper. I asked her to share a few trade secrets.\r\nShe said she interviewed people twice. The first time she gathered the\r\nbasics for her regular story; the second time they spoke while tape\r\nrolled. Powers said she never knew which sounds would work out and which\r\nwouldn’t. A recording of a glorious waterfall ended up sounding like a\r\ntoilet flushing.\r\n\r\nI asked about the challenge of balancing her traditional duties as a\r\nreporter with those as an audio-oriented interviewer. Some old hands in\r\nthe _N & O_ newsroom saw the gadgetry as a threat. It was all too\r\nremindful of the days when computers were replacing typewriters in the\r\nnewsroom, and many reporters and editors balked at being typesetters.\r\nBut Powers turned the new technology to her advantage. The microphone\r\nand electronic camera—a photographer followed her around—made her more\r\naware of her surroundings and sensitive to new story angles. Once she\r\ndid a story on Ten Commandment Mountain. It was part of a Biblical theme\r\npark, a peak in western North Carolina with God’s words spelled out in\r\n“concrete letters each measuring five feet high and four feet wide.” A\r\nroar from a giant lawn mower kept drowning out the voice of the man she\r\nwas interviewing. “They always ask,” he volunteered, “how do you mow\r\nthat mountain?” Presto, she had the magic quote to use near the lead. “A\r\nspecial mower with a low center of gravity,” she revealed, “tilts and\r\nleans up and down the steep planes.”\r\n\r\nWhether reading about twenty-five-cent hamburgers or godly peaks, I\r\ncould scoot easily between pictures and words. The _N & O_ had a “North\r\nCarolina Discoveries” logo at the top of one page, a picture of Powers\r\nin the same area, and then a list of the Discoveries stories that she\r\nhad done. By clicking my mouse on a list of story headlines in blue\r\nletters, I could immediately go to the stories. When I chose “Home Sweet\r\nHangar,” I sped to the same headline atop a color photo of an aviation\r\nbuff inspecting “his Cessna 172 after rolling it out of the hangar at\r\nhis house in Lake Norman Airpark.” Yes, the caption was there too. And\r\nthen I saw the story lead with an apt quote (“It’s like being an avid\r\ngolfer and living on the golf course”) followed by a list of other\r\nitems. I could choose “Audio: Talking about life on the flight line” if\r\nI wanted to hear an interview. What’s more, if I’d set up my software, I\r\ncould even have picked “Video” and gone on to a list of short movies. I\r\nalso saw background items such as a list of “Triangle-area flight\r\nschools” and “FAA regulations: How to get your pilot’s license.” The\r\nbeauty of this arrangement was that the _N & O_ could provide all kinds\r\nof wonderful details for the interested without inflicting them on\r\nothers. Unless they mouse-clicked the appropriate words in blue letters\r\n(or whatever the special color), they would never see the material.\r\n\r\nThe _N & O_ used the same approach on news stories. When North Carolina\r\nwas about to gas a man named David Lawson, readers could click on the\r\nitem “The Lawson Execution.” They could see a schedule of the events\r\nahead—from Lawson’s removal from his cell to the EKG examination that\r\nwould help certify his death. After the Associated Press reported the\r\nexecution, readers could click on a headline and read the details. They\r\ncould even summon up “Preparing for the execution” or “How the gas\r\nchamber works.”\r\n\r\nThe Lawson story was a just a sample—the _N & O_ at the time wasn’t\r\nconstantly doing multimedia on breaking news—but it was easy to envision\r\nthe future for American newspapers using the Web. Imagine the blessings\r\nfor journalists who wanted to write on neat little odds and ends without\r\ngetting in the way of their main articles. They could merely add “links”\r\nto offshoot stories. Perhaps the reader could even click and summon up a\r\ncollateral audio report or even a video. At first it might be hard to do\r\nall this on deadline, but links would be a cinch as software improved.\r\nWhat’s more, newspaper writers might evolve into true personalities just\r\nlike their counterparts on television. After all, if a reporter’s byline\r\nwere in blue letters, you could click your mouse to see a photo and\r\nmaybe even a bio featuring credentials—you could find out, for example,\r\nif the legal reporter held a law degree. You could also quickly locate\r\ncopies of earlier work or a list of his or her favorite books.\r\n\r\nGranted, electronic newspapers posed new challenges. Not all stories\r\nlent themselves to multimedia, for example. What if newspapers played\r\ndown those that didn’t? “If you tried to do that with a lot of news\r\nstories,” Julie Powers told me, “you would end up serving the video\r\nmasters rather than the news functions.” Still, in the end, the reader\r\nwould enjoy far more choices than before.\r\n\r\nThe Web, as I saw it, held out yet other possibilities for local papers\r\nsuch as the _N & O_. Suppose you lived in Chapel Hill and wanted to see\r\nwhat news had happened there in the past 24 hours; you could click on a\r\nmap of the Raleigh area and behold a story list from your town.\r\nNeighborhood-level submaps could show still more. You could read the\r\nmost minor tidbits—for example, new requests for zoning changes or items\r\nfrom neighborhood newsletters. Even more helpful, you could find old\r\nstories and other background information. Let’s say you were shopping\r\nfor a condo on a certain street. You might think the neighborhood was\r\nsafe—Chapel Hill is a university town, remember—but learn that many\r\ncrimes had occurred nearby. Furthermore, you could adjust the _kind_ of\r\ninformation that you summoned from the Web. For example, you could see\r\nlists of houses for sale in a neighborhood and then retrieve their\r\nphotos along with audio sales presentations. Moving on to another\r\ninformation category, you could uncover lists of nearby stores or see\r\ntest scores from the closest elementary school. And you might even see\r\nads from nearby restaurants and click on them to order.\r\n\r\nThe food-related examples weren’t entirely hypothetical; Zonker Harris\r\npointed me toward me some mock ads from Hardee’s and a chain called\r\nLittle Caesar’s Pizza. The same business principles I discussed in\r\nchapter 2 applied here. Rather than planning to inflict vast quantities\r\nof material on the unwilling, the _N & O_ made the ads useful and\r\nentertaining. Elsewhere in the _N & O_ area I saw an ad for a computer\r\ndealer, among others, but the real triumph was the area from Mammoth\r\nRecords—with home pages for bands, promo photos, discographies, tour\r\ndates, album covers, and more, including a catalogue and, yes, free\r\nsamples.\r\n\r\nBut what about the economics of all this? Via an electronic edition the\r\n_N & O_ wouldn’t collect the fifty cents it charged per hard copy issue,\r\nbut it wouldn’t have to buy newsprint and distribution services. _That_\r\nwas how George Schlukbier hoped the newspaper would turn a profit\r\neventually. The electronic activities, although not yet profitable as a\r\nwhole, were coming along. People on the Net, for example, were calling\r\nup the pages within the _N & O_’s area several hundred thousand times a\r\nweek. A page was what you saw when you clicked the mouse to call up an\r\nitem, and each page could be just a few lines of information, or go on\r\nfor a number of screens. Zonker Harris expected that by the end of 1994\r\nas many people would be dialing up the _N & O_ as called up SunSite UNC,\r\nthe popular collection of files at the University of North Carolina.\r\nReaders retrieved Mammoth Record’s pages some 35,000 times a week. That\r\ndidn’t mean 35,000 people—there was plenty of repeat business, and of\r\ncourse the same people looked at more than one page—but the numbers\r\nlooked good as a start.\r\n\r\nJust who, however, was reading the Web areas of the _N & O_ and other\r\nInternet publications? The _Washington Post_ and many other dailies had\r\nchosen to avoid the Net for the moment because they thought that the\r\nright people weren’t there. And some marketers and journalists tried to\r\nreinforce such arguments by citing a study of 4,777 Web readers by\r\nresearchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Ninety-four percent\r\nwere men, and 56 percent were 21-30 years old—almost half were students\r\nor faculty members or had other university ties. “These are hardly the\r\ntype of people to make large consumer or business purchases,” a _San\r\nFrancisco Chronicle_ story observed. The experience of JoAnn and Bob\r\nLilienfeld, as recounted in chapter 2, showed that riches would not\r\nautomatically come to merchants on the Web. And yet the potential was\r\nthere. The Web readers uncovered by the institute weren’t charity\r\ncases—just yups. Studying the readers of the Baseball server, the _N &\r\nO_ found they were a long way from poverty. Twenty percent of these\r\nNetfolks, for example, earned $35,000-$50,000 a year, 18 percent earned\r\n$50,000-$75,000, and 4 percent earned more than $75,000. And, of course,\r\nmany of these Netfolks were young people who would carry their Net habit\r\nover to their jobs and their personal lives. Not surprisingly,\r\nSchlukbier claimed keen interest from representatives of companies such\r\nas J.C. Penney and Radio Shack, and, of course, from fast-food chains,\r\nwhich, in so many cases, targeted their ads at the young.\r\n\r\nCleverly the _N & O_ built on existing relationships with advertisers.\r\nIf you were already on the paper and bought _X_ number of lines, then\r\nyou could get the Net as a bonus. North Carolina businesses paid as\r\nlittle as $50 a month in basic fees to be in the _N & O_’s area on the\r\nNet, not including add-ons such as design services. Big national firms\r\nwould pay well into the thousands. Given the newness of the medium, this\r\nwould scare off many—unless, like the _N & O_ itself, they saw the Net\r\nas an investment in the future. Then the experiment might work. In my\r\nmind, however, there was one other variable: What about _national_\r\npublications competing with local papers for the same _national_\r\nadvertisers? Already Time Warner and the _N & O_ were watching each\r\nother carefully.\r\n\r\nMagazines: Time Warner\r\n\r\nTyping away on Macintoshes on the fortieth floor of the Time Life\r\nBuilding in Manhattan, ten floors above _People_ magazine, a small team\r\nstarted an area of the Web known as Pathfinder. It offered electronic\r\nversions of Time Warner’s vast stable of magazines. Zonker Harris at the\r\n_N & O_ had a slogan, “May the best server win.” The Durham newspapers\r\nmight not be in the game so far, but _Time_ and brethren were.\r\n\r\nZonker was justifiably proud of the 300,000 or so accesses a week that\r\nthe _N & O_’s Web area was enjoying after several months on the Web. But\r\njust within a week of start-up in fall 1994, the Time Warner area was\r\ndrawing more than 80,000 accesses a _day_. That didn’t mean that the _N\r\n& O_’s efforts were doomed—hardly. But despite all the talk about the\r\nNet being nirvana for smaller companies, Fortune 500 corporations\r\narrived with some advantages of their own. Once readers grew comfortable\r\nwith a certain area of the Web, they might spend less time on other\r\nparts of the Net. This wasn’t so much a pattern at the time, but as mass\r\naudiences descended on the Net, corporate logos might count far more.\r\nBeyond that, Time Warner already offered a daily version of _Time_—a\r\n_newspaper_ in effect. It was just one service among a rackfull of\r\npublications. Readers could read up on foreign policy or the latest\r\n_Star Trek_ film in _Time_, take in reviews from _Entertainment Weekly_,\r\nkeep up with Ice-T and other hip-hop musicians in _Vibe_, or fire off\r\nquestions to authors of best-sellers from Warner Books.\r\n\r\nAn even greater threat to the _N & O_, in the long run, was the fact\r\nthat Time Warner didn’t just own magazines and book publishers. It also\r\nowned _pipes_, including a cable operation in the Raleigh area. And\r\nsomeday it might use cable TV lines to send the Net into homes there,\r\ncompeting with the _N & O_, which had already been providing Internet\r\nservices. If no antitrust or other legal boundaries existed, then Time\r\nWarner would be remiss in its duties to its stockholders if it did not\r\nexplore this route. Think what this would mean to users of the World\r\nWide Web. If an article came with fancy photos, they might have to wait\r\nseveral minutes for the whole works to reach them at a speed of 14.4\r\nkilobits per second. But suppose Time Warner used cable TV to bring the\r\nInternet to them. Their televisions would still work with cable the\r\nusual way. But their computers could share the cable and retrieve Web\r\narticles and other material in a fraction of the time. Cable modems sold\r\nfor hundreds of dollars. But pilot projects were going on with other\r\ncompanies, and the cost could soon drop to a fraction of that amount.\r\nMore important, big, well-financed corporations might be willing to\r\nmodify the old cable for these new capabilities.[4.15] What did this\r\nmean for local, _N & O_-sized companies? Just as high tech had blurred\r\nthe difference between telephones and televisions, the Net itself was\r\nblurring the barriers between local and national. It was unclear whether\r\nthe public would win or lose.\r\n\r\nFor better or worse, Time Warner’s area on the Net was part of an\r\nevolution in cyberspace. The process had begun with the small academic\r\nmagazines and hobbyist publications that turned to the Net as a cheap\r\nway to find readers. Many if not most still relied on plain text without\r\ngraphics; they were little more than archived dispatches to mailing\r\nlists—which was fine because the words mattered above all. One of the\r\nbest of these was Adam Engst’s _Tidbits_. Written for Apple owners, it\r\nalso appeared on the World Wide Web and bulletin board systems, and\r\nEngst claimed more than 100,000 readers—no small feat for a\r\nkitchen-table-style publisher. Nonconglomerates still provided most of\r\nthe magazines on the net, and not all were for techies or sci-fi buffs.\r\n_International Teletimes_ was edited by Ian Wojtowicz, a gifted high\r\nschool student who lived in Vancouver, British Columbia. _Teletimes_\r\nwent out over the Web with fetching art, not just text, and some of the\r\nprose could have graced _Harper’s_ or the _Atlantic_. Recounting a\r\nwinter trip by train, a college student named Paul Gribble wrote: “Every\r\nnow and then we pass a lake, completely frozen over, flat and white,\r\nsmooth as a skating rink. I’d love to walk to the center of a big frozen\r\nlake like that and just sit there for a while. I’d feel like the first\r\nblot of paint on a fresh silk canvas.”\r\n\r\nMany steps up from _Teletimes_, in business terms, was _Global Net\r\nNavigator_. Like the _N & O_ in North Carolina, _GNN_ was trying to use\r\nadvertising to support its activities, and you could see ads from\r\ncompanies as large as Digital Equipment Corporation. _GNN_ was not just\r\ntechnical. It posted informative, brightly written articles on topics\r\nranging from money to food and travel. _Wired_ magazine was on the Net,\r\ntoo, with an offshoot called _HotWired_, which itself wandered far from\r\ntechnical topics and attracted lucrative ads from the likes of Volvo and\r\nAT&T. None of these publications, of course, happened to be a Household\r\nName like Time Warner’s _Time_ or _People_. Many experts felt that as a\r\nprofitable medium for big-time magazines—and let’s not confuse size with\r\nquality or lack thereof—the Internet had a long way to go.\r\n\r\nJeffrey Dearth offered at least an interim answer. Teaming up with a\r\nsmall corporation with the grand name of the Internet Company, Dearth\r\noffered the Electronic Newsstand. Like the Pathfinder or _N & O_’s Net\r\nedition, the Newsstand was a godsend to browsers. You could wander\r\nthrough sample articles from _Business Week_; _Field & Stream_; _The\r\nEconomist_; _The New Yorker_; _National Review_; _Maclean’s_, Canada’s\r\nlargest newsweekly; or The _New Republic_, of which Dearth himself was\r\npublisher. The Time Warner experiment notwithstanding, most of the Names\r\nwere far behind. Dearth offered them the equivalent of a catch-up course\r\nor at least some solid remedial instruction. They could test the waters\r\nof the Net to see how much interest their articles drew, before deciding\r\nwhether to set up their own areas there. Via the Newsstand, magazines\r\ncould accept subscription orders.\r\n\r\nBut order taking was a long way from fancier “interactivity”—to use a\r\npet term of media people—and this was where Time Warner’s Pathfinder\r\narea would shine. The area didn’t just recycle magazines on the Net, it\r\nalso offered powerful tools to find old articles by typing in search\r\nwords or the names of topics. From the start, the searching capability\r\nwas among the more popular services. Soon Pathfinder would include\r\nhypertext links that let you go from an article on a certain topic to an\r\nongoing discussion. Already Time Warner provided special services such\r\nas one for gardeners. They could type in their general wishes about\r\nflowers and supply their location and other odds and ends, and then Time\r\nwould offer tips on what to grow. It also allowed inquirers find out how\r\ntheir congressman or senator had voted on certain key issues. And many\r\nmore applications like this were on the way. What’s more, people could\r\ntalk back to Time Warner writers and others by way of an advanced\r\nbulletin board system designed for the Web. It was _much_ easier to use\r\nthan the _N & O_’s.\r\n\r\nNot everyone liked the Web area. One woman hated the “overstuffed”\r\nartwork—others said it gobbled up too much downloading time. She also\r\nchided _Time_ for putting out the online version of _Sunset_ magazine\r\n“for Northern Californians still living in their ’50s ranch houses.” I\r\nmyself, however, enjoyed the kitsch and flashy, busy look of the Web\r\narea as a whole. That was the way the _real_ magazines came across; this\r\nwas pop culture, not the _Kenyon Review_.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately the _Time_ board teemed with lively talk on issues\r\nranging from Clintonian stupidities to, yes, the future of the\r\nelectronic medium. I felt much more comfortable here than in the message\r\narea of the _N & O_; people on the _Time_ board spoke their minds more\r\nfreely. Some amusing posts showed up. Amazingly, the software let people\r\nkey in their own identities, and the late Henry Luce, cofounder of\r\n_Time_, arose from the grave as luce@pastmytime.com. One message\r\nappeared, truthfully or not, with the name of a staffer at _U.S. News &\r\nWorld Report_. He promised that _U.S. News_ would set up an outpost on\r\nthe Net soon, and someone at _Time_ twitted him for not answering e-mail\r\npromptly. Despite my fondness for the reporting in _U.S. News_, I had to\r\nagree. Researching a Net guide for political activists, I’d written\r\n_U.S. News_ six months ago and had yet to receive an answer.\r\n\r\nTime Warner also showed network savvy by following the example of _GNN_\r\nand similar publications and providing some hypertext pointers to the\r\nrest of the Internet, rather than expecting readers to stay within its\r\nown area. Time Warner even enlisted some of its household names in the\r\ncause. The electronic version of _Entertainment Weekly_, for example,\r\ndid not just review Madonna or Springsteen or the latest Hollywood\r\nfilms; it also directed people to popular, entertainment-oriented sites\r\non the Net itself by way of hypertext links. I still wanted to see many,\r\nmany more links—a strength of _GNN_. But I suspected that would come in\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nPlanning the Pathfinder service, Time Warner had even consulted with the\r\npublisher of _Wired_. “They’re providing real news, not just PR blather\r\nor sales areas for their products,” said Chip Bayers, the managing\r\neditor of _HotWired_, the _Wired_ offshoot on the Web. And he was right.\r\n\r\nI myself was no cheerleader for Time Warner in some ways—I worried about\r\nmedia concentrations.[4.16] But here the Suits deserved their due.\r\n_HotWired_ offered avant-garde graphics on the Web along with services\r\nsuch as bulletin boards and free archives; I was pleased, yet hardly\r\nsurprised. _Wired_, after all, was still a bit of an upstart despite\r\nheavy investment from a corporate arm of the powerful Newhouse\r\nfamily.[4.17] But Time Warner was different—the epitome of the\r\njournalistic and Hollywood establishments, a company with many benefits\r\nfrom the status quo. I recalled the upbeat stories that _Time_ had run\r\nabout the world of 500-channel television. Such articles betrayed far\r\nmore tolerance of the “one to many” broadcast model, as opposed to the\r\nnewer, more anarchistic model of the Net. Many in the Time Life tower,\r\nespecially on the entertainment side, might still harbor these less\r\nadventurous visions. And yet the company was now spreading its bets\r\naround. That seemed sensible enough, given the chilliness that some test\r\nmarkets had shown interactive TV.\r\n\r\nA _Time_ writer named Philip Elmer-DeWitt had grown more and more\r\nattuned to the potential of the Net. He was a regular on The WELL, the\r\nbulletin board system frequented by many of the elite journalists on the\r\nInternet. Again and again Elmer-DeWitt showed up on newsgroups and\r\nmailing lists with spunky, opinionated posts on such topics as the media\r\nand telecommunications. He lent his name to a successful legal campaign\r\nto aid Brock Meeks, a small publisher on the Net who faced a libel suit\r\nfrom a mail-order tycoon in Ohio. What’s more, Elmer-DeWitt was\r\nsensitive to the threats from the Clipper chip, which Washington might\r\nuse someday to invade the privacy of millions of Americans. He clearly\r\nrepresented the interests of his employer, but he did so with a good mix\r\nof wit and smarts that endeared him to many on the Internet. His\r\nelectronic signature said, “Read Time on America Online where we are\r\npaid to take abuse.”\r\n\r\nEnlivened by posts from Netfolks and WELLfolks whom Elmer-DeWitt had\r\nbefriended, _Time_’s message board thrived on America Online. But now,\r\nquite correctly, _Time_ had run an article pointing out the advantages\r\nof the Internet from the perspective of publishers. _Time_ raised a big\r\nquestion, the same one Frank Daniels had asked. Did publications really\r\nhave to fork over such a hefty percentage of their online revenue to\r\ncommercial services, such as America Online, when the Internet existed?\r\nTime Warner’s well-stocked area on the Net was itself an answer of\r\nsorts. Granted, the company’s outpost on America Online wasn’t about to\r\nvanish. Time Warner was testing both interactive TV and computers as\r\ntransmission vehicles; similarly the company was not committing itself\r\nto any single network in cyberspace. I took it for granted that sooner\r\nor later Time Warner might end up on the network that Bill Gates was\r\nstarting. Just as _Time_ reached newsstands everywhere, the electronic\r\nequivalent could seek out eyes wherever the phone lines led. _Sports\r\nIllustrated_, _Fortune_, and _People_ would soon be on CompuServe. And\r\nyet Time Warner’s priority in the computer world was clear: the Internet\r\nabove all else, at least for the moment.\r\n\r\n“When we put _Time_ on America Online,” said Walter Isaacson, editor of\r\nnew media at Time, “it is done on their server, using their software,\r\nand only someone subscribing to America Online and using America Online\r\nsoftware can access it. On the Web, anyone using public domain software\r\ncan get to it.” I could just have substituted “_News & Observer_” for\r\n“_Time_,” an impression only strengthened by the next sentence: “We have\r\na direct relationship to our readers.” Isaacson went on: “There will be\r\nmassive amounts more content from Time Inc. on the Web than on America\r\nOnline or CompuServe, which will just feature individual magazines.”\r\n\r\nSome twenty-two magazines were to go on the Web. Isaacson said around\r\nten editors would participate full or part time. Total investment in the\r\nWeb site was to reach the “mid six figures,” and “with advertising it\r\nshould be in the black within a year.” “There may be a mix of ads and\r\nsubscription fees,” Isaacson said. Mercifully, the advertising would not\r\nbe the intrusive Prodigy kind that popped up on the bottom of my screen\r\nin a garish, Vegas style.\r\n\r\nJim Kinsella, the ex-newspaper editor who presided over the Web area,\r\nsaid he was pushing for a subscription fee of around $8 a month. I would\r\nhave wanted the price to be a few dollars lower, but it was fine if I\r\ngot enough for my money. If nothing else, Kinsella wanted readers to be\r\nable to stay online without the time charges that made thousands unplug\r\ntheir hookups with America Online and similar services. A product\r\nmanager with Microsoft would later say as much to the _New York Times_\r\nin discussing Bill Gates’ new service: “We’re trying to reduce the\r\nthreshold of pain. We think users hate connect fees.”[4.18]\r\n\r\nKinsella’s $8 monthly fee—his proposed figure, not Time Warner’s—would\r\nbe for Pathfinder itself, not for the Internet connection. I did some\r\nquick math. Pathfinder could indeed be a competitive possibility if Time\r\nWarner were able to lower the cost of using the Internet by way of cable\r\ntelevision from the $75-$100 a month that people typically paid for such\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\nMass use might enable Time Warner to undercut the $20 that the _N & O_\r\npresently charged. Typical readers might want to keep reading a _local_\r\nnewspaper, and the _N & O_ could drop its own prices, but this was still\r\na good example of how national media just might drain at least some\r\nreaders away from the local media. Understandably, Kinsella was thinking\r\nin mass, national terms, as I would have done. He predicted that within\r\nfive or ten years half the country might be able to reach the Net in one\r\nway or another. Others at Time were similarly optimistic.\r\n\r\nNot everyone in late 1994 was so sanguine. Mark Stahlman, for example, a\r\nmedia expert in New York, shrugged off Net publications as “just the\r\nlatest in a series of fads.” Richard M. Smith, _Newsweek_’s editor in\r\nchief who was running the new-media committee of the Magazine Publishers\r\nof America, was skeptical about online services in general: “The people\r\nwho are making money are the people who are running conferences about\r\nit.”[4.19]\r\n\r\nSmith was oversimplifying somewhat, but formidable barriers did exist,\r\nof which one of the biggest happened to be the limits of the technology.\r\nReading electronic text for hours on end could be murder on both the\r\nback and the eyes. All day long I sat in front of a computer screen; the\r\nlast thing I wanted was to have to do it while I wandered through\r\nmagazines or books. Television wouldn’t do: I hated the idea of reading\r\na magazine or novel from ten feet away. Besides, didn’t magazines and\r\nbooks exist to be enjoyed in bed, on the hammock, or at the beach?\r\n\r\nMightn’t Silicon Valley, however, come out with small, tablet-style\r\ncomputers designed for reading? “TeleReaders” could feature optional\r\nkeyboards for people who wanted to use them as general purpose\r\ncomputers. Screens, needless to say, must be much sharper than today,\r\nand without so much flicker. Batteries should last longer. And, ideally,\r\nyou should be able to dart from place to place in a newspaper or\r\nmagazine by merely touching a “pen” to the appropriate part of your\r\nscreen. _That_ was what the magazine, newspaper, and book industries\r\nneeded, rather than just more conferences. Washington could even\r\nencourage this by way of a focused procurement program for schools and\r\nlibraries; the same machines could even be used for electronic forms for\r\ngovernment and commerce.\r\n\r\nRoger Fidler of Knight-Ridder had already been experimenting with\r\nmockups of tablet-style machines. He was more interested in a\r\nnewspaper-oriented approach and less in a general one than I was. But\r\nthe basic idea was the same—words needn’t be captives of the printed\r\npage. The real question was this: How soon until the right technology\r\nappeared? Electronic magazines such as Time Warner’s would still make\r\nmoney without a TeleRead-style approach, but the full potential would\r\nnot be reached, especially if more children abandoned words for TV and\r\ncomputer images. That was even truer for the world of books. Even more\r\nthan magazines and newspapers, e-books suffered from the limits of\r\ntechnology. It wasn’t just a question of the right machine for viewing;\r\nat issue were other matters such as copy protection and billing. But at\r\nleast some partial solutions were on the way, and even with the present\r\ndifficulties of the medium, online bookstores were sprouting up on the\r\nInternet. One of the best was run by Laura Fillmore, an editor in\r\nMassachusetts who had once worked for Little, Brown.\r\n\r\nBooks: Laura Fillmore and\r\nthe Online Bookstore\r\n\r\nAn elderly man owned a charming old store in a southern town with the\r\nstandard magnolias, wrought iron staircases, and hot, moist summers, and\r\nhe loved to brag about his shiny new safe. Most customers did not know\r\nabout it or care. Rather than worrying so much about the protection of\r\nhis wealth, he might have been better off to imitate his rivals and\r\ninvest his money in air-conditioning instead of the safe.\r\n\r\nThe man reminded me of myopic publishers and authors. Not quite grasping\r\nthe full potential of the Internet, they fretted too much about\r\ncopyright protection, and not enough about making their wares friendly\r\nto shoppers. A pay-per-read company in Virginia was typical here. You\r\ncould download its books off the Internet, but you did not enjoy such\r\nniceties as links to other titles online. Nor could you print more than\r\na page or so at once. Beyond that, you had to clutter up your computer\r\nsystem with a $25 gadget hooked up to the printer port. If you were\r\nworking on tight deadlines and were rich and desperate enough, you might\r\nstomach this copy protection system. But I dreaded the possibility of\r\nits adoption by the book industry as a whole; established publishers and\r\nwriters just might see the world pass them by if they cared too much\r\nabout cybersafes and not enough about customer amenities. Many megabytes\r\nof good, free reading awaited the public on the Web, and not everyone\r\nunderstood the value that professional editors and writers could add.\r\n\r\nNowadays, however, more publishers and hangers-on were catching on to\r\nthe nuances of the Net. Among them was Laura Fillmore, a publishing\r\nconsultant who owned the Online BookStore in Rockport, Massachusetts.\r\nShe must have driven some traditionalists crazy. Fillmore actually had\r\nthe notion that ASCII—text in a popular format, without italics and the\r\nother trimmings—should be free to everyone. She loved Project Gutenberg,\r\nwhich an Illinois academic had started to put classics and other works\r\non the Net at no charge. Fillmore was the antithesis of a techno-geek,\r\nthe kind of woman who just might read Dickens to her two children on\r\nsnowy days, and who was a regular on the speaker circuit within her\r\nindustry. She had majored in English at Barnard College and worked for a\r\npublishing company that dated back to the nineteenth century. Fillmore\r\nhelped bridge the past and the electronic era. Her vision wasn’t quite\r\nthe same as mine, but it was worlds apart from that of piracy-fixated\r\npublishers who saw electronic readers as a criminal class.\r\n\r\nThe move to the Net was, in her opinion, part of a long evolution toward\r\na new form of decentralized publishing. She recalled when the great\r\nhouses didn’t farm out editing and other tasks as often as they do\r\ntoday, and when almost every book took nine months to reach the stores.\r\n“Back in the late ’70s when I was at Little, Brown,” she said, “we\r\nneeded to get special permission to use Ex. When an author wanted his\r\nsales figures, I’d walk up the street to the top floor of a separate\r\nbuilding where Rose, the lady with the P & L cards, had been keeping\r\ntabs for twenty years, and I’d sign out the neatly penciled card and\r\ncarefully carry it to my boss, wrapping it in plastic against the\r\nweather if necessary. I passed the copyediting department with their\r\nwell-stocked reference library, a bastion against inaccuracies, and the\r\ndesign department, smelling of wax, hung with rulers, sizing wheels, and\r\nX-acto knives.”[4.20] The industry, though, had changed; now freelancers\r\nthroughout the country, not just in New York or Boston, were often\r\nediting and even publishing books. Fillmore herself had gone into\r\nfreelance editorial work years before, and she still remembered “the\r\nshrinking feeling in my stomach the first time I bought a computer setup\r\nback in 1984: $10,000 of the bank’s money for an XT and an HP LaserJet.\r\nThe salesman left, I was back at the C prompt, and the room grew dark.\r\nNo matter which buttons I pushed, ‘Abort, Retry, Ignore’ glared back\r\npersistently. Finally, I chose none of the above and unplugged the whole\r\nthing.”[4.21] Fillmore overcame her technophobia, but the chaos of\r\nchange still made her uncomfortable. “Increasing speed and volume have\r\nled to high job turnover, a blurring of disciplines. Our computerized\r\ntools allow the editor to become a typist, a designer, and a\r\ntype-setter, the designer becomes a software junkie, a graphic artist, a\r\nprepress house. No time for galleys! Straight to pages! No time for\r\npages; straight to film. The drop dead date is bottom line. Sales are\r\nneeded this quarter.”[4.22]\r\n\r\nYears ago, competition had reached the point where many typesetting jobs\r\nleft the United States. “We even hired freelancers thirdhand in\r\nSingapore and Haiti,” Fillmore recalled in a speech. “The publisher\r\nhired me; I hired someone stateside to hire someone in-country to hire\r\nthe keyboarder and, still, the publisher ended paying maybe half what\r\nthe job would have cost him at $15 per hour. Our topic today is\r\nslavery.”[4.23]\r\n\r\nBut in Fillmore’s opinion, this distributed form of publishing, where\r\ntasks went every which way, would take a newer and more humane form. In\r\nthe 1980s books had appeared on computer networking, a kinder technology\r\nthan the brutal, production-oriented variety of the past. And now\r\nFillmore saw in networks a chance to “elicit life from people” who used\r\ncomputers to communicate. Her own “epiphany” came when a Net-oriented\r\nwriter, John Quarterman, author of _The Matrix_, introduced her to “the\r\nthen alien concept of electronic mail. My assistant would pick up mail\r\nfrom my lone correspondent, the author, print it out, put it in my in\r\nbox, and I would handwrite responses which she would input and send back\r\nin due time. It sounds quaint, but it seemed to make sense to me at the\r\ntime—in the same way computerized typesetting distributed though\r\nunconnected PCs made sense.” On the Net, everyone could publish, not\r\njust giant publishing houses. And so Quarterman could forward to her\r\nsome public messages from students who were defying the Chinese Army in\r\nTiananmen Square. They could speak for themselves; no one edited them.\r\nThey weren’t like the freelance typists in Haiti: They were not “hidden\r\nand voiceless behind four middlemen” and “with no hope of a phone, much\r\nless an Internet connection.”[4.24]\r\n\r\nThe overlap in Fillmore’s mind, between publishing and communicating via\r\nthe Net, was entirely natural. When the Haitians typed, they created a\r\ndigitized version of the book they were working on. They were not just\r\ntransferring words to paper. Bits and bytes, once created, could go\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\nFillmore, of course, was hardly the first to think of consolidating\r\nknowledge. As early as 1945 a scientist had published a preternaturally\r\nfarsighted _Atlantic Monthly_ article that was to electronic publishing\r\nwhat Leonardo da Vinci’s notebooks were to inventions in general.\r\nVannevar Bush had proposed a memex, a microfilm-based device that could\r\nbring together knowledge from many disciplines—along with the thoughts\r\nof the user. It would be, in other words, a cross between a personal\r\nfile cabinet and a giant library. In a speech, Fillmore quoted a key\r\npassage: “The human mind ... operates by association. With one item in\r\nits grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the\r\nassociation of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails\r\ncovered by the brain.”[4.25] Bush might as well have been describing the\r\nWorld Wide Web and its links that allow you to click on “Boeing” and see\r\n“Airplanes” or click on “Clinton” and see “Presidents.” Ted Nelson, a\r\ndreamer-writer-programmer, was thinking of the memex when he invented\r\nhypertext links. That concept, in turn, excited Tim Berners-Lee, a\r\nstaffer at a physics institute in Berne, Switzerland, who was the father\r\nof the Web—the vast network of computers through which I could retrieve\r\nthe Raleigh _News and Observer_, _Time_, and Fillmore’s offerings.\r\n\r\nBack in 1992, however, the World Wide Web was a fraction of its present\r\nsize, and programmers had yet to release easy, graphically oriented\r\nbrowsers such as Mosaic that would help tame the Web. Even more than\r\ntoday, people needed books to fathom the Net. And yet no popular-level\r\nguide was in print. So it was entirely fitting that when Fillmore\r\ndecided to create a book from scratch—rather than just produce it for a\r\npublisher—the Internet was the subject. This how-to guide was _The\r\nInternet Companion_, the author was Tracy LaQuey, and the paper\r\npublisher was Addison-Wesley. Fillmore kept the network rights and\r\nlooked forward to distributing the book through her new Online\r\nBookStore. Barry Shein of Software Tool & Die, the first commercial\r\nservice to hook ordinary mortals into the Internet, had offered her\r\nspace on his bank of hard disks. “He described his operation,” she said,\r\n“as basically an electronic store with empty shelves and a cash register\r\nat the door. I decided that I’d find electronic properties to fill these\r\nshelves.”[4.26] But the Internet at the time had Acceptable Use Policies\r\nthat prevented her from making a profit. What to do?\r\n\r\nFillmore hit on a solution that actually rewarded her for an idealistic\r\napproach to publishing. She gave away—with great luck in the end—ASCII\r\nfiles from the book in hopes of drumming up interest in the paper\r\nversion. “Who wants to read hundreds of pages in ASCII anyway?” Fillmore\r\nwould later ask. Unadorned ASCII by itself wasn’t always that pleasant\r\nto read, and many people liked the Net version well enough to shell out\r\nmoney for a paper book. “Even our publisher was supportive of our\r\neffort,” Fillmore said, “and happy with the resulting sales\r\nfigures.”[4.27] Orders poured in from as far off as Finland and Korea.\r\nNetfolks all over the world could learn of Fillmore’s offering\r\nimmediately rather than waiting for reviews to show up in local\r\nmagazines and newspapers.\r\n\r\nWithin two years, _Companion_ had sold hundreds of thousands of copies.\r\nAl Gore had written the foreword just before his election as vice\r\npresident, but the freebies on the Net certainly hadn’t hurt. Other\r\npublishers also found that free copies could be a boon, not a bane. _Zen\r\nand the Art of the Internet_ (Prentice Hall) and _The Hacker’s\r\nDictionary_ (MIT Press) similarly flew off the racks. “Giving something\r\nvaluable away for free,” Fillmore said, “can make money.”[4.28]\r\n\r\nOf course some would say she hadn’t actually published online. Rather\r\nshe had used the medium to promote a paper book. Still, the prospect of\r\npurely electronic publishing beckoned. “I was seduced by the prospect of\r\nthe then 10 million people on the Internet—10 million literate people\r\nwith disposable incomes—attached to the Net. Why not acquire lots of\r\nInternet rights to lots of books and put them online at the Online\r\nBookStore. Surely some percentage of those people would buy files of a\r\npopular author’s books for a reasonable price.”[4.29] Fillmore was\r\nsensible enough to price her offerings for consumers who were spending\r\ntheir own money, not their bosses’. Some commercial databases were\r\ncharging as much as $200 per hour or more, while Fillmore was thinking\r\nmore in terms of $5, say, for a short story downloaded from the Net.\r\n\r\nThe test story was “Umney’s Last Case,” a fifty-page Stephen King story\r\nfrom a collection called _Nightmares and Dreamscapes_. King was among\r\nthe best-selling writers on the planet. Fillmore dreamed of tens of\r\nthousands of dialups even if “Umney” intrigued only 1 percent of the 10\r\nmillion people on the Net at the time. Fillmore had picked out just the\r\nright King story, one where a time traveler gave a Toshiba T-1000 laptop\r\ncomputer to a tough detective around 1939—someone who in turn used his\r\n“plastic Buck Rogers steno machine” to write a story within King’s own\r\ntale.\r\n\r\nFillmore’s “Umney” project was a sensation at the biggest book fair in\r\nthe world, the one at Frankfurt; upbeat stories appeared in places\r\nranging from European news programs to the _Wall Street Journal_. She\r\nwitnessed “a vast amount of smoke, a tremendous marketing boost for the\r\nprinted book again, lots of noise—and by extension, lots of profit for\r\nthe publisher and for the author—but handfuls of per-copy sales.”[4.30]\r\nThey didn’t even pay for all the phone calls used to set up the deal.\r\n\r\nI was hardly surprised. Enjoying access to many megs of free material on\r\nthe Net, the typical denizen didn’t want to shell out even $5 for the\r\nstory even if she or he could simply fax in a credit card number. It\r\nwasn’t that King’s work was worthless—quite the opposite. Rather, on the\r\nInternet and with this business model, “Umney” at most any realistic\r\nprice could not compete with free material such as Usenet postings.\r\n\r\nYes, the Net teemed with sci-fi and fantasy fans. But as I saw it, they\r\nwere too busy talking to each other, and, while they would have been\r\ndelighted to download “Umney” for free, they balked at spending the $5.\r\nYou might say that “Umney” was like a typical TV program. The appeal was\r\npotentially broad but not deep. Pay-per-view wasn’t that much of a hit\r\non cable TV, and the same principle applied here. “Umney” could enhance\r\na collection of material for subscribers—we go back to the flat-fee\r\nexample of the _News & Observer_ and Jim Kinsella’s vision for Time\r\nWarner—but even a Stephen King story wasn’t strong enough on its own for\r\nonline use. Part of the problem, I believed, was the medium. The right\r\ntechnology for reading fifty-page short stories just wasn’t out there\r\nyet. With the proper equipment, the value would increase.\r\n\r\nBesides, even now, Fillmore could use a license or sponsorship model.\r\nShe sold “Umney” to two computer networks, one of them CompuServe, which\r\ngained the right to post the story for a week during a conference on\r\npaperless publishing. “Hundreds of people have accessed it,” Fillmore\r\nsaid. The future possibilities were evident now. Corporations someday\r\nmight sponsor books on computer networks the way they sponsored programs\r\non CBS or NBC. In fact, whole sites on the Net—with the names of\r\ncompanies—could serve as homes for innovative projects. Sun Microsystems\r\nwas oriented toward UNIX, relied heavily on sales to Net users, and\r\nbenefited from the goodwill and publicity that its SunSite libraries\r\nenjoyed. Fare ranged from presidential speeches to the Internet\r\nUnderground Music Archive; there could be a place for commercial e-books\r\nas well in these high-tech sandboxes, as Fillmore jokingly called such\r\nareas.\r\n\r\nThe sponsorship model wasn’t perfect, of course. Fillmore herself was\r\nthe first to wonder which corporations would have sponsored writings\r\nabout the uprising in Tiananmen Square. Big companies often favored\r\nupbeat material. As I saw it, fiction and nonfiction books alike might\r\nsuffer if this model alone prevailed. They differed from newspapers and\r\nmagazines; book publishers thought more in terms of individual\r\nproperties, and beyond that, publications such as the _N & O_ and _Time_\r\nalready enjoyed strong identities from their paper incarnations. The new\r\nmedia were less a challenge to their editorial integrity. But many\r\nsponsored books might degenerate into the Net equivalent of the wretched\r\ninfomercials on TV, the ones where over-the-hill actors “interviewed”\r\nastrologers or memory experts, and where the audiences clapped\r\nthunderously on cue.\r\n\r\nWisely, Fillmore did not give up on “Umney” entirely—it was still online\r\nwhen I was writing this chapter—nor did she quit using the Net to\r\npromote writings on paper. Even more important, she tried out writings\r\nthat took advantage of links to other material on the Web.\r\n\r\n_Bless This Food: Amazing Grace in Praise of Food_ was an example of\r\nprime material for hypertext. The paper book bought together\r\nfood-related prayers from many times and places. But everything was\r\ncontained. You couldn’t wander outside the printed pages. Thanks to\r\nFillmore, however, you could click on Buddhist-related material and see\r\na Buddha’s image piped in from the Smithsonian. You could even e-mail\r\nthe author of _Bless_, Adrian Butash. Fillmore wasn’t just selling the\r\nbook itself—she was offering it as a “dashboard” that could take you to\r\nrelated material on the Net. Certainly the Smithsonian hadn’t had\r\n_Bless_ in mind when it posted the picture of Buddha. However, through\r\nthe pointers in the electronic edition, you could learn of this image\r\nand view it in just the right context; that, after all, was the splendor\r\nof the Web. Quite honestly, then, Fillmore could charge $25 for a book\r\nthat sold in hardback from Delacorte for $18.95. She was giving you\r\n_more_ for your money. Besides, if you proposed new links and she liked\r\nthem, you would receive some royalties. You, the reader, could be part\r\nof the book and the author’s life. We could all be editors.\r\n\r\nAs a writer, I had somewhat mixed feelings about this. I loved e-mail\r\nfrom readers. But I was already spending too many hours a day on\r\nelectronic correspondence of one kind or another. I hated the idea of\r\nsuffering a constant stream of e-mail from Project X when I wanted to\r\nmove on to Project Y. If this model won out, writers would have to be\r\nmuch choosier about the projects they took on—knowing that publishers\r\nexpected more commitment.\r\n\r\nGiven the deluge of 50,000 titles a year that readers face just from\r\nU.S. publishers, more than a few people would enjoy such a prospect. But\r\nthey shouldn’t grow too complacent. With electronic publishing much\r\ncheaper than the paper variety, we might eventually see 100,000\r\ncommercially published titles a year. I, for one, wouldn’t mind as long\r\nas quality and royalties don’t suffer. The problem is not too many\r\nbooks, but rather the need for better software to sort through them—or\r\nfor more hypertext editors to issue good pointers. That is one reason\r\nwhy I loved the idea of publishers selling pointers as well as actual\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nNot every writer would be open-minded, of course; even Fillmore at first\r\nhad feared hypertext. When O’Reilly and Associates put one of her papers\r\non the Web through _GNN_—spreading around her observations on electronic\r\npublishing—she saw all kinds of links. By clicking on blue letters, for\r\nexample, readers would call up material about a founder of Internet.\r\nFillmore felt as if a Philistine had taken her beautiful bowl, her\r\nself-contained piece of writing, and turned it into a colander. Some\r\nwriters might see a parallel in another way: Suppose the colander leaked\r\nreaders, who, seeing the links, dove off into another area of the Net,\r\nand _never_ returned. Fillmore had adjusted to this possibility, and I\r\ncould, too. Just like Zonker Harris I was of the “May the best server\r\nwin!” mentality, except that I refused to confuse popularity with merit.\r\nBooks weren’t like sports servers.\r\n\r\nFrom society’s viewpoint, another issue presented itself here. Both\r\nFillmore and I wondered about the damage that television and computers\r\nmight be doing to people’s attention spans. “Attention deficit disorder\r\nseems to have arisen at the same time that computers have spread to the\r\nhome and office,” she said, “and I don’t think that’s an accident. How\r\nmany people age twelve and younger are capable of reading 300 pages of\r\nsustained argument about anything?” Another worry arose, too, in my\r\nmind. Like Frank Daniels, I realized that an entire generation of\r\nchildren was spending more time gazing at computer and TV screens than\r\nthey devoted to books and traditional newspapers.\r\n\r\nI felt that technology was destiny, that Washington and other\r\ngovernments should promote computers that encouraged the receptive to\r\nread e-books hour after hour. Too much of the new-style education, as\r\nenvisioned by many, would be task oriented—would be _training_ as much\r\nas _education_ per se. That was fine for technical matters where, for\r\nexample, a future factory worker might want to learn the basics of\r\nengine design. Hypertext was superb. The student could study a diagram\r\nof a diesel engine, click on an individual part, and read and hear a\r\ndetailed explanation of its function. But I wanted technology that also\r\nencouraged people to read and absorb whole books.\r\n\r\nIf book readers were too small a minority, then countries such as the\r\nUnited States would be less democratic and more oligarchic, with the\r\nelite all too able to manipulate the other citizens. Some social critics\r\nsuch as Neil Postman demonized technology as a source of mindless\r\ndistractions for the masses. I, however, saw opportunity if we acted\r\nsoon enough before we lost more children to TV. That meant sharp\r\nscreens, smaller, lighter machines, and other advances—which would come\r\nsooner or later, but which could be hastened by the coming of a focused\r\nprocurement program. Washington should assure the Valley a market for\r\nthe right hardware. It should also try harder to help schools absorb it,\r\nso the machines wouldn’t just sit idle in closets.\r\n\r\nA national digital library, not just a digital store leading to\r\ncommercial collections, was just as essential as better hardware. Today\r\na college student researching the effect of Shakespeare on popular\r\nculture is able to find the Bard’s work at the school library. But what\r\nabout tracking down newer books that the library couldn’t afford to buy?\r\nAlso, only one student could read a paper copy at a time; suppose a\r\nprofessor wanted many students to compare impressions of a novel,\r\nespecially one that was out of print and long gone from the bookstores?\r\nPeople on the technical side could benefit even more than those in the\r\nhumanities. The best and most recent guides to Microsoft Word or\r\nWindows, for example, didn’t come from educators; rather they came from\r\nthe private sector. The faster this knowledge could reach average\r\ncitizens, the easier it would be to upgrade the labor force.\r\n\r\nA national digital library, moreover, would help many businesses market\r\ntheir goods. A food company trying to sell a new line of rice, for\r\nexample, could instantly call up cookbooks of many ethnic groups and\r\nfind out the relationship between food and the cultures. In an era of\r\ncustomized products, companies needed to learn quickly about niche\r\nmarkets. That would be especially true as business globalized; corporate\r\nplanners had to keep on top of conditions in many countries.\r\n\r\nSo TeleRead-style libraries—which let people look through many kinds of\r\ninformation, everything from books to UN reports—could make real\r\ncontributions in the United States and elsewhere. If nothing else,\r\ngovernments needed to understand the possible efficiencies. Yes, public\r\nand academic librarians would choose books. But innovative, private\r\nfirms would own the computer banks (well backed up) storing the books\r\nand other material; many different contractors, always trying to outdo\r\neach other’s technologies, could compete. Other efficiencies would\r\naccrue. Pooling the public libraries of rich and poor citizens would\r\nhelp everyone by increasing the variety of books available to all.\r\n\r\nBig Brother needn’t run a national digital library. Subject-oriented\r\nlibrarians in many cities might acquire material; in effect they would\r\nbe putting a public library system online, one that reflected the tastes\r\nof, say, Lyons as well as Paris. How much more supple than the\r\novercentralized approach that the French now favored for their national\r\nlibrary! The elite librarians could still identify the books _they_ had\r\nblessed, but the provincials could have their say as well; and, given\r\nthe variability of literary tastes over the ages, the latter in some\r\ncases might prevail anyway.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, by gambling money up front to qualify for royalties from\r\nTeleRead, writers and commercial publishers could bypass the librarians.\r\nBook people such as Laura Fillmore could thrive under this approach. A\r\nnational library could offer e-books not only to citizens directly but\r\nalso to independent-minded entrepreneurs such as Fillmore, who could\r\ncharge for their custom links. I loved the idealism she showed in\r\nsuggesting that ASCII be free. It was a good model in many cases for\r\ntoday. But I feared that as computers grew better for book reading—and\r\nit would happen eventually, with or without a TeleRead program—free\r\nASCII would take away too many paying customers. And if ASCII books\r\nweren’t free? Then, more than ever, piracy would occur regardless of\r\nvarious legal and technological precautions. So the answer should be\r\nfree national digital libraries—well stocked and with fair pay for\r\nwriters and publishers—to reduce the temptation to bypass copy\r\nprotection. Use tracking to report dialup counts and pay originators of\r\nmaterial, but not for billing. _That_ was the way to take full advantage\r\nof the technology and keep market incentives while promoting literacy.\r\n\r\nRich countries would be the first to start libraries of this kind. They\r\ncould safeguard their intellectual property by helping poorer countries\r\nget books online if the latter agreed to honor copyright laws. The time\r\nwould come for national and international Electronic Peace Corps to make\r\nthis possible. EPCs could help upgrade Third World phone systems on site\r\nand share knowledge via e-books, e-mail, two-way video, and otherwise.\r\nTo enforce global copyright law, we needed carrots as well as sticks.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, governments could protect books with technology far less\r\ncumbersome than the $25 gadgets that the pay-per-read bookstore in\r\nVirginia used. _Then_ e-text stood a chance. I thought of the old\r\nmerchant down South: Safes were useful, but only if the customers could\r\nenjoy an air-conditioner—an easy-to-use digital library for all of a\r\ncountry’s citizens.\r\n\r\nNational digital libraries, of course, could link up with each other and\r\nform an official world library someday. But, given the many cultural\r\ndifferences, that was impossible now. National libraries, then, were the\r\nway to go—with opportunities for citizens in different countries to read\r\neach other’s books when governments allowed this. I pitied the censors.\r\nIn an era of international computer networks, national libraries would\r\nend up anyway as one big global library for citizens of open societies\r\nand for the more resourceful people of countries such as Iran. Simply\r\nput, national digital libraries would make it so much easier to market\r\nor shop for books internationally. When a Swedish anarchist heard about\r\nTeleRead, his big question wasn’t, “Isn’t this an opportunity for\r\ncultural imperialism?” Instead it was, “Will I be able to read American\r\nbest-sellers as quickly as people there can?” Whatever the kind of\r\nbook—a Tom Clancy thriller or an anarchistic tract—TeleRead libraries\r\nwould allow easy global distribution.\r\n\r\nIn rich countries such as the United States and Sweden, the need for\r\nnational digital libraries would only grow with the introduction of\r\nbetter televisions and video games, not to mention the distractions of\r\nthe Net itself—including virtual reality, at some point. Even in wealthy\r\nnations, people had only so much disposable income. How much of it would\r\nbe left for online books? Mightn’t we use e-forms and digital libraries\r\nto transfer resources from paperwork to knowledge? As much as I\r\napplauded the good work that Frank Daniels was doing with the third\r\ngraders in Raleigh, I was a little put off by the online questionnaire\r\nfor adults and children using his BBS. It asked about favorite TV\r\nprograms, physical appearance, sports, and other activities, but a\r\nsimple question was missing—one that I felt certain would have been on\r\nthe list twenty years ago: “What are your favorite books?”\r\n\r\nSpring 1995: An (Interim) Afterword\r\n\r\nWhatever the medium—newspapers, books, or magazines—many Netfolks saw\r\nthe Internet as a path to diversity. That was partly why I liked seeing\r\n_The News & Observer_ online with A. C. Snow et al. Maybe the Internet\r\ncould rescue locally owned newspapers before they all tumbled down the\r\nmaws of conglomerates. On May 17, 1995, however, _The NandO Times_, the\r\nWebbed newspaper of the _N & O_, ran a story that I’d never wanted to\r\nread. A chain was buying up the company. For perhaps the first time, a\r\nNet daily reported on the sale of it and its pulped-wood siblings.\r\n\r\nA color photo showed Frank Daniels III briefing his staff. What really\r\ncaught my eye, however, was a revelation that I saw later in the _New\r\nYork Times_: “Frank Daniels III said he was convinced that the paper\r\nneeded to find a larger parent in part to give the paper the resources\r\nnecessary to nurture those new electronic efforts.” More than a few of\r\nus newspaper junkies had hoped that the new technology would help keep\r\nthe _N & O_ local. I recalled one reason why Daniels had not dumped his\r\n_N & O_ stock in the 1980s in favor of an investment in an online\r\nservice. “The relationship between a newspaper and a community,” he had\r\nsaid, “has such a richness and history that communities shouldn’t lose\r\nthat.” Now, however, after 101 years in the Daniels family, the _N & O_\r\nand trimmings were going to a California chain for $373 million. The\r\nbuyer was McClatchy Newspapers Inc., the former employer of George\r\nSchlukbier, the Daniels’s new-media guru.\r\n\r\nNo wicked corporate conspiracies existed here. The Danielses simply felt\r\ncomfortable with McClatchy, which not only shared the _N & O_’s still\r\nbasically liberal politics but also enjoyed a good reputation in the\r\nnewspaper business.\r\n\r\nRun out of Sacramento, McClatchy Newspapers was a family-owned chain\r\nwith just twelve dailies. It allowed much more leeway to local editors\r\nthan many others did, and I might well have reacted just as the Daniels\r\nfamily did when the McClatchy people came calling. The _N & O_ mustn’t\r\nend up in the hands of some skinflint chain; McClatchy Newspapers could\r\nbe an excellent alternative.\r\n\r\nStill, the sale did not delight me. The Net, after all, was supposed to\r\nbe good for small guys, including, presumably, family-owned enterprises.\r\nJosephus Daniels had bought the _N & O_ at that bankruptcy auction in\r\n1894, seen it through the Roaring Twenties, the stockmarket crash, and\r\nthe heyday of his friend FDR. He must have died thinking that the\r\nDaniels name would forever grace the masthead. From a portrait in the\r\nboardroom, he looked out at his progeny announcing the transaction. Just\r\nwhy couldn’t all the computers and cables and videocams have helped\r\nstrengthen the family business, not force its sale?\r\n\r\nI could see how the latter may have happened. The Daniels had had to\r\ninvest in both the printing press and the new med_ia_, with an emphasis\r\non the plural. A story on newsprint, an Internet audio, and a video\r\nwould cost more than just an old-fashioned version. Network-related\r\nexpenses of the _N & O_ may have been smaller than the investment in new\r\npress, but they would only grow in the future. No-frills Web areas cost\r\nnext to nothing to set up. But net.papers with the very flashiest\r\ngraphics and full-motion video would need programmers and designers and\r\nother specialists, not all of them cheap. At the same time the Daniels\r\nwanted to cover their circulation area well, and that meant a big,\r\nexpensive staff of reporters, too.\r\n\r\nJust as important, however, the _N & O_ faced strong competition for\r\nadvertisers and readers. Yes, the Net shrank distances and gave smaller\r\ncompanies some new marketing opportunities. But as shown by Time\r\nWarner’s giant electronic newsstand, it could also create some good\r\nsynergies for media conglomerates offering package deals to national\r\nadvertisers. In certain respects—hardly all—readers also benefited. I\r\ncould key in “Carly Simon,” for example, and see any stories that might\r\nhave appeared about her, not only in _Time_ but also in _Entertainment\r\nWeekly_ or _People_. Frank Daniels could bring together wire service\r\nnews and offbeat items from technical publications and others. But in\r\nthe future he couldn’t match the brand appeal of corporations such as\r\nTime Warner.\r\n\r\nDaniels had a right to be proud of his technological accomplishments, of\r\ncourse. But from now on, assuming that he stayed, as he apparently would\r\nfor the moment, he would be an employee rather than a member of the\r\nowning family. Forget the Third Wave talk of Net saving us all from\r\nconglomerates. We could all have our own home pages on the World Wide\r\nWeb, of course, and maybe put out little magazines; and IUMA-style\r\nstartups could always use the new technology to startle the Goliaths—and\r\nin the end, exceptions notwithstanding, the Internet did foster\r\ndiversity. Clearly, though, it was far from an all-purpose savior for\r\nthe _N & O_s of the world. However powerful in North Carolina, the\r\nRaleigh newspaper was hardly on an equal footing when it competed\r\nagainst the very largest media organizations.\r\n\r\nAs if to underscore that point, eight huge newspaper publishers had\r\nbanded together earlier that spring to form New Century Network, a club\r\nfor the big boys on the Net. Some people wondered if the giants might\r\nlose out in the end—readers wanted to tour the Web themselves, not just\r\nconfine themselves to material favored by newspaper coalitions. And\r\nmaybe New Century wouldn’t end up so exclusive after all. Also,\r\nadvertisers might prefer to sprinkle their cash around the Web rather\r\nthan focus it on newspaper chains—they could pay for links to their\r\npages from many sites without much ado. The natural economies of the Net\r\nmight yet win out over the business plans of the giants. Still, for the\r\nmoment, publishers such as Gannett and the Washington Post Company were\r\napparently setting the tone of New Century itself. The 185 New Century\r\npapers claimed more than 23 million paying readers.\r\n\r\n“New Century might raise antitrust questions,” wrote Rory O’Connor, a\r\nreporter for the _San Jose Mercury News_, part of Knight-Ridder, a chain\r\nin New Century. Peter Winter, interim chief executive of New Century,\r\nsaid the publishers were “comfortable with our conformance to antitrust\r\nstatutes.”[4.31]\r\n\r\nAntitrust was the talk of the newspaper and online industries. In early\r\nJune the U.S. Justice Department said it was studying the network that\r\nMicrosoft aimed to launch in August. Just by clicking on the proper icon\r\navailable through the Windows 95 operating system, people could join the\r\nMicrosoft Network. And some newspapers and other online services feared\r\nthat Microsoft could stifle the competition. In a year Windows might\r\nsell 20-40 million copies; what if several million users clicked?\r\n\r\nNewspapers worried increasingly about the Microsoft Network and other\r\nonline services. American Opinion Research of Princeton, N.J., found\r\nthat almost a fifth of the surveyed editors and publishers thought they\r\nmight lose more advertising to online services than to television.\r\nNearly three-quarters said the business was in good shape now. Just a\r\nhalf felt the same would be true by the year 2005.[4.32]\r\n\r\nThe newspaper chains tried to fight back. Large papers now owned 11\r\npercent of the shares in Netscape Communications, the wizards behind the\r\nfastest and best browser on the Web. For the moment things seemed fine\r\nfor the public. Netscape came up with new wrinkles that other companies\r\ndidn’t offer, such as the ability for Web pages to sprout color\r\nbackgrounds without much fuss. But so far it was working with\r\nstandards-setting bodies rather than saying, “Hey, you guys, these\r\nfeatures will be _mine_ alone.” I just hoped that in the future Netscape\r\nwouldn’t fashion its software to bind people to specific sources of news\r\nfrom conglomerates such as Knight-Ridder. Perhaps half the people\r\ncruising the Web were now using Netscape.\r\n\r\nIn a buying spree of its own, America Online purchased Internet fixtures\r\nsuch as WAIS Inc., the software company. WAIS had made some of the best\r\npublishing tools on the Net. America Online also bought the WebCrawler,\r\na first-rate index to the Web. The company acquired Global Net\r\nNavigator, too, the wonderfully Netcentric magazine from O’Reilly and\r\nAssociates, a guardian of Net culture. Just like Frank Daniels III, Tim\r\nO’Reilly alluded to the cost of online services. Explaining the sale, he\r\ntold a GNN mailing list that “in order to really do justice to the\r\ninformation problem GNN was created to solve, GNN would have to be\r\nscaled up beyond our ability to fund it on our own. With many large\r\nplayers entering the Internet information services market, the best way\r\nto keep our lead was to team up with one of them.”\r\n\r\nThe most dramatic—and, some critics might say, ominous—alliance may have\r\nhappened when MCI teamed up with Rupert Murdoch to form a new\r\npartnership that could offer many kinds of material on the Net. It\r\ncommitted as much as $2 billion toward his News Corporation.\r\n\r\nMCI wasn’t just eager to be a pipeline for publishers and others—it\r\nwanted to Originate Content. The phone company was already publishing\r\nreaders’ short stories electronically by way of Gramercy Press. Soon it\r\nwould release a trade paperback—yes, a book on pulped wood—from a\r\nnovelist writing under the name of a fictitious Gramercy author. But the\r\nMurdoch alliance meant so much more. This global entrepreneur controlled\r\nHarper-Collins through News Corps. Would his electronic books enjoy\r\nglobal distribution advantages via MCI’s pipelines, compared to\r\nofferings from smaller, less connected publishers?\r\n\r\nWithin the book business itself, the movement toward the Net was\r\naccelerating as summer 1995 neared. More and more authors were online,\r\ngetting feedback from fans—just as the fledgling rockers of IUMA did. It\r\nwas a great morale booster, but only to a point. The novelist Nicholson\r\nBaker, author of the _New Yorker_ article on electronic library\r\ncatalogues, complained that e-mail had “the problem of promptitude. You\r\nhave to answer within four days or you’re being rude. I like the\r\nstateliness of paper, where you can take six months. You’re still being\r\nunforgivably rude, but somehow it’s okay because other people have been\r\nrude in this way before.”[4.33] Obscure writers, however, found the fan\r\nmail from the Internet to be more helpful. In that way the Net was a\r\n_friend_ of diversity.\r\n\r\nSmaller publishers were also growing more comfortable with the Internet.\r\nBookport, a California-based service, let them post their books on the\r\nWorld Wide Web for Netfolks to read page by page. Alas, a customer could\r\nnot obtain a whole e-book at once. The idea, of course, was to\r\ndiscourage piracy. I disliked the idea of pay-per-read prevailing; the\r\nlibrary model would make books much more popular among the young and\r\nactually _help_ good publishers. But the Bookport was well done with\r\noodles of great links to book-related sites on the Web. One of the first\r\ntitles was _Netiquette_, a guide to manners on the Internet; that was in\r\nthe community-minded spirit of the traditional Net.\r\n\r\nLarger publishers, too, pushed ahead on the Web. Time Warner was selling\r\n“Quick Reads.” It was a series of reference books, self-help guides, and\r\nothers that you could download in full and search for, say, the right\r\nquote from a famous business executive (_Bartlett’s Book of Business\r\nQuotations_) or the appropriate recipe (the _Cooking Library_). I could\r\nunderstand Time Warner’s fondness here for reference books. Most readers\r\ndidn’t want to gawk at electronic novels hour after hour. The big\r\nquestion, in cases of tech-savvy conglomerates like Time Warner, was not\r\nwhether the publishers were ready. It was whether the _public_ was;\r\nwhether enough people would end up soon enough with the proper hardware\r\nfor reading books in bed or on the sofa.\r\n\r\nThat, of course, was where TeleRead came in. Whatever their sizes,\r\npublishers needed to hook the nonelite in this videocentric era before\r\nthey gave up on the written word.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe above is not to suggest that text is the only way to communicate\r\nknowledge over the Net. The right graphics certainly can as well. One of\r\nthe most intriguing examples of the potential here is a remarkable\r\nendeavor—the Visible Human Project—in which, so to speak, a murder lives\r\non forever in cyberspace to the benefit of medical education and cancer\r\nresearch. I’ll discuss this in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER\r\n                                  FIVE\r\n\r\n    Wired Knowledge:\r\n    When They Let a\r\n    Murderer Loose\r\n    on the Internet\r\n\r\n\r\nPaul Jernigan was a tattooed ex-mechanic just under six feet tall and\r\nweighing 200 pounds. He had been a drug addict and a chronic drunk, but\r\nnearly all his organs still looked in textbook shape by the standards of\r\ngross anatomy—a stroke of luck that would later help him win him a\r\nmacabre competition. Jernigan had fatally stabbed and shot a\r\nseventy-five-year-old watchman after stealing a radio and a microwave\r\noven. More than a decade had passed. So had his hopes for a successful\r\nappeal to the courts.\r\n\r\nLying on a gurney in a Texas deathhouse—his arms outstretched, as if in\r\na crucifixion—Paul Jernigan just gawked upward as his brother watched.\r\nNo last words came before the poison flowed into Jernigan’s veins.\r\n\r\nJernigan gave himself to science. A not-so-loquacious sister told me\r\nthis was to spare the family the cost of burial. “It was like, matter of\r\nfact,” his last attorney said of the donation. “It was a gift. He wasn’t\r\ngoing to laud himself, pat himself on the back. We didn’t send an\r\nembossed announcement that ‘Paul Jernigan has donated his body to\r\nscience and this is his ticket to redemption.’”[5.1] A former cellmate\r\noffered his own twist. Supposedly, Jernigan wanted his family to be able\r\nto sell his life story for a true-crime book. The donation just might\r\nmake the planet care more about him in death than in life.\r\n\r\nWithin a year of the execution, in fact, I was reading clips about Paul\r\nJernigan from the _London Times_, _Jerusalem Post_, _New York Times_,\r\n_Washington Post_, _Los Angeles Times_, and the _Boston Globe_. My\r\nfavorite lead came out in a British paper called _The Independent_: “A\r\nkiller was yesterday let loose on the Internet computer network.” I\r\nwondered how he’d respond to flaming. The new Jernigan lived on as a\r\ndigital atlas of the human body, a few steaklike cross sections of which\r\nI could dial up on the World Wide Web.\r\n\r\nThe Visible Human Project had come out of the National Library of\r\nMedicine in a Maryland suburb near Washington, D.C. It was one of the\r\nmost spectacular examples of the Net’s potential for spreading\r\nknowledge, the topic of this chapter.\r\n\r\nResearchers had cut Jernigan into four blocks, frozen him in a blue gel,\r\nground him down millimeter by millimeter, digitally photographed the\r\n1,878 cross sections that emerged, scanned these slices[5.2] into a\r\ncomputer, put them on magnetic tape, and then on the Internet. Now the\r\ncadaver would be grist for medical educators and cancer researchers and\r\nperhaps even the designers of a “Fantastic Voyage”-style game. Players\r\nmight explore the human body from the inside, just as Isaac Asimov’s\r\ncharacters did in his novel. The government itself was spending $1.4\r\nmillion on the project; expected commercial payoffs could reach the tens\r\nof millions and maybe more. Research and education, however, would be\r\nparamount here.\r\n\r\nThe Visible Human Project is but one of thousands of uses that academics\r\nand researchers have found for the Internet. The Net is why many\r\nscientific luminaries were quick to slap the “fraud” label on efforts to\r\ncreate energy through cold fusion. Skeptics throughout the world could\r\ncompare notes. If Paris couldn’t replicate an experiment, then Boston\r\nwould know within hours. Working in the other direction, fusion\r\nstalwarts have used the Internet to swap data and maintain the faith.\r\nCyberspace is to knowledge what beehives are to honey.\r\n\r\nAlready the Net teems with thousands of mailing lists devoted to the\r\nmost arcane disciplines, not just to the mainstream ones. Many\r\nscientists and other researchers envision the Net as a substitute for\r\npaper-style academic journals, subscriptions to some of which can cost\r\nas much as a Ford Escort. Stevan Harnad has caught the imaginations of\r\nmany academics with “A Subversive Proposal” for scholars to publish\r\ntheir finished works formally on the Net without offering them to\r\nacademic publishers. He puts out a vigilantly edited, psychology-related\r\nmagazine with a circulation of tens of thousand on the Internet; he sees\r\nno reason for the Net just to be a repository for pre-publication\r\npapers. In his opinion, academics could use such opportunities to enjoy\r\ngreater bargaining power with existing publishers.\r\n\r\nYet another glory of the Internet is that it serves as a bridge between\r\nexperts and nonexperts, as well as one between authorities in many\r\nacademic disciplines. A dean of a law school, for example, can sign up\r\nfor mailing lists on electronic serials to learn more about the\r\ntechnology that is fueling the drive for copyright reform.\r\n\r\nFrom Day One, the Internet was a creature of the elite research\r\nestablishment, but knowledge-related uses have steadily grown more\r\negalitarian—starting with the brightest students in elementary and high\r\nschools, then moving on to average children, and even to problem kids.\r\n\r\nTo dispose of a major issue, No, the Net shouldn’t replace teachers. I\r\ncouldn’t agree more with Cliff Stoll when he rants against lax standards\r\nand mindless technocratic schemes. Well-trained teachers can provide\r\ninspiration and guidance to help children explore networks on their own.\r\nThe last thing we need is to turn the educational reaches of the Net\r\ninto one big flash card. What the Net can do is prepare children to deal\r\nwith source material, with actual papers written by researchers, as\r\nopposed to pabulum in textbooks.\r\n\r\nCorrectly, Stoll criticizes some educators for teaching astronomy\r\nwithout children studying the actual sky; computer programs should only\r\nsupplement such activities, not replace them. But shouldn’t he apply the\r\nsame “real thing” logic to Web-distributed source material and applaud\r\nstudents’ easier access to it? Only the brightest children will benefit\r\nfrom a complicated mathematical treatise. But surely even an average\r\nstudent could take advantage of a historian’s paper on a nearby Civil\r\nWar battle. If anything, teachers could use the Web and other areas of\r\nthe Net to demand _more_ research from students. Just why must Stoll\r\ncompare the Net to a fun but dumb educational film? Is a Web version of\r\nthe _Odyssey_ to be confused with some educational Looney Tunes?\r\n\r\nIntriguingly, Web technology makes it possible for students to produce\r\ninformation, not just soak it up. In Fairfax County, Virginia, students\r\nat Thomas Jefferson, a high school for the gifted, are posting their\r\n“pages” on the World Wide Web. I can remember when college applicants\r\nsubmitted tape recordings of their music. Now they can also give M.I.T.\r\nor Caltech the addresses of their Web pages and demonstrate, in the most\r\ndirect way, their familiarity with networking. They can post their\r\npapers and point to other people’s pages that interest them.\r\n\r\nAlso, at Jefferson and countless other schools, students can\r\nelectronically send their classmates to knowledge-rich sites on the Web.\r\nClicking on “NASA” in blue letters within Bob’s area, Jill can see what\r\nthe space program is doing. Then she can return, click on other blue\r\nletters, and check out his tip to visit a history-related site\r\ndiscussing the Sputnik and Vanguard days. Via a project called\r\nMendelWeb, Ellen can read the famous treatise of Gregor Mendel, the\r\ngeneticist, and retrieve other scientists’ opinions; then she might\r\nwrite her own paper and post it on the Web for classmates and even for\r\nstudents elsewhere.\r\n\r\nClearly the value of the Net, for students and researchers alike, isn’t\r\njust in the information per se—it’s also in the ease of sharing it.\r\nTeachers can point to common Web resources (such as MendelWeb) from Web\r\npages where they add their own comment, or even their own study guides.\r\nThey can also link to other guides.\r\n\r\nSome Web sites even offer electronic forms with questions to which\r\nstudents can respond—in either a multiple choice or an essay format.\r\nAndy Carvin, a specialist in educational technology with the Corporation\r\nfor Public Broadcasting, praises the World Wide Web as “an excellent\r\ntool in which to design online curricula.” Understandably, even\r\nelementary schools are getting on the Web with their own areas.\r\n\r\nOther good things are happening. By way of a project called Big Sky\r\nTelegraph, Native Americans in Montana have been pen pals with children\r\nin the former Soviet Union. What better way to stir up an interest in\r\nwriting, politics, and geography at the same time? Significantly, in\r\nMontana and other places, many schools are not on the Net directly.\r\nInstead, schools use affordable bulletin board systems—their own or\r\nperhaps those operated by hobbyists—which can relay Net-originated\r\nmaterial. If need be, such systems can run on ancient computers of the\r\nkind found at garage sales; some messages may be delayed for days, but\r\nthat’s better than no connection at all. Within the BBS world, moreover,\r\nnets even exist especially for education. Consider K12Net, which\r\nincludes at least “three dozen conferences specifically related to K-12\r\ncurriculum” and reaches some sixty school-associated systems in New\r\nZealand alone. More and more, however, lucky schools are hooking into\r\nthe Internet directly or at least arranging for teachers and students to\r\nget accounts elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAs a ninth grader at Poolesville Middle Senior High School, in\r\nPoolesville, Maryland, Chris Gazunis used the Net to study catastrophes\r\nsuch as earthquakes, hurricanes, and oil spills. “We didn’t just look at\r\na textbook diagram of what caused an earthquake and the casualty number\r\nassociated with it,” he recalled. “We used the networks to learn what\r\nhappened to the people’s lives and homes. Instead of just being given a\r\nset of directions and material that would result in an earthquake\r\nresistant building, we designed and tested them ourselves.”[5.3]\r\n\r\nRandy Hammer, a high schooler at Timberline High School in Lacey,\r\nWashington, who is blind “with two glass eyes,” once had to have sighted\r\npeople read the newspaper to him. No longer. Via network connections, he\r\ncan enjoy the _Washington Post_, the _Moscow News_, and science-oriented\r\npublications—thanks to a gadget that reads aloud to him the words on his\r\nscreen. “It’s hard now,” he wrote, “to remember how I lived without this\r\nwealth of materials and information at my fingertips.”[5.4] That’s what\r\nhappens when the hardware is around.\r\n\r\nEven in a wealthy place like the United States, however, society so far\r\nhas been stingy toward high tech in public schools. The ratio between\r\nstudents and computers is something like 16 to 1. Some 75 percent of\r\nAmerican schools have computers capable of getting on the Net, but the\r\nchildren can’t all use them at once. What’s more, just 35 percent of\r\npublic schools have Internet hookups in classrooms, media centers, or\r\ncomputer labs. Only 3 percent of the classrooms themselves are wired in,\r\naccording to a survey from the U.S. Department of Education.\r\n\r\nWe’re talking almost Third World here. “It’s amazing to me how people\r\noutside of education have no idea how teachers still have to line up\r\noutside the teachers’ lounge to use the telephone,” says a senior\r\nanalyst at the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment.[5.5]\r\n\r\nIn the end, as I see it, the real solution is a TeleRead-style program\r\nof the kind described in the previous chapter. It would connect the\r\nstudents to the nets from home, reduce the future communications costs\r\nof the schools somewhat, and allow students to explore computer networks\r\nat leisure rather than just during the school day. A few small steps are\r\nalready being taken in this general direction. The state of Maryland has\r\ngranted limited—but free—Internet privileges to school children and\r\nother residents. Without leaving home, they can dial up material ranging\r\nfrom weather reports, to academic papers, to Shakespearean poetry.\r\nJoseph Peightel, a cable splicer with Bell Atlantic, says that the\r\nSailor program is just the ticket for his ten-year-old daughter, whose\r\nhunger for books outstrips the family budget. While the Peightels can’t\r\nretrieve the latest best-sellers, they at least can enjoy Project\r\nGutenberg-style material in the public domain. The Maryland program\r\nhelping the Peightels is not TeleRead, and it comes with problems and\r\ninefficiencies, but it may be as close as any state effort to the\r\nnirvana envisioned by Al Gore, in which all children could dial up the\r\nLibrary of Congress.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I bristle when Cliff Stoll glosses over the reasons why\r\nthe Net can’t provide easy answers to questions such as “What political\r\ncompromises caused Bismarck to become the capital of North Dakota?” or\r\n“Why isn’t Kyoto the capital of today’s Japan?” or “What’s the history\r\nof the Ruhr Valley, and what are the implications of its new Eastern\r\nEuropean competition?” Of course. Worried about piracy, publishers have\r\nunderstandably kept their textbooks off the Net. The last laugh,\r\nhowever, just may be on the more zealous of the copyright interests.\r\nRight now Stoll couldn’t be more correct about the need for more and\r\nbetter books on the Net; but as shown by, say, MendelWeb, the academic\r\ncommunity is doing plenty on its own. And if this keeps up, the demand\r\nfor copyrighted, commercial books, the kind that feed me, my editors,\r\nand yes, my publishers, too, could suffer. Far better to have a national\r\ndigital library with privately originated books available from the very\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nAhead I’ll examine more closely some scientific and educational uses of\r\nthe Net. Selections—yes, the print kind, not the Jernigan variety—will\r\nappear on:\r\n\r\n• The “hows,” the positives, and the negatives of the Visible Human\r\n  Project—it stands out for reasons beyond the drama. The Clinton\r\n  administration has encouraged high-bandwidth, scientific users of the\r\n  Net. The original Visible Man requires sixteen gigabytes of\r\n  storage—enough space to hold fifty _Encyclopaedia Britannica_s. Some\r\n  say this isn’t the best use of Net resources. I disagree, however, and\r\n  I’ll tell why. Along the way I’ll pass on information about the\r\n  Internet’s Visible Man before he became so visible.\r\n\r\n• High school use of the Internet. The United States is hardly the only\r\n  nation with thousands of children in cyberspace—countries ranging from\r\n  Canada to Singapore are putting students online, directly or\r\n  indirectly. Significantly, computers and networks can help students\r\n  outside the elite. Some proof of this comes from Nova Scotia, where,\r\n  for several years, a high school has been using the Internet to\r\n  benefit some “at-risk” students. I’ll tell you about the Internet\r\n  success that a Canadian teacher named Jeff Doran has enjoyed with\r\n  leather-jacketed teenagers. Many are racing into the computer lab and,\r\n  let’s hope, away from fates such as Paul Jernigan’s. The Internet\r\n  project at Park View Education Centre is far from an unqualified\r\n  triumph—many Park View teachers still fear the technology—but patterns\r\n  there suggest a vast potential for educational uses of the Net if\r\n  schools will modernize their curricula.\r\n\r\nThe Visible Man\r\n\r\nThe doctor, a Scottish-accented man in his fifties or sixties, had\r\ncollected a wall full of diplomas and plaques. Perhaps that’s why he\r\nfelt entitled to give only the sketchiest of explanations when he told a\r\nMidwestern friend of mine that she might need heart surgery to avoid a\r\npossible stroke. Karen* would be in the hospital just a day or so. But\r\nduring this time a surgeon would insert a catheter up her groin and go\r\non to kill off selected heart cells. With luck, the operation would end\r\nher atrial fibrillation. It had made her heart throb as quickly as 200\r\nbeats a minute on occasion and had sent her to the emergency room.\r\n\r\nKaren pressed for details about the recommended operation. “Ma’am,” Dr.\r\nS. said in a peremptory burr, “this is too technical.”\r\n\r\nIt was Valentine’s Day and Karen and her husband would rather have been\r\nthinking about hearts in that way alone. But she wanted to know all.\r\n“Ma’am, I’ll draw you a picture,” Dr. S. said a bit grudgingly. The\r\ndoctor sketched a crude heart that might as well have been on a greeting\r\ncard. Hastily drawn lines showed how electric impulses were traveling\r\nthrough Karen’s heart with an extra path. The operation would cut off\r\nthe surplus wiring, so to speak.\r\n\r\nWell, this was a start. But Karen still felt ignorant, and it was _her_\r\nbody into which the catheter would go. And so it is with many patients,\r\nnot all, but many. Even good doctors don’t always tell enough.\r\n\r\nThe Visible Human Project, however, would make it easier for Karen to\r\nlearn more. Dr. S. could have shown Karen a computer image of an actual\r\nhuman heart and have pointed to the exact areas that the surgeon would\r\nkill off. Karen would have picked up a better appreciation of the\r\ncomplexities of the proposed operation. At the same time, Dr. S. could\r\nalso have juggled around computer images to show the increased risk of\r\nclotting that would result if she _failed_ to have the operation. Karen\r\nwould have emerged better informed and more confident—or less, whatever\r\nthe facts justified. Someday she might even be able to dial up on the\r\nInternet an animated, perfectly detailed series of pictures of the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nThat was what the Visible Human Project would mean. What’s more, patient\r\neducation was just one of many uses; the right technology could\r\nrevolutionize the training of doctors and advance medical research.\r\n\r\nAs far back as the 1980s, such ideas intrigued Michael Ackerman, a Ph.D.\r\nin biomedical engineering who worked for the National Library of\r\nMedicine, part of the National Institutes of Health. He heard of a\r\nproject at the University of Washington that was digitizing the human\r\nbrain, although not the entire body. Researchers at other schools hoped\r\nto do the same with other organs. But they were less keen on collecting\r\nimages and other data than on using them, so why duplicate each other?\r\nLike the Internet itself, then, just one digitized corpse could help\r\nmany researchers at once.\r\n\r\nIn North Carolina a marketing executive with a drug company was dreaming\r\nof a human atlas on a computer screen. Why should medical students have\r\nto make do with fold-out drawings in anatomy guides? Michael Du Toit,\r\nVice President of marketing for Glaxo Inc., passed the idea on to a\r\nsmall company called Butler Communications, which checked out the\r\ntechnology. Glaxo had three goals. First, it wanted to create the basic\r\nimages. Second, it wanted viewers to be able to wander through the body;\r\nideally they could move the body for the best view, spin it, travel\r\nthrough it. And third, it wanted researchers to be able to give the\r\nlungs cancer, clog the arteries to the heart, and demonstrate the\r\neffects of drugs. But computers weren’t ready. “The hype versus the\r\ndeliverable,” Robert Butler told me, “was miles and miles apart.” To\r\nmeet Glaxo’s specs—to show the body by way of artistic recreations and\r\nvirtual reality—might cost as much as $100 million.\r\n\r\nImagine the excitement that Du Toit and Butler must have felt on\r\nlearning that academic and government researchers were finally coming up\r\nwith the means for this to happen at a fraction of the expense. The Feds\r\nput out a request for proposals for the dissection job, and the crew at\r\nthe University of Colorado made the final cut. Still unanswered was the\r\nquestion of whose corpse would end up on the Internet. The contest\r\njudges allowed a bit more leeway than did the people choosing Miss\r\nAmerica and Mr. Universe.\r\n\r\nThe ideal candidate for Visibility could be anywhere from maybe thirty\r\nto sixty years of age and be a bit thin or pudgy, albeit not exceedingly\r\nso. Height mustn’t go too far beyond the norms for male and female.\r\nAbove all, the innards of the body had to be photogenic from an\r\nanatomical perspective. That weeded out anyone worn down by cancer or\r\nsimilar disease, not to mention any victims of automobile accidents or\r\nknifings.\r\n\r\nA little unfairly, this contest had geographical limits. Texas,\r\nMaryland, and Colorado were the states with subcontracts to provide the\r\nbody. I could understand Maryland and Colorado, but Texas? I wondered if\r\nthe reason would be the fondness of the people down there for capital\r\npunishment. No longer did bodies have to roast in electric chairs. Texas\r\nhelpfully killed its murderers with lethal injections. So, in this\r\ncompetition, Paul Jernigan was a strong contender from the beginning.\r\n\r\nMurder is an act of the will no matter how poor or Hitlerian our parents\r\nare, or what genes shape us and our brains. But if Fate sent anyone to\r\nthe deathhouse gurney and to Visible Manhood, it was Paul Jernigan. He\r\nlived out an updated Dreiser novel.\r\n\r\nHis full legal name was Joseph Paul Jernigan, and he was born in Geneva,\r\nIllinois, on January 31, 1954, the youngest of Earl Jernigan’s six\r\nchildren. The boy suffered from asthma and almost died of it. He and his\r\nbrothers and sisters typically owned just one pair of jeans each. Their\r\nmother eked it out in a chicken-processing plant, as a clerk at\r\nMontgomery Wards, and at other low-paying jobs, and they lived in public\r\nhousing. She married a truck driver who, like Earl, was a strict\r\ndisciplinarian toward the children. Later she suffered a stroke.\r\nAfflicted with a learning disorder, Paul flunked a grade at school and\r\ndropped out two years before graduating. He was a drunk and eventually\r\nwas doing a pharmacy’s worth of drugs, from Quaaludes to horse\r\ntranquilizers.\r\n\r\nThe Army trained Paul Jernigan as a mechanic, sent him to Germany, then\r\ntossed him out as unsalvageable. Perhaps recognizing the cruel matrix\r\nthat shaped Jernigan, it gave him a general discharge (a “no comment” in\r\neffect) rather than a dishonorable one. A shrink later found Jernigan to\r\nbe a passive-aggressive man who was sometimes TNT-volatile. In the years\r\nafter the military Jernigan kept a cooler of ice and beer in his\r\nautomobile; a typical paycheck went for pot, cheeseburgers, and enough\r\noctane for himself and the car.\r\n\r\nParadoxically, though, friends trusted Paul Jernigan with their\r\nchildren. Jernigan was the perfect baby-sitter who enjoyed romping\r\naround with his charges. He married for a stretch and loved his\r\nstepchildren.\r\n\r\nBut he failed at marriage just as he had failed in school and in the\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\nJernigan bungled at burglary, too. He was already a two-time loser in\r\n1981 when he and a pal named Roy Lamb were driving down the road in\r\nCorsicana, Texas, a small, howdy-neighbor kind of town south of Dallas\r\non Interstate 45. Emboldened by a night of booze and pot, the two\r\ndecided to rob Edward Hale’s house. They began stuffing their loot into\r\na pillow case when Hale surprised them. Lamb ran out. Jernigan beat Hale\r\nover the head with an ashtray, hoping to kill off the witness. Hale\r\nstubbornly survived. Then Jernigan stabbed him with a rusty, dull-bladed\r\nmeat knife, which just bent on Hale’s chest. And so he took a shotgun\r\nand fired until the watchman was dead. Edward Hale did not die\r\npainlessly.\r\n\r\nAfter the murder, Jernigan went to Houston to try to straighten out his\r\nlife. He was in a halfway house when arrested.\r\n\r\nSome would say Jernigan needn’t have wound up on the gurney; the law\r\nprevented the courts from accepting an accomplice’s testimony. Mark\r\nTicer, his last attorney, believes that Jernigan may have felt so\r\ncontrite that he wanted to die. Ticer grew truly fond of his client. In\r\ncharacter, Jernigan would constantly inquire about the lawyer’s\r\ntwo-year-old and remember birthdays.\r\n\r\nJernigan gave Ticer’s wife, Cecily, some earrings made from gold bought\r\nwith his military pension, and he crafted a wishing-well bucket for\r\nTicer. Ticer was as trusting of the murderer as Jernigan’s friends had\r\nbeen; he would have trusted him with his own young daughter. Even on\r\ndeath row Jernigan would write to the stepchildren from his failed\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nSmoking a hand-rolled cigarette and sipping a Pepsi, he would discuss\r\nlegal strategy with Ticer until finally there wasn’t quite so much to be\r\nstrategic about.\r\n\r\n“Paul,” Ticer more or less said, “things are not going well. I guess I\r\nhave to talk about your burial arrangements if they’re going to execute\r\nyou. I know your family doesn’t have a lot of money.” And it was there\r\nin the Ellis prison in Huntsville that Ticer learned of The Gift.\r\nNeither knew Jernigan would eventually become the Visible Man.\r\n\r\nMark Ticer tried for a stay of execution up to the last minute. Aware of\r\nTicer’s devotion to him, Jernigan asked his lawyer not to witness his\r\nlast minutes. Death was almost instant. Paul Jernigan died much more\r\nsmoothly than he had lived.\r\n\r\nThe state anatomical board, a subcontractor of the University of\r\nColorado, took it from there. Jernigan got one and a half gallons of 1\r\npercent formalin. That was a light touch. Often cadavers are embalmed\r\nwith ten gallons of a stronger preservative, and they sit and pickle for\r\na year, so that when medical students cut them up all the tissues are\r\ngray. But the idea here, in case Jernigan won the Visible Man honors,\r\nwas to keep his tissue looking nice and bright like prime meat; the\r\nstudents would be able to enjoy a better, more realistic view.\r\n\r\nWriting this chapter, I pondered the use of the state anatomical board\r\nas a cadaver procurer. Thank God the board was separate from the court\r\nsystem. Given the rage for businesslike government, I could just imagine\r\nsome of the wilder politicians setting up an execution quota to work\r\ntoward a balanced state budget. But the real reason for the use of\r\nJernigan’s corpse was more prosaic. Texas had one of the best\r\ncadaver-donation programs in the country, and of some 2,000 bodies that\r\nyear, his just happened to show up at the right time and in the right\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nA Learjet flew Jernigan from Texas to Colorado. Awaiting him were the\r\nmasterminds of the dissection effort at the University of Colorado\r\nHealth Sciences Center in Denver. Victor Spitzer specialized in\r\nradiology and cellular and structural biology; David Whitlock was a\r\nprofessor of cellular and structural biology. The people working most on\r\nJernigan would be the research assistants in the dissection room, which,\r\nday to day, was overseen by Tim Butzer, thirty, and his wife, Martha\r\nPelster, a bright, curly-haired woman of twenty-five who would later\r\napply for medical school. Helen Pelster, another assistant, was the\r\nsister of Martha Pelster.[5.6] The whole scenario—the family\r\nconnection—begged for embellishment from Stephen King or Robin Cook.\r\n\r\nI asked Martha Pelster if her work haunted her at night. “I kind of keep\r\nit on a pretty even level,” she said. “I don’t have too much trouble\r\nwith it.”[5.7] She said Butzer felt the same.\r\n\r\nHad Jernigan inspired much after-hours talk with her husband?\r\n\r\n“If there was a problem that needed to be worked out.”\r\n\r\nBut did Pelster and Butzer reflect on the Visible Man’s past in relation\r\nto what was happening now?\r\n\r\n“Not too much. Getting emotionally involved with something like that—you\r\ndon’t want to discuss it. It isn’t relevant to what we’re doing.”\r\n\r\nInquiring about the university’s most famous cadaver, I learned that\r\nJernigan had come with at least two tattoos on his chest area; they\r\nlooked vaguely like dragons. His build and muscles were impressive. The\r\nlab had to modify some of the machinery to handle Jernigan. He showed up\r\nwith just one testicle, which, I learned elsewhere, was the aftermath of\r\npainful surgery from his military days. I also heard that another\r\noperation had left him without an appendix. Students and researchers\r\nseeking to unravel the mysteries of appendixdom would just have to turn\r\nelsewhere. As a taxpayer, however, I didn’t feel cheated. This was the\r\nStates, not Bangladesh; did that many Americans die without any remnants\r\nof surgery? Jernigan’s cadaver stood head and shoulders above a rival, a\r\nwoman who was a chronic alcoholic with visible damage to her liver. In\r\nthe hierarchy of the dissection room livers must have counted more than\r\nappendixes.\r\n\r\nBefore the millimeter-by-millimeter grinding, the scientists treated\r\nJernigan to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, mixing radio waves and\r\nmagnetic fields) and computer-aided tomography (CAT or CT, which is like\r\ntopography except that it’s on the innards of the human body). MRI picks\r\nup soft tissue. CAT scans are good for hard tissue, and for the\r\ndifferences between it and soft tissue. The researchers CT’ed Jernigan\r\nboth before and after he was frozen, and these scans had to correspond\r\nwith the alignment of the digitized photographs. Imagine the precision\r\nrequired here.\r\n\r\nPreparing to slice the icy cadaver into four blocks for convenient\r\ngrinding, the lab crew sharpened up on a less exalted cadaver. Vertebrae\r\nwere a problem. “This saw would curve,” Pelster said, “so you wouldn’t\r\nhave a perfect perpendicular flat cut. It would have a curve to it. So\r\nwe took the cadaver back to the CT scanner and found the level where we\r\ncould make a cut.” In the end there were three cuts and four sections of\r\nJernigan—head and torso, abdomen and pelvis just down to the thighs, the\r\nrest of the thighs and the knees, and just below the knees to the feet.\r\nThe frozen pieces went into an aluminum mold, one at a time. And then\r\nthe researchers poured a blue gel around them (the same blue you’ll see\r\non the edges of the cross sections if you dial them up on the World Wide\r\nWeb). The result was four chunks of ice, each approximately 20 by 20 by\r\n15 inches.\r\n\r\nThe grinding area was the next stop. Plexiglass enclosed it. That was a\r\nmust. Pieces of cadaver would fly everywhere as science turned Paul\r\nJernigan into dust with a spinning, carbide-tipped blade. “You’d think\r\nwe’d have trouble sectioning bone,” Pelster said, “but that’s not been\r\nthe case. Bone always cuts very clean. But sometimes we have a lot of\r\ntrouble with the tendons. The tendons are such that they don’t want to\r\nshear off cleanly, and so a lot of time we did hand scalpel work on each\r\nslice. So the slices might take ten minutes each instead of four minutes\r\neach.” Actually the time varied. “Ninety slices were the most we cut on\r\nany one day, and we averaged sixty. Sometimes it was ten a day. It was\r\nabout four months of sectioning.”\r\n\r\n“Were you worried about damaging the goods?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Definitely. We just did the best we could.”\r\n\r\n“Any near misses?”\r\n\r\n“There were definitely a few. We never were to the point where we\r\ntorpedoed the whole project. It would be more a possibility of losing a\r\nslice. We never came close to botching the whole thing. You look back\r\nand you see a little dot of ice here or there, things like that. You do\r\nthe best you can. But I think it turned out well.”\r\n\r\nAll along, of course, cameras and lights were clicking and flashing\r\naway. The slices went into a black-walled, reflection-proof chamber for\r\nphotographing by one digital camera and two with film. A table held the\r\ncameras. It turned to give each a view of the cross sections from the\r\nsame angle. The results went into a Macintosh Quadra 840AV with 128\r\nmegabytes of random access memory and 2 gigabytes of hard disk space. It\r\nwas, in other words, many times more powerful and could store at least\r\nseveral times more than the average personal computer. As with the\r\ngrinding, problems sometimes arose. “You think computers are so\r\nprecise,” Martha Pelster said, “but they’re not. Things are always going\r\nwrong.” Typically working with her and Tim were such people as the man\r\nwho kept the grinding machine running, a camera expert, and a computer\r\nexpert (Helen Pelster, Martha’s sister), who would transfer the\r\ndigitized Jernigan to tape and CD-ROM. Come the end of a hard day of\r\nphotography, the lab crew collected everything and put it back in the\r\nfreezer. “And then when we were finished doing this,” Pelster said, “we\r\nhad many bags of things that needed to go be cremated.” The dust went to\r\na contractor for incineration.\r\n\r\nDigitized photos and CAT and MRI images from Jernigan went to National\r\nLibrary of Medicine in Maryland and to the Scientific Computing Division\r\nat the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.\r\nThe latter worked with a Cray Y-MP/8 supercomputer and Silicon Graphics\r\nworkstations to study the results. A headline on the World Wide Web\r\nsummed up the magnitude of the computational task: “The Visible Human\r\nProject: Can It Bring a Supercomputer to Its Knees?” A machine with the\r\npower of the Cray could take the 1,878 cross sections, stack them like\r\nslices of an upright bread loaf, and create electronic bones or hearts\r\nor brains that looked as if they had never been taken apart in the first\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nBy fall 1994, Michael Ackerman at the National Library of Medicine was\r\nready to tell the world about the electronic Jernigan and to have his\r\nimages posted on the Net by way of the weather forecaster’s facilities.\r\n“We hold this out as an example of the future of health care,” Ackerman\r\nsaid. He predicted that the study of medicine would become increasingly\r\nvisual. No one talked then of a murderer, and so the first stories on\r\nthe wire services blandly mentioned an anonymous thirty-nine-year-old\r\ndonor from Texas who had died of a drug overdose.\r\n\r\nLearning that a digitized corpse would go on the Internet, not everyone\r\ngreeted the news with unalloyed praise. Some reviled this as a waste of\r\nNet resources. Why not use CD-ROMs to distribute the information? To an\r\nextent I could see their arguments. The Library was releasing sixteen\r\ngigabytes of images at the start, and even someone with a deluxe Net\r\nconnection could spend a week or so downloading it. Critics believed\r\nthat this squandered bandwidth, that it was a bit like cruising down a\r\nnarrow country road with an overgrown tour bus and fifty cars honking at\r\nit from behind. The strain on the Internet was far from that bad. But\r\neven by Net standards this was indeed a behemoth, and much more\r\nimportantly, the bandwidth defenders worried about the precedent being\r\nset here. Sixteen gigabytes of images was equivalent to 8 billion pages\r\nof double-spaced typing. Individual e-mail messages commonly took up\r\nonly a page or two.\r\n\r\nEven so, the Visible Man had his friends out there in cyberspace.\r\nAnxious to beat rivals to the data, one company kept its modems pumping\r\naway for a week until it had received all of Jernigan. It didn’t want to\r\nwait weeks or months for tapes. Thanks to the Net, many people\r\nthroughout the world could receive Jernigan at the same time. In the\r\nfirst few months of the release, more than 900 companies, schools, and\r\npeople wrote Ackerman about licenses giving them permission to use the\r\ndata in experiments and products. Some 100 actually followed\r\nthrough—everyone from pharmaceutical firms to a young artist who,\r\naccording to Ackerman, assured him that she would make tasteful use of\r\nthe images.\r\n\r\nLuckily from a bandwidth perspective, you didn’t have to download all of\r\nJernigan. Each slice was a mere seven megabytes in a spatial resolution\r\nof 2,048 by 1,216 pixels (several times sharper than that of a typical\r\npersonal computer). A maker of software for ophthalmologists could pull\r\ndown only the images dealing with the eye and related brain areas. Those\r\naiming for the podiatry market could focus on the feet and ankles.\r\nWhat’s more, even without a license, ordinary Net users could dial up\r\nJernigan Lite, so to speak, from the World Wide Web.\r\n\r\nComing over the Net eventually would be more than just the raw,\r\nunprocessed images. Refined versions—for example, animated Jernigans,\r\nrotating in 3-D, or even virtual reality versions—could go anywhere in\r\nthe world. And when they did, researchers and students would be wanting\r\ntheir own pet views. CD-ROMs just didn’t store enough data to anticipate\r\nall the possibilities. Typically they could hold maybe 650 megabytes of\r\ndata. Even extended, the storage would offer a fraction of what could be\r\navailable via high-speed connections to sites from Paris to Melbourne.\r\n\r\nJernigan, you might say, was more than just the material for a medical\r\nexperiment. He was also a focus of a research project to develop special\r\nformats for libraries of visual information on the Net. Eventually\r\npeople would be able to download not just images but also the “objects”\r\nthat made up the images.\r\n\r\n“These objects will have knowledge in them,” Michael Ackerman said, “so\r\nthey know how they relate to each other and the rest of the scheme. Say\r\nyou ask for the heart. What you get of course is the not a picture of\r\nthe heart but the objects that made up the heart that your software has\r\nnow rendered as the heart. If you point to something on the heart, it\r\ncan open up because it’s made up of these objects. And if you point to\r\nsomething on the margin of the heart and say “What is attached here?”\r\nthat object on the margin knows what its nearest neighbor is even though\r\nit’s not in the picture. And it knows to go back to the database and\r\nbring up what’s attached to it.”\r\n\r\nSuch an approach might even take advantage of Web-style technology to\r\nlink together libraries at a number of locations. So you might smoothly\r\ntravel from, say, a processed image of a blood vessel done up at School\r\nX to an animated image of a heart as tweaked by Company Y.\r\n\r\nThose uses would increase the load on the Internet, of course. But\r\nultimately the principle of the expanding pipeline might work to the\r\nbenefit of all. That is, the heavier the traffic on the Net, the heftier\r\nthe connections would be built. So in the end, everything would be\r\ncheaper—from image transmissions to sending one-page notes by electronic\r\nmail. The challenge, of course, was for this to happen without the costs\r\nof ordinary Net users being driven up by the workload that the image\r\nlibraries and similar endeavors would bring about. That’s where TeleRead\r\nmight come in. It could systematically promote the mass use of\r\nelectronic forms for tax documents, business transactions, and other\r\npurposes. And indirectly the money saved on paperwork could go not only\r\ntoward a national library but also to help upgrade the present Internet\r\nfor researchers and the world at large.\r\n\r\nRight now people tended to see the applications of the Net in terms of\r\none use versus another—in terms of money for low-cost networks for\r\nconsumer education versus high-bandwidth connections of the kind that\r\nAckerman wanted. With a TeleRead-style approach and enough imagination,\r\nhowever, we could take full advantage of the economies of the\r\ntechnology. And so although we would not end the clashes between Net\r\nusers with different priorities, we could at least reduce them.\r\n\r\nSeveral other cost-related questions arose beyond those of the expense\r\nof the network connections. I wondered how much patients would be\r\ncharged to see a picture of the innards of Jernigan or a Visible Woman.\r\nRobert Butler doubted that his client, Glaxo, was ready to say. However,\r\nhe left me with the impression that this probably would not be pay per\r\nview. Glaxo had its own reasons for going ahead—for example, showing\r\ndoctors the effects of its pharmaceuticals on the body. So, no, he said,\r\nthis was not a plot to gouge the public with peep shows.\r\n\r\nA related issue, arising from the involvement of drug companies, was the\r\nquestion of proprietary information. While the images were on the\r\nInternet for all to see, this project was not entirely in the spirit of\r\nthe Net’s openness. Butler, for example, might have feared that I was\r\nworking for a rival corporation, and he waited several weeks to return\r\nmy calls. I could understand his reasons. Still, I was startled to learn\r\nthat Ackerman at the National Institutes of Health would not even\r\nrelease to me a list of the companies that had licensed the use of the\r\nimages. Nor had NIH organized a newsgroup or a mailing list. Surely all\r\nthe hundreds of licensees would have common problems, common\r\nopportunities, that they could discuss without imperiling each other’s\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\nYet another question went back to one of the main reasons given for the\r\nproject. Could medical students really learn by hooking into the Net and\r\ndialing up the images from the Visible Man? David Dean should have been\r\na complete booster of this endeavor. He was, after all, a Ph.D. who\r\nworked in medical imaging and taught anatomy at Case Western Reserve\r\nUniversity. And yet he told me, “I feel you can’t replicate the\r\nexperience in the anatomy lab. Students will have no time for this\r\nstuff. They’re totally overwhelmed. They can see the same structures\r\nagain and again in different bodies.”\r\n\r\nAt the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, Gerry Oxford,\r\nprofessor of physiology, said that seeing organs in three dimensions\r\nwasn’t the same as _feeling_ them. “Physicians in training need a\r\nvisceral appreciation of the fact that they will have responsibility for\r\nthe human body.” Even a believer in the project, Marc Nelson, assistant\r\ndean of medical education at the Stanford University School of Medicine\r\nin Palo Alto, worried that electronic anatomy could lessen contacts\r\nbetween students and teachers.[5.8]\r\n\r\nReal bodies, however, cost universities $600 each—assuming they could\r\nget them in the first place. And students would not have eyeballs,\r\nhearts, hands, and livers to themselves.\r\n\r\nOf all the boosters of the project, Martha Pelster may have been the\r\nmost persuasive. She worked as a lab assistant, had cut up dozens of\r\nbodies, and now was headed to medical school. “When you look at this\r\ncadaver,” Pelster said of the digitized Jernigan, “everything is still\r\nin its orientation. When you go in and dissect, you take a lot of stuff\r\nout. If you cut something wrong or cut through something and toss the\r\nobject into the reject bin, you’ve lost it. But with this visible male,\r\nyou can go back in again. You can see what happened before your lab\r\npartner went in there and messed up your cadaver. This cross-sectional\r\nanatomy is going to be the be-all and end-all. A book can’t have this\r\nmany cross sections, this good.”\r\n\r\nJust as important, no one in the project, from Ackerman to Pelster, was\r\ntouting electronic cadavers as a complete substitute for the real ones\r\nthat the medical students studied. The digitized versions would simply\r\naugment the real cadavers, the ones that you couldn’t reboot if you cut\r\nthem the wrong way. In the new era, medical schools could even require\r\nstudents to put the human body together, not just take it apart.\r\n\r\nCadavers in cyberspace would offer yet another advantage: even\r\nschoolchildren could study them. People for the Ethical Treatment of\r\nAnimals and some rock-n-roll musicians such as Pearl Jam were asking\r\nschools to “cut out dissection” and use computer imaging or model frogs.\r\nThanks to the Visible Human Project, however, students someday would do\r\nbetter than just viewing pixels flashing across the screen. They would\r\nbe able to tour the body of an actual human. Potential medical students,\r\nmoreover, could get a head start. Long before they reached the slicing\r\nrooms, they would be familiar with electronic cadavers and be able to\r\nmake better use of the real ones. What’s more, the digitized Jernigan\r\ncould revolutionize training in laparoscopic surgery, where doctors\r\ninserted tubes in patients and operated with tiny instruments and\r\nTV-like monitors and cameras. The view on the video screen of a training\r\ncomputer could be true to life.\r\n\r\nAll this was not even to mention other applications—for example,\r\ncomputer-simulated crash tests to improve auto safety, efforts to study\r\nthe range of wrist motion and reduce carpal tunnel syndrome in typists,\r\nor investigations of ways to protect athletes against injuries.\r\n\r\nI asked Mark Ticer if Jernigan’s family had ever thought of suing for\r\nany of the wealth that the project might create from medical products\r\nand the rest.\r\n\r\nThe answer pleased me in this litigious era. Ticer said that if anything\r\nthe family would be offended that anyone raised the issue. That was the\r\nway Jernigan and his kin were. “There wasn’t a condition attached to his\r\ngift,” Ticer said.\r\n\r\nSharon Kuster, Jernigan’s sister, said her brother would “probably be\r\nhappy about it. I am.”\r\n\r\n“Now he can be remembered for all the good he did rather than all the\r\nevil,” Ticer said. “I think he’d be quietly delighted.” I picked up on\r\nthe “quietly.” Jernigan’s invisibility, prior to his crimes, was not\r\njust because of his station or lack of station in life. That was his\r\nway. Many other inmates on death row gravitated toward microphones.\r\nJernigan spurned them. The true crime book, if one ever resulted, would\r\nnever have come out while he was walking and breathing.\r\n\r\nShortly after I talked to Mark Ticer and Sharon Kuster, my friend Karen\r\ngot the results of an intensive examination by a second doctor. It\r\nseemed that Karen would not be undergoing the heart surgery. But even\r\nnow she couldn’t tell for sure. What’s more, if Karen received drugs\r\ninstead, the medical benefits of the Visible Man might still help her\r\nsomeday; a major pharmaceutical company, after all, was hoping to use\r\nthe digitized cadaver as a tool to explore and demonstrate the effects\r\nof its products.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts shifted back to Jernigan the human. Lying on the death\r\ngurney, awaiting the poison, would he have wanted to make The Gift if\r\nsomeone had rushed in and asked at the last minute, “Do you realize\r\nyou’ll be all over the Internet? That you’ll suffer the ultimate\r\ninvasion of privacy? That strangers from here to Oslo will see your\r\nguts?” I’d like to think that Jernigan would have nodded and the Learjet\r\nwould still have flown the body up to Denver. For the sake of Karen, of\r\nother sick people, of those who just might live longer and better if\r\ntheir surgeons were slightly more skilled, or if they themselves could\r\nmake the right decisions about their medical care—for the sake of them\r\nall, I was not-so-quietly delighted that the invisible man was now\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nSchools: Park View Educational Centre\r\n\r\nThe big motto out of the United States, in the 1990s, seemed to be,\r\n“Build jail cells, not classrooms.” Again and again, politicians would\r\npromise to shrink the bloat in school budgets while Fighting Crime; I\r\nshared some of their skepticism toward the edutocracy. Washington, D.C.,\r\nwas Exhibit A here. In one recent year the city had shelled out half a\r\nbillion on public schools but paid just $2 million for books.\r\n\r\nSuppose, however, that U.S. schools had been spending their money in a\r\nway that helped keep children out of jail and helped them learn.\r\nAmericans might do well to study Park View Education Centre. It is a\r\nhigh school up in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, and something\r\nweird and wonderful had been happening there over the past few years. At\r\nPark View the Internet was not reserved just for the usual suspects—the\r\nwould-be Bill Gateses, the local Steve Jobses, the prodigies who already\r\nowned PCs and Macs and were dialing up Christie Brinkley photos on\r\nelectronic bulletin boards. Many of the children on the Net were the\r\nat-risk students, those in danger of leaving Park View because of\r\nacademic or disciplinary problems.\r\n\r\nThey were in the “general-stream” track. And just as in the States, the\r\ncollege-bound children looked down on them. That was unfair. Many of the\r\ngeneral students were bright and simply didn’t want to go to college.\r\nSome of the general boys, not all, wore black leather jackets, tight\r\njeans, and black boots. And they used razor blades to tattoo the logos\r\nof Ford and Chevy onto their skins. The at-risk girls were less\r\ncolorful. But some had disciplinary problems of their own, along with\r\nthe same lack of interest in academics. What’s more, certain teenagers\r\nin the area were doing marijuana and hashish and boozing it up; teachers\r\nat Park View worried constantly that the wilder of the students would\r\nturn up on the police blotters.\r\n\r\nFighting against pot smoking and other behavior of the Jernigan variety,\r\nsome teachers at Park View systematically used the Net to bolster the\r\negos of the general students while also improving their scholastic\r\nskills. Yes, alarms went off in my head when I heard the word\r\n“self-esteem.” Too often, at least in the States, this quality came at\r\nthe cost of academics. Saying, “You’re good!” was not enough. Gold\r\nstars—if dishonestly earned—would just teach the children that the\r\neducators were liars.\r\n\r\nSome teachers at Park View Education Centre, however, were mixing\r\nself-esteem with reading and writing in a way that true Net nerds would\r\nlove. And it was happening in a cash-strapped place a continent removed\r\nfrom Silicon Valley in both distance and technical expertise.\r\n\r\nThis was not borderline Canada. Park View Education Centre was a good\r\ntwo days’ drive from the state of Maine. The school served Lunenburg\r\nCounty, a mostly rural area settled by German-speaking people whose\r\ndescendants still reverted to dialect. Bridgewater (pop. 9,000 or so)\r\nwas the nearest town. Named for the modest bridge across the La Havre\r\nRiver, it was in many respects All Canadian—with streets with names like\r\n“King” and “Queen” and “Prince.” Businesses such as Gow’s Hardware and\r\nRofihe’s Men’s Wear had been in the same families for generations. The\r\nBridgewater area boasted a Michelin tire plant, too, and a mall and twin\r\ncinemas. And it was growing. But many inhabitants were displaced\r\nfarmers, lumberjacks, and cod fishermen; tensions from work or the lack\r\nof it could show up in some homes, to the disadvantage of the children.\r\nWhen I was researching this chapter, Canada’s unemployment rate was 10\r\npercent, while Lunnenburg County’s was 12-13 percent.\r\n\r\nIn at least one way, Park View Education Centre may have reflected both\r\nthe business climate and the Canadian winters, or perhaps just some of\r\nthe educational crazes of yesteryear. Park View was built in the late\r\n’70s with narrow little windows that more or less cheated the classrooms\r\nof a river view. Those slots were somewhat emblematic; many children\r\nhadn’t been outside Nova Scotia. Even among the academic-track students,\r\nfewer than 40 percent were making it to college. Park View, then, was\r\nnot quite the stereotypical place for educational high tech.\r\n\r\nStill, the provincial government, colleges, and the business community\r\nhad been quietly working with Park View and other schools to upgrade the\r\nworkforce. In this spirit an education professor at Mount Saint Vincent\r\nUniversity, in Halifax, organized a project called Learning Connections.\r\nPitching in was the Nova Scotia Technology Network. One idea was to use\r\ncomputers to hook students in with employers by way of the Internet to\r\ngive them a taste of the workplace. It would happen. But something would\r\novershadow it—student-to-student communication over the Net.\r\n\r\nJeff Doran, a technophobic English teacher at Park View, wasn’t sure\r\nwhat to think when he first heard of the grand plans. His tenth grade\r\nclass of general students did not exactly teem with computer nerds. Many\r\nof the children had flunked a grade. “Some of them had reading levels\r\ndown around grade three or four. One or two maybe would have been\r\nconsidered at a grade ten level. I didn’t have any goal except to try to\r\nkeep them in school and keep them in class.” He also had his share of\r\nquestions about the project itself. “All we were told was that we would\r\nget some computers, and then we’d get this connection through the phone\r\nlines, and the students would be able to write to people around the\r\nworld, and then when the project was over at the end of the year, we\r\ncould keep the hardware. I had no idea what we were then going to do\r\nwith it, and I certainly had never used it before.” Doran didn’t even\r\nown a television or answering machine. “I still had a phonograph. But I\r\ndidn’t even have a tape player, and I had been writing on the typewriter\r\nall my life.”\r\n\r\nBut Doran had something else going for him, something even more helpful\r\nthan technological expertise. And that was an abundance of good,\r\nteacherish skills and empathy for his students, even the ones with the\r\ntattoos. He himself had rebelled. A Harvard graduate, he had fled the\r\nUnited States during the Vietnam War to avoid the draft. Doran’s exact\r\npolitical beliefs weren’t the point here, though; a dare-devil Green\r\nBeret might have shown the same ability to brook the foibles of the\r\ngeneral students. What mattered was that Doran cared more about results\r\nthan about whether the children followed every little rule. Above all he\r\ncultivated rather than feared the students’ ability to think on their\r\nown.\r\n\r\nThe Nova Scotia Technology Network provided some technical help, but\r\nwould not instantly answer every question. “So,” Doran recalled, “we did\r\na lot of muddling through ourselves and a lot of teaching of each other.\r\nAnd that was one of the best things. Some of the students became\r\nteachers because they learned by experimenting, and then they showed\r\neach other. And invariably they showed me, and so I learned from them.\r\nThe first thing I discovered was that there could be no front of the\r\nroom. It had twelve computers in it that circled around the walls. And\r\nthere was no way that I could stand at any point and demand everybody’s\r\nattention. I learned that in about three minutes of the first period.”\r\n\r\nSignificantly, Jeff Doran’s English class for general students had a\r\none-to-one ratio between students and computers, a stark contrast to\r\nthose in just about all other public schools in Canada and elsewhere.\r\nStudents could use the machines not only for networking but also for\r\nword processing. In fact, they started using the machines so often that\r\nin those early days, Doran was holding classes in the computer lab\r\nregularly rather than in the scheduled rooms.\r\n\r\nI asked Doran which students he remembered most vividly from those first\r\ndays on the Net, and two came to his mind: Betty* and Mac*. Betty was\r\nthe only girl of the twelve students on the first day of school. “She\r\nwas, uhm, kind of an old-fashioned, sweet-faced girl,” Doran said, “with\r\none of the foulest mouths that I ever encountered. Yeah. But she had to\r\nbe to hold her own against these boys. She was surly and sullen and\r\nstubborn with me, and I don’t think she ever actually came to blows with\r\nany of the boys, but she came pretty darned close.” Betty was brighter\r\nthan most in the class. And yet, feisty or not, she lacked\r\nself-confidence. Many would have written her off. More than a few\r\nteachers regarded the general classes as a dumping ground. “She was\r\npretty unimpressed by what she could do in the computer room,” Doran\r\nsaid. “She at first was doing most of her assignments by handwriting.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mac was hardly off to the most promising of starts. His head\r\nwas shaved into a Mohawk. A reform school alum, he was short and stocky\r\nand looked a bit like a small World Wrestling Federation champ,\r\naccording to Doran. Mac’s face bore scars from the fights he got into.\r\nHe would regularly pound the bejeezus out of other teenagers. “I’m not\r\nsure why Mac was in school,” Doran said. “It may have had something to\r\ndo with the law—either school or jail. He was not happy to be here. And\r\nhis skills were very, very low. He was about the lowest I had ever seen\r\nin a student.”\r\n\r\nOkay, so this was the raw material. I didn’t expect Doran to turn either\r\nBetty or Mac into Oxford dons—everything was relative—but I wondered how\r\nfar he had gotten with the computers and the Internet.\r\n\r\n“Well,” Doran said, “once she finally started on the computer, she\r\nstarted writing more than she had ever written before. And I believe\r\nthat’s how you learn to write, by writing.” She organized her sentences\r\nand paragraphs better, her vocabulary expanded, and fewer spelling\r\nerrors popped up in her work—not just because she could spellcheck but\r\nbecause she cared more. Her scrawlings in a loose-leaf notebook hadn’t\r\nlooked so impressive. But now she could use a computer printer and see\r\nthe same, beautiful results as an honors student doing a ten-page\r\nthesis.\r\n\r\n“The second big difference,” said Doran, “was that she was writing\r\ne-mail to other students. Suddenly she had an immediate audience. This\r\nwasn’t some make-believe English project where we would pretend to have\r\na pen pal somewhere and pretend to write to them. This was a real person\r\nwho was going to read that message and respond right away, and that kind\r\nof feedback made her, and made all of the students, suddenly aware of\r\nthe importance of an audience. And an audience in writing is something\r\nthat they had never experienced before, because the audience was the\r\nteacher and who cares what the teacher thinks? Except that the teacher\r\ngives you the mark, so you just write what you think the teacher wants\r\nyou to say.\r\n\r\n“But now Betty and the others had people who would write back and forth\r\nabout their weekends, and their boyfriends, and their dates, and their\r\nsports, and their hobbies, and their cats, and so on. And I think it\r\nopened up a sensitivity to what was acceptable in print, and how your\r\nwords can affect people, and the differences between people—especially\r\nover great distances, because a large number of the students that we\r\nwere writing to in Vancouver were Asian. In fact they were fairly recent\r\nimmigrants to Canada, so their English wasn’t that great. So actually\r\nBetty’s writing skills were better.” And that, in turn, helped her think\r\nbetter of herself.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mac, too, was progressing. At the start Doran gave Mac and\r\nothers a list of twenty words; they were then to look up the definitions\r\nand use the words in sentences. The time limit was four weeks. Mac\r\nneeded the month. He couldn’t even cheat well; copying others’ work, he\r\nblundered because he did not know what he was cribbing. “The last thing\r\nthat he could ever see himself doing,” Doran said, “would be sitting in\r\nfront of a computer, you know, at a keyboard. With these beefy fingers\r\nof his, he was gonna tap away? I mean, that was out of the question.”\r\n\r\nDoran, however, managed to stretch out Mac’s attention span to put up\r\nwith the limits of the machines—to give them the detailed instructions\r\nthey needed. In computerdom, people use the term “boot up” to mean\r\nturning on their machines or loading programs into them. And, Doran\r\nrecalled, “There were times I half expected he was gonna literally boot\r\nthis thing across the room.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Mac snapped back at Doran, “I’ll boot the friggin’ thing up!”\r\n\r\n“And yet,” Doran recalled, “within that one year he was writing messages\r\nto pals in other schools and to me as well.”\r\n\r\nBy then Betty wasn’t just sassing back the boys when they teased her.\r\nShe was actually teaching them how to use the equipment. Her marks shot\r\nup to the 90s. Not content just to write a few short paragraphs, she was\r\nturning out well-organized letters several hundred words long in a\r\nprofessional-looking business format. That was unimpressive by the\r\nstandards of academic students, but a true triumph for Betty; she even\r\nzapped off a paper letter to a suspense novelist she admired. The\r\nwriting skills she developed on the Net had helped make this possible.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously her opinion of herself rose to the point where she was\r\none of the chattier participants in a video that Park View students\r\nhelped make, and that was later shown on a Halifax television station.\r\nStudents shot scenes to send across Canada to counterparts at a school\r\nin Vancouver, British Columbia. And Betty showed up again and again on\r\ncamera. It would have been nice to write that she went on to college,\r\nbut she did not. She ended up a waitress. Partly due to the Net,\r\nhowever, she surely was a better waitress—more at ease with her\r\ncustomers, and better material someday for management if that was what\r\nshe wanted.\r\n\r\nAnd Mac? “One of the last things I got from him,” Doran said, “was a\r\nmessage about how he felt he had been changing that year, and how he had\r\nbeen improving. And I agreed—I thought he had, too. And then just about\r\nthat time, he pulled this stupid move and got drunk while he was on a\r\nclass trip and got kicked out of the school.” But the story didn’t end\r\nthen. “Mac moved to British Columbia and is gainfully employed. In the\r\nboys’ cases, the measure of success is that they are not in jail. In\r\n1990, probably ten boys were at risk of failing and dropping out of\r\nschool. Two were at risk of ending up behind bars or dead.”\r\n\r\nReflecting on past and present students at Park View, Doran noted the\r\nlittle triumphs which led to the big ones. The Net helped whet the\r\nchildren’s interest in school—to the point where, often, just about all\r\nthe students in his first period showed up. It was a virtual miracle,\r\ngiven the sleep hunger of adolescents.\r\n\r\nClearly the Net could be a truant officer’s best friend. “I use\r\ncomputers a lot,” one enthusiastic student e-mailed me from Bridgewater.\r\n“I come in on any free time that I have, I even give up my lunch hour to\r\nplay with the computer, but I would really like to have more class time\r\nin the computer room.” She said that computers “hold so much wonder to a\r\nperson. Like me. Writing on a computer does help out with reading and\r\nwriting skills.” Another student, a tenth grader who lacked a computer\r\nat home, told how much he’d enjoyed corresponding with an aunt and uncle\r\nin Winnipeg. At the time he e-mailed me, his relatives had just had a\r\nson, and his e-mail was going into their baby book. Textbooks alone\r\nwould never, never have encouraged him to look forward to school the way\r\nthe Net did.\r\n\r\nI asked Doran if there were any test scores for the children to document\r\nthe Internet’s benefits to the children at Park View. He said that\r\nscores by themselves would mislead since he had improved as a teacher in\r\nother ways. And yet he believed the Net had helped; since he couldn’t\r\nsupervise the class constantly, he had learned to foster curiosity among\r\nthe students as they explored the Net on their own. He and some other\r\nteachers in the experiment understood that they and the children would\r\nbe learning from each other, that the old authority models were gone.\r\nThe same trend was gradually happening in industry in Canada and the\r\nworld at large. So if Doran wasn’t turning out Ph.D.s, he at least was\r\ncreating better workers.\r\n\r\nOther reasons existed for his success. The videotape reinforced the Net\r\nexperiences. The Park View students looked forward to seeing their\r\ncounterparts. Much more importantly, Doran let children use the Internet\r\nin ways that meant the most to them. The Net was like the videotape.\r\nDoran had expected his students to shoot pictures of quaint homes, of\r\nbeaches, of the usual, touristy sites, when they were showing off the\r\nBridgewater area. Instead the students photographed the places where\r\nthey worked and shopped. And that told all. The e-mail was the same way;\r\nstudents would most benefit from the technology if it was on their own\r\nterms. At Park View, some virtual romances even developed between the\r\nstudents and those elsewhere. One boy wrote to a Florida school asking\r\nto be put in touch with a cheerleader.\r\n\r\nYet another explanation for Doran’s success was that students could\r\nspend hour after hour on their computer. So they had plenty of time for\r\nschool compositions and for writing letters to friends in Vancouver and\r\nelsewhere. (That wasn’t true of all the students in latter years.\r\nAlthough Doran felt they did well, they might have done still better\r\nwith more time.)\r\n\r\nPerhaps most important of all, the machines didn’t put down the general\r\nstudents the way so many humans did. “It’s been my experience that the\r\ntechnology benefits the struggling student much more than it does any\r\nother student—in literacy growth, self-esteem, tech skills,” said Lorri\r\nNeilsen, the education professor at Mount Saint Vincent University who\r\nhad started the Learning Connections project at Park View and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe positives aside, the Bridgewater experiment was not a complete\r\ntriumph. “It’s very important to know the spirit of this project was\r\ncarried by a handful of teachers,” Neilsen said. In fact, just eight of\r\nforty teachers in the school participated in the project. Skeptics were\r\nworried about it taking time away from the usual curriculum. Yet another\r\nproblem was the authority question; some teachers had to know everything\r\nand were nervous about students learning behind their backs. A third\r\ncomplication was gender: Many female teachers were uncomfortable around\r\ntechnology.\r\n\r\nAnswers and solutions existed to all those challenges. In the case of\r\nacademic students, I could appreciate the need to cover a vast range of\r\nsubjects that colleges demanded. But with a TeleRead-style arrangement,\r\njust about all the major resources would be online anyway. Old material\r\nover a period of time could be scanned into the national database—a\r\nhighly economical way to distribute it, and even better by archival\r\ncriteria alone since unread paper material might well disintegrate\r\nanyway without anyone caring about it.\r\n\r\nEven with the Net as it existed then, students of all kinds learned many\r\nshortcuts that enabled them to turn out better papers. The knowledge on\r\nthe Net was far, far shallower on the whole than at, say, the Library of\r\nCongress in the States. But it may well have exceeded what the students\r\ncould find in some small-town libraries. If nothing else, by logging\r\nonto the Net, they could learn how to stay up with the most current\r\nknowledge—no small edge in an era when new products replaced old ones in\r\nmonths rather than in years, and when academic journals proliferated.\r\n\r\nWhat about the authority question? That could diminish in time if\r\nschools of education shifted gears and encouraged teachers to foster\r\ncuriosity rather than have students focus just on textbooks and\r\nteacher-certified facts. Would it happen in the United States without a\r\nconcerted, TeleRead-style effort? Maybe. But I doubted this.\r\n\r\nIf nothing else, public schools needed to give their teachers more time\r\nto master the hardware and the Internet so they would not feel so lost\r\nwhen their students roamed the Net; the equipment alone wasn’t enough.\r\n“Basic technology training is one of the most neglected aspects of\r\neducational reform,” said Andy Carvin, the Net-oriented educational\r\nexpert at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. “More often than not,\r\nwhen a school or a school district implements a major technology\r\noverhaul, teachers are introduced to the Internet and all of its tools\r\nin a day or two of ‘training.’” Carvin told me, and he was right, that\r\nteachers should enjoy regular use of the technology at home and at\r\nschool so the knowledge wouldn’t fade away. Too, they needed to know how\r\nto “combine that knowledge with traditional teaching and\r\ncurricula....It’s like learning to use a telephone—you can be taught to\r\npick up the receiver and press a few numbers, but if you don’t have\r\nanyone else’s number or don’t know how to give out your own number it’s\r\nuseless.”\r\n\r\nI asked Lorri Neilsen about Canada, and she said that schools of\r\neducation up there were making good progress toward correcting\r\ndeficiencies. They had better. In the new era of giant databases there\r\nshould be more emphasis on finding _and_ evaluating information from\r\nmany sources, and less on parroting textbooks. Teachers should encourage\r\nchildren to look for malarkey in all media, but especially on the Net,\r\ngiven all the self-publishing there. Perhaps with more women growing up\r\nwith computers, female teachers in the future wouldn’t suffer so much\r\nfrom the old bugaboos about networks and smart, curious, uppity\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\nThat still left another issue—the possibility that students might send\r\noffensive messages over the Net and perhaps fixate on its wilder areas\r\nsuch as the alt.sex series of newsgroups.\r\n\r\n“We did have a couple of cases of students in the school sending\r\nthreatening and hateful messages,” Doran said, “but these were not my\r\nstudents. These were what I would call hackers, computer nerds.” Later\r\nPark View forced students to sign agreements under which they would lose\r\ntheir privileges if they abused the Net. This was not a hypothetical\r\nissue to me. As I was researching this chapter, I found “Fuck you all”\r\nin the subject line of a public message of a list devoted to educational\r\nuses of the Internet. A student at an American school had taken over\r\nsomeone else’s account. Making students sign agreements wasn’t a total\r\nsolution, but it was a good one. If a student misbehaved and lost Net\r\nprivileges, then he or she would be at a considerable disadvantage in\r\ncompeting with peers.\r\n\r\nAddressing the newsgroup question, Park View filtered out the groups it\r\ndeemed objectionable. I suspected that a smart student could circumvent\r\nthese precautions, but if that happened, he might well have been\r\nintelligent enough to cope with the virtual temptations.\r\n\r\nOff the Net, at any rate, students could just as well find questionable\r\nreading material. I remembered the pictures of Marilyn Monroe that my\r\nclassmates passed around in elementary school back in the 1950s. Did\r\nanything change? Should we really deprive children of the glories of the\r\nNet under the assumption that the kids were all potential pervs? The\r\nbest approach was the Park View—one making children sign agreements that\r\nthey would be responsible for their own actions, and suspending or\r\nending their much-cherished Internet privileges if they abused them.\r\n\r\nRisks aside, the Internet was a natural place for students of all kinds.\r\nOnly a fool would dwell on the hazards of the net to the exclusion of\r\nthe possibilities there.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWould that all activities of government be as benign (well, for the most\r\npart) as those of the schools. In the next chapter we’ll learn about\r\nPhil Zimmermann and his brushes with the darker, almost Big Brotherish\r\nside of government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER\r\n                                  SIX\r\n\r\n    Governments and the\r\n    Net: Making Sure\r\n    Orwell Was Wrong\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a programmer named Phil Zimmermann had his druthers, he would be\r\nleading a pretty sedate life on the whole. He drives a Saturn, lives in\r\na small house in a middle-class suburb in Colorado with his wife and\r\nchildren, and dons a suit and does a pretty good yuppie act when he\r\nconsults for East Coast companies. In California he fits in with his\r\nblue jeans. Short and paunchy, he is bearded yet harmless.\r\n\r\nSome American bureaucrats, however, would lump Zimmermann in with CIA\r\nturncoats and peddlers of illegal plutonium. In November 1994 customs\r\nagents detained him at a Washington-area airport when he was reentering\r\nthe States from Eastern Europe. Twice they combed through his bags then\r\nwarned him that in the future he might be in for more of the same.\r\n\r\nWhy this Kafkaesque treatment? Because many in the U.S. national\r\nsecurity establishment hate Phil Zimmermann’s guts. He came up with\r\nPretty Good Privacy, or PGP for short—a snoop-resistant way of\r\ntransmitting e-mail over the Internet and other networks.\r\n\r\nZimmermann loathes snoops and jackboots. Clearly he was not in the\r\nformer communist Europe to subvert democracies; in fact, he was telling\r\npeople how encryption[6.1] could help preserve their freedom. “I don’t\r\nhave to explain to Eastern Europe,” he said, “why it is important for\r\ntheir governments not to get too powerful.”[6.2]\r\n\r\nThis dictator-proofing helped win Phil Zimmermann a “Pioneer Award” from\r\nthe Electronic Frontier Foundation, the civil liberties group, which\r\npraised him for creating “a worldwide standard for e-mail encryption.”\r\n\r\nZimmermann, however, as the Net’s many libertarians are quick to note,\r\nmay end up in jail for allegedly having violated an American export law\r\nthat carries penalties as high as a decade in prison and a\r\nmillion-dollar fine. The Feds treat PGP-style software as a weapon just\r\nlike Stealth bombers, ballistic missiles, and nuclear warheads. And some\r\nWashington bureaucrats hate the idea of such a privacy protector in the\r\nhands of too many civilians who are not, well, Washington bureaucrats.\r\n\r\nEven if the Feds don’t indict and convict Zimmermann, the U.S.\r\ngovernment has already done its share of bullying here.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Constitution forbids prosecutors from dragging Zimmermann into\r\nan overlit room and interrogating him without a lawyer present. Tell\r\nthat to Washington, however. Although the law bans the export rather\r\nthan the import of powerful encryption software, customs agents at\r\nDulles Airport, eager for any excuse they could find, quizzed Zimmermann\r\nwhen he _returned_ from Eastern Europe. An oft-zealous enemy of privacy,\r\nthe Clinton Administration has even promoted the manufacture of\r\nencryption devices that would let Feds listen in on supposedly\r\nconfidential phone calls. Washington is also spending billions of tax\r\ndollars to make telephone lines more susceptible to tapping.\r\n\r\nZimmermann, meanwhile, has been working on a phone-style piece of\r\nsoftware. Used on the right computer with a $50 sound card and a $7\r\nmicrophone, it would let people speak securely over the Internet or\r\nordinary phone lines.\r\n\r\nBill Clinton’s snoops must love Zimmermann about as much as they enjoy\r\nstatic during wiretaps. Here’s a man who they fear could break the\r\nconnection altogether. Many in Washington, especially FBI Director Louis\r\nFreeh, would love to see unauthorized encryption banned entirely, the\r\nreal issue here. And Republican Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa has\r\nproposed to make it a crime to distribute scrambling programs by way of\r\ninternational nets if the Feds lacked the electronic keys to defeat\r\nthem. The Grassley measure would even ban some software now classified\r\nas exportable.\r\n\r\nLike it or not, however, Washington no longer can control the fate of\r\nindustrial-strength encryption.\r\n\r\nFar too many Americans—and Russians, Germans, Czechs, Iranians,\r\nSingaporeans, Malaysians, Japanese, Chinese, you name it—know about the\r\ntechnology. The Feds instead should focus on different law enforcement\r\ntechniques, and on powerful computers to unravel the bad guys’ codes.\r\nBut the Clinton people and their allies won’t budge. They keep dreaming\r\nof the mass use of D.C.-blessed hardware and software to let law\r\nenforcement people listen in on supposedly confidential phone calls.\r\nJust like the old Soviet KGB, the Feds think that bureaucracy can\r\nprevail over technology, and that government has a God-given right to\r\nforce citizens to be snoop-friendly.\r\n\r\nThe saga of Phil Zimmermann is hardly the only indication that _some_\r\nBig Brotherism is alive and well in the United States—especially when\r\none considers other outrages, such as the recent net.censorship jihad or\r\nthe elitist copyright proposals that would crimp public debate.\r\n\r\nIn all fairness, the United States is less backwards on encryption\r\nmatters than are countries such as France, which bans powerful\r\ncryptography for private use.[6.3] And certainly Bill Clinton isn’t a\r\ndictator. In fact, the trouble with him, at least at the personal level,\r\nis the opposite: He is too much of a wimp to resist civil liberties\r\nthreats from the FBI, the National Security Agency, other bureaucracies,\r\nand the more maniacal of the “law-and-order” crowd on the Hill.\r\n\r\nWhatever Clinton’s problem, though, his encryption policy is making him\r\nreviled among many skeptical young people in Generation Net, not to\r\nmention the baby boomers, who suffered lie after lie from LBJ and Robert\r\nMcNamara during the Vietnam War. A lifelong Democrat, I voted for\r\nClinton. I might not again. His constitutional lapses, or at least those\r\nof his bureaucrats, just might help pave the way for true Orwellian\r\nscenarios in the United States and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSo might the shameful war that a powerful Clinton appointee has waged\r\nagainst public libraries, one of society’s best defenses against\r\nOrwellian Ministries of Truth.\r\n\r\n“Making Sure Orwell Was Wrong,” then, is an apt sub-title for this\r\nchapter. You’ll remember the basics of the novel _1984_—bureaucrats\r\ntinkered with back issues of the _London Times_ to suit the policies of\r\nthe moment, brainwashed the proles of Oceania, and spied on most\r\neveryone with TV cameras. All had to obey the mythical Big Brother. The\r\nmost vivid image from _1984_ was a boot smashing again and again into a\r\nman’s face. In the era of mainframe computers bigger than overgrown\r\nCadillacs, many critics of the Vietnam War invoked Orwell and similar\r\npessimists. Wouldn’t pasty-faced drones in windowless rooms use the\r\ntechnology to keep dossiers on us?\r\n\r\nThen microcomputers popped up. Suddenly good people could use bits and\r\nbytes to fight back against Big Brother. Amnesty International, for\r\nexample, could keep databases documenting murder, torture, and other\r\ncrimes by dictators. And then, via the Internet and other networks,\r\nAmnesty could spread the news around and marshal world opinion against\r\nthe thugs. Other human rights groups and environmental organizations\r\nbenefited, too, and soon most everyone agreed about high tech: George\r\nOrwell had been wrong. Progressives with unpopular ideas celebrated the\r\nnew tools available to them. And conservatives didn’t disagree that Big\r\nBrother was dead; if microcomputers could nurture freedom and diversity,\r\nwhy worry so much about antitrust laws and other regulations? A New York\r\nthink-tanker would eventually write a reverse _1984_ in which hackers\r\nwon over Big Brother.[6.4]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, an open government movement was growing on the Internet,\r\nalong with efforts to use networks as an efficient conduit for services.\r\nFar from being Big Brotherish in all ways, Clinton’s people commendably\r\nput a wealth of official documents on the Net, everything from White\r\nHouse speeches to reports from the Agriculture Department. The states,\r\ntoo, acted. Californians could track down a complete set of laws and\r\nproposed laws on the Internet. North Carolinians could hook into an\r\nelectronic job bank, indicate their desired kind of work, click on a map\r\nto designate a favored location, and watch jobs pop up. Oregonians could\r\nget fishing-and hunting-license information online.\r\n\r\nBureaucrats in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand,\r\nArgentina, Finland, Austria, Poland, Japan, and a host of other\r\ncountries went on the Net to one extent or another.\r\n\r\nEven Singapore, hardly famous for civil liberties and freedom of\r\ninformation, took a few steps to open up. I was surprised and pleased to\r\nfind on a government server a 1993 _Wired_ article with the\r\nnot-so-flattering title of “The Intelligent Island?” Like many\r\ncountries, Singapore faced a dilemma. Would the country’s strict culture\r\nsuffer if the masses were allowed access to the Net? Singapore had\r\nflogged an American teenager merely for vandalizing automobiles; imagine\r\nif authorities instead had caught him in a sex act with a local. The\r\nwhip was in character; it was a source of local pride, not shame. And\r\nyet if Singapore didn’t truly open itself on the Internet, if it\r\ncouldn’t provide a hospitable electronic environment to\r\nmegaconglomerates, the country would fall behind nations with a freer\r\nflow of information.\r\n\r\n“Most Singaporeans are little rule followers,” a local hacker told\r\n_Wired_. “They are used to being spoon-fed what they are supposed to\r\nknow by the government.” He predicted that Singapore would turn into a\r\n“controlled information center. The government will try to suppress\r\nhackers.”[6.5] And yet the very distribution of the article—for all to\r\nsee on a Web server, amid official government documents—told me that the\r\nOrwellian scenario was not a full certainty. If _Singapore_ could ease\r\nup a little, there might yet be a little hope for the rest of the\r\ncosmos.\r\n\r\nHowever, the need for some healthy paranoia remains, even if, yes,\r\nOrwell overstated his case. An Internet Central doesn’t exist for\r\nbureaucrats to shut down, of course; messages can arrive by way of many\r\npaths, and electronic mail if need be can travel over normal voice\r\nlines. But martinets of all ilks can’t resist the urge to censor or\r\nunplug. A government computer in Canada is rumored to be programmed to\r\nreject Anglo-Saxonisms as passwords, and I don’t doubt it. Would that\r\nall outrages were so funny.\r\n\r\nClaiming software piracy, cops shut down the electronic bulletin boards\r\nof scores of Italian progressives. “In some places,” the activist\r\nBernardo Parrella reported, “sleeping people were abruptly woken up\r\nfacing machine guns.” The boards were part of FidoNet, a worldwide BBS\r\nsystem with electronic mail connections to the Internet. Significantly\r\nthe police didn’t undertake similar harassment against the high-tech\r\nadmirers of Hitler and Mussolini. The victims were liberal or left wing.\r\nWithin a year, the Italian cops were back at it again, seizing\r\ncomputers, disks, books, diaries, and other materials from citizens\r\nsuspected of anarchistic sympathies. This time the police made no\r\npretense; the raids were clearly political.\r\n\r\nPoliticians and bureaucrats can be just as prickly about sex as about\r\npolitics. In Singapore, prudes searched the hard disk of computer\r\nsystems to see if the good citizens were enjoying the alt.sex\r\nnewsgroups. And back in the States, Senator J. James Exon of Nebraska\r\nconcocted a nutty scheme to ban “indecent” material from the public\r\nareas of the Net. _1984_ once more came to mind. Big Brother loathed\r\nsex, as Winston Smith, Orwell’s hero, knew all too well in carrying on\r\nan illicit affair with a female bureaucrat.\r\n\r\nJim Exon also hated sex—at least on the Net. I could appreciate his\r\nworries; did nine-year-olds really need to gawk at alt.sex.bestiality,\r\nor kiddie porn, or the next Brandy’s Babes? Exon, though, again and\r\nagain, scrambled his facts. He relied partly on a breathless article\r\nthat the _Washington Post_ had run under the headline “Molesting\r\nChildren by Computer.” Among other things, writer Sandy Rovner had\r\nadvised parents to check their kids’ computers for files ending in\r\n“.BMP”. None other than the Microsoft Windows software, however, left\r\n.BMP files on hard drives—as a way to display images such as the\r\ncorporate logo. Might Microsoft be a new Sodom?\r\n\r\n“Obviously I had not researched the story enough,” Rovner admitted to\r\nher great credit. “I am new to the world of cyberspace.... I have a\r\ncomputer coach, but even he is behind on the Internet. Yes, I violated a\r\ncardinal rule of journalism—I didn’t know enough about what I was\r\nwriting about. And I certainly wasn’t thinking censorship. Mea culpa. I\r\nam a staunch supporter of the First Amendment, as all journalists are or\r\nshould be.” And yet Exon cited “Molesting” on the Senate floor to\r\njustify his repressive, cyberspace-oriented change in the existing\r\nCommunications Decency Act. “Argghh,” went Rovner.\r\n\r\nEven more significantly, Exon, as noted earlier, failed to grasp the\r\ndifference between the Internet and television. Children wouldn’t just\r\nflick on a computer and see a Madonna look-alike climaxing with a German\r\nshepherd. They would have to _look_ for pornography. And the industry\r\nwas ready to work on software, such as SurfWatch, to help parents keep\r\ntheir kids out of pre-designated areas of the Net.\r\n\r\nNothing would be foolproof or teen-proof, of course. Brilliant\r\ntechnologists had designed the Internet to survive 100-megaton H-bombs.\r\n“The Net,” said the hacker John Gilmore in an oft-repeated quote,\r\n“interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.”\r\n\r\nParents’ best response would be at home. Mothers and fathers shouldn’t\r\nexpect Uncle Sam to play nanny. As Steve Case, president of America\r\nOnline, noted in connection with his company, parents should never turn\r\ntheir children loose in a city of millions of people. And I believed\r\nthat the same held true of the Internet. Why should parents count on\r\n_everything_ being constantly under control. Put the Net on a leash\r\nshort enough to suit Exon, and the pornography would still\r\npersist—encrypted and on non-Net bulletin boards if nothing else—but\r\nlegitimate users would suffer. Some Internet providers might even shut\r\ndown to avoid legal liabilities. Moreover, in an era of global commerce,\r\nWashington shouldn’t put America at such a disadvantage. The losses in\r\ntrade and jobs eventually would reach the billions, given the estimated\r\nhundreds of billions of Net-generated business.\r\n\r\n“The only thing that censorship will do is drive the best and brightest\r\nmembers of the U.S. Internet community to countries where they can\r\nexpress themselves without risk of reprisal—and drain the United States\r\nof its valuable intellectual capital,” _Interactive Publishing Alert_’s\r\nRosalind Resnick would later write.[6.6] “Personally I’d rather see a\r\nfew four-letter words flicker across my computer screen every now and\r\nthen than risk losing talented writers, artists and programmers to our\r\neconomic competitors.” A mother of two, she counseled parents: “Keep the\r\ncomputer in a public area of the house, such as the den or living room,\r\nnot in your kid’s bedroom. Warn your kids about the dangers of\r\npedophiles and urge them never to give out their phone number or address\r\nto anyone they meet online.” _That_ was a far better approach than\r\nWashington-mandated net.censorship, one that could work with the\r\nsmartest hacker-child. Even the hyper _Post_ article had played up\r\nsimilar solutions. But Jim Exon couldn’t keep his hands off the Net.\r\n\r\nIn a superb illustration of the dark side of electronic democracy, Exon\r\nheld up a blue binder full of net.smut and, on the C-SPAN television\r\nnetwork, argued for censorship of cyberspace. The vote in the Senate was\r\n84 to 16—how could U.S. senators oppose “decency?” Given all the sex\r\nscandals on the Hill, it was scene worthy of _Elmer Gantry_, the\r\nSinclair Lewis novel about a moralizing preacher who nonetheless\r\nindulges in sex and booze. The book, of course, ends with the Rev.\r\nGantry promising, “We shall yet make these United States a moral\r\nnation.”\r\n\r\nAround the same time the Senate was hoping to Disneyize the Internet,\r\nBob Dole, the Republican majority leader, was protecting Bob Packwood by\r\nopposing a move to open the Ethics Committee hearings into the personal\r\nbehavior of the oversexed senator from Oregon. As reported by the\r\n_Washington Post_, Packwood allegedly had grabbed and kissed scads of\r\nwomen—from campaign workers to female staff members, lobbyists, a hotel\r\nclerk, and a baby-sitter—“sometimes forcing his tongue into their mouth\r\nor fondling them.” Packwood, while not owing up to every particular, had\r\napologized for being “terribly offensive to women.” And now he and Bob\r\nDole had voted for Draconian net.morality? Dole had even teamed up with\r\nseveral other senators, including Charles Grassley, the champion of\r\nsnoop-friendly software, to offer a cyber-censor bill worse even than\r\nExon’s.\r\n\r\nThe ironies wouldn’t stop. None other than Donna Rice, whose escapades\r\nwith ex-Senator Gary Hart had helped kill off his political career, was\r\nnow praying and crusading against cyber smut—as a spokeswoman for an\r\nantiporn group.\r\n\r\nAnother irony hit me. Tobacco and liquor advertisements, which promote\r\nproducts far deadlier to children than any obscenities, were reaching\r\nthe Net. The Internet Sleuth, for example, one of my favorite\r\ncollections of Net indexes, had advertised Smokin’ Joe’s tobacco\r\nproducts over a period of at least several weeks. And yet the Exonians\r\ncould not stop fixating on words and pictures, as opposed to a massive,\r\nproven threat that had killed millions of Americans. I didn’t want the\r\ngovernment to ban even cancer-weed ads from cyberspace, lest the\r\nregulators go wild and try to make the Net TV-bland; but if Exon and\r\nallies had to crusade, they might as well be consistent about it.\r\nPerhaps as a true children’s advocate, Exon could even give back the\r\nmore than $27,000 that his campaign had collected between January 1989\r\nand December 1994 from the tobacco and liquor industries. That was just\r\na fraction of his total take, but a statement just the same. Maybe the\r\noperators of “adult” bulletin board systems—who used the Net to post\r\nsamples, the real source of the problem—could befriend Exon-style pols\r\nwith a well-funded political-action committee. “PornoPAC”?\r\n\r\nI wondered what would happen next if the net.censors won in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. Earlier, in chapter 4, I had quoted Peter Lewis of the\r\n_New York Times_ as alluding to the “pencil-dicked geeks” who flamed\r\nhim. Would Washington let _NetWorld!_ go out over an Exonized Internet?\r\nThis was the only time I had ever seen such language in e-mail from\r\nLewis, a gifted professional. Society didn’t prevent a woodcarver from\r\nusing a certain kind of wood just because hoodlums might buy some\r\nbaseball clubs made from it and split each other’s skulls open. Why,\r\nthen, draft legislation that so despicably intruded on writers’ work?\r\nAnd what about teachers and students of literature, including bright,\r\nstable teenagers under eighteen? Or readers who just loved good,\r\nexpressive writing? Knowingly or not, the savages in the Senate could be\r\nbanning even _Ulysses_ from the public area of the Internet. Never mind\r\nthe forthcoming age of electronic books; might Washington someday go on\r\nto suppress the paper editions from stores and libraries?\r\n\r\nQuite correctly the Electronic Frontier Foundation warned of the folly\r\nof turning the public regions of the Internet into “the equivalent of\r\nthe Children’s Room at the public library,” and forcing Netfolks to seek\r\nout “adult” areas. Get carried away on an Exonized Net, use the wrong\r\nword, and the Feds could fine you up to $100,000 and jail you for up to\r\ntwo years. Even in private e-mail you’d need to behave yourself: You\r\ncould not harass anyone with an “obscene” remark or image, lest he or\r\nshe report you. What if an ex-lover took innocent comments and put them\r\nin the wrong context? Tough luck. Sooner or later the courts would\r\nprobably clean up after the politicians and toss out the censorship, but\r\nthat would hardly matter to the many who suffered in the meantime.\r\n\r\nIn July 1995 the censorship debate was still at full blast. Just as Jim\r\nExon had relied on the misleading _Post_ story, so did his side brandish\r\na sensationalistic _Time_ magazine cover. A shocked, wide-eyed child\r\ngaped at “CYBERPORN,” as the headline described it “EXCLUSIVE: A new\r\nstudy shows how pervasive and wild it really is. Can we protect our\r\nkids—and free speech?” Out of character, Philip Elmer-DeWitt, one of the\r\nmost Net-aware of all the reporters in the mass media, had relied on a\r\nflawed paper out of Carnegie Mellon University. The student perpetrator\r\nof the study, one Martin Rimm, had overgeneralized, and two professors\r\nat Vanderbilt disemboweled him with a 9,000-word rebuttal on the World\r\nWide Web. If nothing else, the Rimm study had blurred the distinction\r\nbetween bulletin board systems and the Internet itself and also confused\r\nUsenet with the Net as a whole.\r\n\r\nCarnegie Mellon investigated whether Rimm had violated people’s privacy.\r\nMost deliciously of all, however, from a Net perspective, he had written\r\nsomething else—a self-published novel with such picturesque terms as\r\n“rectum rocket.” Would that Sinclair Lewis and H. L. Mencken had been\r\naround to chronicle the circus.\r\n\r\nOver on the House side, Speaker Newt Gingrich sensibly let his\r\nlibertarian side prevail and opposed Exon. I wasn’t surprised. How could\r\nGingrich play nanny while railing in general against regulation and\r\nbureaucracy, especially when he himself had set up shop as a novelist?\r\nMy fellow liberals, though, were amazed. It was as if they were watching\r\nthe T-Rex in _Jurassic Park_ gobble up a velociraptor that was about to\r\nenjoy a human snack.\r\n\r\nMaybe the Exon-style proposals by now will have suffered the fate of the\r\nsmaller dinosaur, but similar lunacy is bound to break out anew.[6.7]\r\nAmong some on Capitol Hill, the urge to censor is as powerful as the\r\npassion for reserved parking places.[6.8]\r\n\r\nIf the censors do win, their narrow-mindedness may backfire in ways\r\nbeyond the ones I’ve already described—and these risks will only grow in\r\nthe future, as the Net becomes still more international. Puritanical\r\ncountries such as Singapore might arbitrarily jail visiting Americans\r\nwho, from the States, had made Internet postings deemed offensive by the\r\nstandards of local dictators.[6.9] The possibilities are endless. A U.S.\r\nnovelist passing through a Mideastern country could become the next\r\nRushdie if the local ayatollahs deemed his online work offensive.\r\n\r\nClinton’s Feds hardly helped when they went jurisdiction shopping and\r\nprosecuted the owners of a California BBS for sex-related material that\r\nviolated community standards in _Tennessee_. Applied internationally,\r\nthe local-standards principle could send an American to a sword-wielding\r\nexecutioner someday. The Bill of Rights, alas, is just a U.S.\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nExon You!\r\n\r\nWhen the U.S. Senate passed Jim Exon’s net.censorship bill, the\r\njournalist Brock Meeks wrote a lead for the ages: “U.S. Capitol, Senate\r\nGallery—It’s all over. Fuck it.” But what happens if net.censors prevail\r\nsomeday on the House side, too (if they haven’t already), and you can’t\r\nuse the F word? Netfolks have a solution:\r\n\r\n_Just substitute the last name of the senior senator from Nebraska._\r\nEnemies and lovers can then say, “Exon,” to each other.\r\n\r\nThat’s obvious. But the gifted trolls at Bianca’s Smut Shack, spreading\r\na post from the mythical “Ezra Pound Is Innocent Committee,” have\r\nactually promoted a whole new lexicon in honor of Exon and allies. For\r\nexample:\r\n\r\nByrd: (noun) The posterior or hinderparts, specifically the anus.\r\n\r\nCoats: (noun) Excrement, or as a verb to excrete.\r\n\r\nExon: (verb) To copulate with, the act of copulation.\r\n\r\nGorton: (noun) The female genitals, or specifically the vagina.\r\n\r\nGramm: (verb) To orgasm. Also colloquially used as a noun.\r\n\r\nHeflin: (noun) The female secondary sexual characteristics.\r\n\r\nHelms: (noun) The male phallus.\r\n\r\nSpecter: (noun) The clitoris.\r\n\r\nHowever, a borderless Internet can also hinder the censorship crowd. If\r\nAmerican bluenoses such as Exon tried to restrict an electronic _Tropic\r\nof Cancer_, for example, a U.S. publisher just might set up shop in\r\ncountries with less infantile politicians. People in the States could\r\nthen dial up the computer overseas.\r\n\r\nAlready the Net has made fools of martinets in the Canadian government.\r\nOttawa tried to squelch newspaper accounts of a murder, claiming that\r\nthe coverage would preclude a fair trial. So people in the States sent\r\nelectronic care packages to their Canadian friends—articles from U.S.\r\npapers. Canadian officials banned a pulped-wood issue of _Wired_ for\r\nattacking their stupidity; that was one of the biggest debacles of all,\r\ngiven the ease of dialing up electronic versions of the magazine, one of\r\nthe planet’s most plugged-in publications.\r\n\r\nConsider, too, the ramifications of anonymous servers, which strip names\r\nand other identifiers from messages, allowing Netfolks to circumvent\r\nlegal bullying by governments and others. In 1995, the Church of\r\nScientology in Los Angeles got Finnish police to raid a server in\r\nHelsinki that was posting anonymous exposés of this rather litigious\r\norganization. The server survived. But the cops forced Johan Helsingius,\r\noperator of the server, to reveal the name of a Church enemy who\r\noriginated the messages. “Now users fear their secrets are at risk,”\r\n_Time_ said of people using his computer service. Case closed on\r\nanonymous servers? Hardly.\r\n\r\nWithin weeks after the incident I read a note from a hacker telling how\r\nencrypted messages could wend their ways through chains of anonymous\r\ne-mailers in several countries, with the names of the senders remaining\r\nhidden unless most or all of the e-mailers broke under pressure. Yes,\r\nabuses are possible, such as the release of trade secrets, outright\r\nlibels, forgeries, or the most vile and violent of pornography. But how\r\nmuch better to live out this future than one of the Orwellian variety.\r\nTyrant-bashers in the Thirteen Colonies used the wizardry of their day,\r\nthe printing press, to agitate against the Tories; now let’s hope that\r\nif Exonian politicians try to stifle the Net, enough hackers will have\r\ntheir most dangerous presses ready to go, the servers I’ve just\r\ndescribed. Obsolete or not, the censors aren’t going to stop.\r\n\r\nOther Big Brotherish urges have surfaced. While some Power People hope\r\nto be able to learn more about us by fighting PGP-style programs, they\r\nare stymieing our efforts to learn more about _them_. At the same time\r\nthe Feds put online thousands of public documents and even the visage of\r\nBill Clinton’s cat, some politicians on the Hill sought to _weaken_ the\r\nFreedom of Information Act, which makes it easier to dig up dirt on\r\npublic officials. Just as important, Clinton people in early 1995 were\r\nproposing new copyright laws that in effect would discourage the\r\nintelligent discussion of public issues on the Internet. It would be\r\nharder to share electronic newspaper clips. Even more disturbingly,\r\nClinton’s copyright policy could menace our public library system in the\r\nfuture. Bruce Lehman, his czar of intellectual property, was coming\r\nacross as Andrew Carnegie in reverse.\r\n\r\nCarnegie is remembered as a Scot who grew rich off steel in the States\r\nand who encouraged people throughout the world to start libraries for\r\nall. He gave millions toward library buildings, with the understanding\r\nthat the local taxpayers would finance their support. Carnegie wanted\r\npublic libraries to be universities for the common man, and the metaphor\r\nholds up. Today, without paying for college or even for books, Americans\r\ncan educate themselves on subjects ranging from microcomputer chips to\r\nmedieval history, to Alexis de Tocqueville’s writings on democracy, to\r\nthe case for or against feminism or abortion or public broadcasting or\r\ncapital punishment. That is life in the era of paper books.\r\n\r\nIf Lehman had his wishes, however, Americans would not be able to dial\r\nup copyrighted electronic library books from home by way of the Internet\r\nInstead they would have to tote around CD-ROMs and floppy disks.\r\n\r\nWilliam F. Buckley Jr. wrote that, in the era of the Internet, the\r\nLehman vision would be “the equivalent of requiring everyone who listens\r\nto music to buy 78 rpm shellac records. What will the children dial in\r\nto read? The collected speeches of Vice President Al Gore? And believe\r\nit or not, there’s also talk of the Postal Service getting involved in\r\nlocal public libraries through information kiosks.”[6.10] In effect the\r\nWhite House approach would jack up the price of independent, privately\r\noriginated information, while making it easier to obtain\r\nWashington-blessed information.\r\n\r\nThe information kiosks led some librarians to think of noses and camel’s\r\ntents. For the Postal Service at one point said it would let local\r\nlibrarians and citizens use the kiosks to retrieve only designated\r\ncategories of information, as opposed to, say, everything on the World\r\nWide Web. On a 1 to 10 scale of Big Brotherism, the kiosk idea as\r\noriginally proposed was an 8.5 or worse.[6.11] If the postal bureaucrats\r\nweren’t trying to be Big Brother in the strictest sense—and no, they\r\nweren’t—then they at least were unwittingly paving the way for him.\r\n\r\nWorse, the Postal Service has talked of issuing tens of millions of\r\n“U.S. Cards” that would “mediate all government services and controls\r\nover citizens,” while at the same time an Internal Revenue Service\r\nofficial has proposed a system that would file our tax returns for\r\nus.[6.12] I hate both ideas. Rather than compiling Orwellian dossiers on\r\ncitizens, governments should help us computerize via TeleRead-style\r\nprograms so we can more easily do the “paperwork” ourselves by way of\r\nelectronic forms. Investigators could audit the forms, but only under\r\nappropriate circumstances. How much better this would be—not just\r\ne-books, but electronic empowerment against bureaucracy—than the vision\r\nthat Washington and other governments have in mind for us.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Lehman idea and the Postal and IRS plans will have been\r\nbeaten back or rendered harmless by now. Whatever happens, though, it is\r\nclear that new technology may harm both privacy and democracy if our\r\nvigilance lapses.\r\n\r\nThe threat of electronic oligarchy, stanching the free flow of facts\r\nthat intelligent nonmillionaires demand, is hardly unique to the States.\r\nIn the United Kingdom, for example, The _Times Higher Education\r\nSupplement_ has warned against a copyright regime that would be a\r\nparadise for read-o-meter companies but a nightmare to people valuing\r\nfree libraries. Just like Lehman’s proposal in the U.S., the wrong laws\r\nin the U.K. could lead to a Copyright Gestapo; let’s hope that neither\r\ncountry will criminalize one of the prerequisites for democracy:\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nGiven the global nature of both encryption technology and copyright law,\r\nthe whole world should be watching Washington’s policies. The Clinton\r\nAdministration, after all, hopes to internationalize the same mindset\r\nthat could send Phil Zimmermann to jail; in fact, many of the American\r\nexport controls _are_ in effect in other countries, raising the\r\npossibility that an Australian or a British hacker could end up someday\r\nin the same predicament. In the pages that follow I’ll tell about the\r\nbattles that Zimmermann and his allies have fought with Washington.\r\n\r\nYou’ll read, too, of my fight for an alternative to the Lehmanesque\r\ncopyright law. My little case history suggests that the White House is\r\nnot so eager to listen to ordinary mortals who speak up on the Net.\r\nClinton’s people would rather pander to the usual campaign contributors.\r\nSo far at least, pious rhetoric notwithstanding, they have basically\r\nneglected the need to put the public library system online with free or\r\nlow-cost books from the private sector. Video just might end up reigning\r\neven more supreme than it does today—at the expense of abstract thought\r\nand democracy. Winston Smith would not be happy.\r\n\r\nPGP and the Fight for Privacy—and\r\nAgainst Clipper—on the Internet\r\n\r\nFather Bill Morton, an Anglican priest in Woodstock, New Brunswick,\r\ncould take confessions via e-mail without violating his vows. Encryption\r\nsoftware guarded the privacy of his communications. In Florida a bright\r\nteenager without any vices—but with a nosy mother—could protect her\r\ndiaries. And in New York, an employee of a leading investment house\r\ncould routinely guard his credit card number. The same software made it\r\npossible for thousands to use the Net for confidential business\r\ntransactions. At the same time, democratic activists in the former\r\nSoviet Union would be able protect their messages if tyranny returns.\r\n\r\nThe name for this encryption package was PGP and by 1995 it was as much\r\na cause as a program. Thousands had downloaded it off the Internet and\r\nother networks. Named in tribute to Ralph’s Pretty Good Grocery on\r\nGarrison Keillor’s radio show, PGP stood for Pretty Good Privacy. PGP\r\nlived up to its name—people needed it. Part of the reason was the nature\r\nof the Net itself. A skilled hacker could intercept unencrypted e-mail\r\nmore easily than on the regular commercial networks. Mail often passed\r\nthrough computers at a number of universities and companies before\r\nreaching its destination. Without question the best way to protect the\r\ncontents of your outgoing mail was to scramble its message before you\r\nsent it into cyberspace.\r\n\r\nPGP was also popular because its use showed that the Net would never\r\naccept Clipper chip encryption schemes—designed to make it easier for\r\nthe government to snoop on citizens.\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, then, at the time I was writing this book, Phil\r\nZimmermann was a hero to many on the Internet. His program meant\r\ndignity. It meant safer commerce on the Net. Other privacy protection\r\nprograms existed, but his was most popular, making it all the more\r\nuseful. So when the Feds threatened Zimmermann, many people correctly\r\nfelt as if Washington were attacking them along the way. The irony was\r\nthat the federal government’s policies against safe encryption could\r\nactually threaten world security and had already set back efforts on\r\nbehalf of computer security.\r\n\r\nIn a sense the PGP story was part of a continuum, and not just because\r\nthe Egyptians had scrambled messages four thousand years ago or because\r\nencryption had been a staple of Cold Warriors.\r\n\r\nEven while growing up in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, Phil Zimmermann had\r\ntinkered with secret codes. At around age ten he had learned Morse code,\r\nBraille, and, via lemon juice, invisible ink. By his teens he was\r\nbuilding code wheels; at Florida Atlantic University, he kept up his\r\npassion for puzzles and secrets. He started out there in physics;\r\nswitched to computer science; married; packed up for Boulder, Colorado,\r\nwhere he became a computer consultant; and thought of a move to New\r\nZealand. Phil Zimmermann believed it would be safer, in the event of\r\nnuclear war, than Ground Zero countries.\r\n\r\nInstead of leaving the States, however, Zimmermann decided to stay and\r\nhelp throttle back the military. Along with the astronomer Carl Sagan\r\nand Daniel Ellsberg of Pentagon Papers fame—and hundreds of\r\nothers—Zimmermann was arrested at testing grounds in Nevada. Soon his\r\nlove of computers would be converging with his distrust of people in\r\nuniforms.\r\n\r\nZimmermann in the early ’80s was selling a gadget that plugged into an\r\nApple II computer but used an 8088 chip just like the then-new IBM\r\npersonal computer. This gadget was designed to allow people to keep\r\ntheir old Apple hardware and software while running new programs for the\r\nfast new chip. Zimmermann called his company Metamorphic Systems. A\r\nprogrammer from Arkansas saw a Metamorphic ad and called Zimmermann to\r\npitch to him an encryption system that was too long to run on most\r\nmachines. Would Zimmermann care to adapt the system to run on an 8088\r\nchip? He would.[6.13]\r\n\r\nRSA was the encryption method here. Named after its three\r\noriginators—Ronald Rivert, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman—RSA was a\r\nvirtually uncrackable form of public key encryption. So what did _public\r\nkey_ mean? Well, you didn’t have to worry about the wrong set of eyes\r\nseeing the jumble of letters and other characters that made up keys for\r\nmessages transmitted to you. You could freely spread it around. Then\r\nsomeone who wanted to send something confidential to you didn’t have to\r\ncontact you for a secret key known only to you. He could use your public\r\nkey by way of his RSA software.\r\n\r\nSimply put, the public key approach did away with a major problem: how\r\nto send descrambling tools over networks if the information itself\r\nwasn’t secured. People who didn’t know each other could trade public\r\nkeys, then share secrets from the start. They could even use the same\r\nsoftware to verify their identities with the help of trusted third\r\nparties, who “signed” the keys with sequences of their own. Imagine the\r\nmany possibilities for allowing safe business transactions on networks\r\nbetween strangers. A lucrative business just might await Zimmermann if\r\nhe added his own wrinkles.\r\n\r\nWith RSA, however, came a series of legal nightmares for Zimmermann.\r\nStarting work on his own software using RSA, he hadn’t any idea at the\r\nstart that Rivert, Shamir, and Adleman would be claiming a patent on it.\r\n\r\nThe trio farmed their rights out to RSA Data Security and, eventually,\r\nPublic Key Partners. Jim Bidzos, negotiating for RSA, in many ways stood\r\nout as a political and philosophical opposite of Zimmermann. Bidzos\r\ncarried a Greek passport for business reasons but at the same time felt\r\npatriotic enough to have volunteered for the U.S. Marines. The way\r\nBidzos tells the story (to Simson Garfinkel, author of _PGP: Pretty Good\r\nPrivacy_), Zimmermann asked for a “free license” for use of RSA. “When I\r\ntold him ‘No,’” Bidzos said, “he was really upset. He told me that he\r\nwas behind on his mortgage payments and that he had invested years in\r\nwriting this piece of software.” Bidzos said he suggested that\r\nZimmermann try licensing the patent from a larger company.[6.14]\r\n\r\nZimmermann’s own side of the story differed starkly—in 1991 he wrote Jim\r\nBidzos a letter saying that Bidzos and Ron Rivert had told him that “you\r\nwould grant me a free license to make and sell products with your\r\nalgorithm.”[6.15] A few years later he would note to the _Wall Street\r\nJournal_ that he hadn’t sold PGP before his contract with ViaCrypt, one\r\nof RSA’s licensees.[6.16] He steadfastly maintained he had not broken\r\nany laws. Many on the Internet would have agreed, if for no other reason\r\nthan that they considered software patents to be abominations. Without\r\npatents to limit them, many programmers felt they could be more\r\ncreative. Their ethos was quite in line with the traditional Net ethos.\r\nThe predecessor of the Internet, after all, hadn’t just been started to\r\nallow the Pentagon to survive nukes. It also existed to share knowledge.\r\n\r\nBy 1991 the patent issue wasn’t the only one dogging Zimmermann. The\r\nU.S. Senate was considering a law that would in effect ban Fedproof\r\nencryption here in the United States and potentially prevent him from\r\nselling the software on which he had been toiling for years now.\r\nWashington already forbade export of encryption abroad. The Cold War was\r\nwinding down, but export controls were still draconian. Hadn’t we won\r\nWorld War II because our technology was better, because we had had\r\nnukes, because we could even snoop on secret code transmissions from the\r\nenemy? The export laws and the Pentagon put strong encryption equipment\r\nin the same category as munitions.\r\n\r\nBut what about at home? Not surprisingly, the FBI didn’t want the wrong\r\ntechnology to fall into the hands of dope rings, Mafiosi, and others\r\nplanning or coordinating crimes. In 1991, then, perhaps at the Bureau’s\r\nrequest, Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware inserted the following\r\nlanguage into an omnibus crime bill: “It is the sense of Congress that\r\nproviders of electronic communications services and manufacturers of\r\nelectronic communications service equipment shall ensure that\r\ncommunications systems permit the government to obtain the plain text\r\ncontents of voice, data, and other communications when appropriately\r\nauthorized by law.”\r\n\r\nA Senate staffer assured civil libertarians that the measure would not\r\nban strong encryption. Many disagreed. Computer Professionals for Social\r\nResponsibility, library groups, academics, and industry managed to get\r\nWashington to drop the offending language.\r\n\r\nBy then PGP was all over the Net. Smart lobbying, not the software,\r\nkilled the Biden plan. But Zimmermann’s work was still a good, sound\r\nprecaution against a relapse. Via bulletin boards and the Internet, a\r\nfree version was circulating from one end of Planet Earth to the other,\r\nhaving gone overseas within a day of its release. In Zimmermann’s words,\r\nit spread “like thousands of dandelion seeds blowing in the wind.” PGP\r\nreached Russia and scores of other countries. It wasn’t like nuclear\r\nweapons or mini-computers; you couldn’t stop a ship from loading or\r\nsearch the luggage of the suspicious. No, PGP just moved silently over\r\nthe wires as hackers throughout the world shared Zimmermann’s craft. The\r\nway Zimmermann told it, however, he had not broken any of the export\r\nlaws. And others supported him.\r\n\r\nJim Warren, founder of _InfoWorld_ and a software man respected for his\r\ncivic activism on the Net, would later recall that Zimmermann gave PGP\r\nto an acquaintance named Kelly Goen, who “studiously” limited the\r\nuploads to electronic bulletin boards and Internet sites within the\r\nUnited States. Warren was aware of the uploading process while it\r\nhappened. “The whole idea was to provide it to _Americans_,” he would\r\nremember, “so Americans could have personal privacy and security” in\r\ncase the U.S. Senate tried to bottle up decent encryption.[6.17]\r\n\r\nThe National Security Agency—the secret agency that dealt with many of\r\nthe best cryptographers and dominated the encryption scene in the United\r\nStates—did not complain formally when PGP first hit the Net. And\r\nZimmermann fretted. Had his baby failed to safeguard privacy enough to\r\nworry the National Security Agency?[6.18]\r\n\r\nBack at RSA Data Security, Jim Bidzos wasn’t thrilled when PGP appeared\r\nwith RSA technology. He maintained that PGP violated both patent and\r\nexport law, and at his urging, some commercial services and universities\r\nbanished PGP from their servers.[6.19] Legally, Bidzos may or may not\r\nhave been justified. But once again the hacker ethic prevailed on the\r\nNet. Not everyone online took Zimmermann’s side, but by now he was a\r\nserious hero to a group of encryption boosters known as “Cypherpunks,”\r\nthe name that a magazine writer had once given them as a joke.\r\n\r\nMany of the Cypherpunks were libertarians, or variants thereof, and they\r\nbelieved in perfect privacy. The punks were to encryption laws what the\r\nNational Rifle Association was to restrictions on firearms.\r\n\r\nAlong with scores of corporations, not just people whom the White House\r\nmight dismiss as fringe, the Cypherpunks wanted to use encryption to\r\nprotect digital money. They envisioned a society in which bits and\r\nbytes—representing cash—could pass from person to person without Party A\r\nknowing Party B’s identity. The Cypherpunks were smart, and often very\r\nright. Frustrating for others, but rewarding for them, they tested the\r\ntolerance of the most ardent Voltaireans.\r\n\r\nTim May was among the punk leaders. He had once worked for Intel, the\r\nchip maker. As Steven Levy put it in an article for _Wired_, May had\r\n“‘retired’ at 34 with stock options sufficient to assure that he would\r\nnever flip a burger for Wendy’s.” He in some ways came across as the\r\nInternet’s Abbie Hoffman, say, or Jerry Rubin. Baby boomers will forever\r\nrecall these bearded crazies of the 1960s who ran a pig for president\r\nand protested materialism by going to Wall Street and scattering money\r\naround.\r\n\r\nMay did not mind getting rich. But he had something of his own to\r\nscatter in cyberspace. It was a series of taunts that appeared at the\r\nbottom of the many messages he posted to the Net: “Crypto Anarchy:\r\nencryption, digital money, anonymous networks, digital pseudonyms, zero\r\nknowledge, reputations, information markets, black markets, collapse of\r\ngovernments.” If Washington had rigged up a machine to scan the Net and\r\nmeasure people by levels of subversion, May would have blown out all the\r\nlights and needles. And one of his programs of choice, as advertised\r\namid the other subversion? PGP, what else?\r\n\r\nTimothy May and other Cypherpunks over the next few years would tap out\r\nthousands of messages, exchanging technical tips, dreaming up new forms\r\nof crypto madness, rallying support for encryption and for Phil\r\nZimmermann. This was a whole subculture with a language and an ethics\r\ncode of its own. Sometimes the Cypherpunks fought among themselves.\r\nLater a punk in Colorado “spoofed” Timothy May and, using May’s Internet\r\naddress, posted malarkey all over the Net. But true to his anarchistic\r\nleanings, May did not press for the dissident’s expulsion from the punk\r\nmailing list.\r\n\r\nBack in November 1992 the punks may have breathed a little easier.\r\nGeorge Bush lost the election. No longer would the president be a\r\nRepublican, a World War II veteran, and a former director of the Central\r\nIntelligence Agency. Bill Clinton was a baby boomer. He had spoken out\r\nagainst Vietnam, he had avoided the draft, he liked Fleetwood Mac, he\r\nplayed a saxophone, and his vice presidential candidate had made a name\r\nas a loyal supporter of advanced computer networks. So perhaps the Feds\r\nwould back off on Zimmermann. At the very least maybe the security\r\nbureaucracy would face a long delay while the Clinton people puzzled out\r\nwhat to do.\r\n\r\nClinton’s sax and the rest did not count, however; in encryption matters\r\nhe might as well have been a ninety-nine-year-old fan of Lawrence Welk.\r\nWithin just a few weeks of the inauguration, two men from the U.S.\r\nCustoms Department were quizzing Phil Zimmermann. According to the book\r\n_PGP: Pretty Good Privacy_, they said Jim Bidzos had described PGP as a\r\nrip-off of the RSA approach.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Zimmermann interview, Customs pressed ahead both on the\r\npatent front and on export law issues. Zimmermann, however, denied\r\nhaving swiped PGP from anyone, and he said patent matters should be\r\nbetween him and Bidzos, not between him and Customs. At the time the\r\nFeds told him he was not the target of an investigation.[6.20]\r\n\r\nSoon, however, two subpoenas suggested that Washington was still quite\r\neager to justify any and all of the Cypherpunk’s paranoia.\r\n\r\nOne subpoena went to Austin Code Works, which sold public-domain\r\nsoftware that contained some of Zimmermann’s work. Washington struck\r\nout. It had been seeking evidence of overseas sales, and Austin lacked\r\nany in this case. Zimmermann hadn’t even sold Austin his work\r\ndirectly.[6.21]\r\n\r\nWashington was more lucky at ViaCrypt, a company in Arizona, where the\r\nsubpoena stuck. Zimmermann had just given ViaCrypt a PGP license. Now he\r\nindeed would be under investigation. In _PGP: Pretty Good Privacy_,\r\nSimson Garfinkel observed that RSA Data did not win similar honors even\r\nthough it had placed encryption-related software on the Internet. Nor\r\ndid Internet providers such as Netcom, which stored PGP on computers\r\nthat people overseas could reach.[6.22] Bill Clinton’s people were\r\nletting foreigners dial up this export-controlled software again and\r\nagain. Needless to say, the bullying of Zimmermann still made the\r\nindustry nervous—who was next?\r\n\r\nAs if the Clinton White House hadn’t sinned enough, it was about to\r\nembarrass itself in a high-tech version of the Bay of Pigs. That’s how\r\ncritics regarded a nitwit scheme to control encryption and discourage\r\nthe public from using good software such as PGP. The Bay of Pigs, a\r\ncuckoo plan for the invasion for Cuba, was a legacy that had come to\r\nJohn F. Kennedy from the Eisenhower Administration. The odds would have\r\ndelighted no one but a masochistic squad of kamikaze pilots. Castro\r\ncrushed a small band of Cuban exiles who showed up on Washington’s\r\nbehalf at the Bay of Pigs. Like the debacle on the Cuban beaches, the\r\nClipper chip was really another Republican leftover. The national\r\nsecurity apparatus hadn’t been able to con the Bush Administration into\r\nimplementing Clipper before the election. But Bill Clinton himself\r\nlacked the guts to resist the NSA.\r\n\r\n“No Such Agency,” as Washington wags called it, operated out of Fort\r\nMeade, Maryland, near the Chesapeake Bay, perhaps explaining its\r\nfondness for assigning nautical names to encryption plans. Many billions\r\nof tax money had gone into the NSA over the years. Thousands worked for\r\nit. And they weren’t just interested in the survival of the United\r\nStates. They wanted job security. Clipper was going to be a meal ticket.\r\nJust as some wishful planners had deluded themselves into thinking that\r\na small band of men could tame Cuba, now the NSA was telling Bill\r\nClinton’s people that it could use Clipper to control the world of\r\nencryption.\r\n\r\nAll those irksome constitutional details aside, the NSA’s plan might\r\nactually have made sense once. The people at Fort Meade had done the\r\nUnited States a service by staying ahead of Soviet encryption in the era\r\nof tail fins and air raid drills. But today such an approach was about\r\nas appropriate as a backyard bomb shelter. As far back as the 1970s, two\r\nmen outside NSA’s control had invented public key encryption, which, as\r\nnoted before, was a good way for strangers to exchange secure messages\r\nand authenticate their identities from the start. Whitfield Diffie was a\r\nmathematician, computer scientist, and encryption expert. Martin Hellman\r\nwas an electronic engineer. Both were grouchy about a computer system\r\nwhose users had to entrust their passwords to the systems managers. So\r\nthey came up with public key encryption—the same principle that was\r\nbehind the RSA approach used in PGP, and now available from Boston to\r\nBrisbane.\r\n\r\nEven Bill Clinton couldn’t repeal the past. Just as the Kennedy\r\nAdministration had justified Castro’s paranoia, so the Clinton\r\nAdministration worked hard to do the same with that of the Cypherpunks.\r\nThis time Washington wouldn’t deploy humans. Instead it wanted to rely\r\non a little computer chip that Steven Levy described as “just another\r\ntiny square of plastic covering a silicon thicket.”\r\n\r\n“Tumor-sized” might have been more apropos. Clipper, in fact, was a\r\ntumor of sorts.\r\n\r\nIn a human body a tumor serves itself, not its host. And that’s what\r\nClipper was supposed to do. The Clinton Administration wanted to license\r\nClipper to the private sector, where it would show up in millions of\r\ntelephones and dominate the market—displacing future encryption schemes\r\nbased on technologies such as PGP. Washington hoped to make Clipper too\r\ncheap to resist and to provide a federal market for Clipper products.\r\nAT&T and the rest could put Clipper in telephones, and then, supposedly,\r\ndope peddlers couldn’t peddle and terrorists couldn’t terrorize without\r\nthe Feds having a chance to intercept their conversations. The\r\ngovernment would also work to make computers snoop friendly.\r\n\r\nThat was the scenario. Like tumors these government-issue chips were to\r\nspread—not only in the States but also overseas. Eventually the Feds\r\nwould also announce plans to make Clipper available through software,\r\nrather than just through the chip. Whatever the incarnation of Clipper,\r\nthough, Washington would play down the fact that it would corrode the\r\ncountry’s constitutional right to privacy. America’s Winston Smiths\r\nwould have to trust a government that had covered up an unhealthy number\r\nof deaths from nuclear fallout, given us Watergate, and illegally spied\r\non thousands of Americans.\r\n\r\nAn old friend of mine, Margaret “Peggy” Engel, a former _Washington\r\nPost_ reporter who ran and still runs a respected journalism foundation,\r\nwas among the snoops’ victims. Bureaucrats got the phone company to turn\r\nover a list of Peggy’s calls even though she had not committed a crime.\r\nIt seems a freelance writer had managed to dig up some inside\r\ninformation on the failure of the IRS to collect several billion dollars\r\nin back taxes from corporations that had profited from currency hedging.\r\nThis same writer later applied for a grant from Engel’s organization,\r\nthe Alicia Patterson Foundation. Vindictively, the Feds snooped on\r\nEngel, too, simply because the writer had made a call to Engel’s office\r\nfor an application for a fellowship.\r\n\r\nSo it went. Because Peggy and I talked from time to time, the Feds had\r\nalso tracked her telephone and computer calls to me. They acted against\r\nher under a casually issued court order signed not by a judge but by an\r\nassistant deputy clerk—one of more than 20,000 such actions issued in\r\nthe Washington area in 1992. “It’s like getting your parking ticket\r\nstamped,” she told me. “That’s the level of scrutiny that these things\r\nget. And the number keeps growing. I think it’s because of the increase\r\nin fax machines. I think agencies are using it on their employees to\r\nfind out who talked to the press or Congress.” And now the Feds wanted\r\nto license the manufacture of a chip that would spill our secrets on\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nGranted, the Feds claimed that in the Clipper’s case, one bureaucrat\r\ncould not spy alone. The official line was that people from both the\r\nTreasury Department and the National Institute for Standards and\r\nTechnology would have to agree before an interception could take place.\r\nIf they did, the electronic keys would go over the wires to local police\r\nor others needing the tap. All this would require a court order. Some\r\nClipper boosters might well have argued, “We’re talking about strict\r\ncontrols.” But Peggy’s experience still showed the potential the Feds\r\nhad for promiscuous Big Brothering, especially since both the Treasury\r\nand the Institute were within the Executive Branch.\r\n\r\nLater the front pages would sprout articles about bureaucrats reading\r\nthe supposedly confidential tax information of their neighbors or of\r\nmovie stars. Yes, the tax people tightened up their operations to avoid\r\nrepeats. But supposedly the IRS had been secure in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe NSA might itself prove capable of some nasty twists. What if it\r\ncould call up escrow keys from a database despite all talk to the\r\ncontrary? Or suppose it had a database of its own to unlock all the\r\nkeys? Would it really want to go to court for authority to snoop? In\r\n_PGP: Pretty Good Privacy_, Garfinkel wisely noted that Washington would\r\nlet Clipper chips be exported. And the NSA was allowed to spy on\r\nnondomestic conversations. So he logically wrote: “If Clipper-equipped\r\nradios were being used by Iraqi fighter pilots, the NSA would want to\r\nlisten in. Although the NSA hasn’t said so publicly, it is doubtful that\r\nthe agency would jeopardize national security in order to play along\r\nwith the escrow system.” The NSA might even work out secret deals with\r\nthe company making the chips, to assure that the results didn’t\r\nfrustrate the snoops.\r\n\r\nAdding to the quite-justified paranoia was the fact that only the\r\ndumbest of criminals would rely on Clipper to protect privacy. So what\r\nwas the point of using technology meant to turn the bad guys into jail\r\nbait? Why bother to create it in the first place?\r\n\r\nWashington countered that criminals would want Clipper phones to talk\r\nsecurely to the world at large. And I suspected that, yes, they indeed\r\nwould buy some equipment with Clipper. But for plotting a $10 million\r\ndope shipment or a terrorist attack, the black hats would quickly learn\r\nto use other scrambling systems; in fact, they could run them on top of\r\nClipper so the Feds _still_ got only gibberish. Even if the Feds banned\r\nPGP-style protection, criminals would spread the right hardware and\r\nsoftware among themselves. Like drugs or sex, this would be a fine\r\nopportunity for entrepreneurial lawbreakers.\r\n\r\nThe underworld might even sell Clipper-crackers that could make\r\ncriminals just as good at snooping on America’s Winston Smiths as the\r\nFeds would be. High-tech hoods could call their new business Credit Card\r\nNumbers Unlimited. Small wonder that Clipper appalled many security\r\nspecialists.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, experts for the software industry raised questions\r\nabout whether the Clipper chip could penetrate the market and, if so, to\r\nwhat extent? Any way you looked at it, the plan was crazy. If Clipper\r\ncouldn’t catch criminals (and did _everyone_ in the White House really\r\nswallow this bilge?), then who was left? People like Peggy Engel, her\r\nmuckraking grantee, and me. At least part of the time, we would need\r\nClipperish encryption if somehow it surprised the experts and did catch\r\non; our banks might not let us use anything else. How much better if a\r\nPGP-style alternative were the standard instead.\r\n\r\nTechnically, Clipper was just as scary as it was politically and in\r\nlaw-enforcement terms. Scientists and mathematicians loved to dissect\r\nencryption schemes in academic papers, and keep checking and rechecking\r\nthem over the years for flaws. But Clipper’s designers withheld the\r\ninformation that outside experts could use to poke holes in the concept.\r\nUnknowns indeed existed. A well-connected scientist at AT&T would later\r\nfind a significant weakness in the network version of Clipper, a way to\r\ncripple the snoop-on-me-please feature.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Clipper actually emerged as a world security threat.\r\nWashington was harming electronic commerce by promoting a crippled and\r\nquestionable program for encryption. The Administration in effect was\r\ndelaying the adoption of truly comprehensive security standards for the\r\ninternational community, especially business people outside the States.\r\nThe standards were on the way, but not as fast as if Clinton’s people\r\nhadn’t wreaked havoc on the private sector by way of moronic export\r\ncontrols.\r\n\r\n“We need strong cryptography for mainstream society on the Net,”\r\nZimmermann told me. “It’s like making locks. It’s as if I were in the\r\nbusiness of selling very, very strong locks.” He reminded me of the case\r\nof Kevin Mitnick, who was arrested for breaking into scads of computers\r\nand stealing oceans of valuable information. The FBI chased him for a\r\ncouple of years. “Isn’t it ironic that this guy was able to inflict such\r\ndamage because our systems are so insecure?” Zimmermann asked. “Our own\r\ngovernment suppressed the availability of strong encryption technology.\r\nThey brought it on themselves, or, I should say more accurately, they\r\nbrought it down on us.”\r\n\r\nAt the same time, through Clipper and through efforts against PGP and\r\nother effective software, Washington in effect was lending moral support\r\nto dictatorships. Clipper used a technique called _key escrow_. That was\r\na nice way of saying you had to trust Uncle with your secrets since he\r\nhad a copy of your key. But what if Uncle weren’t Uncle Sam? What if he\r\ninstead were Uncle Saddam?\r\n\r\n“You may have the Saddam Husseins of the world, the North Koreans, being\r\nable to hang on to power,” Zimmermann said, “by using this technology to\r\noppress their own political opposition.”\r\n\r\nClipper could do harm even in countries friendly to the United States.\r\nWashington wanted them to adopt Clipper-style standards. And at the very\r\nleast the Clinton Administration was encouraging these governments to\r\ndemand the keys to whatever encryption schemes their citizens used. That\r\ncould boomerang mightily against American companies doing business\r\noutside the States. Phil Zimmermann recounted to me a rumor he’d heard\r\nabout a giant entertainment conglomerate that had negotiated a huge deal\r\nin France; its executives found the French to be uncannily prescient\r\nabout the Americans’ tactics. The espionage rumor might or might not be\r\naccurate. But fear of French spying against Yanks was common enough for\r\nmany people from U.S. firms to be very careful about what they said on\r\nthe telephone, or where they left their suitcases. The French had\r\nprohibited strong cryptography. And the Clipper plan, while not a ban on\r\ndecent encryption, certainly deprived American companies of the moral\r\nfoundations they needed to protest the French law. In the long run a\r\nClipper arrangement might indeed pave the way for a ban in the United\r\nStates itself against PGP-strength products, and already it could prop\r\nup such moves abroad, to the great disadvantage of American companies\r\nwith secrets to protect.\r\n\r\nIn another way, too, Clipperish approaches would make U.S. companies\r\nless competitive. American software firms wanted to build encryption\r\ninto spreadsheets, databases, word processors, and other major\r\napplications. If the Feds bullied them into using Clipper, then their\r\nproducts would be less attractive than those of rivals. Consider the\r\nmarket for software to store sensitive material such as medical records;\r\nwould a European hospital favor a crippled American program over a\r\nGerman program with robust encryption?\r\n\r\nThat wasn’t so abstract a question. An engineer from the giant Siemens\r\nconglomerate in Germany told me later that he was working on medical\r\nsoftware, and he expected his employer to clobber U.S. rivals if their\r\nproducts used a questionable, Clipperish encryption scheme. What’s more,\r\ncrypto mavens were common enough overseas for even American companies to\r\nthink about hiring them in the former Soviet Union to bypass the export\r\ncontrols. If it happened, it would be the ultimate statement on the\r\nabsurdity of both the controls and Clipper.\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, a great hue and cry against Clipper came from the\r\nAmerican software industry, and meanwhile the hackers themselves were\r\nwaging full-scale warfare against it on the Net. Thousands of Netfolks\r\nparticipated in the anti-Clipper activities of groups such as the\r\nComputer Professionals for Social Responsibility, the first group to\r\nsound the tocsin.\r\n\r\nIn 1994, however, as clueless as ever, the White House officially\r\nendorsed Clipper—no ifs ands or buts—and made arrangements for the\r\nproduction of the chips. “Encryption is a law-and-order issue since it\r\ncan be used by criminals to thwart wiretaps and avoid detection and\r\nprosecution,” Al Gore said in justifying Clipper. “It also has huge\r\nstrategic value. Encryption technology and cryptoanalysis turned the\r\ntide in the Pacific and elsewhere during World War II.” But exactly.\r\nPeople on the Net thought that Clipper was just plain brain-dead as a\r\nway to protect security, a triumph of bureaucrats over techies.\r\n\r\nYou even didn’t have to be on the Net to hate the tumor chip. At the\r\nrequest of _Time_ and CNN, Yankelovich Partners polled 1,000 Americans;\r\ndid they think that private phone calls mattered more than wiretap\r\npowers for police? Four-fifths opposed Clipper. Newspapers churned out\r\neditorial after editorial, and with good cause: Imagine the joys of\r\ntrying to expose government corruption if the biggest crooks on the\r\npublic payroll might someday be able to monitor your conversations\r\nwhenever they wanted.\r\n\r\nQuite properly, then, most citizens did not trust Washington. Hackers\r\nwore sweatshirts that played on a slogan that Intel used to promote\r\ncomputers using its chips. Alluding to Clipper, the sweatshirts read,\r\n“Big Brother Inside.” Tens of thousands of people on the Net lent their\r\nnames to an anti-Clipper petition originated by Computer Professionals\r\nfor Social Responsibility. John Perry Barlow, the Grateful Dead lyricist\r\nwho cofounded the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told how snoopy Feds\r\nwould have to kill him and pry his private PGP key from his “cold, dead\r\nfingers.” Through it all, meg after meg of messages went out over the\r\nNet—everything from sophomoric diatribes to carefully reasoned pleas for\r\nanti-Clipper letters to local members of Congress.\r\n\r\nAfter questioning some arguments against Clipper, one man found himself\r\nvilified all over the Net, complete with a lie that he had made a\r\nhomosexual advance against a hacker. The privacy movement was supposed\r\nto defend Americans’ right to dissent, not enforce its own form of\r\nalternative orthodoxy. I felt grumpy, then, about the smear. But that\r\nwas a relatively rare incident; typical opposition to Clipper was\r\npassionate but high minded.\r\n\r\nExcept for the smear described above, the meanest statements came not\r\nfrom Clipper foes but from Stewart A. Baker, a PGP critic who was about\r\nto return to private practice after serving as chief counsel for the\r\nNational Security Agency. _Wired_ commendably let Baker give his side.\r\nThe magazine did so “with all the enthusiasm,” Baker wrote, “of Baptist\r\nministers turning their Sunday pulpits over to the Devil.”\r\n\r\nUnderstandably Baker began by denying that Clipper would “create a brave\r\nnew world of government intrusion into the privacy of Americans.” Baker\r\nsaid that key escrow would merely maintain Washington’s rights to do\r\nwire-taps as presently authorized. That was a wrong; the government\r\nactually was going out of its way to make us all tap ready, as if we\r\nwere back in the old Soviet Union in the KGB era. But at least in this\r\ncase Baker wasn’t maligning the Net. The nastiness oozed out later when\r\nhis article took on “Myth Number Two: Unreadable encryption is the key\r\nto our future liberty.” Baker shrugged off such reasoning as “the\r\nlong-delayed revenge of people who couldn’t go to Woodstock because they\r\nhad too much trig homework. It reflects a wide—and kind of\r\nendearing—streak of romantic high-tech anarchism that crops up\r\nthroughout the computer world.” Then he let loose against PGP-style\r\nprograms itself. “Some argue that widespread availability of this\r\nencryption will help Latvian freedom fighters today and American freedom\r\nfighters tomorrow.” Presumably thousands of PGP boosters were hunkered\r\ndown making bombs in Manhattan basements.\r\n\r\nHaving tried to ignore the legitimate uses of PGP by thousands of\r\npeaceful, law-abiding citizens, Baker then told how “a high-tech\r\npedophile in Santa Clara, California, had a PGP-encrypted diary of his\r\ncontacts with susceptible young boys using computer bulletin boards all\r\nover the country.” Oh. So between overthrowing the government, PGP users\r\nwould be seducing eight-year-olds. Baker huffed that “if unescrowed\r\nencryption becomes ubiquitous, there will be many more stories like\r\nthis.”\r\n\r\nPoor Baker. If he’d really wanted to do his attacks right, he could have\r\nquoted with full grimness the writings that Timothy May, the Cypherpunk,\r\nhad posted on the Net in the spirit of Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman.\r\n\r\nMay was the author of a long, detailed, sometimes even Talmudic list of\r\nfrequently asked questions and answers on cryptography and the fight for\r\nprivacy, which might or might not have been on the Net at the time Baker\r\nwas writing his _Wired_ piece. But if not, he could have found\r\nequivalent thoughts among May’s many postings to the Cypherpunks’ rather\r\npublic list. Laying out the case against strong encryption programs in\r\nthe PGP vein, May conjectured that they could make killing for hire much\r\nmore practical. People using encryption could rely on trusted agents who\r\ndispensed anonymous digital cash. “There are some ways to reduce the\r\npopularity of this Murder Incorporated system,” May said, and kindly\r\nassured readers that he had been thinking about them.\r\n\r\nFor good measure May noted that racists such as the Aryan Nation were\r\nusing encryption, and “other kinds of terrorists” might be relying on it\r\nas well. “Expect more uses in the future, as things like PGP continue to\r\nspread.” As if that weren’t enough to pull bureaucrats’ chains, May\r\nsaid: “Many of us are explicitly anti-democratic and hope to use\r\nencryption to undermine the so-called democratic governments of the\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\nMay, ever the idea juggler, also weighed in with some powerful arguments\r\n_for_ PGP that appealed strongly to a stodgy old Democrat (small “d” as\r\nwell) like me. Even the Feds should have grasped them. “Could strong\r\ncrypto be used for sick and disgusting and dangerous purposes?” May\r\nasked. And then he answered himself: “So can locked doors, but we don’t\r\ninsist on an ‘open door policy’ (outside of certain quaint sorority and\r\nrooming houses!). So do many forms of privacy allow plotters, molesters,\r\nracists, etc., to meet and plot.” Whatever May was, anarchist,\r\nlibertarian, objectivist, or nothing, he was making more sense in those\r\nthree sentences than Baker could have in a 1,000 essays.\r\n\r\nAfter May signed up for Cyberia, a legally oriented list, he was one of\r\nthe favorite nonlawyers there, winning friends even among those who\r\ndisagreed with his politics. In one limited way he may have been more\r\nthreatening to Washington than Hoffman or Rubin, for, rather than just\r\nranting and raving and putting on a good show, he could communicate all\r\ntoo cogently with members of the establishment. At the same time the\r\nFeds were fixating on Zimmermann, May casually told the lawyers how he\r\nmoved in and out of the country without letting Washington veto his\r\nspeeches on encryption. In effect his gleeful confession made mockery of\r\nthe laws. If D.C. couldn’t even control a traveler—there in flesh and\r\nblood—how could it monitor electrons speeding over the phone wires?\r\n\r\n“I myself just presented a paper on ‘Crypto Anarchy and Virtual\r\nCommunities’ in Monte Carlo,” May told the cyberlawyers, at least one of\r\nwhom was an attorney from the Justice Department. “I described\r\nalgorithms, methods, etc., and was never asked or instructed to submit\r\nto the Men in Black in D.C.” He was even carrying around “several\r\ngigabytes of code, essays, programs.” But never was he “ever stopped,\r\nquestioned, or searched. Only upon landing in San Francisco was I asked\r\nto state my business overseas. I said I was meeting with cryptographers\r\nfrom around the world! This was met with confusion by the\r\ntwenty-two-year-old Customs officer; but after asking if any of them\r\nwere from Russia or Iraq, and I told him I had no idea if there were or\r\nnot, he waved me through.” May said most U.S. cryptographers “just shrug\r\nand ignore the _possibility_ that our papers may be illegal to present\r\noutside the U.S.”\r\n\r\nHis observations came as the Electronic Frontier Foundation was trying\r\nto resolve matters in a more tidy way. It was sponsoring a lawsuit to\r\nprevent Washington from restricting the spread of encryption-related\r\nwriting and software. Quite correctly the EFF argued that the encryption\r\nlaws were an “impermissible prior restraint on speech, in violation of\r\nthe First Amendment.” An EFF victory, needless to say, could nuke the\r\ngovernment’s case against Zimmermann.\r\n\r\nWith Hooverian tenacity, as if Phil Zimmermann were Dillinger or a\r\ngodfather, Washington kept up its harassment and even escalated it in\r\nsome ways. Jim Warren saw this happen firsthand. He had asked to testify\r\nseveral years ago in Zimmermann’s defense, but the authorities ignored\r\nhis request. Then in 1995 he had published op-ed pieces in San Jose and\r\nSan Francisco papers, in which he throttled the FBI and NSA for getting\r\nin the way of the best possible security on the Net. In the wake of the\r\nMitnick break-ins, he had accused the Feds of “endangering millions of\r\ninnocent citizens and law-abiding businesses that use the Net or cell\r\nphones, in order to protect their ability to monitor the few who might\r\nbe guilty of something.” Almost immediately two U.S. Customs agents\r\nfavored Warren with a surprise visit to his house and quizzed him about\r\nZimmermann and PGP. “When they began the interview,” he said, “they\r\nhanded me a subpoena that said I was ‘COMMANDED to appear and testify\r\nbefore the Grand Jury of the United States District Court’ in San\r\nJose.“[6.23]\r\n\r\n“Who says government isn’t responsive,” Warren quipped.\r\n\r\nHe said this in a folksy newsletter sent to hundreds of people on the\r\nNet. Its well-earned name was _Government Access_; he had been the main\r\norganizer of a successful campaign to get California to put legislative\r\ninformation on the Internet for free. As much as anyone he was trying to\r\nwork within The System. Yet he was ever skeptical toward “Congress\r\nCritters.” Again and again Warren’s newsletter in effect depicted a\r\nWashington that could be Torylike in its contempt toward Netfolk.\r\n\r\nWarren didn’t just write of the well-publicized threats like the Exon\r\nbill, or the Clinton Administration’s prosecution of a couple in\r\nCalifornia because their sex-oriented BBS did not come up to Bible Belt\r\ncommunity standards in Tennessee, or the Zimmermann case itself. Warren\r\nalso wrote of obscure people such as a Berkeley-area hacker who, enraged\r\nby restrictions on encryption and by other actions in the vein of King\r\nGeorge’s Stamp Act, had fled to Sweden.\r\n\r\n“Sweden is no paradise,” the expatriate told Warren via e-mail, “but I\r\ndon’t ever worry that the government is going to break into my home. I\r\nknow that I’ll be able to run my BBS, maintain all the contacts I’ve\r\ndeveloped over the years, and continue to use the various nets without\r\nfear of Uncle Sam attacking me. So now I’m trading in my U.S. passport\r\nfor one that is a lot less threatening to me and my PC.” Warren added:\r\n“This is the second former American I have known who has done this for\r\nexactly these reasons!” I remembered a hacker libertarian who had been\r\nhoping to construct an island in the Caribbean, beyond the reach of\r\ntechnophobic politicians.\r\n\r\nWarren was disappointed enough with Washington to tell the Net: “I’m\r\nbeginning to feel like a German Jew in 1935.” He didn’t just hate\r\nClipper and the harassment of Zimmermann. On top of everything else,\r\nWashington had recently passed a digital telephone bill that “would make\r\nLyndon Johnson, Nixon’s Watergate team, and J. Edgar Hoover drool on\r\ntheir bibs.” The project would cost the taxpayers billions of dollars\r\nover the years—all this to make the phone system more tappable, out of\r\nfear that crooks might otherwise forward phone calls to bugfree\r\nlocations. Washington was actually setting aside more money for snooping\r\nthan for electronic libraries. And now Warren feared that the Feds\r\nsomeday would ban encryption outright.\r\n\r\nBeyond D.C.’s computer-related stupidities, he loathed the way the Feds\r\nplayed fast and easy with the Constitution on matters such as drug law\r\nenforcement. Agencies, for example, could keep money and equipment taken\r\nfrom suspects and use them for their own purposes, thus giving police “a\r\nprofit motive” to abuse Americans’ rights.\r\n\r\n“No doubt,” Warren said, “many in Germany told that nation’s Jews, ‘It’s\r\nnot that serious’ and ‘It’s just a phase—it’ll pass’ as they disarmed\r\nthe citizens in the name of law and order only a few years before\r\nfilling the camps and ovens that somehow good, law-abiding Germans just\r\nnever knew about until after the war. If we don’t watch out, our\r\ngovernment’s cure for ‘crime’ will become even more dangerous than the\r\nillness. And this time, I don’t think Sweden will be a safe haven.”\r\n\r\nClearly Warren was a long, long way from the optimism of _Orwell’s\r\nRevenge_, the book in which Big Brother lost to the hackers.\r\n\r\nI doubted that the United States was quite as Oceania-like as Jim Warren\r\nobviously believed, and his own German parallel might be stretching it.\r\nStamp Act parallels did, however, fit. An old, ignorant, Torylike order\r\nwanted to pass laws to contain the new, and I could envision an\r\nincreasing number of ugly confrontations between bureaucrats and\r\nNetfolk. Baker, the ex-NSA man, hadn’t hesitated in the least to come up\r\nwith his wacky characterizations of Clipper foes. To the D.C. policy\r\nelite, we on the Net were fair pickings.\r\n\r\nAll the hype about the Information Superhighway notwithstanding, most of\r\nthe Feds didn’t feel quite as at home on computer networks as billed.\r\nMost Congress members in mid-1995 still lacked public e-mail addresses.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Net was catching on among millions of younger Americans\r\nwho surfed freely, while their elders could barely master commercial\r\nnetworks such as CompuServe. By way of Clipper and blatantly\r\nanti-network copyright proposals, the White House was kissing off all\r\ntoo many within Generation Net.[6.24]\r\n\r\nA further embarrassment was the contrasting enlightenment of some\r\nRepublican conservatives, who many Democrats on the Net might have\r\ndismissed entirely in the past. Rush Limbaugh, the right-wing talk show\r\nhost, didn’t just show up on CompuServe as a visitor. He personally\r\nlogged on again and again and even met his wife there. He might not be\r\non the Net itself, but he was much more at ease with the technology than\r\nwere the majority of the liberals on the Hill. Meanwhile, the most\r\npowerful conservative of all, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, spoke out\r\nagainst the Exon amendment. William Buckley, the noted conservative\r\njournalist, was a major backer of my proposal for a decentralized\r\nnational library system online. And the conservative writer George\r\nGilder, while all too zealous at times about free markets, had made some\r\nof the most prescient predictions on the direction in which the\r\ntechnology was headed.\r\n\r\nToo many Democrats were TV-centric, while Gilder believed that computers\r\nwould be the new entertainment medium, prevailing over television. Sales\r\nfigures proved him right. More Americans bought desktops computers in\r\n1994 than purchased color televisions, and it was only a matter of time\r\nuntil they logged onto computer networks and worried about their privacy\r\nthere. And here were Clinton and Gore pushing Clipper with more ardor\r\nthan they could summon up for well-stocked electronic libraries for all.\r\n\r\nOf course, not everybody on the Democratic side was hopeless, and many\r\nRepublican law-and-order types loved Clipper, the Bush leftover. Also,\r\nthese same politicians might well applaud the Clinton Administration’s\r\nanti-Net copyright proposals, not understanding all the undertows that\r\ncould ultimately drag property rights under. But at least they hadn’t\r\nenlisted civil libertarians and populists in their campaigns to the\r\nextent that Bill Clinton had. I’d never have voted for the man if I’d\r\nknown in advance about Clipper, the harassment of Zimmermann, and the\r\nantediluvian copyright policies. Bush in some ways might have been\r\npreferable. Not knowing the difference between a potato chip and a\r\nsilicon chip, he would have done much less damage. A smarter, more\r\nprincipled Democrat than Clinton could pick up the pieces in ’96.\r\n\r\nClinton’s Justice Department showed a brazen and bizarre lack of\r\nfairness toward Zimmermann. Until the statute of limitations expired—and\r\nthat was fuzzy, even to lawyers—the Feds might just let him dangle.\r\nWithout finding Zimmermann guilty of anything, or even charging him,\r\nWashington in a sense was already leveling penalties. He had to spend\r\nhours and hours away from his regular consulting business to work on his\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nTotal costs might reach $300,000 if the prosecutors decided to act. Even\r\nif lawyers donated their time—and Zimmermann might enjoy the services of\r\nsome noted attorneys outraged by the threat to civil liberties—there\r\nwould be the burden of telephone costs, travel, and hotels. Appeals for\r\ndonations went up in such areas of the Usenet as talk.crypto.politics,\r\ncomp.org.eff.talk, and, of course, alt.security.pgp. People could pay by\r\ncredit card, encoding their numbers via PGP.[6.25]\r\n\r\nIn the end, no matter what happened to Zimmermann, the real victory\r\nmight be in the marketplace. And there Clipper was losing. AT&T and a\r\nchip maker named VLSI Technology came out with a chip that would\r\nchallenge even the NSA’s supercomputer. Given a choice between that and\r\nClipper, who’d want the latter? Even before then, in fact, few customers\r\nwere going for Clipper-based equipment.[6.26] In the end it looked as if\r\nWashington would resort not to a chip but to continued pressure on U.S.\r\ncorporations to make available the key schemes of more secure plans. And\r\neven then, I hoped, the industry would balk. The more such foolishness\r\nbecame a habit here, the less protected would be American companies\r\nabroad, as people outside the States followed Washington’s example.\r\n\r\nSome of the biggest Clipper haters, meanwhile, were overlooking their\r\ndifferences to unite against the tumor chip. Jim Bidzos’ company had\r\nalready granted a license for the basic technology to ViaCrypt, which,\r\nat least in the latter’s opinion, left it free to sell a commercial\r\nversion of PGP. And this past action may have been a door opener in a\r\nway for Phil Zimmermann. PGP was no longer so much of an outlaw program\r\nin the eyes of many, and businesses felt they could use it and get\r\ntechnical support. Beyond that, professors at the Massachusetts\r\nInstitute of Technology, whence much of the RSA technology had come,\r\nwere sick of all the patent wars. They just wanted to see solid\r\nencryption in use. And Bidzos, however much he quarreled with\r\nZimmermann, was himself determined that the Feds not control encryption.\r\nThe compromise could go a long way toward enshrining RSA as at least an\r\ninformal world standard, and thwarting RSA’s biggest competitor, the\r\nNSA.\r\n\r\nAnd so Bizdos and colleagues let PGP be used for noncommercial purposes\r\nas long as the newer versions were incompatible with the older ones that\r\nlacked the blessing of RSA and Public Key Partners. Of course that still\r\ndidn’t solve the hassles of securing international commerce with a truly\r\nstrong encryption standard with which the U.S. government felt\r\ncomfortable. But even if PGP-style products weren’t official, they were\r\nmurdering Clipperish schemes before snoop-ready chips and programs could\r\ntake root. The world’s governments might well have to join countries\r\nlike France and try to ban strong encryption.\r\n\r\nBut could they? Too many people in too many countries were already using\r\nsoftware such as PGP. Hackers proudly included their public PGP\r\nkeys—those weird combinations of letters and numbers—at the ends of\r\ntheir messages or told how people could obtain them. PGP keys were\r\nbecoming status symbols. PGP wasn’t yet built into popular e-mail\r\nprograms such as Eudora for easy use, so, if nothing else, the keys\r\nindicated a certain level of technical expertise. They were the new\r\nvanity plates of the dataways. PGP was even becoming a small industry;\r\nfor example, you could shell out $20 and officially register your key\r\nwith a company in Palo Alto, California, called SLED. And then people\r\nreceiving messages from you would know they were really from you.\r\n\r\nSLED required a mailed or faxed driver’s license or passport, or a\r\npreprinted personal check. This wasn’t the best proof of identity, but\r\nit would at least let Netfolks spot obvious forgeries immediately. If\r\nnothing else, you could “register” your key with friends who were well\r\nknown and well trusted on the net.\r\n\r\nWith or without formal registration, more and more Netfolks felt lost\r\nwithout their PGP. Father Bill Morton, the Anglican priest mentioned\r\nearlier, the one who used PGP to accept confessions over the Net, wrote\r\na parody:\r\n\r\n               _It’s one for the money,\r\n               Two for the show,\r\n               Three to get ready,\r\n               Now go, cat, go!\r\n               But don’t you step on my PGP.\r\n               You can do anything, but lay off my PGP_.\r\n\r\nResponding to a query I’d posted in several encryption-related\r\nnewsgroups, he explained in an e-mail why PGP meant so much to him.\r\nConfessions were just part of the story:\r\n\r\n    _In the history of Anglican pastoral care, there is a strong\r\n    tradition of the use of the letter as a means of spiritual\r\n    guidance. Actually this tradition goes deep into the roots of\r\n    the Catholic Church. Some of the books regarded as “spiritual\r\n    classics” are compilations of correspondence between a person\r\n    and their spiritual director. Until the advent of PGP, e-mail\r\n    was not a suitable place for such correspondence. It’s one thing\r\n    to have your correspondence published 100 years after the fact;\r\n    it’s quite another to run the risk of having your personal\r\n    thoughts posted to a Usenet newsgroup or read by the sysop of a\r\n    BBS. Now they know that even if they hit the wrong button and\r\n    send their e-mail to the wrong place, it is secure....\r\n    Legislation that would make encryption illegal or require a\r\n    mandatory backdoor would totally compromise any trust in e-mail\r\n    or any other form of electronic text system such as word\r\n    processors._\r\n\r\nFather Morton’s respect for privacy came through when I asked for\r\nexamples of confidences that people had shared with him by way of PGP:\r\n“No matter how I disguise the facts,” he told me, “even if I were to\r\ncreate a fictitious person, someone somewhere would believe that they\r\nwere reading the details of their life story.” And so he was vague,\r\nother than to say, to give an idea of the gravity of what he heard,\r\n“Thoughts, dreams, hopes, as well as lust, anger, and hatred. Sometimes,\r\nactually oftentimes, there are things that you wouldn’t even tell your\r\nspouse. Our lives are based on trust.”\r\n\r\nThanks to PGP, Father Morton could maintain that trust not only with\r\npeople locally in Woodstock, New Brunswick, but with Netfolk from\r\nthousands of miles away.\r\n\r\nSome people met him in newsgroups. “We’ll have an exchange of e-mail on\r\na specific topic,” he said, “and at one point it will become evident\r\nthat I am a priest.” He neither hid nor played up his occupation. Upon\r\nlearning it, he said, the Netter at the other end “may wish to change\r\nthe topic and enter into a brief correspondence about a particular\r\nquestion. That conversation might last one or two posts and is usually,\r\nthough not always, in PGP.” In addition, he corresponded with a very\r\nsmall group of people regularly about significant events in their lives.\r\nThese conversations were always in PGP.\r\n\r\n“Before PGP,” Father Morton said, “e-mail was guarded in its content. A\r\ntypical e-mail exchange might be to set up a phone conversation or\r\nmeeting or discuss issues in very general terms. Now, at least in a few\r\ncases, the PGP mail is much more open in its content, and as a result\r\nthe e-mail pastoral relationship can be much more productive.”\r\n\r\nFather Morton was not alone in his use of PGP to protect personal\r\nsecrets. For example, the Samaritans, a group devoted to talking people\r\nout of suicide, said it would accept PGP-encrypted messages.\r\n\r\n“The Samaritans,” announced a Usenet post, “have always taken the\r\nconfidentiality of callers extremely seriously. Indeed the most\r\nfrequently asked question within the movement about our e-mail service\r\nis, ‘What about confidentiality?’” Surely, in an era when more and more\r\ncommunications happened to be electronic, it would be folly to deny\r\nreliable encryption to the Samaritans and the people they helped.\r\nAlthough the Samaritans felt more confidence about the security of\r\nunprotected e-mail than did Father Morton, they understood an important\r\ntruth: _perceptions_ mattered as much as anything. If their\r\ncorrespondents lacked faith in the confidentiality of e-mail, they\r\ncouldn’t write as freely. And, as I saw it, they might not be as open to\r\nrescue. If Washington banned PGP, if it replaced it with an inferior,\r\nClipperish arrangement, the Samaritans just might not be as successful\r\nas with truly secure encryption.\r\n\r\nPrivacy wasn’t just for confessions and for suicide prevention. It was\r\nalso for teenagers. Donna—she supplied her real name but I’ll protect\r\nher with a pseudonym—lived in Florida and was a seventeen-year-old\r\njunior in high school who was already using PGP. She e-mailed me:\r\n\r\n    _I couldn’t speak for other teenagers and their parents, but\r\n    with my extremely intrusive mother, I use all the privacy\r\n    devices I can get. I’ve kept extensive journals since second\r\n    grade—she’s always read them and nosed around, no matter where\r\n    I’ve tried to hide them. She’s opened letters from friends and\r\n    pokes her nose into anything that she considers unorthodox; we\r\n    don’t quite see eye to eye on many issues. I’m a good student,\r\n    responsible, don’t drink or do drugs, blah blah blah, but she\r\n    has continuously invaded my privacy over the years despite her\r\n    lack of justification._\r\n\r\n    _Two years ago I tried a locked drawer where I kept all of my\r\n    papers, letters, and the like, but she has opened the drawer\r\n    with my keys. So now I just do everything on the computer and\r\n    encrypt/password it. I can see how some parents might justify\r\n    searching their kids’ rooms—just as police can under\r\n    circumstances justify searching homes._\r\n\r\nBut, Donna went on, if a child were doing something _illegal_, there\r\n“would be physical evidence.” That seemed clear: You could encrypt a\r\ndiary full of unorthodox musings; you could not encode a marijuana\r\nstash.\r\n\r\nI would have trusted Donna, but I still had mixed feelings about most\r\nteenagers using PGP without their parents’ sharing the keys. How long\r\nuntil Senator Exon ranted that the young would encrypt dirty bytes? In\r\nthe end, however, just as with children’s use of the Net itself, PGP\r\nshould be a family decision, not a federal one; Washington mustn’t turn\r\ninto a giant version of Donna’s mother. Risks from a ban, even one\r\nlimited to children, so outweighed the benefits. If Donna’s mother\r\nwanted to understand her daughter, then maybe she needed to spend less\r\ntime doing a domestic-level KGB act and more time at a computer—seeing\r\nfor herself what her daughter was up to. In the process she might\r\nunderstand Donna well enough to tolerate her opinions. She’d better\r\nlearn to brook them; her daughter was almost eighteen, the age of\r\nadulthood in the United States. Soon many parents would be more\r\ncomfortable with the technology, and then, family by family, parents\r\ncould decide whether to be Big Mama or Big Daddy and look for\r\nPGP-encrypted files. It should be a family, not a government, matter.\r\n\r\nIf nothing else, parents themselves could use PGP to guard their own\r\nprivacy. “I use PGP at home solely for keeping confidential information\r\nfrom prying eyes—for instance, from my son and my son’s friends, as well\r\nas for keeping their information in one central place,” said Joe\r\nCollins, an employee of an international investment bank based in New\r\nYork. It guarded his burglar alarm codes, the codes to the family safe,\r\nall credit card numbers, and all passwords to software on the family\r\ncomputer. Yes, some popular software came with encryption, and certain\r\npeople might have argued that home users such as Collins didn’t need\r\nPGP. But the encryption found in popular software was nowhere near in\r\nPGP’s league. In fact, Crak Software, a company in Phoenix, Arizona,\r\neven sold “password-recovery software” to crack popular programs such as\r\nWordPerfect, Word, Excel, Lotus 1-2-3, and Quattro Pro (for backup\r\npurposes).\r\n\r\nAIDS activists especially understood the possibilities of good, strong\r\nencryption; victims of the disease, after all, were treated about as\r\nfairly as lepers had been in biblical times. In New York a group called\r\nACT UP tried to get the public health officials to encourage labs to use\r\nPGP to protect the identities of patients. The officials liked the idea.\r\nThe program died at the hands of a parsimonious governor; but sooner or\r\nlater, I suspected, PGP would be used in one way or another to protect\r\nthe privacy of AIDS patients, if it wasn’t already.\r\n\r\nIn the business area, the advantages of keeping PGP legal—and avoiding\r\nClipperish solutions—were just as clear as at the personal level. “PGP\r\nis essential,” said Robert David Steele, a former CIA agent whose\r\npassion for legalized encryption and dislike of Clipper must have\r\nendeared him to many hackers.[6.27] “Security is the foundation for\r\nopenness. In order for a world of open electronic exchanges actually to\r\nsucceed, electronic persons have to know three things, all of which PGP\r\nsupports: (a) that the person on the other end of the link is who he\r\nsays he is, (b) that the information being received is genuine and not\r\naltered, and (c) that a digital cash payment will be forthcoming,\r\nassuming that this is part of the transaction.” Steele was not just\r\ntalking about the benefits of PGP for business alone, but clearly it was\r\namong the major uses that he quite properly had on his mind here.\r\n\r\nMany business people on the Net agreed. I was hardly surprised to read\r\nin the _New York Times_ about the use of PGP “in what was apparently the\r\nfirst retail transactions on the Internet using a readily available\r\nversion of powerful data encryption software designed to guarantee\r\nprivacy.” A Philadelphia man had used PGP to scramble his credit card\r\nnumber and spent $12.48 and shipping costs on a compact disk with rock\r\nmusic from a New Hampshire company called Net Market. More benefits were\r\nto come. Already other companies were working on digital cash, which\r\ncould let bits and bytes go out over the Net in ways that prevented them\r\nfrom being easily traced. They would be, in other words, just like\r\ndollar bills.[6.28] You could spend them without Big Brother knowing\r\nthat you’d bought a _Playboy_, a Rush Limbaugh book, a condom, or\r\nwhatever else might somehow cause your neighbors or your boss to take\r\noffense.\r\n\r\nPGP also made sense for privacy protection _within_ companies. An\r\naccounting firm in Palo Alto, California, for example, used PGP to guard\r\nbackup tapes in case of loss or theft, and a Washington accountant\r\nrelied on it for client communications.[6.29] And when Zimmermann\r\nhimself asked online for PGP testimonials, a man with a\r\ntelecommunications firm on the West Coast told him how much he loved it\r\nas an alternative to Clipper:\r\n\r\n    _Once it becomes a standard, the competitive software industry\r\n    will have no incentive to continue technical development in\r\n    crypto. And then once Clipper gets cracked by outsiders or\r\n    otherwise compromised, there will still be a lot of bureaucratic\r\n    inertia protecting it and keeping the fact that it’s been\r\n    compromised a secret._\r\n\r\n    _We see a serious need for crypto to protect client records\r\n    regarding their telephone systems and computer networks, to\r\n    protect our internal company memos sent via e-mail, and to\r\n    protect strategic business information sent via e-mail. We\r\n    figure that a misrouted piece of client data is a potentially\r\n    serious liability issue, and a misrouted sales proposal or\r\n    similar business document is like leaving a credit card on a\r\n    park bench. Due diligence, fiscal responsibility, and all that.\r\n    The big plus is simply that we will be able to confidently move\r\n    a lot more of our business online, which will make a huge\r\n    difference to us. More efficient handling of client requests,\r\n    more efficient internal discussions, and more effective\r\n    communication with investors. In particular I do a lot of\r\n    strategic business planning online, and it always bugs me in the\r\n    back of my mind—‘What happens if this gets lost on the\r\n    Internet?’ In one sense good crypto is like a good business\r\n    dinner. It facilitates the flow of ideas in a relaxed\r\n    atmosphere._\r\n\r\nAt the same time, needless to say, PGP could improve the flow of\r\n_political_ ideas. In 1993 Boris Yeltsin had been at odds with foes\r\nnostalgic for the old Soviet state. “If a dictatorship takes over\r\nRussia,” a message from Latvia had told Zimmermann, “your PGP is\r\nwidespread from the Baltic to the Far East now and will help democratic\r\npeople if necessary. Thanks.”[6.30] In Burma rebels used PGP against an\r\noppressive regime. A writer in Thailand said that before PGP reached\r\nthem, captured papers had “resulted directly in arrest, including whole\r\nfamilies, and their torture and death.” Activists in El Salvador and\r\nGuatemala also relied on the program. “In this business, lots of people\r\nhave been killed,” said Daniel Salcedo, a member of the Human Rights\r\nProject of the American Association for the Advancement of\r\nScience.[6.31] David Banisar of the Electronic Privacy Information\r\nCenter told me of PGP being used in Kenya, Mali, Senegal, Egypt, and\r\nMali, among other countries.\r\n\r\n“Wire tapping is conducted in nearly every country in the world,”\r\nBanisar wrote in a paper with the marvelous title of “Bug Off!” “It is\r\nfrequently abused.” A 1992 State Department report, for example, told of\r\ngovernments and private organizations snooping away in dozens of\r\ncountries. And it hadn’t happened just in the Third World. “There have\r\nbeen numerous cases in the United Kingdom which revealed that the\r\nBritish intelligence services monitor social activists, labor unions,\r\nand civil liberties groups,” Banisar said in a paper written for Privacy\r\nInternational.[6.32] What’s more, the Canadian Communications Security\r\nEstablishment had shelled out more than $1.1 million to scan through\r\nmillions of messages and pick out dangerous words and phrases.[6.33]\r\nWould the CCSE abuse the system and routinely compile dossiers on\r\nlaw-respecting people? And what about the FBI here in the States? Many\r\nNetfolks took it for granted that Louis Freeh’s people were keeping up\r\nwith Usenet.\r\n\r\n“The FBI has the ability to police the Internet and, indeed, has been\r\ndoing so,” David Nadler and Kendrick Fong, two tech-oriented lawyers,\r\nwould write later on in _Computer Digest: The Journal of Professional\r\nDevelopment for the Washington-Baltimore Technology Community_. “In\r\nfact, the FBI has been collecting Usenet postings since the late 1980s.”\r\n\r\nA formulaic condemnation of all FBI monitoring, however, would be\r\nunfair. I could hardly object to the Feds reading the public messages of\r\negotistical nuts with a clear-cut predilection for violence. What better\r\nreason _not_ to censor Usenet and any audio and video equivalents that\r\nmight follow? Let the kooks rant away, hour after hour, educating Louis\r\nFreeh about their plans. Usenet wasn’t anyone’s living room. Posting\r\nmessages there was like publishing a book or speaking in a town square.\r\nVia the free Stanford Netnews Filtering Service, I could receive\r\nelectronic mail messages whenever a specified word showed up in a major\r\narea of Usenet. Yes, I could track people by name. I could also choose\r\nwords associated with a topic. That was the magic of the Net; it gave us\r\nsmall-fry many of the same tools available to the intelligence\r\nbureaucracies. The same kind of wizardry that might let Canadian cops\r\nsnoop on citizens could allow me to track the utterances of Al Gore on\r\nthe subject, say, of the Internet.\r\n\r\nOne technology, however, may have bureaucrats more uncomfortable than\r\nany other—encryption. A U.S. database expert named Patrick Ball found\r\nthis out the hard way when he was in Ethiopia to help the Office of the\r\nSpecial Prosecutor. Ball efficiently helped build a database of crimes\r\nthat had occurred under the regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam. He was\r\naccomplishing plenty. Then a bureaucratic rival started a turf war with\r\nhim. The man falsely claimed that Ball had been using PGP for secret\r\ncorrespondence, probably with the CIA, even though the truth was a\r\nlittle more mundane. Ball hadn’t used PGP for anything but test\r\nmessages; the people at the other end lacked the technical skills. But\r\nthe rival didn’t know. He confused PGP with uuencoding—a way to prepare\r\nprograms for accurate transmission via e-mail—and unfortunately the\r\nchief special prosecutor believed Ball’s accuser and forced the database\r\nexpert to resign.\r\n\r\nSo often that was the case with police: They displayed a mix of fear and\r\nignorance. And they were not totally wrong to be worried. One computer\r\nexpert predicted that in the next few years criminals would routinely\r\nuse electronic scrambling. “This could signal the end of computer\r\nforensics,” said William Spernow, “before it even gets off the ground.”\r\nA criminal relied on a double set of books, employing PGP to conceal the\r\naccurate one, and dope-peddlers in Miami used encryption.[6.34]\r\n\r\nNot only that, just as I was writing part of this chapter, the\r\nnewspapers told how terrorists in Japan had killed 10 people and injured\r\nabout 5,500 by spreading nerve gas in a Tokyo subway station. Wouldn’t\r\nrestrictions on encryption make such acts harder to commit with\r\nimpunity?\r\n\r\nStrong counterarguments existed, however, against the jackbooters who\r\nwould ban strong encryption or impose the Clipper variety on us. I would\r\nrather that nations not spy on each other. But I fully recall the\r\nnaiveté of the past, the fantasy that “gentlemen do not open other\r\ngentlemen’s mail”; whether we liked it or not, espionage and\r\ncounterespionage would always go on. In that spirit, instead of wasting\r\nmoney on Clipperish schemes, countries could spend money developing more\r\npowerful computers to crack encryption, and they could also refine the\r\nunscrambling techniques. That would not be cheap. But since bad guys\r\nwouldn’t let Clipper or successors be the apex of technology, the United\r\nStates hadn’t any other choice. Other countries might feel otherwise.\r\nBureaucrats just couldn’t contain technology. Clipperish schemes would\r\nbe brainless in any country.\r\n\r\nAs one alternative, governments could rely more heavily on open\r\nsources—for example, newspapers and other media outlets, especially\r\nthose online. The more journalists out there, and the more independent\r\nthey were, the harder it would be for nations to keep secrets and\r\nconspire against each other. The United States and friends had the most\r\nselfish of reasons for encouraging the spread of the free press.\r\n\r\nThe open source idea was hardly original to me. Others had talked about\r\nit for years, most notably Robert Steele, the ex-CIA agent, who observed\r\nthat publicly available material was often far more useful than the\r\nclandestinely gathered variety. I didn’t agree with much of what Steele\r\nsaid—I wanted more isolation between journalists and government than he\r\nmight have liked. But his basic point was sound. Information was most\r\nreliable when it was in the open and could be dissected, rather than\r\nhiding it behind a “secret” stamp. The spread of network technology\r\ncould only strengthen this premise.\r\n\r\nYet another approach could be the selective use of agents, in new-style\r\nroles, taking advantage of high technology. Here again I had mixed\r\nfeelings. But in an era when countries such as Iraq were trying to\r\ndevelop nuclear weapons, this option should be kept alive.\r\n\r\nWhat about terrorists? As with child-molesting rings and drug cartels,\r\nClipper just would not do any good. Secret groups would be the last in\r\nthe world to use the chip. Far better for intelligence agencies to work\r\non more powerful computers and truly effective software for cracking\r\ncodes. Breakthroughs might not come immediately, but would sooner or\r\nlater, and the civilian sector might ultimately benefit when the\r\ntechnology finally did reach the world at large. Advanced\r\nsupercomputers, for example, could be used for weather forecasting, or\r\nfor graphics and design—the same wizardry that had helped make possible\r\nthe Visible Human Project described in the last chapter.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile an open-source approach could often do the job. The accused\r\nterrorists in Japan hadn’t exactly stayed hidden from the world before\r\nthe subway incidents. Shoko Asahara, their leader, had delivered sermon\r\nafter sermon with allusions to poisonous gas; in the city of Matsumoto\r\nwhere he had been at odds with authorities over some land, 7 people had\r\ndied and 200 had suffered injuries when a cloud of sarin wafted in the\r\narea. Small wonder that the Japanese government had caught up with the\r\nsect so soon after the Tokyo tragedy. Newspaper databases would have\r\ntold plenty, beyond any information that happened to be in the\r\ngovernment’s own records.\r\n\r\nLegally authorized bugs might be yet another solution, and so, at times,\r\nmight be informers wired to make the best case. In an era of\r\nnear-invisible electronics, this approach would be increasingly\r\npractical.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, if Bill Clinton and Al Gore really cared about protecting\r\ncitizens in a high-tech age, they would worry less about snooping on\r\ncitizens and more about hardening up points of vulnerability. Steele\r\nnoted how easily criminals could “maliciously interfere with the\r\ncomputers that control the power system. It is relatively easy to\r\ndestroy computer capabilities—this takes much less skill than to ‘crack’\r\nthem and divert computing resources.” Also, terrorists could wreak havoc\r\nwith computers that controlled telephone systems in such areas as\r\ncommunications for government and banking.\r\n\r\nHe also warned of interference with the computers of Wall Street and the\r\nFederal Reserve. “Trillions in digital data” could vanish into the\r\nether. “A massive global economic panic” would ensue. Preventative\r\nmeasures wouldn’t be cheap, but if the American government did care\r\nabout security, it would prepare realistically for the threats of the\r\ninformation era rather than doing an inept Big Brother act.\r\n\r\nTo rig up a whole nation for wire taps would be both a waste and a\r\ndisgrace. I pondered the ironies. Here the NSA and similar agencies were\r\nsupposed to protect normality—to guard families against dopesters, sex\r\nperverts, terrorists, and the rest—and yet Phil Zimmermann the husband\r\nand father might go to jail. “I think it’s kind of unreal to him,”\r\nZimmermann said when I asked how his son felt about this. “I tell him\r\nthat I have some talented lawyers working for me, and that we’re doing\r\nthe best we can.” And Zimmermann’s wife? “She thinks that they can’t\r\npossibly indict me, because that would be wrong—that somehow they’ll\r\nrealize that and just back out. Of course by the time your book is\r\nprinted, we’ll know one way or the other whether she was right.”\r\n\r\nA Few Words about Library Books,\r\nDemocracy, and Socks the Cybercat\r\n\r\nThe White House in the 1990s was extolling computer nets as a way to\r\nBring Government Closer to the People. Americans could dial up “An\r\nInteractive Citizens’ Handbook” on the Internet, see a photo of a\r\nteenaged Clinton with JFK, and listen to Socks the Clinton cat meow. But\r\ncould Clinton-Gore hear _us_? Just how “interactive” was the White\r\nHouse?\r\n\r\nClinton boosters formed a group called Americans Communicating\r\nElectronically to improve electronic contacts between mortals and\r\nbureaucrats. Al Gore, meanwhile, had flaunted his typing skills with the\r\nfamous visit to CompuServe. But was electronic democracy truly alive on\r\nthe Internet and other computer networks? Not quite. All the techish\r\nsizzle notwithstanding, Clinton-Gore might instead be giving us\r\nelectronic oligarchy, especially if Republicans followed the horrible\r\nprecedents that the White House was setting. Consider the dubious,\r\nsomewhat Orwellian process that was shaping the National Information\r\nInfrastructure—the famous data highways and related endeavors.\r\n\r\nSo far Washington had not worked nearly as hard as it should to drive\r\ndown the cost of knowledge for the average American. At the same time a\r\nnetwork-hostile copyright proposal was delighting information\r\nmonopolists and imperiling the ability of citizens to share electronic\r\nnewspaper clips in even a limited way.\r\n\r\nI testified at an official hearing on the NII in 1993, and what most\r\nstruck me about Clinton-Gore was the chasm between words and deeds—the\r\nsame mind-set that led to Oceania’s propaganda agency being named the\r\nMinistry of Truth. The gospel according to Al Gore was that people of\r\nall income levels would be able to travel the dataways. His musings\r\nlater adorned the peach-colored newsprint of _The Mini Page_, a\r\nnewspaper insert for children.\r\n\r\n“No longer will geographical location, wealth, gender, or any other\r\nfactor limit learning,” Gore reassured elementary schoolers. He told how\r\n“a child from my home town of Carthage, Tennessee, will be able to come\r\nhome from school, turn on a computer, and plug into the Library of\r\nCongress in Washington, D.C.” The NII would clearly be in the grand\r\ndemocratic tradition, small “d.”\r\n\r\nThe next day, however, the _Washington Post_ carried news of a\r\ndifferent stripe from Bruce Lehman, the Clinton-Gore commissioner of\r\npatents and trademarks, who chaired the NII working group on\r\nintellectual property. I learned that “because of the ease of digital\r\nreproduction, Lehman does not foresee that digital libraries will put\r\ncopyrighted works within easy reach online the way they do books on a\r\nlibrary shelf. Copyrighted digital materials are likely to be\r\navailable only to subscribers—libraries, for example—who pay royalty\r\nfees, he said. People who want the material might have to go to their\r\nlocal library and use a computer there that would not allow them to\r\ncopy or redistribute the work, Lehman said.”[6.35] A few months later\r\nBruce Lehman would graciously tell the _Wall Street Journal_ that,\r\nyes, he would tolerate children carrying home copyrighted CD-ROMs and\r\nfloppies of electronic books.[6.36]\r\n\r\nCompared to networked books, however, the CDs and the rest would be\r\npathetic. Distribution over the Internet and other networks could be the\r\ncheapest way to get the material spread around, while assuring a wide\r\nvariety of material for all. When William Buckley likened CD-ROMs to\r\n78-rpm shellac records in the era of the Internet, he couldn’t have been\r\nmore precise. And yet this was the future as envisioned by Bill\r\nClinton’s intellectual property czar. So much for the well-informed\r\ncitizenry needed for a Jeffersonian America. Lehman was beating the\r\nbushes for electronic oligarchy.\r\n\r\nOnce I had felt that the Clinton-Gore people might truly share my own\r\negalitarian dreams. I’d thought that nonlobbyists like me stood a\r\nhealthy chance. I had been writing about computers for close to a\r\ndecade; earlier I had covered a poverty beat, and I knew how we could\r\ndrive down the cost of small computers so that someday even Head Start\r\nkids could read electronic books on them. What better way to encourage\r\ndemocracy? The whole country, not just the elite, could grow up\r\nunderstanding abstract thought. Could the Constitution have been drafted\r\nby a mob of illiterate TV watchers?\r\n\r\nRather than letting Big Brother choose books for us, we could establish\r\na democratic system with many librarians in many cities empowered to\r\nmake acquisitions. Never would bureaucrats be able to do the equivalent\r\nof tweaking old copies of the _London Times_ behind our backs. It would\r\nbe too damn hard with so many librarians in so many locations, and with\r\nthe same material reposing on millions and millions of tablet-style\r\ncomputers that individual Americans owned. My vision was one of\r\nelectronic federalism, not of Big Brother policing our reading tastes.\r\nTeleRead wouldn’t undermine local schools and public libraries. Quite\r\nthe contrary. TeleRead would buy affordable, sharp-screened machines for\r\nthem, sending a signal to Silicon Valley and paving the way for similar\r\ncomputers to go on sale at the Kmart for $99.95 for anyone to buy.\r\n\r\nJust as important, unlike the Postal plan mentioned earlier in this\r\nchapter, my TeleRead plan would let schools and libraries use the\r\nhardware without Big Brotherish restrictions. They could store whatever\r\nthey wanted on their own computers for local people to dial up. And to\r\nmake the national library more useful at the local level, they could add\r\nspecial, Web-style links designed for the people they served—not just\r\nfor whole communities, but perhaps even for individual readers.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, TeleRead would respect diversity and freedom of expression\r\nin other ways. Publishers could gamble fees up front to bypass\r\nlibrarians and qualify for royalties, and if censored from the national\r\nlibrary, they could post on the Net itself. I took it for granted that\r\nWashington would try to censor TeleRead. That was the reason I\r\nenvisioned a whole network of many librarians, in many places, together\r\nwith long-range funding. Besides, my plan reflected the old wisdom from\r\nhackers: When censorship arises, just route around it. Private companies\r\ncould make some nice money off officially banned books. Imagine the\r\npromotional opportunities; “Nixed by Washington” could be the new\r\n“Banned in Boston.” What’s more, since TeleRead was public and involved\r\nmany librarians, not just a tiny D.C. elite, any censorship would\r\nprobably be much more conspicuous than in the world of corporate\r\npublishing.\r\n\r\nIn other ways, too, TeleRead would be anti-Big Brother. Americans would\r\nnot have to make private companies privy to their reading habits. The\r\nnational library could track dialups for the purpose of paying writers\r\nand publishers—you couldn’t retrieve books without reporting past\r\naccesses. But TeleRead would include protections. Records associated\r\nwith individual users could be temporary, just a way to prevent\r\ninformation providers from abusing the system with repeated dialups.\r\nPeople could buy controversial books by way of anonymous digital money.\r\nIn fact, with sophisticated enough fraud controls, the same techniques\r\nmight eventually be used to prevent names from being associated with\r\ndialup records even for a short time. If nothing else, people could\r\nentrust TeleRead records to certified private companies that reported\r\naccesses without revealing identities.\r\n\r\nTeleRead, then, could provide even more safeguards than public library\r\nrecords in the paper era—significant, since librarians by habit had\r\nrespected privacy much more than had other government officials. “There\r\nwas a case back in Nixon’s era,” Phil Zimmermann would eventually remind\r\nme, “where Nixon tried to find out what some of his enemies were reading\r\nat the library, and the librarians were, of course, up in arms about\r\nbeing asked to supply a list of books that had been checked out by a\r\nparticular person or a list of people that had checked out a particular\r\nbook. They were able to resist the efforts by the government to obtain\r\nthat information. I think that we need to have the same kind of controls\r\nin place for future libraries that are on the Net.” I couldn’t have\r\nagreed more.\r\n\r\nEven the hardware could serve to thwart Big Brother by promoting free\r\nexpression and democracy. TeleRead would let people talk back to\r\nbureaucrats and among themselves; the machines would work with\r\nkeyboards, and someday they might even serve in part as wireless digital\r\ntelephones, not just computers. TeleRead would let Americans all be more\r\nuppity. The information in the national library would enrich public\r\ndebate; it would at least somewhat blur distinctions between the wealthy\r\nand those who otherwise couldn’t afford top-quality information.\r\n\r\nThis needn’t be just a dream. The United States had a $6-trillion-plus\r\neconomy, and if just some of us used electronic forms for government and\r\ncommercial transactions, we eventually would save tens of billions in\r\ntime and money. As noted earlier in this book, the same pen interfaces\r\nthat were ideal for reading would be great for forms. E-forms could help\r\nflag errors in tax returns and other documents, “interview” users\r\nquickly, and just as quickly narrow down questions to the essentials.\r\nAnd so the saving in time and money could easily justify a well-stocked\r\nnational library. No magic was involved here, just an old principle of\r\ninformation management. Two applications (smart forms and the electronic\r\nbooks) made more sense than just one (the books). In fact, the American\r\nSociety for Information Science would later approach me to do a chapter\r\non electronic libraries for an ASIS book from MIT Press, and I would\r\noblige. Clearly TeleRead was a logical link between Gore’s plans for\r\nreinventing government and his oft-claimed desire to drive down the cost\r\nof knowledge.\r\n\r\nI was a writer, not an attorney or information scientist, but a number\r\nof well-credentialed people understood the logic of TeleRead, even when\r\nI showed them a version somewhat less refined than the one just\r\ndescribed. At the urging of a distinguished Washington lawyer, I applied\r\nto testify at the interagency hearings on intellectual property law in\r\nthe digital age. But he warned me some bizarreness was afoot. Experts\r\nfrom the Library of Congress would not run the hearings; nowadays\r\nelectronic books would be more within the domain of the Commerce\r\nDepartment. A Commerce bureaucrat instead would be the main player\r\nhere—Bruce Lehman. That should have been my tip-off that the proceedings\r\nwould be big and furry and jump, and come with a pocket for joeys; but I\r\nwent ahead just the same. The lawyer organizing the hearing seemed\r\nfriendly, alert, intelligent, receptive. She said each witness would\r\ntestify just a few minutes, and that after the hearings the Feds would\r\ncarefully examine our words.\r\n\r\nMy optimism grew. I expected at least a modicum of electronic democracy,\r\nGore-style, just as promised. So in November 1993 I joined some thirty\r\nother witnesses in Crystal City, Virginia, across the Potomac from\r\nWashington. Bill Clinton wanted his presidential cabinet to look like\r\nAmerica, and, in fact, a black man was secretary of the Commerce. Gazing\r\naround the room, however, I saw a sea of white lawyers in dark suits,\r\nalong with a scattering of women in power clothes. I could have been in\r\nCalifornia at an elite convocation of the software and entertainment\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\nI ran into one of the members of the intellectual property group, a\r\nminor White House advisor named David Lytel, who had promised to read my\r\nproposal as sent to him on the Internet. Mr. White House didn’t waste a\r\nnanosecond. “This is like Hollywood,” Lytel said. “Not everyone can be a\r\nstar. We can’t use everyone’s idea.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not here to star,” I said, “just to testify. Have you read my\r\nproposal?”\r\n\r\nHe said he had seen the prepared testimony I had left at the entrance to\r\nthe auditorium.\r\n\r\n“But what about the thousands of words I sent you on the Net? I thought\r\nyou’d have a look and—”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me,” he said and moved on.\r\n\r\nHis Hollywood analogy would strike me later as all too apt, for this was\r\nshaping up as a TV-centric NII that favored television and movies over\r\nbooks. Al Gore later would not hold his grand information summit at the\r\nLibrary of Congress; no, he would jet off to Hollywood and to a speech\r\npunctuated by jokes with a comedienne.\r\n\r\nThere in the Crystal City auditorium, I saw a tall, gray-haired man\r\nsurrounded by a cluster of other people. Heads bobbed. Stephen Metalitz\r\nwas a lawyer and a power in the Information Industries Association, the\r\nIIA. “Welcome, Steve,” Lehman greeted his first witness in a voice that\r\ntold me who the true star of the day was. The rest of the hearing\r\nunfolded as I now feared. Witnesses from trade associations pounded away\r\nat the same theme again and again. Copyright law needed to be friendly\r\nto megaconglomerates or they would never bless the dataways with their\r\n_Terminator_ films. It was as if the Internet, already starting to\r\nbristle with small businesses, never existed.\r\n\r\nI heard some cogent testimony from some fine people representing\r\nlibrarians and educators, but all in all, I might as well have been at\r\nan IIA convention. Lehman’s panel of bureaucrats, some of them strangers\r\nto copyright law, just about dozed off during my testimony. Chatting\r\nwith me informally, certain industry witnesses were more curious about\r\nmy ideas than were the Feds. It wasn’t just to size up the opposition.\r\nFor my plan would divert resources from bureaucracy to knowledge, and\r\ncould actually _help_ many members of the information industry.\r\n\r\nA potential obstacle rose ahead, though: the hostility of real, live\r\nbureaucrats.\r\n\r\nDuring a break I approached a working-group member from one of the most\r\nbureaucratic agencies of them all, the General Services Administration.\r\n“What do you think of my ideas for electronic forms?” I asked. “I\r\nremember when you guys let a senator benefit illegally from a federal\r\nlease on an office building. Imagine what you could have done with\r\nbetter technology to help flag stuff like that.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” he said coldly, “we can just train our contracting officers\r\nbetter.” Better to protect jobs for bureaucrats like him than to offer\r\naffordable e-books for schoolchildren.\r\n\r\nMy foremost opponent, however, as I learned eventually, just may have\r\nbeen Lehman himself—the chairman of the Intellectual Property Working\r\nGroup, which would help set copyright policy for America’s dataways.\r\n\r\nBruce Lehman was Mr. Politically Correct. As his heroes he claimed the\r\ncareer-enhancing names of Bill Clinton and Martin Luther King; never\r\nmind the damage that his child-hostile copyright policies might do to\r\nghetto schools, or the fact that the copyright hearing had been about as\r\nwell integrated as a Klan meeting. The _New York Times_ would see in\r\nLehman’s office “a handsomely framed photograph taken at last year’s\r\nWhite House Christmas party. Bill and Hillary Clinton stand in the\r\nmiddle. Mr. Lehman is to the left, under a portrait of George\r\nWashington.”\r\n\r\nHis clothes were as aggressively fashionable as his choice of heroes.\r\nThe _Times_’s Teresa Riordan would write of “stylish suits detailed with\r\na fresh white handkerchief.” He might display “a touch of exotic color,\r\nperhaps a mint-colored watchband or the ruby background of a Brooks\r\nBrother tie.”[6.37] Lehman needn’t haunt any thrift shops. During a\r\ntwelve- to fourteen-month period before joining the Administration, he\r\nhad pulled down $430,000 as a lobbyist and lawyer for intellectual\r\nproperty clients.[6.38]\r\n\r\nThe patent office’s Web site said he had represented “individuals,\r\ncompanies, and trade associations in the area of intellectual property\r\nrights as it affects the motion picture, telecommunications,\r\npharmaceutical, computer software, and broadcasting industries.”[6.39]\r\nHis clients had included Lotus and Microsoft.[6.40] The latter was\r\nbuying up electronic rights as if they were soft drinks for the\r\nprogrammers’ offices. No, Microsoft would hardly be the world’s leading\r\nbacker of a universally affordable, well-stocked national digital\r\nlibrary of the TeleRead variety. I’d lobby anyone, any company, for my\r\nidea. But could I ever persuade Microsoft? Oh, come on. This was the\r\ncompany that owned the word “Windows.”\r\n\r\nClinton-Gore campaigners had once talked of “People First.” Based on\r\nLehman’s background and proclivities, however, a better motto in the\r\ncase of intellectual property might now be “Entertainment, Information,\r\nand Software Magnates First.” It was as if Clinton-Gore had turned\r\nnational health policy over to a zealous insurance lobbyist who had\r\nspent years crusading for higher premiums.\r\n\r\nEven at the local level, Lehman was no stranger to the world of money\r\nand politics. In 1991, while a Georgetown lawyer, he had lent $10,000 at\r\n12 percent interest to Washington city council candidate Jim Zais even\r\nthough local law apparently restricted candidates to borrowing only from\r\nthe usual lending institutions. Zais at the time had raised less than\r\n$13,000 from other sources. Questioned by election officials, the\r\ncandidate had claimed ignorance of the law and promptly paid the money\r\nback to Lehman, along with some $120 in interest.[6.41]\r\n\r\nLike many of his ex-colleagues at Swidler & Berlin, Lehman had kept his\r\ncheckbook wide open when national politicians needed money. Many months\r\nlater I learned that between January 1, 1991, and November 28, 1994, the\r\nS & B crowd had made at least $191,000 in political donations, including\r\nmore than $22,000 from Lehman himself during his days there. At least\r\n$146,000 of the $191,000 had gone to the firm’s political-action\r\ncommittee. Lehman’s personal contributions had reached at least eighteen\r\ncongressional candidates. In fairness, let me emphasize that Lehman\r\ndidn’t just have direct career considerations in mind—he was the first\r\nopenly gay man whom the U.S. Senate had confirmed as a top federal\r\nofficial,[6.42] and he had given generously to gay political-action\r\ncommittees.\r\n\r\nGay groups, in turn, showed their loyalty. They had wanted Clinton to\r\nappoint Bruce Lehman to _something_, and the White House had made him\r\npatent commissioner even though Lehman knew more about copyrights. Ron\r\nBrown, however, secretary of Commerce, said: “Bruce Lehman is not here\r\nbecause he’s gay. He’s the absolutely best person for the job.”[6.43]\r\n\r\nI believed Brown. If the Clinton Administration wanted library interests\r\nto be kept at bay to placate rich campaign donors, Gore’s dreamy\r\nrhetoric notwithstanding, no one would beat Lehman the ex-lobbyist.\r\n\r\nA few weeks after the intellectual property hearing in Crystal City, a\r\nletter arrived from Mr. Reinventing Government himself. I had mailed my\r\nTeleRead proposal and a related _Washington Post_ clip to Al Gore many\r\nmonths ago in spring 1993, and now he replied: “I am impressed with this\r\ndetailed and very professional presentation. The information you\r\nprovided certainly appears to contain ideas that merit careful\r\nattention. I will retain this material for future consideration as the\r\nPresident and I work on related policies and programs.” I hardly\r\nexpected a meeting with Clinton and Gore. But was it just possible that\r\none of their GS-14s might deem me worth five minutes of time, and follow\r\nup with a few questions?\r\n\r\nMonths passed. An occasional reporter or academic would read my\r\ntestimony and call or e-mail, but no one phoned from Commerce.\r\nMeanwhile, seeing my TeleRead proposal on the Net, major vendors\r\ncontacted me. Often they asked the big question: “How are you doing in\r\nWashington?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said in effect, “I hope they’re keeping an open mind.”\r\n\r\n“That’s nice, bye,” the answers would more or less come back—assuming I\r\nheard again from people at all. The NII wasn’t just TV-centric. It was\r\nGore-centric. If you lacked his blessing, and his bland letter to me\r\ndidn’t count, you were dead or at least comatose unless the right word\r\nfrom the White House revived your idea.\r\n\r\nThen a “Green Paper” revealing the Clinton Administration’s preliminary\r\nviews on data highways and copyright came out. It was even more horrid\r\nthan I could have imagined, an insult to the memory of Andrew Carnegie.\r\nThe ethos was exactly the opposite of TeleRead’s. For example, if the\r\npaper became law, one could not transmit a newspaper article to a few\r\nfriends; the present ambiguities here would be resolved in favor of the\r\ncopyright holders. Yes, Washington should not allow anyone to bootleg\r\nnewspaper stories or magazine items for hundreds of people in an\r\nelectronic discussion group. In fact, I’d once reported a gross offender\r\nto a magazine; I believed passionately in property rights. Clearly\r\nelectronic books, of all media, should enjoy protection, which, in fact,\r\nTeleRead would promote by making piracy less lucrative. But we also had\r\nto understand the purpose of copyright law—to help spread information in\r\na democracy and further the progress of science and the arts. Lehman\r\neither was disingenuous or had let his old $430,000 make him a little\r\namnesic toward Constitutional tradition.\r\n\r\nIronically, if Lehman’s side won out, writers and journalists would be\r\namong the biggest victims of the very law designed to protect us. After\r\nall, we were not just producers of information; we were also consumers.\r\nTo write a book I would absorb millions of words from the Internet,\r\nswapping information with friend after friend along the way, including,\r\nyes, some electronic newspaper clips. But the Green Paper bizarrely\r\nflouted the natural tendency of most people to _share_. Imagine the\r\neffect on teachers and children. Quite rightly, Jim Warren observed that\r\nWashington was cheating the public “to avoid controversy among\r\n‘important’ people.”\r\n\r\n“The Draft Report comes down firmly on the side of increased rights for\r\ncopyright owners in all relevant contexts, endorsing the goal of\r\nenhanced copyright protection without acknowledging any countervailing\r\nconcerns,” wrote Jessica Litman, a law professor at Detroit’s Wayne\r\nState University. In a reply to the Administration she said of the\r\nreport: “It appears to be an advocacy document: It at times\r\nmisrepresents the state of current law, and gives voice to only one side\r\nof complicated policy debates.”\r\n\r\nAnother expert, law professor Pamela Samuelson at the University of\r\nPittsburgh, lambasted the Green Paper in an article for _Communications\r\nof the ACM_, published by the Association for Computing Machinery. She\r\nsaid that “not since the King of England in the sixteenth century gave a\r\ngroup of printers exclusive rights to print books in exchange for the\r\nprinters’ agreement not to print heretical or seditious material has a\r\ngovernment copyright policy been so skewed in favor of publisher\r\ninterests and so detrimental to the public interest.” Contrary to\r\nWashington’s claim, the Green Paper was not just a tweaking of existing\r\nlaw but a radical revision in favor of publishers.[6.44]\r\n\r\nDirectly Orwellian questions arose. What about enforcement? How to\r\nthwart the ease of mailing copies over the Net? The Green Paper’s\r\ndesigners thought that laws against circumventing copy protection would\r\nprovide one of the main answers. But in the case of electronic text,\r\nsuch visions were far too sanguine. People would want the capability to\r\nprint out material, and if they could print it out, they could scan it\r\nand put it online again without the protection feature; what’s more,\r\nhackers would inevitably develop software to accomplish the same thing\r\nelectronically.\r\n\r\nYes, the Green Paper would let publishers and others sue makers of\r\ndevices that could get around copy protection. But just what gear was\r\ncovered? Scanners? Fax machines? And what kinds of software? What about\r\nlegitimate programs that also had illicit uses? Were we the new Soviets,\r\nliving in fear of the digital equivalent of copiers and other subversive\r\ngadgets? As William Buckley would write, “fax machines and e-mail\r\noutwitted and frustrated even the comprehensive revolutionary orders of\r\nStalin and Mao. This side of what used to be the Iron Curtain, we should\r\nhave the resources to handle our native bureaucracy.” The Green Paper\r\nwas nothing more than Big Bureaucracy trying to serve Big Business.\r\n\r\nThe Green Paper had much in common with Clipper. In both cases\r\nbureaucrats were reducing respect for Washington by trying to control\r\nthe uncontrollable. I was hardly a kneejerker crying out for a\r\npigmy-sized government. My liberalism remained. I favored prenatal\r\nnutrition programs, Head Start, public broadcasting, and a host of other\r\nwonderful anachronisms from the heyday of the Democrats. And yet here\r\nwas the Clinton Administration blundering along in the most obnoxious\r\nway and turning so many of my fellow liberals on the Internet into\r\nlibertarians.\r\n\r\nIf nothing else, the White House was complicating my job of trying to\r\nsell the Net on TeleRead. It was not just a question of preempting my\r\nidea in favor of an inferior solution rigged up for Clinton’s powerful\r\nfriends in entertainment and publishing. Like Clipper, the Green Paper\r\nwas lessening faith in Washington, period—no small concern for somebody\r\nadvocating a national program such as TeleRead, even one developed with\r\nlocal sensibilities in mind. Sometimes I wondered if Lehman might be a\r\nManchurian Patent Commissioner.[6.45] Had the Libertarians brainwashed\r\nhim to sully Washington’s good name?\r\n\r\nAgain and again I flamed Lehman’s Green Paper on alt.activism and at\r\nleast half a dozen other newsgroups on the Internet. I hadn’t any\r\nchoice. He hated the bytes-want-to-be-free philosophy of TeleRead.\r\nClearly, if Lehman had read TeleRead, it would have driven him nuts,\r\ngiven his apparent belief that copyrighted books must _cost_ readers.\r\nTeleRead, on the other hand, would mean fair treatment of copyright\r\nholders and library users alike. With a TeleRead-style library,\r\npublishers, writers, and private nets could still charge for many\r\ncategories of information and earn handsome sums from online conferences\r\nand other services and products, including customized software to guide\r\npeople through electronic libraries. Also, they would receive fair\r\nroyalties for covered material such as books. At the same time, however,\r\nthanks to the cost justification provided by the e-forms, we could make\r\nelectronic books free in this TV-fixated era and thus encourage\r\nliteracy.\r\n\r\nSurely TeleRead could be a logical link between Gore’s plans for\r\nreinventing government and his oft-claimed desire to drive down the cost\r\nof knowledge. With TeleRead, the old scarcities could be obsolete; rich\r\nand poor could dial up the same books. It would be a far cry from the\r\npresent when Beverly Hills spent many times more on library materials\r\nthan did some poorer jurisdictions. TeleRead was not a cure-all; but in\r\nan era of tight budgets, the national library could be phased in\r\ncarefully, year by year, topic by topic, with minimal pain. The\r\nreduction of expensive, onerous paperwork would be like a tax rebate.\r\nFor once, a program could simultaneously help schoolchildren and small\r\nbusiness people.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the NII Advisory Council would see merit in TeleRead. The White\r\nHouse didn’t necessarily have to follow its recommendations, but wasn’t\r\nthis the age of electronic democracy and citizens’ input? A few problems\r\nhad arisen, however. Bill Clinton’s people had tolerated just one\r\nlibrarian among the more than thirty members of the Council. An\r\noverworked teacher was there representing education. But no full-time\r\nprofessional writers of books, and just one newspaper publisher, had\r\nended up tainting the Advisory Council.\r\n\r\nNor did any name show up from a distinguished publishing firm such as\r\nKnopf or Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Instead the White House blessed the\r\nNII with Vance Opperman, a friend of Al Gore’s and a money man for the\r\nDemocratic Party,[6.46] who was president of West Publishing. By one\r\nestimate West grossed some $600 million a year with pretax margins of\r\nalmost 30 percent, or twice those of rivals.[6.47] West-style firms were\r\nfamous for Cadillac-priced data. Opperman’s company had set up\r\ncollections of court opinions and slapped a proprietary system of\r\ncitations on them. The meter typically ran at $4 a minute or more,\r\nadding up to millions from Feds and taxpayers alike.\r\n\r\nHaunted by a group called the Taxpayer Assets Project, the Justice\r\nDepartment had proposed an electronic database with public-domain\r\ncitations to help users locate material. But West had lobbied away the\r\nplans. Nothing must deprive Al Gore’s friend, and so many other\r\npoliticians’ friend, of a chance to turn a buck. Opperman seemed about\r\nas eager to drive down the cost of knowledge as Bull Connor was to\r\nfurther civil rights in the days of cattle prods and police dogs.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Advisory Council teemed with people from such\r\nlibrary-like outfits as CBS, Black Entertainment Television, and Walt\r\nDisney. Bill Clinton’s people also let the movie industry’s premier\r\nlobbyist sit on the council—Jack Valenti, a former aide to Lyndon\r\nJohnson; yes, the same Valenti who had made history years ago by\r\nsleeping better at night because, he said, LBJ was in the White House.\r\nTo the Council, too, went powerful telephone executives, a man from\r\nMicrosoft, and John Scully, the former Apple executive who had been a\r\nClinton stalwart in ’92. A co-chair was a Clinton supporter named Ed\r\nMcCracken. He came from Silicon Graphics, a billion-dollar company that\r\nwas hoping to make a fortune off the new video technology.\r\n\r\nClearly entertainment was what counted most here. The term National\r\nInformation Infrastructure just didn’t suffice. A more accurate\r\ndescription, given the paucity of librarians, educators, and journalists\r\non the council, would have been the National _Entertainment_\r\nInfrastructure. Yes, people like Vance Opperman were interested in\r\nelectronic text, but, above all, from a business perspective. Let the\r\nmasses watch TV. His company would make a fortune selling pricey\r\ninformation to the elite.\r\n\r\nMass literacy just wasn’t the main show here, not with all the dutiful\r\nsuits watching out for the earnings of CBS or Disney or Microsoft or\r\nWest, and without enough librarians and others to balance them out.\r\n\r\nA host of other issues remained. How fascinating that so many of the\r\nmost influential people in the Clinton galaxy were from outfits such as\r\ntelephone companies that wanted to profit off both transmission and\r\ncontent. Despite all the rhetoric, I wondered how attentive the\r\nClintonians would be to, say, little companies that were more interested\r\nin producing books or folk albums than in financing _Terminators_ or\r\nlaying fiber optic cables.\r\n\r\nCould money and politics have mattered just a little in the selection of\r\npeople for the NII Advisory Council? If nothing else, a few questions\r\narose in the case of West Publishing, the giant publisher of legal\r\ninformation. Vance Opperman was friends with Mack McLarty, Clinton’s\r\nfirst chief of staff.[6.48] What’s more, Opperman cochaired the finance\r\ncommittee during the 1994 reelection campaign of Dianne Feinstein, a\r\nDemocratic U.S. senator from California who sat on a copyright\r\nsubcommittee within the Judiciary Committee.[6.49] A study by the\r\nTaxpayer Assets Project, one of Ralph Nader’s groups, revealed how\r\ncivic-minded West was. By way of a political-action committee and gifts\r\nfrom lawyers, lobbyists, and family members, the West crowd in five\r\nyears had given more than $738,000 to Congress members and the\r\nDemocratic National Committee.\r\n\r\nJudges, too, must have loved the company. A West-run foundation had\r\ndispensed $15,000 awards to federal judges for “distinguished service to\r\njustice.” Over a dozen years, the selection committee had included seven\r\npast or present members of the U.S. Supreme Court, the ultimate\r\ninterpreter of copyright law. West had paid for trips to places as far\r\noff as Hawaii and the Virgin Islands. Benefiting, according to the\r\n_Minneapolis Star Tribune_, were Justices Anthony Kennedy, Sandra Day\r\nO’Connor, John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia, and now-retired Justices\r\nLewis Powell, Byron White, and William Brennan.[6.50]\r\n\r\nWest impressed me. Via campaign gifts, friends, and favors such as the\r\ntrips, Opperman’s crew had cozied up to all three branches of\r\ngovernment—the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary.\r\n\r\nEager to see how representative West was with its people’s political\r\ngifts, I phoned the Center for Responsive Politics, the Washington-based\r\ngroup from which I simultaneously got information about Lehman. Would\r\nthe Center please send me a printout of congressional and presidential\r\ndonations from some other members of the NII Advisory Council and from\r\npeople and political-action committees associated with their companies?\r\n\r\nA list arrived for the period between January 1, 1991, and November 28,\r\n1994, and I scanned down the names on the laser-printed sheets. The Walt\r\nDisney people hadn’t disappointed me. Advisory Council member John F.\r\nCooke, president of the Disney Channel, had given at least $48,000 to\r\npoliticians from coast to coast and to Democratic organizations.\r\nNon-Council member Jeffrey Katzenberg, then with the Disney\r\nconglomerate, had donated at least $63,000 in one way or another.\r\n\r\nI saw _at least_ $400,000 in Disney-related gifts—donations from top\r\nexecutives were just the start. Cook and Katzenberg on their own\r\ncouldn’t sway the White House and Congress, nor even could all of\r\nDisney; but imagine what Hollywood and other rich industries could do en\r\nmasse to influence copyright and telecommunications policies. What\r\ncounted most wasn’t the person but the industry. At one recent gathering\r\nat Steven Spielberg’s mansion—in spring 1995, a time not covered by the\r\nlaser-printed sheet—Bill Clinton had raised $50,000 per couple.\r\n\r\nWhatever the case, the stray change added up. Over at MCA, Advisory\r\nCouncil member Alvin Teller gave at least $28,250 between early 1991 and\r\nlate 1994, while Lew Wasserman, a nonmember, gave at least $87,000.\r\nAdvisory Council member Jack Valenti, Hollywood’s big lobbyist in D.C.,\r\ndonated at least $56,250.\r\n\r\nAdvisory Council member Stanley Hubbard, chairman and chief\r\nexecutive of Hubbard Broadcasting in Minnesota, also made a good\r\nshowing. He and relatives gave at least $74,000 to people on the\r\nHill, political-action committees, and the Democratic Party.\r\nConfronted with $1,000-per-election limits on political gifts to\r\nmembers of Congress, Hubbard just spread his money around, as if\r\nusing greenbacks like calling cards. His donations reached powers\r\nsuch as Representative Ed Markey of Massachusetts, who, until the\r\nRepublican victory in 1994, chaired the House Subcommittee on\r\nTelecommunications and Finance. Many saw Markey as one of the more\r\nprogressive NII players. Just think, however, what such politicians\r\ncould have done without the distractions of special-interest\r\nmoney—donations not only to them but also to colleagues who would be\r\nmore susceptible to pressure.\r\n\r\nTelephone executives made the NII sugar-daddies list, of course.\r\nAdvisory Council member Bert Roberts Jr., MCI’s chairman and CEO, gave\r\nat least $28,000 to an MCI political-action committee and to\r\npoliticians, ranging from Senator Bob Packwood to, yes, Edward Markey. A\r\nsupporting cast came from the ranks of the MCI employees, including one\r\nof my techie heroes, Vint Cerf, “Mr. Internet,” who contributed at least\r\n$1,000 to the same PAC as Roberts.\r\n\r\nAdvisory Council member James Houghton of Corning Glass donated more\r\nthan $50,000 to members of Congress across the country, and to party,\r\npresidential, and PAC funds. Corning, of course, was rooting for\r\nfiberglass cable—a rival in some ways to wireless technology, which some\r\non the Internet considered the future.\r\n\r\nNo, the millionaires on the Advisory Council had not committed crimes or\r\nbribed anyone. Under the law, they had a right to give massive amounts\r\nto campaigns as long as each gift did not exceed the legal limits. To my\r\nknowledge no money had come from anyone’s corporate tills, just from\r\nindividuals and the political-action committees to which they had\r\nlawfully contributed. Besides, just like Lehman, many other rich donors\r\nmust have had the most heartfelt of reasons for personal donations,\r\ngoing far beyond copyright and telecommunications issues. Even though\r\ncopyright holders had donated to many well-positioned politicians such\r\nas Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was active on intellectual property\r\nmatters, that was hardly the only reason why Hollywood millionaires\r\ngave. The woman was a California Democrat. Many people at companies such\r\nas MCA were the same. If a Californian, I myself might have voted for\r\nher.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the people of West Publishing must have had varied motives in\r\ncontributing.[6.51] Vance Opperman was a former antiwar protester and\r\nprobably still saw himself as a force for social good. I suspected, too,\r\nthat he loved seeing his old friend Al Gore grow in power. At the 1992\r\nDemocratic Convention Opperman had described himself as a “political\r\njunkie” who enjoyed hosting political receptions for fun. “I don’t\r\nexpect to get any political benefits out of them.”[6.52]\r\n\r\nReplying on February 22, 1995, to questions from the _Minneapolis Star\r\nTribune_, Opperman’s company noted that all donations were legal and on\r\nrecord at the Federal Election Commission. “It appears that you believe\r\nthe laws regarding these matters should be changed,” West said. “If so,\r\nthe proper thing for you to do is to seek to change these laws rather\r\nthan criticize those who carefully comply with existing law.” The\r\ncompany denied any efforts to influence officials improperly. West said\r\nthat its employees, its political-action committee, and its counsel all\r\nhad “long histories of being active in the political process. It is\r\ninaccurate to tie their donations over the past 20 years to any specific\r\nissue of legislation pending before a government body. Your inference\r\nthat such donations have been made as one collective effort is also\r\ntotally untrue.”[6.53]\r\n\r\nWest pointed out to the _Star Tribune_ that people from rival\r\ninformation companies were also making contributions. But of course!\r\nMoney always counted in politics. Vance Opperman had put it well several\r\nyears ago as head of Opperman Heins & Paquin, a leading law firm notable\r\nfor PAC gifts to Minneapolis politicians. “If we have those who oppose\r\nthe interests of our clients,” he said, “we do not support them.” He\r\nsaid the law firm’s PAC ran under this philosophy: “Support your\r\nfriends. Punish your enemies.”[6.54]\r\n\r\nPresumably Bill Clinton and Al Gore would rather avoid punishment from\r\nthe Oppermans of this nation. While almost ignoring librarians and\r\neducators, the Administration had appointed to its Advisory Council some\r\nmembers of the elite who were already over-represented in the political\r\nprocess. Did Vance Opperman, as a friend of Gore’s, really have to worry\r\nabout the Vice President reading _his_ letters? I wouldn’t have been\r\nsurprised if he had Gore’s private e-mail address. Just how many\r\nelectronic entreaties to the Hill, or to the Clinton-Gore area on the\r\nWeb, would it take to neutralize the little fortune donated by friends\r\nof West Publishing? I couldn’t have agreed more with Cliff Stoll when he\r\nwrote that Washington often ignored citizens’ e-mail. It all figured.\r\nThe Power People were too busy raising donations from millionaires and\r\npolitical-action committees—hardly the biggest champions of low-cost\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nGranted, some optimists hoped that the Internet itself could help turn\r\naround Washington. Aided by the Net, a group in Washington State had\r\ngathered $26,000 to help defeat Tom Foley, then the Democratic Speaker\r\nof the House. And NewtWatch, an anti-Gingrich effort on the World Wide\r\nWeb, had registered as a political-action committee. Some members of\r\nboth major parties were hoping to use the Net to raise money efficiently\r\nfrom small donors.[6.55]\r\n\r\nThat was far from a full answer, though. Even before I learned of all\r\nthe campaign cash from some members of the Advisory Council, I had\r\nwondered about the group’s odd composition. Not everyone on the council\r\nwas rich, of course, far from it. But why had business prevailed so\r\nbrazenly over the general public and Al Gore’s little neighbor back in\r\nTennessee, the one who was supposed to dial up books from the Library of\r\nCongress regardless of family income? Just one teacher and one\r\nlibrarian? In politer language I’d sent the question on to a White House\r\nstaffer, and he had patiently explained to me that Washington had to\r\nserve the needs of the “stakeholders.”\r\n\r\nI loved the word. It sounded so innocent, so natural, so philosophical.\r\nWhat if this were eighteenth-century France, the revolution were on, and\r\nMarie Antoinette looked like guillotine fodder? Armed with such a\r\nmarvelous locution, she could forego all references to bread and cake\r\nand simply say, “Stop! I’m one of the stakeholders.”\r\n\r\nNow having documented a nice flow of money from “stakeholders” to\r\npoliticians, especially Democrats, I remembered how many Watergate-era\r\nambassadorships had gone to the highest bidders. Wasn’t the same ethos\r\nat work here as Richard Nixon’s? I knew of no broken laws—but perhaps\r\nthat was the trouble.\r\n\r\n“I remember when I got on Energy and Commerce, everybody jumped for the\r\nTelecommunications Subcommittee first,” Peter Kostmayer, a former\r\nDemocratic representative from Pennsylvania, said as quoted by veteran\r\npolitical journalist Martin Schram. “There was a member sitting next to\r\nme, and every time another member bid for that committee, he went\r\n‘Ding!’—as if a cash register was going off.”[6.56] When politicians\r\ntalked about the need for election reform and clean, ethical government,\r\nmany were themselves superb examples of the need for action.\r\n\r\nMaybe, I’d thought earlier, I could at least enjoy an open-minded\r\nhearing from a nonmillionaire on the Advisory Council. Bonnie Bracey was\r\nthe only elementary school teacher. She should have loved TeleRead.\r\n\r\nBut during an official virtual conference organized on the Net by the\r\nCommerce Department, she went after not Opperman but _me_. “I am not the\r\nleast interested in the TeleReader,” she said in a public message, “and\r\nI don’t have any money after trying to do this job to invest anyway.” I\r\nwas and am a writer. Last I knew, I had not been selling computers.\r\nBracey needed to scrutinize my proposal. Maybe she could then dismiss it\r\nas a nefarious writer’s plot. TeleRead did, after all, propose a massive\r\nshifting of resources from bureaucracy to various forms of knowledge,\r\nincluding—_gasp!_—electronic _books_.\r\n\r\nAt times, Bracey would e-mail me that my proposal intrigued her, but\r\nsomehow she would never get around to _study_ it, or at least to telling\r\nme that she had gone beyond summaries. She would repeat the usual\r\nclichés that citizens didn’t want to spend money on schools. Toward\r\nTeleRead’s cost-justification mechanisms, toward the support that it\r\ncould win among frugal, business-oriented conservatives such as William\r\nBuckley, she was unresponsive. Granted, she wasn’t callous about the\r\nchildren TeleRead could help. At the personal level she had been\r\nexemplary, spending hundreds and perhaps thousands of dollars on\r\nhardware and software that she could use in her classes. But TeleRead\r\nfor her could have been a bother. Offensively, perhaps, it meant a\r\nnational library online for all, regardless of whether they happened to\r\nbe students anywhere.\r\n\r\nTeleRead, however, was hardly antischool, given all the new\r\npossibilities it could open up online for teachers and students. Looking\r\nback, I just wished that Bracey had seen a note I received from a\r\nteacher in Illinois who had asked more than sixty magazines for\r\npermission to reprint articles for her small class at no profit. Only\r\ntwenty-five publications had gone along. “We were ignored sometimes,”\r\nthe woman had e-mailed me, “and once I was told, by phone, never to use\r\nany articles from that publication. That was _Windows Magazine_, and I\r\ndidn’t renew my subscription.” Of her anthology, she had said: “It’s a\r\nbetter textbook because it’s more up to date.” Clearly we could never\r\nseparate “educational” uses of the NII from the rest; an article from a\r\ncommercial magazine could actually prove so much more valuable than an\r\ninstantly obsolete textbook. TeleRead would make back issues of\r\nmagazines available for free, make current ones easier to obtain, and,\r\nabove all, allow free textbooks to be updated instantly, complete with\r\nhypertext links to the rest of the national library.\r\n\r\nBut predictably the NII Advisory Council ignored TeleRead and more or\r\nless green-lighted the Green Paper. The council for the most part came\r\nout in favor of publishers enjoying control over transmission rights. In\r\neffect these people were kissing off the idea of a comprehensive,\r\ncost-justified library that all Americans could afford to use online,\r\nwhether for school or for self-improvement. As I was concluding this\r\nbook, it wasn’t certain that the Green Paper would slither its way into\r\nlaw in more or less the original form. But the news from Capitol Hill\r\ndidn’t cheer me. The Republican Congress appeared to be at least as\r\nskewed in favor of copyright holders as were the Democrats.\r\n\r\nEven diluted (and renamed the White Paper in the final version), the\r\nGreen Paper might well be a disgrace. I worried about the rest of the\r\nworld. Imagine the Australians or Europeans looking to the United States\r\nfor leadership in Net-related copyright matters. To me, the Green Paper\r\nbore the stains of greenbacks. People around D.C. had a polite little\r\nword, “access.” It didn’t mean legal violations, but rather purchases of\r\npolicymakers’ ears. Information magnates had access. I wondered if the\r\nlittle child in Al Gore’s hometown gave so faithfully to major\r\npoliticians, flew Supreme Court justices to Hawaii, and doled out\r\n$15,000 “justice” awards.\r\n\r\nThe Green Paper, alas, was just one indication of many big shots’\r\nwillingness to work against the citizenry. Again and again the denizens\r\nof Capitol Hill bragged about Americans being able to dial up the text\r\nof proposed legislation through a service called Thomas. And yet some\r\nCongress members still hoped to work out deals before the public saw the\r\nresults on the Net. Friends of West Publishing used exactly such tactics\r\non the Hill to try to reduce the amount of information that the\r\ngovernment released for free. West and similar companies wanted to be\r\nable to profit off public data. So their congressional allies were\r\nhoping to cancel out the Freedom of Information Act in cases where\r\nfederal contractors had created records.\r\n\r\nAny weakening of the act would make me _very_ grouchy; it had opened up\r\nmany kind of government information for free or at affordable costs. I\r\nhad benefited. Two decades ago the General Services Administration had\r\ntried unsuccessfully to charge me $20,000 to learn details about the\r\ngovernment’s office-leasing program. Using this first-class muck, I had\r\nshown that then-Senator Abraham Ribicoff secretly owned a stake in a\r\nbuilding that the GSA leased for the Central Intelligence Agency. I had\r\nlearned, too, of a friend of Spiro Agnew who had been able to avoid\r\nbuilding a half-million-dollar cafeteria required by the lease for the\r\nheadquarters building of the Environmental Protection Agency. Because of\r\nthe Information Act, I had been able to report both stories and get them\r\nout in the press and on network television. I had spent months camped\r\nout at the GSA, perusing documents; imagine what I could have done with\r\na computer to ferret out digitized muck. And so I was dismayed to learn\r\nthat some in Congress wanted to weaken the Information Act—this in an\r\nera when the Internet supposedly would open up Washington. If not fully\r\nOrwellian, such hypocrisy didn’t promote democratic alternatives to Big\r\nBrother.\r\n\r\nUppity activists used the Net to thwart West at least for the moment. A\r\nbill introduced by Representative William Clinger, a Republican from\r\nPennsylvania, was to be heard in a subcommittee and rushed through a\r\ncommittee edit in just a few days with West-friendly provisions. But\r\nJames Love of the Taxpayer Assets Project caught wind of the\r\nshenanigans; Jim Warren pitched in with his own jeremiads in _Government\r\nAccess_, his online newsletter; and furious Netfolks called and faxed\r\nthe Hill. West may have really lost when the Republicans found out\r\nthrough the Internet about the firm’s generosity toward the _Democratic\r\nParty_, to which its executives gave far more than to the competition.\r\n“Why are we doing this?” the Republicans, in effect, may have wondered.\r\n\r\nOnly because of some extraordinary diligence by Love and allies did the\r\npublic win here. Newt Gingrich could talk all he wanted about the Net\r\nputting citizens and lobbyists on an equal footing, but without a\r\nconstant watch on the Hill, scene of so many crimes, the same power\r\ncliques would keep winning again and again, banana-republic fashion.\r\nWest might yet succeed.\r\n\r\nAround this same time, Sally Katzen, a top bureaucrat with Clinton’s\r\nOffice of Management and Budget had asked Congress to make certain that\r\nthe Feds could charge more for information in some cases than the cost\r\nof spreading it. They would be able to do this after posting notices in\r\nthe _Federal Register_. And then, if insufficient protests ensued, the\r\ninfo-gouges could begin. Katzen’s proposal didn’t fly, but its very\r\nexistence was bothersome enough. The idea hardly jibed with all the nice\r\nrhetoric from the White House about using the Net to promote open\r\ngovernment. So much for freedom of information, Clinton style.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I forged ahead with my TeleRead efforts, perhaps not for this\r\nCongress and this White House, but maybe for those in the future—once\r\nenough voters understood that we mustn’t replicate online the “savage\r\ninequalities” of our schools and libraries. TeleRead if nothing else was\r\na handy litmus test to find out which policymakers were sincere when\r\nthey talked about the need for true public libraries in cyberspace, as\r\nopposed to just digital storefronts with links to publishers. Good\r\npeople could disagree with me. But when politicians and their flunkies\r\ndid not bother to hear me out despite my idea’s credentials, I was\r\nreminded of how democratic Washington was toward Power People and how\r\noligarchic it was toward the rest of the cosmos. Sometimes I felt that\r\nmy location, in Alexandria, Virginia, was metaphorical. My apartment was\r\njust inside the Washington Beltway.\r\n\r\nThe question of the moment wasn’t just one of copyright. It was also one\r\nof democracy itself, both the decision process and the aftermath. What\r\nabout the Copyright Gestapo? In the future might the Feds monitor the\r\nactivities of Republicans more closely than they would those of\r\nDemocrats? Would Republicans be more susceptible to charges of\r\nintellectual piracy when they did the inevitable and tried to share old\r\nnewspaper clips over the Net? Or vice versa? Would the Democrats suffer\r\ndiscrimination? What about Italy, where the machine-gun-toting cops had\r\ninvoked software piracy laws against leftist bulletin boards but not\r\nagainst conservative ones? But the Clintonians, so eager to serve their\r\npolitical friends, were just as cavalier toward these possibilities as\r\ntoward the civil liberties risk of Clipper.\r\n\r\nUltimately the copyright-holders’ victory just might be Pyrrhic. Someday\r\nthe political terrain could shift and millions of children might grow up\r\non free, government-commissioned books. Or, perhaps instead, videos in\r\ntoo many cases would replace text. So we were better off if, as soon as\r\npossible, we used networks to spread _privately_ originated books\r\nthrough a free, well-stocked library system. TeleRead could indeed help\r\nmany in the information industry. From Lexis-Nexis to Random House,\r\ncompanies could turn profits off dial-up fees, either from works they\r\ncommissioned directly or from rights they bought from authors. TeleRead\r\nwasn’t a threat to information companies if they truly added value such\r\nas editing or marketing. Even West could benefit. TeleRead would let\r\nOpperman’s company reap many millions off dial-up rights—not only to\r\nlegal writings but also to other kinds—if the market favored it.\r\n\r\nNo, the real losers would be the bureaucrats, whose work, after all,\r\nwould be less in demand in an era of electronic forms in mass use. And\r\neven they could have a soft landing. TeleRead would hardly take place\r\ninstantly, and it would remove much of the scut work from the remaining\r\njobs in government. TeleRead was anti-bureaucracy, not anti-bureaucrat.\r\nFor the moment, however, as shown by the obtuseness of the GSA man at\r\nthe hearing, the resistance was there.\r\n\r\nSome lessons were emerging. Hundreds of people had e-mailed me for\r\ncopies of TeleRead. “Even anti-taxers like me would be willing to foot\r\nthe bill for something so practical and knowledge infectious,” a home\r\nschooler in Illinois had said. The head of the Digital Publishing\r\nAssociation, an organization consisting mostly of small publishers and\r\nwriters, had loved TeleRead. “Instead of flooding the young mind with\r\nyet another sitcom or soap,” he had said, “TeleRead would allow video to\r\npresent them with quality reading materials.” And yet our wishes had not\r\nmeant squat.\r\n\r\nDavid Lytel, the White House staffer, may have pressed his delete key\r\nalmost as soon as the TeleRead proposal reached him over the Net. He and\r\nhis colleagues at the Lehman hearings hadn’t followed up my official\r\ntestimony with a single question in person or by phone or e-mail. The\r\nhearings had been a big farce, a caricature of a public relations\r\nexercise. I might as well have been Winston Smith deviating from the\r\nplot and making a few friendly suggestions to one of Big Brother’s TV\r\ncameras. No one would shoot or torture me for saying the wrong things,\r\nbut on the major NII issues the Clinton people were about as open as Big\r\nBrother to ideas from below, Net or no Net.\r\n\r\nI wasn’t the only writer with a few feelings on the subject of Executive\r\nlistening skills in this networked era. A _New York Times_ columnist\r\nlater told how cavalier the White House crowd had been toward the e-mail\r\nfrom her. I’d actually gotten farther than she had. At least Gore had\r\nsent me a higher class of boilerplate. Perhaps that was because I had\r\nactually used conventional rather than electronic mail, and had enclosed\r\na photocopy of a TeleRead article from the _Washington Post_. Article or\r\nnot, however, the White House had thumbed its nose at me. While Clinton\r\nand Gore couldn’t reply to every citizen, the composition of the\r\ncitizens’ advisory council had made clear what the NII priorities were,\r\neven in the age of Cyber Socks: Big Government serving Big Business.\r\n\r\nClinton-Gore had better change if they wanted my vote in ’96. Rather\r\nthan just sharing Sock’s meows and feeling ever so smug about high-tech\r\ndemocracy, they needed to spend time more listening to us nonlobbyists\r\nand a little less time keeping Vance Opperman happy. Democracy should\r\nnot mean just a dialogue between the White House and the usual\r\n“stakeholders.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs is obvious by now, intrusive government officials love to fixate on\r\nnet.sex. But something else is happening as shown in the next chapter:\r\nnet._love_. Let’s hope that Exon and company can tell the difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER\r\n                                 SEVEN\r\n\r\n    The Electronic\r\n    Matchmaker\r\n\r\n\r\nGregory Smith* had yet to kiss Susan Olson* good night or run his\r\nfingers through her hair. But he could do something else with his\r\nfingers: type to her. Greg was a library and information-management\r\nstudent in Adelaide in South Australia, she worked for a real estate\r\nfirm in Kansas City, Missouri, and they were carrying on a romance by\r\nway of the Internet. “We write letters constantly,” he said, “and\r\nexchange our thoughts on newspaper clippings, music, all manner of\r\nthings. About the only thing we haven’t exchanged are marriage vows.”\r\n\r\nThe outcome, as I began this chapter, wasn’t clear. If the Smith-Olson\r\naffair was like many on the Net, they would pull the plug long before\r\nall the typing destroyed their wrists. “For every good story,” Greg said\r\nof love on the Internet, “there are at least 100 bad stories—people\r\nmeeting and realizing there’s a major difference between virtuality and\r\nreality.” A few months later, I decided, I would check back in with Greg\r\nand Sue and report the results at the end of “The Electronic\r\nMatchmaker.”\r\n\r\nFor the moment I was optimistic. Greg and Sue had been at this for a\r\ngood two years; they spent several hours a day pouring out their\r\nthoughts to each other, Greg at his UNIX workstation, Sue at her lowly\r\nPackard Bell computer. He had bought her a diamond ring on a layaway\r\nplan; she was giving him a ring. She would fly Down Under at some point,\r\nand then the next summer, Greg would to go to Kansas City and meet Sue’s\r\nfamily, including her father, a retired auto worker who, ah, had a few\r\nsurprises ahead.\r\n\r\nI think of good people like Greg and Sue when I read the tacky, hacky\r\nstories about unhappy affairs online and Net sex. While many\r\npoliticians and reporters delve into the sleazier areas of the\r\nInternet—and, yes, regions can look like Silicon-era Sodoms—something\r\nwonderful is also happening on the Net. It’s connecting lovers with\r\nuncannily matched interests and values. Remember, the Internet teems\r\nwith more than 12,000 newsgroups. If you’re quirky and picky, if you\r\ninsist on a lover whose hobby is Esperanto, the international\r\nlanguage, try soc.culture.esperanto. If you want to find a fellow\r\nPeace Corps alumnus, you can choose from among several newsgroups and\r\nlists. If you’re a Libertarian stalwart and insist that your\r\ngirlfriend be nothing but—well, the search may take longer.\r\n\r\nSome philosophies just don’t hold out as much appeal to women as do\r\nothers. But that has not daunted a smart young Libertarian in\r\nCalifornia, Eric Klien, who started what may have been the Internet’s\r\nfirst matchmaking service, an operation later taken over by Electric\r\nClassifieds. Match.Com offers a long questionnaire that should appeal to\r\nmany of the detail-oriented habitués of the Internet.\r\n\r\nWhatever your taste, the Net probably has a dating service if that’s\r\nwhat you want. Operating with a French address on the World Wide Web,\r\nBabb’s Personals shows up with a photo of a green-eyed, dark-complected\r\nwoman, and a number of free, anonymous ads in French and English.\r\nChristie’s Internet MatchMaker claims to reach more than 14,000 users in\r\nseventeen cities. On the Net, too, you’ll find HIV Positive Dating\r\nServices (“Meet other positives, negatives, and neutrals locally,\r\nregionally, nationally, and even globally”), Web Personals (“Now over\r\n4,200 different visitors each day!”), and Virtual MeetMarket (“I believe\r\nthat the people who browse through here, and more importantly the people\r\nwho bother to publish personals here, are somewhat intelligent and\r\nInternet-savvy enough to know the difference between FTP and FTD—you\r\nknow, the flower delivery guys?”).\r\n\r\nI found some of the catchiest ads on Virtual. One showed a beautiful\r\ntwenty-five-year-old brunette in Los Angeles touching an empty set of\r\ncasual clothes labeled “Your picture here?” “I’m looking for somebody\r\nwho’s [_sic_] personality has a shelf life longer than a month,” she\r\nsaid, and California spelling notwithstanding, she clearly deserved just\r\nthat sort of person. A graduate student, hungering for a “sweet SWM of\r\nmy dreams,” inserted a picture of a knight in armor. Seeking “a\r\nScandinavian beauty,” a graphics designer from South Carolina posted an\r\nalmost magazine-quality layout with photos of himself and his cats and\r\neven an aerial shot of Charleston. The prose wasn’t the most\r\nimaginative, and his Scandinavian requirement was rather limiting, but\r\nin a flash the ad showed women what kind of life he could offer them.\r\nOther possibilities exist on the Web. Instead of just saying you like\r\ncertain musicians or artists, for example, you might write Web links to\r\ntake people to an area with sound or graphics files.\r\n\r\nThe best matchmaker is the Internet itself, with all its ways of\r\nbringing well-meaning people together. If Greg married Sue, this would\r\nhardly be the first Australian-American marriage born on the Net.\r\nAustralia is the e-mail capital of the universe, or at least the\r\nromantic regions thereof. Until surpassed by the United Kingdom and\r\nCanada, Australia had more Net connections than any country except for\r\nthe United States. Recently the Aussies’ telcom people started charging\r\ninstitutions for net connections according to the amount of use, and\r\nthat just might crimp future Gregs and Sues. But at least in mid-1995,\r\nAustralia’s e-mail laurels remain unthreatened.\r\n\r\nAmerican women love Australian men because they speak the same\r\nlanguage—more wittily than we Yanks do, of course—and because they all\r\ncarry huge knives with which they can defend their girlfriends against\r\ncrocodiles and muggers. Isn’t that so, just as in the movies? American\r\nmen worship Australian women because we know they are unappreciated down\r\non the sheep ranch, they’re literate, and have brilliant careers ahead\r\nof them. Don’t knock stereotypes if they help bring the right people\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe film _Crocodile Dundee_ may or may not have been on the mind of\r\nLaura Goodin when she was wandering through soc.culture.australian. She\r\nsaw “a message from an Australian composer studying in the U.S.,” who\r\ntold of “an alternative tune to ‘Waltzing Matilda.’” Laura asked for the\r\nmusic. Within months the Aussie proposed, right over the Net in the same\r\nnewsgroup. “Congratulatory messages came from all over the United\r\nStates, Australia, and New Zealand.” Today Laura Goodin and Houston\r\nDunleavy are married and living together in the Washington, D.C., area,\r\nwith a baby on the way. They exchanged more than 1,500 messages during\r\ntheir courtship, not to mention countless sessions of typing together in\r\nTeletype fashion, just as Greg and Sue have done. It is not the same as\r\ntalking the old-fashioned way but can save enough in phone bills to pay\r\nfor an engagement ring or maybe a more powerful computer. “A\r\nlong-distance relationship is hellish,” Laura says, “but the pain is\r\neased somewhat by the Internet.”[7.1]\r\n\r\nThis isn’t just happening on the Internet itself. When a New York City\r\nwoman was testing a service that became America Online, marriage was the\r\nlast thing on her mind. Nevertheless she ended up married in Virginia to\r\na lover she met via e-mail. Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio host,\r\nmet his wife on CompuServe, where, supposedly, she had sought his advice\r\non coping with a liberal professor. A chef and a substitute teacher met\r\non Prodigy and flew off to Las Vegas together, thinking they would enjoy\r\nthe video poker if nothing else; they won $4,000 and each other.[7.2]\r\n\r\nA psychiatrist has even written a novel about online relationships,\r\n_Virtual Love_. “E-mail has been called the singles bar of the 90’s,”\r\nDr. Avodah Offit told the _New York Times_. “And that concept intrigues\r\nme a lot. The traditional ways that people meet now do not allow much\r\naccess to each other’s minds, and that has not led to enduring\r\nrelationships.” What’s the best place to find out about your potential\r\nspouse? By sitting silently through movies or boozing it up in noisy,\r\nsmoky nightspots, or by sharing intimacies over the modem? “I find\r\npeople are more open on e-mail,” she says. And I agree.\r\n\r\nThe Internet, to be sure, is hardly a romantic nirvana, and although\r\nthis chapter will be positive about net romance for the most part, I’ll\r\nmix the praise with some lengthy warnings. Some sections of the Net will\r\nplease fundamentalist preachers no more than will the red-light areas of\r\nNew York or Calcutta. From alt.sex.bondage I called up a digitized photo\r\nfit for the Marquis de Sade. The caption accurately read, “Japanese girl\r\ntied to rack while master pours hot wax on her breast. Looks very\r\npainful and her face shows it.” Just about all of those posting to the\r\nforum are male despite the heterosexual orientation of the typical\r\nmessages. This area of the Net is about as woman friendly as _Hustler_.\r\nOffensively, too, the Internet also comes with sections devoted to\r\nbestiality, and, yes, discussion of adult-child sex. In every case, of\r\ncourse, society must distinguish between shared fantasies and real acts.\r\n(As indicated in chapter 6, Exonian laws aren’t the solution—parental\r\nvigilance and access-control software are.)\r\n\r\nA more serious worry, from the viewpoint of women hoping for romance on\r\nthe Internet, is the locker-room attitudes that can show up even in some\r\nrespectable areas. Consider the cause of this: the numbers.\r\n\r\nIf you go by one network veteran, fewer than one in twenty of the early\r\nNetfolks were female. By popular belief, maybe a tenth of the people on\r\nthe Net are female, a far smaller percentage than on other services such\r\nas Prodigy and America Online. The truth, however, is a bit more\r\ncomplicated. John Quarterman and Smoot Carl-Mitchell of Texas Internet\r\nConsulting, which regularly tracks the demographics of the Net, reported\r\nin the May 1995 issue of their publication _Matrix News_ that according\r\nto a survey in October 1994, 64 percent of Netfolks were male and 36\r\npercent female. And among educational institutions the percentage of\r\nfemales was as high as 41 percent. Borders between the Internet and\r\ncommercial services are breaking down Berlin Wall fashion, so you can\r\nexpect the Internet to show an increasing amount of female influence.\r\n\r\nThe old stereotype, however, that the Net is male dominated, would seem\r\nto hold up for the moment. Even the virtual dating services tend to have\r\nfar, far more men than women despite, in some cases, better terms for\r\nfemale customers.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for the ratios are world famous. Computers in the past were\r\nto girls what trucks and catchers’ mitts were also: the province of\r\nboys. Thousands of men in the computer industry are still oblivious to\r\nthe existence of another sex. When I write popular-level computer books,\r\nmale editors often demand that I stick to the technology rather than\r\nshow how _people_ use it. Most women, however, recoil from the Internet\r\nand other high tech unless they see practical reasons for bothering with\r\nUNIX commands and similar horrors; they have been raised to favor humans\r\nover gadgetry. Let’s hope that the old fears vanish as more women\r\nbefriend computers and programs grow easier for both genders.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, on some areas of the Internet, women can be treated\r\nlike females in Asian countries that pamper baby boys but all too often\r\nlet sickly girls die or even kill the fetuses. A few men ignore female\r\nNetfolks except for purposes of humiliation, sex, or combinations of the\r\ntwo. Although messages from women tend to draw more replies on the Net\r\nthan those from males, the end results can dismay; one man reportedly\r\nwelcomed a woman to a discussion group, launched a political dialogue,\r\nthen shifted in a nanosecond to a request for a swap of nude pictures.\r\nWomen tell of weirdoes stalking them via e-mail, flooding their Net\r\naccounts with unwanted messages. One victim, as reported in _Mother\r\nJones_ magazine, suffered “an untraceable e-mail ‘bomb’ containing\r\nhundreds of sexual and violent messages, the mildest of which was ‘Shut\r\nup bitch.‘”\r\n\r\nAt the same time women on the Internet can enjoy less of the sort of\r\nattention they desire. Some Netfolks don’t pay as much attention to the\r\npublic messages of women, and besides, female Internauts may not want to\r\npost anyway in some areas, given the outright insults and sarcasm that\r\nmay await them. Women seek harmony and compromise; much of the Net\r\nthrives on controversy.\r\n\r\nMy wife, who, like most of her gender on the Internet, hates flame wars,\r\nhas even run across a newsgroup whose people venture forth to start\r\narguments in other groups. What is a hobby to some men can be an\r\nantisocial practice to women. Many women hesitate to speak up on the\r\nNet, whatever the topic under discussion. Disturbing statistics come\r\nfrom Gladys We, a graduate student at Simon Fraser University in\r\nVancouver, Canada. Writing in the magazine _Virtual Culture_, she says\r\nat least four-fifths of several hundred postings to alt.feminism were by\r\nmen. She tallied figures almost as lopsided in soc.women. “Only in\r\nsoc.feminism,” We writes, “amid accusations of censorship, were there\r\ncomparable numbers of postings from women and men.”\r\n\r\nGiven the obstacles that women often face on the Internet, then, it is\r\namazing at times that _any_ romances happen there. When they do, yet\r\nanother danger arises—the risk of missed cues. A friendship online may\r\ncause either sex to ignore mismatched words and gestures that might put\r\nthem on guard. One Los Angeles women met her boyfriend on a BBS and\r\nsuffered a disaster that could just as well have happened by way of the\r\nNet. He got her pregnant, begged her not to abort, married her, and made\r\nlife a real hell, not just a virtual one, until they divorced.\r\n\r\nWorrisome, too, are the eternal tensions that go on in cyberspace\r\nbetween sincere Befrienders and not-so-sincere Gamesplayers, who the\r\nformer have trouble detecting. The Befrienders seek friends and lovers;\r\nthe Gamesplayers would just as soon toy with a human as hack a program.\r\nAn argument might even be made that high tech attracts more than its\r\nshare of people who thrive on impermanence. You do not last long in\r\ncomputers if you believe that Pentium-level chips are forever, or that\r\n28.8K-bps modems are more than throwaway technology in the general\r\nscheme of things. Faster chips, higher speed modems, and new girlfriends\r\nor boyfriends are sure to come along. That’s the mind-set. Let’s just\r\nhope that the girlfriends and boyfriends will last.\r\n\r\n“I am burning with a need to talk with you, to share with you my fears,\r\nmy joys,” one Australian women cooed via modem to a man in the Canadian\r\nprovince of Alberta. Within two weeks her ardor did not just cool, it\r\ninexplicably froze. “This is the very last time I will write to you,”\r\nshe said. Very possibly—we can’t say for sure without ESP—the Australian\r\nwoman was a Gamesplayer.\r\n\r\nGamesplayers enjoy at least one big advantage on the Internet. They can\r\npost their electronic want ads through computers, known as anonymous\r\nservers, that strip their names and other compromising identifiers.[7.3]\r\nAnd replies can come through anonymous servers. The same technology used\r\nto protect privacy can let Gamesplayers fool victim after victim, and\r\neven mask genders. Particularly in fantasy games on the Net you can\r\nnever be sure if you’re typing to a woman or a man who just wants more\r\nattention—abusive or not. What’s more, for the skillful there are ways\r\nto forge messages to unsuspecting neophytes.\r\n\r\nAnother negative is that the Net can be as helpful to adulterers as to\r\nthe moral and sincere. A techie has just poured out to me a story of the\r\nkind that Carson McCullers would have written if she had fixated on the\r\nInternet rather than on the American South. His wife, the mother of two\r\nchildren, has been using the Net to cheat on him in a massive way. She\r\nbefriended two alcoholics by way of her modem, the marriage counselor\r\nsays he has done all he could, and now comes word that she just might\r\nhave the AIDS virus; I hear it’s too early for a conclusive HIV test.\r\n\r\nIf sexual excitement is the only goal of _certain_ Netfolks, and if the\r\ncrowd in alt.sex.wanted is too creepy, some professional women just\r\nmight meet their needs. As noted earlier in this book, a little outfit\r\ncalled Brandy’s Babes advertised on the World Wide Web—complete with\r\nhints of more than just visual stimuli. The babes are apparently off the\r\nNet now, but some would say that successors are inevitable. In _limited_\r\nways the Net and the world of professional sex are much alike: both have\r\ntheir jargon and, for those who seek it, their anonymity.\r\n\r\nBoth worlds are rich in eccentrics. For example, I recently ran across a\r\nwoman in her late forties who was about to bear a baby with a computer\r\nscientist she met on the Net “an hour before April Fool’s Day.” She says\r\nthe child was accidentally “conceived about two weeks after meeting ‘in\r\nthe flesh.’ We are having the baby first. _Then_ we will talk about\r\nmarriage on a serious basis. I’m delighted at the prospect of being a\r\nmum at last, and I am not your average clunky woman at all. I generally\r\nfeel much better about myself. I introduced Tom to sex, and he says he\r\nhad no idea how cuddle-deprived he was. He’s now quite addicted to me.”\r\nTom and his computer are now part of her household; like many Netfolks\r\nhe can use his modem to work virtually anywhere, which in some cases is\r\nyet another advantage of online romance.\r\n\r\nLike most denizens of the Internet, the e-mail lovers just mentioned are\r\nwell educated. And, although the woman was between jobs, Netfolks are\r\nnormally at least affluent. If they are students, their parents are\r\nmiddle class or better. While the price of Internet service is coming\r\ndown, and while access is free in some cities and at many American\r\ncolleges, the Net doesn’t exactly teem with welfare mothers.\r\n\r\nSo what other patterns emerge among lovers who meet through the Net? “I\r\nhaven’t done a study of the personality curve, the introvert-extrovert\r\nratio,” Avodah Offit, the psychiatrist who wrote _Virtual Love_, told\r\nme, “but my experience is just the opposite of what one might expect My\r\n‘high user’ contacts are all very sociable types who hate being out of\r\ncontact with others at any time of day or night. Of course my\r\ncorrespondents are not generally engaged in romance with me, but they do\r\nwrite to others online in a variety of relationships.” My own\r\nobservations suggest that while many net.lovers may be introverts, her\r\nthoughts would hold true.\r\n\r\nJudging from lovers whose photos I’ve seen, the plugged-in couples are\r\nneither more nor less attractive than the world at large. But the\r\nplainer ones can use prose to compensate for looks; this is a medium\r\nwhere words are everything.\r\n\r\nI hope that the people’s love letters don’t just vanish, because the\r\noutput of _some_ Netfolks can be charmingly Victorian in style, feeling,\r\nor sheer volume. “My family took it pretty hard at first and were a bit\r\nskeptical, especially my Mum,” says an Australian college student who\r\nfell in love with an American more than a decade older than she is, ”but\r\nthen I gave them some of the early letters to read, a pile of 100, the\r\nonly ones I had time to print out, and the next day my mother came up to\r\nme and said, ‘I am very happy for you. I am glad you have Frank.’ I was\r\nwaiting for the ‘But,’ but it never came.” A New England woman, who\r\nmarried a fellow clarinet player she met on the Internet, says he once\r\nshowed her a $1,000-plus telephone bill. That’s Love, capital L. Maybe\r\nthe nineteenth century is alive in some quarters, whatever the medium,\r\nvoice or e-mail.\r\n\r\nBelow I’ll tell stories of Greg and Sue; a bachelor who was looking for\r\na woman who wouldn’t treat him like “a peripheral”; and a man who, to\r\nhis distress, found himself cuckolded more easily because his wife was\r\non the Net.\r\n\r\nGreg and Sue\r\n\r\nAdelaide was where Greg Smith majored in library studies at the\r\nUniversity of South Australia. It was a graceful port and state capital\r\nwith a Mediterranean climate, a population of a million, the Torrens\r\nRiver in the center, and swarms of college students from three schools.\r\nNamed for Queen Adelaide, the wife of England’s King William IV, the\r\ncity dated back to the 1830s. Kangaroos still hopped around in the\r\ncountryside, but Adelaide itself was both urban and urbane. It was full\r\nof churches and bars alike, along with trendy shops in Rundle Mall and\r\nelsewhere. The State Theater put on Shakespearean plays at an\r\ninternationally known festival center.\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, Adelaide has been described as the Boston of South\r\nAustralia. While some young locals may shrug off the place as too\r\nchurchy and sleepy, others might disagree. Adelaide in many ways is a\r\nyoung person’s town—a good place to meet the opposite sex. Greg Smith,\r\nin fact, did find women in the corporeal world around him, but the\r\nrelationships never took root, and in the early 1990s he was still on\r\nthe lookout in the bars (“universities are great for this”), the parks,\r\nthe buses, the mall—you name it. He had his attractions. Greg, in fact,\r\nwas on the handsome side, if you went by the digitized photo and other\r\ninformation conveyed over the Net. He stood six-foot four, weighed\r\naround 190, kept in shape by walking, and had thick, dark brown hair,\r\nand a winsome smile.\r\n\r\n“I’m a physical person,” Greg told me. “I like to be with people. I like\r\n‘reading’ people for body language and all that.” From the very start he\r\nwas aware of the perils and limitations of the Internet in such areas as\r\nlove. You had to trust the words of strangers, not sharing their own\r\nreality. “Relationships are established where one party is totally\r\nsincere and all that, and the other one is just getting a laugh out of\r\nit.” Just the same, he could not resist touring the Internet and the\r\nbulletin board to which his international connections led.\r\n\r\nYoung people like Greg Smith, who sought out new places on the Net,\r\nwhether bulletin boards or electronic libraries, were vaguely like the\r\nJack Kerouacs of the ’50s who liked bumming around the United States for\r\nits own sake. Some would describe the high-tech Kerouacs as “net\r\nsurfers.” But the phrase “net surfing” has become so trivialized in the\r\nmedia that perhaps we should return to the Kerouac analogy.[7.4]\r\n_Kerouing_, not surfing. Stark differences, of course, existed between\r\nthe international Internet and the American towns of _On the Road_, the\r\nfamous Kerouac novel. Greg had spent some time in the United States when\r\nhe was ten years old and loved to keep up with American sports, but he\r\nwas very much a creature of Australia, with a distinctly Aussie flavor\r\nin his accent and values. Nor was he a rebel in the true Kerouac\r\ntradition. You could be a library science major and still soak up the\r\nculture of the Net; you didn’t have to hop on and off freight trains and\r\nrisk poverty or a severed leg.\r\n\r\nIn fact, while hooked into an established institution such as a\r\ncorporation or a university, you just might do better than if you had to\r\nbuy all the gadgetry yourself—just so you didn’t flunk out while you\r\nwere partaking. A _teacher_ might even encourage your wanderings. And\r\nthat was how Greg ended up on the Net for the first time in 1992. He\r\nfound himself logging onto electronic bulletin boards all over the\r\nplanet, with bizarre names such as “Badboy’s Better BBS System” or\r\n“Chatsubo.” He was at least partly drawn to such places because they\r\nwere so much like neighborhoods or small towns. Each came with its own\r\nset of friendships, love affairs, and feuds that could reach an\r\nintensity even greater than those on the discussion areas of the main\r\nNet.\r\n\r\nThe woman who married Rush Limbaugh is said to have exchanged tart words\r\nwith Limbaugh on CompuServe at the start of their relationship, and the\r\nsame happened with Greg and Sue. They did not attempt an\r\nalt.personals-style romance. Via Chatsubo he and she were just patterns\r\nof dots on each other’s cathode ray tubes. In fact, the two even butted\r\nheads over the question of whether certain people were abusing computer\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nSue, it should be noted, was not a true technophile; she could fire up a\r\nmodem and use easy UNIX commands and that was about it. Even so, the two\r\nshared much else. Greg was around twenty at the time, just a year or so\r\nolder than she was. Sue was a college student, at Northwestern Missouri\r\nState University. “I like her intensity, her sarcastic wit, her humor,\r\nand her, I dunno, just her way of seeing things,” Greg would say of the\r\nSue he came to know. “Politically we’re very similar, as regards\r\npolitical policy and all that. Our tastes in music are close. Our\r\npleasures are drawn from simple, similar things. For example, we are\r\nboth mad about long walks, NFL football, curling up in front of fires,\r\nwalking in the mall, playing in the rain, and on and on it goes.” Sue\r\nhad been thinking about teaching, among other possible careers\r\n(political work and diplomacy happened to be others), and she enjoyed\r\nmuseums. Greg’s father had taught Shakespeare once, and his mother had\r\nalso been a teacher. So while nothing Oedipal was at work here, Greg\r\nmight well be more comfortable with a woman who shared familiar\r\npriorities.\r\n\r\nJust as important, both Greg and Sue could breeze along on a keyboard\r\nand say _plenty_ online. In the near future, people might be able to\r\nspeak into a microphone with those at the other end seeing words pop up\r\non the screen, but for the moment the Net was friendliest to good\r\ntypists, especially those who could write well, as Greg and Sue could.\r\nThey could almost be playwrights, the way they loved stage directions\r\nsuch as “Hugs” and “Wave good-byes.” If a feeling occurred to either,\r\nthey could transfer it from their brain cells to the keyboard and make\r\nthe recipient _see_ their thoughts. When Sue sent a letter to Greg and\r\nme, it was obvious she wanted to get back to her private correspondence\r\nwith him. She ended her note: “*hugs greg* hold your horses sweetie, I’m\r\ntyping as fast as I can :-).” I could see that techie or not, Sue felt\r\nat home at the computer keyboard.\r\n\r\nWithout trying to woo each other across fourteen time zones, the two\r\nfriends grew closer as they made the rounds of the BBSs on the Net. One\r\nof the boards carried a gallery of digitized photos, and Greg enjoyed\r\nSue’s face. The look was American-Midwestern. Her light blonde hair\r\nflowed in a way that must have pleased him.[7.5] She had green eyes\r\nbroken up with what she has described as a “strange shade of yellow.”\r\nThe skin was pale, the Scandinavian in her. In one of the shots she\r\nposed with a knee resting on a well-padded armchair. She wore a\r\ncrocheted sweater, pants, and flats, and looked sexy but in a fresh,\r\nfriendly way that would not have threatened a schoolteacher’s son. Greg,\r\nin turn, pleased Sue; in fact, even more so later on when she learned of\r\nhis height; she herself stood five-feet ten and favored tall men.\r\n\r\nSue especially relished his sense of humor. “I could log in after a\r\ntotally crappy day in classes and I’d have some corny e-mail from Greg\r\nthat would send a smile to my face no matter what I felt like. He was,\r\nstill is, and probably will be, the only person who can really cheer me\r\nup no matter what the circumstances are.” Love, however, just wasn’t on\r\nthe minds of Greg and Sue in those early days. She had family and\r\nfriends in Kansas City and counted on braving the frigid Missouri\r\nwinters while she went to college. Meanwhile she had experienced her\r\nshare of romances off the Net, including one with a shy friend who\r\nhelped introduce her to the online world by suggesting that they _type_\r\nto each other. Sue may or may not have been ready for yet another\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\nEven if she and Greg were just friends, they were paving the way for\r\nsomething more by slowly trading secrets about themselves. Lois Shawver,\r\na California psychologist often online, warned me of the lack of trust\r\nthat can afflict many long-distance relationships via computer. And yet\r\nparadoxically, the Net could bring people closer to each other. “It’s so\r\neasy to end a relationship,” Shawver told me, “you simply stop\r\ncorresponding.” So “people seem to be more willing to take a chance and\r\ndisclose intimately. That helps to create trust. I do think that also\r\nexplains the medium’s ability to help people bridge cultural gaps.” It\r\nwas all certainly true in the case of Sue and Greg.\r\n\r\nHelpful, too, was the emphasis that they placed on the platonic at the\r\nstart, without even meaning to do so. Is it just possible that horny\r\nyoung men and women on the Internet and elsewhere could declare a\r\none-year moratorium on the raunchier forms of “cybersex” where men and\r\nwomen exchanged lewd remarks with each other, Teletype fashion, in group\r\nsettings? Ditto for the online world’s many homosexuals and bisexuals.\r\nIronically the aftermath might be _more_ sex and better sex after some\r\ntrue friendships developed by way of electronic mail and one-to-one\r\nchats. One test of friendship, of course, might be this: Would a couple\r\nstill write to each other if their Net connection ended? And Sue and\r\nGreg had passed so far: Her Internet account had vanished after she left\r\nNorthwestern Missouri State University to work and go to school\r\npart-time. She ended up at an insurance company. Letters written on\r\npulped trees, comic strips, editorial cartoons, music cassettes,\r\nmaterial of all kinds, had traveled between Australia and Missouri. “We\r\ngot closer and closer with each postage stamp,” Sue told me, “and\r\nbelieve me, there were a bunch. The post office likes me a _lot_.”\r\nFinally, however, Sue had returned to the Net, this time with a private\r\naccount\r\n\r\nOn August 7, 1994, she had to break off an online chat to leave for\r\nwork. “And I had one more question for her,” Greg recalled. “She asked\r\nwhat it was. And I asked her plain and simple, ‘Will you marry me?’\r\nThere was a pause of about thirty seconds, and she asked me if I was\r\nserious. I said, ‘Yes, never more so,’ and she said ‘Yes.’” Sue let her\r\nmother and a sister in on what was happening. She told certain friends,\r\ntoo, but not her brother and father. “It’s just going to be\r\nincomprehensible to them,” Greg told me, “that this could happen over a\r\nchunk of cable. Add to that I’m stealing away their last child, not just\r\nout of the home, or the state, but out of the country, and I can\r\nunderstand why her father is not going to understand.”\r\n\r\nThe same shocks would presumably await Greg’s mum and dad. “I think it’s\r\nmore the medium than anything else. It’s way new to them, but for me\r\nit’s just part of the way we do things now. *Grin*. Mum’s department\r\njust got Lotus’ cc:Mail,[7.6] and she was telling me about it and I was\r\nlike ‘Yeah, so?’ but she was really excited about it.” Although Greg did\r\ntalk to Sue from home, not just his university, he could do so without\r\nhis parents knowing, because of the late hours he keeps, and because he\r\nlived in a converted shed out back of his house. I pondered the ironies\r\nhere. Suddenly the Internet held out a new peril for parents. Having\r\nfretted about electronic pornography, Mom and Dad could now worry about\r\nchildren with more noble but equally secret activities. Parents might\r\nerase porno from a hard drive; it was not so easy to wipe out love as\r\nsincere and intense as Greg and Sue’s.\r\n\r\nBut had the two actually _talked_, telephone style, over a real phone?\r\n“We’ve had a grand total of one phone call,” Greg told me. Sue dialed\r\nhim up. He said she’d kept putting it off because she was scared. “I\r\nknow, I know,” he wrote, “we should talk more but I’m just a poor\r\nstudent.” Greg inserted the computer symbol for a smile to show he was\r\nkidding. “The one thing that surprised me about that call was how\r\nnaturally the conversation flowed. I think it came from the fact that we\r\nare friends first and a couple second—that the pressure of the\r\nrelationship was negated by the fact that we are such good friends. I\r\nseem to recall impressions more than anything else, like the lilt of her\r\nlaugh, the timbre of her voice, the accent. We just talked about\r\nstuff—us, love, Clinton’s screwups in Congress, sports, everything. Very\r\ntough to put the phone down.”\r\n\r\n“Still,” I asked Sue by telephone, “won’t it be quite a transition from\r\nthe American Midwest to Australia?”\r\n\r\nIn a friendly, steady voice she told how she had overcome her\r\nhesitations. When Sue toured the local museums now, she saw graffiti on\r\nstatues, and she said the neighborhoods were slipping. I thought of my\r\ngrandmother’s old place in Kansas City years ago, how it had been\r\nblock-busted by sleazes who frightened the whites away and resold the\r\nhouses at handsome profits to Afro-Americans. Hotrods had roared up and\r\ndown Chestnut Street; Grandma had been the last white holdout. The\r\nmemory still enraged me. Although I hadn’t been to Kansas City in years,\r\nI believed Sue.\r\n\r\n“My brother and sister are quite a bit older than I am,” she went on,\r\n”and they both have children of their own, and I’m not crazy about the\r\nidea of leaving them to know their aunt through phone calls and video\r\ntapes. But I have no intention of staying in the Midwest just for my\r\nfamily’s sake.\r\n\r\n“It’s my life and what I want to do requires more than the Midwest has\r\nto offer. I can fit in well wherever I go. And I’ve gotten a few books\r\non Oz. From what I’ve read, I’ll like Australia just as long as I don’t\r\nhave to wear one of those damn hats and worship Paul Hogan. I have Greg\r\nto worship. They may drive on the wrong side of the road and drink beer\r\nwith lunch, but it’s not like I’ll have to learn a whole new language.”\r\nBesides, she loved the idea of the children growing up with an accent as\r\ndelightful as the one she heard from Greg.\r\n\r\nI asked Greg if his virtual romance with Sue had changed him. “It’s\r\nrelieved a lot of the pressure that exists between myself and women,\r\nbecause it’s no longer that I’m looking for something more than\r\nfriendship—I have a relationship which satisfies those needs and so\r\ndon’t need anything from those friendships. What is most interesting is\r\nthat change that I haven’t picked up but that other women must have. In\r\nthe two-and-a-half years I’ve been at the university, I’ve been ‘hit on’\r\na grand total of zero times that I can remember. In the twenty days or\r\nso that I’ve been engaged, I’ve been hit on three times. And for the\r\nlife of me, I can’t figure out exactly what is making women see me as\r\nattractive. And they weren’t friends or acquaintances either—completely\r\nunknown to me. Weird.”\r\n\r\nSo how much had Greg changed Sue? “A lot,” she e-mailed back. Sue said:\r\n“Being with Greg has taught me, if anything else, that my life doesn’t\r\nhave any boundaries, be they physical or emotional or geographic.” This\r\nwas more than lover’s mush; I noticed her use of “With Greg,” as if they\r\nwere in the same room.\r\n\r\nAsked for love letters—no pressure, let me emphasize—the two obliged\r\nwith thousands of words just from their August 1994 writings alone.\r\nMostly the letters were from Sue whose feelings were more conveniently\r\npreserved in digital form than were the letters from Greg. He wasn’t\r\nholding back: He was the one who had contacted me about their romance.\r\nWhat followed from Sue was more affecting than anything I’d read in a\r\nnovel, for it was real, and I learned about it in the same way that Greg\r\ndid, through a series of pixels on a computer screen. Reading this one\r\nmessage would help explain why she was willing to leave Kansas City; why\r\nshe felt that, regardless of a father with heart trouble, she had felt\r\nfree to move on; perhaps even why she was willing to share her life so\r\nopenly with me through this book, for a chronicle was an affirmation of\r\nsorts.\r\n\r\nNew to me but old to Greg, the revelation did not come immediately.\r\nSue’s August letters started out mainly with the routine, the glue of\r\nlong-range relationships, the confirmation that she wanted Greg to know\r\nher life and likes. There was talk of food (“I love you more than I love\r\nmunching on peanut butter and crackers”), diets (“I splurged on Chinese\r\nand probably regained the three pounds I lost”), art (at the Nelson\r\nmuseum she favored the impressionists), friends’ babies (“Barbara went\r\nto the doctor this morning to check and see how the baby was doing—she\r\nwas about ten weeks along, and she had a miscarriage”), school (Sue was\r\nattending community college and could not resist sharing a few\r\nunabashedly corny jokes about her anatomy course), places to go on\r\nvacation (“Hey,” she said, in a discussion of Mount Rushmore, “do you\r\nAussies get weird and chisel the faces of dead leaders onto\r\nmountainsides, or is that a distinctly American thing to do?”), and jobs\r\n(“this working full time and college at night is starting to wear me\r\ndown a bit, but for the time being it’s what I want to do”).\r\n\r\nLike almost any woman she _planned_. The word was that Greg should wrap\r\nsome paper around his fingers and snip it off at the right place and\r\nsend the results on to her so she’d know the size of his ring. And\r\nshould it be silver or gold? They discussed pajamas. “I always thought\r\nit would be cool to share a pair of PJs with someone,” Sue wrote. “I’d\r\nwear the tops, you’d get the bottom. Okay, so I’m cheesy, but I guess\r\nit’s the American upbringing :). Shrug.” In her mind Sue saw the “really\r\ncool chapel in Rapid City, South Dakota, where my grandparents on dad’s\r\nside renewed their vows for their fiftieth wedding anniversary.” “I\r\nwanna get married in it,” she wrote Greg. “There’s a place where you can\r\nlight a candle for a loved one and say a prayer to keep them safe. Well,\r\nI lit a candle for Barbara, and then I lit one for us. It felt weird to\r\nbe in a church for a good reason. Seems that all the last ones have been\r\nfor funerals.”\r\n\r\nAnother close friend had died some time back, and she reflected on the\r\nconnection between that and a period of heavy activity on the bulletin\r\nboard circuit. “When I logged on, I could just be some faceless\r\nperson—no one had to know that my best friend was in the hospital room\r\nsemicomatose because he had developed full-blown AIDS. There were so\r\nmany people in my life that just up and left because Ralph* got sick; it\r\nwas almost as if I had AIDS just by association. So I got online and\r\nbecame everyone’s favorite sweetheart.”\r\n\r\nThen a signal fact emerged in the correspondence, something that\r\nexplained who Sue was, and why Sue felt like Sue, although I believed\r\nthat she and Greg would have wanted to be together even if her\r\ncircumstances had been different. “I had just found out,” she told him,\r\n“that I had won a fight against a terminal illness while Ralph was\r\nlosing his. I don’t talk about the fact that I am a cancer survivor very\r\nmuch, because I haven’t been in remission that long. It will be two\r\nyears in September.\r\n\r\n“All I want to do is make it to the five-year mark and forget the pain\r\nand the tears and the chemo and the treatments,” the letter said. “I\r\nwant to look forward and be able to see a future without constant trips\r\nto the hospital, to days and nights when I can just be healthy and\r\nhappy. I have a tendency to block out when I was sick because if I don’t\r\nthink about it, I don’t remember it, and if I don’t remember it, I don’t\r\nworry about it coming back. If you ask, I will tell you everything.”\r\nVery early on in their friendship, Greg had known that the cancer was\r\ncervical; any children would have to be adopted. Sue ended the message\r\nby assuring him that she no longer wanted “the foreign policy degree\r\nfrom Georgetown anymore, or the chance to have the President asking my\r\nopinion on things.” Her goal now was Greg, an affordable flat, and a\r\nroomful of kids to teach.\r\n\r\nThe rest of her letters went on to discuss such cosmic questions as\r\nSue’s love of long showers in the mornings, her tendency to roll around\r\na little in her sleep, and Greg’s hatred of his cataloguing duties.[7.7]\r\n“I love love love love love you,” he wrote, and heated up the wires some\r\nmore while he and Sue dreamed of hugs at the airport, unstoppable\r\npassion, and a wedding.\r\n\r\n“Know,” he told her, “that there’s a goofy, tall, dark, Australian,\r\nmadly-in-love man here dreaming of you, and us, and the future.” I was\r\nbetting right now that they’d make it to that South Dakota church.\r\n\r\nLee Chen: The Lover as a Peripheral\r\n\r\nHe was a hacker, a true denizen of the Internet, and a poet at times.\r\nA word in one poem told all: “peripheral.” It means a printer, a\r\nmodem, a scanner, or any other gadget that plugs into the main\r\ncomputer, yet is not one of the _very_ most important parts. And\r\nthat’s how some women on the Net saw him, the human equivalent of a\r\nprinter, someone on the peripheries of their minds. He was among their\r\nfriends but not their lovers. His own love went unreturned. So he\r\ncalled his poem “Song of a Peripheral”; he posted it to alt.romance,\r\nsoc.couples, alt.support.loneliness, and alt.support.shyness. It read,\r\nin part:\r\n\r\n _You feel you’re nothing special in her life.\r\n You never get a sense that she wants you to be close to her.\r\n You’re just a pleasant, polite friend around the periphery of her world.\r\n But you still care for her, because she is that special woman—_\r\n\r\n _A sweetest heart who cares for the well-being of others.\r\n A most sensuous soul who is full of life and passion.\r\n And a beautiful intellect who brings realist precepts to balance out\r\n    those disillusions in the world._\r\n\r\n _... It’s painful to feel you’re just a Peripheral, isn’t it?_\r\n\r\n“How could I _not_ print part of ‘Song’ in this chapter,” I thought, and\r\nwrote Lee Chen for permission. Back came a letter from the Department of\r\nComputer Science at the University of Calgary in Canada. People on the\r\nInternet love to end messages with “signatures” telling how they see the\r\ncosmos, and Lee had picked a quote that looked as gentle and logical as\r\nhis poem. The speaker was the President of the United States in the\r\nmovie _Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Start Worrying and Love the\r\nBomb_. And the words went, “You can’t fight in here, this is the War\r\nRoom.”\r\n\r\nSometimes I thought that in the battle of the sexes, certain areas of\r\nthe Internet could be that war room. No man could claim to be a\r\nsuperhunk or millionaire without risking a female retort in the vein of,\r\n“Yeah, sure.” The Net was rich with put-downs worthy of an old\r\nTracy-Hepburn movie. Clearly the men had started this war, however.\r\n“When a female shows up,” said the author of an explanatory file on\r\nalt.sex.wanted, “clueless folks tend to e-mail ‘wanna fuck’ messages no\r\nmatter _what_ she has said. This means many of them don’t post, only\r\nlisten.” Fights had also broken out between the gays and certain\r\nheterosexuals, who came up with the witless fag jokes, and who, in turn,\r\nhad drawn equally stupid remarks about “breeders.” In this sexual war,\r\nthe biggest losers were SMHGs. That was Netspeak for Straight Male Horny\r\nGeeks, who, as noted earlier, suffered from the laws of supply and (lack\r\nof) demand.\r\n\r\nLee Chen was an SMHG in a nice way. His style had been to try in\r\nalt.personals rather than one of the tackier areas. When Lee had placed\r\na recent ad, he had described himself as “a romantic dreamer,” and he\r\nwanted “a single woman between the ages of nineteen and thirty-three who\r\nis sincere, intelligent, attractive,” and “passionate” as well. Lee was\r\ntwenty-six and entitled to feel his age. Moreover, based on his\r\nself-description, women would have no more reason to run away from him\r\nthan they did from Greg Smith in _his_ lonely days.\r\n\r\n“I’m five feet eleven inches, 185 pounds, have dark brown eyes and short\r\nblack hair,” Lee said. “And I’m a healthy, disease-free nonsmoker and\r\nconsidered attractive looking.” He told me he held a master’s in\r\ncomputer science, was continuing his studies, and obviously was destined\r\nto earn a comfortable living at the very least. Lee enjoyed “going out\r\nto movies and romantic dinners, discussing current events and politics,\r\nvisiting museums and natural parks, walking along the rivers, listening\r\nto various kinds of music, giving and receiving pleasures with a\r\nsensuous partner.” So far, however, Lee lacked a woman—he was new in\r\ntown. Maybe a minor part of his problem, at least among females off\r\ncampus, was the kind of place that Calgary was. He saw it as “a cowboy\r\ncity, big in the oil business, very similar to Dallas culturally, except\r\nfor the cold winter climate.” This particular SMHG might have felt more\r\ncomfortable in a more intellectually minded city such as Boston or San\r\nFrancisco. But he was no snob and still held out hope of meeting one of\r\nthe locals rather than confining the search to university people (“I’m\r\nsure there are many wonderful women in this town”). Simultaneously he\r\ndecided to try the Net.\r\n\r\nThe first time out with a personal ad, Lee heard from a woman in, yes,\r\nAustralia—E-Mail Central. Dozens of love letters threatened to melt down\r\nany fiber-optics on the Net; in fact, she sent Lee her erotic poetry and\r\nencouraged him to reply with the same. Through it all, he was high\r\nminded. “I believe in the mutual respect between women and men,” he\r\nsaid, “but am also saddened by the gradual decline of romantic chivalry\r\nin our society. I feel they don’t need to be mutually exclusive.” His\r\npoet in Australia seemed to feel the same. Within a month she promised\r\nto fly to Canada.\r\n\r\n“My darkest knight, my love,” she called him. She was “burning with a\r\nneed to talk with you, to share with you my fears, my joys. I ache to be\r\nable to brush a falling raindrop from your cheek and hold your handsome\r\nface close to my heart. I miss you already though we have not met.”\r\n\r\nThis woman could have been crafting bodice-rippers for Harlequin Books.\r\n“I thrive on every word that falls from your sensuous lips,” she wrote\r\nLee. “I feel I am being too bold for a lady of my breeding, but what I\r\nfeel has gone from my control before I was aware of my feelings.” More\r\nletters followed, more fire, more steam. And then, out of nowhere: “This\r\nis the very last time I will write to you. You have to leave me alone.\r\nAny future mail you send me will remain unanswered. We do not know each\r\nother. Words across a net aren’t a firm basis of a relationship and it\r\ntakes time to form a friendship. We have neither and I cannot currently\r\ngive either to you. I have strong personal commitments at the moment\r\nthat leave me unable to commit to anyone, especially a man in a romantic\r\nway. Please understand. It may have been special and beautiful, but it\r\nhas to be over. One day I may be in a position to explain further, but\r\ncurrently I cannot. I apologise once more and wish you well in your\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe,” Lee looked back, “it was just a game for her.” And, no dummy,\r\nhe had learned from such experiences. Nowadays Lee was wary of anonymous\r\naddresses with low numbers that suggested their owners had been cruising\r\nalt.personal for a long time.\r\n\r\nHe had also learned of the usefulness of friendship as a prelude to\r\nlove. “Of all those ladies who answered my original personal,” he said,\r\n“only one is still corresponding as a friend.” Another female friend was\r\nalso in his life online, somebody he met in an unrelated newsgroup. She\r\ntyped out an popular opinion and he wrote in to agree, and they found\r\nthey shared interests. But neither saw romance immediately ahead. Nor\r\nwas that true of the other friendships he had online. Although vague\r\nabout them, he suggested that he was still on the periphery.\r\n\r\nReached some months later, Lee told me he had gone on to befriend “quite\r\na few nice women around this campus.” In person and on the Net, however,\r\nhe had yet to meet just the right one for those river walks, museum\r\ntours, and “giving and receiving pleasure.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sorry, David,” Lee said, “but I didn’t have a happy ending. I‘m\r\nsure there are some people who actually find their true loves this way.\r\nAlthough I didn’t find true love, I’ve found many sincere friendships\r\nvia the Net. So I’m glad that the Net has worked for me.” I was, too,\r\nand I wished him all kinds of wonderful surprises ahead. Chivalrous\r\nSMHGs like Lee Chen should be more than peripherals.\r\n\r\nNet Adultery\r\n\r\nPlaces like New York or Tokyo abound with museums, art galleries, movie\r\nhouses, universities, and large pools of single people who hope to meet\r\nthe same. Something else, however, awaits those looking for it—more\r\nopportunities for adultery than in small towns. And it is the same with\r\nthe Internet. It isn’t just that straying wives and husbands can use\r\nthose identity-stripping computers in Finland to make swap shopping\r\neasier. More importantly, the Internet teems with bright, funny, people\r\nwho hate convention, including, in some cases, marriage.\r\n\r\nFor a stretch, a support-style mailing list came across as a Peyton\r\nPlace in cyberspace. A man and a woman met there. He told her he would\r\nbe leaving his wife and children. She spent that weekend with a _third_\r\nmember of the list; after the original man publicly confessed, she\r\npopped up out of the blue to give her side. If anyone doubted that\r\ncomputers could bring people together in person, this was proof positive\r\nin the worst way. Most members of the list were horrified. They pleaded\r\nfor Peyton Placers to go offline. Clearly the Internet does not turn\r\npeople into saints—it just makes it easier to do what comes naturally,\r\ngood or bad.\r\n\r\nBut some context, please. The same Net could bring together\r\nold-fashioned romantics. As shown by the Smith-Olson pairing, the Net\r\ncould actually _strengthen_ traditional values among those who so\r\ninclined.\r\n\r\nBesides, much of the illicit action on the Net was by the mutual consent\r\nof husbands and wives. When I ventured into a seamy area called\r\nalt.personals.poly, I saw an ad posted by a swinging couple from\r\nFlorida. “I am 6′3″ brown haired, considered attractive,” said Hank*,\r\nthe husband. “She is 5ʹ0″ busty, blonde, blue eyes, very pretty. We’re\r\nnot weird or disturbed or wanting to beat people, hahaha. We are very\r\nsensual, passionate, and are good at ya know the fun stuff.” Was this\r\nthe ’Bahn that Bill and Al had in mind for us? Not quite. But it wasn’t\r\nas if some pervert was cheating on his wife and hiding behind an\r\nanonymous server while lusting for a nineteen-year-old coed who was new\r\nto both life and the Net. Although I did not condone Hank’s swinging, I\r\nactually felt a little sorry for him after he wrote me a short but\r\ntouching letter: He told how a woman had stood him up and the Missus.\r\nBetter luck next time, Hank.\r\n\r\nSuppose, however, that a man and woman had been married for fifteen\r\nyears and had two children, he was a straight-arrow programmer type, she\r\nwas funny and sexy, he introduced her to the Internet, and she got\r\ncrushes on men whom she befriended over the wire—a marriage just might\r\nfall apart because a stranger might actually fly in from out of town\r\nwanting to get to know her in a biblical way. Such was the case of Phil*\r\nand Jayne*. While I have scrambled the details of the story, it is\r\nentirely true in spirit. They lived in Cincinnati, and Bill worked as a\r\nprogrammer and an Internet administrator for his employer. He had\r\narranged for his wife to be able to dial up the office computer from\r\nhome and send and receive e-mail. That, as we’ll learn in a moment, was\r\na key fact.\r\n\r\nIn many ways Phil and Jayne were a contrast. He could “readily repair my\r\nhurt emotions when it comes to betrayal, be it from friends, or from my\r\nwife.” Phil held himself to the highest of standards no matter how\r\nlow-minded the rest of the cosmos was. Jayne, on the other hand, was\r\nwild and loved to party and speak up. “She can drink anyone under the\r\ntable,” Phil said. “She has a loud voice and a happy disposition. She\r\ncan talk to anyone and make them feel at ease. She is a joy to be with.\r\nA blonde with striking blue eyes. She has the attitude of a redhead but\r\nwe never fight. She rarely sports a smile, but when she does, it is\r\nradiant. She has an excellent body, but she keeps on thinking it is not\r\nquite desirable. She has gone in for plastic surgery because of her low\r\nself-esteem.”\r\n\r\nFor some years in her life, Jayne suffered from another\r\nproblem—stodginess, of all things. Taxiing children around, nagging them\r\nto do their schoolwork, playing the good mother, had made her too\r\nconservative. Phil wanted the old sparks back. So he introduced her to\r\n“an e-mail friend of mine who had been a catalyst for many parties as\r\nwell. I hoped this would spur her into action.” It did. She began a love\r\naffair over the Net. “I often ran to the computer room after getting\r\nhome from work to find Jayne engrossed in some letter writing. She would\r\nimmediately cover the screen and ask me to leave. I could see the\r\ndiscomfort in her face. This was one of my clues to ask around and to\r\ncheck up on what might be happening. I caught them in the act in a swank\r\nhotel.” For the sake of the children, however, Phil forgave her and did\r\nnot divorce. He even revived his friendship with his e-mail friend.\r\n\r\nA second man, however, cuckolded Phil a few years later, and like the\r\nfirst, he was an alcoholic. “He would hound her,” Phil said, “and send\r\ncopious amounts of e-mail, call her from wherever he was regardless of\r\nhow distant. He had an attitude that ‘no one can tell him what to do,\r\neven if it is an affair.’” So Phil, despite his forgiving nature, did\r\nwhat many red-blooded men would have done in his place as a local\r\nInternet administrator. He deleted their electronic mail from the office\r\nsystem. “The second affair rekindled after the lover’s wife left him,”\r\nPhil says. Lawyers successfully pried Jayne and the man apart.\r\n\r\n“She has ‘fallen’ into love with other people on the Net,” Phil said,\r\nhowever, “and some have even taken the trouble to fly in to meet her.”\r\nFortunately the moon and the stars and the hormones weren’t right. So\r\nwhere on the Net did Jayne hook up with these winners? Alt.sex.wanted?\r\nNo, Phil said—rec.humor. And he actually feared rec.humor more than he\r\ndid the plain, sex-oriented areas of the Net, because it might pave the\r\nway for a relationship based on more than carnal impulses.\r\n\r\nI asked, “As a local Net administrator, do you think that people on the\r\nNet play around more or less than does the general population?”\r\n\r\n“About the same,” Phil said. “But there are a lot more insecure\r\npersonalities acting out an alternate personality on the net. This will\r\noften lead, I think, to more misunderstandings. Someone can appear to\r\nlove you a lot, over e-mail, but cannot carry through in person.” And\r\nthen Phil came up with another fascinating insight, which could also\r\napply to some relationships on the Internet between single people. He\r\nobserved that certain Netfolks really didn’t care that much about the\r\nmen or women at the other end. Rather they used electronic mail as a\r\ndiary. “Jayne cherished the e-mail she got from one of her lovers,” Phil\r\nsaid, “but in person he is a lying, cheating, and abusive drunk with a\r\nfar more shallow agenda.”\r\n\r\nPhil and Jayne were doing what they could to repair the damage. The two\r\nhad undergone marriage counseling. “Stop trying to think so much,” Phil\r\nwas told. “This makes you appear to be walking on eggshells, making it\r\nharder for Jayne to be honest with you.” I hoped the counseling would\r\nwork. As if her infidelity weren’t enough, she now cried because she\r\nmight have contracted the virus that causes AIDS. “One of her lovers has\r\nslept around a lot and shot up drugs,” Phil said. “He hasn’t seen a\r\ndoctor in ages because of his alcoholic tendencies, and on one occasion\r\nhe has said he could have the HIV virus. I assured Jayne ... we will\r\nhandle any result from the test one day at a time.” The same thought\r\nmight apply to his life with Jayne. One day at a time. In the future, I\r\nhoped, she won’t be so secretive about the dots on her computer screen.\r\n\r\nGreg and Sue, an Update\r\n\r\nI promised to update you on Greg and Sue. In late May 1995 Greg told me\r\nthey were still moving ahead, except that they’d decided it would be\r\nmuch easier for her if they lived in the States. He would arrive at the\r\nKansas City airport on Wednesday, July 12, at 11:11 P.M. on American\r\nAirlines. “My parents know,” he said. “On the surface they’re bitchy\r\nabout it—well, Mum is—but underneath they’re cool with it. Especially my\r\ndad. He wants to come too.” The older Smith had taken his family to\r\nColorado years earlier during a teacher-exchange program.\r\n\r\n“Work?” Greg went on. “Heck, I can do a lot of things. My preference\r\nwould be systems administrator or network maintenance or even Internet\r\nguru-trainer.”\r\n\r\nJokes about Adelaide’s sleepiness notwithstanding, Greg would miss life\r\ndown under. He cherished “the laid-back nature of Australia. I spend a\r\nlot of time talking to people, and in 99 of 100 cases, the shopkeeper\r\nwill take time out to have a chat about something going on in the world.\r\nPeople are so open and friendly, gosh darnit. I mean friendly, not\r\nlazy.” He would hate to give up, too, the summer days at the sea, the\r\nmusic festivals of Adelaide, and the programs of the Australian\r\nBroadcasting Commission (“it’s government funded and turns up some\r\nreally cool and alternative stuff”). He would also miss Australian Rules\r\nFootball. “Mostly that’s an art form,” Greg said. “Unlike NFL, every\r\nplayer has to be able to do every other player’s job. There’s no offense\r\nor defense, and it’s such a quick game that offense can turn into\r\ndefense in the blink of an eye.”\r\n\r\nE-mailing me on a rainy, thundery day—from “America’s Heartland soon to\r\nbe changed to America’s Flood Plain”—Sue wrote: “Thoughts and hopes?\r\nWell, I think the one thing I’ve had to struggle with lately is facing\r\nup to the fear that we won’t get along. I know there’s a chance. I’ve\r\npretty much come to grips with it, so I think that’s a good sign. I\r\nthink we’ll work it out. I _hope_ we will, but that’s yet to be\r\nforetold—I’m just looking forward to finally meeting my best friend.\r\n\r\n“Where we’ll live is a little uncertain. I’m still making the rounds of\r\napartment complexes, trying to pick one that I like, that I think he’ll\r\nlike, and that is central to work and school.\r\n\r\n“Telling people about Greg and me is a little tricky. Most of the people\r\nI work with understand the basic concept of the Internet, but don’t\r\nreally understand the idea of love at first talk session. I’ve pretty\r\nmuch just told people I met Greg through friends. It just makes things a\r\nlot easier, seeing as how I don’t have to explain things over and over\r\nagain. Maybe it’s a cop-out, but everyone knows how committed I am to\r\nGreg regardless of how we met, and that’s the important thing.\r\n\r\n“My father remains in the dark,” she said. “My mom and I had a big\r\ndiscussion about things and she felt that was the best way to handle\r\nthings with him. I’m just taking things one step at a time and dealing\r\nwith them as they come. I don’t want to throw it all in his face. He’s\r\nstill my daddy and has the best interest of his baby girl at heart.”\r\nEarlier I’d told Sue that the hassles would vanish when she met Greg,\r\nand she had agreed. “’Cept maybe the fact Greg will be the tallest one\r\nat family reunions *grin*. We’ll all be arguing over whose side of the\r\nvolleyball net he’s on. Mine of course. :-) *grin*.”\r\n\r\nSue brought me up to date on work and school. Recently she’d switched\r\njobs and was now a file clerk for an appliance company where the pay was\r\nhigher and the boss friendlier. “I can pretty much study during the slow\r\nperiods, which helps a great deal, *brandishes her grade card*. Got it\r\nin the mail today—all A’s. I’m framing this sucker—I actually pulled an\r\nA in algebra!”\r\n\r\nHer net.lover was getting a cc of the note to me. “Oh, Greg,” she\r\ncouldn’t resist adding, “I did some rearranging for you today. I think\r\nyou might be able to have a drawer or two in the dresser *grin* just\r\nkidding. I cleaned my room today and vacated one-half of my drawer\r\nspace, a major accomplishment almost tantamount to the A in algebra.\r\nJust don’t look in the closet.”\r\n\r\nRedirecting the note back to me, Sue said: “I’ve always been up front\r\nwith Greg about who I am and how I look and how I act and all that\r\nstuff. There’s going to be a lot of rough edges we’ll need to smooth\r\nout, but I’d say we’ve got a strong foundation to build on.” Concluding,\r\nSue said she had undergone a round of antibiotic-hormonal treatments for\r\nan ulcer and gained weight. “The bad news is the weight gain that went\r\nalong with it. Least now I have the bust to fill out my bathing suit.”\r\n\r\nA few days later I heard from Greg. Uh-oh. “To put it bluntly,” he\r\nwrote, “I am not a happy camper.” I hoped I hadn’t offended him. He and\r\nSue had given so much of themselves by sharing their letters with me. As\r\nI read on, I found out the true reason for his dismay. It wasn’t an\r\never-curious writer, or parents, or friends, or professional colleagues:\r\nGreg had graduated from school and was doing fine with temporary\r\nconsulting work. “Visa—problem, big problem. My visitor’s visa has been\r\ndenied on the grounds that I have insufficient reason to return to\r\nAustralia. The upshot of this is that our wedding and my travel plans\r\nhave been severely disrupted, delaying us by anything upwards of about\r\ntwo months—gawd, I hate the sound of that. I talked to Sue on the phone\r\nlast night-her morning, and we’re confident we can make it through\r\nthis.”\r\n\r\nIn character Greg was using the Net, and specifically the newsgroup\r\nalt.visa.us, to help him cope with the visa’crats.\r\n\r\n“It makes no sense to me that the U.S. government won’t let in someone\r\nwith a college degree that’s in demand in this country,” Sue wrote, “and\r\nwho speaks English with such a sexy accent.”\r\n\r\nShe had one last update later in June: “There’s one thing you _have_ to\r\nchange in your chapter, and it’s just one line. I went to the oncologist\r\nand he said I’d had enough tissue regeneration that was healthy to give\r\nme some hope of being able to have kids. So I guess I just might get to\r\nexplore the world of labor pains and stretch marks after all. _Ugh._\r\n\r\n“And I know this sounds cheezy, but would you mind altering names?”\r\n\r\nI was happy to oblige.\r\n\r\n“The press here in Kansas City,” Sue said, “has an absolute field day\r\nwith stuff like this. A guy got a mail-order bride from Russia a year or\r\nso ago, and they had a five-part segment on his life story in the paper\r\nand on the news. I’d just rather not be looked at as someone who had to\r\ngo to a whole other country to find a date. Which is how my father puts\r\nit *sigh*.”\r\n\r\nOh, she had finally told. I wished I could see her father’s face when\r\nGreg actually materialized in K.C. In the most direct way Fred Olson*\r\nmight understand how fortuitously the Net had enlarged his daughter’s\r\nrange of choices. What counted wasn’t her finding a man, but the best\r\nman for her—whether he was next-door or an ocean away.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo that was how matters stood with Sue and Greg as the presses were\r\nabout to turn. I pondered the visa problem. Damn the feds. Already the\r\nayatollahs of the Senate had been trying to turn the Internet into _Mr.\r\nRoger’s Neighborhood_, while the crew in the White House was crusading\r\nto make the Net more snoop-friendly. Now Washington was getting in the\r\nway of both a romance and a more definitive ending to my love chapter.\r\n\r\nAs I typed those words I was listening to a RealAudio replay of Senator\r\nJames Exon pushing his censorship bill on the Senate floor—an outrage\r\nthat could harm not only net.sex but net.love, given the major danger of\r\nabusive enforcement. I loathed the man’s voice. The bullying\r\nselfrighteousness struck me most of all. Exon’s tone was too close to\r\nthat of the late Senator Joseph McCarthy, the anti-communist zealot from\r\nWisconsin. In a very narrow way I regretted that the Cold War was over.\r\nNow the bigots and bullies could focus on _domestic_ troublemakers.\r\nListening to the digitized Exon, I heard him say that a Nebraskan\r\nfootball coach had cheered him on. I reflected. Perhaps the senator and\r\nthe coach could do a RealAudio broadcast from the locker rooms and show\r\nthat in their territory even the after-game talk was G-rated.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts drifted. RealAudio reminded me of another recent wrinkle,\r\nThe Internet Phone, which let Netfolks talk all over the world for free\r\nif they paid flat rates for Net service. What a joy this might be for\r\npeople like Greg and Sue in the days before they rushed into each\r\nother’s arms at the airport.\r\n\r\nThere were a few catches. You needed a deluxe Net connection, alas,\r\nwhich Sue lacked.\r\n\r\nSo she and Greg would still have to reach out and touch type to each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThat wasn’t so bad, actually. They were saving their e-mail, and someday\r\nthe files would remind them of all the promise, all the anticipation,\r\nthat the Net had held out for them in the form of each other.\r\n\r\nAlthough I tinkered with The Internet Phone, I preferred electronic\r\nmail, just as I’d normally favored international Morse code over voice\r\nduring my amateur radio days. Now that art might be lost. Code didn’t\r\nmatter as much on the airwaves as before. The U.S. Coast Guard was\r\nphasing it out. Any future SOS would apparently be in bits and bytes\r\nrather than in dots and dashes, assuming the initials remained at all.\r\nWhat would also perish—writing on screens, eventually? Just what would\r\nhappen to typed words on the Net?\r\n\r\nWhether seriously or just as a discussion provoker, a Seattle columnist\r\nhad imagined the following: “It’s the year 2020; your daughter Emily is\r\nnine years old and she can’t read or write. Is this your worst nightmare\r\nabout our schools come true? Nope, Emily just doesn’t need to read or\r\nwrite anymore.” That, of course, was exactly the kind of nightmare I’d\r\nhad on my mind in proposing TeleRead. We needed graphics, not just\r\nwords; but surely we could do better than the Emily scenario.\r\n\r\nI’d asked Avodah Offit for comments on net.love rather than on the\r\neffects of the technology in general, but she couldn’t help warning\r\nabout the almost inevitable transition of the Net to sounds and images\r\nfor all.\r\n\r\nDelighted by the renaissance of writing on networks, she’d e-mailed me:\r\n“I think two-way TV will bring us down to earth. It will be a loss\r\nrather than a gain to those of us who enjoy using our imaginations and\r\nour writing skills. Right now we all have an opportunity to use the\r\nliteracy that humans have spent thousands of years developing.”\r\n\r\nThat was how I felt, too, whether the topic on the Net was romance or\r\ngerbil care. An old pop lyric came to mind: “These are the good old\r\ndays.” I wondered about the Snubbites and how they would have felt about\r\nGreg and Sue and the many others the Net had brought together; about the\r\nleather-jacketed kids up in Nova Scotia who, for the first time in their\r\nlives, were looking forward to _writing_, however rudimentary the elite\r\nSnubbites might have considered the children’s prose; about all the love\r\nletters that might go unwritten if TV-centric politicians let Emily and\r\nfriends live out their lives as illiterates without electronic books or\r\nkeyboards or equivalents.\r\n\r\nSome things were forever worth our being reactionaries in an enlightened\r\nway. Literacy was one of them. We mustn’t ever let the romance and\r\ncivility of the written word die on the Internet.\r\n\r\nOnce again I recalled some e-mail Sue had sent, in which she had not\r\nmeant to be profound but was. Sue the cancer survivor had reminded us of\r\nthe need to enjoy both Life and Net, and I wanted similar thoughts to\r\ngrace the screens of many lovers, in many countries, and for many years.\r\n“*hugs greg* hold your horses sweetie,” she had written, “I’m typing as\r\nfast as I can....”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Notes\r\n\r\nChapter 1—The Terrain\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.1:\r\n\r\n  The three Net-hostile quotes are from Joshua Quittner’s “Back to the\r\n  real world: New books from the front lines of the information\r\n  revolution urge cyberspace cadets to get a life,” _Time_, April 17,\r\n  1995, page 56.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.2:\r\n\r\n  Luddites, of course, were the loom smashers of the nineteenth century\r\n  who protested automation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.3:\r\n\r\n  Goldberg is author of the book _Questions and Answers about\r\n  Depression_ (Charles Press, 1993), but the book is clearly _not_ his\r\n  main reason for being on Walkers—mentions of _Questions_ have been\r\n  well within limits.

Cable will probably be much better than\r\n  phone connections, the kind the _N & O_ uses. The best cure, of\r\n  course, would be laws that (1) assured the _N & O_ a place on local\r\n  cable and (2) also let the phone companies there go into the cable\r\n  business. Then the _N & O_ could choose between Time Warner and its\r\n  phone company allies of the present. Perhaps such laws will be on the\r\n  books by the time you’re reading this. Meanwhile, I’ll hardly blame\r\n  the people at Time Warner for unofficially talking up cable for the\r\n  Internet; as noted before, I’d do the same, given the technical\r\n  benefits.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17:\r\n\r\n  Conspiracy theorists may take note that another arm of the Newhouse\r\n  interests, Ballantine Books, is distributing _NetWorld!_ for Prima\r\n  Publishing.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.18:\r\n\r\n  Laurie Flynn, “Getting on-line—the Microsoft way,” _New York Times_,\r\n  November 20, 1994, page F10.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.19:\r\n\r\n  The Stahlman and Smith quotes are from “Time Inc. raises its\r\n  multimedia profile with an Internet test,” by Deirdre Carmody, _New\r\n  York Times_, October 24, 1994, page D10.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.20:\r\n\r\n  Laura Fillmore, “Online publishing: Threat or menace,” speech to the\r\n  Online Publishing Conference, Graphic Communications Association,\r\n  March 1993.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.21:\r\n\r\n  Ibid.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.22:\r\n\r\n  Ibid.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.23:\r\n\r\n  Fillmore, “Slaves of a new machine: Exploring the for-free/for-pay\r\n  conundrum,” Fifth Conference on Organizational Computing,\r\n  Coordination, and Collaboration: “Making Money on the Internet,”\r\n  Austin, Texas, May 10, 1994.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.24:\r\n\r\n  Ibid.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.25:\r\n\r\n  Vannevar Bush, “As we may think,” _The Atlantic Monthly_, July 1945.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.26:\r\n\r\n  Interview with Fillmore.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.27:\r\n\r\n  Fillmore, “Slaves.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.28:\r\n\r\n  Ibid.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.29:\r\n\r\n  Ibid.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.30:\r\n\r\n  Ibid.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.31:\r\n\r\n  Rory J.
